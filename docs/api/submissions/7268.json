Either way the naming convention would've only ever worked with the first two born biological or not. If your parents gave been good to you like you said it seems a little silly to get so worked up over something like this.", "YTA\n\nParents (families) have all kinds of naming conventions. It sounds like they are parents who love and treasure you, and they picked a name to honor an important person.\n\nI get that you\u2019re hurting, but what more do you want? They didn\u2019t name you something disparaging; they had a third child (you) and that made them choose a different convention. It\u2019s one that can be equally special to the reason they chose your older siblings names. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re \u201cless than\u201d to them. They were allowed to change their mind about what is important when it comes to names.", "Ya need to apologize. Not in your boat so won't trivialize how you feel about this but ya not cool YTA", "YTA.  Your parents took you in and gave you a family name, and you feel that you were wronged?  If anything, they showed their preference for you in choosing to name you after an important family member.  Your hurt feelings are displaced.", "I'm going with yta. They have still included you as part of thr family you honour your grandmother's name. \n\nYour older siblings were named 8 and 4 years before.\n\n If they have been good parents otherwise, loved you and cared for you like your older siblings. Why get petty over the first letter of a name ? You've been named after someone they clearly love which I feel is more sentimental. \n\nBut that's me personally and I wouldn't want to choose this hill to die on.  I wouldnt want to lose the respect of my family for screaming at them and not talking to them for a week over the first letter of a name.", "YTA. They named you after her mom so obviously they think of you as part of the family! What more can you want?", "You are blowing this way out of proportion. They named you after your mom's mom. They actually put some thought into your name. You need to talk to your mom. I can understand you having feelings about it, but they obviously loved you. Call your mom.", "YTA.\n\nShe named you for her mother. What greater love is there? Why are you looking to stir the turd?", "YTA it's not like there was a third parent to name you after", "YTA - sorry, i almost thought with the \u201ccollege tuition\u201d joke they named you a specific thing to get college funds from (ethnicity wise) but it\u2019s just a little thing about naming their first kids like will and jada did with willow and jaden. there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with being named after your grandmother, and it\u2019s probably more sentimental than being named after a little naming trend. i sincerely think you\u2019re more upset about being adopted than bio and you feel like the naming thing has anything to do with it when it doesnt. what trivial play on your parents name would you have liked? and would you be upset to just be another name trend if it had worked out that way? would you be happier as a \u201cdavina\u201d or a \u201candrew/andy\u201d to fit the bio kid name tend? honest question", "YTA.  She named you After Her Mom.", "INFO: Outside of this, have they done anything to make you feel like you\u2019re an outsider?", "YTA\n\nYour feelings are valid, it must be hard to be the only adopted one amongst your siblings. But they didn't name you differently, they kept up the tradition by naming you with the letter of grandma's name. I hope you can see that and appreciate your name, best wishes with everything", "What did you expect them to do?  Duplicate one of their initials?  \n\nThey had used both of their first names, by going to the next generation, they actually did kind of follow the theme?  \n\nHow is this a betrayal?  You were named after your grandma.\n\nYTA", "My brother has a family name, and I don't. That happens sometimes. It's not a sign of favoritism, it's a sign of what names your parents like.", "Info: how old are you?", "YTA. My mom and step-dad gave us the initials J.C.P because they f******* liked JC Penny's. Now that's some lame ass shit. You were named after your grandmother, someone special to them. If they didn't care, then they wouldn't have adopted in the first place.", "It\u2019s ok kiddo.  It sounds like your parents really love you and have done a great job at providing you a loving safe space.  I\u2019m an adoptive mother also and all I can tell you is we make what we think are the right decisions at the time. Things may change or evolve and we may wish we had made a different choice but it all stems from love for you and wanting you to maintain some connection to your birth family.  That was an act of love whether you see it as one or not.  \nIt sounds like you may be feeling a bit down on yourself so projecting some of those feelings on to your mother.  We all do it at times but YTA if you don\u2019t apologize and give your mom one of those strong hugs.  You hurt her, she\u2019s sad and confused.  Let her know you understand she\u2019s doing her best.  That\u2019s all anyone can expect from any of us.  She\u2019s doing her best now you do yours.  Best of luck to you all.", "YTA - For your reaction. You overreacted and lashed out due to irrational hurt feelings. As they said, they didn\u2019t expect to adopt, it sounds like they planned for two so that\u2019s why they named them the way they did. But when they did adopt you, they gave you a name *that is still part of the family.* You follow the naming convention, you were named in the spirit of a family member.\n\nThis sounds like you have some deeper issues and resentments that you might want to work out in therapy. Adopted kids treated with only love and support can still have complex emotions around this infant trauma, so you might want to look into healing old wounds you might not even know are there. You behaved immaturely, possibly because you don\u2019t have the tools to know how to respond to this or how to identify why exactly you\u2019re feeling this way.\n\nYou owe your family an apology, and you owe yourself the chance to heal and grow from this.", "YTA\n\nYour name originates from your grandmother which clearly shows you are still considered very much part of the family\n\nI think you need to go and see a therapist because you are reading way too much into this", "Yta", "YTA.  Your two parents used their initials for the names of their two older children.  Since their initials were already taken when you came into the picture, they chose to continue the tradition by using your grandmother's initial.  You have \\*majorly\\* overreacted for no reason and owe them an apology for your temper tantrum.  Then you should seek professional help for the underlying anger and resentment issues that are causing you to lash out.", "You may not like your name, but the reason they gave you for your chosen name was valid, especially when your mom told you that you were named after her mother.\n\nYou seriously hurt your mom over this and my heart broke reading the part where your mom called asking you if she was a bad mom. You are making a mountain out of a molehill. \n\nYou need to seriously quit being an asshole over this and to apologize to your mom.\n\nAbsolutely, YTA.", "YTA and maybe the biggest one to post here in a long time. GO APOLOGIZE to these 2 people immediately and stop being a 2 year old.", "You're over thinking it. They named you something meaningful for them at the time. They treated you as one of their own so don't let the name create this bad feeling.\n\nBtw, I am named after my father's grandmother, because she died one week before I was born. That doesn't sound great, does it? However, it better than the original name!", "Yta she literally named you after her mom.", "YTA- I get feeling like the odd one out but this is a *you* problem in this scenario.", "YTA. I don\u2019t understand what there is to be mad about? They had already named the previous 2 kids based on their names, so they decided to name you based on your grandma. What is wrong with that? \n\nI really don\u2019t think the fact that they are bio and you are adopted has anything to do with what they chose to name you, unless there is more info that you haven\u2019t shared that would suggest that.", "YTA\n\nYou sound petty and frustrated. The fact is they had two kids and only two parents. How where they gonna keep the naming scheme? Give only one parent 2 kids named after them? Give you a name with both their initials? It wouldn't make sense. But they clearly put effort into your name by choosing a family member. One of your parents own mother. If that doesn't show a commitment to a true familial connection, I don't know what does.\n\nBut even if they gave you a random fucking name, why would it matter? My twin is named after the city my parents started their honeymoon. That's adorable. My birth name (now dead name) was chosen because it was just a name my mum liked. \n\nUnless your name is chosen to insult you or something, it really does not matter. But here it was done to include you in a family.\n\nYour parents loved you from the moment they got you and your name is the fucking proof.\n\nYou apologise to your parents and think a little more next time. You tell your mother she is a great mother and you know that she loves you, ans you love her.", "Yta - shoot my brother is named after my dad,  and I'm named after some random girl my mom went to kindergarten with who wore a fancy coat. \n\nAt least your named after family lol", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey raised you as their own. Presumably in a loving home. They gave you a name which is from your adoptive mother's grandmother. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYet you feel..hurt that they named your siblings different than you? Are you serious?", "YTA. Was yelling over a name really necessary? You were named after a family member, not somebody they hated. Take it as a compliment.", "YTA. Sure you get to have your feelings, but they're not doing any good for you right now. Unless they've given you other reasons to feel othered and not part of the family (and you say she hasn't been a bad mom), this is an overreaction. Step back, reflect and learn from this.", "YTA, and from some of the comments here and your own you have no legitimate reason to feel otherized from your parents. The way you started this tells me all I need to know. It is YOU who otherized yourself through this entire post. \n\nYou  need to stop making trouble where none exists, and be okay with how things are. They obviously love and care about you, and gave you a family name. No one names a child a family name if they don't care about them. \n\nYou need to get this chip off your shoulder OP", "YTA\nI am waiting for the post of your siblings that complain, that they are named with any name with the same letter and you became a special emotional name and was named after a beloved grandma.\n\nYou are over reacting..Your parents love you.\nAnd think about the logic:\nYour sister already starts with A. They would have need to decide whether to start your name with A again or D like your father. Instead they were like: \"Now it's a girl again. Best chance to give her my grandmas name. So they are connected with a special bond, independent from their blood.\" \n\nGetting the name of your grandma is a great act of love. You got the best name from your siblings with the deepest meaning.", "YTA. They named you after your mom's mom- that's still really special. I actually think that's more meaningful than just sharing a first initial with a parent. \n\nFWIW, my sister and brother have *the exact same names* as my parents. My name? Totally random, no meaning, nothing. It's never bothered me.", "YTA. You don't want a name that starts with the same letter as your older sibling. It's nothing but trouble.", "YTA\n\nYou need therapy.", "YTA. You definitely need help. Seek it and be at peace.", "YTA\n\nIt's understandable that you feel pushed out, but they most likely didn't do it to push you out. People's mindset with naming their kids change. My parents gave me and my little bro a second name from our grand-parents, and by the time my second little bro arrived the names were taken, so they gave him a name from a nice saint. It's not that they cared less about his second name, their need for honoring their parents had been fulfilled so they had another idea for the third.", "You are overthinking this. My oldest brother and oldest sister are both named after our parents. Me and my other two siblings, just names they liked at the time we were born. \nThe way I see it, they didn't know when eldest brother was born they'd have another son / child and ditto with my eldest sister. It's of zero consequence to me and literally means nothing with regards to how my parents felt/feel about me/my other siblings.", "YTA - is this really a big deal? your parents adopted you, loved you, raised you and still love you. they chose to name you another way, they still named you and it's in honor of another beloved family member. i think this is not a big issue to cause a family rift over.", "YTA - All the names are meaningful to them. The first born got names that started with each parents name. There are only 2 parents so that was evenly split. You came along and  they gave you a name that was meaningful to them, which is being named after your mother's mother. I don't think you were left out at all. IF anything they actually gave you a name that was even more special to them than the bio kids. Yes they got a name that started with the first letter of their name (but other than that it is absolutely unrelated) but you got a name that is actually in the family. You're making a mountain out of not even a molehill. They took you in when they didn't have to, (by all accounts) here gave you a good life, and you are not talking to them because you are being petty about a name. Seriously you need to apologize to them asap.", "soft yta\n\nman, just go and apologise. your siblings came first and they probably didnt think about adopting another child from the start. they didnt give you a random name, they gave you your grandmothers name, which they wouldnt have done if it didnt mean a lot to them.\n\nyour reaction was way over the top. imo its even a greater honor to get a name associated with her own mother whom they loved and respected.", "YTA. Stop being petty and looking for reasons to be pissed off. Honestly, one could argue that you being named after your grandmother is even more special than using names with the same first initial. They\u2019re honoring you and your grandmother\u2026.if that doesn\u2019t scream family, I don\u2019t know what does.", "Yta- you\u2019ve definitely got some unresolved feelings that need therapy. Go do some internal work and figure out what you\u2019re really mad about. Don\u2019t tantrum about nothing for dramas sake. Did you want to be petted and renamed?", "Keep in mind that they gave birth to your siblings.   They have to care for them.   But you, they CHOSE!  Then they named you based on one of their parents,  not themselves.   That's a high honor. \n\nAlways keep in mind that you were chosen.   Remember that when you have any doubts.", "I don't think you're an asshole, but I suspect you're pretty young, and if this is the biggest problem you have in your life right now, you're lucky. You were named after your grandmother. That's sweet. Your parents chose you. That's fortunate. Life is good. Don't go looking for problems. Things could be worse.", "YTA. And possibly a lunatic. Wtaf? Who puts that much thought into a name? Jfc chill out.", "Yes. YtA.", "YTA. You're over thinking it. There's only two parents and they used the initials of their first names with their first two children. For their third they choose a family name yet changed it, a distant language, most likely to allow their third child to be an individual while all honoring family. My guess is if you were s boy they would have done the same thing but with one of the grandpas. \nYou were named after your grandmother, that's quite often a significant thing. Your brother and sister were not named after family, they only share first initials with mom and dad. Maybe they have familial middle names but they still don't share the connection you do.  \nSomeday you may become a parent and you'll have to run the gambit of banking a child. Its not an easy thing. Do you honor family? Do something totally different? Follow the current trend? No matter what you do at some point your kid will tell you they hate their name just like you're doing to your parents", "Not an AH as such, but I think maybe there\u2019s a deeper meaning to these feelings atm. I think maybe the names aren\u2019t really the problem. Now might be a good time to look into getting some counselling while you process what your adoption means to you. It\u2019s not uncommon to wonder or question things as you grow older. Best of luck.", "INFO: OP, is this an Iranian Yoghurt situation? If you feel othered or treated differently in general, your behavior here makes sense as a straw that broke the camel's back, but if you are cutting contact with your entire family for a week and running away because of just this naming incident, you're massively overreacting. Either way, the real advice is you probably need a professional therapist to work through these feelings, potentially with your family.", "Here's where I say, sorry, but YTA.  I'm (44F) adopted and am the oldest child of three.  My younger sister (42F) is pretty much named after my mother (differently spelled version of my mother's name.)  I'm probably one of the most common names in North America for the year I was born and for at least 5 years on the other side.   My brother (23M) (different mother) has probably the most common name for men/boys in North America.  I don't really care that I don't have a \"family name\" like my sister.  I joke though that with all 3 names my parents (Mother/Father, Father/Bonus Mom) are the most unimaginative name givers EVER.  Have you parents done anything to actually make you think they don't love you?", "YTA. They named you after a family member.", "NAH they had already used those two, they moved on to using their parents. You have insecurity issues.\n\n\n They don't love you less. Remember that. They chose you. If anything that means they love you a little bit more, but don't tell your siblings that.", "It sounds like you might benefit from therapy. I'd say NAH because you may not realize that you need to work through being adopted, and this might have been the thing that triggered it.", "I\u2019m not going to comment on whether YTA or not but it reminds of a family I know. 7 kids, both boys and girls. First 6 kids all start with the same letter. 7th kid does not.

It's really not that deep.\n\nWhat is deep though, is that your parents didn't \"other\" you, they thoughtfully gave you a name representing your grandmother so they could continue the tradition. Spoiler alert, they did this because you were no different than your siblings to them. \n\nIf anything, you should recognize that your name is even more meaningful, as it is from someone they love, and not just a prideful extension of themselves, the way your siblings names are. \n\nHonestly OP, it's not unusual for adopted kids to feel \"othered.\" It's kind of a given that you'll feel that way at some point. Humans have irrational brains that compell us to have children by manipulating our emotions. But we're humans, and have consciousness that allows us to go above our programming and do what your parents did. \n\nYou're irrational brain is looking for reasons to be \"othered.\" Your parents *chose* you with their full consciousness knowing they would love you no different.

Connecting you to grandma/extended family mattered as well. \n\nBut what they can\u2019t do - by name or any other means - is make it so no aspect of adoption will be painful.  \n\nI do believe that not speaking if you normally would (if you\u2019re in the same household, if you make regular calls) is abusive and not just self-protective and it should be avoided if the relationship is worth preserving.  A time out to process new information or feelings? Ok. To punish? No.  \n\nIf you want any kind of relationship with them you may have to accept that what they thought was a gift (your name) missed the mark for you.

There is no name more beautiful and meaningful to me in the entire world than my mom's, which is why I wanted to give it to my daughter.

You want the one who inspired the name to be proud, and you want the one named to feel connected to a legacy greater than themselves and have someone to look up to. You get a special connection and a special bond if you\u2019re lucky. In being named after the grandma in another language, they gave you all of that and a sense of distinction and uniqueness.

Go apologize to your mother and father, and tell them how much you love them and how greatful you are to have them in your life.", "YTA. They named you after a relative who obviously meant a lot to them.\n\nYour reaction would be justified if they treated you differently (eg treating you like you're not part of the family because you're adopted) but if they still treat you the same as your siblings then you just sound like a brat tbh.\n\nAre you sure there isn't more to this?

I understand your feelings, but they're really knee jerk, and it doesn't seem like you've thought it through much.\n\nThe fact that they used a different naming scheme for your siblings doesn't seem to have anything to do with you being adopted, and more a combination of there being eight years between the naming decisions and the fact that they had already used those two ideas, so they wanted to come up with something new. It seems to me that the way they named you is equally important to them as the way they named your siblings.\n\nI think you need to work through these feelings and realize that they aren't trying to treat you any differently (at least in regards to the names, I have no idea how the rest of your life has been, obviously).
