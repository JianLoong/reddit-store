By nature, this is a seasonal position, that runs for about 6 weeks. 2 weeks into the season, I have an applicant (21F), who tells me she is a single mother, really needs a job, and begs me for as many hours as she can get. As we need alot of help in the morning, I tell her she can have the job, and set up a day for training. I also send her the onboarding packet, and tell her this must be completed before the training (as legally she can\u2019t be on set without a background check). She tells me she will take care of it, I tell her to text me if she has any questions, and I move on with my day. \n\nA few days later, the morning she was supposed to train, she texts me and says she is unable due to an unspecified \u201cfamily emergency\u201d. I understand things happen, so I told her no worries, and scheduled a new second day with her. This morning, the day she was supposed to come in to train for the second time, she texts me again, telling me another family emergency came up, and that she can\u2019t come in. She mentioned wanting to schedule another day, but I just ignored the message and went on with my day. This evening, she messages me \u201c???\u201d in reference to her previous text. I answer her and tell her this job maybe isn\u2019t a good fit. I explain with the seasonal nature, by the time she were to train, and find a place in our schedule, she would barely have 3 weeks of work left. I also told her in the week\u2019s worth of time in between each emergency, I had hired other people who filled up the shifts I was going to give to her. I told her to apply next season, and I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t work out. She responds to this \u201cthat doesn't mean there's gonna be emergencies all the time that was kind of rude for you to say never mind I'm OK!\u201d \u201cMy grandma passed away tonight! but thanks anyways!\u201d and that I am an asshole. She then threatens to call my company customer support number and complain about me, to which I responded with the number and told her to go ahead. I explained again how with the limited run of the season, it would be a waste of time on both of our ends, and that if family emergencies are a common issue for her, this job wasn\u2019t going to work out. She called me an asshole again, and I responded by telling her to stop wasting both of our time, her onboarding packet wasn\u2019t done anyways so she couldn\u2019t even work today, she should maybe look for a permanent job, then I blocked her number. \n\nOn one hand, I understand if stuff happens that may get in the way of employment. But on my end, what is the point of hiring someone that will only be able to work a handful of shifts?

Other people showed up for those shifts, they got the job. I don't fully buy the sudden 'family emergency' story (it's a common thing people do anyway).", "NTA she is clearly unhinged, calling you an ahole for rightfully saying the job isn\u2019t a good fit is insane. Side note: huge props to you for being in a management position at 18. When I was 18 I could barely find matching socks. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing!", "NTA.  Yes, emergencies do happen that will affect your employees' work schedule. But she wasn't an employee yet.", "NTA this is ridiculous. If she can't even show up for training after getting a second chance, that's on her, not you. She did you a favor by showing you how unreliable she was before she started.", "Calling someone who is attempting to hire you an arsehole is pretty unprofessional - not sort of language that will make you change your mind and tell her to come on in.  I understand emergencies happening.  I had one on a first day of a job, I was involved in a car accident (with a truck) on the way to the job.  And I had to get police involved.  So, I phoned up and explained the story, said I couldn't come in that day but asked if they wanted me to come in the next day or if they wanted to orgainise someone else.  They went with organizing someone else.  It sucked big time as I had a mortgage just in my name which I could barely afford and had to depend on someone else to feed me and then I had this fucking truck attempt to write me off.\n\nBut I would never, NEVER thought about calling them an arsehole for wanting to orgainise someone else.", "NTA; no one is going to hire someone who\u2019s unreliable right off the bat, regardless of why.", "NTA. I would not be surprised if these emergencies are just an excuse and don't really exist.", "NTA  \nI think an employee (or prospective employee) needs to be specific about what the \u2018family emergency\u2019 is when they contact their employer. Not being specific makes everyone assume that there\u2019s no emergency and you just can\u2019t be bothered to turn up.", "NTA and holy crap you dodged a bullet my not hiring her.", "NTA - I keep telling my kids they better get on it if they want a summer job. Didn\u2019t apply until mid June. Going back to school in August. No one wants you for a month and a half? Oops too bad so sad. They were more on top of it second time around.", "NTA. This person was obviously flakey, and you made the right choice.", "NTA", "NTA. I always look at the interview and then pre-first day periods as the time when people really should be putting their best foot forward to convince you to take a chance on them and then prove that you made a good decision. If they are already throwing up red flags, it does not bode well for later when they get more comfortable. \n\nThat said, life does happen and I have definitely rescheduled interviews to accommodate. But I don't think anyone has ever attempted to reschedule twice with only a vague explanation. If I were the applicant, I might say family emergency the first time but if I legitimately had to reschedule a second time I would feel like I needed to explain a little more about the situation and what steps I am taking to prevent further issues going forward.", "NTA, and I would\u2019ve gone with no assholes until she threatened to call your customer complaint line. She doesn\u2019t have a customer complaint- if anything it\u2019s an HR complaint- so she\u2019s essentially threatening to lie to your boss in order to get you in trouble. Automatic asshole status right there. Usually, I think employers are far too insensitive to legitimate family emergencies, but the nature of seasonal employment is clear. If you aren\u2019t able to be there within a very specific timeframe, then you can\u2019t have the job. You accommodated the first missed deadline, and by the time the second missed deadline came around there was no longer time for her to learn and do the job. You even told her she was welcome to apply again next year. Maybe you\u2019d be the asshole if this was a longterm job offer, but seasonal work is finite in terms of both start date and end date. It is very unfortunate for her that the passing of her grandmother caused her to miss the window for this employment opportunity, but that wasn\u2019t your doing. And I very much sympathize with a single mother experiencing financial insecurity heading into the holidays, especially compounded by grief. Imo, she was entitled to a little bit of latitude in terms of her reaction, but not enough latitude to excuse threatening to lie to your bosses in hopes of costing you your job. You\u2019re not the asshole.", "NTA She didn't complete the required paperwork to be allowed to work and not once, but twice had a reason not to show.\n\nIt may very well just be bad timing for her, but that's not on you.", "NTA. You explained the reality of the situation respectfully.", "NTA. If she was already an employee I can understand trying to accommodate. But she hasn\u2019t even onboarded yet. Death happens and it sucks to no end, but there was nothing you can do. And there was nothing she could have done either - really bad luck for her and I hope she has others who can help her out. You don\u2019t owe her anything - you did your best.", "NTA. I know people use that excuse lots, but I don\u2019t get why. I have only ever used it when my mother was at death\u2019s door. She did that 5 times, the 5th time she ended up dying. People doing this when it\u2019s not true are absolute assholes. They ruin it for the rest of us. Unfortunately you made a correct decision. It\u2019s very suspicious when she didn\u2019t give a reason. I gave a reason all 5 times. I happened to share the details but that doesn\u2019t need to be a requirement. You were put into a very tough spot. You made the same decision older more experienced managers would do.  Feel no guilt whatsoever. Even if her emergencies were legit, she still wouldn\u2019t have had much time to work so you would still be NTA.", "NTA - From a management perspective, it is totally understandable to not hire somebody who is unreliable from the very beginning, especially with such a short season. I do think, however, that you could have handled it a little bit differently in your communication with her but that will come with time and experience. Do what you need to for yourself and your business but be mindful of what others are going through as well and give them a chance to explain. If, after doing so, you have to stick with your initial decision, tell them kindly and wish them the best.", "Sounds li9ke she is suppose to get a job to meet some legal issue/requirement ---FAFO and now she is in trouble for not getting a job .

So, while this may result in some down-voting,  I'm going with an ESH - her for not completing the tasks when needed and showing you potential future issues, but also you for how you reacted. She did text you both times she had issues, but the second time you put her on read, which suggests a certain lack of empathy for someone who already told you she was having trouble. You could have responded with something simple initially, just to let her know you got it, and then gone into the problem later. Did you lead with \"this won't work out,\" or did you give her a chance to explain? As someone who works with the public year-round, there's a balance - you're absolutely right that if someone is showing a lack of reliability, they're going to be a difficult worker, but I feel like you could have gone about it in a better way.", "YTA - she texted you twice and you have to be aware as an employer things will happen", "NTA she couldn't even make it to training not once, but twice!

Ignoring her wasn't necessary. It could genuinely not be her fault that stuff came up, but of course, it's still a valid reason to not hire her. However, the benefit of the doubt could still be extended enough to reply to her text. I think silence has gotten far too accepted as a reasonable response by society.\n\nAfter the rest of the nonsense she spewed though, ignoring is 100% warranted.", "INFO: what is the law regarding this matter where you live? If you were acting within the laws applicable to the situation and industry, you were fine. I\u2019m in a management role and it\u2019s a tough mind shift to balance - especially if you are the type of personality that likes to help people, but at the end of the day the business needs to make money, and if the business suffers because of unreliable staff etc, then everyone attached to the business suffers from the clients who want to use your service but end up getting frustrated and spending their money elsewhere, to the other employees who now are taking on additional responsibility or work to make up for someone not pulling their weight. We are currently dealing with someone like that - but here because they aren\u2019t casual and our laws, moving them along if necessary is a lot more involved than people assume. And it sucks - this staff member has it really tough at the moment and the last thing we want to do is add to it, but out industry doesn\u2019t have that much flexibility and we can\u2019t afford to invent work on the off chance they will show up. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t completely crystal clear on your local employment laws though, brush up, because everywhere is so different - some favor employers, some favor employees. \n\nA bit of advice my director has imparted me that has actually helped me over the years - the faces change but the personalities stay the same. And the more I\u2019m learning - the more I\u2019m learning it\u2019s the same in so many industries. \n\nYou made a difficult call - but as long as the law is backing you it was the right one.", "NTA.

It's completely reasonable for her to hire someone else, and it's such a time-sensitive position that not filling it up with other applications could result in a loss for her company or for her own job.", "There's a point at which accommodating an employee because shit happens becomes ridiculous, and missing a second training shift for a 6-week seasonal job is exactly that point.

My father passed away earlier this year. He was in critical condition when I was at work dealing with escalated calls. I called my team leader and it went to voicemail.

You were empathic by understanding her initial issue, being flexible and taking her at her word. She never even did the onboarding packet. You\u2019re not her therapist or her friend - empathy is a two way street, and offering it when you\u2019re getting nothing back is a recipe for becoming a doormat.

If you can, I'd chalk it up to a learning experience for future work. Have a great holiday season!", "You\u2019re 18. Impressive to be handling a position like this at your age, but you can be forgiven for not recognizing how common people like her are. It\u2019s a type every employer and manager recognizes. They are the center of their own universe and they expect the world to always accommodate their needs. They have no sense of responsibility, they will not consider how their actions affect others, and nothing is their fault. There\u2019s no chance they will be good employees. \n\nA reasonable person would have 1) filled out the onboarding paperwork immediately (that\u2019s a given); 2) apologized profusely for the first family emergency, assuring you it won\u2019t happen again; 3) been absolutely horrified when it happened again (assuming both are real, which I don\u2019t actually believe); and 4) maybe not gone with rude text replies and threats. Because any reasonable person would recognize that 3 fuckups before even starting is not a good sign.\n\nThe only thing you did wrong was leave her on read, but it is always best to think for a bit before responding in such a situation so that wasn\u2019t even very wrong. (A curt \u201cI\u2019ll contact you later\u201d would do.) Other than that you handled it very well. You appear to be management material.", "I'm so sorry.", "I am so sorry you lost your father. Sending hugs. \n\nNormally I\u2019m in the camp of \u201cyou don\u2019t owe your employer an explanation\u201d but in this case, a little info goes a long way to explain the situation, especially being a brand new employee (not even) at a job you were begging to get.
