I understand things happen, so I told her no worries, and scheduled a new second day with her. This morning, the day she was supposed to come in to train for the second time, she texts me again, telling me another family emergency came up, and that she can\u2019t come in.

Side note: huge props to you for being in a management position at 18. When I was 18 I could barely find matching socks. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing!", "NTA.  Yes, emergencies do happen that will affect your employees' work schedule. But she wasn't an employee yet.", "NTA this is ridiculous. If she can't even show up for training after getting a second chance, that's on her, not you. She did you a favor by showing you how unreliable she was before she started.", "Calling someone who is attempting to hire you an arsehole is pretty unprofessional - not sort of language that will make you change your mind and tell her to come on in.  I understand emergencies happening.  I had one on a first day of a job, I was involved in a car accident (with a truck) on the way to the job.  And I had to get police involved.  So, I phoned up and explained the story, said I couldn't come in that day but asked if they wanted me to come in the next day or if they wanted to orgainise someone else.  They went with organizing someone else.  It sucked big time as I had a mortgage just in my name which I could barely afford and had to depend on someone else to feed me and then I had this fucking truck attempt to write me off.\n\nBut I would never, NEVER thought about calling them an arsehole for wanting to orgainise someone else.", "NTA; no one is going to hire someone who\u2019s unreliable right off the bat, regardless of why.", "NTA. I would not be surprised if these emergencies are just an excuse and don't really exist.", "NTA  \nI think an employee (or prospective employee) needs to be specific about what the \u2018family emergency\u2019 is when they contact their employer. Not being specific makes everyone assume that there\u2019s no emergency and you just can\u2019t be bothered to turn up.", "NTA and holy crap you dodged a bullet my not hiring her.", "NTA - I keep telling my kids they better get on it if they want a summer job. Didn\u2019t apply until mid June. Going back to school in August. No one wants you for a month and a half? Oops too bad so sad. They were more on top of it second time around.", "NTA. This person was obviously flakey, and you made the right choice.", "NTA", "NTA. I always look at the interview and then pre-first day periods as the time when people really should be putting their best foot forward to convince you to take a chance on them and then prove that you made a good decision. If they are already throwing up red flags, it does not bode well for later when they get more comfortable. \n\nThat said, life does happen and I have definitely rescheduled interviews to accommodate. But I don't think anyone has ever attempted to reschedule twice with only a vague explanation. If I were the applicant, I might say family emergency the first time but if I legitimately had to reschedule a second time I would feel like I needed to explain a little more about the situation and what steps I am taking to prevent further issues going forward.", "NTA, and I would\u2019ve gone with no assholes until she threatened to call your customer complaint line. She doesn\u2019t have a customer complaint- if anything it\u2019s an HR complaint- so she\u2019s essentially threatening to lie to your boss in order to get you in trouble. Automatic asshole status right there. Usually, I think employers are far too insensitive to legitimate family emergencies, but the nature of seasonal employment is clear. If you aren\u2019t able to be there within a very specific timeframe, then you can\u2019t have the job. You accommodated the first missed deadline, and by the time the second missed deadline came around there was no longer time for her to learn and do the job. You even told her she was welcome to apply again next year. Maybe you\u2019d be the asshole if this was a longterm job offer, but seasonal work is finite in terms of both start date and end date. It is very unfortunate for her that the passing of her grandmother caused her to miss the window for this employment opportunity, but that wasn\u2019t your doing. And I very much sympathize with a single mother experiencing financial insecurity heading into the holidays, especially compounded by grief. Imo, she was entitled to a little bit of latitude in terms of her reaction, but not enough latitude to excuse threatening to lie to your bosses in hopes of costing you your job. You\u2019re not the asshole.", "NTA She didn't complete the required paperwork to be allowed to work and not once, but twice had a reason not to show.\n\nIt may very well just be bad timing for her, but that's not on you.", "NTA. You explained the reality of the situation respectfully.", "NTA. If she was already an employee I can understand trying to accommodate. But she hasn\u2019t even onboarded yet. Death happens and it sucks to no end, but there was nothing you can do. And there was nothing she could have done either - really bad luck for her and I hope she has others who can help her out. You don\u2019t owe her anything - you did your best.", "NTA. I know people use that excuse lots, but I don\u2019t get why. I have only ever used it when my mother was at death\u2019s door. She did that 5 times, the 5th time she ended up dying. People doing this when it\u2019s not true are absolute assholes. They ruin it for the rest of us. Unfortunately you made a correct decision. It\u2019s very suspicious when she didn\u2019t give a reason. I gave a reason all 5 times. I happened to share the details but that doesn\u2019t need to be a requirement. You were put into a very tough spot. You made the same decision older more experienced managers would do.  Feel no guilt whatsoever. Even if her emergencies were legit, she still wouldn\u2019t have had much time to work so you would still be NTA.", "NTA - From a management perspective, it is totally understandable to not hire somebody who is unreliable from the very beginning, especially with such a short season. I do think, however, that you could have handled it a little bit differently in your communication with her but that will come with time and experience. Do what you need to for yourself and your business but be mindful of what others are going through as well and give them a chance to explain. If, after doing so, you have to stick with your initial decision, tell them kindly and wish them the best.", "Sounds li9ke she is suppose to get a job to meet some legal issue/requirement ---FAFO and now she is in trouble for not getting a job .

So, while this may result in some down-voting,  I'm going with an ESH - her for not completing the tasks when needed and showing you potential future issues, but also you for how you reacted. She did text you both times she had issues, but the second time you put her on read, which suggests a certain lack of empathy for someone who already told you she was having trouble. You could have responded with something simple initially, just to let her know you got it, and then gone into the problem later. Did you lead with \"this won't work out,\" or did you give her a chance to explain?

If you were acting within the laws applicable to the situation and industry, you were fine.

We are currently dealing with someone like that - but here because they aren\u2019t casual and our laws, moving them along if necessary is a lot more involved than people assume. And it sucks - this staff member has it really tough at the moment and the last thing we want to do is add to it, but out industry doesn\u2019t have that much flexibility and we can\u2019t afford to invent work on the off chance they will show up. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t completely crystal clear on your local employment laws though, brush up, because everywhere is so different - some favor employers, some favor employees. \n\nA bit of advice my director has imparted me that has actually helped me over the years - the faces change but the personalities stay the same.

They have no sense of responsibility, they will not consider how their actions affect others, and nothing is their fault.

I had to work to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table.\n\nI have also been the boss who let someone go bc they don't meet the job requirements? Yes, and that sucks too.", "NTA. If you're having back to back emergencies, it's clearly not a good time. Like, yes, shit can happen like that. But particularly going into the holiday season, things are going to crop up unexpectedly. If you're the person in the family who has to handle all those things, now is not the time to try getting a job that only exists for 6 weeks. Particularly when the application process requires things that take time, like a background check.", "NTA. She is an unreliable flake. What sustained family emergency prevented her from completing her onboarding packet? The cynic in me says she was hoping you wouldn\u2019t notice she didn\u2019t turn in her background check form.", "NTA: You have a business to run. A someone else said, she is unhinged. Plus, she called you names...she is toxic, at best. I'm glad you blocked her number.", "Why is she texting you the day her grandma died? Yeah she\u2019s got a ton of tales none of them true. Worked at the same company with someone like her. Hired from part time to full time, announced on Friday. Supposed to start Monday 8-4, calls out then, Tuesday, Wednesday shows up Thursday calls out again on Friday but shows up to get her check because her direct deposit didn\u2019t go through. For the next several years her MO was out every Monday and Friday. Why it went in for so long??? The company had bigger issues with a sr manager using a department for his sex conquests, sexual harassment suits so yeah she got by.", "Info! Did she ever sign employment documents or did it never get that far? It sounds like her family emergencies were big ones and she was trying to manage them without it affecting you but the reality is that she never completed training and you had to keep hiring.", "NTA you gave her three chances between her background check and two same-day cancellations. Her life is too complicated for her to be reliable.", "NTA. Regrettably you are right. While I'm gullible enough to assume that she isn't lying in this situation, at the end of the day you have your on responsibilities and if accomidating her gets in the way of those, you must make a choice. Navigating family issues and the imployment she says she needs, is her responsibility.", "NTA. She has an opportunity to learn how jobs work. If you repeatedly can\u2019t show up an employer will not save your spot. The excuses would never stop with this one.  You need to run a business and did what was necessary.", "Nta", "A few years ago, my grandparents and father passed away within a year of each other.\r  \nAt that time, I really often had emergencies\r  \nBecause they are often hospitalized", "Did she try to prove her grandma had died? Just curious as sometimes people have grandparents die over and over again. \n\nNTA It\u2019s a tough thing to do, but she hadn\u2019t even started yet.", "NTA. Your reasoning is correct, there\u2019s really no point halfway through a 6 week job. You seem to have acted professionally and even gave her the number to make a complaint.", "NAH", "NTA. An employee who can't show up to work is useless.", "NTA and wow! You are going places!", "NTA. No matter what the job is, if a potential hire has to reschedule twice off the bat, most companies would rescind their offer. Even if it really is just unfortunate timing, it\u2019s still a bad look to employers starting off.", "NTA. As the saying goes, \"The show must go on\". It's terrible timing for her, but there's not much else you could really do for her. That doesn't make you an AH, though I'm suspecting she may not exactly be in her best headspace atm.", "NTA. I was hired with a girl like this. She missed at least 1 day a week due to \u201cemergencies\u201d then eventually stopped showing up entirely because work stopped scheduling her for mornings (it was hard to get someone to come in for her at 7 am if she called out at 6:30). She complained how she wasn\u2019t given enough hours and \u201chow do you expect people to live on 20 hours of pay a week\u201d. Mind you, she was only working 20 hours regardless, it was just whether she was only scheduled for 20 or scheduled for 40 and only showed up for 20. These sorts of people don\u2019t change", "I use to work with a guy whose grandma died at least 5 different times.  Funny how we always had a different manager when she kicked the bucket.  NTA here at all.", "Nta, and you're only eighteen? God I wish I'd had your management chops at that age! That's fantastic. You're going places.", "She hasn't even started yet. This is her on her best behavior. NTA.", "NTA. The woman sounds unhinged and childishly flaky. Any truly committed applicant who genuinely had two incredibly ill-timed family emergencies would be far more apologetic about it and not be so rude to you afterwards.", "NTA. People like that will go through life blaming everyone but themselves.", "NTA. I bet her grandma dies a lot.", "Not your problem.  You were already extremely generous with a second chance.", "NTA. She hadn't even started the background check yet, that was on her. She isn't employed because she is unreliable. Nothing was your doing. Sounds like one of those people who blame everyone else for their problems.", "The number of emergencies made her incompatible with the availability the position required.", "Socks are supposed to match?", "I was thinking the same thing. 18 and so responsible and mature. Very impressive!", ">I understand needing quick work, but if you are unable to complete the first task I ask of you, and then not be reliable, then what is the point?\n\nIndeed, it's wasting everyone's time. NTA", "She didn't even fill out the onboarding so she couldn't even get trained.", "I'm so sorry that happened to you. I hope you've found something else since. Maybe that job did you a favour by letting you go cause any place of employment who would treat someone who had just gotten into an *accident* that callously would not be a good place to work.\n\nAlso OP - NTA", "I bet this woman\u2019s grandma has \u201cdied\u201d numerous times.", "It really depends. If you\u2019ve reliably been working at a place for a long time, then imo it\u2019s fine if you just say \u201cfamily emergency\u201d, especially if it\u2019s something personal. But obviously in this case, it\u2019s better to say what\u2019s going on, since it would help to show that it\u2019s an unusual situation and not a regular occurrence.", "Exactly. Anyone suffering a real emergency would be specific. I wonder how many times this woman\u2019s grandma died. That\u2019s basically every flake\u2019s excuse.", "For prospective employees, absolutely. Once you\u2019ve started, I think it depends on your role. In my field, I\u2019ve found that it is extremely uncommon for people to divulge specifics about family emergencies unless they\u2019re asking for bereavement or extended leave. If you\u2019re only going to be out one day, the response is always, \u201cthanks for the heads up, hope everything is okay.\u201d In this case, however, I agree with you given the nature of the work.", "I worked at a summer camp and when it ended for the season we hired a crew for 2 weeks to close it, cleaning, inventory, putting equipment away, it wasn't hard work. It paid well $20 an hour and a free lunch because the cooks were also closing down and trying to get rid of excess food. One person called in sick the very first day. Then they had to leave early every day for the rest of the week for family emergencies. The second week they called in sick again and our boss told them not to bother coming in. They were mad but really you can't commit to 2 weeks?", "Yeah it really sounds like a family emergency so you can\u2019t come to class to turn in the homework you haven\u2019t done yet.", "I would never even dream of slacking at a new job until my probation is up. I\u2019m always on my best behaviour and being a total try hard for the first 3 months.", "Exactly what I said!", "Zombie grandma!", "She couldn\u2019t even fill out the paperwork! Ridiculous.", "Yes! As a single mom, it kills me when others in my situation play the family emergency card when they are really just being flakey. It ruins opportunities for the rest of us who are serious about work. We have it hard as it is due to stereotypes, and people like this woman just enforce them. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to fill out the paperwork!", "In fact, I believe grandma has \u201cdied\u201d numerous times.", "To me, the only thing op could have done better is not ignore her after the second \u201cemergency\u201d. At just 18, I think op handled it exceptionally well.\n\nI\u2019m a single mom, but it doesn\u2019t cause me to drop the ball repeatedly before even starting a new job. She could have at least completed the paperwork!\n\nIt kills me when people play the single mom and family emergency cards when they are really just being flakey. It ruins job prospects for the single moms who are serious about work. We have it hard as it is. We occasionally miss days when kids are sick or childcare arrangements completely fall through. We work extra hard to make up for the inconvenience these situations cause.", "I don\u2019t think there was any issue in this case. She hadn\u2019t even filled out the onboarding paperwork!", "Nta and the fact she insulted you right away isn\u2019t a good look either. This shows she\u2019s very unreliable and quick to show she doesn\u2019t hold accountability. You\u2019re there for the job and to ensure things run smoothly for other workers. But I totally get it had someone almost do the same thing but tried to get my SM fired. Thankfully the father of coworker handled it quickly when he was told the actual story of what happened.", "NTA Calling the person who pays you an assholes is not good. Her customer service skills would be horrifc.", "Yes. Because they are all black.", "No. Never. Absolutely not. If you have matching socks, you are the devil or something.", "Life\u2019s too short to match socks", "People can have two grandmas, twice at least that excuse can be played.", "That is a legitimate reason to reschedule. If it were the case with this woman, she would have said so instead of being vague, I think.", "i was thinking ' i wonder how many times grandma has died '", "In the Discworld novels by the late great Sir Terry Pratchett, the City Watch have a written policy that every guardsman can only have 2 granny funeral days per year because a guard called Nobby kept taking so many of them and it was unfair on the Golem and the Zombie who were unable to use that excuse to ditch work."]}
