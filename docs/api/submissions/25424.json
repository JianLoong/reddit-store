My younger brother has autism and my older brother has Asperger\u2019s, they both have ADHD. \n\nMy older brother gets into a lot of arguments with my dad regarding his future, when he was in school he didn\u2019t take it seriously his teacher even had to come to our house to get him at least go to class so he could graduate (his senior year was online). Since he turned 18 he has had at least 4 jobs and usually ends up getting fired because he doesn\u2019t want to have a boss. He\u2019s been working on music since he was 13 and he does make money from it but he only spends it on weed and food. All of these things plus more is usually what they argue about. \n\nWell a couple days ago he got into a huge argument with my dad and grandmother I\u2019m not sure how it started or what it was initially about because I\u2019ve started tuning them out but as always I got brought up. For some reason all three of them like to bring me up as a comparison. \n\nNow I do relatively well in school and have had a steady seasonal job since I was 14/15. So this time when I was brought up this is what they were talking about. \n\nAfter the argument ended my brother sent this long message to the family group chat and it basically said was downplaying everything I\u2019ve done and said \u201cNone of that shit she do is impressive without autism she\u2019s basically a junior who does nothing all day and y\u2019all allow it.\u201d (I am a rising senior btw not sure why he said I\u2019m a junior)\n\nMaybe what he said was true but I was still offended and was giving him the silent treatment for days until earlier this morning he asked me to make him some of the food I was making and I just ignored him he kept asking till I said no make it yourself and he kept bugging me asking why I couldn\u2019t just make extra. Then I brought up his text message and said \u201cHaving a disability doesn\u2019t make you special, with or without it you\u2019re lazy.\u201d I put my airpods in and just ignored anything else he said and he walked away. \n\nMy grandma just called and I guess he told her what I said and she told me what I said was rude and uncalled for and that he deserves more credit than that despite all the things he says. My dad is on my side and said he was glad I said something but I do feel a little guilty.

Stand up for yourself. If your dad is \"glad you said something\" maybe he should also be a responsible parent and say something to your brother??", "NTA. I absolutely agree with you. Unless your brother is severely autistic and unable to function, he\u2019s simply using his diagnosis as a reason for not putting in extra effort. Your brother needs to learn that you only get what you work for and unfortunately some people need to work harder than others to get what they want. This has always been true, now we just have a diagnosis to explain why.", "NTA\n\nAs your dad says, your older brother is using his disability as a crutch.  You can have Asperger\u2019s and a job.  You can have Asperger\u2019s and have a good life.  He's choosing to sit on his rear and smoke weed, lashing out when he can.  Good for you to not make him a meal.  When's the last time he made YOU a meal?  Or anyone else, hmm?", "NTA\n\nI have an older sister who had a brain injury from how she came into the world. It wasn't apparent until she was school-aged and then the family focus shifted to her. She hated it; the new \"special\" words, the coddling, the extra attention, and the lies she was told to \"protect\" her self-esteem. \n\n The point I guess I'm making is I haven't experienced your situation but I actually have. \n\n1. Your brother wants extra consideration and attention for his autism. (Never dealt with that)\n2. He's older than you and yet, you are expected to be responsible for his feelings and be mindful to not overshadow him while trying to live your own life. (Yeah, every day.) Parents who go overboard for one kid and leave another one behind are helping neither child.\n\nYou are walking a tightrope. Keep being an advocate for yourself. It isn't AH behavior to say No when you feel the need to say it.", "NTA. Siblings fight.  He was mean; you were mean; you will both hopefully grow up and move on.", "Okay, so maybe take this with a grain of salt, because this is a sibling fight and sibling fights have different boundaries sometimes but I think this is actually a situation where both of you kinda suck. Like, ESH (Everyone sucks here). What your brother said, especially bringing you into it? Asshole thing to say. Your grandmother and father bringing you up as a comparison? Asshole thing to do. But making the \"having a disability doesn't make you special\" jab was unnecessary because it's an ableist thing to say and you don't want to be saying ableist shit, even if your brother started it by putting you down.\n\nI don't know about your brother \"deserving more credit\", but I do know it's absurd for your grandmother to call you out for being rude to him when he started it by bringing you down in a *groupchat.* And your dad is a hypocrite for saying he's on your side when it seems like he didn't do anything about, again, your brother bringing you down in that groupchat. \n\nYou should speak up for yourself, make no mistake. Your brother shouldn't be bringing you into those conversations like that. But your grandmother and your father shouldn't either and they should stick up for you if he does, no hesitation. I think what you said was kinda shitty but it was also understandable. So maybe err on the side of being a little more careful *not* to say ableist shit to your brother but also feel free to be mad as hell because your family shouldn't be dragging you into that stuff.", "NTA I don't see why having ADHD or Aspergers prevents him from having a basic job. He doesn't want a boss? hahahahhahahaaahahaahahaha. That's funny like he thinks other people love having a boss. Sounds like his issue is more that he needs to get over himself.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your brother is lazy and there is no reason he can't be productive with his conditions. He has too much pride to listen to others is his bigger problem."]}
