Both my brothers have autism and ADHD.\n\nMy older brother gets into a lot of arguments with my dad regarding his future, when he was in school he didn\u2019t take it seriously his teacher even had to come to our house to get him at least go to class so he could graduate (his senior year was online). Since he turned 18 he has had at least 4 jobs and usually ends up getting fired because he doesn\u2019t want to have a boss. He\u2019s been working on music since he was 13 and he does make money from it but he only spends it on weed and food. All of these things plus more is usually what they argue about. \n\nWell a couple days ago he got into a huge argument with my dad and grandmother I\u2019m not sure how it started or what it was initially about because I\u2019ve started tuning them out but as always I got brought up. For some reason all three of them like to bring me up as a comparison. \n\nNow I do relatively well in school and have had a steady seasonal job since I was 14/15. So this time when I was brought up this is what they were talking about. \n\nAfter the argument ended my brother sent this long message to the family group chat and it basically said was downplaying everything I\u2019ve done and said \u201cNone of that shit she do is impressive without autism she\u2019s basically a junior who does nothing all day and y\u2019all allow it.\u201d (I am a rising senior btw not sure why he said I\u2019m a junior)\n\nMaybe what he said was true but I was still offended and was giving him the silent treatment for days until earlier this morning he asked me to make him some of the food I was making and I just ignored him he kept asking till I said no make it yourself and he kept bugging me asking why I couldn\u2019t just make extra. Then I brought up his text message and said \u201cHaving a disability doesn\u2019t make you special, with or without it you\u2019re lazy.\u201d I put my airpods in and just ignored anything else he said and he walked away. \n\nMy grandma just called and I guess he told her what I said and she told me what I said was rude and uncalled for and that he deserves more credit than that despite all the things he says. My dad is on my side and said he was glad I said something but I do feel a little guilty. AITA?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t not realize Asperger\u2019s is an outdated term, thank you to those who let me know. Changed it to ASD.\n\nEdit again: Obviously I\u2019m not very educated on terms about autism, ASD is the same thing, changed it again.", "created_utc": 1692898625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1608msn/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_having_a/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stand up for yourself. If your dad is \"glad you said something\" maybe he should also be a responsible parent and say something to your brother??", "NTA. I absolutely agree with you. Unless your brother is severely autistic and unable to function, he\u2019s simply using his diagnosis as a reason for not putting in extra effort. Your brother needs to learn that you only get what you work for and unfortunately some people need to work harder than others to get what they want. This has always been true, now we just have a diagnosis to explain why.", "NTA\n\nAs your dad says, your older brother is using his disability as a crutch.  You can have Asperger\u2019s and a job.  You can have Asperger\u2019s and have a good life.  He's choosing to sit on his rear and smoke weed, lashing out when he can.  Good for you to not make him a meal.  When's the last time he made YOU a meal?  Or anyone else, hmm?", "NTA\n\nI have an older sister who had a brain injury from how she came into the world. It wasn't apparent until she was school-aged and then the family focus shifted to her. She hated it; the new \"special\" words, the coddling, the extra attention, and the lies she was told to \"protect\" her self-esteem. \n\n The point I guess I'm making is I haven't experienced your situation but I actually have. \n\n1. Your brother wants extra consideration and attention for his autism. (Never dealt with that)\n2. He's older than you and yet, you are expected to be responsible for his feelings and be mindful to not overshadow him while trying to live your own life. (Yeah, every day.) Parents who go overboard for one kid and leave another one behind are helping neither child.\n\nYou are walking a tightrope. Keep being an advocate for yourself. It isn't AH behavior to say No when you feel the need to say it.", "NTA. Siblings fight.  He was mean; you were mean; you will both hopefully grow up and move on.", "Okay, so maybe take this with a grain of salt, because this is a sibling fight and sibling fights have different boundaries sometimes but I think this is actually a situation where both of you kinda suck. Like, ESH (Everyone sucks here). What your brother said, especially bringing you into it? Asshole thing to say. Your grandmother and father bringing you up as a comparison? Asshole thing to do. But making the \"having a disability doesn't make you special\" jab was unnecessary because it's an ableist thing to say and you don't want to be saying ableist shit, even if your brother started it by putting you down.\n\nI don't know about your brother \"deserving more credit\", but I do know it's absurd for your grandmother to call you out for being rude to him when he started it by bringing you down in a *groupchat.* And your dad is a hypocrite for saying he's on your side when it seems like he didn't do anything about, again, your brother bringing you down in that groupchat. \n\nYou should speak up for yourself, make no mistake. Your brother shouldn't be bringing you into those conversations like that. But your grandmother and your father shouldn't either and they should stick up for you if he does, no hesitation. I think what you said was kinda shitty but it was also understandable. So maybe err on the side of being a little more careful *not* to say ableist shit to your brother but also feel free to be mad as hell because your family shouldn't be dragging you into that stuff.", "NTA I don't see why having ADHD or Aspergers prevents him from having a basic job. He doesn't want a boss? hahahahhahahaaahahaahahaha. That's funny like he thinks other people love having a boss. Sounds like his issue is more that he needs to get over himself.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Seems like he\u2019s expecting special treatment from everyone around him because of his autism, which obviously isn\u2019t severe and he\u2019s able to function.", "The Hmm in your comment made me think of that dog that talks with buttons, and the question is hmm at the end...HAHA.\n\nAnyway, NTA, good for you standing up for yourself.  Your brother is lazy and there is no reason he can't be productive with his conditions. He has too much pride to listen to others is his bigger problem.", "NTA.  Having a disability does not give you the right to insult other ppl.", "NTA. Having a disability does mean things are harder, but not that you get to blame other people for not being disabled. He can be mad at systemic ableism all he wants (cause fuck that shit), but he doesn't get to be bad at YOU because you did better than him. \n\nAlso, ADHD and autism (aspergers is an outdated name for low support needs autism) are highly genetic so not only does that mean one or both of your parents likely have them, you likely do as well. Women are extremely underdiagnosed with both ADHD and autism.", "NTA but also just general fyi Asperger\u2019s hasn\u2019t been an official diagnosis in the DSM-5 since 2013 and the ICD11 since 2019, it\u2019s included in the autism spectrum and a lot of neurodivergent people find that the term distasteful because of its history and division of autistic people into \u201chigh functioning\u201d and \u201clow functioning \u201c", "I feel like I\u2019m gonna get downvoted to hell but NAH. \n\nOf course it\u2019s your right to stand up for yourself, and what your brother said was wrong. But It can be extremely difficult for people to grow up with these disabilities while having a bad relationship with their parents AND be constantly compared to their (more \u201csuccessful\u201d abled sibling. Your brother attacked and put you down because you are being idealized while he is being put down. \n\nThe real AH are your parents for fostering a competitive environment that pits you against each other. I would suggest you have a conversation with them about never using you as an example with them again (and to generally stop comparisons with your brothers) And try to find a way to slowly rebuild your relationship with them outside of your parents. Good luck.", "grandma needs to butt the fuck out. this is real life. he Doesn't get a participation trophy just for existing. NTA", "ESH, but you are a teenager so I guess that is to be expected", "NTA ask him since when being a lazy AH is a disability.", "I was about to comment with the same thing. OP, not only are you NTA, but given that both of your brothers are on the autism spectrum and have ADHD, it\u2019s very likely that you might have one of those as well.\n\nIf it\u2019s possible at all, you may want to ask your parents if they could have you evaluated for ADHD and autism just in case - a lot of times teachers and doctors miss the symptoms in girls because the stereotype is that both ADHD and autism are boy things.", "I apologize I didn\u2019t know this", "I agree, I would also add that if someone else brought up OP, was he supposed to say nothing? If I tell my mom \u201cyou treat my sister/brother differently in X, Y, and Z ways. You don\u2019t take A and B things into consideration with me, here are examples of what I believe to be distinctly different treatment that is unacceptable.\u201d I am not *actually* talking about my brother or sister. I am talking about treatment from my parents, and an argument occurring between me and my parents. Are siblings never allowed to bring up disparities in relationships without it being about the sibling being mentioned? In which case, OPs discussion of her parents treatment of her brothers in this very post is somehow talking badly about him. I don\u2019t know, a part of me wants to say, \u201cif your sibling is discussing something with your parents about their treatment and you are mentioned, making it about you is an AH move.\u201d Since OPs brother was unnecessarily mean, I\u2019d say ESH.", "Mh! You have a good point! I think it's totally fair to bring up things like that but that should be a *private conversation.* These are things OP is repeatedly hearing brought up in public arguments and then OP's brother brings it up in a groupchat not just to say \"hey you're unfairly comparing us\" but to say \"hey actually OP kinda sucks so why're you bothering me\" which, especially in a groupchat, and considering OP wasn't even involved in this discussion, is wild as hell. Y'know? \n\nLike, you're right, siblings should be able to bring up stuff like that but also, there's a time and a place, I think.", "You\u2019re right, OPs brother should\u2019ve discussed it with them outside of the family group chat. He shouldn\u2019t have belittled OP. He sucks for that. OP still didn\u2019t have to return fire though. I would\u2019ve too though. Maybe. I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019ll amend that to say: at 20 or 17 I probably would\u2019ve haha. Now I probably wouldn\u2019t. I would take it to not be about me, and more about them, but I understand both of their frustration.", "Definitely! Now, OP is 17. Brother is *20.* Even without the age gap, if one of my siblings had tried to bring me down on a family group chat in a fight I wasn't even involved in (;\\_;) and then tried to get me to make food for them without even trying to apologize, I know I would've roasted their ass. Without the ableism, obviously, but I definitely feel like especially since OP has no one sticking up for them, I feel like returning fire was justified ngl. \n\nI feel bad that OP's (if you're reading this OP, I don't mean to be rude, this is just the dynamic I noticed) grandma and father are creating this hostile dynamic between OP and their brother by comparing them. That's unfair and can have lasting consequences, so it's very hard.

A big one.\n\nPersonally I think he should go and live with your grandmother seeing as he went whining to her..  living with her and experiencing what you guys all do might be eye opening for her.\n\nAnd seeing as you have two brothers that are neurodiverse... there's a possibility that you too may get diagnosed in the future but your presentation is different and you mask better.  That will really put a dent in the sails of that brother.", "NTA I have adhd and had all A\u2019s and b\u2019s throughout school all the way up to my masters with almost no studying because I was undiagnosed and couldn\u2019t pay attention.

It is possible you have it and it presents very differently in girls and boys. I had to wait until my late 20s to get diagnosed.

Depending on where you are, it could be hella easier to get tested before you turn 18. And it'd be nice to throw it in their faces, but I'm petty like that. Also, even if you have AuDHD, y'all are still different people! I don't understand people's need to compare people."]}
