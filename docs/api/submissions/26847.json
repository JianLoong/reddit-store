She has been nasty to Lindsey since so no relationship on that part.\n\nWe were driving today and Bethany went on a rant about Lindsey. She looked at her Snapchat story and saw she got into a sorority, Bethany tried to get into one and it didn\u2019t work out.  After five minutes I had enough and told her she is jealous and bitter towards Lindsey and she won\u2019t stop until she gets her own life and stop watching Lindsey\u2019s life so closely.

Why don't you try to be an understanding parent and help her work through it rather than call her names?", "NTA\n\nThis is all on Bethany. She needs to learn that \"comparison is the thief of happiness.\"\n\nShe needs to focus on her own life and goals and not worry if others are accomplishing what she can't. Therapy might really help her. Her college likely offers free sessions.", "NTA, but you need to understand something. In the two years that Lindsey has joined your family, she has gone past Bethany's records/aims at least three times. She now probably feels outdone. Her jealousy is not ideal, but it is quite natural. She called you names for 'picking Lindsey's side. I would say she feels replaced from her position as a daughter and thinks you now prefer her step-sister over her.\n\nYou say you have spoken to her about it. That is good. However maybe, after everyone has calmed down, you can talk to her again, or offer to get her some help regarding self esteem issues?", "INFO: Why does your daughter feel the need to compare herself to Lindsey?", "I'm a little bothered by how you talk to your daughter. Yes her jealousy is misplaced but calling her names isn't going to make it better. Your daughter clearly needs help.", "Bethany is N T A for feeling jealous (I had a younger sister that I was really jealous of growing up but at least we cultivated separate interests. Also we grew up together!

And you weren\u2019t wrong in what you said. But maybe it could\u2019ve been expressed better\u2026 \n\nBased on your comments, it sounds like you\u2019ve tried to communicate with her in kinder terms and the interaction in question was likely out of frustration that Bethany persists in focusing on comparisons instead of on herself. \n\nInstead of just trying to encourage her to do other things, or to snap at her for not doing other things, what about: \n\n\u201cBethany, I\u2019m sorry I snapped at you the other day, and made you feel like I was taking Lindsey\u2019s side. You are my priority, and it\u2019s really difficult for me to see you unhappy and disappointed, and it feels to me like this jealousy is causing you a lot of distress but that you aren\u2019t taking active steps to work on it. And I got frustrated about it. I love you and want you to feel proud of your strengths and accomplishments! I want you to be able to talk to me, but I need those conversations to be more productive moving forward. I want to get us into counseling to figure out how we can communicate better and support your happiness and fulfillment.

How did OP treat Lindsey when she came into Bethany\u2019s life? Bethany was accustomed to being OP\u2019s focus and that shifted. Did OP address that or tell her to get over it? We don\u2019t know. Unless Bethany is, by nature, a jealous person, there\u2019s more to this story. Admittedly, OP \u201chad enough\u201d and told her she\u2019s bitter and jealous and needs to get her own life.

This, your response to her emotions and jealousy, makes your daughter feel like you are picking a side, and it's not hers.\nWhile it is very true that being jealous and comparing yourself to others will bring her sadness and no happiness, jealousy ITSELF is a very natural emotion and should be dealt with compassion, especially from her dad. Maybe next time, try to listen to her pain, and tell her that you understand that it's hard to feel lesser than a (step)sister. And then after that, yeah sure, look into other things like helping her find smth new she could shine in, not feeling like living in a shadow from anyone. I get that she's an adult, but lots of adults and parents just shame the emotion of jealousy and ship it away like it's a bad characteristic, while it's actually a very human emotion and shouldn't be cast away like that.

I feel like the y-t-a are acting like this is one where the mom heavily favors the stepdaughter. Even OPs comments seem like the girls just genuinely are similar with their interests and hobbies. Theres mot much OP can do to help Bethany outside of telling her to stop focusing on lindseys accomplishments so much and pointing out the jealousy.\n\nIts not on OP to blindly support her daughters hatred for her stepdaughter. at this point OP is not \u2018taking sides\u2019 but if they allow Bethany to badmouth lindsey over and over she would be. Especially when shes saying she hopes lindsey gets pregnant and ruins her life type of stuff. Its just too far and OP was right to shut that shit down.  Bethany isnt a freshly 18 year old barely adult whos fresh to the world, shes a 21 year old adult who needs to stop being obsessed with what her step sister is doing. \n\nIf she wants more time with OP, she can be an adult and say that. If she wants attention, she can tell OP that.

Bethany is obviously jealous and fighting for your attention. Family therapy might help?", "It seems like she thinks you\u2019ve replaced her with a younger, better daughter. This requires empathy, not telling her she\u2019s jealous and bitter.

You are justified in your frustration with her rants, but it's part of your job as a parent to *help* her find a more positive direction to take. And Lindsey is justified in doing her best in whatever she wants to do, but she could perhaps take a second look on some of her choices and maybe *not* compete with Bethany on things that are important to Bethany, but not so important to Lindsey (ex. maybe choose to run in a different 5k, not the same one Bethany was competing in).\n\nYOUR job now is to help Bethany figure out the places where she can shine over and above Lindsey and be sure to praise her for those things. Don't be insincere - that's worse than not saying anything at all. But take a long hard look at Bethany's good qualities and where she excels, then make a point (at appropriate times) of telling her how proud of her you are for those things.", "NTA. She needs to work through her jealousy & get her own things to focus on. It sounds like you\u2019ve tried to help her start new things in her life, but she can\u2019t get past her stepsisters successes.

You\u2019re in a tough spot because I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to badmouth your stepdaughter but also need to be somewhat sensitive to your daughters feelings if you\u2019re going to help her move past it. Jealousy isn\u2019t a great look on anyone.", "NTA. While Bethany needs some help, she also is actively saying horrible things about her step sister.

I would be shocked if that ever happens.\n\nOne of my coworkers (a female teacher) came up to me (a male teacher) and asked me this:\n\nShe said that when two of her boys got into an argument/fight, 10 minutes later they were playing together.  But when two of girls got into an argument/fight, it went on for days, their friends all took sides and sometimes their mothers got in on it.\n\nShe asked me why I thought that was.\n\nI declined to offer any opinion.  I'm no fool.", "Info: Do you pay attention to Lindsey more than Bethany? Because some parents will praise and give more attention to the kid that succeeds more in things, so the other one ends up feeling left out and abandoned, which causes resentment.\n\nNo judgement from me since I don't know what happened behind closed doors.", "Oof. NTA, but damn if I don\u2019t sympathize with your daughter. My life was in a rut and when I looked at my friends, they all had good jobs, went to college, were in long-term relationships. I was bitter. Perhaps not to the point Bethany is, but shoot. It sucks when someone is living the life you crave so much. \n\nPer one of your replies, I\u2019m glad you shut it down when she implied her step-sister would get pregnant. All I can say is to talk to her when she calms down a bit. Make her understand you\u2019ll always be in her corner, but she can\u2019t tear others down just because she\u2019s hit some speed bumps. Is she in therapy, by chance? She could probably benefit greatly from it. Also see if she can go to her college resource center and try to find a new direction. Be it a new major, new job path, new sport, etc. \n\nHope she starts coming around. It really sucks. From this random woman on the internet: Bethany, I\u2019m rooting for you. I hope things get better, love.", "Even though daughter doesn\u2019t agree to therapy OP needs to find a way to convince her. She will spend years wasting time being jealous comparing to her sister. What\u2019s next, boyfriends, who gets engaged first/married/pregnant? She needs to hear from someone on the outside and dad can be supportive in the meantime", "NTA This may be one of those times where you have to let your daughter figure it out herself.  Lindsey has done nothing wrong and until Brittany faces the fact that there are people in her life that will exceed at things she doesn't, she will continue on this course.  You can ask her if she does things better than some of her friends and do they treat her like crap because of it.  \n\nAlso, she needs to be in therapy.  She is not a teenager any longer and this behavior needs to be addressed.  Whenever she brings it up, tell her calmly that you will no longer discuss the subject and she needs to be in therapy.", "NTA but yeah, instead of focusing of what she has, she's looking at what other people/person has.\n\nenvy is the only one of the 7 deadly sins that is no fun at all.", "NTA", "NTA. It's a bitter pill but one she needs to swallow nonetheless. Once she gets a life that she is happy with, she won't be as jealous of her stepsister.", "NTA - it's good parenting in my opinion. \n\nBut for the record, my response to her accusing you of taking Lindsey's side would have been something like:\n\n\"No, I'm taking your side by telling you about it. If I was taking Lindsey's side, I wouldn't say anything. I would have let you continue to embarrass yourself and live your life full of hatred. If I was on Lindsey's side, I would have just sat back and continued to watch you ruin a great start to your life for no real reason at all other than you can't handle someone else being successful.\n\nI'm on your side. I want you to be better. \"", "This is life. Not everything will go our way. Most important lesson that Bethany needs to learn imo is that she will be defined by how she responds to failure far more than any of her successes. Character building always sucks and is often painful, but she has an opportunity here she can\u2019t see yet. For the first time in her life she has had her hopes and dreams crushed. This happens to all of us, but it\u2019s happening for her right as she\u2019s beginning, so she doesn\u2019t have the tools or wisdom to handle it yet. Bethany will learn that there will always be people who are more successful than her, who will have achieved things she can\u2019t. Right now her disappointment is being expressed in anger at Lindsey, and she\u2019s doing that to avoid hating and blaming herself more than she already does. \n\nOP, instead of telling her to focus on herself, try to work with her on how to deal with failure. That\u2019s what this is really about. I would advise Bethany to stop following Lindsey\u2019s social media, because it\u2019s triggering for her. That\u2019s not Lindsey\u2019s fault at all, she\u2019s clearly just going on living her own life, but Bethany is comparing herself to her way too much. Not hearing about Lindsey living the life she wished she had will help her focus on her own. When Bethany starts to go in about Lindsey, redirect and ask her what she intends to do.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not enough to say \u2018don\u2019t be jealous\u2019. That\u2019s an abstract and doesn\u2019t teach how Bethany can deal with her feelings. Like yes, she needs to stop comparing herself to others and focus on herself, but telling her that doesn\u2019t tell her *how* to do that. I think that may be what you\u2019re missing here. One way you can help her is to talk about your own failures, or the failures of people she admires and how they overcame them. Bethany may benefit on learning that other people\u2019s lives aren\u2019t a straight uphill trajectory, that how we respond when we have failed is what defines a successful person. \n\nLong story short. Bethany needs compassion, but she\u2019s asking others to enable her rage because that feels like people are on her side, but it\u2019s misdirected. But\u2026 also at her age if she won\u2019t listen to advice, she may have to have life try to teach her instead. Sometimes the hard way is the only way some people learn.", "Yes, you are the asshole.", "YTA\n\nShe is jealous because she has low self-worth and major insecurity. Telling someone to 'get a life' is not the solution there. **Bethany genuinely thinks Lindsey is better than her**, **and she feels profoundly ashamed of that**. Help her let go of the idea that Lindsey is better than her, and define her own goals. \n\nIn my family, I was the Lindsey for a long while. I hit some milestones before my older brother and he hated me for it. His nastiness to me was next level and my parents just yelled at him for it, never asking what was going on with him. Now that I look back I recognize that he was terribly behaved because he was miserable and my parents mismanaged the situation by never getting him help.", "\"Also yes I have had this conversation multiple times before with her and her jealously.

Give her some reassurance.", "YTA- glad ur not my mom!! Wow.", "As a parent, it's your job to teach your children the emotional skills they need. \n\nNot just complain that they don't have them.\n\nAsk yourself if Bethany learned to complain about her family relationships from you.", "YTA. I read things like this and I can not fathom it being real. You daughter is 21 years old and I will take a guess that you are in your 40s and you have no idea how to properly communicate with your child after all this time even if she is in the wrong. \u201cYou are bitter and jealous and it will not stop until you get a life of your own.\u201d I am sorry but who speaks to their child like that and than ask if they are an asshole. Six years is not a long time in the grand scheme of things and meeting her at 15, how long has this been going on? What part have you played in garnishing a healthy relationship? Just stating that she is her sister even though they have only been in each others life for six years. I feel like a lot of things have been left unsaid on your part which would make you more of an asshole. \nI will not at all be surprised in time if your next post is something along the lines of AITA \u2026 My daughter doesn\u2019t speak to me anymore. In that case you will probably still be the asshole.", "YTA bud. Emotions, even the negative ones, are *okay to feel*. That's the first step to processing them in a healthy way.", "YTA.\n\nDo you know that you chose Lindsey over Bethany? It seems pretty obvious that you chose which daughter you wanted and have left the other to fend for herself. It is no surprise that she is jealous of the daughter her father chose over her. Especially when she feels like everyone else in her world chooses her stepsister and she can't even count on her own father to support her.", "NTA. But I think this train of thought of having to be better than/compete with others is not healthy. Maybe Bethany needs therapy and to work on her self confidence.", "Personally I'm going to go with yes, YTA.   \n\n\nUnlike many of the commenters, I actually think 21 is a very, very young age where people say and do a looott of things they should not do. Her emotions of jealousy are also extremely normal considering the situations you described. It's pretty clear that Bethany is insecure & projecting these insecurities onto Lindsey, and her behavior is 100% unacceptable if she's treating her that way too. However, your own mother shouldn't be calling you bitter & jealous. As a now 23 y/o female who has struggled with jealousy issues in the past, my mom saying that about me might have completely crushed my self esteem and validated my inner thoughts/feelings that this other girl was better than me & even my own MOM wasn't on my side.   \n\n\nI would try a different approach & show your daughter that she is special in her own way and that comparing herself to Lindsey (or anyone else, for that matter) is really unhealthy.

Come back and let us know if you ever get to see any children she has.", "YTA", "YTA. It's not even about picking a side, it's about guiding your daughter and by saying she's jealous you are confirming that Lindsey is better than Bethany at the things she wanted to be better at. Maybe try to refocus Bethany. When she makes a jealous comment, shift the conversation to something Bethany excels at. Try to guide her to a different path to Lindsey and help her find her strengths and then show her how proud you are of her.

But when does competition become ugliness to someone who wasn\u2019t used to losing like that. Not saying losing isn\u2019t bad, but damn, over and over. I mean, to your new stepsister whose younger than you no less. That\u2019s bound to breed resentment. You no longer have autonomy. There\u2019s idolization and then there\u2019s someone who just wants to BE that person and unfortunately that person gets lost.

When raising children, the merging of two families and the balancing of parental love can bring about a myriad of emotions.\r  \n\r  \nBethany, while a young adult, is still navigating her place in the world. To her, it may feel as though Lindsey is living a life she once dreamed of or, perhaps, even better. This can, undoubtedly, stir feelings of insecurity or inadequacy in Bethany, leading her to perceive every achievement of Lindsey's as a slight against her own worth. The race of life, for Bethany, might seem like one she's losing, and so she feels the need to voice out her frustrations, however misplaced they may be.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, it's important to remember that while Bethany's feelings of jealousy and inadequacy are real to her, they aren't always a reflection of reality. Every individual's journey is unique, with its own challenges and triumphs. Lindsey's achievements do not diminish Bethany's worth or her own accomplishments.\r  \n\r  \nYour role as a parent is challenging, as you need to support both daughters, fostering a harmonious relationship while also helping Bethany come to terms with her feelings. Sometimes, the feelings of jealousy and competition need to be addressed not with direct confrontation, but with understanding and gentle guidance.\r  \n\r  \nIt might be worthwhile to sit Bethany down in a calm moment and listen to her, truly listen, without judgment or interruptions. Let her express her feelings, her fears, and her insecurities. Once she feels heard, gently remind her of her own worth, her own journey, and the fact that life isn't a race against others but a journey with oneself. Encourage her to find value in her own path, rather than constantly comparing it to someone else's.\r  \n\r  \nIt's also essential to reinforce that family is about support and love, not competition. Building a bond between Bethany and Lindsey will take time and patience, and perhaps even external guidance or counseling.\r  \n\r  \nAnd remember, my dear, parenting, especially in blended families, is a journey that doesn't come with a manual. There will be bumps along the way, but with understanding, patience, and love, the road can become smoother.

I think being more supportive of her and helping her celebrate the accomplishments she is proud of and the things she has succeeded at might help her feel less jealous of what Lindsey has done.

Also she\u2019s 21 not 12 so I think she can take a harsh word of truth being a grown up and all. \n\nBut yes after the shutdown there has to be some conversation about why she feels that way and what could possibly be done to improve how she feels so she\u2019s not behaving so badly and feeling so terrible.", "Agree with this entirely.

Lindsey would probably be smart to limit Bethany's access to her social media and avoid talking about her life, especially accomplishments, when she's around.\n\nIt looks like OP has his hands full with this one. Any intervention (with respect to Bethany's toxic pattern of behaviour) that would have been effective should have been applied long before Bethany turned 18.

It sounds like Bethany is super insecure about her own plans/goals not working out and she\u2019s projecting those insecurities onto Lindsay. And that last comment is absolutely vile and tells me that Bethany is seriously lacking in compassion toward Lindsay. \n\nThis might seem odd, but I actually think Bethany would benefit from practicing self-compassion. If my guess is accurate, she seems to base her self worth on external factors (eg what colleges she got into, how many races she won, etc). Basing one\u2019s self worth on external factors makes for a highly unstable self image and it can make people more prone to depression, body image issues, substance abuse, and even suicidality. But self-compassion teaches us to intrinsically value ourselves so that our self worth isn\u2019t contingent on any external factors. So even when we \u201cfail\u201d, we still have high self-worth because we recognize that our worth was never dependent on success - we are worthy of love simply because we\u2019re human. \n\nAnother great thing about practicing self-compassion is that it also increases compassion for *others*. So my hope is that in practicing self-compassion, Bethany will improve her own self worth  and will also develop a greater capacity for compassion for her sister. \n\nAnyway if you think self-compassion might help Bethany, I highly recommend checking out self-compassion.org - there\u2019s a ton of info and some practices/exercises that Bethany can try to improve her self-compassion. Once things have cooled down a bit, you could try suggesting it to her (she probably won\u2019t be open to suggestions from you right now so I wouldn\u2019t try too soon)\n\nEdit: added \u201ctoward Lindsay\u201d for specificity.", "She's comparing herself constantly and feels she has the short end of the deal everytime.

If not, it can be difficult to appreciate the mental stress and long lasting insecurity that can come from not receiving a bid after going through rush, which is what it sounds like happened to your daughter.

Each potential new member met approximately 100-150 women over the course of a week and the ones who didn\u2019t receive a bid had to cope with the fact that none of those women liked them enough to want them in their house.

She clearly feels completely inadequate and needs some guidance in internalizing her self worth.\n\nETA:  Just to be clear, what she said was fucked up.  Incredibly.  I just think OP should look deeper at where that kind of wild resentment is coming from.", "\u201cEqual with both kids\u201d \u2026 obviously your bio daughter needs more right now. The step has her parent to support her.", "I know it\u2019s not my comment you\u2019re asking about, but I was like this as a teenager so I feel somewhat qualified to give my perspective.\n\nI was *mean as Hell* when I was younger. Not a bully or anything, just kind of a jerk. And there was this girl in my graduating class who was\u2026 not very bright. I never said anything to her face but I privately talked some mad shit about her the entire time we were in high school.\n\nWe had an art class together senior year, and she asked me to help her with an assignment, since I was a competent artist. As I was working with her, I realized that she was a very sweet person and that I\u2019d been a complete asshole. She talked to me like we\u2019d been friends our entire lives. I left that class feeling like the worst person on Earth, and when I got home I reflected on my past behavior and realized that I didn\u2019t like who I was and I needed to change.\n\nI still slip up sometimes, I\u2019m still only human, but it\u2019s very possible to just\u2026 decide to be better and take those steps.\n\nOP is NTA, for sure. Her daughter needed to hear that, no matter how bad it hurts.", "Understood.

Everyone can see how you always use your cat to manipulate people into thinking you're the victim! I can't believe after all these years you are still bringing up the same things.

Can be done in person or online.  www.rebootrecovery.com", "I may not be the smartest person in the room but when you really start reading his comments something is not adding up. The daughter could be acting like an asshole but I would also believe that some of her jealousy stems from being the black sheep in his new perfect family. I know it\u2019s possible but it just so happens that her stepsister is better than her at everything but the stepsister isn\u2019t competing with her. All of his comments have something written between the lines. He also avoids answering any question that puts any blame on the stepdaughter or makes his daughter look any better.", "The narcissistic behavior has obviously been parentified, and the request for assistance is obviously a symptom of deeper problems that require payment and therapy. The cat says so.", "Bless you.", "Yup!", "Freakin thank you!!"]}
