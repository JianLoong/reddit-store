Your SIL was the one being dishonest, and it just caught up with her.

She was dating two men that are friends with each other (and with you)!  How else was this going to turn out?  Her blaming you is only because she doesn't want to admit she messed up.  I can see it, at your wedding, they all wanted her to be the plus one.

Wtf are you talking about?", "Ok, I think we are miscommunicating here. I didn't went out my way to prove a point, I was just talking with my friend. I knew one of them was going out with her, but not the other.\n\nWhat happened was a coincidence. I never thought she was cheating, never occured to me that this was happening.\n\nAnd I'm not going to discuss personal opinions about cheating, is a waste of both our times.", "You made that clear OP, and no one else in the comments seems to be confused.\n\nu/lekitniki seems to be making up their own story", "Funny. You seem to be very open about other people's cheating.\n\nCheating is not great, but, people can learn from their mistakes. A serial cheater and a cheater who learns, two different things.\n\nIf somebody chooses to feel remorse over their cheating, admits their wrong and learns from their mistake, accepting that it will never happen again, the past itself does not matter.\n\nIt's simply that, the past.", "Yeah you're not even reading what OP is writing at this point, you just completely ignored everything they said in the comment you replied to.\n\n\nDoing ok, pal? There's already others assuming you're projecting.", "Lady, since you aren't reading what I'm writing, and I'm not gonna discuss personal opinions. I just wish you can get through what you're going right now.", "What people say and do, two very different things.\n\nI'm great. I'm just a critical thinker and more direct than most.\n\nHow are you? Please don't call me pal, I think we both know you're doing it to be condescending. I don't appreciate it.\n\nEveryone 'projects' otherwise we simply wouldn't be talking.\n\nI'm just louder in text than most.\n\nYes, I've absolutely been cheated on by someone who didn't recognize their own problems as problems.\n\nWhy do you feel that's your business?", "Bold assumption that I'm a 'Lady'.\n\nI am reading what you're writing, but what you're saying isn't the whole truth. Simple as that. It's fine, I get it, I've been there myself.\n\nYou're making your own opinion on cheating very clear. That's fine, we can move on.\n\nI'm 'through' my own stuff thanks, 'healed' of my own trauma. Why do you assume I'm not?", "Cause you're trying really hard to make a point that isn't necessary.\n\nSo, it's one of three things: you're either bored out of your mind and decided to come trolling. You're projecting since you either cheated or experienced something like it. Or you are just one crazy person who has access to the Internet.\n\nSince your Karma is negative from comments, I'm going with the first option, Regis."]}
