Regardless of what you've done for her or not in the past (which is very kind of you BTW).  Regardless of what you should do going forward (which I agree, she's very irresponsible and her irresponsibility shouldn't be your burden).  You went off on a pregnant women. \n\nShe isn't that dumb.  She knows she messed up.  She knows she's screwed financially.  I'm afraid you let your emotions get the best of you.  Like it or not, you failed to be impartial and supportive because you have skin in the game.  \n\nSure, she's dumb and immature.  She has problems.

Where is their father in all of this? What is your line of work? Because there are many ways to support yourself without a degree & some people don't drop out when they get pregnant. Some schools offer work study where you can get paid. Some students have their baby, take a semester off, then go back. Abby doesn't have to be a waitress & she doesn't have to go back to school. These are decisions y'all made. \n\nIt seems to me the daughter who doesn't 'have her shit together' is following in your footsteps with 2 kids...& the daughter who told you to post here reaps the benefits of Abby's mistakes.\n\nIMO you didn't prepare Abby for college & she got pregnant. Then you somehow both decided she was ready for college again & she got pregnant again. Now you blame her for the trajectory her life has taken even though you appear to be an enabler of said life by 'raising' your grandchild. When she first got pregnant at 19 you should have explicitly stated you won't accept this behavior from her again ie if you get pregnant again you will be on your own. \n\nBut ofc hindsight is always 20/20. \n\nWhen did y'all have the conversation that she would not have another child? Or the convo that baby number 1 meant she 'screwed up' her life? \n\nI think YTA because your daughter isn't a mind reader & technically had a teen pregnancy - as her mother, what did you explicitly do to make sure she wouldn't end up pregnant again? Where is that part of the story?", "No, you're good.  :)  \n\nI do like you putting conditions on her staying with you.  Yes.  Good.  Her having rules to live by like staying in school is healthy because she will have successes and be encouraged and grow in her ability to be an adult and to even parent.  We want her to be encouraged.  We want her to know that she can do what she puts her mind to and you helping is wonderful.\n\nWhat about charging her a small rent and saving that money for her without telling her?  \n\nI would hate to see her without you because she would be more likely to take up with somebody that isn't good for because she would be struggling so hard.   Having said that, the arrangement has to be real for her and for you so that it is adhered to.\n\nWouldn't you need to babysit as much as she is in class?  I pray she will get serious and take motherhood and her education seriously.  By education I mean either a formal education or anything she puts her mind to.  If she wants to socialize she could study at home to be a realtor and take the tests and get in with a broker - or any other idea.  Probably faster than a formal education.   Based on her past I'm thinking having an employer might be better suited to her personality.  \n\nNot sure about child support.  Only if you want the fathers in their life.  Are they a good influence?  If they are already in the child's life then yes of course but don't just try to get as much money as you can.  Just what is reasonable.  I have seen so many men's lives ruined with them living in a room of a house or in a trailer because the state makes many many small deductions from the paycheck because the state knows that they are leaving the men in poverty.   \n\nIn my opinion, women that leave (LEAVE) a provider shouldn't be awarded more than the provider could have provided if they had stayed with the provider.   That is a disaster.", "And? She can travel to a state that allows it. I'm sure OP would even offer to pay for it.
