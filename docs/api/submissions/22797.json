You should not be responsible for raising her children.\n\nIf you want to go the tough love route, you can evict her and force her to be an adult.  She is 24, she can manage.

While it\u2019s all good and dandy that she has OP\u2019s support raising her kids , she needs to start being responsible. It\u2019s not far fetched to understand OP\u2019s frustration. The fact that OP is going to once again have to step In because daughter wants to quit makes this a family decision on what happens going forward . She can\u2019t want to make her decisions and everyone needs to just deal . You want family support , your decisions become family decisions. OP\u2019s response was just fine", "NTA.

But Abby has completely disregarded your sacrifice of time and money for her own pleasure.  You were kind to merely tell Abby to get it together.  Others would have let her know the gravy train has come to an end.   You\u2019ve done more for Abby than Bethany, because it was understood Abby needed the extra help.

Sometimes tough love is justified, especially when she's relying upon your kindness. \n\nShe honestly needs to get her shit together, condoms/birth control/the plethora of contraceptives available aren't hard to use. & if used properly are very effective.

You can stop helping... whoch would mean one of you daughters has to drop out and cannot work anymore becuase of 2 small children and a assume 0 support from hte fathers... or you help her. Under the condition that she finishes college. no matter what. You can apply for one free semetser so to say in heavy cases. A birth probably fits in there. \n\nYou are sadly between a rock and a hard place here...", "Eh, I think NAH. Emotional moment, and you were disappointed.

YTA. Not because you're concerned about her dropping out or worried that you're going to have to take care of another kid. Those are valid fears and You should probably have a conversation about how you're not going to do that again. \n\nHowever, when someone tells you the news that they're pregnant, your response should not be \"Are you fucking kidding me\". It is incredibly rude and immature. You can be happy and supportive for her and also let her know that she's going to have to get her crap together maybe... An hour later? A day later? Not at the literal time she tells you. What a horrible reaction. \n\nImagine remembering back to when you told your parents you were pregnant and that's what you get to remember about this pregnancy.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt needed to be said.", "NTA.

Its a fair expectation on the part of a parent (or from anyone really) that your daughter would have learned after the consequences of birth #1.", "INFO: This feels like a missing missing reasons post. Why did she drop out of college? What else is happening in her life to make her so unsteady? Are you as verbally abusive to her at all times as you are in this post? Was Bethany given more time and energy throughout her childhood as the golden child while Abby was expected to do the labor for little sister?\n\nTonally alone you seem like a pretty unsupportive, verbally abusive asshole here. Seems like you did help out with childcare, and if Abby is expecting to offload that onto you again that might warrant an E S H vote.

Do I think this post is written too succinctly and you come off worse than you are, yeah.", "NTA\n\nNow you need to set boundaries. Tell her if she drops out, she needs to support herself and her kids. Let her know your help is dependent on her helping herself- stay in and finish college, get on better birth control, be more involved in raising her own kids. She will keep depending on you if you let her. I know it is tough with girls, my BIL was walked all over by his because they knew he would always bail them out. And he did, until they were in their 30s. He finally quit and made them take care of themselves. They have.", "NTA.\n\nGuess you're going to have to raise three children now once Abby gives birth.", "No, NTA. I feel so sorry for grandparents who end up having to parent their grandchildren because their kids are so irresponsible. I'm sure that after raising two children, you'd like to kick back and relax a bit and just play grandpa occasionally. Maybe it's time to take a step back, explain to her that you won't be helping out anymore and let her figure things out on her own. I don't think you're really doing her any favours by being so hands on.", "NTA. Why is she going to drop out? She can take online classes. She's an adult and has to live with her choices.

I might be reading more into the post but it seems OP is over being the free babysitter to one and now soon to be two kids.  She's raised her kids and now raising the grands.

Pretty normal upbringing, she was a rebel kid but usually was harmless. \n\nUmmm I don\u2019t think I was verbally abusive for telling her to get her shit together, I didn\u2019t make fun of her or call her names. I wasn\u2019t even yelling  when I said that.\n\nAbby never really watch Bethany. I would say it was even time spent with both.

As long as you understand the consequences of that to your own child.", "Honestly, it doesn't seem to me like you're worried about having to raise not one child but three now since Abby can't get her act together.

It's just an unfortunate situation!", "I understand, I'm just saying that we literally don't know the circumstances of the conception. \n\nBecause of that I just think it's weird to assume she made the *decision* to have another child.

You'd think she'd learn first time.\n\nOP I'd be the same with nah your on your own this time. You tried to help and she was more focused on fun and sex. She does have two options but I'm guessing g she's decided the clinic isn't an option.\n\nWe try to help our kids but sometimes they just need to be left to sink or swim.  Be there for the inncocnet kids when she does eventually drown but leave her to her own choices.\nI had to do it to my own kid who blames everyone for his choices and his awful life.

Maybe she\u2019ll be hurt enough to not do it again \u2014 or better yet, not have this one.", "We literally do know the circumstances of conception, unless you're into that whole \"Zeus turned into a duck\" scenario.", "Again, I wouldn't choose to leave my child to fend for themselves.

When I say the circumstances of conception, I don't mean the *literal* action which caused it, I mean the surrounding setting. \n\nIs she on birth control? Did it fail if so? Did the guy wear a condom? Did it stay on the entire time? Did he poke a hole in it? Etc.\n\nAgain, I'm not assuming she is faultless. I'm just saying that it's weird to assume that she simply \"opened her legs unprotected\" and thus got pregnant. The topic deserves more thought and nuance than that.", "Condoms and contraception fail all the time. \n\nAnd there\u2019s ya know, another way i will not mention. \n\nSo no, we dont know.", "Fair\n\nBut do you think Abby would learn her lesson if you kept support her? Were she a good mother after all this? Idk maybe I'm to pessimistic.", "It depends on what you call support. And depends on the boundaries you set up.\n\nI'd continue to help if Abby stayed in school for instance. I'd make sure she had a place to live and there was food on the table.\n\nI wouldn't indulge any other hobbies for instance or wouldn't babysit more than what is necessary for the studies and stuff like that. It doesn't have to be all or nothing."]}
