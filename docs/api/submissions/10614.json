Maybe I shouldn\u2019t of said it but I said, \u201cwell thank god she did because that would mean you spent all that money for no reason.\u201d  \n\nMy sister looks at me confused and I told her, well your daughter has a lot advantages compared to my daughter considering Sarah has more money to dump into it then I do, Sarah\u2019s ex husband comes from a rich family with connections and with that, she gets a lot of money from alimony and child support from him, so I just stated that her daughter is a clear example of nepotism and how being rich gives you a head start in numerous things. For example my niece has a private tutor to help stay up on top of her homework so she won\u2019t get behind. Sarah has the funds to dump money into privates and extra classes. Sarah also has a nanny to make sure her daughter makes it to these classes. My daughter doesn\u2019t have any of these things. so I feel like it\u2019s a stretch to say my niece solely wins on just hard work when in reality like my niece has more resources to become good.  Which is totally fine, because hell If I were in Sarah\u2019s position old do everything in my power to set my kid up for success. but my issue is her making it seem my daughter solely doesn\u2019t win because she doesn\u2019t work hard which isn\u2019t the case.\n\nSo My sister took great offense to this and claimed her children aren\u2019t nepo babies and that I\u2019m just jealous because her daughter constantly beats my daughter and that I just need to accept that maybe my daughter isn\u2019t that good.  We haven\u2019t talked since our fight but some say I\u2019m wrong for claiming my niece didn\u2019t work hard which isn\u2019t what I was trying to say. But AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: should be more specific but my sisters ex husband owns a company that his clients are primarily celebrities, with that my sister is able to get into contact with certain choreographers or master classes because of these connections . That someone like me is NOT able to do. For example she gets private from people who choreographed with people like Shakira & JLO and Secondly I\u2019m not jealous of my niece I\u2019m proud of her as well, I\u2019m just saying she had certain advantages.", "created_utc": 1677069504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118x35y/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_her_kids_are_nepo/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your sister was a famous dancer who was able to get her child into a place that you couldn't BECAUSE she was a famous dancer, that would be a Nepo baby.   Just having money doesn't make her a Nepo baby, it makes her have advantages.   Your jealousy and envy of your sister is toxic and gross.  Grow up.  Petty jealousy isn't a good look on anyone.", "\"her daughter is a clear example of nepotism\"\n\nOP doesn't know what nepotism means.  \n\nHer daughter is a clear example of growing up with privileges that you can't afford, sure.  But that's not what nepotism means.\n\nAlso, YTA  This has been building for a while and you let it all out at once to ruin your sisters day.  This could have been handled better.\n\nPrivileged or not, you haven't shown that your sister is wrong with her claim that her daughter worked hard.", "YTA. You seem to be confused about what nepotism is. Nepotism would be that your niece got into a dance school owned by the ex husband\u2019s family. Having more resources does not equal nepotism. You sound bitter and jealous of your sister and you are taking it out on a child. Your sister is absolutely right. Take a look in the mirror and really think about whether this is the kind of person you want to be.", "YTA.   \nYou are saying that your niece has no ability or talent and only gets where she is because her mummy has money. The kid is EIGHT. This isn\u2019t Dance Mums or Teen Mums for heaven\u2019s sake!\n\nYes money makes that stuff easier for Sarah \u2026. Does your niece have three times as many lessons as your daughter? No? Then she\u2019s a better dance because SHE IS BETTER. Tutors do little more than babysit at this age unless they are learning disability qualified - you can help your daughter without paying for it and your daughter gets to keep up too.   \n\n\nI\u2019m sad for Sarah. She\u2019s taken the risk of having a mini moment of mummy pride, with family, who she should feel safe with\u2026 and you\u2019ve slapped her hard back.

Your daughter will absolutely pick up on it, assuming she hasn\u2019t already.

Unless your sister is also the competition judge, nepotism isn\u2019t part of this discussion.\n\nYou are also jealous of your sister and her wealth.\n\nAttacking an 8 year old girl to make yourself feel superior to your sister is a terrible thing to do, and you owe that little girl an apology.  There is no amount of money you can pay to become a good dancer - just like any other skill it takes hard work and practice to become good.\n\nYou also are teaching your own 8 year old daughter that it is okay for a person in power (the adult) to belittle a person without power (8 year old child).  That is not even close to okay, and you need to get your own jealousy in check and stop teaching your daughter to act that way.\n\nYou are also teaching your daughter that winning is the most important thing.  When it should be to enhance her enjoyment of dancing.", "YTA. None of the things listed will make her a better dancer.

And anyone who says that you either got it or not is not thinking. So you think that natural talent is all that is really needed? Example I was in gymnastics growing up but only could afford a little time at gym and no real expensive trainer. I had a friend who had a private gym AND an Olympic trainer...her ability, and I don't hate on her bout it, she worked hard but clearly the advantages she got eventually overshadowed any natural talent I had. I mean that's common sense.", "Nepotism. You say this word yet you don\u2019t know what it means.\n\nYTA. You sound salty af that your sister has more resources than you.

Your niece has had more and better opportunities than your daughter, but she\u2019s also put in the work to take advantage of those opportunities. It\u2019s not nepotism - her parents can simply afford to give her opportunities you can\u2019t afford to give to your daughter. Fair, no; but it\u2019s unfortunately reality. \n\nYour sisters comments (if you\u2019ve accurately described them) are condescending and she seems to want to rub your nose in it. Also saying \u2018maybe one day it will click for (your daughter)\u2019 is a pretty shitty thing to say to her niece when she knows the differences in your circumstances. So she\u2019s also an AH. \n\nIf you had simply responded by congratulating your niece, praising her efforts and hard work and said that you wish you could afford to give (your daughter) the same opportunities to nurture her talent - then I think you would not have been TA", "ESH. Your sister is an arsehole for condescendingly saying your daughter isn\u2019t good or doesn\u2019t work hard enough.\n\nYou are an arsehole for trying to create your own definition of the word nepotism.

So when I met them, I was a stranger looking in and observing them. My well off aunt's & uncles were able to brag how well their children& grand children were doing in comparison because in every which way they were able to provide extra care. While for the rest it didn't matter how hard the kids may study or how much effort they put in, they were always at a disadvantage because of socioeconomic differences. The rich families had maids so their kids only tasks were to wake up, go to school and study, get driven from place to place. The middle class families didn't have all that so the kids did chores, took the bus to school, meaning it ate away at their time for relaxing and studying.\n\nI know that snide remark from your sister rubs you the wrong way because it was towards your child. But be the better person. Tell your kid it's ok to not always be the best and that sometimes some people are lucky to born with certain skills, or things come more naturally to them.

It's obvious that u r jealous of Sarah's money and of her daughter beating urs. It's an unfair situation, but then we live in an unfair world.\nThis is my speculation, but i feel u r upset that sarah's daughter gets to live in the lap of luxury and also gets to beat ur daughter (am not downplaying her efforts), while ur daughter has neither.

Maybe I shouldn\u2019t of said it but I said, \u201cwell thank god she did because that would mean you spent all that money for no reason.\u201d  \n\nMy sister looks at me confused and I told her, well your daughter has a lot advantages compared to my daughter considering Sarah has more money to dump into it then I do, Sarah\u2019s ex husband comes from a rich family with connections and with that, she gets a lot of money from alimony and child support from him, so I just stated that her daughter is a clear example of nepotism and how being rich gives you a head start in numerous things. For example my niece has a private tutor to help stay up on top of her homework so she won\u2019t get behind. Sarah has the funds to dump money into privates and extra classes. Sarah also has a nanny to make sure her daughter makes it to these classes. My daughter doesn\u2019t have any of these things. so I feel like it\u2019s a stretch to say my niece solely wins on just hard work when in reality like my niece has more resources to become good.  Which is totally fine, because hell If I were in Sarah\u2019s position old do everything in my power to set my kid up for success. but my issue is her making it seem my daughter solely doesn\u2019t win because she doesn\u2019t work hard which isn\u2019t the case.\n\nSo My sister took great offense to this and claimed her children aren\u2019t nepo babies and that I\u2019m just jealous because her daughter constantly beats my daughter and that I just need to accept that maybe my daughter isn\u2019t that good.  We haven\u2019t talked since our fight but some say I\u2019m wrong for claiming my niece didn\u2019t work hard which isn\u2019t what I was trying to say. But AITA in this situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I hope your kids both learn from your behavior and do better for each other.", "ESH. My mother and her sisters were competitive with each other and used their respective children in their little game just as you and your sister do. It\u2019s horrible for the kids - as adults, us cousins have realized that we still have a lot of insecurities and resentment stemming from those years. You two need to grow up (and you also need to look up the meaning of nepotism).", "You need to look up the meaning of nepotism.  What your niece has is privilege- not nepotism.   YTA - they are 8.", "YTA for the nepo comments but NTA because money does buy advantages. That said let your child watch youtube videos to practice. It\u2019s free. Please do not indulge your sister in competitiveness. The kids are young. Let them enjoy what extra curricula\u2019s they can without the pressure of being the best in the family. There will always be someone else better at some things.", "Read little bit about nepo babies", "Guess what, if I had 100 celebrity trainers to teach me how to dance, I would fail.\nDance is also a natural skill and it seems you negate that fact.", "YTA. Is your daughter a product of nepotism too over a kid who\u2019s parents cannot afford basic dance class? Nepotism would be if your niece won solely because of who her parents are, not based on her talents or skills. Not just because she has extra practice.", "YTA. That\u2019s not what a nepo baby is. Stop being so jealous.", "YTA. You sound bitter & uneducated. This doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s about a dance competition.. it sounds like you\u2019re in competition with your sister & the kids are involved unnecessarily. They\u2019re freaking 8 years old. Are you instilling confidence in your child? Or are you just teaching her that she can\u2019t be better because of the lack of opportunities you aren\u2019t able to provide her? \n\nI came from nothing & I\u2019ll tell you straight up hard work pays off regardless of circumstances. You sound like an \u201ceat the rich\u201d type & it\u2019s not very becoming. Instead of bashing your sister about her choices you should focus on making better ones.", "YTA for not knowing what \u201cnepotism\u201d actually means but throwing it around like you\u2019re a whiny entitled child.", "I don't think you are using the word \"nepotism\" right.", "YTA i see you go to tiktok university and major in media illiteracy.", "YTA and ridiculous.  You also don't know what a 'nepo baby' is or what nepotism is. Get a dictionary.  And BTW...her daughter isn't winning contests because of money. Talent is talent.", "TIL you don't know what nepotism means.\n\nYTA", "Is money and connections the hidden superpower no one talks about?\n\n100%.\n\nBut that isn't what makes a nepo baby. Your niece would be a nepo baby if she sucked **and** your sis used her ex's connections to get the niece into a school or an audition. But that is not what is happening here. From your account, your niece does have talent. Does she get tutoring that your daughter doesn't? Yes, she does. But that's just another example of money being a huge cheat code in life. It doesn't make her a nepo baby though.\n\nYTA.", "But she was more pacific in her edit!", "Fr I read the title and was like she doesn't know what that word means.", "Oh come on, this is a clear ESH.

Yes? \n\"Sarah has the funds to dump money into privates and extra classes\".", "I got salty when she said \"I know I shouldn't of\" instead of \"shouldn't HAVE\". But i guys when you get pregnant at 16 you miss some important schooling.", "She clearly doesn't.", "Right?! unless her sisters ex husband got wealthy by  and basically control the local youth competitive dance scene (which seems like the plot for a tv show honestly) than this is definitely not a Nepo babe situation.", "The edit say the ex owns a company that works with celebrities and that the niece has access to people who worked with celebrities previously. \n\nMaybe I don't understand the word correctly but isn't this nepotism?", "Which one, though?  'Nepotism' or 'pacific'?", "i'm so happy that overhere we are not allowed to do competitions for children under 10.. Saves us fro a lot of potential issues", "Hey, didn't you read her edit, she's clearly *NOT* jealous. Lol\n\nIt looks like OP bottled up every resentment she had towards her sister and niece and dumped them all at once.", "Well tbf her sis made sketch comments on OP's daughter first.", "And, skill can be enhanced by privilege.", "This whole idea of privileged need to go away. We all have different advantages and disadvantages and there will always be someone better off than you, and someone worse off than you. It's not good to compare ourselves, or to compare \"priveleges\". If you work hard and have more money due to that,   good for you!", "You've obviously never watched \"Dance Moms\".", "Exactly. OP was out of line in not just accepting that it\u2019s the way things are and having to blame it on something. The sister was also out of line for being, at best, potentially patronising in the first place, and then putting her own niece down in retaliation. It\u2019s probably never gonna end well putting cousins in competition with each other when their mothers can\u2019t interact in a healthy way tbh. Also, as many have pointed out, it\u2019s really not nepotism, it\u2019s just having more resources.", "ESH, you two need to put petty bs aside for your kids.", "> sometimes people just have more talent then others. Plain and simple.\n\nYeah the sisters use of \"click\" is telling to me. I used to dance and be involved in theatre, you can go to the same class but the moves, choreography, musicality etc will click with some people and not others.\n\nIf OPs kids were truly interested and had the ability they could all train together or with friends.\n\nBallet kids are training everyday on their own time.", "I thought she was more Atlantic personally", "Why am I laughing this hard", "Fr I read the title and thought this was a new IVF procedure I hadn't heard about. \n\nBut pacifically, I never want to read the term, \"nepo baby\" again.

The pacific is an ocean.", "Pacific like the ocean?", "Pacific is an ocean. You mean specific.", "Also. When you say \u201cno one who has normal income like me\u201d you\u2019re proving the above\u2019s point. Income doesn\u2019t make it nepotism.

She said she was proud and knows she works hard and that if she keeps working hard, she will get there someday.", "Of course we can't let someone else's privileged life get in the way of our own growth. That is way I mentioned it's about how much effort we put in and knowing we tried is what matters. But if people were to recognize their own privilege and cultivate empathy for those who are not as lucky, it might just be a step towards having a kinder world and better distribution of equity. And of course maybe privileged people can be less egotistical.\n\nI mean I recognized my own privilege of growing up in the US compared to my cousin. It's like even though we both hold MBAs and we both applied for a position in the same company (this was when I was planning on moving to Asia) I was at an advantage simply because of English fluency. I don't think I'm better than my cousin for getting an offer, I know it's because they were at a slight disadvantage. \n\nSometimes privileged people didn't work hard to be at an advantage.", "What a privileged sounding POV..", "It is good when the privileged person doesn't recognize their privilege.", "Nope. I can only imagine the horror.", "Her attitude about her niece is pretty arctic imo.", "Doesn't know what pacific means either.

Not once has OP said her niece can't actually dance.", "Not hugely nepotism though. Nepotism involves using power to get jobs or better privileges.   \nThe  edit is highly suspicious too. If the OP really thought the kid was a \u2018nepo baby\u2019 she\u2019d have said this from the outset. I smell creative licence.   \n\n\nFinally\u2026 the kid is 8. Mum is 25. This means mum had kid at 17, pregnant at 16. Now it\u2019s entirely possible that all of this fantastical tale is true, but it\u2019s pretty fantastical. Pregnant to a rich guy at 16, he agrees to pay huge alimony and child support and hook his daughter up with shakira level choreographers at 8yrs of age and so on. I swear it\u2019s Day Time Soap Opera level fantasy. Could be true, but feels squiffy.", "Still, not nepotism. There taking advantage of knowing certain people. It's kind of what rich people with connections do.", "Thats the point tho, sis knows OP's situation compared to her and she tells her if her daughter works harder she will get it someday. Who tf says that. If two kids run and one of them has shoes and the other is barefoot, you don't tell the barefoot kid that maybe if he practice more he'll get it someday. Obviously in the face of talent, shoes wouldn't matter but not everyone is born with it.", "How is it privileged to say that people always have it better than you and some always has it worse? Everyone has some form of privilege. The problem with the context of how that word is used today it is often used to target specific for groups for being arbitrarily categorized as privileged.\n\nEdit: furthermore,  Sarah's daughter worked hard.  That's not being privileged.  That's called hard work pays off.", "I never said that. I identified the problems with the concept of being privileged.  I am not what you would consider \"privielged\" in many ways. And there are times in life where I had advantages. But everyone has advantages and disadvantages. The problem is with how the word privileged is used nowadays is it seeks to be a negative connotation for people who are arbitrarily deemed privileged.", "Yea but i think you're reading too much into it. Teaching kids that hard work pays off is a good thing. Having the most money or the best shoes or whatever doesn't guarantee the best success. MANY successful people in this day and age came from nothing and had to work hard.", ">Who tf says that.\n\nSomeone who love the niece who just lost a competition and wants her to keep her self-confidence and keep trying.", "But in this case, she is not \"arbitrarily deemed privileged\", she **is** privileged over her sister/niece in a very literal way. That doesn't make what OP did ok and OP is an AH, but your argument makes no sense."]}
