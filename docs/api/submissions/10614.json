Maybe I shouldn\u2019t of said it but I said, \u201cwell thank god she did because that would mean you spent all that money for no reason.\u201d  \n\nMy sister looks at me confused and I told her, well your daughter has a lot advantages compared to my daughter considering Sarah has more money to dump into it then I do, Sarah\u2019s ex husband comes from a rich family with connections and with that, she gets a lot of money from alimony and child support from him, so I just stated that her daughter is a clear example of nepotism and how being rich gives you a head start in numerous things. For example my niece has a private tutor to help stay up on top of her homework so she won\u2019t get behind. Sarah has the funds to dump money into privates and extra classes. Sarah also has a nanny to make sure her daughter makes it to these classes. My daughter doesn\u2019t have any of these things. so I feel like it\u2019s a stretch to say my niece solely wins on just hard work when in reality like my niece has more resources to become good.  Which is totally fine, because hell If I were in Sarah\u2019s position old do everything in my power to set my kid up for success. but my issue is her making it seem my daughter solely doesn\u2019t win because she doesn\u2019t work hard which isn\u2019t the case.\n\nSo My sister took great offense to this and claimed her children aren\u2019t nepo babies and that I\u2019m just jealous because her daughter constantly beats my daughter and that I just need to accept that maybe my daughter isn\u2019t that good.  We haven\u2019t talked since our fight but some say I\u2019m wrong for claiming my niece didn\u2019t work hard which isn\u2019t what I was trying to say. But AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: should be more specific but my sisters ex husband owns a company that his clients are primarily celebrities, with that my sister is able to get into contact with certain choreographers or master classes because of these connections . That someone like me is NOT able to do. For example she gets private from people who choreographed with people like Shakira & JLO and Secondly I\u2019m not jealous of my niece I\u2019m proud of her as well, I\u2019m just saying she had certain advantages.", "created_utc": 1677069504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118x35y/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_her_kids_are_nepo/", "score": 501, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your sister was a famous dancer who was able to get her child into a place that you couldn't BECAUSE she was a famous dancer, that would be a Nepo baby.   Just having money doesn't make her a Nepo baby, it makes her have advantages.   Your jealousy and envy of your sister is toxic and gross.  Grow up.  Petty jealousy isn't a good look on anyone.", "\"her daughter is a clear example of nepotism\"\n\nOP doesn't know what nepotism means.  \n\nHer daughter is a clear example of growing up with privileges that you can't afford, sure.  But that's not what nepotism means.\n\nAlso, YTA  This has been building for a while and you let it all out at once to ruin your sisters day.  This could have been handled better.\n\nPrivileged or not, you haven't shown that your sister is wrong with her claim that her daughter worked hard.", "YTA. You seem to be confused about what nepotism is. Nepotism would be that your niece got into a dance school owned by the ex husband\u2019s family. Having more resources does not equal nepotism. You sound bitter and jealous of your sister and you are taking it out on a child. Your sister is absolutely right. Take a look in the mirror and really think about whether this is the kind of person you want to be.", "YTA.   \nYou are saying that your niece has no ability or talent and only gets where she is because her mummy has money. The kid is EIGHT. This isn\u2019t Dance Mums or Teen Mums for heaven\u2019s sake!\n\nYes money makes that stuff easier for Sarah \u2026. Does your niece have three times as many lessons as your daughter? No? Then she\u2019s a better dance because SHE IS BETTER. Tutors do little more than babysit at this age unless they are learning disability qualified - you can help your daughter without paying for it and your daughter gets to keep up too.   \n\n\nI\u2019m sad for Sarah. She\u2019s taken the risk of having a mini moment of mummy pride, with family, who she should feel safe with\u2026 and you\u2019ve slapped her hard back. It\u2019s really hard to talk about when your kids are doing well because no one likes showboating and you just sank her Joy.

Your daughter will absolutely pick up on it, assuming she hasn\u2019t already.

Unless your sister is also the competition judge, nepotism isn\u2019t part of this discussion.\n\nYou are also jealous of your sister and her wealth.\n\nAttacking an 8 year old girl to make yourself feel superior to your sister is a terrible thing to do, and you owe that little girl an apology.  There is no amount of money you can pay to become a good dancer - just like any other skill it takes hard work and practice to become good.\n\nYou also are teaching your own 8 year old daughter that it is okay for a person in power (the adult) to belittle a person without power (8 year old child).  That is not even close to okay, and you need to get your own jealousy in check and stop teaching your daughter to act that way.\n\nYou are also teaching your daughter that winning is the most important thing.  When it should be to enhance her enjoyment of dancing.", "YTA. None of the things listed will make her a better dancer.

And anyone who says that you either got it or not is not thinking. So you think that natural talent is all that is really needed? Example I was in gymnastics growing up but only could afford a little time at gym and no real expensive trainer. I had a friend who had a private gym AND an Olympic trainer...her ability, and I don't hate on her bout it, she worked hard but clearly the advantages she got eventually overshadowed any natural talent I had. I mean that's common sense.", "Nepotism. You say this word yet you don\u2019t know what it means.\n\nYTA. You sound salty af that your sister has more resources than you.

Not saying your daughter doesn't but it's likely that Sarah's daughter is just naturally good at it whereas your daughter isn't. What you described isn't nepotism, it's privilege.

Your niece has had more and better opportunities than your daughter, but she\u2019s also put in the work to take advantage of those opportunities. It\u2019s not nepotism - her parents can simply afford to give her opportunities you can\u2019t afford to give to your daughter. Fair, no; but it\u2019s unfortunately reality. \n\nYour sisters comments (if you\u2019ve accurately described them) are condescending and she seems to want to rub your nose in it. Also saying \u2018maybe one day it will click for (your daughter)\u2019 is a pretty shitty thing to say to her niece when she knows the differences in your circumstances. So she\u2019s also an AH. \n\nIf you had simply responded by congratulating your niece, praising her efforts and hard work and said that you wish you could afford to give (your daughter) the same opportunities to nurture her talent - then I think you would not have been TA", "ESH. Your sister is an arsehole for condescendingly saying your daughter isn\u2019t good or doesn\u2019t work hard enough.\n\nYou are an arsehole for trying to create your own definition of the word nepotism.

Do yourself a favour and stop living in denial.", "Yta\n\n1) you don't know what they do\n2) being a dancer takens talent. Maybe your daughter isn't as good as her cousin.

Nepotism means being shown favoritism in a certain field or career because of who you\u2019re related to. Based on your write-up your niece is privileged, but that\u2019s not the same as nepotism.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that some people are more naturally talented at dancing than others. Just because your niece has advantages doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t practice or work hard. \n\nBut your sister is also an AH for saying one day it will click for your daughter.

And I'll tell you right now that it's difficult to make privileged people see how they're at an advantage.\n\nI grew up away from my dad's side of the family & didn't get to meet the whole family until I was in my late 20s. So when I met them, I was a stranger looking in and observing them. My well off aunt's & uncles were able to brag how well their children& grand children were doing in comparison because in every which way they were able to provide extra care. While for the rest it didn't matter how hard the kids may study or how much effort they put in, they were always at a disadvantage because of socioeconomic differences. The rich families had maids so their kids only tasks were to wake up, go to school and study, get driven from place to place. The middle class families didn't have all that so the kids did chores, took the bus to school, meaning it ate away at their time for relaxing and studying.\n\nI know that snide remark from your sister rubs you the wrong way because it was towards your child. But be the better person. Tell your kid it's ok to not always be the best and that sometimes some people are lucky to born with certain skills, or things come more naturally to them. Don't fret, because as long as they put in their best effort and know they tried their hardest, that's what matters.", "YTA. NEPOTISM AND BEING RICH ARE NOT THE SAME THING.

It's obvious that u r jealous of Sarah's money and of her daughter beating urs. It's an unfair situation, but then we live in an unfair world.\nThis is my speculation, but i feel u r upset that sarah's daughter gets to live in the lap of luxury and also gets to beat ur daughter (am not downplaying her efforts), while ur daughter has neither.

Maybe I shouldn\u2019t of said it but I said, \u201cwell thank god she did because that would mean you spent all that money for no reason.\u201d  \n\nMy sister looks at me confused and I told her, well your daughter has a lot advantages compared to my daughter considering Sarah has more money to dump into it then I do, Sarah\u2019s ex husband comes from a rich family with connections and with that, she gets a lot of money from alimony and child support from him, so I just stated that her daughter is a clear example of nepotism and how being rich gives you a head start in numerous things. For example my niece has a private tutor to help stay up on top of her homework so she won\u2019t get behind. Sarah has the funds to dump money into privates and extra classes. Sarah also has a nanny to make sure her daughter makes it to these classes. My daughter doesn\u2019t have any of these things. so I feel like it\u2019s a stretch to say my niece solely wins on just hard work when in reality like my niece has more resources to become good.  Which is totally fine, because hell If I were in Sarah\u2019s position old do everything in my power to set my kid up for success. but my issue is her making it seem my daughter solely doesn\u2019t win because she doesn\u2019t work hard which isn\u2019t the case.\n\nSo My sister took great offense to this and claimed her children aren\u2019t nepo babies and that I\u2019m just jealous because her daughter constantly beats my daughter and that I just need to accept that maybe my daughter isn\u2019t that good.  We haven\u2019t talked since our fight but some say I\u2019m wrong for claiming my niece didn\u2019t work hard which isn\u2019t what I was trying to say.

She has been riding since she was 5 years old and has had her own since she was 9 years old. My mother & I pay for all things equine. It's expensive. My daughter has one lesson a week on her current horse and competes once or twice a month. She works hard at her sport.\n\nWe are friends with many horsey people. The more successful ones have more money behind them and better horsey connections. They have several lessons a week, compete more often, and have better quality horses along with luxury horse lorries and top flight equipment and treatments for both horse & rider. And they just do better, get further up the rankings.\n\nSo, in a lot of cases, money & connections & opportunity does help massively. There will always be the story of the poorer background succeeding over the odds, but it's rare.\n\nMy daughter loves her horse, loves taking part in competitions and is totally onboard that her grandmother & I can only afford so much for her. \n\nI think OP is not bitter, she's just a realist. It is difficult to see your child continuously beaten by a child with so much more open to them. This does, of course, not mean that the privileged child does not also work hard and that their success is not all because of the money.\n\nOP would've done better to keep her thoughts to herself - they were never going to change the situation and she now does come across as bitter & jealous, although I don't think she actually is.\n\nOP, focus on your daughter and on your journey with her.

I have seen a lot of dance recitals over the years, as my cousin danced with a studio for 15 years. Let me tell you, many of the young kids are not super awesome at that age. Their movements are a little more choppy, they just don't have the same fluidity and grace that older kids do. So when you get a kid that IS that good, it definitely stands out. But I also know they likely have a passion for it and probably practice a lot at home as well as at lessons. \n\nYour kid will likely improve as well as she gets older, but it also depends on how much work she puts in on her own.

I cannot stand how both of you are making a competition out of your daughters\u2018 dancing skills. It\u2019s horrible. Who cares which daughter is better? Why are you so focused on that. They should be enjoying themselves.", "> That someone like me is NOT able to do.

YTA", "ESH. Your sister didn't need to bring up your daughter (which many people would take as a passive-aggressive shot) when saying she was proud of her own daughter, and you didn't need to go off on your sister about \"nepo babies.\" You two aren't competing against each other. Your daughters being involved in dancing at 8 years old isn't an opportunity for your and your sister's sibling rivalry.", "ESH. Dance Moms in particular always compete about who's kid is the best. It's ugly and shouldn't happen. You both need to apologize to each other and the girls. Just stop.", "YTA.  I\u2019m a dance teacher and I can tell you: talent (for lack of a better word) isn\u2019t something you can buy.

You are extremely jealous and I'm sure you know that. \n\n2. No. Her kids are not \"nepo babies\". They are fortunate to have the extra money and resources. But that is not nepotism. This is just a privilege.\n\n3. It takes talent and hard work to win a dance competition. I can't understand how nepotism helped her kid win. Again, I'm not saying that your kid lacks the talent or did not work hard. Nobody is saying that; not even Sarah. There was no need for you to become defensive when Sarah was just feeling proud of her daughter's achievement. You just couldn't contain all the jealousy inside of you and just had to spew your venom out. It is sad that you are in reality jealous of an 8 year old kid.", "YTA. Your jealousy of your sister is gross, and more importantly, you're setting your daughter up to have this toxic mindset as well. One of your daughters performed better than the other. It may or may not have anything to do with socioeconomic advantage she has. But instead of building your daughter up you're teaching her to tear others down to feel better about herself. Even if you think you don't say those things in front of her, kids are perceptive, and you're hurting both girls with this horrible attitude.", "Yta. She has more money than you but that is not what a nepo baby is. You\u2019re just jealous.", "YTA. Sarah\u2019s kids beat yours in a dance competition because they danced better.

I personally think its one of the grosser feelings.. and we all would benefit from acknowledging our jeaousy before speaking and acting on it. It is sooo easy to spot. OP.. I would spend some time trying to work on this jealousy.. Her daughter might just have dancing talent, that's fine! If your daughter isn't insecurities... then there isn't a problem. If she is... then I would wonder if there is a way to practice more or another hobby she can try. YTA", "OP is jealous and needs to make connections of their own.

I was about to post the definition of nepotism", "Yeah also..money gives advanttages but it doesnt buy talent....neice still has to have inate dexterity, mucle developmemt, and practice to consitently win... so she is putting in hard work...op makes it sound like her sisters paying off the judges", "Not privileged or not, the niece is clearly privileged, so when sister makes a passive aggressive comment about the daughter that it will click for her, then yeah pointing out the obvious privilege seems fair. I say NTA or everyone is", "I did so many extra maths classes as a kid. I worked far harder at maths than any other subject.\n\nI passed the qualification in high school for maths by one mark. I still didn\u2019t understand it and all the extra (unpaid) classes didn\u2019t give me a skill and I am still so lacking in basic maths confidence and understanding in my 40s and realised how much it holds my career back I just signed up for adult education.\n\nI did zero work in English class compared and am a professional writer. I learned both at a private prep school so yup, privileged. Except for a reason no one ever got to the bottom of I genuinely have the maths capacity of a 7 year old. I attended the equivalent of an Ivy school here at uni because maths doesn\u2019t count and by then I was a self supporting young adult who had very little privilege compared to my peers.\n\nI also hated maths and science and find them dull. English and similar just grabbed me. Even now passion is what usually plugs the gaps between privilege and skill for me. But hard work needs the right environment too. I can break my back pushing that door as the hardest working door pusher but it does very little if the door pulls open. Sometimes that is the \u2018clicking\u2019 of things coming together. It\u2019s not a diss, it\u2019s understanding people learn differently too.\n\nAnd also coasting in English and arts bit me in the ass when I hit uni. Hard work is discipline which is a skill.

Her niece has privilege and advantages, but is not the beneficiary of nepotism.", "you're wrong, op is allowing her daughter to be a victim of her circumstances instead of helping her find creative ways to practice and get better.", "When I was applying for schools I did not have any advantages nor any tutors, yet I put in the work myself and got top marks. So you can achieve big things with minimal investment if you put in the time to practice. If the 'poorer' girl has put in more hours practicing on her own she surely would have been better, and she would have had a chance of beating the other girl.", "So clearly we should add \"jealous\" to the list of things OP doesn't know the definition of, along with nepotism.", "I hope she lets go of her anger.

Using the wrong word doesn't change that. \n\n>Yes, the niece has additional resources and advantages the OP's daughter does not, but that also means the niece is putting in additional work that the daughter isn't.\n\nIf that's the lens you use then nepotism isn't bad. Which you're free to believe but then don't get offended if someone accuses you of nepotism. Which the sister did. \n\n\n>Moreover, the sister was probably just trying to encourage the OP , not make some sort of judgement call or attack which the OP seems to have taken it as.\n\nIt's called being condescending.

You really think living with a ballet coach that was instructing her didn't actually help?", "Any pacific reason?", "Right, but she only made that comment AFTER OP commented on all the money she was spending on her daughter, and how her connections impacted the result.

Copeland was introduced to ballet at 13 but she had already been under coaching (Her middle school drill instructor was classically trained) and her ballet instructor literally took her in to live with the woman's family. So she spent years having hundreds of hours of private lessons.
