How does your BF feel about this? That\u2019s what really matters.\n\nAlso, pay attention to how your BF handles this with his friend.  It will say a lot about the amount of respect he has for you.  It is fine that he didn\u2019t fight him or curse him out and instead ensured he left quickly before things escalated further, but he shouldn\u2019t allow his friend to speak to you in this way.", "NTA. You're correct in your assessment, but I wonder if there might be a question of your place. This was an agreement between Nate and your boyfriend, it's kind on him to say something. You showed that you care for your boyfriend, demanding that he be treated as he deserves, but it might not have been your place right then. \n\nJust something to consider next time.", "NTA\n\nSeems like he was taking advantage of your BFs generosity and he needed to be called out on it.", "NTA\n\nPeople will act like this is none of your business and you should've kept your mouth shut. But I think Nate is being very rude and disrespectful to your BF, and you wanted to defend him.\n\nYou just told him the truth because it is selfish to always to use the equipment for free and demand constant changes.\n\nYour BF should've defended you too since Nate called you a \"cold, blunt bitch\"", "NTA, but perhaps the better option would be to help your BF set hisown boundaries. He clearly struggles setting them with Nate and perhaps others as well. I think it's sweet that you're trying to fight his battles for him, but I wonder if Nate will ever take it seriously unless it comes from your BF himself. \n\nEither way, Nate is an AH. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nThe desire to protect your partner from being hurt is often stronger than the desire to protect yourself. Nate deserved what you said and I hope your boyfriend finds better friends - he sounds like a really decent guy.", "INFO : \n\nDid your boyfriend have any issues with you speaking up?", "NTA, your boyfriend is a bit of an easy target, Nate takes advantage of that, anger issues or not he needs to cut him out of his life now, tell him as doesn\u2019t like his work he best go find someone who does, help him stand up to this bully!!", "INFO: I wasn\u2019t able to understand, so maybe you can clear this up, but did your boyfriend yell at you or was it Nate? \n\nAlso NTA. Sometimes people are blind to how they are treated by the people they care for and that seems to be what is happening between your boyfriend and his \u2018friend\u2019.", "ESH - you were not wrong to call out Nate for being difficult (and he totally is an AH for calling you names) but your boyfriend had agreed to do it for free so it\u2019s not fair for you to demand payment on his behalf.\n\nBtw, in the future, your bf really should consider having informal contracts for \u201cfavor\u201d gigs.  Like, how much time he will spend on it, how many revisions, what the deliverables are, kill fees, etc.  I find people can be MORE demanding when you do things for free, so it\u2019s best to set limits.  This also can protect from hurt feelings, because as the creator, you can have a more objective measure whether it\u2019s a reasonable request or not.", "NTA but my takeaway here is that your boyfriend is going to continue being friends with an ingrate who takes advantage of him, has anger issues, and calls you foul names for pointing out the obvious. That is pretty concerning.", "YTA\n\nJust let your boyfriend do what he wants maybe he likes hanging out with the guy or something. \n\nIf he didn't like it he'd tell the guy he's busy. \n\nSounds more like you don't want him not hanging out with you or something.\n\nIt's his thing. You probably do things he doesn't like too.", "ESH. Your boyfriend is an adult. Let him handle his shit.", "Honestly, YTA because it isn't your business.

He just told me he appreciated me being honest with Nate as he\u2019s tried to subtly tell him that multiple times. But he advised me not to get in between Nate like that again because he has anger issues and he doesn\u2019t want Nate calling me names like that again or worse", "Nate was the one that yelled at me after I called him selfish. My boyfriend was just very shocked and didn\u2019t know what to do so he just told Nate to leave right away", "I should\u2019ve added this to my post but me and my boyfriend had a talk after Nate left about cutting him out of our lives. He\u2019s obviously not a good person so yea my boyfriend agreed their friendship is over", "Some people really struggle with setting boundaries and dealing with confrontation.  I'm one of those people and am working on it. But it's possible her boyfriend is similar (seems pretty obvious to me really) and needed help calling Nate out on his shitty behavior.", "The boyfriend is fine.. it's the friend of the boyfriend that is the asshole.", "I don\u2019t blame my boyfriend at all. He\u2019s such a gentle guy and doesn\u2019t like confrontation. He was so shocked when Nate called me that, the only words he could say was telling Nate to leave. After Nate left he felt very bad he didn\u2019t defend me. He really is just too much of a sweetheart to raise his voice\ud83d\ude05", "Wow. If your boyfriend thinks you are unsafe around Nate, he should tell Nate to stay away from both of you, not tell you to not make Nate angry.", "Thank you for answering my question. \n\nThe anger issues Nate has is cause for concern.\n\nNTA.", "From the other things you have posted\u2026 stay clear and see if your boyfriend will maybe cut/lower his contact with Nate at least where he can\u2019t be around if you\u2019re over.", "That's good. You don't deserve to be spoken to that way, and you shouldn't have to walk on eggshells for someone prone to anger when his bad behavior is questioned.", "Yup you got it, my boyfriend is a very non confrontational person. He never raises his voice and he struggles setting boundaries, especially with Nate because they\u2019ve been friends for so long. My boyfriend just wants to help everyone at his own expense \ud83d\ude05", "I agree with /u/sirajanahara here. Her stepping over the BF's boundaries to help him defend his boundaries from Nate isn't helping anything. She can talk to BF about boundaries at some other time when they are alone if that works for both of them. Jumping in and holding his boundaries for him isn't helping.", "That's fair enough, maybe I was a bit harsh before. I see from your other replies that you say nate has anger management issues, probably best that you guys don't invite him around anymore \ud83e\udd14. \n\nOut of curiosity do you think your bf will continue to do free things for nate?", "Agh, I meant to put what you so succinctly said in my post. I feel the same. Nate is waving lots of red flags.", "UGH i feel that lol. He sounds like a great guy and I am glad he has someone like you!! :)", "I hear you because I am also someone who's struggledtoset healthy boundaries, but you can't set boundaries for other people without their permission. Had he come to you and asked you for help that'd be different. Have you considered that you may not have all the facts? I get that it is hard to watch people get taken advantage of (beleive me I have a lot of experience with this as well), but you cannot help someone who doesn't want to be helped. I understand that your heart was in the right place, but I still feel your response was inappropriate.", "Seeing someone else actually enforce those types of boundaries can really help the mindset of someone that struggles with it. I'm not saying he should rely on only her to set his boundaries for him forever and I agree that it's definitely something he should try to work on. But when you're someone that has an extreme anxiety of confrontation and telling people \"I'm not doing that\" then I think having someone that you respect stick up for you can absolutely boost your confidence in trying to be more stern next time.", "Modeling good boundaries is great. Enforcing someone else's boundaries without being asked to is just another form of stepping over boundaries.", "YTA. It was not your place to speak up. Your BF wants to be a business man he needs to take charge.", "This. Looks like a weak person that needs a reality check.", "Exactly", "Info is Nate your man's dealer or something?"]}
