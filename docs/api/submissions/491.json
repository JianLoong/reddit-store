It wasn't an easy choice, and despite living here we have completely separate finances. MIL made it clear she would not be paying for anything for us, cooking for us, and didn't want us in her space. That is fine. We have been buying all of our own food and avoiding her as much as possible.\n\nMIL recently started bringing her new boyfriend \"Ken\" around. At first he was very nice and seemed surprised at how we lived. We seemed to want to fix MILs relationship with my husband, and offered to buy more food so we could eat, and invited us out a couple times.\n\nI really liked Ken at first, but then he changed overnight. MIL mentioned something about the time she was alone on Christmas, and he asked why she was alone on Christmas. MIL explained it was right after FIL left and it was our Christmas to be with my parents. She also said she was depressed because her birthday is the week and she had just turned 40, and he looked at us in disgust and asked why wouldn't we change plans based on the circumstances.\n\nBefore we could even explain he called my husband a piece of shit and said clearly I control him and he isn't man enough to do anything about it. Since then Ken has been really mean. He won't talk to us, rolls his eyes if we talk at all. He's been spending a lot more time here lately and bringing his dog which we are not allowed to pet. He told his teenage daughter to stay away from me as i am trash, and he told MIL she was right and he was sorry for interfering, and she should stop letting us have food.\n\nThe final straw was over the weekend a client of his gave him some tickets for a local event with some VIP access. He invited MIL, his daughter, and his daughter's boyfriend, and gave someone who works for him two of the tickets. He still had two left over, so he took them outside and lit them on fire.\n\nNow I know we aren't entitled to the tickets, but to me that was so cruel, petty, ridiculous. I went outside and told him I am not responsible for his girlfriend's train wreck life, her divorce, or the fact she was alone, and he is acting like a loser. Why is a grown man even this upset over Christmas. I told him he probably still believes in Santa and he needs to grow the hell up and stop acting like a white knight bully.\n\nMIL is now not speaking to me and is refusing to speak to any family who speaks to me, and called me trashy and disrespectful and said I need to shut up while living in her house. I think this grown ass man needs to stop worrying about Christmas.", "created_utc": 1667141603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhg7zk/aita_for_confronting_mils_boyfriend_calling_him_a/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do you avoid her? Why don't you try talking to her when she's lonely?
