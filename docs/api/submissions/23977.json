Why did the hospital staff believe you harmed your child?", "Could have been the healthcare provider too", "You all sound terrible.", "The whole situation is sort of TAH....\n\n1. the only solution to a fussy baby is tv?!\n2. get your own account\n3. INFO: is there a reason (besides him being an AH) for calling child protective services? He should be held accountable for that behavior. It sounds like since you had a file there were already issues? \n4. does CPS really spend time investigating a chipped tooth. In which case, I got lucky when a Pizza Hut breadstick chipped my daughter's teeth.\n5. cut anyone out of your life that hurts you and is toxic. But, if you do, see 2. above cause I doubt he'll let you use it now.  \n\nBasicially I have a headache now, so can everyone get off the streaming service so I can soothe myself to sleep....", "ESH.\n\nWhy not just ask him about it? Your brother may think that the discussion went nowhere productive, and was a waste of time in letting you know while you were dealing with medical stuff regarding your child.", "You don't know he called DCFS. In fact, you may PREFER if he did because then it would be easier to blame a spiteful brother, than be scared that the hospital sent them to investigate after seeing your kid's injuries. Right?\n\nFrom his pov: your child got injured, you started yelling about tv instead of comforting your cry child... \n\nSo yeah, sounds like you're looking for someone to blame for the DCFS visit.", "I know this isn\u2019t the thing to get hung up on, but I can\u2019t help it. \n\nHow much does the streaming service cost and why does it have to be shared? Can you get your own uninterrupted plan? \n\nI\u2019m American and definitely know things can be different elsewhere. But I can\u2019t imagine a situation where you have to badger another person to stop using a shared service so you can make your child the priority. \n\nIt feels, to me, like you want to drop a family member because of money. But maybe I\u2019m completely misreading the situation. I have to assume there\u2019s some background knowledge that would make this make more sense.", "YTA for not at least talking to him first. There might be a reason for him not telling you.", "This is so confusing.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the streaming service. It seems from your comments you're mad at your brother for not telling you that, what I believe is child protection services in your country, called him? Or called around to the house? And you want to cut him off becuase of that?\n\nMaybe he knew your mum already told you they called? Maybe not. Maybe he couldn't be arsed becuase he's an AH.\n\nCutting him off over just that seems extreme, but by the sound of it you don't have a relationship and have now got your own streaming service so no need to talk to him if you don't want to. Not sure why you need reddit to tell you that.\n\nBut maybe your biggest concern should be your child and getting back to child services rather than this.", "I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here but this isn\u2019t the first interaction with Child Services IP has had\u2026 they \u201cpopped by\u201d?

Maybe he assumed you already knew. Maybe he didn\u2019t realize it was that big a deal. Maybe he was planning to tell you, but something came up and he forgot. I\u2019d say he\u2019s inconsiderate no matter what his thought process was, but not to a degree that warrants completely cutting him out of your life with no warning. The whole streaming spat is also just kinda petty. Yeah he was rude, but so were you, stopping him in the middle of an episode so your kid can watch cartoons. I know that\u2019s not the situation you wanted judgement on, but you should\u2019ve just gotten your own account when he said he didn\u2019t want to stop watching. Especially since you signed up later that day. Just immaturity all around.", "Nah. In fact, my cousin did the same thing, and when it happened (last year) that same day CPS came, I stopped all communication with my dad's side of the family. She did it because she in a way got called out on her BS by my fiance and she didn't like it. To make matters worse, my aunt (cousins mom) indirectly admitted that it was my cousin.", "I'm going for ESH here. Your brother is definitely AH, but find another way to calm and entertain your child, or get a separate streaming account, jesus Christ.", "Yeah, I\u2019d cut off a family member who spoke to DCHF without telling me, I might talk to him first but certainly distance myself from someone who doesn\u2019t understand the seriousness of the matter.", "Info: it sounds like your brother assumed the worst; is there past evidence for him to base that off?", "I'm guessing you didn't have a good relationship to start if you use your mom as a go between. If you've used your mother to solve your conflicts in the past and on this occasion, why would your brother contact you? Cutting him off sounds more like a projection of your fears of the current situation. While it would have been courteous, if you don't talk often and there's existing resentment, would you expect him to reach out?\n\nConflict is hard, though you should probably take this as an opportunity to communicate with him. Then depending on his reaction consider the right course for your family.", "You're NTA.  I have a sister who is full of drama and I've cut her out of my life.  I've forgiven her, but I will never forget how crazy she is.  My life is so much more peaceful.", "Snip snip, cut him out and save future drama", "You are NTA.
