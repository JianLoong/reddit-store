He's supposed to maintain the cars, and you pay the car expenses. But he's not maintaining the cars as agreed, and he doesn't want to teach either or you anything and expects you to google it. What exactly does he do besides work? My dad was a mechanic and taught me how to maintain my car by making me do it while he instructed me. He'd also remind me about it when it was time until I got in the habit of doing it myself. Your husband is being an AH. Son's taillight is broken? Take him to the store and help him learn how to buy the right one, then back home and son installs it under husband's direction.", "He\u2019s coming at this in an awful way, but if you\u2019re driving the car, you should know what the indicator lights and tire pressure should be.

It's obvious there's underlying issues behind all of this.\n\nYes, it might be frustrating for your husband but it's also frustrating for you to work, cook, wash dishes, put the table, wash dishes again, clean, do laundry, etc.\n\n\nBut I stand my ground that your adult on med school son should definitely know how to Google things.", "You Google 'car model car year Tyre pressure'", "She might argue that if it's his job to maintain the car, he should be checking on these things and fixing brakelights when they're out.   \n\nI do like the recommendation to see if she and her son can take a course, because it's easier to change yourself than change someone else.    If the course gave them an overall sense of how a car works, they might be able to retain things differently.    Manuals often assume a basic level of knowledge.   It would be a lot better if you knew how to do basic things and what to look out for.    Perhaps you and your son should carry little notebooks to consult about these basics, including when and how, if you don't remember.    These are good things to know with or without your husband.\n\nThe question about whether he generally acts like a partner remains.

Husband may learn/teach in a different way.  \nTake a class not taught by husband.  But also, yes, things like Googling tyre pressure or what is needed for driving on snow really aren't a Mechanic's issue--they are a Driver's issue.\n\nNow if you ask a question on a catalytic converter--that he would know about.(not that he doesn't know the other two--just that they aren't what the mechanic does--it's what a responsible car owner does).\n\nit sounds like your son is an adult who should understand basic car maintenance.
