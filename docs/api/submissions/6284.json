She violated your privacy by reading your messages. Is she going to go through your stuff and tattle to your family about anything she finds inappropriate?

I'd also point out how hurtful it is to you that they so easily believed that you were a sex worker, and that they turned on your bf and believed him to be a pervert simply because of something Julie said. They have shown they have no trust in you and instead of trying to find the truth, they've been trying to lead you back to the right path, a path you've never deviated from. Tell them to focus their efforts on teaching Julie not to read other people's messages and tell lies/twist the truth, and to ask themselves why they are so willing to believe such things about you.

Normally someone leaving has to give due notice or at least cover their expenses for an amount of time to give the rental holder a chance to find someone to replace you. If you just got up and left at the beginning of the month, I assume you at least paid your fair share of expenses. \n\nI think it\u2019s good you got out immediately however as it seems like your family was causing you a lot of stress. And regardless of how angry you are with your cousins and who else you\u2019d been co-renting with, you just need to make sure you are still the adult that has done the responsible thing when it comes to moving out.", "NTA. What goes on between you and your boyfriend us your business and she fucked around in your business, and found out what those consequences where and your parents are assholes for not believing you or your boyfriend.", "Find some one to replace Julie. Then move back in.", "nta, they magically saw the light after it affected their finances lol.  the damage has been done, don't go back", "NTA. You were made to feel ostracized in the place you should have been safest, your home. You deserve to live somewhere that you're not called out unnecessarily over something that isn't true.", "Yta. How is this even up for debate. If your name was on the lease you wouldn't just walk away.b", "No. That\u2019s a funny joke though. I have a porn star friend that said his family cried when he told them. His sister thought it was funny. Now he\u2019s a cop.", "NTA. FOMO", "I suppose she might have made a genuine misunderstanding, but it certainly doesn't sound like she was interested in finding out the truth, just stirring up trouble. If someone's going to make your home into an unwelcoming environment, I don't think they have any right to complain about you leaving.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "This!  Simply put, Julie played stupid games and won stupid prizes.\n\nNTA", "BURN!!!", "Agreed, NTA. Why would they wait to \u201cpromise\u201d and actually stop your fam from coming in when you were living there? Sounds like they want you pay for Julie\u2019s nosey ass and inappropriate behavior. Don\u2019t go back.", "But not for free.", "NTA. Play idiotic games, win inept awards.", "Toxic is the perfect description for your idiot cousin. She was trying to humiliate you in front of family, plain and simple. NTA and I would never set foot in the same house as your cousin. nc with her and explain everything to your parents. If they still won't accept the truth. Put them on ignore for a while at the very least.", "Honestly the friend is the only one I feel badly for. Laura obviously was also letting in family even knowing what was going on and did nothing to clarify. The friend was in a weird situation where it\u2019s not really her place to address or keep family of 75% of her roommates out, and yet she just got her rent raised by 33% without any warning.", "Initially I felt sorry for cousin laura and roomie BUT  <<*because my cousins kept letting our family in even though I was trying to avoid them*\\>>  So Laura kept letting them in TOO.  If she had shown OP some support, I would have maintain that she got bad end of stick, but She deserved it to as she helped make OP's home hostile.", "Except he didnt demand them and OP didnt tell her mother. Basic reading comprehension matters.", "That was my reaction. I mean, what the hell? That, along with telling the family, is all you really need to know about Julie. NTA, btw.", "Right? I'm shocked how the OP just kind of strolled past this \"I didn't realize she was...\" WHAT? Of course you didn't realize someone was purposefully breaking into your phone to invade your privacy then use that private information to ruin your relationship with your parents.  \n\n\nNTA", "People who look at other people\u2019s screens without being invited to are AHs. There\u2019s this guy at work who always stares at people\u2019s phones, and if he sees anything he thinks might be \u201crisqu\u00e9\u201d he\u2019ll be all \u201cOOHHH WHATS THAT?!\u201d All loud and annoying. I was going through some pictures and I have some of myself shirtless just to track my weight loss, and he was freaking out as if I had nudes open or some shit.", "NTA.The fact that this is the worst of it should make Julie happy.", "Agreed. Julie should feel lucky that this is the worst of it.\nNTA.", "They made their bed and now have to sleep in it.", "[removed]", "yes she should tell her cousin.", "Agreed", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "The entire family is toxic in this situation. The fact that they would take something like this at face value, not allow OP to explain herself, and repeatedly harass her over it is completely insane.", "Wait until Julie finds out that sometimes they have sex, sometimes after one of them BOUGHT THE OTHER DINNER.\n\nSometimes they GET A HOTEL ROOM under THEIR OWN NAMES just BRAZENLY announcing their intention to spend the night together.", "NTA. She infringed on op privacy.", "NTA. That\u2019s just a toxic person. So glad you have moved out.", "Totally agree", "I hope they are mad at Julie for the shit show and damaged relationships she caused.", "Bot", "[removed]", "Bot. As much as I appreciate the pun on cake day"]}
