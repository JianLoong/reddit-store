She violated your privacy by reading your messages. Is she going to go through your stuff and tattle to your family about anything she finds inappropriate?

I'd also point out how hurtful it is to you that they so easily believed that you were a sex worker, and that they turned on your bf and believed him to be a pervert simply because of something Julie said. They have shown they have no trust in you and instead of trying to find the truth, they've been trying to lead you back to the right path, a path you've never deviated from. Tell them to focus their efforts on teaching Julie not to read other people's messages and tell lies/twist the truth, and to ask themselves why they are so willing to believe such things about you.
