She violated your privacy by reading your messages. Is she going to go through your stuff and tattle to your family about anything she finds inappropriate?

I'd also point out how hurtful it is to you that they so easily believed that you were a sex worker, and that they turned on your bf and believed him to be a pervert simply because of something Julie said. They have shown they have no trust in you and instead of trying to find the truth, they've been trying to lead you back to the right path, a path you've never deviated from. Tell them to focus their efforts on teaching Julie not to read other people's messages and tell lies/twist the truth, and to ask themselves why they are so willing to believe such things about you.

Laura is the only one with a tenency agreement, which sounds to me like OP wasn't on a lease. \n\nBasically, if OP didn't break a lease, you'd be fine wkth her actions, right?", "Now you're really reaching.", "Good bot", "No. Even when having roommates it's an asshole move to just leave without notice. You instantly make the burden fall on the other roommate. That's my point. That's what makes her the asshole. At the very least she should pay the next month or 2. That would make her not the asshole.", "Look it up it's a real thing", ">Even when having roommates it's an asshole move to just leave without notice. You instantly make the burden fall on the other roommate. That's my point. That's what makes her the asshole.\n\nNo, that's what contracts and leases are for. If you want to avoid the possibility of a roommate leaving whenever they want, then you draft a contract stipulating rules for it. By not doing so, you are essentially saying \"I accept the risks of entering an arrangement where my roommates can leave at will.\" That's what leases *are for.* If OP, Laura, and Julie didn't make a lease agreement, then it stands to reason that they were willing to take on the risk that something like what OP did would happen. \n\nIt's also not an asshole move to leave when someone has created a hostile environment for you to live in.", "Sucks that Julie would create this situation for her other roommates by being an asshole and creating conflict when she knew there was no legally binding reason for OP to stay and endure it via a lease. Julie really should step up and pay the difference so the burden doesn't fall on the other roommates since it's *entirely her fault*.\n\nOP has no legal or ethical obligations here. Julie does.\n\nNTA, OP.", "I understand that it happens, I just believe you're really reaching in *this* case as there are no signs of abuse.", "Bro this is the real world. There could be numerous reasons why someone isn't on a lease or a contract. At the end of  day it's still an asshole move to just leave with no notice at all. If it was just 2 people each paying 2k and one decides on a whim to leave with no notice how is that not an asshole move. The other person's rent just doubled to 4k. But they aren't in a contract?! Doesn't fucken matter. Still makes you an asshole. \n\nYou know it's possible for someone to be in the right and be an asshole. Right?", "If OP had left for no reason, or just bc she wanted to live with her bf for funsies or whatever, I would agree with you. But it's one thing to leave with no warning/planning when there's nothing wrong and another to leave bc your roommate caused a serious issue in your familial relationships that was starting to spill into your home life. \n\nOP left bc she was getting distressed; her emotional and mental health was being negatively affected, and she no longer had safety, security, and peace at her apartment. She didn't bail bc she was just tired of living there, she left bc the apartment was no longer a suitable living place for her solely due to her roommate's actions. If Julie wamted to avoid that, she shouldn't have involved OP's family in a personal matter that obly involved OP amd her boyfriend and allowed relatives into the apartment if they were going to attack OP."]}
