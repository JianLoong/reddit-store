My parents split up before I was born, custody is I live with my dad most of the time and my mom every other weekend (plus random staying with her if I want) Recently, my dad got engaged to \u201cHanna\u201d, and she and her kids are moving in. Hanna\u2019s kids ages are: 9, 7, 2, 2, 2. She is widowed, so they live with her full time. \n\nThis made room arrangements a bit awkward, since there\u2019s only 3 kids bedrooms to go around. Dad and Hanna talked it over last night (without consulting anybody) and Hanna came over this morning to announce with my dad what they decided. Apparently, they want 9 and 7 to each have their own rooms, and me to share with the triplets because my room is significantly bigger than the others \u201cand I don\u2019t stay there full time\u201d. \n\nI said their plan was stupid, they wanted me to share with 3 toddlers. They said they didn\u2019t want me to move but it was the biggest room so other people should share. I said I didn\u2019t care if I switched rooms, because the more logical move would have been the triplets in the big room, 7 and 9 share, and I get my own (I said I\u2019d take the smallest one) until I move out. They said it would be more work to move my things to another room, and their idea was more \u201cpractical\u201d. Then asked why I was so pressed since I don\u2019t even live here full time. \n\nI said not staying in the room four days a month was a sorry excuse to land me with a bunch of toddlers, and if they seriously planned on doing it to me I\u2019d make the custody arrangement change and I\u2019d stay with mom for the most part (I know she doesn\u2019t mind because both of them remind me I could stay with her whenever I wanted).\n\nThis made Hanna cry because she just wants her family to blend together nicely and apparently I was ruining her plans. This made dad mad at me and Im not allowed to talk to Hanna until she forgives me. I didn\u2019t know this meant so much to them but I\u2019m still saying I\u2019ll stay with mom longer if I have to share with toddlers,but my dad made me feel a bit guilty so AITA?", "created_utc": 1689907875, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155bc4z/aita_for_saying_i_would_stay_at_my_moms_if_i_had/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hanna and your dad are buttheads and I mean that as politely as I can due to your age. Your plan works the best in every scenario except whatever Hanna is thinking. Almost seems like she either A) Trying to force you to move out by doing this or B) Forcing you to be the defacro babysitter/parent of 3 two year olds because it would be more convneient and makes sense since you are already there. Either case sucks and is not fair. If ya dad doesn't want you to talk to Hanna until you apologise, it sounds like a good deal to me. Don't.", "You are not the Asshole. I felt sad reading this. This is clearly a terrible idea to stick you with toddlers. My guess is that when you spoke with them you were angry (I would be) and the anger upset Hanna. It may be better to stay with your mom for awhile during this adjustment process. I really hope that more communication happens around this so you can get along with this new part of your family", "Definitely NTA. Hanna sounds like she is either trying to chase you out of the house and/or looking for free childcare. No doubt those toddlers will be seen as your responsibility once they\u2019re moved into that room. I suggest telling them that they either comply with your idea where you get the smallest room to yourself or you\u2019ll request an adjustment to the custody agreement so you\u2019re primarily with your mom and your dad gets visitation. This will not end well for you otherwise, take it from someone who has been in a very similar position but didn\u2019t put up enough of a fight to win.", "NTA she cry because her free babysitter gonna run away.", "NTA - Will she still want 'blended' after you move out but the first person to call for a babysitter? I think she wants you gone completely but doesn't have the guts to say it.", "NTA and I'd tell your dad that you're perfectly happy not talking to Hanna and don't care if she ever forgives you. Either you get a room to yourself or you live with your mom. Period.", "NTA, that sounds miserable to have that many kids around and you can\u2019t possibly share a room with three two-year olds.  You\u2019d never get any sleep or privacy. You\u2019ll be happier and get better sleep at your mothers.", "NTA. Don't ever stop standing up for yourself. They don't seem to want to treat you like a living breathing person if they don't even take your feelings into consideration.", "NTA this is incredible unfair to you. Plus heads up this isn\u2019t about them blending families. Hanna is pissed because her built in babysitter isn\u2019t buying into her blended family act.\n\nWho do you think will be I charge of fairing for 3 toddlers? You who do you think will be getting up with 3 toddlers? You. Your ruining her perfect dream. A built in nanny for 3 toddlers.\n\nDon\u2019t let your dad guilt or manipulate you. Go to i I our mom asap and tell them their plan. Your not be unreasonable. They where planning to use you for free child care!", "NTA\u2026blending your family together is not saddling a teenager with 3 toddlers to share her room with.  You offered a fair compromise, moving to the smaller room but that\u2019s too much work.  Who cares if Hannah cried?  Your dad needs to get his head out of his ass and think about how this is impacting you\u2026.his child.\n\nI\u2019m a little confused about the timeline.  Hannah\u2019s triplets are 2 and she\u2019s a widow.   How long is this relationship with your dad? \n\nGo live with your mom.  Let Hannah grow up and stop trying to make you out to be the problem.  Your dad needs to grow a pair and stand up for you too but looks like he\u2019s blinded by this relationship.  Don\u2019t be suckered into being the live in babysitter for the triplets. Not your responsibility.", "NTA Hanna had a completely terrible idea that NOBODY is ever going to think is a good idea and then when it was pointed out to her, she cried and refused to discuss it. Your Dad is weak. He should be mediating this better. \n\nThose little kids will be into all your stuff and drive you bonkers. Are they looking for a night nurse? That\u2019s what you\u2019ll end up being. I\u2019d move to your Mum\u2019s too. Hanna is not trying to blend the families at all. She\u2019s lying.", "NTA \n\nHannah thinks the best way for her \u201cfamily\u201d to \u201cblend together nicely\u201d is to instantly make her step-daughter the free babysitter for her **3** Toddlers?? \n\nDang, like\u2026 at least the evil step-mother waited till Cinderella\u2019s father died, not just made her a free maid instantly \n\nAlso, your dad kinda sucks, who in their right mind would want to share a room with 3 toddlers? Let alone someone that\u2019s almost an adult? He\u2019s favorizing his step-kids over his bio daughter to keep Hannah happy, and he\u2019s willing to make YOU sacrifice things like your privacy", "NTA\n\nThis room arrangement is insane. How will you get any quiet and privacy for studying? What about privacy during your menses? The two-year-olds will get into all your belongings and possibly damage them. Their diapers will smell. \n\nI think Hanna is being sneaky and manipulative. She intends to push you out of your home by making you share your room with three toddlers. Her crying and \"hurt feelings\" are more manipulative tactics to turn your father against you, and it looks like it's working. You don't owe Hanna or your father any apologies. Also, when your father wants you to babysit Hanna's kids, as I'm sure he will, you have the right to refuse. \n\nTalk with your mother about this and see if you can stay with her permanently.", "NTA\n\nThey're 3 freaking 2 yo toddlers. You should NOT be expected to deal with 3 toddlers invading your space and it's obvious your dad has chosen his new family over your wants and needs. It's already obvious Hannah doesn't even care to pretend to care for you as a stepmom your opinions don't matter to her. a 16 yo needs their own room and not to mention you've already been staying in this house longer and that's already your established room. You dad didn't even consult you and include you in the discussion? nah ef that.\n\nPft not allowed to talk to hannah until she forgives you. How about not talking to either of them until they at least apologize for never consulting you.\n\nI'd say stay with your mom forever and this is grounds to cut your dad out of your life let alone feel guilty about it. He willfully took your safe space from you.", "NTA the b\\*tch is not crying because she wants a blended family, she is crying because she wants a f\\*cking nanny.", "NTA, from a parent. Really sounds like they wanted an extra child minder at night.", "NTA. Evil stepmother much? And why do the fathers always side with the evil stepmothers over their own child?\n\nYour plan is the most logical, with the triplets in one room, the younger two in another, and you by yourself.\n\nYou go live with your mother if they won't listen to reason. You are too young to be parenting triplet toddlers, because I'm sure that's what they're hoping.", "NTA you're 16, wth would they think you wanted to share a room with not just 1 crying baby but 3 of them? Better off moving in with mom", "NTA. Expecting a 16 yo only child to accept living with 2 yo triplets is... no. Just no. Not acceptable.", "NTA. I agree with you. 16 and sharing with 2 year olds? Diapers, changing tables, cribs, naptimes ... and teenage late study time, early hours for school, friends over, music, privacy? WTH??! What are they thinking?\n\nI'm the parent of four, blended family. This arrangement makes no sense, plus, they didn't even ask you for input. AND, this family is moving into your home. So you are disregarded in this? I don't get it. A few of the busiest years of your life- with a lot of growing up and decisions to make- are in front of you. And it's the same for the 2 year olds- from 2 yrs to 4, 5 years old? And then what- have nothing, no space to come home to? Do they \\*want\\* you to leave? \n\nI really hope your dad and Hanna wake up and realize that they need to treat you a bit differently than the younger children. Because this isn't a good start.
