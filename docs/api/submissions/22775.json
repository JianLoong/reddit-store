My parents split up before I was born, custody is I live with my dad most of the time and my mom every other weekend (plus random staying with her if I want) Recently, my dad got engaged to \u201cHanna\u201d, and she and her kids are moving in. Hanna\u2019s kids ages are: 9, 7, 2, 2, 2. She is widowed, so they live with her full time. \n\nThis made room arrangements a bit awkward, since there\u2019s only 3 kids bedrooms to go around. Dad and Hanna talked it over last night (without consulting anybody) and Hanna came over this morning to announce with my dad what they decided. Apparently, they want 9 and 7 to each have their own rooms, and me to share with the triplets because my room is significantly bigger than the others \u201cand I don\u2019t stay there full time\u201d. \n\nI said their plan was stupid, they wanted me to share with 3 toddlers. They said they didn\u2019t want me to move but it was the biggest room so other people should share. I said I didn\u2019t care if I switched rooms, because the more logical move would have been the triplets in the big room, 7 and 9 share, and I get my own (I said I\u2019d take the smallest one) until I move out. They said it would be more work to move my things to another room, and their idea was more \u201cpractical\u201d. Then asked why I was so pressed since I don\u2019t even live here full time. \n\nI said not staying in the room four days a month was a sorry excuse to land me with a bunch of toddlers, and if they seriously planned on doing it to me I\u2019d make the custody arrangement change and I\u2019d stay with mom for the most part (I know she doesn\u2019t mind because both of them remind me I could stay with her whenever I wanted).\n\nThis made Hanna cry because she just wants her family to blend together nicely and apparently I was ruining her plans. This made dad mad at me and Im not allowed to talk to Hanna until she forgives me. I didn\u2019t know this meant so much to them but I\u2019m still saying I\u2019ll stay with mom longer if I have to share with toddlers,but my dad made me feel a bit guilty so AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I\u2019m at my moms house at least for the weekend while the adults \u2018try to work things out\u2019 but my mom said I was welcome to live with her full time and if I really wanted we could change the custody agreement. :) Also thank you for all the replies I really wasn\u2019t expecting this to blow up as much as it did lol", "created_utc": 1689907875, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155bc4z/aita_for_saying_i_would_stay_at_my_moms_if_i_had/", "score": 11357, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hanna and your dad are buttheads and I mean that as politely as I can due to your age. Your plan works the best in every scenario except whatever Hanna is thinking. Almost seems like she either A) Trying to force you to move out by doing this or B) Forcing you to be the defacro babysitter/parent of 3 two year olds because it would be more convneient and makes sense since you are already there. Either case sucks and is not fair. If ya dad doesn't want you to talk to Hanna until you apologise, it sounds like a good deal to me. Don't.", "You are not the Asshole. I felt sad reading this. This is clearly a terrible idea to stick you with toddlers. My guess is that when you spoke with them you were angry (I would be) and the anger upset Hanna. It may be better to stay with your mom for awhile during this adjustment process. I really hope that more communication happens around this so you can get along with this new part of your family", "Definitely NTA. Hanna sounds like she is either trying to chase you out of the house and/or looking for free childcare. No doubt those toddlers will be seen as your responsibility once they\u2019re moved into that room. I suggest telling them that they either comply with your idea where you get the smallest room to yourself or you\u2019ll request an adjustment to the custody agreement so you\u2019re primarily with your mom and your dad gets visitation.

Either you get a room to yourself or you live with your mom. Period.", "NTA, that sounds miserable to have that many kids around and you can\u2019t possibly share a room with three two-year olds.  You\u2019d never get any sleep or privacy. You\u2019ll be happier and get better sleep at your mothers.", "NTA. Don't ever stop standing up for yourself.

Your dad needs to get his head out of his ass and think about how this is impacting you\u2026.his child.\n\nI\u2019m a little confused about the timeline.  Hannah\u2019s triplets are 2 and she\u2019s a widow.   How long is this relationship with your dad? \n\nGo live with your mom.  Let Hannah grow up and stop trying to make you out to be the problem.  Your dad needs to grow a pair and stand up for you too but looks like he\u2019s blinded by this relationship.  Don\u2019t be suckered into being the live in babysitter for the triplets.

How will you get any quiet and privacy for studying? What about privacy during your menses? The two-year-olds will get into all your belongings and possibly damage them. Their diapers will smell. \n\nI think Hanna is being sneaky and manipulative. She intends to push you out of your home by making you share your room with three toddlers. Her crying and \"hurt feelings\" are more manipulative tactics to turn your father against you, and it looks like it's working. You don't owe Hanna or your father any apologies. Also, when your father wants you to babysit Hanna's kids, as I'm sure he will, you have the right to refuse. \n\nTalk with your mother about this and see if you can stay with her permanently.", "NTA\n\nThey're 3 freaking 2 yo toddlers. You should NOT be expected to deal with 3 toddlers invading your space and it's obvious your dad has chosen his new family over your wants and needs. It's already obvious Hannah doesn't even care to pretend to care for you as a stepmom your opinions don't matter to her. a 16 yo needs their own room and not to mention you've already been staying in this house longer and that's already your established room. You dad didn't even consult you and include you in the discussion? nah ef that.\n\nPft not allowed to talk to hannah until she forgives you.

He willfully took your safe space from you.", "[removed]", "NTA, from a parent. Really sounds like they wanted an extra child minder at night.", "NTA. Evil stepmother much? And why do the fathers always side with the evil stepmothers over their own child?\n\nYour plan is the most logical, with the triplets in one room, the younger two in another, and you by yourself.\n\nYou go live with your mother if they won't listen to reason. You are too young to be parenting triplet toddlers, because I'm sure that's what they're hoping.", "NTA you're 16, wth would they think you wanted to share a room with not just 1 crying baby but 3 of them? Better off moving in with mom", "NTA. Expecting a 16 yo only child to accept living with 2 yo triplets is... no. Just no. Not acceptable.", "NTA. I agree with you. 16 and sharing with 2 year olds? Diapers, changing tables, cribs, naptimes ... and teenage late study time, early hours for school, friends over, music, privacy? WTH??! What are they thinking?\n\nI'm the parent of four, blended family. This arrangement makes no sense, plus, they didn't even ask you for input. AND, this family is moving into your home. So you are disregarded in this? I don't get it. A few of the busiest years of your life- with a lot of growing up and decisions to make- are in front of you. And it's the same for the 2 year olds- from 2 yrs to 4, 5 years old? And then what- have nothing, no space to come home to? Do they \\*want\\* you to leave? \n\nI really hope your dad and Hanna wake up and realize that they need to treat you a bit differently than the younger children. Because this isn't a good start.

Your suggestion makes WAY more sense to me, because it groups kids with similar age together.  9 and 7 are similar, 2/2/2 are similar, you're the outlier.  But that's 3 groups.  \n\nAnd speaking in general- they're on fucking crack if they expect a 16yo to be okay sharing a room with THREE 2yo's.  How the hell are you supposed to do homework with *three* toddlers?  You can't.  \n\nHere's what I think they are expecting:  I think they expect that you will befriend and adopt the toddlers, at which point you will become the free babysitter.  And they probably have a pie-in-the-sky vision of you being okay with this and being the happy loving big sister that takes the little ones under your wing.  \n\nWhat they don't realize is that FORCING an emotional connection in blended families is the #1 way to ensure an emotional connection NEVER happens.  \n\nPersonally I'd send them a letter.  Something they have to read and think about before they respond to it.  Email is good too.  Just put some time into writing it.  \nTell them you don't hate any of them, not Hanna, not the kids.  You want everybody to be happy.  You are glad Dad and Hanna make each other happy and for that reason alone you want to have a good relationship both with Hanna and her children.  And you very much want to work this out with them and try to be a family.  \nRight now though you feel you aren't being heard.  You feel that Dad and Hanna are so excited by the idea of living together that they aren't considering that you have real needs which don't go away.  And in doing so, they are assuming that you, a teenager / young adult, have the same needs as the others, who are children.  A high schooler lives a different life than a child.  You need a quiet room where you can study, and with toddlers screaming and playing it'll be impossible to concentrate.  You have nice things- makeup, clothes, computers, games (whatever you have) that are important to you and aren't for children to play with.  And as a teenage girl you have a legitimate need for some privacy, which you won't get sharing a room with toddlers.  \nSo you need them to understand you are not being obstinate, you are not trying to stop the merging of families, and you don't want to cause a problem.  But you don't want to be in a situation where your needs come last or are totally ignored, and that's what you feel is happening here.  \nSo you again propose- you will happily move to the smallest room.  You will move all the stuff yourself.  You will help the kids get settled into your old room.  And you'll try to be a good big sister.  But that can only happen if you have a say in this conversation.  If the answer is that what you want doesn't matter and the middle kids get their own rooms while you don't, then the only conclusion for you is that you're getting the short end of the stick, so you'll leave.  It's not what you want to do, but you will have no choice as sharing a room with toddlers is not an environment where you can study or live in.  \nYou really hope they reconsider and sit down with you to find a solution that works for everybody.  But if not you've got to leave- not because you want to, but because it's the only way for you to successfully get through the rest of high school.", "This doesn't even make sense I am a parent of two and have no idea who in their right mind would even suggest that.

Your father is awful for letting Hannah treat you this way.", "NTA\n\na teen shouldn't be sharing with 3 toddlers. \n\nFor privacy and for safety.\n\nThere's so many inappropriate or dangerous things in a teens room that a toddler could get into.\n\nAdd on top of that that it's your primary residence, you will have homework and socialisation to do. You'll basically be changing your life to fit three toddlers sleep schedules. You'll have to move/hide/get rid of your belongings for their safety. You'll become de facto toddler settler if they wake at night. (Which I personally think is a huge factor in what Hanna wants)\n\nAnd here's a thought: would your dad be so insistent that it would be appropriate if you were male? Or is it only ok because you're female and already having sexist roles thrown onto you for the benefit of another? E.g. would it be appropriate for 3 toddlers to have to witness a 16M change? Because if it isn't, it shouldn't be for you either. Trust me 2 becomes 3 real fast and they notice everything. My daughter was 3 when she publicly asked me why I have to use butt stickers. We were queuing in the busiest store in Manchester (UK) and she asked at the top of her voice. She had caught a glimpse of me changing in my bedroom that morning in a rush. I thought she was watching videos on my phone whilst I sorted myself out. That lack of privacy is invasive even when it's your own child not even to mention 3 that certainly do not belong to you. \n\nYou having 3 toddlers dumped on you isn't blending your family. It's going to make you absolutely miserable and unless Hanna really is attempting to manipulate you into moving or she really wants you to become the night nanny to the toddlers, her plan makes zero sense. The other two sharing and you taking smallest room makes the most sense. Second to that her and your dad should be sharing with the toddlers.. not you. \n\nPlease do not feel bad for Hanna being upset. It's genuinely the oldest manipulation tactic in the world and I hope your dad sees that too. They are both clearly in the relatively early stages of a serious relationship (her having 3 two year olds that aren't his shows that) and her acting like this so early on, over her ridiculous request, is a huge red flag for what's to come. I fear her wants will now be prioritised over your needs, especially if your dad is more angry that Hanna cried than the fact that you're seriously considering moving out. That's a bad start to this whole blended family thing. I hate to be a downer but it really does happen all the time. \n\nI think you really REALLY need to show your dad these responses and if he doesn't budge I'd really be considering the move if I was in your position. In fact, I'd be moving anyway. I feel like this could be lose-lose for you. You win, Hanna resents you. She wins, you'll be past miserable. The only way it would work is if your dad intervenes immediately and opens healthy communication and actually listens to your points vs hanna's. Why exactly does she need you to share with the triplets? What makes a 16yr olds privacy and autonomy less important than a 9yr olds? Then hear out your side and these comments. I hope he has enough sense to actually be reasonable here. \n\nI'd also be honest with your extended family in this situation. Paternal grandparents, aunts, cousins, everyone, but in particular the female ones because I'm sure they'll see the immediate sexist red flags (you know the whole forced night time childcare thing) and they may be able to knock a little sense into your dad. \n\nFuck Hanna's crocodile tears. That's been your house much longer than hers and she's being ridiculously unreasonable.", "I'd throw an accusation of seismic in Dad's face as well. Why do the boys get their own bedrooms but OP who's older has to share a room with the babies? What kind of father does that?

Hell, would he notice if she changed her surname to Mom's?", "I think they want you to move out.\n\nIs it even legal for you to share with 3 toddlers. Particularly 3 who aren\u2019t related to you?", "NTA. It's sad that out of the adults in your home you are being the most reasoned and rational.\n\nAs a child of divorce myself, who was put into a similarly awkward position, take this opportunity to move in with Mom.\n\nTheir logic is bizarre at minimum and forces you to be the primary carer for 3x toddlers at worst.\n\nIf it does change custody agreement (legally) as it did it my case, make sure the court know that you proposed a solution  whereby you agreed to take the smallest room to remain there, so that they know you have tried to be reasonable. \n\nI'm also sorry that this might have an effect on your relationship with your Dad.

I can\u2019t imagine how moving some furniture around would be too much work. This solution also future-proofs, as it will allow more space for the triplets as they get older. One of the other step-siblings could then take your room after you move out. When my step-mom and dad moved in together, there were seven kids in total that needed to be sorted. I was the only one who shared a room with a step-sibling, but it was an arrangement that was discussed and I was fine with. At your age, it should be possible for your dad and step-mom to have a civilized dialogue with you about living arrangements.
