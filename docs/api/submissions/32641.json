Even in 2009, the split was still 60-40 so it would've taken every Democratic Senator to vote yes to codify abortion rights into law. It was never brought to the floor because they never had the votes to actually pass it.", "Never say they was, I was talking about parents in general.", "You can believe you will be different if you are in the same situation.  There will be many things that come at you that lead to that gendered expectation of who labors where.\n\nOf course, no one was expecting me to jump right up after an emergency c-section.  It's what happens in deciding how long your leave is going to be.  Are you breastfeeding?  For how long?\n\nWhile I still consider myself damn lucky that I could stay home with our first child for six months, it had consequences.  That first month, you're physically, emotionally, and mentally recovering, particularly if you went through any birthing trauma.  We had both grandmothers step in for assistance, as paternity leave wasn't really a thing back then.  He had very little time off.\n\nThose next five months, you are both learning to interact with your baby AND do all the stuff related to household maintenance.  Some of them fall more naturally to the partner not doing paid work: doctor's appointments, errands that have to happen during business hours, phone calls to vendors and repair people, calling around on daycares...  It goes on and on and it sets a precedent that is hard to overcome when you go back to work.\n\nWhere is daycare?  Along your route, or your partner's?  Who does daycare/school call EVERY FRIGGING TIME, even when you've said \"I'm working.  He has two parents.  Please call him.\" many times in the past.  Who do doctor's call to schedule visits?  You.  You are who they are used to seeing and who will already have all the information in their brain.\n\nWho will family ask about scheduling visits?  You.  Because you are the one who knows if it's convenient in all the other ways that aren't your spouse's job.\n\nIt's insidious and relentless, and it's not entirely your partner's fault.  You just get tired of challenging every little thing.  But you probably should, because people begin making assumptions they really want to make anyway.\n\nA lot of this stuff isn't AITA territory.  It's constant mindfulness.  It's political.  It's biological (which becomes political and economic).  You have to fight it all the time.  Your partner has to fight it all the time.  Do you want to fight all the time?  I don't.  Most people don't.  So everything keeps slipping into those expected roles over time.\n\nDo men have a bigger role to play in changing this than women do?  Yes.  Because those in power are more likely to listen to men.  It's why a lot of us older ladies bring our sons or husbands to doctor's appointments.  It sucks.  But it's been that way for a very long time.", "Having the votes is beside the point.  It should have been a nationwide discussion.  Politicians' feet should have been held to the fire.  Where did they really fall on the issue?", "So, replies on reddit in a thread work like a conversation. The first person says something, and then the second person replies with something related to their comment, like an answer.\n\nIf the second person wants to talk about something unrelated to what the first person said, they start their own thread.", ">While I still consider myself damn lucky\n\nBased on the fact you have lived a life that lead to you thinking the shit you are spouting is normal you really really shouldn't. You have my pity. And my hope that one day you realise you deserve it."]}
