That would have told you whether or not your mother and sister are worth half the effort they demand.", "Nta your.sister.is.being unsympathetic to your husband's medical situation.", "NTA.\n\nSkip all three events, take care of your husband (and yourself), and enjoy a quiet few holiday days.", "Respectfully, people like her sister\u2026 some of us - most of us do not act like entitled brats, because we are trying to raise our kids not to be entitled brats."]}
