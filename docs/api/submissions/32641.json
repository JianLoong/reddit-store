My husband and I try to make it a point to spend individual time with one of them a month, and we see them all during birthdays, some holidays, etc.\n\nMy mother and sister do not work. All of the kids are either in school or in daycare (including in the summers), and my parents watch all of the kids two days a weekend of my sister's choice. This is relevant because when they're making plans and invite my husband and I, they forget that we both work (but my husband is currently working from home because he shattered his arm and is currently in a full cast and sling, waiting for another surgery which will be on December 27th.) They'll be like, \"we're taking the little ones to see Paw Patrol Thursday at 1, can you both come, they'd love to see you\" then when I say we'll be working they'll ask if we can \"just request off\". \n\nAnyway, my parents just finalized plans to have two larger holiday get-togethers (one with each side of their extended families) plus a smaller holiday get-together with just them, my sister and her husband, me and my husband, and the kids. The two larger gatherings are scheduled for the 20th and 21st, the smaller gathering for the evening of the 22nd, and then we are traveling to see my husband's family the 23rd - 26th. For the first two they rented a gathering space that's an hour away from us. Additionally, relatives on both sides offered to host but my parents insisted on the gathering space because it's more convenient for my sister because she has 4 kids to shuttle around. Everyone in the family is chipping in to cover the cost of the rental space.\n\nI asked if they could come to our house for the private gathering, as it would be easier for us because we both work that day and my husband has a doctor's appointment in the afternoon. Initially they said yes, but today they said it will be at their house because, again, it's easier for my sister and the kids. I expressed my frustration and said she's not the only one who is busy and it's unfair that everything is always made to convenience her, even at the inconvenience of others. My husband and I agreed we will bring our gifts for them and the kids to the larger gatherings and skip the smaller one. They asked if we could request just off on the 22nd. We said no.\n\nThey're now saying we're both being unsympathetic (because my husband is agreeing with me and it was his idea to skip) and that \"we don't know how hard it is because we don't have kids.\" My sister especially is saying I'm being an AH and she feels like I'm trying to say I'm more important because I work, which I'm not.
