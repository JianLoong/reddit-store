A phone or two, a laptop or tablet I could understand(for a bit) and forgetting to switch them over. But adding everything....nah bro\n\nNTA OP. We're it me though, I'd go to my router configuration and filter by Mac address and set traffic priority. Downgrade all their devices to the lowest priority and set a bandwidth limit for their device lists, or simply block a bunch of sites they use. E.g. Facebook, Instagram, the hub....\n\nConsider it malicious compliance. They are still connected, but don't understand why it's so slow. You can leave them connected with minimal impact. They can't raise it with you about it being slow without giving it away they are still connected. You don't need to explain anything or disconnect them so no need for a confrontation at all. \n\nSimply make it unusable for them as an experience and they'll leave and go back to their own WiFi. \n\nIt's the same thing phone services do when you call customer support, you think they NEED to have that insufferable muzaq with the audio quality of an aircraft in a tunnel and variable music volumes?\n\nIt's specifically by design to weed out people as it's cheaper to drive people away than have operators answer the calls and resolve things. In the modern age with the bandwidth we have, there is no reason to have 28kbps quality with static over it. \n\nJust make enough static on the WiFi it drives them off. \n\nIf someone ballsy enough says anything, respond with \"yeah it's been slow for me too, I guess that's how companies get you, good at the start then goes to shit\" like there is nothing you can do.", "It gets even more fishy when you consider that something like a PS5 wasn't even going to be usable until the power returned.

You change your password.This will trigger them to either ask you what happened, in which you say \"I just like to change my passwords occasionally for security. I had no idea you were still connected.\" and then you can either negotiate their usage into your rent/bill, or you just don't give them the new password.Or you change your password and nothing happens.This would be the easiest way to address it.

Almost any power outage that killed their internet would have killed yours as well. They didn't lose power, they just cancelled their internet to mooch off yours.
