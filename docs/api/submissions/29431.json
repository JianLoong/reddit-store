I moved from my home country to live with him in Japan since then. He is a Japanese and have a stable job there, in the other hand I am a freelance illustrator so I am okay to move here.\n\nEveryday I use English with him, maybe you notice already but English is not my first language, so it is not perfect, so is my husband\u2019s English, but at least we can communicate. I tried my best to learn Japanese to be able to communicate with his friends and family, but Japanese is not an easy language. I have to learn how to read Kanji, Hiragana, and Katakana from zero by myself.\n\nDuring the covid (2020), we got money from the government and he bought me some books and dictionaries, telling me to learn the language more intensively during the lock down\u2026 He didnt teach me anything though, he said, since I could speak 4 languages, adding one more language should be easy for me.\n\nI tried. But it is never good enough for him, he always said my grammar sucks. But I do always have problem with grammar, as you can see my English grammar sucks too\u2026\n\nHe said I should be able to speak like a native at this point. So last year (summer 2022) I decided that I would get a part time job at a restaurant so that I can practice more of my Japanese. To my surprise, the staffs there like me and they can understand my Japanese, I also now could read and write several Kanjis (I could write my own address with Kanjis and read menus)\n\nLast week, we have a family dinner with his family\u2026. During the dinner, I made some grammar mistake which was not actually quite bad because everybody still understand what I was trying to say, but my husband says in front of my family, I was stupid for not understanding the correct grammar.\n\nIt makes me upset because he said it in front of everyone so I said in English \u201cyour English is not better than me; and you cant speak my language, why you call me stupid?\u201d\n\nHe was so pissed off and wont talk to me since that day. AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nHe is not a bad guy, I love him so much. Just he is very outspoken. If he disliked something he would say it right away.\n\nHe never comment about my body or looks, but he is very sensitive about my skill\u2026 he often criticized my art style and other skill.\n\nHe said I am lazy\u2026. There is no excuse not to master the language since I am living here for almost 6 years already.\n\n\nMaybe this is me trying to defend myself but last year I got my N3 /JLPT (Japan Language Proficiency Test) Level 3 certification, he said it must be out of luck because my Japanese very rough. And he said I should have gotten the Level 1 already because I am here for so long\u2026.", "created_utc": 1697948129, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dkxa1/aita_for_not_speaking_japanese_after_living_here/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if you understand multiple languages doesn\u2019t mean learning another is any easier. He definitely should\u2019ve helped you too. I think what hindered you overall is not practicing. From the sound of it once you got that part time and was forced to speak more your Japanese improved. So honestly he should\u2019ve spoken more Japanese at home. Also curious if he\u2019s making any effort to speak your native tongue?", "NTA. \n\nYou *do* speak Japanese. I thought you meant you didn't ever speak any at all from your title. You just don't speak perfect Japanese. \n\nYour husband is being a jerk and refusing to even help you. \n\nOn top of that, you speak FOUR other languages. Don't put up with that from him.", "NTA and your English is excellent.  Your husband is TA for humiliating you in front of his family.  I've learned that no matter where on the planet I am, natives to those areas are extremely forgiving if I make an attempt.  My french is horrifying and my german is worse, but the maximum anyone has ever done is gently teach me the proper way of what I'm actually trying to say.  Most of the time, people get the general idea and we continue on.", "NTA\n\nHe didn\u2019t need to humiliate you in front of everyone", "NTA. That's a horrible thing to do to a person you love. He doesn't love you. He doesn't like you. He has contempt for you.", "NTA. Languages are hard. You have made an huge effort and gotten further than most ever would in learning the language. Your husband needs to accept that you aren't a native speaker, and the intricacies of Japanese grammar are difficult to outsiders. Whatever slight he thinks you are making doesn't sound like it matters to others. This is his problem, not yours.", "You don't have a language problem, you have a husband problem. He's a jerk who thinks he's superior, humiliates you in front of other people and completely decimates your abilities and self esteem.\n\nAs an aside - I learned Italian within months. Why? Because it's similar to the languages I already speak. I find it easy to pick up French, Spanish and even German. \n\nJapanese would take me forever. It's not similar in any way. His attitude is grotesque.", "NTA\n\nFor \"not speaking Japanese\"?  If you speak Japanese well enough to work as a server, you *do* speak Japanese.  \n\nYou speak 5 languages - and your English is good, btw.  He doesn't speak *your* native language at all, after 6 years of marriage.\n\nYou were surprised that your coworkers could understand you, but they can just fine.  Was your primary feedback on that matter before that point your husband?  Did he tell you nobody would understand you?  And, again, your English is not bad at all.  So I wonder who told you that your English is weak, was that your husband, too?\n\nDoes he often undermine and belittle and even publicly humiliate you?  Does he do things to discourage you from speaking to other people generally, or suggest that they'll reject you?\n\nRegardless, what he did at dinner is a really crappy way to treat you.  You deserve better than that.", "NTA a thousand times NTA!!!!\n\nYou can COMMUNICATE just fine with those around you. How is that not good enough? What the hell is your husband's problem? \n\nI'm from a part of the USA with a lot of people speaking different languages. I'm learning my second language and my grammar is bad. I'm sure my grammar in my second language is far worse than your grammar in English. (I think your grammar is pretty good! You communicate perfectly!) But you know what? I communicate okay and I'm not ashamed of where I am right now. I'll only be getting better as I continue to practice. \n\nI'm certain that you will get better too, because why wouldn't you? You're surrounded by native speakers! It's *inevitable* that you will improve!\n\nYour husband is being so mean, ungenerous, and overall just nasty to you when everyone around you simply doesn't care because you communicate just fine. He's just upset because you pointed out that his English isn't perfect. What a hypocrite!", "NTA. I was also married to someone living in another country that used another language. I learned it slowly and made mistakes (also does not use the English alphabet). His parents loved the fact that I tried and he never called me stupid. That is a terrible thing to say to a loved one regardless of how much or how little you have tried or can speak. Your husband is a huge AH for humiliating you.", "nta your husband is a prick", "NTA. Your husband is emotionally abusive.", "NTA, and your English is fine! English grammar can be extremely weird, and you get across what you seem to want to say. Your husband is a real piece of work to critisise you and yet never try to help you. And he refuses to learn your language even though he can't communicate with your parents because of it? That doesn't seem like a healthy relationship to me.", "NTA.\n\nThis guy must be incredible in some way for you to put up with this disrespect and rudeness, but I can't imagine what it is.", "Huge Nta. If your husband is so mad about you not being able to pick up Japanese in a damn day, why can't he just help you with it? He's the one getting mad at you when you are trying your best to learn a language and the least he could do is try and support you during it and help you. And Japanese is a hard language so take your time in learning it and I hope you get the hang of it soon :)", "NTA bit your husband sure is. He won't he l p you learn Japanese, criticizes you for not being perfect yet expects your Japanese to be perfect. He's a controlling dick.", "NTa... but he is super sensitive to your weak Japanese.\n\nTell him Japanese is one of the most difficult languages for speaker to learn and he needs to be more patient.\n\nYou can also tell him that scientists have proven affirmation, or being positive about language helps 100% of people learn faster than constant correction.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Most natives don't care as long as you communicate and get your point across. And if you don't, they'll work with you to understand.\n\nThere is no excuse for the absolute mean-spiritedness of OP's husband.

The manager even want me to be the full time employee there and he always gave me bonus every month for my hard work.

Grammatical errors are no big deal, he is being a rude idiot.", "Your husband is an asshole, it's one rule for him and another for you. He doesn't respect you as he should. \n\nAlso, as someone who speaks multiple languages, with Japanese as a non-native being one of them, grammar mistakes can happen any time. Even natives can make them. Already knowing other languages, while maybe helping a little, doesn't make picking up another language easy peasy. \n\nIf you've been learning Japanese intensely for just a few years but can communicate pretty well (and with little help from natives for the majority of this time) you've done really well. Don't let him dump on your confidence. I'd dump him first tbh.", "You, unfortunately, have a husband issue.\n\nYou're clearly a very smart person who rapidly improved in your fifth language once you had opportunity to practice (which your husband did not give you). You're an artist! A polyglot! You're amazing. However, your husband won't put in a fraction of the effort you did to engage in your language or to help improve your language skills.

The purpose is to stop you from thinking you deserve to be treated decently. Moreover, his chosen target keeps you dependent on him, unable to form connections with the poeple around you, or even his family, keeps you from getting a job, and even seeking help.

Also, refusing to talk to you when you were simply defending yourself is not the actions of a loving partner. Based on your post, you seem to be in an emotionally abusive relationship. You do speak Japanese and it seems like you are on the road to mastering the language. Continue to lean on the community you have created at your job and you will be fluent sooner than you think. Also, you should really assess your relationship with your husband; it doesn't seem healthy and he clearly doesn't respect you.", "I am full Asian and sometimes mistaken as a Japanese\u2026 But aside from my husband, everybody never really complained about my Japanese\u2026. Just when I moved to Japan they got confused a little but if I phrased something wrong\u2026", "Interesting! I'd never heard of Mexico when it comes to being unforgiving about language, but given the differences between Mexican Spanish and other kinds of Spanish, maybe that has something to do with it?"]}
