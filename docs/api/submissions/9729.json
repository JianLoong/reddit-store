Smart move!", "NTA\n\nYour sister\u2019s feelings can be hurt but I fail to see how this broke her trust.   This is the direct result of her past behavior and treatment of people.", "NTA - your sister sounds horrible, I wouldn't want her near me.", "NTA. You are being a good husband to your wife by protecting her from your sister\u2019s horrible attitude. You did not break any trust with your sister, it is actually the other way round.", "NTA. her pattern of behavior at family Events is unacceptable.  She did not get the attention She seeks by acting out at your wedding, so she is acting out in this way after the fact.  She may need therapy for a personality disorder.", "NTA. If everyone in the family can't stand her, remind her of this fact and that it's her own damn fault. Play stupid games, etc.", "NTA. Your sister has shown who she is. She can deal with the consequences.", "NTA - wow, she sounds like a lovely woman /s", "NTA. Your sister fucked around at another wedding; now she is bearing the consequences", "NTA - Your sister sounds like quite the narcissist.  I don't blame you for not wanting to deal with her shenanigans on what is supposed to be a happy day.  She's going to make drama regardless, but better after that during.  She can ride the guilt-trip train and get all kinds of mileage dragging this out but you don't have to participate.  Ignore it.  And don't worry about what she is saying to other people.  Consider the source.", "NTA. And block your sister. You can contact her when she stops acting like a child.", "NTA - Good that you can recognize toxic behavior of your family and think about protecting your wife", "NTA.

Why should your wedding have been another stage for your sister to steal the spotlight?", "Absolutely positively NTA and good for you! She is manipulative, selfish, disrespectful, lacks empathy, and has main character syndrome!  I would of absolutely not invited her either. Her blowing up your messages trying to gaslight you and cry that you broke her trust is exactly prime example that she gives NO shits about anyone but herself!!", "NTA.  Your sister is facing the natural consequences of her actions.  Your poor cousin!   I  wouldn't want her around, either!", "Nta. She's crying because she's not the center of attention, that's all.
