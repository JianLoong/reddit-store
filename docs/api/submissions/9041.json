Your aunt can dish it out but she clearly can\u2019t take it.", ">Even my cousin said it was a bad move, because it didn't help Zee, just gave me a sense of moral superiority.\n\nI'm not sure your cousin is right, here. If Zee is anxious about the test, it's possible that you relieved a little bit of her anxiety. You're helping Zee through practice. NTA.", "*Very technically speaking* you were **an** asshole, but I still think **THE** asshole was your aunt. \n\nSo, **NTA**. \n\nShe should know well enough not to cast stones when she can't even come close to meeting the standards that she's mocking someone about.", "Omg that was epic. NTA.\n\n I would apologise to the aunt to keep the peace, but I would likely also pointedly ask her if she felt angry and upset and the comment, then when she says yes ask her how she thinks Zee feels, pregnant, in a foreign country where she doesn't know if she'll be able to stay, and her MIL making hurtful comments to her.", "NTA, unless you really leaned in on mocking her in a mean way.  It was a good experience for her to see that she herself could barely pass, after nearly making Zee cry.", ">my cousin said it was a bad move, because it didn't help Zee, just gave me a sense of moral superiority.\n\n\nSo, your cousin is correct. But still NTA. Your aunt brought it on herself.", "So in the grand scheme of things, NTA and that was an absolutely perfect line!\n\nThat said, I'd defer to your cousin for the purpose of family harmony - maybe a backhanded \"apology\" if it'll calm things down.", "NTA, your aunt is though. Those tests are hard, I did one once for my own country and I failed!!! haha, anyway, your aunt is not supportive at all and I think humble pie is exactly what she needed :-)", "NTA. This is a clear case of what is good for the goose is good for the gander. And, as for the people criticizing you for what you did: where where they when your aunt was bullying Zee?", "She got the teasing she deserved. Don't feel bad about it. Have another test ready  next time you see her.. NTA", "NTA at all \ud83d\ude2d in fact there are some other acronyms i could give you; GOAT, BAMF, etc", "NTA. A perfect response to an AH.", "They're wrong. It did help Zee.\n\nShowing in quantifiable terms that she is in fact smarter than the person telling her she's stupid is an excellent way to prove that she shouldn't worry about what they think.", "ESH \n\n\nI was on your side at the beginning, but it seems like you made your cousin and Zee both very upset and uncomfortable. You can insult your aunt and walk away, because you aren't really involved in this, but it seems like Zee is trying very hard to do this, as well as toe the line with her MIL, and this seems like it might just make your aunt more vitriolic rather than humble her.", "NTA.", "Your cousin isn't wrong. You took the low road and likely further degraded your aunt's relationship with Zee. People like your aunt will often punish those who witness their humiliation, and although Zee may appreciate that someone stood up for her it could've probably been handled in a manner that chastised your aunt without making Zee even more of a target. \n\nThat said...well played. I salute your willingness to defend Zee, and your aunt sounds like a massive AH who deserves the shit out of this. \n\nYTA, but I'd still shake your hand and buy you a congratulatory  beer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your cousin can't stick up to mommy, he isn't ready to be a husband or a father.", "NTA.\n\nI would have asked the aunt where she plans on moving to.", "We need a \u201cjustified asshole\u201d tag. Your behavior was not, shall we say, above reproach \u2014 but everyone else in your family is a total dingus for not standing up to your xenophobic aunt. (Zee is of course in the clear.) So YTA but I would\u2019ve been, too. All aboard the SS Asshole!!", "Kind of an asshole move, but ultimately NTA. Your xenophobic aunt needed to be set straight, and you did just that.", "NTA..  I'm American and not sure I could pass the test...  Cousins wife should be proud of herself", "NTA.  Your aunt doesn't like Zee and thinks bullying her is okay.  I very much doubt she would stop bullying Zee without someone making her stop.   Thank you for sticking up for Zee.  It's too bad your dad complained to you, although I very much doubt he got the whole story from your aunt.", "INFO- what does Zee say?\n\nYour aunt needed to get told off. But your cousin could be correct that you didn't help Zee. Being a dick to a xenophobic asshole is easier and feels more immediately satisfying than supporting their victims, but you run the risk of making things worse for them. If Zee agrees with her husband that your actions made it worse, I'll give you a gentle E S H, but if she appreciated you standing up for her, NTA. Either way, your intentions were good and you made a good point, and your aunt was the worst asshole.", "YTA, but for a worthwhile cause. Yes, you really did nothing to raise up Zee but:\n\n1. Your aunt willingly took the test\n2. She already was being insensitive\n3. All you did was throw her own words in her face. If she didn't think they were rude, it wouldn't have hurt.\n\nShe was an asshole, you knew it and still did almost exactly as she did. Does make YTA, but for good reason, and cousin should have already defended his fiance before it even got there.", "I've taken part in several citizenship tests when a friend or a celebrity has done it.

She's convinced she's going to fail, even though she definitely won't.", "Hell, almost all natural born Americans will definitely do worse than her. 1 question wrong? Don't matter, she got this."]}
