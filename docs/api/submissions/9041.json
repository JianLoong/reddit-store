I'm American and not sure I could pass the test...  Cousins wife should be proud of herself", "NTA.  Your aunt doesn't like Zee and thinks bullying her is okay.  I very much doubt she would stop bullying Zee without someone making her stop.   Thank you for sticking up for Zee.  It's too bad your dad complained to you, although I very much doubt he got the whole story from your aunt.", "INFO- what does Zee say?\n\nYour aunt needed to get told off. But your cousin could be correct that you didn't help Zee. Being a dick to a xenophobic asshole is easier and feels more immediately satisfying than supporting their victims, but you run the risk of making things worse for them.

It was for your pleasure mostly. I get the irony but did it really helped anyone...will ur aunt stop being rude...will ur cousin start to defend his wife. Will his wife feel better about herself not sure. Because of this. Not sure. I do give lesson like this sometimes the person need to be put in the other person shoes...but after doing so I would say see: do you realise now how this feel? And try to get the other person to learn something out if this. It is ok that you did that but for sure no one in your family was about to praise that. Own up to what you did and let your father know why you did it. And maybe talk to your cousin why isnt he speaking regarding that matter. Don't get me wrong it is very funny this situation could be in a comedy about a dysfunctionnal family. But not everyone will enjoy it hahahah", "Eh, she fucked around and found out. NTA.", "NTA.  But I'll bet OP didn't do that great on the test either.", "Justified YTA but like not really. She needed to stop giving the woman a hard time.

There's a bank of questions, they ask 10, you have to get 6 right.

Saying that, I did get a question that was asking about important folks in the War of 1812, and one of the multiple choice answers was Wayne Gretzky.
