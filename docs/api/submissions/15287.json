{"id": 15287, "submission_id": "12tfszz", "title": "AITA for forcing my daughter to share a birthday celebration with her twin brother?", "selftext": "I have two kids, Paige (14/F) and Dylan (14/M). As twins most years they\u2019ve wanted to have a joint birthday celebration, but there have been a couple of years where they\u2019ve decided to have separate parties with different friend groups or at different locations. They tell me a few weeks before their birthday in May which thing they want to do that year. \n\nSo this year Paige told me that she and Dylan had decided they wanted to have their own parties, and she and her friends had already picked a whole theme and the activities that they wanted to do. I approved Paige\u2019s plan, and then a day or so later I asked Dylan what he wanted to do for his birthday party.\n\nAt this point I learned that Dylan and Paige had *not* mutually decided that they were having separate celebrations this year, and me asking Dylan about it was the first he was hearing that he was expected to have his own party. His feelings were very hurt that Paige had cut him out without so much as talking to him about it.\n\nSo I spoke with Paige and she admitted that she and her friends had decided on their own to exclude Dylan because they felt that a boy would wreck the activities they had planned. I told Paige that it wasn\u2019t okay for her to treat her brother that way and that the party I\u2019d originally agreed to was now cancelled, and that I expected her and Dylan to plan a joint birthday celebration with activities that all of their friends could enjoy.\n\nDylan is much happier with this arrangement, but Paige is angry and keeps saying that I ruined her party. I\u2019m worried that I might\u2019ve made a misstep because normally I try very hard to treat my kids as individuals and not just as a pair of twins, and I\u2019m worried that forcing Paige to share her birthday celebration with Dylan might send the wrong message on that front.

I\u2019ve never been a teen boy but I have been a teen girl and I remember how insanely close I was with my friends and all the crazy fun girl things we did together that we would have been horrified to share with boys. Let her have the party she wants. They are two separate people. \n\nI\u2019m also wondering - Why is it so important to your son to have the party together? Does he have friends of his own?", "YTA.  They're teens now.  It's completely reasonable that she wants her own party.  And frankly it should be default at this point that they have separate parties.  She should be able to have her own party without her brother's permission.", "Yta and how exactly do you see this working out?  She isn't going to plan, she isn't going to participate; you'll be lucky if she shows up.  It's really going to end up a party for your son and no party for your daughter. \n\n\nThey are two separate people.  The *default* should be seperate.", "YTA. The girl planned a party for herself and her friends. The boy failed to do so. Now the girl is forced to put together another party to accommodate the boy. And this is where girls learn that the world (even their mom) expects them to carry the emotional labor.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re very clearly favoring Dylan by only allowing the plan he is happy about. Have fun intentionally ruining Paige\u2019s birthday and inevitably making Dylan\u2019s worse too because she\u2019ll resent him. This kind of parenting mistake poisons sibling relationships. Let them have separate parties and help your son plan something he will enjoy.", "YTA for forcing a joint party. That could lead to your daughter turning her anger at you towards her brother. \n\nHave repercussions for lying and not talking to her brother ahead of time. Don\u2019t turn having a joint birthday party into a punishment.", "YTA for forcing them to share birthdays. They don\u2019t need to mutually decide to have them separately. This is an individual decision and it\u2019s ridiculous to force them to share just be sure Dylan wants to.", "YTA she should have a minor punishment (not forcing the parties together) for lying and not discussing it with her brother. \n\nHowever, OP is partially at fault if they make her feel obligated to share. I don\u2019t understand why she wouldn\u2019t have just told her brother she wants them separate again. Is she afraid of something? Or was she trying to blindside him for kicks?", "YTA.  There comes a time when boys' and girls' interests heavily diverge, and then a few years later, they'll converge again.  Your daughter is at a stage in life where she and her friends want to do girl stuff on her birthday, and having a bunch of boys at the celebration would kill the vibe.  I don't know why Dylan has a say in how Paige decides to celebrate her birthday.  Of course Dylan is happier with this arrangement because he got his way, and you've forced your daughter to invite him and his friends to her party.  Imagine how you would have felt at fourteen if you'd been forced to celebrate your birthday party with your sibling's friends.", "No birthday party at all would be way over the top. Your enthusiasm here is really telling. How often do you find yourself blatantly favoring Dylan or just choosing harsher punishments for Paige? Don\u2019t fuck around with kids\u2019 birthdays. You can\u2019t undo it and it\u2019s a bad look for you that sticks around. Based on your post and your comments I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019ve been slowly chipping away at their sibling relationship for a long time.", "YTA - You've got two issues here. To have a joint party or not, and the fact Paige lied. \nThe joint party should only happen if BOTH kids enthusiastically want it. That doesn't mean they can't invite the other twins friends to their own party. But it's a two YES, one NO situation. Also, they don't have to have a PARTY. They can have a day out, a day of doing what they want at home, a day of hobbies, etc. If Dylan isn't the most social person, he doesn't have to go through with a PARTY if he doesn't want to. \nPaige should face some sort of consequence for lying, but first I would be more interested in finding out WHY she lied. Why can't she discuss this with her brother? Why is Dylan so much happier with a joint party? Until you've gotten to the bottom of that, hold off on the consequences for the lies.", ">They tell me a few weeks before their birthday in May which thing they want to do that year. \n\nINFO: what occurs when one doesn't want a joint party or there's disagreements about guests/activities etc? Also who usually does most of the planning of the joint parties? Is it equal or does Paige handle a lot of the details?", "YTA - They should only have a joint party if they both want a joint party not the other way around.", "INFO: Have you asked Paige *why* she lied to you about coming to an agreement with Dylan about their birthday? If she had come to you and just said \"hey mom, I don't want to have a joint party this year\" but Dylan had wanted one... how would you have handled it? Does the mutual agreement actually matter here? \n\nThe lying obviously isn't great but I really need to understand the why of it a bit better before passing judgement.", "YTA. You have it completely backwards. The default should be that Paige gets her own birthday party unless they decide together to have a joint party. \nYou owe Paige an apology for making her feel like she did something wrong by wanting to celebrate her birthday with her friends. Paige deserves autonomy.", "Paige should have been able to say that she wants her own party and that should have then been the end of it- individual parties, no problem done and dusted. The fact that she lied tells me that Paige probably feels Dylan would have gotten his way, her feelings would have been ignored and you would have forced her to share a party. So YTA for that reason and it\u2019s something you need to work on. Unless you think she lied just to be malicious?", "It sounds to me that Paige's only mistake was that she didn't tell her brother before she started making plans. She's 14, so I give her a pass for being avoidant, though obviously you should tell her she should not repeat that, and actually communicate. Like, what if she told Dylan from the start she wanted separate parties and he said he wanted a mutual one. It would not be reasonable to force a mutual party on her under those circumstances, so it does not make sense to me to force her to now, just because Dylan was blind-sided. So, yes, I'm afraid YTA.", "YTA, they are two individual people. If one person is opposed to sharing a birthday, then they should get their own. She does not need her brothers permission to have her own celebration because it doesn't impact him as long as he gets his own as well. YTA, she's going to resent you if you keep celebrating them as a set and not as their own person.", "YTA she's a teenager, it's expected for her to want independence. Dylan is valid in being sad but forcing her to share the party is an AH move.", "YTA \n\nNot leaving much space for individualism if you force them to have joint parties. They are now teenagers and Paige clearly wants to do her own thing.", "YTA.  I understand wanting to teach her to be considerate of your son, but at this age the default shouldn't be a joint party unless they both agree to individuals, it should be separate parties unless they both agree to a joint party.  At 14 they are trying to figure out who they are and exert independence, and it's even harder for a twin to do that.  By all means, have a discussion with her about being considerate of her brother's feelings and how she could have handled the situation better, but taking her party away as a punishment is cruel and an overreaction.", "YTA - it's hard enough for twins to be seen as an individual without you adding fuel to the fire.", "YTA Your kids are individuals and should not be forced to share birthday parties.  My brother and I were born a day apart yet we (were forced to) share birthday celebrations. \n\nThey are not some generic unit and whether she consulted with him first or not, she made her wishes known and you should respect that.", "YTA - You are not treating them as individuals and you are sending the message to Dylan that his wants and feelings are more important than his sister's.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nI understand being upset that Paige excluded Dylan and she definitely should be forced to apologize. \nBut making the party joint is only going to  cause Dylan to not enjoy it because Paige is definitely gonna make it known she's miserable as well as cause animosity amongst them.", "YTA. They are 14. Let them pick separate parties. \n\nPaige shouldn\u2019t have lied and needs to apologize for it. But the punishment shouldn\u2019t be a joined party.", "YTA, if Dylan wanted a party he should have taken the time to plan one like Paige did. All you did was reaffirm the age old tradition of mothers putting their sons above their daughters. Why should Paige give up her plans because of Dylan? Why can\u2019t he have his own plans?", "They shouldn't have to mutually decide this. It would make more sense for them to have to mutually agree to a joint party. If your daughter wants her own day, she should have it because she's her own person. This is a good opportunity to have your son learn how to regulate disappointment instead of coddling him and divorcing your daughter to accommodate him. I will never understand why parents so heavily favor their songs that daughters have to accommodate constantly. YTA.", "Paige and Dylan are different people. Paige shouldn\u2019t need Dylan\u2019s approval to celebrate her birthday with her friends.", "YTA.  Why does daughter need brother's permission to have separate parties?  Have consequences for lying sure, but this is extreme.  You'll be back on here after this joint party complaining that it was ruined by your daughter sulking and not participating in a party that is supposed to celebrate her, that she didn't want, and is being used as a punishment.  There is no way for this to end well, and it will also hurt your son, who is the only innocent person in this post.", "YTA.\n\nPaige was wrong for lying about her and Dylan agreeing to this. This definitely deserved a conversation and some form of punishment.  However, taking away her party is a case where the punishment does **not** fit the crime.\n\nEdit: Typo and clarity", "As a twin myself,  YTA and i don't understand why you're asking. You said you try to not treat them as a package deal but your daughter didn't want to do things with her friends and her brother.... now you're making her? How do you not see that you're in the wrong.", "Both you and Paige are TA's. \n\nPaige shouldn't have lied. Period. \n\nHowever at 14 it is totally reasonable for her to want her own party. Twins really do often get shortchanged when it comes to having their individuality recognized. She is feeling that. Maybe give her consequences for lying, but allow her her own party. On a purely practical level having a sulking 14yr old girl forced to celebrate her birthday with her brother is not going to make for a very happy party for her brother or anyone else in attendance.", "YTA.\n\nAt 14yo it is normal to want to be your own person.  As they are different genders, it is even more likely that they would want different parties.  Surely, it wasn't a surprise to Dylan that he would be asked this question.\n\nYour decision to cancel Paige's party to accommodate Dylan is not a good look.  Dylan got what he wanted and Paige is being punished.  Guessing Paige now has little interest in a party or celebration of her birthday.  For Paige's lying, maybe not giving her any friend celebration would be more appropriate than making her share it with Dylan.", "YTA.  You are doing the opposite of treating your twins as individuals.  You are also placing a higher value on dylan's feelings than paige's. Probably not the first time.\n\n Why is dylan's want to have a joint party more important than paige's want NOT to have a joint party.", "Info: if Dylan wants a joint party and Paige does not, what do you do?", "YTA. At a certain point even twins need to start separating and I'd say 14 is about the right age. Forcing a mixed party on someone that clearly doesn't want it will create some bad feelings.", "Why is Dylan\u2019s happiness more important to you than Paige\u2019s independence \n\nPaige got into planning her birthday and did so.\nDid Dylan do anything for his?\n\nWhy should she have to check what she wants to do for HER birthday with her sibling/twin\n\nYes she shouldn\u2019t of lied,  but surely there is a better punishment then  in forcing a double party that\u2019s the AH move", "YTA. Yes Paige should of told her brother first but they are teenagers now and need their own individuality. Forcing them to have w joint party is the complete opposite of that. have a talk with both your child; tell your daughter it was wrong to not discuss her feelings with her brother first before going to you about the party. Tell your son you understand why he was upset but this is learning/growing point in his life where he can learn not everything needs or has to be shared with his twin and that this can be his chance to have a party with all of his friends and likes and interests. I wish you all the best", "YTA", "YTA. But Im gona try to help\n\nThis could be a great teaching moment about empathy and acceptance. \n\nFor Paige, its understandable to want space; but in the future, thats her brother and its good to communicate. Ghosting someone is wrong, and lying about it also wrong. But, its ok to want her own party, she just needs to apologize to Dylan that she chose that route. Seems they have had an unspoken routine most times up until now. She doesnt 'owe' her brother her plans like that, but have empathy that, yeah she can understand how Dylan is hurt. \n\nDylan, while understandably hurt by the blindside. Also needs to learn that, his feelings are valid firstly. Second, its also ok she wants to do her own thing and doesnt meant anything different about his relationship with his sister. (Not inferring he was thinking that, more so just incase he is) this year, it'll be separate party's, no worries but at least hes aware and has time to plan his own thing. \n\nPersonally, as a parent myself this is how I would've tried to go about it. Still time to untangle the chaos Op, good luck.\n\nEdited* typos", "Soft YTA. I can\u2019t fathom twins, especially opposite gender twins, but they are 14 and at the point they need to forge identities outside of being twins. It seems Paige is trying to do this while Dylan is not. I\u2019m guessing Paige is outgoing and Dylan is more introverted?", "YTA your prioritizing your sons feelings over your daughters. If you give them the option to have separate parties they shouldnt have to agree on it. You could have talked to her and explained why what she did hurt his feelings and then have her apologize but keep the parties separate. You over corrected and it might cause resentment down the line. I\u2019m (f) a twin with my brother and it was really easy to see the favouritism based on gender.", "Info: previously when they had separate parties whose idea was it? Who brought it up, you? Them?", "YTA for giving them joint celebrations to begin with. They\u2019re separate people, and if they decided to do a joint party, they could decide that on their own. But YOU are setting them up for a bad relationship", "Yep YTA", "YTA. Seems to me like Dylan is learning that he can rely on his sister to do all the work. If you were trying to encourage them to be individuals, how about encourage Dylan to do this for himself instead of glomming onto his sisters plans.", "YTA. It is COMPLETELY reasonable for your teenage daughter to want birthday plans with other girls and not her brother. Sure, she lied, but probably because you wouldn\u2019t have listened if she told you she didn\u2019t care what her brother thinks, she wants something to herself. Why are your son\u2019s feelings more important than your daughter\u2019s? You\u2019ve set up a really sticky dynamic here, tbh.", "YTA your kids may be twins but it\u2019s ok for them to have different friend and activities. Your daughter felt that instead of being honest with you it was best to lie because at least she had a chance to get her on special celebration.\n\nYou are not teaching her a lesson on family first. You are teaching her to resent her brother that she has to share everything with.", "YTA. They're teenagers now, so bound to have their own friends and interests.\n\nPaige is within he right to want a separate party without her brother and she doesn't need to agree with him that's what she wants to do. She could have been more tactful and let him know, but she's not wrong for wanting it.\n\nMaking her share with him when that's not what she wants is only going to make her resent him. It's hard enough for twin to forge their own identities without having to do everything together.", "ESH - Your daughter shouldn't have claimed that she had decided with her brother, if that's what she actually said.  Did she say \"Dylan and I decided...\" or did she just say \"Dylan and I are having separate parties and I know what I want for mine!\"  The second isn't technically a lie, so the exact way she phrased it matter.\n\nThe default for anyone over 3yrs old that shares a birthday with a family member (whether or not they are twins) should be to have separate celebrations.  Your birthday should be your special day.  Have one do the weekend before and the other the weekend after.  That way if they have mutual friends, those friends can attend both parties without needing to choose between the kids.\n\nYou shouldn't have responded by forcing a joint party.  I know some people say that's the penalty for lying, but it's an over reaction if she did lie outright and say she had talked to Dylan and he agreed, and it's completely out of line if she never directly said she had talked with her brother and you had just assumed she had.  Either way, from your daughter's point of view you have told her that her brother's feelings are more important than hers.\n\nA proper punishment for lying (if she did) would be to apologize to her brother and you and have her be responsible for any setup/clean up for _both_ parties.  She made the decision to do two parties on her own, she can do the work for both parties.\n\nBut going forward, the standard should be two parties unless they decide to do something together...in which case both would have to agree to the joint party.  If one twin wants a separate party, they should get it.  They can still attend their siblings party if you have them on different days.", "YTA.   You are correct in your thought that 'forcing Paige to share her birthday celebration with Dylan might send the wrong message on that front.\"   You've dropped the ball here.  Do you really want to do this to Paige?  Really?  You do understand that what you seem to think will happen isn't actually going to happen.  \"Activities that all of their friends could enjoy.\"  Keep telling yourself that lie to make yourself feel better.", "ESH - Paige shouldn\u2019t have excluded Dylan but she also shouldn\u2019t be forced to have a party with her brother and miss out on time with her friends. \nWhy can\u2019t Dylan find something to do separate with his friends? Kinda sounds like Dylan\u2019s missing his sister.", "ESH, except Dylan. Paige should've had a conversation with her brother about this, but teenage boys and teenage girls like VERY different things. Doing a combined birthday party is silly at this point. You say you want to treat them as individuals, but a combined birthday is treating them as twins and nothing more. They will likely both be happier doing their own things for their birthday, Dylan just didn't piece it together as quickly as Paige did.", "ESH besides Dylan.\n\nPaige shouldn't have lied, and there should be consequences.  I think forcing her to share her birthday with Dylan could potentially a) lead to Dylan not enjoying his birthday as much if Paige has a bad attitude about it, essentially punishing him for his sister's lie and/or b) fostering resentment between Paige and Dylan.", "YTA", "I mean... It sounds more like Paige knew Dylan would object and she wouldn't get the party she wanted. \n\nPersonally, I hated having group parties with my brother. Our Birthdays are weeks apart. So it wasn't uncommon our folks would combine parties to save money. But all that stopped after he turned 10. \n\nFYI you did ruin her party. She didn't want to share with Dylan so you forced her to share to punish her. She shouldn't have lied, but you need to start thinking of your twins as individuals with individual wants/needs.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Because a teenage girl wanted to have a girl party but didn't run it past her brother first for his approval, it's canceled?!  Why do I think if the situation was reversed, you would be defending your son's actions to your daughter and he could have the party he planned for himself?  Sounds like your son's feelings mean more to you than your daughter's, \n\nUncancel Paige's party and let her have it as she planned.  Apologize to your daughter.  I think if more parents modeled how to own and rectify their mistakes for their children, we'd have a lot more mature adults and healthier relationships in this world.\n\n#", "YTA.  I'm a twin mom (mine turn 20 in 2 months).  Don't do this.  Not only because they're twins but don't give your daughter (or your son) the impression that she is responsible for managing his social comfort/is in charge of planning for his stuff.  Your son can also plan some a activities for his friends.  Maybe they can do something special for just the two of them besides their birthday gathering with friends.", "YTA. You say you've tried to treat your children as individuals but this shows that's not the case. Your daughter deserves the right to be her own individual person and to have her own party, whether she cleared it with her brother or not. It's not her place to ask permission from her brother to have her own birthday party. But at least Dylan's happy right?", "YTA. Twins, especially a boy and girl,  will eventually want to have their own identity. Having joint birthday parties after a certain age is basically refusing to acknowledge that you see them as individuals. 14 is plenty old enough to have separate celebrations.", "YTA. As an identical twin I have always shared birthdays with my sibling while we lived in the same area, but we\u2019ve always been best friends and had shared friend groups. Being that they are both 14 and have different friend groups, they should probably be having separate parties as now your daughter has made it clear that that\u2019s what she wants. With that being said, I think a sit down with your children would be better and let your daughter know what she did and how she went about communicating it wasn\u2019t  cool. You should definitely not force them to have a joint party though since I guarantee no one will end up happy in that case.", "NTA. The YTA votes are overlooking two key facts. The first is you\u2019ve always given your kids the choice between having a joint party or having individual ones. You don\u2019t force them to have joint parties. The second is that Paige lied to you. She must have known that Dylan wanted a joint party and instead of working it out with him or even asking you to mediate the disagreement, she lied to you to get what she wanted. That\u2019s not ok. If you let her have an individual party, you\u2019ll be teaching her that she can lie and disregard the feelings of others to get her way.", "YTA", "YTA they are 14 now not kids and being a girl and boy they will have different interests and friends. Especially if Paige and her friends are all girls it makes sense why they wouldn\u2019t want boys there. Yes Paige should\u2019ve talked to Dylan . But same goes for Dylan why was he expecting to share a party without talking to his sister. Maybe tell them both to communicate better. Listen to them both and go from there .", "YTA - I\u2019m a fraternal twin and while my sister and I shared a lot of birthdays growing up I would not expect to share them all especially at 14. Your son will get over this and you should not force them to have a party together or they will be miserable.\n\nThe lesson needs to be about communication on both your kids part.", "Why would this \"need\" to be a mutual decision.  Like, I get that it would be good to give her brother a heads up, but you're acting like she needed his permission.  \n\n\nIf she wants to do a party alone, and yeah, of course she does, 14F isn't the same as 14M, obviously, he doesn't need to agree, it's not up to him, he has no say; she doesn't need her brother's permission to not want a joint party, he doesn't have to be on the same page, it doesn't matter, he doesn't get to force a joint party and you are very much the AITA for punishing her here.  She's allowed to make this decision without consulting anyone, a heads up would have been nice, but it's not a punishable offense, she should be gently reminded to be a little more considerate but otherwise, like.... this is her choice, that she should be allowed to make, she told you, the person she had to tell, and that should have been enough.  \n\n\nYTA", "I don't want to call you an AH but you handled this situation wrong.  \n\nSuggestion of it's not to late. Tell them to go into a room and talk and come out with a decision.  The issue here was simply they didn't discuss it together. And instead of having them.discuss it you decided for them.", "I don't understand the Y T A votes.  The issue isn't having shared parties or separate parties.  The issue is that she lied in order to get the separate party. \nNTA.  You can't let her get away with lying.   She needs to learn that she can't lie her way into getting her way.", "ESH, I don't know what your daughter is thinking but it didn't work if she really wanted a separate party as much to warn Dylan from the beginning instead of lying. You are also TA because even if I understand your situation, forcing people to spend time together never works (I know it very well).", "Why didn\u2019t Dylan initiate a party conversation if a joint party is important to him? He clearly wasn\u2019t doing any planning himself. \n\nPaige should not have lied, but wanting to do her own thing sometimes should be welcomed and not seen as excluding him. They\u2019re twins, but they\u2019re still their own people with their own friends and interests.\n\nESH.", "ESH (except Dylan)\n\nPaige never should have lied and you for forcing them to share", "NTA - You are parenting.  She will naturally be upset.  The message you are sending is that it is not okay what she did.   It is not about treating them the same, it is about parenting in this situation.", "NTA since she lied to you, but you can certainly have handled it a different way. I really don\u2019t see how forcing them to have birthday party is gonna end up positive. It would be a lot more productive to make her apologize to him.\n\nYTA for requiring both of them to consent to have a different parties. This is pretty unfair because you\u2019re forcing the one who doesn\u2019t want to share a party to do so.

As twins most years they\u2019ve wanted to have a joint birthday celebration, but there have been a couple of years where they\u2019ve decided to have separate parties with different friend groups or at different locations. They tell me a few weeks before their birthday in May which thing they want to do that year. \n\nSo this year Paige told me that she and Dylan had decided they wanted to have their own parties, and she and her friends had already picked a whole theme and the activities that they wanted to do. I approved Paige\u2019s plan, and then a day or so later I asked Dylan what he wanted to do for his birthday party.\n\nAt this point I learned that Dylan and Paige had *not* mutually decided that they were having separate celebrations this year, and me asking Dylan about it was the first he was hearing that he was expected to have his own party. His feelings were very hurt that Paige had cut him out without so much as talking to him about it.\n\nSo I spoke with Paige and she admitted that she and her friends had decided on their own to exclude Dylan because they felt that a boy would wreck the activities they had planned. I told Paige that it wasn\u2019t okay for her to treat her brother that way and that the party I\u2019d originally agreed to was now cancelled, and that I expected her and Dylan to plan a joint birthday celebration with activities that all of their friends could enjoy.\n\nDylan is much happier with this arrangement, but Paige is angry and keeps saying that I ruined her party. I\u2019m worried that I might\u2019ve made a misstep because normally I try very hard to treat my kids as individuals and not just as a pair of twins, and I\u2019m worried that forcing Paige to share her birthday celebration with Dylan might send the wrong message on that front. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. I feel like you're missing an opportunity here to talk to Paige about why she found it necessary to lie, about why she didn't feel comfortable talking to her brother about her desire for separate plans, etc. 14 is an age when kids are supposed to be starting to pull away from their families to become their own people, but they don't have the emotional maturity to navigate that in a way that doesn't cause hurt to other people. Rather than punishing Paige by cancelling her party, why not sit down with her and find out what's going on, and talk about how to have difficult conversations and draw boundaries with other people in a way that is respectful to her own needs but not unnecessarily hurtful to others? That will be a much more useful skill that she can take with her into the rocky waters of young adulthood than resentment over an arbitrary punishment.", "YTA. Why do your sons feelings matter more than your daughters. Why can\u2019t she have her own things?", "YTA.  They are not a unit.  They are individuals.  Also sounds like you prefer your son and prioritize his wants.", "This is stupid, YTA. She\u2019s a teenage girl. It\u2019s okay she doesn\u2019t want to have a birthday party with her brother. You literally made a mountain out of a mole hill. Your prince is happy though, so all is right in the world.", "YTA. They're 14, not 4. They should be allowed to have their own individual parties. You're only going to make Paige resent her brother, and probably you as well.", "As a twin Softly YTA my parents made it a point to have us be in separate classes. Twins are two different people who need to feel free to express themselves more. I'm glad you know that. Parties only work if they both want to but your daughter doesn't and I would try to reframe it as wanting to express myself apart from my twin. It doesn't make our bond any less and this isn't a rejection. This is from the younger brother (Granted it's only a minute later lol) whose twin sister wanted her own things and she was denied a lot because of my comfort level and more withdrawn than her. This was hard for me to come to terms with initially around the teenage years but it honestly was for the best as it allowed me to find my depth and the new friends and able to find social fulfillment independent of my twin sister. I say this softly YTA just make sure you're not putting one twins comfort over the other this can breed resentment if this is a common dynamic.", "So Paige is not allowed to be her own person? She must always be tied to Dillons hip? I understand what she did was not nice. She should have talked to Dillon about it. \n\nBut are Dillon and his friends going to enjoy the same thing as 14 year old girls? Likely not. And at 14, the twins should naturally start enjoying their individuality. \n\nI have no problem with the cancelation of the party. Seems fitting. But stating she has to have her party with Dillon will embarrass her (overkill), and poor Dillon. He will have a sister with attitude at the party. \n\nI would have let Dillon have his own party. I probably reduced Paiges party to a sleep over without too much fanfare, or no party at all.\n\nBut i think you went hard on her for wanting to separate from her brother. The correct thing to go hard for her for is lying, and throwing her brother under the bus. I know you mentioned those things, but i get the impression you are more upset that she doesn't want to be a part of \"team twins\" antmore. They need space at this age. Not more togetherness.", "YTA. Paige lied and that needs to be addressed, but you do that by finding out why she lied. I have two kids, if they lie to me I find out why they felt they couldn\u2019t be honest. Sometimes it\u2019s the classic don\u2019t-want-to-get-in-trouble response, but other times it\u2019s because they worry I\u2019ll be disappointed or feel bad. The motivation is really important to know here: something made her feel like she couldn\u2019t even request her own party. \n\nTalk about the lie, decide an appropriate consequence but don\u2019t force her to share her party with someone. It\u2019s also going to make her brother look like a giant loser who\u2019s mommy is forcing kids to play with him. That\u2019s gonna hurt him socially at a crucial age.", "YTA\n\nAt 14, a shared party should require two yeses, not one yes and one no. Paige shouldn't be expected to ask her twin's permission. (Especially since they've done separate parties in the past.)\n\nYou've sent the message that when they disagree, Dylan's preference overrides Paige's, and used what should be an opportunity to celebrate them as a punishment.", "As a twin myself, YTA.\n\nIf one twin wants a separate party, they should be given the option. Yes Paige hurt Dylan by not speaking to him first, but at the same time it's pretty clear why she didn't - by going to you first, she wanted to be heard ***as an individual*** and you still shut her down.\n\n>I\u2019m worried that I might\u2019ve made a misstep because normally I try very hard to treat my kids as individuals and not just as a pair of twins, and I\u2019m worried that forcing Paige to share her birthday celebration with Dylan might send the wrong message on that front.\n\nYou are definitely sending the wrong message. Expect this to now be a point of contention for every 'joint' decision you make on their behalf, not just around birthdays.\n\n**ETA:** A bit of context, my (F) twin (M) and I had joint parties until we were in our 20s *because we wanted to*, and this party was the one that we invited all our relatives to. But from when we were about 13 we also did our own thing with our close friends in addition to this party, such as going out to dinner or go-karting or to the movies. Our parents treated us as individuals - like you want to do for your twins - and knowing that we had this support from them as equals meant that we ourselves ultimately came up with birthday plans that meant everyone got what they wanted. I know this wouldn't be the case for all twins, but because we knew we each had a say, we didn't try to overrule the other and we tried very hard to accommodate our twin's wishes knowing that our own would be accommodated too.", "Also why does Paige have to be the project planner for this? If Dylan wants a joint party he should be asking for one, not assuming the people around him are going to do his own planning/emotional labor.", "This question going unanswered says a lot.", "Info: OP could you answer the question?", "Good question", "Op you need to answer this question.  Your silence is doing to say it all", "I wondered this too.", "This is the million dollar question, u/Fresh-Tower-8803.", "Paige should NOT be expected to check in with her brother about HER birthday party. Did Dylan check in with Paige? Did Dylan plan anything?\n\nSounds like the OP is putting all the pressure on Paige, including expecting Paige to share her friends and include her brother. \n\nThat\u2019s completely unfair on every single level.", "Actually, Paige lied and tried to manipulate her parent.  She's not a victim here.", "Very good point.", "This does seem reasonable, I think I may have overreacted a bit because Dylan was so hurt.", "OP, do a combined family party but then they each get their own separate friend party/celebrations. It sounds like your daughter has a clear party in mind. If your son just wanted to do an activity with a best friend or have someone over for a sleepover he could keep it simple if he doesn't want his own party.", "So... are you saying that manipulating people and telling lies for her own selfish purpose should be rewarded?", ">Why is it so important to your son to have the party together? Does he have friends of his own?\n\nHonestly, I think he was just upset about being excluded. He does have his own friends and would probably have been happy to have his own party if he hadn't been blindsided with it.", "[deleted]", "Do you see how Paige might learn that lies and manipulation are the best way to get her own way?  If it ends up being no party for a dishonest liar, that might be an apt outcome.", ">And this is where girls learn that the world (even their mom) expects them to carry the emotional labor.\n\nTHIS!!\n\nOP, YTA. From what's been written, I'm extrapolating that if Dylan had wanted a joint party, but Paige wanted to have her own party, then they would have had to have a joint party. Paige didn't want that, but didn't think she could get it if she just said that she wanted her own party while her brother didn't. I do think there should be consequences for lying, but I don't think losing the party that she planned for her birthday is a proportional consequence.", "I have never read truer words. They each have the ability to want their own birthday party, just because they are twins doesn\u2019t mean they have to share and talk about every single birthday plans. They are growing up. OP says she treats them as individuals but I fail to see that here. \n\nYou can\u2019t tell me the son had no idea his birthday was coming and he needed to plan something if he wanted to celebrate. Teen girls are going to want to do teen girls stuff very likely they don\u2019t want boys involved. It is not up to the daughter to handle it for her brother. I have a feeling the daughter probably knew if she was straight forward, she would\u2019ve had to invite the brother because \u201cMom\u201d said so, and decided to omit the truth.", "[deleted]", "I think that's a bit out of line, no? It's not a gendered issue in that way, I'd have had the same reaction if Dylan and his friends were the ones excluding Paige.", "The girl lied and manipulated for her own selfish purpose.  This is where girls learn to be malignant narcissists.", "I'm with this comment 100%. Sure, Paige was wrong to pretend like she and Dylan had already discussed it. But the obliviousness on OP's part is astounding, especially since they claim to be aware of the whole \"twins get treated like one single person\" issue and try to avoid it.\n\nOP, your daughter is a teenager. She wants a birthday party catered to \\*her\\* interests, with only \\*her\\* friends, just like every single other person she knows gets. I'm shocked that this is a surprise to you. This is what most kids (heck, most ADULTS!) want. Instead, you're acting like if ONE of your twins wants to be joined at the hip, the other one HAS to comply or else it's an insult deserving of hurt feelings and punishment.\n\nIn fact, the status quo should actually be the opposite: if one twin wants more individuality, that request should automatically be honored. And the twin who might be feeling left behind or neglected should be lovingly parented to understand that even twins can have different interests and friend groups.\n\nI hope you can find your way to offering Paige an apology and helping her create a birthday party she really wants, instead of what you WANT her to want. You only have a couple more birthdays you get to celebrate during her childhood.", "A co-party should be a case of 2 yeses, 1 no.", "They're not being forced to share because Dylan wants to.  It's because Paige is trying to be a blossoming manipulative liar and her parent is trying to parent her.", "She has no obligation to tell her brother or ask his permission to have a separate party. And the way Mom was so worried about what Dylan wanted, I have a feeling that Paige had come to her mother and said she just wanted a separate party, mom would have asked Dylan first and if he said he wanted a joint party Mom would have made sure he had a joint party.", "I have a feeling we both know why Paige misled her mother. She knew that her mother would ask Dylan if he wanted a party with his sister and if he did he would have had it at Paige's expense. I wonder if Dylan even has friends and she's trying to force Paige and her friends to accept Dylan in their group.", "Paige needs to learn that telling lies and manipulating people is wrong.", "I get the feeling this isn\u2019t the first time Paige would be receiving that message", "The lying is probably because she knew if she had talked to Mom, Mom would have asked Dylan and Dylan would have said he wanted a joint party and he would have had a joint party.", "So... are you saying that manipulation and lying should just be ignored and OP's daughter should just get what she wants?", "How do you not see that telling lies to manipulate people is wrong?", "So you\u2019re ok with her daughter lying?", "[deleted]", ">For Paige's lying, maybe not giving her any friend celebration would be more appropriate than making her share it with Dylan.\n\nNow that you say this, that actually seems really obvious. I don't know why I didn't think of that.", "OP said Dylan isn\u2019t hurt by his sister\u2019s desire for an individual party. He\u2019s hurt that she tried to blindside him with it instead of telling him upfront.", "She's not wrong for wanting her own thing, but she is wrong for lying about it. Should lying not have consequences?", "I'd say that maybe the exact phrasing doesn't matter if Paige was being manipulative or deliberately choosing words carefully so that \"technically\" she didn't lie.\n\nMaybe mom jumped to conclusions, maybe Paige was misleading.\n\nAnd helping with setup and cleanup of Dylan's party is genius-level natural consequences.", "I don't think Paige has any responsibility to have this conversation with her brother. She is an individual even though she's a twin. And she doesn't have to ask his permission or blessing to be an individual and want her own party. Should she have lied to her mother? No but I have a feeling that if she had come to her mother and expressed she wanted a party by herself, her mother would have asked Dylan his thoughts and if he said no to individual parties, Paige would have been forced to have a party with him anyway.", "I hear this line of thinking, but my concern is this: what I'm seeing is a strong preference in this family for these twins to agree on things. OP requires them to even agree on whether or not they're going to do a joint party! What I didn't hear mentioned was \"if one opted out and didn't want to, we wouldn't do the joint party.\" It was stated that they both agree to do it or they both agree not to do it. Not a lot of room for dissenting feelings.\n\nObviously I'm filling in blanks here, but the few facts that OP lays out makes me wonder if there were past birthdays where Paige didn't really \\*want\\* to share a birthday but felt forced to comply because Dylan insisted and/or OP maybe gently encouraged it that way. It feels like there's a lot of focus by OP on Dylan's hurt feelings. My radar is pinging that perhaps Paige tried other ways to have an individual party in the past, and got shut down, BEFORE she resorted to lying.\n\nLying isn't okay. At all. She needs to learn that lesson. Both kids also need to learn that it's okay to want something different from your sibling. It's okay to have interests, friends, and a celebration that's just about you. And they all REALLY need to learn that sometimes people's feelings get hurt if you don't agree with them or do what they want, but that doesn't automatically make you a bad person deserving of punishment.", "DING DING DING \n\nIf you allow her to go forward with her separate plan, you're telling her that lying is OK.", ">Tell them to go into a room and talk and come out with a decision\n\nIs this meant as serious advice?", ">The issue here was simply they didn't discuss it together\n\nSo in your world lying to her parent and deliberately excluding her brother without letting him know are positive actions?", "but that doesn't fit the naritive.  we stopped having joint parties for our  kids when they were 10 or 11.. but letting her have her own now is rewarding negative behavior and has nothing to do with her sex..", "exactly", "As a triplet I\u2019m very accustomed to it being OUR birthday and rarely MY birthday. That\u2019s fine, my siblings are my best friends. But every now and then I do have to remind people that I exist as an individual as much as I love being a triplet. The mom definitely needs to work on letting them be separate people because I doubt this is an isolated issue. Multiples will love being a multiple so long as they get to be individuals first.", "For what it's worth, I agree with you on this, but there is one thing I don't think you're taking into account. History matters, OP states that this has traditionally been a combined party. I will absolutely agree that at 14, the default should be separate, but it hasn't been previously, so Paige's conversation with her brother about the party is relevant to the situation at hand. I 100% agree that she should not have to ask his permission to have her own party, but being that the default (whether it should be or not) is a combined party, a conversation needed to be had if she wanted to separate it.", "Paige shouldn't have lied though.  Dylan was deprived of the chance to plan his own party.  Forcing her to share is not the right move either, I'd have thought a word about honesty would be valuable.  I'm wondering if Dylan is a bit clingy to Paige, or if the default is to have a joint party if one of them wants that.  \n\nSoft YTA OP,  you possibly should have checked in with Dylan on his party plan when Paige stated they had talked, but also forcing them to share gives a sense that spending time with Dylan is a punishment which won't help their relationship. \n\nI'd discuss the lying with Paige, why did she feel it was necessary? Offer communication options for the future. She coul still go to his party so he wouldn't be alone, so I'd also check in on Dylan more generally about his sense of independence. It should be OK for her to have her own birthday the way she wants it and shouldn't need to lie.\n\nEdit: I reread the post and I'm embarrassed. I had just woken up and had (still have) a headache. Somehow I understood it as there being weeks between OP speaking to Paige and Dylan but it was a day or two. My apologies.", "Nope the fact she felt she had no other choice but to lie to try and get a different celebration is sad. \n\nMom is going to make her resent her brother.

I (we) just had my (our) birthday yesterday and i remember when we were little and i was the one that wanted my own party and not to share with her.

Then she is going to resent him for being the reason her birthday is being ruined.", "So no celebration for her? Ouch.", "You're parenting wrong. That's too extreme for a little lie.

You need to do some serious self evaluation.", "This will be just digging yourself in deeper.", "Do not use a birthday party as punishment for what was a relatively small offense. While lying is not good, you need to address why she felt compelled to lie. I would hazzard a guess that she told you that she didn't want a joint party but didn't know what he wanted. The result would be that he would get the deciding vote. Exactly like he did.", "At this point I think you\u2019re grasping at straws to not have to back track and lose face for what you\u2019ve forced on her. \n\nYes she lied but to cancel her entire birthday party over something she shouldn\u2019t have even been placed in the position to lie over is pretty ridiculous. It should never have been assumed they\u2019d be having celebrations together. The default should have been separate. And perhaps as the *parent* you should have had discussions with them about what they wanted well in advance instead of making them figure it out alone. Did you discuss why she felt she needed to lie about it? I feel like there is probably more to the story, but, regardless, canceling her part of the birthday celebration is extreme and sure to breed resentment between the siblings and with you and her.", "Wow... You just jump to one overeaction right to another... \n\nI can see why Paige felt the need to lie.", "It's absolutely insane that you're punishing a 14-year-old for trying to foster some independence.

He is hurt either way and this a chance to have his feelings heard and validated the same goes for his sister", "Yes she's wrong for lying, and there should be consequences. She should have been upfront with her brother about her plans.Forcing her to have a party she doesn't want will mean that nobody enjoys it and it then the resentment starts.- it then means effectively everyone is punished.", "Her brother was under the impression that they were having a joint birthday party.

They're 14 the problem here isn't having a joint party or separate parties. It's because Paige didn't bother to tell her brother how she felt. I get the feeling if they just talk it out he'll understand and have his own party.  \n\nIf OP just agree with Paige and say separate parties Dylan feels bad. You do the opposite Paige feels bad. \n\nHave them talk to each other and it be their decision. Most likely they'll come up with one that will make both of them happy", "As a twin couldn't agree more", "I mean, Paige would've been right to say, \"Hey, I don't want a joint party this year,\" to her mother, without mentioning Dylan (or with specification that she hasn't talked to Dylan). The problem is that she acted as if she had already talked to Dylan, and then OP accidentally blindsided him. I can imagine maybe she didn't know how else to approach the subject, but it's the lie that was unfair.", "Nope. She says that t least a couple of times they\u2019ve had separate parties, so not out of the blue.

Letting manipulation slide doesn't work towards that goal.\n\nFrom OP's post it sounds like all Paige had to do was get together with OP and Dylan and say she wanted her own girl's party with girl stuff and both OP and Dylan would have been ok with it and there was no need to lie about it at all.", "So you\u2019re justifying her lying. Got it. If I was the parent I\u2019d have just told her no party at all for lying.

Its not a reward, its her birthday and (in my opinion) that should be a right at her age. OP has every right to punish her daughter, but do it by grounding her or forgoing an allowance.

For not being happy about it?  For not bothering to show up or invite any of her friends?", "Yeah, but it shouldn't be taking away her party and forcing her to have one with the brother, that is extreme.  They're teenagers.  It was cute when they were 5.  It's ridiculous now.", "Hmmmm...

Nobody is demanding that she gets her brother's permission to do anything.

No. But talk to the kids.  Communicate.  Help teach her how to behave and discuss this in the future.  It's her birthday party.

As a twin, autonomy is a super hard thing to fight for, especially in the teens when everyone\u2019s trying to figure out who they are anyway. By the time we were 14, we had separate interests, friends, preferences\u2026 as we should have. Usually, wed plan for the parties themselves on different days, and would simply allow the other to come to our party if they wanted. Also, if Paige is worried Dylan would wreck her plans, maybe talk to her about that? It sounds like a valid fear, not an unfounded claim. Would Dylan try to wreck her party? And if so, would there be as harsh punishment as you\u2019re giving paige right now?", "op=YTA\n\nYes it wasn't right of her to NOT ask Paige, but to force her to have a party she did not agree to or want.  That isn't going to magically make her want to have a party with her brother.\n\nYou could have canceled the original plans that she lied about(FOR LYING), but still had separate parties.  I'm sorry that Dylan was hurt, but she's not going to make \"His\" birthday better when she's bitter and angry.", "ESH\n\nPaige lied and should not be rewarded for lying by having a separate party. Dylan seems to have counted on just having a combined party and didn't do anything for himself. I think neither of them should have a separate party and there definitely shouldn't be a combined party. 14 years old is not a milestone - they should have only a family \"celebration\" (more like acknowledgement) of their joint birthday. They should both be told that going forward they have to state their preference at a reasonable time ahead of the birthday to say what they want, or else there won't be a \"party\" - just a brief family get-together.", "YTA they are 14 not 4.  They should be celebrating and celebrated separately so now Your son gets what he wants and your daughter?", "ESH\n\nYou can compromise. Do a big joint party for family and a separate smaller one just for her friends.", "ESH.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Dylan. Why would Dylan have any grounds to be upset here? You say that the twins have had the option to pick between a joint and split party. Dylan is 14. He\u2019s old enough to plan a party or to inquire after a party. You, as the parent, also had the means to reach out to him as soon as you talked to Paige. On what grounds can Dylan claim to be blindsided? Paige lied to you, not Dylan. Dylan didn\u2019t know anything. It\u2019s actually critically important for a young man to learn the importance of assuming emotional labor. Your punishment of Paige undermined any lesson to Dylan about the importance of learning to undertake emotional labor. Dylan acted as if a party was just going to fall into his lap. He literally can\u2019t claim to be blindsided without an expectation, which is this case would have been a party, which shouldn\u2019t have been possible if you truly allow the kids to chose between a joint party or separate gatherings. He should have known that Paige could choose a separate gathering and should have been reaching out to Paige and you about the birthday plans for this year. \n\n\u2026 Unless, of course, the twins really can\u2019t choose on an individual basis. If, of course, you have made it so both twins need to agree to separate parties because otherwise they have a joint one, then, yeah, Dylan had an expectation. And that would be why Paige lied.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s a massive problem. The twins have outgrown that stage of birthday celebrations. That was a reasonable approach when they were in elementary school. Giving them the option to choose, for example, between a joint bowling party or two separate smaller parties at home is totally reasonable in grade school. It makes sense as a default when you are juggling younger kids who need greater involvement from their parents in terms of planning and hosting a party. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make any sense for anyone who is a preteen or older, children who are old enough to start planning their own parties and who are dealing with the trials of adolescence.\n\nPaige lied to you. That\u2019s bad. Your first question should have been WHY Paige lied to you \u2026 unless, again, you already know that Paige lied to you because you never would have allowed her to have had a separate party without Dylan\u2019s signing off, which is inappropriate at this stage in life. \n\nConversely, if Paige sincerely had no reason to lie, then you need to get to the bottom of why she lied \u2026 and your much bigger issue is Dylan, who would have had zero grounds to have justifiably expected a joint party and who needs the much bigger lesson about emotional labor and responsibility. \n\nEither way, Paige\u2019s punishment for lying is disproportionate to her actual lie.", "YTA.", ">I try very hard to treat my kids as individuals and not just as a pair of twins\n\nCould've fooled me.

I'm a twin. I shared every single birthday party I ever had with my sister. For the most part, it was okay. We usually had the same friend group. Sharing things like that comes with the territory of being a twin. But when I started making my own friends that weren't also friends with my sister, I wasn't allowed to invite them to our birthday parties (and if I did, my sister got angry, and my friends were often excluded in conversations or treated as outsiders). But my sister was allowed to invite her friends, even when I started to become distant from her friend group. As I got older, the shared birthday parties started to become less fun for me, and more about what my sister wanted to do because she had more friends, and so she got to plan everything. \n\nShould Paige have lied? No. But I'm thinking Paige lied because she knew if Dylan voiced what he wanted, she would be forced to share a party again, with no consideration for what she wanted. \n\nThe moment one of the twins doesn't want to share a birthday party, they don't share a party. If you force them to share, I can guarantee one of them will be miserable. If Dylan wants to share a party, Paige can attend whatever gathering/party he has, but she should be allowed to have her own separate gathering if she wants. You don't even need to spend much money on it, just let her have a separate get-together without her brother. \n\nBeing a twin can be a great thing, but there are many downsides. Sharing a birthday can be a sore point among many twins. You said you want to treat Paige and Dylan as individuals, so do so.", "INFO: if neither had lied to you, and one had to you he/she wanted a solo party and the other one a joined one, what would have happened?", "NTA\n\nPaige lied.

Often times twins find themselves in competition with each other, especially in a social sphere - so when you have twins that clearly seem to have different social circles, why continue a joint birthday? Birthdays are something special - Id rather spend mine with just my close friends, not with my close friends and my brother and his close friends.\n\nI mean dude, your kids are growing up.

I\u2019m also the parent that separated my kids in Kindergarten and they even went to different schools for a few months before the pandemic, so I am firm believer in allowing them to have their own identities. My kids actually get along fairly well at home, but don\u2019t share a lot of the same interests either.

Which makes me think more is going on.\n\nI don\u2019t believe you should throw your hands and say all well they lied. I believe in finding out why you lied.

Yes, Paige should've made Dylan aware she'd rather have her own party with her friends, which would allow Dylan to do likewise. I know puberty hits differently between boys and girls, so I also kind of feel for Dylan since he may not have the pituitary gland going yet and thus may not understand Paige's feelings.

No, OP clearly favours the brother and would have said no so long as the brother wanted a joint party", "I feel like most folks here just project their own insecurities and add flavor to the whole story so often. You guys have absolutely no idea if OP always favors Dylan. This is just a pure assumption. \n\nAlso, they have previously done separate parties.

It just won't be a front and centre part of their identity.\n\nOne last thing. Why can't your son plan his own party? Why does he have to have a joint one with his sister?", "Um so easy\u2026 YTA. You gave one child what they wanted and refused to give the other child what they wanted. Even though you had already okaye\u2019d her original plan.\nYou are CLEARLY picking one\u2019s feelings over the other??? YTA.", "YTA, the twins are teenagers and different persons with different interests. And you force them to be the same. Paige will now be angry, not only with you, but with her brother too.", "YTA\n\nTelling Paige you\u2019re disappointed she didn\u2019t communicate with her brother is one thing. Forcing her to \u2018celebrate\u2019 her birthday in a way she doesn\u2019t want to with people she doesn\u2019t want to while sharing the birthday spotlight isn\u2019t.\n\nAlso, did Dylan ask Paige what she wanted to do? Why is the burden on Paige to approach Dylan? Why is he getting exactly what he wants while she isn\u2019t?\n\n\u201cNormally I try very hard to treat my kids as individuals and not just a pair of twins.\u201d This is the opposite of that.", "Money wise, it makes sense for the default to be a shared birthday. If they both want a separate birthday, that can be a lot of funds going towards two events for one day (or in a close time frame)", "Preach!!!! This is so true! Hadn\u2019t thought of this!", "It's a pitty I can only upvote this once, and unfortunately I don't have an award to give to you.", "Nailed it with a capital NAILED IT.", "I'm also a twin and I agree the joint birthday shouldn't be the default, but the sister lying about agreeing with the brother is a big no from me and that should warrant some kind of punishment.\n\nBecause precedent dictates that sometimes they share and sometimes they don't, it's common courtesy to at least inform the other twin that this is happening - not get permission, but like \"heads up I'm doing this with my friends this year so you do your own thing\".", "My brother and I are only 6 weeks apart, and when we were little our parents absolutely did shared parties to save money. We both hated it. No matter what was chosen for venue, activities, and food, one of us would always feel steamrollered for the other. In my memories it was always his friends, his pick of venue, his choice of food, I was lucky if Mum thought to bring one thing I wasn't allergic to for me to eat, and the closest we ever came to anything for me was a Pooh Bear cake... except it was Piglet, who was his favorite character not mine, and by the time he and his friends each had one slice, there wasn't enough left for both me and my one guest to have some. Yet when he finally blew up about shared parties and not wanting them anymore, he cited that they were always all about me and the only thing for him was who was invited. \n\nWhat we ended up settling on after we'd both had enough of that, was a quiet family celebration for each of us on our actual birthdays, and a big non birthday, no particular reason party in the summer for our friends and Mum and Dad's friends who have kids. It turned out much better that way, and Mum and Dad must have learned something from the blowup because the summer party has never felt excessively catered to either one of us at the other's expense. We haven't had it since before Covid but it was fun.", "You can put ESH if that's the judgment", "... about society.\n\nEDIT: it was a joke, chill.", "He hasn't done shit to prepare for his birthday, clearly he was banking on his sister once again doing all the planning. If anything the child that doesn't plan should just learn that it'll be a birthday with just their parents", ">Honestly, I think he was just upset about being excluded.\n\nYou should have helped him with coping and planning his own party - not ruining Paige's instead.\n\nAnd how can he be blindsided?  He knows when his birthday is.  At any point, he could have spoken up for himself instead of waiting for you to hold his hand.", "She should be expected to not lie about it.", "Why should she have to get his permission or consult with him about her birthday?", "It\u2019s a week to the party, Paige has planned hers and sorted things out, ckearky Dylan has done no such thing and was just planning on riding on whatever his sister planned", "I agree the parties should be separate, but they have had separate parties in the past, so why are we assuming that a joint one would be forced?", ">She has no obligation to tell her brother or ask his permission to have a separate party.\n\nCorrect.  But she does have an obligation not to lie.", "People read so much into the OP not answering questions in the first however many hours, and 95% or more of the time it's just \"I made my post, responded to questions for 30 minutes, then went to do something else and I'll check back tomorrow to see how people have judged me\".", "It's not so long ago that parents organising things was the default. Maybe he was expecting that, since no-one had started an open discussion about other preferences.", "Even if they are friends they might be very different people and want very different birthdays.

I\u2019m the older but quiet one and I decided to go to a different high school. \n\nWe are in our 40s and unashamedly each others best friend.\n\nThat individualism works a great deal. I was a twin in the 80s-90s when it was less common and kids would freak out. There was one other set of twins in our grade and no one even knew they were siblings.

I just believe sometimes you have to look at why they felt this was necessary. Why daughter felt it was necessary to lye over a party. \n\nIf it\u2019s because mom always favors the brother.

I didn\u2019t. We still did it. \n\n - As a teen, birthdays in venues I really disliked\n\n- on my 18th birthday I made my own plans. My mother made me change them on the day, and spend the day organising a surprise for my sister and including her in my plans (she had her own group of friends I wasn\u2019t a fan of)\n\n- both mother and sister insisted to throw a party at home for like 5 years in a row when my preference was to book a table at a bar and just tell whoever to come hang out (including my sister and her friends). Instead I had to create a limited guest list, order food, buy drinks, and then listen to my mother complain about the \u2018kind\u2019 of people I was friends with, about how much alcohol people drink (normal amounts, but she thinks people should stop at one drink) everyone left super early because my family is stuffy, and I didn\u2019t enjoy any of it.", "Because she is 14 and doesn't think things through. She was happy with her plans and went straight to mum to get approval before the deadline, that was her priority, not making sure she didn't hurt her brothers feelings by wanting to do something on her own.", "I think it's more of the sister being the more popular of the two and having more friends.  Of course he's happy now, he gets all his sister's friends at his birthday party while him and his one or two friends act like they are part of that social circle", "This! Everyone seems to forget they are 14.", "The whole issue is OP trying to square a circle.\n\nEither the twins have the age appropriate choice to pick a joint or separate party, in which case Paige meaninglessly lied to OP, which is an issue, and Dylan\u2019s sense of being blindsided makes no sense and is the far larger issue (Dylan is too old to just assume that his twin\u2019s friends will be his, he has had years of knowing that they can have separate parties if one of them makes the choice to do so, and the larger issue is why Dylan made no effort to inquire after his own birthday.). Paige would absolutely deserve punishment for lying to OP, but in this scenario, the punishment for Paige would undermine the more crucial life lesson for Dylan about reasonable expectations and emotional labor.\n\nOR\n\nDylan had a reasonable expectation of a combined party because OP forces any decision for separate parties to be a two yes, one no scenario, which isn\u2019t age appropriate for the twins and would explain why Paige lied. The scenario would explain OP\u2019s focus on Dylan being blindsided (even though I agree with you that the issue should be about the lying, OP\u2019s commentary makes it clear that a big issue for OP is the sense of Dylan\u2019s being left out).\n\nPaige\u2019s lying isn\u2019t good, but the larger issue is the unreasonable expectations of either Dylan or OP. Punishing Paige to the degree OP is doesn\u2019t solve the larger issue in either scenario.", "Omg will the family ever recover from this horrific lie their 14 year old daughter told \ud83e\udd75seriously if she felt the need to lie about consulting her brother, think critically about what kind of family this is.

However, the precedent is that a conversation must be had either way.\n\nThat conversation can be \"I'm having a separate party this year\", but it needs to have been a conversation. \n\nThe base expectation is that it'd be a joint party. While eithet kid can simply decide they don't want that, it's still a little assholish to lead her brother on by omission and lie to their parents about having had the conversation.\n\nSetting expectations is important.\n\nESH, but mostly still leaning towards dad. This punishment is way too far.", "Why is everyone latching onto the 2 separate parties OP mentions and holding onto them like they are law? The 11 joint parties is the precedent.", "The precedent was that they both agreed and discussed to have a separate parties, according to OP. Which didn't happen.", "I'm with you, HalfVast. OP may or may not be the AH, but that Paige girl most definitely is, like most 14 year old girls. She lies, and doesn't give a flying f**k about her brother's feelings. But she lies. She's a selfish liar. This question has been asked SOLELY because of her selfish lies. Being a 14 year old girl doesn't justify any of that.", "Yep it does. And if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck well then it\u2019s a duck.", "No? She gets forced to a joint party because she lied to her parent about talking with her brother. So yeah... that's literally what the word manipulative means...", "See, I think you're reading a lot into this, too. \n\nShe's 14. She's going to try to take the path of least resistance - lie to her mother, because it's easier than talking to her brother. Making sure there are consequences for her behavior is how she can learn to make better choices.", "She GAVE the answer as to why she lied; she's 14 and her friends told her it'd be a great idea to do so. Group identity is super important at that age, and to her friends cruelty towards the brother *is* the point - it's not enough that the parties be separate, the blindside had to happen so that the brother knew he was being purposefully excluded.", "See that\u2019s my problem one kid should not get to decide to have a combined party forcing the one who wants a separate party into it. In this case it\u2019s sister bday too even if she has to share the day she should not be forced to share a party because her brother wants to.\n\nEither they not want a combine party or it doesn\u2019t have too. Op\u2019s way forcing them to have a combine party builds resentment. If piss me off to be forced into a combine party because my brother doesn\u2019t want a separate party and now I have to do what he wants.

My point is that at 14 is ok to promote individualism instead of keeping them as a unit. \n\nA lot of parents get wrapped up in the\u201dtwins\u201d they forget each is a individual.\n\nBrother should have at this point expect individual celebrations instead of being surprise it wasn\u2019t."]}
