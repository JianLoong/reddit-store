{"id": 15287, "submission_id": "12tfszz", "title": "AITA for forcing my daughter to share a birthday celebration with her twin brother?", "selftext": "I have two kids, Paige (14/F) and Dylan (14/M). As twins most years they\u2019ve wanted to have a joint birthday celebration, but there have been a couple of years where they\u2019ve decided to have separate parties with different friend groups or at different locations. They tell me a few weeks before their birthday in May which thing they want to do that year. \n\nSo this year Paige told me that she and Dylan had decided they wanted to have their own parties, and she and her friends had already picked a whole theme and the activities that they wanted to do. I approved Paige\u2019s plan, and then a day or so later I asked Dylan what he wanted to do for his birthday party.\n\nAt this point I learned that Dylan and Paige had *not* mutually decided that they were having separate celebrations this year, and me asking Dylan about it was the first he was hearing that he was expected to have his own party. His feelings were very hurt that Paige had cut him out without so much as talking to him about it.\n\nSo I spoke with Paige and she admitted that she and her friends had decided on their own to exclude Dylan because they felt that a boy would wreck the activities they had planned. I told Paige that it wasn\u2019t okay for her to treat her brother that way and that the party I\u2019d originally agreed to was now cancelled, and that I expected her and Dylan to plan a joint birthday celebration with activities that all of their friends could enjoy.\n\nDylan is much happier with this arrangement, but Paige is angry and keeps saying that I ruined her party. I\u2019m worried that I might\u2019ve made a misstep because normally I try very hard to treat my kids as individuals and not just as a pair of twins, and I\u2019m worried that forcing Paige to share her birthday celebration with Dylan might send the wrong message on that front.

I\u2019ve never been a teen boy but I have been a teen girl and I remember how insanely close I was with my friends and all the crazy fun girl things we did together that we would have been horrified to share with boys. Let her have the party she wants. They are two separate people. \n\nI\u2019m also wondering - Why is it so important to your son to have the party together? Does he have friends of his own?", "YTA.  They're teens now.  It's completely reasonable that she wants her own party.  And frankly it should be default at this point that they have separate parties.  She should be able to have her own party without her brother's permission.", "Yta and how exactly do you see this working out?  She isn't going to plan, she isn't going to participate; you'll be lucky if she shows up.  It's really going to end up a party for your son and no party for your daughter. \n\n\nThey are two separate people.  The *default* should be seperate.", "YTA. The girl planned a party for herself and her friends. The boy failed to do so. Now the girl is forced to put together another party to accommodate the boy. And this is where girls learn that the world (even their mom) expects them to carry the emotional labor.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re very clearly favoring Dylan by only allowing the plan he is happy about. Have fun intentionally ruining Paige\u2019s birthday and inevitably making Dylan\u2019s worse too because she\u2019ll resent him. This kind of parenting mistake poisons sibling relationships. Let them have separate parties and help your son plan something he will enjoy.", "YTA for forcing a joint party. That could lead to your daughter turning her anger at you towards her brother. \n\nHave repercussions for lying and not talking to her brother ahead of time. Don\u2019t turn having a joint birthday party into a punishment.", "YTA for forcing them to share birthdays. They don\u2019t need to mutually decide to have them separately. This is an individual decision and it\u2019s ridiculous to force them to share just be sure Dylan wants to.", "YTA she should have a minor punishment (not forcing the parties together) for lying and not discussing it with her brother. \n\nHowever, OP is partially at fault if they make her feel obligated to share. I don\u2019t understand why she wouldn\u2019t have just told her brother she wants them separate again. Is she afraid of something? Or was she trying to blindside him for kicks?", "YTA.  There comes a time when boys' and girls' interests heavily diverge, and then a few years later, they'll converge again.  Your daughter is at a stage in life where she and her friends want to do girl stuff on her birthday, and having a bunch of boys at the celebration would kill the vibe.  I don't know why Dylan has a say in how Paige decides to celebrate her birthday.  Of course Dylan is happier with this arrangement because he got his way, and you've forced your daughter to invite him and his friends to her party.  Imagine how you would have felt at fourteen if you'd been forced to celebrate your birthday party with your sibling's friends.", "No birthday party at all would be way over the top. Your enthusiasm here is really telling. How often do you find yourself blatantly favoring Dylan or just choosing harsher punishments for Paige? Don\u2019t fuck around with kids\u2019 birthdays. You can\u2019t undo it and it\u2019s a bad look for you that sticks around. Based on your post and your comments I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019ve been slowly chipping away at their sibling relationship for a long time.", "YTA - You've got two issues here. To have a joint party or not, and the fact Paige lied. \nThe joint party should only happen if BOTH kids enthusiastically want it. That doesn't mean they can't invite the other twins friends to their own party. But it's a two YES, one NO situation. Also, they don't have to have a PARTY. They can have a day out, a day of doing what they want at home, a day of hobbies, etc. If Dylan isn't the most social person, he doesn't have to go through with a PARTY if he doesn't want to. \nPaige should face some sort of consequence for lying, but first I would be more interested in finding out WHY she lied. Why can't she discuss this with her brother? Why is Dylan so much happier with a joint party? Until you've gotten to the bottom of that, hold off on the consequences for the lies.", ">They tell me a few weeks before their birthday in May which thing they want to do that year. \n\nINFO: what occurs when one doesn't want a joint party or there's disagreements about guests/activities etc? Also who usually does most of the planning of the joint parties? Is it equal or does Paige handle a lot of the details?", "YTA - They should only have a joint party if they both want a joint party not the other way around.", "INFO: Have you asked Paige *why* she lied to you about coming to an agreement with Dylan about their birthday? If she had come to you and just said \"hey mom, I don't want to have a joint party this year\" but Dylan had wanted one... how would you have handled it? Does the mutual agreement actually matter here? \n\nThe lying obviously isn't great but I really need to understand the why of it a bit better before passing judgement.", "YTA. You have it completely backwards. The default should be that Paige gets her own birthday party unless they decide together to have a joint party. \nYou owe Paige an apology for making her feel like she did something wrong by wanting to celebrate her birthday with her friends. Paige deserves autonomy.", "Paige should have been able to say that she wants her own party and that should have then been the end of it- individual parties, no problem done and dusted. The fact that she lied tells me that Paige probably feels Dylan would have gotten his way, her feelings would have been ignored and you would have forced her to share a party. So YTA for that reason and it\u2019s something you need to work on. Unless you think she lied just to be malicious?", "It sounds to me that Paige's only mistake was that she didn't tell her brother before she started making plans. She's 14, so I give her a pass for being avoidant, though obviously you should tell her she should not repeat that, and actually communicate. Like, what if she told Dylan from the start she wanted separate parties and he said he wanted a mutual one. It would not be reasonable to force a mutual party on her under those circumstances, so it does not make sense to me to force her to now, just because Dylan was blind-sided. So, yes, I'm afraid YTA.", "YTA, they are two individual people. If one person is opposed to sharing a birthday, then they should get their own. She does not need her brothers permission to have her own celebration because it doesn't impact him as long as he gets his own as well. YTA, she's going to resent you if you keep celebrating them as a set and not as their own person.", "YTA she's a teenager, it's expected for her to want independence. Dylan is valid in being sad but forcing her to share the party is an AH move.", "YTA \n\nNot leaving much space for individualism if you force them to have joint parties. They are now teenagers and Paige clearly wants to do her own thing.", "YTA.  I understand wanting to teach her to be considerate of your son, but at this age the default shouldn't be a joint party unless they both agree to individuals, it should be separate parties unless they both agree to a joint party.  At 14 they are trying to figure out who they are and exert independence, and it's even harder for a twin to do that.  By all means, have a discussion with her about being considerate of her brother's feelings and how she could have handled the situation better, but taking her party away as a punishment is cruel and an overreaction.", "YTA - it's hard enough for twins to be seen as an individual without you adding fuel to the fire.", "YTA Your kids are individuals and should not be forced to share birthday parties.  My brother and I were born a day apart yet we (were forced to) share birthday celebrations. \n\nThey are not some generic unit and whether she consulted with him first or not, she made her wishes known and you should respect that.", "YTA - You are not treating them as individuals and you are sending the message to Dylan that his wants and feelings are more important than his sister's.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nI understand being upset that Paige excluded Dylan and she definitely should be forced to apologize. \nBut making the party joint is only going to  cause Dylan to not enjoy it because Paige is definitely gonna make it known she's miserable as well as cause animosity amongst them.", "YTA. They are 14. Let them pick separate parties. \n\nPaige shouldn\u2019t have lied and needs to apologize for it. But the punishment shouldn\u2019t be adjoined party.", "YTA, if Dylan wanted a party he should have taken the time to plan one like Paige did. All you did was reaffirm the age old tradition of mothers putting their sons above their daughters. Why should Paige give up her plans because of Dylan? Why can\u2019t he have his own plans?", "They shouldn't have to mutually decide this. It would make more sense for them to have to mutually agree to a joint party. If your daughter wants her own day, she should have it because she's her own person. This is a good opportunity to have your son learn how to regulate disappointment instead of coddling him and divorcing your daughter to accommodate him. I will never understand why parents so heavily favor their songs that daughters have to accommodate constantly. YTA.", "Paige and Dylan are different people. Paige shouldn\u2019t need Dylan\u2019s approval to celebrate her birthday with her friends.", "YTA.  Why does daughter need brother's permission to have separate parties?  Have consequences for lying sure, but this is extreme.  You'll be back on here after this joint party complaining that it was ruined by your daughter sulking and not participating in a party that is supposed to celebrate her, that she didn't want, and is being used as a punishment.  There is no way for this to end well, and it will also hurt your son, who is the only innocent person in this post.", "YTA.\n\nPaige was wrong for lying about her and Dylan agreeing to this. This definitely deserved a conversation and some form of punishment.  However, taking away her party is a case where the punishment does **not** fit the crime.\n\nEdit: Typo and clarity", "As a twin myself,  YTA and i don't understand why you're asking. You said you try to not treat them as a package deal but your daughter didn't want to do things with her friends and her brother.... now you're making her? How do you not see that you're in the wrong.", "Both you and Paige are TA's. \n\nPaige shouldn't have lied. Period. \n\nHowever at 14 it is totally reasonable for her to want her own party. Twins really do often get shortchanged when it comes to having their individuality recognized. She is feeling that. Maybe give her consequences for lying, but allow her her own party. On a purely practical level having a sulking 14yr old girl forced to celebrate her birthday with her brother is not going to make for a very happy party for her brother or anyone else in attendance.", "YTA.\n\nAt 14yo it is normal to want to be your own person.  As they are different genders, it is even more likely that they would want different parties.  Surely, it wasn't a surprise to Dylan that he would be asked this question.\n\nYour decision to cancel Paige's party to accommodate Dylan is not a good look.  Dylan got what he wanted and Paige is being punished.  Guessing Paige now has little interest in a party or celebration of her birthday.  For Paige's lying, maybe not giving her any friend celebration would be more appropriate than making her share it with Dylan.", "YTA.  You are doing the opposite of treating your twins as individuals.  You are also placing a higher value on dylan's feelings than paige's. Probably not the first time.\n\n Why is dylan's want to have a joint party more important than paige's want NOT to have a joint party.", "Info: if Dylan wants a joint party and Paige does not, what do you do?", "YTA. At a certain point even twins need to start separating and I'd say 14 is about the right age. Forcing a mixed party on someone that clearly doesn't want it will create some bad feelings.", "Why is Dylan\u2019s happiness more important to you than Paige\u2019s independence \n\nPaige got into planning her birthday and did so.\nDid Dylan do anything for his?\n\nWhy should she have to check what she wants to do for HER birthday with her sibling/twin\n\nYes she shouldn\u2019t of lied,  but surely there is a better punishment then  in forcing a double party that\u2019s the AH move", "YTA. Yes Paige should of told her brother first but they are teenagers now and need their own individuality. Forcing them to have w joint party is the complete opposite of that. have a talk with both your child; tell your daughter it was wrong to not discuss her feelings with her brother first before going to you about the party. Tell your son you understand why he was upset but this is learning/growing point in his life where he can learn not everything needs or has to be shared with his twin and that this can be his chance to have a party with all of his friends and likes and interests. I wish you all the best", "YTA", "YTA. But Im gona try to help\n\nThis could be a great teaching moment about empathy and acceptance. \n\nFor Paige, its understandable to want space; but in the future, thats her brother and its good to communicate. Ghosting someone is wrong, and lying about it also wrong. But, its ok to want her own party, she just needs to apologize to Dylan that she chose that route. Seems they have had an unspoken routine most times up until now. She doesnt 'owe' her brother her plans like that, but have empathy that, yeah she can understand how Dylan is hurt. \n\nDylan, while understandably hurt by the blindside. Also needs to learn that, his feelings are valid firstly. Second, its also ok she wants to do her own thing and doesnt meant anything different about his relationship with his sister. (Not inferring he was thinking that, more so just incase he is) this year, it'll be separate party's, no worries but at least hes aware and has time to plan his own thing. \n\nPersonally, as a parent myself this is how I would've tried to go about it. Still time to untangle the chaos Op, good luck.\n\nEdited* typos", "Soft YTA. I can\u2019t fathom twins, especially opposite gender twins, but they are 14 and at the point they need to forge identities outside of being twins. It seems Paige is trying to do this while Dylan is not. I\u2019m guessing Paige is outgoing and Dylan is more introverted?", "YTA your prioritizing your sons feelings over your daughters. If you give them the option to have separate parties they shouldnt have to agree on it. You could have talked to her and explained why what she did hurt his feelings and then have her apologize but keep the parties separate. You over corrected and it might cause resentment down the line. I\u2019m (f) a twin with my brother and it was really easy to see the favouritism based on gender.", "Info: previously when they had separate parties whose idea was it? Who brought it up, you? Them?", "YTA for giving them joint celebrations to begin with. They\u2019re separate people, and if they decided to do a joint party, they could decide that on their own. But YOU are setting them up for a bad relationship", "Yep YTA", "YTA. Seems to me like Dylan is learning that he can rely on his sister to do all the work. If you were trying to encourage them to be individuals, how about encourage Dylan to do this for himself instead of glomming onto his sisters plans.", "YTA. It is COMPLETELY reasonable for your teenage daughter to want birthday plans with other girls and not her brother. Sure, she lied, but probably because you wouldn\u2019t have listened if she told you she didn\u2019t care what her brother thinks, she wants something to herself. Why are your son\u2019s feelings more important than your daughter\u2019s? You\u2019ve set up a really sticky dynamic here, tbh.", "YTA your kids may be twins but it\u2019s ok for them to have different friend and activities. Your daughter felt that instead of being honest with you it was best to lie because at least she had a chance to get her on special celebration.\n\nYou are not teaching her a lesson on family first. You are teaching her to resent her brother that she has to share everything with.", "YTA. They're teenagers now, so bound to have their own friends and interests.\n\nPaige is within he right to want a separate party without her brother and she doesn't need to agree with him that's what she wants to do. She could have been more tactful and let him know, but she's not wrong for wanting it.\n\nMaking her share with him when that's not what she wants is only going to make her resent him. It's hard enough for twin to forge their own identities without having to do everything together.", "ESH - Your daughter shouldn't have claimed that she had decided with her brother, if that's what she actually said.  Did she say \"Dylan and I decided...\" or did she just say \"Dylan and I are having separate parties and I know what I want for mine!\"  The second isn't technically a lie, so the exact way she phrased it matter.\n\nThe default for anyone over 3yrs old that shares a birthday with a family member (whether or not they are twins) should be to have separate celebrations.  Your birthday should be your special day.  Have one do the weekend before and the other the weekend after.  That way if they have mutual friends, those friends can attend both parties without needing to choose between the kids.\n\nYou shouldn't have responded by forcing a joint party.  I know some people say that's the penalty for lying, but it's an over reaction if she did lie outright and say she had talked to Dylan and he agreed, and it's completely out of line if she never directly said she had talked with her brother and you had just assumed she had.  Either way, from your daughter's point of view you have told her that her brother's feelings are more important than hers.\n\nA proper punishment for lying (if she did) would be to apologize to her brother and you and have her be responsible for any setup/clean up for _both_ parties.  She made the decision to do two parties on her own, she can do the work for both parties.\n\nBut going forward, the standard should be two parties unless they decide to do something together...in which case both would have to agree to the joint party.  If one twin wants a separate party, they should get it.  They can still attend their siblings party if you have them on different days.", "YTA.   You are correct in your thought that 'forcing Paige to share her birthday celebration with Dylan might send the wrong message on that front.\"   You've dropped the ball here.  Do you really want to do this to Paige?  Really?  You do understand that what you seem to think will happen isn't actually going to happen.  \"Activities that all of their friends could enjoy.\"  Keep telling yourself that lie to make yourself feel better.", "ESH - Paige shouldn\u2019t have excluded Dylan but she also shouldn\u2019t be forced to have a party with her brother and miss out on time with her friends. \nWhy can\u2019t Dylan find something to do separate with his friends? Kinda sounds like Dylan\u2019s missing his sister.", "ESH, except Dylan. Paige should've had a conversation with her brother about this, but teenage boys and teenage girls like VERY different things. Doing a combined birthday party is silly at this point. You say you want to treat them as individuals, but a combined birthday is treating them as twins and nothing more. They will likely both be happier doing their own things for their birthday, Dylan just didn't piece it together as quickly as Paige did.", "ESH besides Dylan.\n\nPaige shouldn't have lied, and there should be consequences.  I think forcing her to share her birthday with Dylan could potentially a) lead to Dylan not enjoying his birthday as much if Paige has a bad attitude about it, essentially punishing him for his sister's lie and/or b) fostering resentment between Paige and Dylan.", "YTA", "I mean... It sounds more like Paige knew Dylan would object and she wouldn't get the party she wanted. \n\nPersonally, I hated having group parties with my brother. Our Birthdays are weeks apart. So it wasn't uncommon our folks would combine parties to save money. But all that stopped after he turned 10. \n\nFYI you did ruin her party. She didn't want to share with Dylan so you forced her to share to punish her. She shouldn't have lied, but you need to start thinking of your twins as individuals with individual wants/needs.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Because a teenage girl wanted to have a girl party but didn't run it past her brother first for his approval, it's canceled?!  Why do I think if the situation was reversed, you would be defending your son's actions to your daughter and he could have the party he planned for himself?  Sounds like your son's feelings mean more to you than your daughter's, \n\nUncancel Paige's party and let her have it as she planned.  Apologize to your daughter.  I think if more parents modeled how to own and rectify their mistakes for their children, we'd have a lot more mature adults and healthier relationships in this world.\n\n#", "YTA.  I'm a twin mom (mine turn 20 in 2 months).  Don't do this.  Not only because they're twins but don't give your daughter (or your son) the impression that she is responsible for managing his social comfort/is in charge of planning for his stuff.  Your son can also plan some a activities for his friends.  Maybe they can do something special for just the two of them besides their birthday gathering with friends.", "YTA. You say you've tried to treat your children as individuals but this shows that's not the case. Your daughter deserves the right to be her own individual person and to have her own party, whether she cleared it with her brother or not. It's not her place to ask permission from her brother to have her own birthday party. But at least Dylan's happy right?", "YTA. Twins, especially a boy and girl,  will eventually want to have their own identity. Having joint birthday parties after a certain age is basically refusing to acknowledge that you see them as individuals. 14 is plenty old enough to have separate celebrations.", "YTA. As an identical twin I have always shared birthdays with my sibling while we lived in the same area, but we\u2019ve always been best friends and had shared friend groups. Being that they are both 14 and have different friend groups, they should probably be having separate parties as now your daughter has made it clear that that\u2019s what she wants. With that being said, I think a sit down with your children would be better and let your daughter know what she did and how she went about communicating it wasn\u2019t  cool. You should definitely not force them to have a joint party though since I guarantee no one will end up happy in that case.", "NTA. The YTA votes are overlooking two key facts. The first is you\u2019ve always given your kids the choice between having a joint party or having individual ones. You don\u2019t force them to have joint parties. The second is that Paige lied to you. She must have known that Dylan wanted a joint party and instead of working it out with him or even asking you to mediate the disagreement, she lied to you to get what she wanted. That\u2019s not ok. If you let her have an individual party, you\u2019ll be teaching her that she can lie and disregard the feelings of others to get her way.", "YTA", "YTA they are 14 now not kids and being a girl and boy they will have different interests and friends. Especially if Paige and her friends are all girls it makes sense why they wouldn\u2019t want boys there. Yes Paige should\u2019ve talked to Dylan . But same goes for Dylan why was he expecting to share a party without talking to his sister. Maybe tell them both to communicate better. Listen to them both and go from there .", "YTA - I\u2019m a fraternal twin and while my sister and I shared a lot of birthdays growing up I would not expect to share them all especially at 14. Your son will get over this and you should not force them to have a party together or they will be miserable.\n\nThe lesson needs to be about communication on both your kids part.", "Why would this \"need\" to be a mutual decision.  Like, I get that it would be good to give her brother a heads up, but you're acting like she needed his permission.  \n\n\nIf she wants to do a party alone, and yeah, of course she does, 14F isn't the same as 14M, obviously, he doesn't need to agree, it's not up to him, he has no say; she doesn't need her brother's permission to not want a joint party, he doesn't have to be on the same page, it doesn't matter, he doesn't get to force a joint party and you are very much the AITA for punishing her here.  She's allowed to make this decision without consulting anyone, a heads up would have been nice, but it's not a punishable offense, she should be gently reminded to be a little more considerate but otherwise, like.... this is her choice, that she should be allowed to make, she told you, the person she had to tell, and that should have been enough.  \n\n\nYTA", "I don't want to call you an AH but you handled this situation wrong.  \n\nSuggestion of it's not to late. Tell them to go into a room and talk and come out with a decision.  The issue here was simply they didn't discuss it together. And instead of having them.discuss it you decided for them.", "I don't understand the Y T A votes.  The issue isn't having shared parties or separate parties.  The issue is that she lied in order to get the separate party. \nNTA.  You can't let her get away with lying.   She needs to learn that she can't lie her way into getting her way.", "ESH, I don't know what your daughter is thinking but it didn't work if she really wanted a separate party as much to warn Dylan from the beginning instead of lying. You are also TA because even if I understand your situation, forcing people to spend time together never works (I know it very well).", "Why didn\u2019t Dylan initiate a party conversation if a joint party is important to him? He clearly wasn\u2019t doing any planning himself. \n\nPaige should not have lied, but wanting to do her own thing sometimes should be welcomed and not seen as excluding him. They\u2019re twins, but they\u2019re still their own people with their own friends and interests.\n\nESH.", "ESH (except Dylan)\n\nPaige never should have lied and you for forcing them to share", "NTA - You are parenting.  She will naturally be upset.  The message you are sending is that it is not okay what she did.   It is not about treating them the same, it is about parenting in this situation.", "NTA since she lied to you, but you can certainly have handled it a different way. I really don\u2019t see how forcing them to have birthday party is gonna end up positive. It would be a lot more productive to make her apologize to him.\n\nYTA for requiring both of them to consent to have a different parties. This is pretty unfair because you\u2019re forcing the one who doesn\u2019t want to share a party to do so.

As twins most years they\u2019ve wanted to have a joint birthday celebration, but there have been a couple of years where they\u2019ve decided to have separate parties with different friend groups or at different locations. They tell me a few weeks before their birthday in May which thing they want to do that year. \n\nSo this year Paige told me that she and Dylan had decided they wanted to have their own parties, and she and her friends had already picked a whole theme and the activities that they wanted to do. I approved Paige\u2019s plan, and then a day or so later I asked Dylan what he wanted to do for his birthday party.\n\nAt this point I learned that Dylan and Paige had *not* mutually decided that they were having separate celebrations this year, and me asking Dylan about it was the first he was hearing that he was expected to have his own party. His feelings were very hurt that Paige had cut him out without so much as talking to him about it.\n\nSo I spoke with Paige and she admitted that she and her friends had decided on their own to exclude Dylan because they felt that a boy would wreck the activities they had planned. I told Paige that it wasn\u2019t okay for her to treat her brother that way and that the party I\u2019d originally agreed to was now cancelled, and that I expected her and Dylan to plan a joint birthday celebration with activities that all of their friends could enjoy.\n\nDylan is much happier with this arrangement, but Paige is angry and keeps saying that I ruined her party. I\u2019m worried that I might\u2019ve made a misstep because normally I try very hard to treat my kids as individuals and not just as a pair of twins, and I\u2019m worried that forcing Paige to share her birthday celebration with Dylan might send the wrong message on that front. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. I feel like you're missing an opportunity here to talk to Paige about why she found it necessary to lie, about why she didn't feel comfortable talking to her brother about her desire for separate plans, etc. 14 is an age when kids are supposed to be starting to pull away from their families to become their own people, but they don't have the emotional maturity to navigate that in a way that doesn't cause hurt to other people. Rather than punishing Paige by cancelling her party, why not sit down with her and find out what's going on, and talk about how to have difficult conversations and draw boundaries with other people in a way that is respectful to her own needs but not unnecessarily hurtful to others? That will be a much more useful skill that she can take with her into the rocky waters of young adulthood than resentment over an arbitrary punishment.", "YTA. Why do your sons feelings matter more than your daughters. Why can\u2019t she have her own things?", "YTA.  They are not a unit.  They are individuals.  Also sounds like you prefer your son and prioritize his wants.", "This is stupid, YTA. She\u2019s a teenage girl. It\u2019s okay she doesn\u2019t want to have a birthday party with her brother. You literally made a mountain out of a mole hill. Your prince is happy though, so all is right in the world.", "YTA. They're 14, not 4. They should be allowed to have their own individual parties. You're only going to make Paige resent her brother, and probably you as well.", "As a twin Softly YTA my parents made it a point to have us be in separate classes. Twins are two different people who need to feel free to express themselves more. I'm glad you know that. Parties only work if they both want to but your daughter doesn't and I would try to reframe it as wanting to express myself apart from my twin. It doesn't make our bond any less and this isn't a rejection. This is from the younger brother (Granted it's only a minute later lol) whose twin sister wanted her own things and she was denied a lot because of my comfort level and more withdrawn than her. This was hard for me to come to terms with initially around the teenage years but it honestly was for the best as it allowed me to find my depth and the new friends and able to find social fulfillment independent of my twin sister. I say this softly YTA just make sure you're not putting one twins comfort over the other this can breed resentment if this is a common dynamic.", "So Paige is not allowed to be her own person? She must always be tied to Dillons hip? I understand what she did was not nice. She should have talked to Dillon about it. \n\nBut are Dillon and his friends going to enjoy the same thing as 14 year old girls? Likely not. And at 14, the twins should naturally start enjoying their individuality. \n\nI have no problem with the cancelation of the party. Seems fitting. But stating she has to have her party with Dillon will embarrass her (overkill), and poor Dillon. He will have a sister with attitude at the party. \n\nI would have let Dillon have his own party. I probably reduced Paiges party to a sleep over without too much fanfare, or no party at all.\n\nBut i think you went hard on her for wanting to separate from her brother. The correct thing to go hard for her for is lying, and throwing her brother under the bus. I know you mentioned those things, but i get the impression you are more upset that she doesn't want to be a part of \"team twins\" antmore. They need space at this age. Not more togetherness.", "YTA. Paige lied and that needs to be addressed, but you do that by finding out why she lied. I have two kids, if they lie to me I find out why they felt they couldn\u2019t be honest. Sometimes it\u2019s the classic don\u2019t-want-to-get-in-trouble response, but other times it\u2019s because they worry I\u2019ll be disappointed or feel bad. The motivation is really important to know here: something made her feel like she couldn\u2019t even request her own party. \n\nTalk about the lie, decide an appropriate consequence but don\u2019t force her to share her party with someone. It\u2019s also going to make her brother look like a giant loser who\u2019s mommy is forcing kids to play with him. That\u2019s gonna hurt him socially at a crucial age.", "YTA\n\nAt 14, a shared party should require two yeses, not one yes and one no. Paige shouldn't be expected to ask her twin's permission. (Especially since they've done separate parties in the past.)\n\nYou've sent the message that when they disagree, Dylan's preference overrides Paige's, and used what should be an opportunity to celebrate them as a punishment.", "As a twin myself, YTA.\n\nIf one twin wants a separate party, they should be given the option. Yes Paige hurt Dylan by not speaking to him first, but at the same time it's pretty clear why she didn't - it seems likely that if Dylan got upset and spoke to you, you'd support Dylan and the joint party more than Paige and the separate party. By going to you first, she wanted to be heard ***as an individual*** and you still shut her down.  \n\n\n>I\u2019m worried that forcing Paige to share her birthday celebration with Dylan might send the wrong message on that front. \n\nYou are definitely sending the wrong message. Expect this to now be a point of contention for every 'joint' decision you make on their behalf, not just around birthdays.", "Also why does Paige have to be the project planner for this? If Dylan wants a joint party he should be asking for one, not assuming the people around him are going to do his own planning/emotional labor.", "This question going unanswered says a lot.", "Info: OP could you answer the question?", "Good question", "Op you need to answer this question.  Your silence is doing to say it all", "I wondered this too.", "This is the million dollar question, u/Fresh-Tower-8803.", "Paige should NOT be expected to check in with her brother about HER birthday party. Did Dylan check in with Paige? Did Dylan plan anything?\n\nSounds like the OP is putting all the pressure on Paige, including expecting Paige to share her friends and include her brother. \n\nThat\u2019s completely unfair on every single level.", "Actually, Paige lied and tried to manipulate her parent.  She's not a victim here.", "Very good point.", "This does seem reasonable, I think I may have overreacted a bit because Dylan was so hurt.", "OP, do a combined family party but then they each get their own separate friend party/celebrations. It sounds like your daughter has a clear party in mind. If your son just wanted to do an activity with a best friend or have someone over for a sleepover he could keep it simple if he doesn't want his own party.", "So... are you saying that manipulating people and telling lies for her own selfish purpose should be rewarded?", ">Why is it so important to your son to have the party together? Does he have friends of his own?\n\nHonestly, I think he was just upset about being excluded. He does have his own friends and would probably have been happy to have his own party if he hadn't been blindsided with it.", "Yes, but it\u2019s not reasonable to lie to get your way.", "Do you see how Paige might learn that lies and manipulation are the best way to get her own way?  If it ends up being no party for a dishonest liar, that might be an apt outcome.", ">And this is where girls learn that the world (even their mom) expects them to carry the emotional labor.\n\nTHIS!!\n\nOP, YTA. From what's been written, I'm extrapolating that if Dylan had wanted a joint party, but Paige wanted to have her own party, then they would have had to have a joint party. Paige didn't want that, but didn't think she could get it if she just said that she wanted her own party while her brother didn't. I do think there should be consequences for lying, but I don't think losing the party that she planned for her birthday is a proportional consequence.", "I have never read truer words. They each have the ability to want their own birthday party, just because they are twins doesn\u2019t mean they have to share and talk about every single birthday plans. They are growing up. OP says she treats them as individuals but I fail to see that here. \n\nYou can\u2019t tell me the son had no idea his birthday was coming and he needed to plan something if he wanted to celebrate. Teen girls are going to want to do teen girls stuff very likely they don\u2019t want boys involved. It is not up to the daughter to handle it for her brother. I have a feeling the daughter probably knew if she was straight forward, she would\u2019ve had to invite the brother because \u201cMom\u201d said so, and decided to omit the truth.", "That\u2019s not what happened. Paige lied to OP. She said that she and Dylan mutually agreed to have separate parties. Parents shouldn\u2019t reward their kids for lying.", "I think that's a bit out of line, no? It's not a gendered issue in that way, I'd have had the same reaction if Dylan and his friends were the ones excluding Paige.", "The girl lied and manipulated for her own selfish purpose.  This is where girls learn to be malignant narcissists.", "I'm with this comment 100%. Sure, Paige was wrong to pretend like she and Dylan had already discussed it. But the obliviousness on OP's part is astounding, especially since they claim to be aware of the whole \"twins get treated like one single person\" issue and try to avoid it.\n\nOP, your daughter is a teenager. She wants a birthday party catered to \\*her\\* interests, with only \\*her\\* friends, just like every single other person she knows gets. I'm shocked that this is a surprise to you. This is what most kids (heck, most ADULTS!) want. Instead, you're acting like if ONE of your twins wants to be joined at the hip, the other one HAS to comply or else it's an insult deserving of hurt feelings and punishment.\n\nIn fact, the status quo should actually be the opposite: if one twin wants more individuality, that request should automatically be honored. And the twin who might be feeling left behind or neglected should be lovingly parented to understand that even twins can have different interests and friend groups.\n\nI hope you can find your way to offering Paige an apology and helping her create a birthday party she really wants, instead of what you WANT her to want. You only have a couple more birthdays you get to celebrate during her childhood.", "A co-party should be a case of 2 yeses, 1 no.", "They're not being forced to share because Dylan wants to.  It's because Paige is trying to be a blossoming manipulative liar and her parent is trying to parent her.", "She has no obligation to tell her brother or ask his permission to have a separate party. And the way Mom was so worried about what Dylan wanted, I have a feeling that Paige had come to her mother and said she just wanted a separate party, mom would have asked Dylan first and if he said he wanted a joint party Mom would have made sure he had a joint party.", "I have a feeling we both know why Paige misled her mother. She knew that her mother would ask Dylan if he wanted a party with his sister and if he did he would have had it at Paige's expense. I wonder if Dylan even has friends and she's trying to force Paige and her friends to accept Dylan in their group.", "Paige needs to learn that telling lies and manipulating people is wrong.", "I get the feeling this isn\u2019t the first time Paige would be receiving that message", "The lying is probably because she knew if she had talked to Mom, Mom would have asked Dylan and Dylan would have said he wanted a joint party and he would have had a joint party.", "So... are you saying that manipulation and lying should just be ignored and OP's daughter should just get what she wants?", "How do you not see that telling lies to manipulate people is wrong?", "So you\u2019re ok with her daughter lying?", "Paige is being punished because she lied to her parent to get what she wanted. If she had told the truth, she would have been able to have the party she wanted", ">For Paige's lying, maybe not giving her any friend celebration would be more appropriate than making her share it with Dylan.\n\nNow that you say this, that actually seems really obvious. I don't know why I didn't think of that.", "OP said Dylan isn\u2019t hurt by his sister\u2019s desire for an individual party. He\u2019s hurt that she tried to blindside him with it instead of telling him upfront.", "She's not wrong for wanting her own thing, but she is wrong for lying about it. Should lying not have consequences?", "I'd say that maybe the exact phrasing doesn't matter if Paige was being manipulative or deliberately choosing words carefully so that \"technically\" she didn't lie.\n\nMaybe mom jumped to conclusions, maybe Paige was misleading.\n\nAnd helping with setup and cleanup of Dylan's party is genius-level natural consequences.", "I don't think Paige has any responsibility to have this conversation with her brother. She is an individual even though she's a twin. And she doesn't have to ask his permission or blessing to be an individual and want her own party. Should she have lied to her mother? No but I have a feeling that if she had come to her mother and expressed she wanted a party by herself, her mother would have asked Dylan his thoughts and if he said no to individual parties, Paige would have been forced to have a party with him anyway.", "I hear this line of thinking, but my concern is this: what I'm seeing is a strong preference in this family for these twins to agree on things. OP requires them to even agree on whether or not they're going to do a joint party! What I didn't hear mentioned was \"if one opted out and didn't want to, we wouldn't do the joint party.\" It was stated that they both agree to do it or they both agree not to do it. Not a lot of room for dissenting feelings.\n\nObviously I'm filling in blanks here, but the few facts that OP lays out makes me wonder if there were past birthdays where Paige didn't really \\*want\\* to share a birthday but felt forced to comply because Dylan insisted and/or OP maybe gently encouraged it that way. It feels like there's a lot of focus by OP on Dylan's hurt feelings. My radar is pinging that perhaps Paige tried other ways to have an individual party in the past, and got shut down, BEFORE she resorted to lying.\n\nLying isn't okay. At all. She needs to learn that lesson. Both kids also need to learn that it's okay to want something different from your sibling. It's okay to have interests, friends, and a celebration that's just about you. And they all REALLY need to learn that sometimes people's feelings get hurt if you don't agree with them or do what they want, but that doesn't automatically make you a bad person deserving of punishment.", "DING DING DING \n\nIf you allow her to go forward with her separate plan, you're telling her that lying is OK.", ">Tell them to go into a room and talk and come out with a decision\n\nIs this meant as serious advice?", ">The issue here was simply they didn't discuss it together\n\nSo in your world lying to her parent and deliberately excluding her brother without letting him know are positive actions?", "but that doesn't fit the naritive.  we stopped having joint parties for our  kids when they were 10 or 11.. but letting her have her own now is rewarding negative behavior and has nothing to do with her sex..", "exactly", "As a triplet I\u2019m very accustomed to it being OUR birthday and rarely MY birthday. That\u2019s fine, my siblings are my best friends. But every now and then I do have to remind people that I exist as an individual as much as I love being a triplet. The mom definitely needs to work on letting them be separate people because I doubt this is an isolated issue. Multiples will love being a multiple so long as they get to be individuals first.", "For what it's worth, I agree with you on this, but there is one thing I don't think you're taking into account. History matters, OP states that this has traditionally been a combined party. I will absolutely agree that at 14, the default should be separate, but it hasn't been previously, so Paige's conversation with her brother about the party is relevant to the situation at hand. I 100% agree that she should not have to ask his permission to have her own party, but being that the default (whether it should be or not) is a combined party, a conversation needed to be had if she wanted to separate it.", "Paige shouldn't have lied though.  Dylan was deprived of the chance to plan his own party.  Forcing her to share is not the right move either, I'd have thought a word about honesty would be valuable.  I'm wondering if Dylan is a bit clingy to Paige, or if the default is to have a joint party if one of them wants that.  \n\nSoft YTA OP,  you possibly should have checked in with Dylan on his party plan when Paige stated they had talked, but also forcing them to share gives a sense that spending time with Dylan is a punishment which won't help their relationship. \n\nI'd discuss the lying with Paige, why did she feel it was necessary? Offer communication options for the future. She coul still go to his party so he wouldn't be alone, so I'd also check in on Dylan more generally about his sense of independence. It should be OK for her to have her own birthday the way she wants it and shouldn't need to lie.", "Nope the fact she felt she had no other choice but to lie to try and get a different celebration is sad. \n\nMom is going to make her resent her brother. It\u2019s ok for the two of them to have 2 different celebrations.  \n\nMom is crushing her daughter to make her son happy. This is not right.", "Playing devils advocate and considering how mom overreacted because the brother was hurt maybe Paige figured that\u2019s the only way she had a chance to get a celebration by herself. \n\nNot saying what she did was right but at 14 you don\u2019t think thing\u2019s through.", "They are old enough to have separate parties by default.  She shouldn't have to ask her brother to get her own party.", "What was Dylan\u2019s plan for the birthday? It\u2019s only a few weeks away. Had he discussed any ideas with Paige?", "They're old enough to regulate that. I find it disturbing that you're more ok with your daughter's unhappiness than your son's. She probably wouldn't have felt the need to lie unless she knew you would favor him. Ask her about that before you reject what I'm saying.", "So you parent him through it.", "She shouldn't have to ask him.  They're individuals.  Start treating them that way.", "It sounds like your using the joint birthday as punishment then that he probably didn\u2019t even want. It sounds bad", "This will probably get down voted but I wish parents didn't assume siblings are friends... Sometimes they aren't and in middle school we all wanted to hang out with our friends.", "He should not get to dictate what his sister gets to do. \n\nYour teaching your daughter that mean get to tell you what you should do. And be a good little girl and do what the man wants.that you need a man\u2019s permission. \n\nIs this what you want to teach her daughter.", "Why didn\u2019t he ask his sister ? Why is it her responsibility to ask him?", "Sounds like your daughter is tired of doing all the planning to accommodate her brother when they can BOTH have equally fun, but separate parties.", "Why is Paige responsible for lending her friends to him? This is really fkd up.", "Did he bother to ask his sister? Just because your daughter is a girl it\u2019s not her job to plan Dylan\u2019s life for him.", "Sounds like Paige has to lie because the OP clearly favors Dylan and his happiness.", "And she *should* be punished for lying. But taking away her party is overkill.   \n\nIs op going to punish her for not planning a party she doesn't want?  For not coming to a party she doesn't want?", "She\u2019s 14 years old and wants her own birthday party with her own friends. She shouldn\u2019t have to clear it with her brother first. Yes she lied, but I can see why she felt the need to lie given she\u2019s 14 and still \u201cstuck\u201d with this system.

And is OP going to punish her for not participating in planning a new party? For not inviting anyone? For staying in her room instead of being at a party she doesn't want? For not being happy at said party if she is forced to attend?\n\nEdit edit: also why is is up to Paige to plan a *joint* party.

You're overreacting.", "The fact that your daughter had to lie to you about checking in with her brother first says it is.

Have you stopped to think for a moment that maybe Dylan just isn't at that stage in his development where he's seeking out the level of independent individualization that his sister is? \n\nWhat if your daughter didn't exclude Dylan from the party she had planned, but because she had done all the planning and he didn't approach her himself to contribute and collaborate with her ( not her asking him or having to okay everything with him while he did whatever he was doing on the sidelines.)

It gets hard when you don't always want to do shit with your wombmate and being a teen and trying to articulate your feelings but not hurting the other", "See last sentence of my post.\n\nPaige should be punished for lying, not for wanting a separate party.", "Bro get off this thread and calm yourself.", "Don't do this.  It will only build resentment.", "Absolutely hitting home the point the son is the golden child. Then she is going to resent him for being the reason her birthday is being ruined.", "So no celebration for her? Ouch.", "You're parenting wrong. That's too extreme for a little lie. Clearly Paige has no confidence in you as a paternal figure. You need to do some serious self evaluation.", "This will be just digging yourself in deeper.", "Do not use a birthday party as punishment for what was a relatively small offense. While lying is not good, you need to address why she felt compelled to lie. I would hazzard a guess that she told you that she didn't want a joint party but didn't know what he wanted. The result would be that he would get the deciding vote. Exactly like he did.", "At this point I think you\u2019re grasping at straws to not have to back track and lose face for what you\u2019ve forced on her. \n\nYes she lied but to cancel her entire birthday party over something she shouldn\u2019t have even been placed in the position to lie over is pretty ridiculous. It should never have been assumed they\u2019d be having celebrations together. The default should have been separate. And perhaps as the *parent* you should have had discussions with them about what they wanted well in advance instead of making them figure it out alone. Did you discuss why she felt she needed to lie about it? I feel like there is probably more to the story, but, regardless, canceling her part of the birthday celebration is extreme and sure to breed resentment between the siblings and with you and her.", "Wow... You just jump to one overeaction right to another... \n\nI can see why Paige felt the need to lie.", "It's absolutely insane that you're punishing a 14-year-old for trying to foster some independence. You're on track to get cut out of your kid's life in about 4 years.", "Exactly. He is hurt either way and this a chance to have his feelings heard and validated the same goes for his sister", "Yes she's wrong for lying, and there should be consequences. She should have been upfront with her brother about her plans.Forcing her to have a party she doesn't want will mean that nobody enjoys it and it then the resentment starts.- it then means effectively everyone is punished.", "Her brother was under the impression that they were having a joint birthday party. I agree that she doesn't need his approval to have her own party, it should be a 2 yes 1 no situation to combine them, but I think it's a little shitty that she didn't bother to tell him that she didn't want to.", "Yup. They're 14 the problem here isn't having a joint party or separate parties. It's because Paige didn't bother to tell her brother how she felt. I get the feeling if they just talk it out he'll understand and have his own party.  \n\nIf OP just agree with Paige and say separate parties Dylan feels bad. You do the opposite Paige feels bad. \n\nHave them talk to each other and it be their decision. Most likely they'll come up with one that will make both of them happy", "As a twin couldn't agree more", "I mean, Paige would've been right to say, \"Hey, I don't want a joint party this year,\" to her mother, without mentioning Dylan (or with specification that she hasn't talked to Dylan). The problem is that she acted as if she had already talked to Dylan, and then OP accidentally blindsided him. I can imagine maybe she didn't know how else to approach the subject, but it's the lie that was unfair.", "Nope. She says that t least a couple of times they\u2019ve had separate parties, so not out of the blue.  Paige should have at least given her brother a heads up just to be nice, but she shouldnt be forced into another joint party\u2026especially at their ages.", "Post says both kids have had individual parties in the past without issue. Paige should have talked to Dylan instead of excluding him while letting him think it was going to be a joint party.", "She's also old enough to not lie to her parents or maliciously and deliberately exclude her brother without even having the decency to tell him.\n\nEven if we go with your somewhat crazy theory of \"she shouldn't be expected to talk to her sibling that she lives in the same house as\", all she had to do was tell her parents that she didn't want a joint party.\n\nPeople with good intentions don't deceive their siblings and parents.", "She didn\u2019t have to ask him but she did have to tell the truth. She should have just said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what Dylan wants but I want my own party\u201d.", "I haven't seen anyone (outside of OP) even imply she should ask him. However, being that combined parties is the norm, it's not outside the realm of reason to expect her to tell him she didn't want to do that this year.", "OP\u2019s daughter name is Paige not Kate. She had no reason to lie. Dylan has his own friends and OP gives them the choice between a joint party and individual ones. According to OP, Dylan said he have been fine with doing individual parties but he\u2019s hurt that Paige blindsided him when it wasn\u2019t necessary", "She\u2019s not stuck with any system. Read the post again. OP gives her kids the choice between joint and individual parties. The lying wasn\u2019t justified", "Actually, Paige tried to prove to her family and friends that she can tell lies and manipulate people for her own selfish purposes and her brother is totally irrelevant and far less important than she is.  Also, she will learn that **she can *expect* to get away with it** because she's a girl.", "Did you forget the part where Paige lied to OP? Shouldn\u2019t there be a consequence for that?", "Incel boi is putting this manipulation comment under every yta comment. It's getting really old reading it.", "Ah.  Abuse.  Mmhmm.", "'It' is a pubescent girl.  About to grow into a young adult.  Moving up into a full-blown grown-up and it's part of OP's job to get her there with an honest character.  Letting lying slide won't do it.  \n\nIgnoring lies and manipulation in any child at any age is not doing the child a long-term favour.  If you don't believe me you're welcome to ask a therapist.", "Yeah, this guy is on a watchlist somewhere for sure", "Is OP being truthful though? I think not. \n\nKids usually don't lie when the most likely answer is going to be yes. If it wasn't that big a deal to Dylan to have a separate party, he wouldn't have been sad about not being asked. Annoyed maybe, but not sad.\n\nPaige likely knew what the outcome would have been. And frankly, at 14, she shouldn't be having to ask her brother to have a separate party.", "I understand the conversations.  I also understand that 14 is about the age that girls start trying to use manipulation to get what they want without any of that messy stuff like negotiation and compromise.  It's part of a parent's job to raise their child with a good, sound character.  Letting manipulation slide doesn't work towards that goal.\n\nFrom OP's post it sounds like all Paige had to do was get together with OP and Dylan and say she wanted her own girl's party with girl stuff and both OP and Dylan would have been ok with it and there was no need to lie about it at all.", "So you\u2019re justifying her lying. Got it. If I was the parent I\u2019d have just told her no party at all for lying. There\u2019s a way to teach your kids communication, like teaching Paige she needs to come to her mom and say \u201cI\u2019d like a solo party. I\u2019m not sure how Dylan will react. Can we all work together on it.\u201d But Paige is already developing bad habits. Forcing a combined party isn\u2019t the answer, but Paige shouldn\u2019t get to have her way for the lying alone.", "Except there\u2019s a way for Paige to actually communicate that she doesn\u2019t want a joined party without lying. If she said to her mom, \u201cI want a solo party and I don\u2019t know how Dylan will react, but my friend group has a bunch of stuff we\u2019ve discussed that\u2019s a girls party\u201d and her mom told her no, the mom would be TA. I don\u2019t think responding to Paige\u2019s lie by forcing a joint party is the answer, I think telling her she can have a cake and presents at home with family and try to be honest next year.", "The lying and the separate party go hand in hand. The purpose of a punishment is to teach the child a lesson. Let\u2019s say OP revokes some of Paige\u2019s privileges for a week or so as punishment but still lets her have the individual party, the one she lied to her parent and blindsided her brother to have. How does she learn from that. She still got what she wanted in spite of her actions so she would have learned nothing.", "I mean, she could have had no party at all. If I had pulled that stunt with my parents then we wouldn't haven't been celebrating at all. No ones forcing anything, if she truly has no desire for a joint party she doesn't have to participate", "Based on nothing, though, except his own assumptions. He didn't ask her what she wanted to; he can also initiate conversations about their birthday.", "Paige lied to OP to get what she wanted. She knew Dylan wasn't happy with this plan, so she lied to her mom. If Paige wants to exclude Dylan, while Dylan wants a shared birthday, talking isn't gonna result in a solution that makes them both happy. I would agree if Paige didn't lie, but I think mum's hand was somewhat forced here", "But my thing is it should be normal to have separate parties at their age. Dylan should not expect a combined party.  \n\nIf they want a combined party great but it should not be expected by brother or mom.\n\nI am amazed mom and brother are shocked that a bunch of 14 year old girls don\u2019t want to hang out with the brother and his friends.", "She\u2019s 14, I don\u2019t think maliciously and deliberately excludes are correct. She\u2019s still figuring out how to balance her wants with her brothers and she was selfish, sure. But you write this as if she has the thought process of an adult. At 14 your figuring out identity so she lied because she really wanted to do her own thing. It can be a teachable lesson without taking away her individualism. Conversations and a apology would have been enough. She didn\u2019t murder him.", "Or maybe she felt she had to because if her brother wanted a joint party, her mom would have forced her to.  \n\nAnd yes I stand by my statement that she doesn't need her brother's permission to have her own party.  She shouldn't even need to ask. They should have separate parties by default.  It's ridiculous that isn't the case.", "This is definitely the ideal response, so\u2026 why didn\u2019t she say that? I suspect OP is not as chill about separate celebrations as she\u2019s trying to portray.", "That\u2019s what\u2019s so fkd up\u2026 it shouldn\u2019t be the default that Paige is expected to share a birthday party with her brother.", "The Daughter has no choice.\n\n\"I want my own party\"\n\"No\" \n\nI doubt this is the first year it's been a problem for the daughter.", "lol, I did read the post again and keep seeing the word \u201cthey\u201d, as if both of them have to agree for anything different to happen. The daughter has made it clear she wants her own birthday party (albeit, not using the best approach). Quite frankly, that should be the end of it. The fact that the brother had any say in the matter is what is so wrong here.\n\nI also love how you keep talking about OP rewarding her daughter. Its not a reward, its her birthday and (in my opinion) that should be a right at her age. OP has every right to punish her daughter, but do it by grounding her or forgoing an allowance. FORCING her to share a birthday is ridiculous imo", "And again, she *should* be punished for lying.  But taking away her party is overkill.\n\nIs op planning on punishing her for not participating? For not being happy about it?  For not bothering to show up or invite any of her friends?", "Yeah, but it shouldn't be taking away her party and forcing her to have one with the brother, that is extreme.  They're teenagers.  It was cute when they were 5.  It's ridiculous now.", "Hmmmm... I wonder if it could be that the yta comments completely overlook how dishonest Paige was and even want her rewarded for almost getting away with it.  'Dylan' is irrelevant.", "If you think that\u2019s abuse\u2026\u2026..", "okay so you definitely used the wrong name but still you can\u2019t infer things you don\u2019t know and  treat that as fact. you also don\u2019t know how he feels, being a twin it must be especially hurtful to be blindsided. didn\u2019t say she should either but i think lying to get your way shouldn\u2019t be rewarded or did you not miss the part where they\u2019ve had separate parties in the past.", "So one twin gets a party and the other gets to only spend time with the family cause she's a teen and led about wanting to do a joint party?! Naw. That's another overreaction.  She didn't go out and get schwasted and get caught.  Maybe she gets her party but not so all the things she wanted to do.", "Based on history", "I\u2019m really surprised how many commenters are wrapped around the axle of this lie. In the grand scheme of teenage lies, this barely moves the needle.", "OP said that they have had separate parties before, it's not as is she's terrified of breaching new ground - this topic has already come up before and was presumably handled far more maturely by all involved.\n\nAgain, nobody is taking away anyone's individualism. By all appearances they have both had had joint and individual parties before without the sudden need to lie to their parents and go behind the other's back.", "I mean if we're just inventing scenarios in our heads and pretending that that fantasy is reality, I'll just say that Paige is being controlled by an evil ring made by a dark wizard thousands of years ago.\n\nIn case you missed this on the very first line written by OP:\n\n>As twins most years they\u2019ve wanted to have a joint birthday celebration\n\nIf this is what they BOTH want to do MOST of the time, then that is a very reasonable default. Nobody is demanding that she gets her brother's permission to do anything. You're being very melodramatic.\n\nAnd stop pretending that it's some great unreasonable burden to just say \"hey can I have my own party this year?\" to two people she shares a house with? I can't believe I'm having to say this, but lying like that is a deliberate and calculated act that should not be rewarded.", "Me to I think the son is the golden child give how mom has reacted. And being upset his feelings got hurt. And given she can\u2019t do her own thing unless he agrees", "OP should definitely have a conversation with their kids to understand their wishes going forward and see if it\u2019s something they can handle. Obviously the current arrangement isn\u2019t working. However I don\u2019t think that Paige should be rewarded for lying. You can\u2019t give your kids the impression that they can lie and manipulate to get you to change the rules", "The default is the kids get a choice. They can have a joint party or an individual one. Paige lied about what Dylan wanted. Why is that not getting through to you?", "That\u2019s not what happened. She said she and her brother agreed to have separate parties and that was a lie. The problem here isn\u2019t that she wants her own party. It\u2019s that she lied and didn\u2019t give her brother a heads up about her choice. She manipulated her parent and blindsided her brother. You don\u2019t get rewarded for that", "OP never said they had to be in agreement. Even the brother said he didn\u2019t care if Paige wanted her own party. The problem is she tried to be sneaky about it for no reason.", "How would you punish her? \"Of course you can have your party Paige, you would have gotten away with it if that pesky boy hadn't been so upset\"?\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure why Paige is having any kind of party at all, except as a guest at her brother's.", "She\u2019s still having a party. It\u2019s just not the one she wants. If OP had given Dylan an individual party and told Paige she couldn\u2019t have a party at all, that would have been extreme. You can\u2019t reward kids for crappy behavior. The punishment fits the crime", "I did, and I fixed it. \n\nBeing a twin doesn't figure into it. At 14, they're figuring out their independence. Most want their own party with their own friends. If just going up to OP and saying \"This is what I want to do for my birthday.\" without a challenge, she would have.\n\nBut, OP's \"punishment\" was to have a force a co-party as \"a punishment\". That tells me all I really need to know about if one twin didn't want a separate party. \n\n OP also thought that Paige not having a party was a good \"alternative\" punishment in another comment. OP seems incredibly harsh. It's a white lie that deserved some extra chores or an apology note to her brother. Not ruining her whole birthday.\n\nI'm not saying Paige was right, I'm saying I can read between the lines of why she lied.", "Rewarding someone for lying by giving them what they want teaches them lying gets them what they want.", "I agree that\u2019s why I think a lot of YTA votes talk about OP putting her sons needs over her daughters because it seems the punishment is for making him upset over the actual lie.", "She\u2019s a kid, it\u2019s weird she felt the need to lie and I think OP should be questioning that. An apology and a conversation would work way better then forcing a joint birthday party when op also says in comments that her son has his own friends and probably would have been fine with separate parties. \n\nAlso if she has been truthful and ops son said he wanted it joint, I have a feeling op would have said joint it is.", "If he was the Golden Child OP would have asked him about his plans after Paige brought it up.  I think OP just dropped the ball which happens.  They trusted their kid and seems a bit thrown.  There may be other issues in play or it may just be a busy house with teens in it.", "When teenagers lie, I think it behooves the parents to ask themselves if the rule or expectation that prompted the lie is fair and reasonable. I\u2019m obviously not condoning lying to one\u2019s parents, but *in this situation*, I think the reason behind the lie is the more important issue.", "I guess the issue is, would Paige have got her own party if she had been honest? If not, OP is TA.  \nI think you can still let the kid have a birthday and punish them in a different way.", "There\u2019s clearly a reason why Paige felt she needed to lie. My guess is that the OP favors and defaults to Dylan. \n\nThe lie should be addressed and hopefully the OP listens to Paige, but something tells me they won\u2019t.", "But she didn't lie about what she wanted. She gave her choice and obviously felt the need to lie for whatever reason and OP did exactly what Paige was clearly trying to avoid, probably why she lied in the first place.", "I can sort of see your point, but to me the problem is  why does the daughter feel she needs to lie to have her own party? \n\nThe son had made no plans with his own friends. It's all a bit odd to me. 14 yr old me's ideal birthday would not be chilling with my sister and her friends....", "Like you punish any 14yo? Take away their phone for a set time, ground them for a set time, or extra chores.", "But this punishment doesn't fit the crime. That is what you are not getting.", "except you literally do not know that. for all you know paige just figured it\u2019s easier this way. how hard was it to sit down mom and brother and say hey i think i want to not do a joint party this year. there is nothing wrong with dylan thinking they may since they\u2019ve done it before but they\u2019ve also done separate parties. i am fully camp esh except for dylan. mom should always do two parties going forward unless both twins come forward and say they want a joint party and paige should learn that lying doesn\u2019t get you what you want.", "Honestly,  i think you're too focused on that she lied and not on what she lied about.  Most teen girls would not want the same party as a teen boy.  And you want to punish her for trying to celebrate her birthday the at she wanted to.  Did she go about it correctly? No. But talk to the kids.  Communicate.  Help teach her how to behave and discuss this in the future.  It's her birthday party. It's not just arandom ass slumber party or event.", "I am not saying your wrong but here is my take. It shouldn\u2019t be about trusting the kids. It should be sister is doing y what do you want to do. One kid should not get to decide what the other does for the birthday. \n\nHaving a different parties at their age should be the norm. Sister should not have to run her plans by her brother or vise versa.", "I agree that when kids act out, the parents should ask themselves if there\u2019s something that they did to influence the behavior. However the child shouldn\u2019t be left off the hook for the part they played. You don\u2019t want to give your kids the impression that they can break the rules and guilt trip you into letting them off the hook.", "Paige has had individual parties in the past. She hasn\u2019t been deprived. She lied because she\u2019s a teenager and teenager scheme to her what they want even when there\u2019s not reason to do that.", "She lied about what her brother wanted. I can\u2019t believe people are actually defending lying considering the serious consequences of lying in the adult world. This is the stage of life where people learn that dishonesty isn\u2019t ok", "She\u2019s a teenager. When they decide they want something, when they want something their default action is to lie to get it. That\u2019s why OP shouldn\u2019t let her have the party. This is the time in life where kids test limits. They want to see how far they can go without suffering consequences. Today she\u2019s lying about the party and then a few months from now she\u2019ll lie about something bigger. The behavior will escalate if you don\u2019t stop it as soon as it starts.", "Someone suggested that OP shouldn\u2019t let Paige have a party at all this year and let Dylan have an individual party if he wants one. Would you have had a problem with that? When you kids do the wrong thing you shouldn\u2019t reward them.", "How hard was it to sit them down and say that? Apparently, hard.\n\nIf it was that easy, that's what exactly Paige would have done. So,why didn't she?\n\nIn the post:\n\n> Dylan is much happier with this arrangement.\n\nThat does not sound like Dylan \"didn't care\". Sounds like he wanted a joint party and would have told Paige no. Hence, the lie she had to tell because she would have been told no. \n\nI also said that Paige wasn't right and that she should be punished but not to the degree OP did or wants to. \n\nI don't say E S H because I don't think OP is being fully truthful. I think that if Paige had been honest, OP would have forced the co-party anyway if that's what Dylan wanted so he wouldn't feel left out.", "There are other punishments though.  Like Paige having to do the work for Dylan's party, or being grounded,or writing an essay on open communication, or something.   Using Dylan as a punishment perpetuates the cause of the lying.", "Lol are you the OP?", "I'm not defending it but you are acting as if this was a huge outrageous lie. We ALL tell little lies, especially adults. I lied about liking my bosses in an interview the other day. She lied, yeah, she needs to have a discussion about how lying about this convo hurt her brothers feelings. But OP has yet to respond to the people asking what happens when the kids want separate things for their parties, leading us to start to wonder why Paige felt the need to lie. You're acting as if teens are constant liars, they aren't. Some people lie more than others, kids may test boundaries in certain ways. The problem here is there's missing reasons vibes and OP won't answer those people asking those probing questions. So yeah, we have more sympathy for the child it seems is the less favored.", "So she's forced to have her friends socialise with her brothers friends to celebrate her birthday?.... Maybe they don't want to do that and that's why they made their plans..... \n\nThe son shouldn't have a say if she has a solo party or not to begin with then she wouldnt have had to lie....", "Then, ground her. Take away her phone for a few days. Forcing her to have a joint party that will get ruined because she is a 14 year old teenager is pushing it too far. \n\nHave you been around teenage girls? Drama!

This was a lie designed to manipulate whatever rules OP has regarding birthday parties. You won\u2019t get fired for pretending to like your former employer in a job interview but you will be disciplined for telling your boss a lie in order to get around a company policy, even if that policy is unfair. I don\u2019t think teenagers are pure evil but I know that the teen years is the time when kids test limits and when they cross a line it\u2019s the parents job to check the behavior.", "She\u2019s not being forced to do anything.

Not only that but my degree is in psychology and my focus area was children and adolescents. Based on all of that experience and knowledge, I can say with certainty that taking Paige\u2019s phone away won\u2019t teach her anything. You would have still gotten what she wanted. You don\u2019t want to give kids the impression that if they don\u2019t like the rules they should lie and manipulate to get their way."]}
