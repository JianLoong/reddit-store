Your son is only four months old, which tells me that your MIL didn\u2019t even *wait* after your husband asked her to hold off a minute while you figured things out. Is there any way to contact the relevant government department and have your account set as the primary one, as the child\u2019s parents?", "NTA. You should look into whether or not you can switch the primary account. This seems like a fundamental thing- the fact that she doesn\u2019t seem to understand this is strange. If you\u2019re choose to contribute to her account, make sure you are NAMED in the account so she can\u2019t do anything without your approval or knowledge. You don\u2019t want her to have leverage or control over money you contribute.", "NTA. Your MIL is overstepping her boundaries.\n\nAlso wondering how your MIL is able to set up the account because where I am, only the legal persons (usually the parents) are allowed to perform administrative actions for the child.", "INFO:\n\nAre they restricting your access/ability to contribute to the primary RESP savings account? As in, if you ask them for the credentials to the account to monitor and contribute, will they say no?\n\nDo they not plan on contributing less than $7200 CAD into the account (maximum the government will contribute as a match)?", "NTA. That is not her place. She's is not the parent. Not her v\nChoice to make. How did she open it if she didn't have a social? Or is that not needed.", "Jeez. To me the particular action doesn\u2019t even matter. The fact that she asked and went against your explicit wishes is a huge problem. You and DH will have to determine what the consequences will be if she crosses that boundary again and then follow through. Oof. \n\nNTA", "NTA and I find your MIL's actions highly suspicious. Seems like she is planning some scheme to keep the money for herself.", "I N F O. Are you allowed to contribute to that account to so that it has the maximum amount? Or can you just give your MIL money to do so?\n\n\\----\n\nEdit for updated weigh in: \n\nNTA. I understand that because you are the primary provider for your child, you want the main account under your name. That's justified and logistically easier for you as parents, as opposed to giving the money to your MIL.\n\nI agree, your MIL jumped the gun and should've respected your wishes to hold off on creating the account while you and your wife studied it more. But I can't tell based on your story if she went rogue because of malicious intent (e.g., she wants to show you up), or if she's just an overzealous grandma.\n\nAt any rate, seems like a bigger conversation should be had on how to approach the account in the future (could it be transferred to you, or funds moved to the account you made?) and boundaries on raising your child.", "NTA\n\nYou should contact the government and ask them if there is any recourse for an unauthorized non-custodial individual to control the primary RESP account for your own child.

I gather from other commenters who know about RESP that, in the end, all the money ends up with your son anyway but that's beside the point right now.
