Going the route of comparing them to their mother and in an extremely negative way is the exact opposite of productive. \n\nYou may be absolutely right, but that\u2019s not how you say it *at all*.

That rule is:if you are going to eavesdrop then you are responsible for managing all your own feelings about what you hear. If you can\u2019t manage your own feelings about what you hear then do not eavesdrop. I don\u2019t eavesdrop because to me what others think of me is none of my business.

You should stand up for yourself whenever this happens, and your partner should be supporting you. Otherwise your relationship is doomed. I think your MIL leaving early because of what she overheard is an early Christmas present to you. You are allowed to have a private conversation with your partner. If MIL chooses to listen in, it is on hear if she hears something she doesn't like. All in all I think you and your partner may have to reconsider re having MIL living in the house. It doesn't sound harmoneus or if it is a good situation to be raising your kids in.", "Man get rid of all of them, that's your home.

And you don't feel bad about that? If I overheard my child's partner saying that, I'd be taking everyone and leaving, not just the one kid I take care of! It wouldn't even be because you're insulting me, but you're insulting *my daughter???* I'm not sure how this part is getting swept under the rug. It's not about how MIL has been behaving, it's how she reacted to this horrible thing you said.\n\nYTA  \n\n\nETA: Coming back to this, it's crazy how bad you've managed to deflect from the title of your post. Your MIL left thanksgiving because yes, she overheard you calling your daughter selfish, just like her. I wonder how many other people missed this because you spent most of it complaining about her being a bit of an annoying housemate. Masterful framing of the issue.", "I also have a cluster B disorder and sometimes having things out of place can trigger executive dysfunction and emotional distress levels that are imbalanced with the issue, having things a particular way literally helps me function and my partner and I have had many conversations about how this affects both of us. I ended up making a rudimentary map for him to refer back to so that he can remember, and I try to manage my emotions effectively when things are different than I\u2019m expecting. This requires both people to understand and value the difference of neurodivergence and neurotypical mindsets. I understand why you were frustrated, and I hope you can find some common ground to talk about these subjects with. It\u2019s definitely challenging to navigate and it might be that you communicate ways that don\u2019t make sense to one another, not that you\u2019re diametrically opposed", "That\u2019s correct about me. I said I felt she was selfish and sucked at communication", "Yeah I didn't notice at first cuz the post kinda glosses over it? Which kinda makes it worse. \"You're selfish and just like your mom,\" is a nuke level thing to say to your partner. The fallout from that *should* be enough to overshadow MIL's reaction.", "OP doesn\u2019t know if MIL overheard or if she was in fact eavesdropping. If you want to talk smack about someone who lives with you, make sure they aren\u2019t around and be quiet about it.  Being on the porch doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be heard.

If it\u2019s truly how I feel then why should I have to whisper? I was not being loud and I\u2019ve been in my kitchen before with people on my porch.

It feels she creates these weird scenarios she knows will annoy me.", "I\u2019m just saying it that labeling it eavesdropping  automatically put the other person in a negative light when it can just be a case of someone just overhearing.  However it happened, MIL is managing her feelings by getting out of the situation and processing it.  But you want control that too.  It\u2019s probably already hard for her to have to live with you, who,  even when she helps, it\u2019s not done the specific way or that everything has it\u2019s place.  How does one live and relax in a home that they are only welcome if the soap dispenser is a certain way.   Is she guest or is she a member of the household? If you are coparenting kids, there will be disagreements.
