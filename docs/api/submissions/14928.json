You shouldn't have to sit there and let this man make you feel uncomfortable. Maybe if he was less creepy he and his grandkids wouldn't have been kicked out. Not your fault.", "NTA. It is uncomfortable to have someone stare at you who won\u2019t look away and is clearly not a socially acceptable thing to do. Not sure what this guy\u2019s intentions are so can\u2019t say he\u2019s the AH, but it is perfectly valid to feel uncomfortable in a situation like this. Not sure if the outburst was necessary, you could have sat at a table facing the other direction away from this man, but at the same time women should be able to exist without being stared at", "NTA - Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Manager could have handled that better by a) saying something when up close if he knows the guy has form and b) not coming out and saying \"get out\" so loud to other customers. The second point instantly makes you a target unfairly", "NTA about the situation but I\u2019m a bit confused about the part where you texted your husband when you said a bit earlier you made sure you weren\u2019t left alone. Where did he go?", "NTA, btw who was the one that told you that your were the a hole?", "NTA but until you said that the manager had to kick the guy out before I thought he might have been blind \n\nStill could be, but seems unlikely. Then would you really be TA if he was?", "Well, you're obviously not an asshole if management informed you of a pattern with this man harassing other female customers in the restaurant. Don't feel too bad, maybe you were the one who got off easy, you never know if the other women he was staring at got followed or groped. At least he was the one asked to leave before he did something perverted or scary to you.", "NTA As a kid, we'd yell, \"Take a picture, it lasts longer\" if someone stared like that. As an adult, I learned that this is frequently a sign of sexual addiction as they are locked into their fantasy world. It is creepy behavior regardless of the reason. Trust your instincts as your body/mind senses danger more subtly.", "You know, I thought maybe he\u2019s getting dementia, has mental health issues, then I thought surely if that was the case he wouldn\u2019t be out with 4 children by himself.", "I love this so much.", "You\u2019re right. The outburst probably wasn\u2019t necessary. But maybe it was a good thing since it got the manager\u2019s attention. Also if you knew how much courage it took for me to say something you\u2019d be proud.", "I was told it\u2019s illegal for them to remove him from the restaurant?

You don't just do that for looking at someone a little too long.", "Why didn\u2019t you want the rude AH to hear he was a rude AH?", "Thank you for validating my feelings.", "Because I\u2019m 30 & don\u2019t have enough self confidence to be confrontational \ud83d\ude02", "You\u2019re welcome!  :)\n\nThat took guts standing up for yourself and calling that guy out.  Well done!", "Well, I\u2019m glad you managed to say something in the end and I do hope the experience and the NTA votes help you to learn standing up for yourself sooner.
