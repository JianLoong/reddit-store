I'll be frank. Your puppy is going to wind up dead. Your kid and husband and anyone else in the crossfire maimed or dead if anything goes wrong. And that likelihood is high.

Actually, large dogs being *super* friendly around young kids is also a warning sign they can knock them over! Still, the super friendliness is not the sort of concern most people think about. An overly exuberant lab knocking over a toddler and making her cry doesn't typically end in maiming. Whereas, if a dog is super people shy, that does suggest they are more likely to misinterpret the actions of people around them and act to protect themselves. I have a *very* bitey Papillion, came from a really bad situation. She is very people-shy for that reason. She's even bitten me straight in the face once because she acted instinctively before she knew it was me! I watch her like a hawk around strangers, and I never let anyone under the age of 12 be around her... and she's 10 pounds. She's dog aggressive as well. I would be so super cautious if I had two very large dogs that were people-shy and dog-aggressive. I would never have them around kids. Hell, I wouldn't have them in big gatherings at all, period. I can afford to be a little less vigilant because my dogs are so small (10 and 7 pounds, respectively), but you really cannot when they are large dogs.

Dogs are dogs.  And I love them.  But regardless of how well trained your or others dogs are things can happen.   You need to be ready to deal with it to protect your dog and the other.  Sheltering them away from everything is the only solution and in my opinion it\u2019s not an acceptable one.  Now protecting your current puppy from the situation as it\u2019s a crucial time in socialization of a dog does carry some weight. \n\nSecondly I genuinely respect your concern as a mother and parent but have some things I view differently.  \n\nI am trying not assume you have bias against pitbulls but it\u2019s hard.  But let\u2019s ignore that fact and just let them be dogs.   \nThey have no bite history and are not aggressive towards strangers just weary and aloof.  That to me says they aren\u2019t going to go out of their way to find trouble with your daughter.  From my experience if they don\u2019t like people much and you put them in one area or room they will stay there and be very content with avoiding the annoyance of people.  But still a closed door can be managed.   Even by those drinking. And I\u2019d bet one might get out once but seeing as I\u2019d bet the owners are semi responsible dog owners unless that thing is on a war path (rare for even mildly behaved dogs) a loud command or an aggressive correcting collar pull/ body shove from an adult or teenager will stop it before it gets 5 ft from the door.  So give them a corner room.  Tell everyone stay out.  And give them 4 10 minute gaps to get the dogs to go out for a walk and come back in. (8 am to leave for a walk.  9 am to bring back.  8pm out and 9pm in).  \n\nNow lake house with a 2 year old.   Yeah you should be pretty damn sober the whole time to watch your daughter anyway.

It could probably be scary to outsiders but they know what they are doing.   Chaos does not make people incompetent.  If they feed, bathe, clean, play, boat, and live in chaos without issue I don\u2019t think adding two pitbulls behind closed doors is too much.  This seems to be their standard operating procedure. \n\nLet\u2019s talk alcohol.  Yea people drink it doesn\u2019t make them lose all responsibility.  And if it does then they shouldn\u2019t be around the children let alone letting \u201cscary bully\u2019s\u201d around them.  Alcohol does not instantly make \u201cthe margin for error high\u201d.   Again all theses people managed to feed, bathe, play and live like this with alcohol just fine.  Adding alcohol seems to be standard operating procedure.

I bet your husband can whip 7 children on a tube behind the boat, while planning a fantasy football league, get teased by his dad all while drinking a beer.  But you might not be able to flow with the chaos like he can.  And since he\u2019s on the boat you\u2019d have to spend lots of attention on the two small creatures you are responsible for.

One of our dogs was a rescue and we were not told about her fear agression when we adopted her. Her fear agression is extreme and she is afraid of EVERYTHING. We have a fully fenced in yard and she is never taken on walks. We called our insurance to make sure there was coverage IF she happened to bite anyone. But we do everything in our power to make sure that never happens. \n\nWhen she goes to the vet, we go at the very last appointment of the day. My husband waits in the car with her until a vet tech indicates it's ok to come in. She goes in through the back employee entrance. She's muzzled before she's even looked at. It's ALWAYS the same vet tech. She loves our dog and always makes sure to be on the schedule. And with the consistency, our dog has become comfortable with her.\n\nWhen we have to board her, she is boarded in a completely seperate building from all the other dogs. She is never put with the other dogs and has to be taken out by herself on walks and a little playtime. The boarder checked to make sure there were at least a few employees she would be ok. If there was only one or two they wouldn't be able to accommodate because she couldn't guarantee they will always be working when she was there. Luckily she gets along with a few. But if there are people she doesn't like, they do not interact with her AT ALL.\n\nIf we have guests staying at our house, she gets boarded. If it's just workmen that are going to be there during the day, she is closed upstairs in a bedroom with me. When the workmen run to pick up a part or take a lunch break my husband takes her on a leash for a walk in the yard to do her business. And we always make sure she is back upstairs secured in the bedroom before they return. \n\nShe is also on medication, we have worked with a trainer and continually consult with our vet. Not all owners of dangerous dogs are complete fuckwits.", "Not necessarily I.e. the boarding. We have a fear agressive dog that is afraid of EVERYTHING and EVERYONE. Still have a great boarder. She insists on an assessment of every dog before she will board them. With ours she also had to make sure there were at least a few employees that could care for her without her trying to eat them. Luckily there were.\n\nSo at the boarder she is kept in a completely seperate building away from all the other dogs. She actually stays in a suite usually used for families that have multiple dogs they want to board together. The boarder has acres of fenced land. The dogs are split into large and small and then spend the majority of the day out running around with multiple staff. Our girl only goes out one on one for walks with staff. They try and get her an individual play session when possible. Only the staff she is cool with ever interact with her. They also make sure there are no other dogs around when she gets picked up or dropped off.\n\nSo it's possible. But you have to put in the work. And it's going to cost you. Boarding our dogs cost almost as much a night as a hotel room for us. We just went on vacation a few weeks ago. We stayed with my parents in their condo, so boarding the dogs cost more than our entire vacation. \n\nWe also have a Pitbull. It's frustrating to me that everyone is afraid of him. He loves everybody. He'll literally stop to smell flowers when on walks. He is submissive to every dog he encounters, including Chihuahuas. But everyone is Leary of him when he's not the one to worry about.", "Great book", "I was just going to say this, you are in charge of your kid\u2019s safety.

If the dog's handler doesn't defend the dog's boundaries (\"no, you can't pet him. No, she doesn't want to meet your kid/puppy/Aunt Mabel\"), the dog will eventually start trying to defend them himself, usually starting with warnings (barking, growling) and escalating if those aren't respected.\n\nSo an aloof dog is more likely to be stressed by a party than a social one, and a stressed dog is more likely to respond poorly to people crowding it.

His behavior was fine at her house for months and also at my house for months (adult son and his other dog moved back in with me during the pandemic) until one day my son was out walking the dogs and a few kids started circling them on bicycles.

I'm very good with dogs, I even have family members who own a business that does training and boarding. I think we'd all balk at such a large dog with that breed mix. When I worked with rescues, we had to triage. We could take on five or more little dogs with issues for every one dog that was over 50 pounds. If we accept a large dog with issues it means that we can't have any little ones for however long it takes to get them up to adoptable standards, so we almost never did. Most rescues I knew operated the same unless they specialized in that breed (I knew one with five acres that did St. Bernards only, for example). So it's usually very much up to the individual owners to choose to take on very large dogs with issues themselves.

You can group all the shepherds, all the guard dogs, etc. and pits will still be at the top of the list. \n\nThere is no place in a modern society for a blood sports dog. And, even if you argue that they\u2019re typically not human aggressive, dog aggression is in most pit type dog breed standards, despite many pit owners refusing to believe it. Why shouldn\u2019t people be upset and nervous or call for stricter regulations against a dog breed that is typically dog aggressive and more likely to hurt or kill their pets? Especially when many pit owners bring their dogs to dog parks, dog friendly stores, dog daycare, etc. and refuse to acknowledge what it was their dogs were bred for until it\u2019s already attacked multiple dogs. The breed should be allowed to peacefully die out, and perhaps allow a select few people breed the dog aggression and prey drive out (which would arguably make them no longer pit bulls) before they\u2019re reintegrated into society. I\u2019d say the same with bulldogs, pugs, German shepherds, or any other breed that has physical or mental deformities that make it difficult for a dog to exist without daily pain.", "While I respect a great deal of what you said.  I counter saying Pit bulls are more represented in reports based on a lumping of multiple breeds, misidentification, greater prevalence and worse outcomes.   If there\u2019s 3000 pit bulls and 20 malls, if 100% of malls bite and 10% of pits bite there\u2019s more pit attacks.    But I\u2019d trust the pit over the malls.   If a corgi bites a child it doesn\u2019t end up in a medical report as it usually does not need medical attention.   Real question Do you have a source that pulls all Shepards, Eskimo, bullies, retrievers etc in lumps?  I have not seen a refutable study that did this.  \n\nSome pits were bred for fighting not all.  Punishing and judging  the entire bred is unfair.  \nAnd historical views of pitbulls show that they were well beyond their early bull baiting type in the early 20th century.   Then dog fights in the later 20th century brought the use of them for fighting in only a small portion.  \n\nPeople should not call for breed specific legislation because it has proved ineffective, which proves pitbulls aren\u2019t the entirety of the problem. \nhttps://www.pitbullinfo.org/breed-specific-legislation.html\n\nBut yes english bulldogs and some pug breading is completely unethical.", "NTA Dogs were banned from my family reunion long before bully breeds became popular.

Evil assholes abused her. The trainer we worked with was 99.9% sure that she had been tortured with a shock collar. She said in her 20 years of experience she had NEVER seen a dog shut down so completely. Until just a few years ago, if you reached toward her head to pet her too quickly or she wasn't expecting it, she would automatically flinch and whimper. Clearly she was hit A LOT. I suspect she may have been kept outside 24/7. Even hard rain scares her and she will go and hide. She also hunts the wildlife in the yard and I've seen her eat the birds she has managed to catch. Regular dog food upsets her stomach so she gets the sensitive stomach kind.\n\nBut I do think she is now happy. Until her arthritis made it so she can't get up in the bed anymore, she loved spooning. Me being the big spoon, her being the \"little\" spoon. Hilarious cause she is almost as long as I am tall. She'd literally sleep with her head resting on my shoulder tucked up under my chin. She's allowed on the couch, our family room is carpeted, she has a dog bed in the kitchen and each bedroom upstairs.\n\nShe loves laying out in the yard or on the deck in the sun. Chasing squirrels. In the winter she likes to lie in front of the fire in the fireplace. We have since gotten a second dog and after a lot of work they are best buds. We joke he's teaching her how to \"dog\". He's taught her how to play and she will even initiate play now. She's much calmer, less afraid and less reactive since we've had him. \n\nEven heavy rain scares the beejeezus out of her. So storms absolutely terrify her (oddly enough she's not bothered by fireworks). Shaking, panting, clawing, trying to dig through the floor, couldn't even go to the bathroom without her coming as well. Since getting our second,now she'll only tremble some. Sometimes she's even completely chill. Now if it storms, she goes to seek him out and be near him. He seems to realize as well because if he's on the couch or a bed he'll get down and go lay down on the floor next to her.\n\nShe rarely is boarded. Mid June we went on vacation, the first time in years. Even pre pandemic she would only be boarded once or twice a year at most. She has her own blankets that go with her. The dog boarder has you bring your own dog food. So she still gets the same food as at home. Now that we have the second dog, they were boarded together in the suite, so she wasn't alone. She has gotten comfortable enough with the vet and vet tech that if they're only doing one thing at the appointment she doesn't need a muzzle.\n\nSo if she's just getting a nail trim, no muzzle. If she's doing annual checkup and vaccinations, no muzzle. If she's doing both (or a different combo of items) the vet likes to have the muzzle just as a precaution. I'm a housewife and I don't drive. In addition I have an autoimmune disease. So I don't leave the house much. So she is rarely ever alone. The last few weeks I've been out and about more than normal for appointments. So she's been left alone once a week for 2-3 hours.\n\nShe LOVES Merrick's Fresh Kisses in the Coconut flavor. That's her top. But she also likes canned pumpkin. And she gets multiple Maro snacks and other dog treats throughout the day everyday. If she turns her nose up at her dog food (she doesn't care for it when it gets to the bottom of the bag) she gets wet food mixed in. And any time she has tummy troubles she gets rice and chicken broth with boiled chicken. Because she has to take pills, she also gets Cheez Whiz at every meal and I usually add a little extra. I could probably go on.\n\nDo I think my dog has the same life/lifestyle as most dogs?? No. Do we have to do work arounds so she feels safe and doesn't react, also protecting other people? Yup.

I wouldn\u2019t even use the breed to make your point - all that matters is they are medium/large sized dogs (capable of causing harm) that will be around children not fully supervised - especially as dogs who have shown any type of dog, stranger, human aggression whatsoever (even the sweetest, least assuming dogs can snap). \n\nIt\u2019s truly unfair to the dogs, to put them in that situation.
