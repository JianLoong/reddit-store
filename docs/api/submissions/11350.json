I am okay around kids, I am engaged when I see my nieces a few times a year, but I generally prefer quiet time and admittedly do not go out of my way to spend time with them. I have a good relationship with my in-laws, and we see each other at holidays etc. But that's about it. It has always been my dream to have a hobby farm of sorts. I have been riding horses since I was a child so since our recent purchase, I now have 2 horses and a few ducks/chickens etc. \n\nSince sharing the news with my in-laws, they have dropped hints to their daughters that I will be having them over and letting them ride my horses and have told me they think it would be a great experience for them to come visit/spend time with us, and get to learn how to ride horses. I am not an equestrian instructor by any means by the way. I have also never suggested that I would be open to having the three of them over during weekends. \n\nI talked to my husband about it and he said it would be a nice thing to do, but I was honest and mentioned I did not want this proposed arrangement to start becoming a regular thing because I know it would. To be honest, my only reasoning is I quite frankly do not want to spend my time having kids around at home with me. I simply do not feel like spending my weekends like that. \n\nI had to confront my in-laws about bringing this up in front of the girls before they even cleared it with me and I have been met with much push back, and I am not acting how family should act, and I am being selfish. His parents are even treating me differently now. His brother and SIL are in their late 30s and are calling me a brat.\n\nThey say it's a small sacrifice for me, and a huge gesture for my nieces but since my early 20s, I have been very comfortable setting strict boundaries in situations that I know for a fact I would not enjoy/be comfortable with. \n\nIt's causing a big rift in the dynamic with my husband's family. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: Thank you for your replies. The property is jointly owned by myself and my husband but the animals/duties are strictly handled by myself. I told him that responsibility was my baby. I am not against having his family over at all, but rather our 3 nieces together without their parents with the expectation they will be riding. Again, not a riding instructor.\n\nEdit 2: have talked it over with husband. He has told me he will absolutely back me up on this decision. He acknowledges they are like my children. He would respect his brother and SIL setting boundaries with their kids, so it's no different with me setting them with mine. Even if it causes some turmoil he is respectful of what I've said to brother/SIL. He is going to try and talk to them.", "created_utc": 1677814642, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gq55i/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_inlaws_to_having_their/", "score": 664, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her husband, a more experienced rider/equine vet, rode one and then the rest were rescues. When their daughter got old enough to ride and wanted to, she got her own horse.\n\nHost them for dinner if you are inclined but don't bend on your boundaries about the horses.

Most people know about pools and swimming nowadays, but not horses.\n\nI suspect that there are horse knowledge elements that most of us don't know about, like having the right sized saddles and other tack for the animals, as well as caring for them and keeping the barn clean.  From what I've read, horses can get very sick from eating the wrong things, too.\n\nPerhaps your inlaws wouldn't be so gung ho about this scheme if they had to be involved in a business like way, OP.  The girls would need to do some barn cleaning, and learn appropriate behavior around horses.\n\nThe parents would need to be right there with the girls, monitoring whether they were being careful around the animals.  I suspect that the parents would need to buy them some special boots or something, too.  I wonder if the youngest child would need her own saddle, too, *to be provided by the parents*.\n\nIt's understandable that you are leery of dealing with 3 excited kids and your horses by yourself.  It might not be so impossible if you let the whole family come occasionally, and *keep the parents involved*.\n\nIf you decide to try this, don't let the parents wander away and not return to the barn.

Mom put the kid on the horse, and then it bolted. 1000% the parents\u2019 fault, but because she didn\u2019t have full insurance to teach off site her farm, they were still able to take her to court. \n\nTL;DR don\u2019t teach backyard lessons unless you\u2019re willing to shell out for insurance, especially with family members who might be entitled dicks and surely would sue if anything went wrong", "INFO:Do the kids have *any* experience with horses at all?\n\nNot that it matters for the judgment, but you can frame it as a safety issue.

Not having them over at all does sound selfish, but I'm with you in not wanting kids around the house more than a few times a year.

Nta.", "They want you to be responsible for three children around two horses that could potentially hurt them if they're not careful? \n\nNta. \n\nThey really didn't think this through. If something bad happens to their children while they'd be in your hypothetical care, they would run you into the ground with legal action. Maybe mention that you're not an instructor and you will not be responsible because it's off the table. \n\nIt speaks volumes on their parenting to expect that from you.", "NTA as someone who has 2 horses, chickens, and a few other farm animals, it's understandable you don't want them all around at once. Part of the reason I got so many animals was because I love having my neices and nephews around but I get why you wouldn't. Horses can be quite dangerous if you aren't familiar with them. You don't have experience teaching how to ride and don't want the risk of the kids getting hurt. They are you animals at the end of the day and if you aren't comfortable with the the kids then it is a safety issue to have them around such large animals.  We have a strict helmet rule when kids want to even just pet our horses or go in the barn.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like these people are making plans for when you and your husband go to your eternal reward, that this house and land would automatically go to their children 'who would have bonded with the property'.  They are clearly already treating it as theirs, making plans without consulting you.\n\nIf your husband, who is their relative doesn't want to be involved in their frequent visits then be say \n\n(1) it doesn't suit either their uncle or his wife\n\n(2) you aren't insured to have them solo on the land, minding the animals.  However if they want to hire somebody qualified to spend time with them and the animals when you're not there, you look forward to seeing evidence of the qualifications and insurance.  \n\n(3) when I don't want somebody to come to my home on the weekend, I tell them jokingly 'Sorry - that's when the orgy is happening'.  You can tell them that the horses don't like children and have a history of biting and kicking children.  when you acquired them, that didn't matter because you had no plan to have children on the land or with the animals.\n\n(4) alternatively you can start making plans in relation to your in laws house.  Call your MIL and tell her when the Brass band and the bouncy castle are to be delivered, that she has to take are of the insurance and that you're written to the local school telling all the children about the party she is hosting on the weekend.  You've contacted the local Pizza place and ordered 50 pies , also to be delivered on that afternoon weekend.  If she objects to this, tell her she is being selfish, not throwing an event to benefit these children!", "NTA! I love that you know what you want and are setting clear boundaries. With all of the societal pressure to have and like children that are put on women, it is great to see you in your power and being unapologetically your true self.", "NTA.  They think they have figured out how to get free riding lessons.  Stand firm!", "NTA purely from a safety standpoint. You are not an instructor. They have no riding experience. If they were to get hurt, which is likely considering both their and your inexperience, you would be liable. Do not let them ride your horses without a professional instructor around!", "Two of my best friends growing up had horses. One of their horses was okay with children. I was taught never to touch a horse without my friend or their parents there because they are animals, and I did not know the ins and outs of anything equestrian besides a saddle. Let alone ride solo. \n\nNta.", "Wait... They want to leave their three young children with someone who doesn't have any experience teaching or controlling kids, around a pair of animals that are well known for being able to cause serious injury by accident ??\n\nNTA in the extreme.", "Not only that an accident with a horse can be extra dangerous. Unless you are confident in teaching someone and have had the proper training that\u2019s a lawsuit waiting to happen. Let me tell you if I had another life it be without kids, as much as I love them I want to experience a life without them also! You are not wrong for not liking kids they are a lot!", "NTA.\n\nAll I saw while reading this was a flashing neon sign about an insurance claim if one of those girls got hurt. It's another thing to allow them over to OBSERVE the animals.\n\nI set boundaries with my home too. I don't really let anyone except my MIL/FIL, my parents, my sister, and one set of neighbors over. I don't even allow my BIL/his girlfriend over. My home is my family's safe place and where I go to get away from everybody/everything. I don't feel like hosting all of the time.", "NTA.  I shudder to think about someone who is not a riding instructor teaching three children to ride (at the same time!).  The possible negative outcomes are serious - even having one's foot stepped on by a horse is painful.  Not to mention that since they're ignoring you about teaching the children, they may also ignore you about safety things like riding helmets.  This is just too dangerous.  \n\nYou say that your husband's family is not accepting your decision.  They don't have to accept it - it is what it is.  You've made the decision, period.  There's nothing left to discuss.  They'll have to get over it.", "NTA, horseback riding can be dangerous if not done properly, your nieces need lessons from a proper instructor and your inlaws are probably just trying to weasel out of having to pay for it", "NTA\u2026but your husband is.  He should not be backing you up, he should be the one setting the boundaries with his family, not you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso kids riding on your horses will ruin their training.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: your inlaws are AHs.", "NTA they are volunteering your services and your animals without discussing it with you first, that's not on,  honestly in your situation if you wanted to develop this into a more tenable situation I would say they have to have at least  10 (or however many you feel they would need for your horses) lessons with a professional  instructor, they have to learn to groom tack and care for the horses and help you clean out the stables and learn about and make friends with the horses before they can ride with you.  You will only take them one at a time so the person helping with the horses gets to ride and only one per day.  If they are willing to learn to care for the horses and help care for them showing commitment then it could be a way of really connecting also let's face it the kids who really want to ride will do it, if not the kids will solve the issue for you.", "Have you and your husband made plans for your older years? Is he hoping for Xmas invitations from nieces/nephews or for someone to act as PoA when he/you are no longer capable?\n\nI think it's totally legitimate for you to not want to spend your time the way your in-laws are demanding, and even to not want much of a relationship with the kids, but it doesn't 100% sound as tho you and husband are on the same page. You tend to get out of relationships what you put into them, are you sure neither of you ever wants to get anything out of these relationships?", "NTA\n\nBut if you're willing (and only then) you could always suggest they girls help you out around the farm and with caring for the horses. That way they get horse time (petting and loving on them), and maybe learn horse safety - and you may get some help with chores.", "NTA.\n\nYour not being the asshole will not mean that any of this will turn out well though. Those kids are going to be showing up, probably with their parents silent background encouragement. The parents tried to force you to agree to it by mentioning it to you in front of their kids, now they will just tell their kids to go over anyway.\n\nThe line you need to draw is against them coming over at all, with parents or not. If you do not draw the line there, the kids are going to come over and ride your horses whenever they want, whether you are there or not. Those kinds of parents raise those kinds of kids.\n\nIf your husband does not agree with your hard line on them simply not being welcome at any time, with parents or not, then you need to get a lawyer with real experience in liability cases to have a sit down with your husband about what it is like to lose everything you own because kids hurt themselves doing something that they had occasional permission to do.\n\nThe line needs to be kids not welcome at any time, because a smart lawyer can easily make occasional permission into permission, period. If you have a hard line \"kids never allowed\" then the only time they could be there is when they were already trespassing to get there.\n\nHorses can disable people permanently, and even kill. It is, in terms of real danger, about the same as having open pits for car repair, except people are really not smart about horses and giant pits in the ground make people scared.", "NTA on being voluntold to be a babysitter/instructor. \n\nBut did you really think that buying property near your in-laws wasn\u2019t going to include more interaction with said in-laws? And to start farming/animal keeping wasn\u2019t going to involve nearby family interest? You should have been talking about this with your husband while looking to buy the land.", "NTA\nIf they turn up (and I feel like they might), may I suggest you get the kids started on the basics of looking after animals.... cleaning up the shit! The more shit the better, doesn't even matter of they are shovelling it from one place tp another. You can tell them it's a year of the shot course, then a year of cleaning and maintaining the equipment, the  the parents must pay for a year, two lessons a week of riding, before you will even consider letting them actually touch the animals. How entitled of the entire family. And you can bet if something happened to the girls, the blame would firmly be landed at your feet.", "Lol, tell them you\u2019re sending the horses to THEIR HOUSE for the weekend and see how they react.\n\nNTA at all", "NTA got here after your edits. So glad your husband is backing you up. As a child I hated spending too much time with adult family members who didn\u2019t like kids, as a child you can totally tell. It would be misery all around. Some people are so entitled and they will never get it, hope you stand your ground and good luck!", "One word:  liability.  \n\nYou decide if and when you want to invite guests to your home or to ride your horses. \nDefinitely NTA. \n\nOn the flip side, getting them to clean up after the horses could be helpful. Lol", "No, you\u2019re totally looking at this the wrong way! Have them sign a contract stating you are not liable if they get hurt, and also that nieces agree they have to contribute two hours of stable and grounds work for every half hour of riding time they get. Three of them? You\u2019ll never have to muck out a stall again\u2026  /s\n\nNTA -**OP; PLEASE GET CAMERAS!** They are teenagers- what are the chances they or their friends decide to just pay a midnight visit and go for a ride?", "NTA - Forget that you simply don't want to babysit kids that aren't yours. Taking youg children onto a farm and letting them ride large animal is a huge financial liability. What would happen if a horse spooks and one of the kids is accidentally injured? Especially if you're talking about the parents not being there, you very likely would be blamed with the accusations that you could have done something differently to prevent it.", "NTA but you sound like a joy to have as an aunt. You live nearby to family and you don't want to hang out with them. You sound like someone who is not willing to make an compromise, how about no riding but seeing the animals. Your house your rules but dont be shocked if the family doesn't want anything to do with you.", "Seriously.  I am somewhat like the OP - would love to have a nice please to enjoy peace and quiet....having to take care of three kids would just spoil it.  Would that make me selfish? Oh well....\n\nNTA", "The in laws are ah for feeling entitled to tell the kids they will be able to come to op s house to ride the horses. NTA op.", "Thank you. There are lots of comments that I should still allow them to come visit on weekends and have them do basic tasks instead of riding as a compromise, but that does absolutely not feel like a compromise to me seeing as though we have a good relationship (or had, I guess now) for the two times a year we saw BIL/SIL. It feels extremely one-sided.", "I've accepted that. As mentioned above, we don't have a close relationship. His parents have always been polite but have resented me for not giving them grandkids. Brother/sister on law do not have us over, we see each other at most twice a year at husband's parents' place. Now since I have something that interests them, all of a sudden prior to me confronting them they were all sweet as pie when assuming I would have the girls over. My husband has decided to back my decision. I am really ok with not being close with them if they act so entitled. Allowing this is a completely one-sided arrangement.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" but they are not accepting my decision.\" ... So refuse to discuss it, and when your in laws don't stop leave or end the call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet your husband visit them alone.", "Also horses and riding are inherently dangerous and having others there in that capacity would greatly increase your liability and risk.  Nta.", "Good for you OP, that\u2019s amazing!\n\nCan we get some horsie tax tho please!! \nAnd maybe an update with how this goes! I really hope it works out for you!", "Everyone is right that you're not an AH, but if you want to keep things even keeled with the in-laws, diplomacy might be a good idea. You can be right, and still blow things up.\n\nFocus on the insurance, training, etc part. That you're not licensed or insured for riding instruction. You have no experience doing so. And it'd be very expensive to that that training, insurance, etc. If anything happened, you would not be trained to handle it and the financial consequences would be stiff. \n\nIf you want to be extra diplomatic, you can say you're exploring options. But pressuring you to do the equivalent of letting teens driving an unregistered car without a driving license or even permit will not be appreciated.", "Which is also an important point. You\u2019re not qualified to really teach them or help them to ride safely. How would the in-laws react if one of the girls fell? This could be a huge liability.\nNTA.", "You don't owe your SIL free babysitting on your farm. Changing the planned activity doesn't change the situation at all.   \nAnd I don't understand how a parent could think it is healthy to force her kids on someone who doesn't want to babysit them. I wouldn't do that to my children.", "If you don't see them much that's even more of a reason why you could spend one afternoon showing them the horses since you know they wont start coming to your house every other day. \n\nNot letting them ride is ok, but for kids seeing horses and touching or feeding them is already something special and you depriving then of such a possibility is an ah moove. \n\nApart from that, yeah, they should've asked you first, but blocking any chance of them ever coming over is not right. You're family and it's not wrong to think that you'd be ok with letting them come over to your house and see the horses.", "I agree.  Sounds like (from another comment) that the nieces were never interested in spending time with their aunt until she got the horses.  So how again is she the bad guy?", "Thank you. That's the thing, I don't really have the time/want to spend the time doing this as a nice gesture for each one. They never have us over and his family has always been standoffish to me because I don't want kids of my own.", "I don't think they were in the US", "To be honest in Florida they have no liability. This might not be as big of a deal as you think because that same law is present in many other states. \n\nSimply put a horse owner is not responsible in any way, shape or form for any injuries that horse may cause while in normal use. Like if I dump him in a mall, my fault. On my property and a girl gets dumped? Not even close to my problem. \n\n\u201cFlorida's equine liability statute provides that an equine activity sponsor, an equine professional, or any other person shall not be liable for an injury to, or the death of, a participant resulting from the inherent risks of equine activities. F. S. A. \u00a7 773.01-02.\u201d", "And the parents be there the whole time to supervise on top of it otherwise it's a no go. NTA", "Except she has NO INTEREST in teaching anyone to ride", "And at least one parent of the girls is always present so you don't have to babysit.", "Fair enough :)", "\"if he thought about the liability.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nor if HE did the work of preparing everything, taking them to ride and look after them and clean up after them.", "And insist if you ever accept to let them come over that at least one parent comes and stay the whole time with the kids.otherwise you will become the babysitter by default. NTA", "The person you responded to literally says that OP should teach them those responsibilities and then once they did, they could then learn to ride.  This is why literally no part of that \"idea\" is good.  Because ANY WAY op gets involved will be used to try to pressure her into letting the nieces be involved with the horses.", "Again, I said that is a good way for the girls to learn but it is not the OP's responsibility to do it.\n\nThe teaching technique is right, but as I said, it is not on the OP to teach them or offer her horses up to do it.", "The stuff being described in the \"excellent idea\" here is just basic \"Horses 101\".  They're going to learn that stuff whether they take beginning riding lessons at a stable or going to OP's home and learning from her.  \n\nThe \"excellent idea\" doesn't work because, even if the nieces go and learn horses somewhere else, well, now what's the excuse for them not being able to come out and spend time with OP and her horses since they now \"officially\" have training?\n\nThe entire point here is that OP doesn't want to participate in \"forced family fun\" and be responsible for nieces being a perpetual presence.  I suspect in-laws, in part, want OP involved because that means they don't have to pay for riding lessons for their kids, because hey...why not, OP can just casually work with them!  OP even mentions in the comments that in-laws were never really interested in a relationship until now...regarding the horses.\n\nI'm not saying nieces shouldn't go be involved with horses if they're ACTUALLY interested, but the whole point here is that OP really just doesn't want to play host to this, and it SOUNDS like an interest based on convenience of OP."]}
