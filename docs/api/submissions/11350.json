I am okay around kids, I am engaged when I see my nieces a few times a year, but I generally prefer quiet time and admittedly do not go out of my way to spend time with them. I have a good relationship with my in-laws, and we see each other at holidays etc. But that's about it. It has always been my dream to have a hobby farm of sorts. I have been riding horses since I was a child so since our recent purchase, I now have 2 horses and a few ducks/chickens etc. \n\nSince sharing the news with my in-laws, they have dropped hints to their daughters that I will be having them over and letting them ride my horses and have told me they think it would be a great experience for them to come visit/spend time with us, and get to learn how to ride horses. I am not an equestrian instructor by any means by the way. I have also never suggested that I would be open to having the three of them over during weekends. \n\nI talked to my husband about it and he said it would be a nice thing to do, but I was honest and mentioned I did not want this proposed arrangement to start becoming a regular thing because I know it would. To be honest, my only reasoning is I quite frankly do not want to spend my time having kids around at home with me. I simply do not feel like spending my weekends like that. \n\nI had to confront my in-laws about bringing this up in front of the girls before they even cleared it with me and I have been met with much push back, and I am not acting how family should act, and I am being selfish. His parents are even treating me differently now. His brother and SIL are in their late 30s and are calling me a brat.\n\nThey say it's a small sacrifice for me, and a huge gesture for my nieces but since my early 20s, I have been very comfortable setting strict boundaries in situations that I know for a fact I would not enjoy/be comfortable with. \n\nIt's causing a big rift in the dynamic with my husband's family. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: Thank you for your replies. The property is jointly owned by myself and my husband but the animals/duties are strictly handled by myself. I told him that responsibility was my baby. I am not against having his family over at all, but rather our 3 nieces together without their parents with the expectation they will be riding. Again, not a riding instructor.\n\nEdit 2: have talked it over with husband. He has told me he will absolutely back me up on this decision. He acknowledges they are like my children. He would respect his brother and SIL setting boundaries with their kids, so it's no different with me setting them with mine. Even if it causes some turmoil he is respectful of what I've said to brother/SIL. He is going to try and talk to them.", "created_utc": 1677814642, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gq55i/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_inlaws_to_having_their/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have no idea how people can think they can just hop on whatever horse with no experience and its fine. My cousin is a vet and kept horses my entire childhood and exactly zero of them were suitable for any child to ride. Of her horses - up to 6 - she only rode 2. Her husband, a more experienced rider/equine vet, rode one and then the rest were rescues. When their daughter got old enough to ride and wanted to, she got her own horse.\n\nHost them for dinner if you are inclined but don't bend on your boundaries about the horses.

Your hobby farm does not necessarily mean you are running a dude ranch for relatives. \n\nI suspect the same family members who think they can nominate you and your property for this also have no intention of doing any of the actual work involved, or paying any expenses.

It was rude and entitled to just assume anyone be ok with this arrangement. When they come over I would not let them ride. One wrong move could injury your horses.

I suspect that they want to drop the kids off for some fun, while they go about their business.  \n\nWhile pools can be dangerous, so are horses.  Most people know about pools and swimming nowadays, but not horses.\n\nI suspect that there are horse knowledge elements that most of us don't know about, like having the right sized saddles and other tack for the animals, as well as caring for them and keeping the barn clean.  From what I've read, horses can get very sick from eating the wrong things, too.\n\nPerhaps your inlaws wouldn't be so gung ho about this scheme if they had to be involved in a business like way, OP.  The girls would need to do some barn cleaning, and learn appropriate behavior around horses.\n\nThe parents would need to be right there with the girls, monitoring whether they were being careful around the animals.  I suspect that the parents would need to buy them some special boots or something, too.  I wonder if the youngest child would need her own saddle, too, *to be provided by the parents*.\n\nIt's understandable that you are leery of dealing with 3 excited kids and your horses by yourself.  It might not be so impossible if you let the whole family come occasionally, and *keep the parents involved*.\n\nIf you decide to try this, don't let the parents wander away and not return to the barn.

Kid got on, horse IMMEDIATELY bolted, kid\u2019s foot went through the stirrup because it was too large for the child, he got dragged around by the horse and died because his helmet (bought and put on by his parents) was not adjusted properly and came off. This all happened within minutes of the instructor showing up; she did not know or inspect the horse or the kid\u2019s safety gear. Mom put the kid on the horse, and then it bolted. 1000% the parents\u2019 fault, but because she didn\u2019t have full insurance to teach off site her farm, they were still able to take her to court. \n\nTL;DR don\u2019t teach backyard lessons unless you\u2019re willing to shell out for insurance, especially with family members who might be entitled dicks and surely would sue if anything went wrong", "INFO:Do the kids have *any* experience with horses at all?\n\nNot that it matters for the judgment, but you can frame it as a safety issue. As well you know, a horse is a thousand pound, skittish animal. Their bite pressure is twice that of a pitbull's, and they can launch the iron-clad rocks they call feet at 200 mph and 2000 psi. \n\nOn top of that, I'm positive your horses are not trained to be teaching horses. That means they may react badly to the kids' novice mistakes.\n\nShow them pictures of horse bite marks. Say even if they're 100% sure that the kids will respond to every command immediately, neither you nor your horses have the proper training to be their introduction to riding.", "I would make it very clear that the horses you keep aren't meant to be instructional horses for novice riders nor are you willing or qualified to provide any riding instruction. My horse riding friends shut this shit down quickly when people get the wrong impression that you can put any person on any horse regardless of experience or temperament and be good. Just like potential service dogs start as puppies and through training, sometimes they're not meant to be seeing eye dogs. Some horses aren't meant for inexperienced riders and even if yours are, for this request, they're *NOT*.", "That is a perfectly reasonable issue actually. \n\nPersonally I love kids, and were we younger and had the means I most certainly would love a hobby farm and horses (grew up enjoying working farm life and working horses in fact). \n\nBut becoming a casual riding instructor on a regular basis would not be happening. If family who knew how to ride and knew how to work wanted to come and do both, great lol.\n\nAt the very least the parents should be there and pitching in. But it sounds like nobody in his family is farm knowledgeable.", "I have multiple children. My niece TEACHES horseback and I can\u2019t imagine expecting her just to \u201clet my kids come over and ride.\u201d You are not a teacher and you have been clear about your expectations. Totally NTA. Plus, in some jurisdictions, you would be the one with the liability if they got hurt. (My mom\u2019s best friend broke her foot at my mom\u2019s house and her health insurance filed a claim against my mom\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance to cover her medical bills).", "Thank you for the clarification. Nta in that respect.", "When you do host make sure they know they will not be riding or you will have a major meltdown on your hands. Be very clear the horses will be locked away in the burn", "So in other words they want free babysitting/riding lessons... NTA. Injury liability if the worst case scenario happens would be a nightmare.", "Ok, got it. I don't know why anybody would want their child to be taught how to ride horses by somebody who is uncomfortable teaching how to ride horses. That sounds like it wouldn't be safe", "You might like to cook and host, but it seems clear the takeaway message was not \u201cI love having you all over, but I\u2019m not comfortable with teaching horseback riding.\u201d There\u2019s a human element to this which you can\u2019t just ignore.", "Thank you. I added an edit, but I am not against having his family over. I love to cook and host so that's not an issue. It's more an issue with having the 3 kids over with the expectation that they will be riding my horses on the weekends without their parents, and not a dinner or what not. The animals/duties are solely mine, not my husband's although the property is joint.", "I didn\u2019t really see anything in OP\u2019s post that suggested that the nieces would be there for the entirety of the weekend - I assumed something more like a few hours. OP said she had been comfortable with setting boundaries in the past so I guess I\u2019m not seeing why setting a boundary for this particular situation would be any different. The girls couldn\u2019t come over once every 2 months even, to learn about horses for a few hours? It just seems a bit ridiculous to me.", "Seems like the simple answer is to tell your nieces you are not going to teach them but they should ask their parents to find a horse riding barn to take lessons. But they are welcome to visit with their parents & then invite everyone over for dinner. Put it back on their parents. No one is entitled to your stuff but you have exciting stuff & the cat is out of the bag already. So just tell them your horses are not for riding & you\u2019re busy on the weekends.", "[deleted]", "I didn\u2019t say your in-laws and nieces are entitled to anything. What I am saying is that by moving closer, the normal expectation is that you would want to interact with your in-laws more. You don\u2019t move closer to someone and expect to see them less.", "I\u2019ll move near you but don\u2019t want to see you nor spend time with you. There\u2019s an incongruence between the action and the message whether intentional or not.", "Yep, betting OP\u2019s husband would be rethinking what a nice gesture it would be if he thought about the liability.", "Well thats a horrifying story. That poor child.", "Thank you! I will for sure.", "To add. His brother and SIL never have us over. We meet at his parents' place. They have mentioned us having our nieces over for overnights.", "That's ok. They never have us over. We only meet at husband's parents' place. It would be a very one sided arrangement.", "They had mentioned us taking them for overnights. It's ok if it sounds ridiculous, but at the end of the day they are my animals and responsibility. Once every 2 months is still too much for me considering we see each other once/twice a year, and at his parents house.  Husband's brother/SIL never have us over.", "I've been riding for 23 years and teaching riding lessons for 10 years. It definitely isn't ridiculous to set a boundary of not having the nieces over to learn about or ride the horses if OP isn't interested in, or comfortable with, doing so. \n\nI can see how someone who isn't a \"horse person\" would think it's no big deal and a bit ridiculous to not allow that, but ultimately, horses are incredibly expensive, require lots of work and knowledge to care for, and are a liability to have inexperienced people interacting with. Especially if the owner isn't comfortable instructing. There's a huge, huge difference between doing something yourself and teaching someone else how to do it.  \n\nEven as an actual elementary school teacher and a riding instructor, I definitely am not interested in having my free time voluntold to bring family/friends over to ride or interact with my horses. If I *want* to do that with someone, I will offer. If someone who is interested in the horses happens to be at my house, I'll maybe offer to take them with me to feed or pet the horses, but it's a quick 10-15 minute visit and then they're out of my barn.", "Yes, I think this is best. Also as mentioned above. BIL and SIL never have us over. We only meet at husband's parents' place. I will still have them over to be nice, but I do not want this to be a regular thing with the girls coming over without their folks. And my horses are not \"stuff\", they are my responsibility and pride and joy. They are not toys meant for the entertainment of the kids.", "I added an edit, but I am not against having his family over. I love to cook and host so that's not an issue. It's more an issue with having the 3 kids over with the expectation that they will be riding my horses on the weekends without their parents, and not a dinner or what not. The animals/duties are solely mine, not my husband's although the property is joint.", "Horses spook easily, and kick. Those hooves can do a LOT of damage and break bones.", "My, it seems they are looking for all kinds of free child care lol. They sound like lovely people. \n\nI hope your hubby backs you up on this,because I can totally see your house becoming a summer camp as well.", "It\u2019s amazing how popular you get and how loved you are when you have something someone else\u2019s wants. Especially family. They can ignore you until magically you have something they want then your the best thing since sliced bread.\n\nI have no judgment. I am currently keeping my pool under wraps. I don\u2019t want to babysit. I didn\u2019t buy the pool for anyone but me. I know when family finds out they will want to drop thier kids off, but that ain\u2019t going to happen. I plan on sitting in the pool and day drinking. My kids are grown and I have no desire to be child care.\n\nBut low key I am so jealous right now. I love horses. Just don\u2019t have one because we don\u2019t have the room.", "This is my favorite response so far thank you so much!!", "Since you don\u2019t have much contact maybe the girls will just forget. As for the adults you should say exactly what you just said... because you\u2019re 100% right. Horses are not toys. You wouldn\u2019t hand the keys to your car to your nieces because it\u2019s not safe for them. You\u2019re not interested nor do you have the time to run an equestrian school so kids don\u2019t get to access to your horses. Period. If they want their kids to learn how to ride, then they can find a barn that gives lessons.", "First read through I got a no kids vibe so apologies. But if it\u2019s just no horse riding I think that\u2019s perfectly reasonable. If they girls are responsible and are gentle would they be able to interact with the horses with you?", "Totally it's less about learning to ride a horse and more about free babysitting. But if u pitch it to the children as horses then they wanna go over there even more often. This gives the parents an excuse to jump dump them there all the time.", "I completely feel you on this and you're NTA! Can't believe I forgot to vote in my first comment lol. \n\nIf you do end up hosting your in-laws at some point, I'd suggest taking the girls with you to feed the horses, spend a few minutes petting them, and/or (at most) hand them a soft brush and let them groom for a couple of minutes if you want. \n\nMost people are happy with that level of interaction and realize they're more intimidating animals than they thought when it's time to try to feed them a treat or groom them. \n\nAlso, congratulations on your farm and the horses! And the chickens and ducks :) That's so exciting and I'm happy for you to have your dream hobby farm!", "Those are where my thoughts are going too lol. I mean it would be different if these folks also hosted regularly at their house or something. But it sounds like a pretty lopsided relationship. \n\nI am not a fan of purely transactional relationships but it isn't right when one family member of a few do all the hosting and then get volunteered to do more.", "My family and my SO family r notorious for volun-told. Try to take to the spouse/SO/parent about what they want u to do for them so they get that person to inform, not ask, inform or even demand that u go do this, cuz they already said u would. First few years we were together I can't count how many of them got upset, cuz neither of us would do that. Nor would we call each other and say this person is looking for u. That same person had already called and left a message, just wasn't happy they didn't get a call back immediately. It's all the same principle. Transactional. Some still talk to us, some don't, neither of us truly miss the ones who don't. Sire we still see them often, we just don't say much to each other.", "I dumped my entire family decades ago after my grandmother died. They were very annoying by and large. \n\nHubby has an adult son like this, the only time you hear from him is when he needs money.", "I'm pretty sure if u have more than 5 relative it's a guarantee there's one of those. Lol"]}
