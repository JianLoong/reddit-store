{"id": 11350, "submission_id": "11gq55i", "title": "AITA for saying no to my in-laws to having their kids over?", "selftext": "Long story short, I (31F) and my husband (43M) recently bought a rural property within a short-ish driving distance from his parents and both of his siblings, one who has 3 kids (14F), (12F) and (8F). \n\nI have known I do not want children for the longest time. I am okay around kids, I am engaged when I see my nieces a few times a year, but I generally prefer quiet time and admittedly do not go out of my way to spend time with them. I have a good relationship with my in-laws, and we see each other at holidays etc. But that's about it. It has always been my dream to have a hobby farm of sorts. I have been riding horses since I was a child so since our recent purchase, I now have 2 horses and a few ducks/chickens etc. \n\nSince sharing the news with my in-laws, they have dropped hints to their daughters that I will be having them over and letting them ride my horses and have told me they think it would be a great experience for them to come visit/spend time with us, and get to learn how to ride horses. I am not an equestrian instructor by any means by the way. I have also never suggested that I would be open to having the three of them over during weekends. \n\nI talked to my husband about it and he said it would be a nice thing to do, but I was honest and mentioned I did not want this proposed arrangement to start becoming a regular thing because I know it would. To be honest, my only reasoning is I quite frankly do not want to spend my time having kids around at home with me. I simply do not feel like spending my weekends like that. \n\nI had to confront my in-laws about bringing this up in front of the girls before they even cleared it with me and I have been met with much push back, and I am not acting how family should act, and I am being selfish. His parents are even treating me differently now. His brother and SIL are in their late 30s and are calling me a brat.\n\nThey say it's a small sacrifice for me, and a huge gesture for my nieces but since my early 20s, I have been very comfortable setting strict boundaries in situations that I know for a fact I would not enjoy/be comfortable with. \n\nIt's causing a big rift in the dynamic with my husband's family. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: Thank you for your replies. The property is jointly owned by myself and my husband but the animals/duties are strictly handled by myself. I told him that responsibility was my baby. I am not against having his family over at all, but rather our 3 nieces together without their parents with the expectation they will be riding. Again, not a riding instructor.\n\nEdit 2: have talked it over with husband. He has told me he will absolutely back me up on this decision. He acknowledges they are like my children. He would respect his brother and SIL setting boundaries with their kids, so it's no different with me setting them with mine. Even if it causes some turmoil he is respectful of what I've said to brother/SIL. He is going to try and talk to them.\n\nFinal Edit: Have talked with husband again and we are going to really emphasize the insurance/liability aspect as the main reason I will not be allowing my nieces to ride my horses. We are going to have everyone over to see our home and I will allow them to meet the horses completely supervised. I would like to clarify that my in-laws and my husband have 0 knowledge of keeping horses and my husband did not realize how much was involved and how much more work it would be for me to allow this. They seemed to make a blind assumption based on their own feelings, not taking into consideration myself or my horses. I can see a lot of people made suggestions about having my nieces over regularly to clean tack, muck stalls, groom, if not riding. But I have made a final decision that I would prefer not to spend the time doing that. Our weekends are for my husband and I. We built our life around not needing to incorporate children, and beyond the one or two times we see our nieces, that's ok with him. Husband completely agrees and if his in-laws can't understand this, then that's too bad for them. As my animals, he says he should not have a say in what the final decision is, even if people end up upset. He said that I come first to him in our relationship.

They\u2019re all great horses as I\u2019m sure yours are too, but mine would all hit the roof if a little kid sitting on them got scared and shrieked bloody murder. If kicked too hard, my personal horse would bury that child face first into the ground and murder the kid out of spite for scaring him. \n\nIf nothing else, a lack of adequate liability insurance alone should stop you from doing this. I pay almost $10k a year for insurance so if, heaven forbid, a kid has an incidental fall and dies in a lesson or something (because just sitting on a horse that\u2019s not moving can become a fatal situation in a millisecond) I can\u2019t be sued out of house and home. A friend of mine had to testify as a witness in a case where roughly that happened; a little kid died in a lesson as a result of negligence not on the instructor\u2019s part, but the parents\u2019. The parents were still trying to sue the instructor even though they put the kid on a non-beginner horse with ill-fitting tack and safety gear, then lied to the instructor to get her to come teach an on site lesson. Kid got on, horse IMMEDIATELY bolted, kid\u2019s foot went through the stirrup because it was too large for the child, he got dragged around by the horse and died because his helmet (bought and put on by his parents) was not adjusted properly and came off. This all happened within minutes of the instructor showing up; she did not know or inspect the horse or the kid\u2019s safety gear. Mom put the kid on the horse, and then it bolted. 1000% the parents\u2019 fault, but because she didn\u2019t have full insurance to teach off site her farm, they were still able to take her to court. \n\nTL;DR don\u2019t teach backyard lessons unless you\u2019re willing to shell out for insurance, especially with family members who might be entitled dicks and surely would sue if anything went wrong", "INFO:Do the kids have *any* experience with horses at all?\n\nNot that it matters for the judgment, but you can frame it as a safety issue.

There's a huge, huge difference between doing something yourself and teaching someone else how to do it.  \n\nEven as an actual elementary school teacher and a riding instructor, I definitely am not interested in having my free time voluntold to bring family/friends over to ride or interact with my horses.

Not having them over at all does sound selfish, but I'm with you in not wanting kids around the house more than a few times a year.

The children need proper instruction so you would rather they learn from experts if they really want to learn.\n\nIn any case, please put up cameras to prevent any 'accidental' rides.

I also agree with the feedback that while you\u2019re not an AH you might find that things get easier for you if you handle it diplomatically. Some things to point out:\n\n- Horses need to have the right training and temperament to carry beginners. Perhaps your horses have behavior issues or are too high energy and are unsafe for beginners? Wink, wink. \n- Typically you would need a fenced in training area to give lessons in. Do you have a suitable area? I would not feel safe taking a first time or very beginner rider on a trail ride. There are certainly companies that do that, but they have slow, calm horses that are trained to walk a specific trail while carrying inexperienced riders. That\u2019s not your situation. \n- You could redirect them by giving them information about riding instructors in the area and telling them that they should totally sign the kids up for lessons and once the kids have done enough lessons to be skilled riders then they could come over and ride with you. This one is a bit dicey, but I\u2019m giving it a 99% chance that they never follow through. Doing this allows you to frame things more positively as \u201cRiding is so great!

As someone who used to dream of being a riding instructor/horse trainer, it is way too much personal liability to do it in the situation described. I gave up that dream once I realized the burden it would be to obtain proper insurance, obtain or train suitable lesson horses, and then manage all of the business responsibilities and liability, and rent or buy a suitable place to do it and carry insurance for that facility. And that\u2019s for someone who wanted to do all that as a career, let alone someone who doesn\u2019t. \n\nI would explain to them that these are not lesson horses, not beginner suitable (I\u2019m assuming a little there based on OP\u2019s confidence in even keeping horses without having an instructor), and you are not a riding instructor and therefore not insured, nor is your property insured as an equine business. Maybe give them some resources on places near them that are suitable for them to learn on suitable lesson horses.\n\nIF your horses would be suitable for a beginner rider, and IF you would be comfortable with them riding them if they had more experience or were under the supervision of a trainer, and IF you have an arena of some sort, another compromise could be to find an instructor that you are comfortable with to travel to your location that carries their own equine business insurance that would cover wherever they travel, or that the in-laws pay for the proper insurance for the property, furnish the kids with their own boots, helmet, and appropriate riding clothes, and purchase appropriate tack to fit the kids and your horses. Either they can pay a real instructor a lesson fee per kid, their travel fees, the cost of buying the necessary equipment for the comfort and safety of the horses and their kids, and the associated insurance costs or they cannot ride the horses, period. I\u2019m guessing even if this would be acceptable to you, they\u2019ll turn up their nose at the costs and (maybe) realize how much they\u2019re really asking you to do for free. But my guess is if presented with that option versus going to an instructor you suggest who presumably can provide horses, lessons, and equipment at their own facility, they\u2019ll either go the cheaper way and go to an instructors facility to learn without the extra costs or forgo the idea completely because it sounds like something the kids only want because it\u2019s being presented by parents who see it as a free way to occupy their kids and not because it\u2019s something the kids would like to legitimately pursue.
