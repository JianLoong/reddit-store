I'm anxiously attached and my boyfriend's an avoidant. I'm also a highly sensitive individual and have been trying to work on it but I think I can sometimes be ridiculous. Early on in our relationship I found texts between my boyfriend and his brother about how I was stupid. Now, all of us work in tech and I make more money than both of them and I do think they're smarter than me but I think they're not as great at navigating social dynamics at work. This happened 9 years ago, I got really upset and he got really upset cause I went through his phone. I haven't gone through his phone since but I always wonder if they still talk shit about me. Just a weird intuition. His brother recently started dating and falls in love with a lot of people and my boyfriend mentions to me excitedly that his brothers dating someone that raises chickens or is running a start up etc. Idk if this is narcissistic of me but I just really wish he was as excited about me and spoke about me as positively as he speaks of these other women. I didn't bring this up to him right away and I was trying to just self soothe and tell myself I was being ridiculous but I also don't hide emotions well. He kept asking me about what was wrong and I insisted it was nothing to do with him, I am wrong in my thinking about something and I'm trying to work through it. Ultimately I caved and asked him if he didn't respect me bc he didn't respect what I did and if he's ever wanted to date someone with a different background. I think maybe he's annoyed with how much he has to reassure me a out things but he just went \"ugh\" and did say no but the \"ugh\" really hurt and I'm having a hard time understanding why someone who'd want to be with you would express \"ugh\" when you're already pretty insecure and being vulnerable. \n\nAita for being upset and wanting an unprompted apology?", "created_utc": 1704173808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18whspl/aita_for_feeling_insecure_when_my_bf_talks/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've never felt anywhere near as insecure and uncertain in a relationship since.\n\nSo you work in tech - a notoriously male dominated industry...yet you're making more than they are...and you think you're not as smart?  Being able to successfully navigate social dynamics at work is a skill in itself and I'm sure you're good at your job, too. You're diminishing yourself so your partner doesn't get jealous. That's just shit.\n\nIf he wants a girlfriend who raises chickens, let him go and find one! Plenty of men would be more than impressed with what you do, believe me. \n\nAlso - talk to a therapist and build yourself back up so you're eventually confident enough to know your own worth.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We are all insecure sometimes but you seem proud of the label \"anxious attachment\" or at least not in a hurry to shed it and...it's not cute. It was unkind of him to make that noise. He frankly sounds like a jerk and I'm not sure why you're with someone who treats you like this. And I'd trust my instincts if you think something is off. He sounds mean. But also if he's frustrated after ten years of you being a basket case omg I was frustrated reading this. You are an adult and it's up to you to take responsibility and pull yourself together."]}
