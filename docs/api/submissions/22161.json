A \u201cfight\u201d should be sharing you perspective, feelings, or thoughts on a problem and listening to you partner do the same. Yes things can get heated and emotional, but it is about the problem NOT hurting your partner.

While you are trying to solve the problem of him creating moldy towels and not keeping his side of the chore bargain. He is not someone who loves you in a healthy mature way. \n\nThird, he is massively lacking in self awareness. Lacking so much, the difference in your maturity levels and self awareness is incompatible. How does he function in everyday life if he can\u2019t perform basic life tasks he already agreed to?
