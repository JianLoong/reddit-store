I work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, with a 4 hour commute.\n\nIn the past few months, we\u2019ve argued twice about him not cleaning up after himself. The particular sore spots are him not hanging up his bath towel after drying off, which causes it to get moldy and smelly, along with him leaving his clothes all over the ground. He knows this causes me a huge amount of stress and anxiety, and I refuse to do it for him because he is an adult.\n\nIn the beginning, I\u2019d ask him every single day, nicely and politely, to put his clothes in the hamper and hang his bath towel up. This would continue for several days straight, and I\u2019d get frustrated and escalate the issue, pointing out that I shouldn\u2019t have to ask him to do this every single day. In response, he\u2019d get mad, threaten to leave \u201csince he\u2019s such a horrible boyfriend\u201d, say he was going to put it away eventually, and that I was being a bitch.\n\nToday, I got out of work an hour early, walked home a mile from the train station, and decided to cook us a nice pasta dinner. There was a pile of 5 days worth of his clothes on the floor, making me super anxious and annoyed. I avoided asking him to put them away the last several days in fear of arguing.\n\nDinner was almost ready when he got home, and I confronted him. I asked him to please put them away now. He said \u201cin an hour\u201d and proceeded to sit at his computer and play on his gameboy. He complained his feet hurt, even though he works an office job and he drove home. \n\nI told him \u201cplease do it now, I walked home a mile after working all day and it didn\u2019t stop me from making dinner for us.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cif you\u2019re going to hold making dinner over my head, just throw it out\u201d\n\nSo I did. I threw out a whole dinner of pasta and ground beef, because I felt disgusted by the thought of someone who doesn\u2019t respect me or our living space eating food I exhaustedly spent an hour making.\n\nHe freaked out, and said he thinks I have mental problems, because wasting the food was unnecessary and that I\u2019m \u201cerratic\u201d.

Why didn\u2019t you just pack it up and go to a friend\u2019s house or something?  If you were *already* anxious about the mess he made on the floor, why did you even bother to cook for him in the first place?\n\nI can only assume you have enough money to buy more food, since you were so quick to throw out your dinner,  but there\u2019s just something\u2026 immoral about putting food in the trash when there are countless people going hungry.\n\nJust so we\u2019re clear, your boyfriend is an AH too.  Adults shouldn\u2019t have to be reminded about basic cleanliness.  But it sounds like the chores need to be tweaked.  You both need to do your own laundry and cook your own meals.  That way, you won\u2019t feel taken advantage of.  If he can\u2019t be bothered to put his clothes in the hamper, that\u2019ll be his problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019d bet the word he uses next is crazy.\nHe is out to invalidate you. He seems to me like a very nasty person.\nSetting all that aside you both don\u2019t seem compatible. He obviously has a standard of living that\u2019s well below your own. If he\u2019s happy to live in squalor, let him.

Your communication in this relationship with each other is poor and immature. He's a slob if he can't just out things away in a timely fashion. You need therapy if clothes on the floor cause you so much anxiety that you threw good food out because he said to as if it was a challenge. You were spiteful, which is immature.
