I have a few ones that I\u2019m proud of and love and have them hung in my room and bathroom. In the bathroom I have three beach shoots I did and in my room I have a few but the ones she finds an issue with is where I\u2019m topless but completely covering everything with my hands. When I put them up she had no issues at all. She knows what I do and while she isn\u2019t in the same profession is always my number one supporter.\n\nWe have a two bed two bath, each respective room has its own ensuite bathroom. When people come over they just use whichever one but you have to go through the room to get to it. Her bathroom had an issue and is getting completely re done (until June or July) so she\u2019s been using mine in the meantime. A couple days ago her boyfriend came from Maine to stay/live for the unforeseen future. He\u2019s been staying in her room but since she has no bathroom is using mine. I\u2019m not there 24/7 but when I am and they have to use the bathroom I give them 100% privacy and leave my room. I\u2019m also  the one to clean the bathroom.\n\nRoommate said her bf made a comment on my pictures and body and it made her uncomfortable that he\u2019s looking at another girls body. She said if I can take them down and put something else up until her bathrooms done/ he leaves. I said no that they went with the room and that it\u2019s my space I pay rent for. I don\u2019t know when that bathrooms gonna get done or when he\u2019s leaving so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a week kind of a thing. They\u2019re not just straight up pictures on a white wall and are more artistic and like I said I took time designing the wall and framing the pictures. She kept getting on me saying I was being an inconsiderate bitch and that she\u2019s only asking a small favor. She then said \u201ca naked picture isn\u2019t art its trashy\u201d. I told her she didn\u2019t have a problem until he made that comment and that he can get a hotel room if it\u2019s an issue. I said the flaws in her relationship are not my fault. Honestly her bfs a pig and I keep my distance when he\u2019s around. Im also making a big compromise letting him basically live here rent free for her since I don\u2019t feel comfortable with him.\n\nThe other day I came home to the all pictures and paintings I had up shoved under my bed. I was pissed and just put them back up. This is my job and I have an Instagram that he follows btw (I don\u2019t follow back) and likes pictures on with worse pictures than what I have up.

So does your roomate.\n\nOnce you agreed to a third roomate (yeah the conditions of this don\u2019t make sense to me, but it looks like you said ok), you agreed to sharing this bathroom with the third roomate as well. \n\nAs artsy or tasteful they may be, it is weird that this guy can\u2019t use the bathroom without seeing his girlfriends roomate naked. It\u2019s reasonable for your roomate to be uncomfortable with that. It\u2019s reasonable for her to ask you to take them down for 4 months. You lacking the empathy or compassion to do that makes you an asshole.\n\nOn a separate side note, to me this situation looks fucked. It seems like you both need to communicate better. At the very least there needs to be a defined agreement on this third roommate. It\u2019s more weird to me that you don\u2019t follow back your roomate of 3 years boyfriend than that he follows you.

I am using this. Thank you.", "Good point. I wonder if she could claim the landlord is violating the lease? She moved in expecting two bathrooms and now there\u2019s only one.

OP really needs to never be alone with this guy. I seriously wonder if he moved in because it meant being closer to her and had nothing to do with the girlfriend.", "I don\u2019t think that her pictures are nudes. I thought they were lingerie & swimsuit photos. I may be wrong. I agree that they\u2019re not trashy. If she is happy with them then her roommate needs to deal with her own boyfriend.

Your language seems to indicate that you believe that I\u2019ve said otherwise. The fault lays with the landlord here. \n\nUnless the roommate is pooping in a bucket somewhere, or given accommodations elsewhere by the landlord, she is forced to see the photos for the time being. Unless he\u2019s on the lease, roommate\u2019s boyfriend is not, and he can go to his place if he doesn\u2019t want to see them. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean that op is the asshole for not taking them down from what used to be a private space, because it will once again be her private one soon. The polite thing to do would be to take them down temporarily while sharing, but she\u2019s not really a jerk for saying no either. Unless op is paying less in exchange for them sharing the bathroom, she\u2019s totally in the right. \n\nThat being said, where I\u2019m from it\u2019s better to be polite rather than to be right on such a small matter, so I\u2019m biased towards that.", "I just want you to know that\u2019s the most reasonable comment anyone has made on the internet.", "go outside and touch grass", "So the only bathroom.

Wouldn't it be kind of nice for the roomate to take down the pictures of gore to make her friend more comfortable?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe boyfriend is an idiot, and probably a creep, and should probably pay rent while he's there.

In that case as well, the landlord doesn't have to comp rent for something like this. The go-to solution would be terminating the contract and letting you out of the lease. Then there's the burden of apartment shopping and moving.\n\nTo get money back like that, your best bet is taking the landlord to court, but if it's a management company, then they have some pretty good/well paid attorneys.", "She also stated the naked photo her hands are covering anything so it's not even completely nude.", "A lot of people who are models and have photos of themselves taken professionally will usually have them hung up.

Do stuff that makes you uncomfortable because it's the polite thing to do when a dude is being a creep.\n\nThis is a major problem. This is why so many people get away with this kind of behaviour. It would just be so much easier to be polite and take them down then to call a creepy dude out on his behaviour.

That's just being a doormat.", "lmao thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do think it's kind of an ESH situation here.  Like OP is in the right that it's her's her space (when the other bathroom isn't broken). And the boyfriend is a creep, and his creepiness is making her roomate insecure, and he should probably start paying rent if he's over stayed his welcome.  But like...taking down pictures temporarily is the biggest non-issue.", "It\u2019s temporary and it\u2019s still not the roommates bedroom or bathroom.", "It\u2019s a favor because without access to her bathroom they\u2019d be having to go pay for showers, get a small portapotty and deal with that mess and generally be hating life.  It\u2019s not impossible- just very inconvenient.  You can get just as clean taking a sink bath and there is a kitchen.  Like I said - it\u2019s a favor.  A big one really IMO.  So roommate should leave OPs things alone and be grateful they have a place to shit shower and shave instead of trying to force her to redecorate cuz they don\u2019t like the atmosphere!", "I can\u2019t imagine an en-suite bathroom inside a bedroom becoming a common space legally but I don\u2019t live in a big city.

Maybe that\u2019s where things aren\u2019t lining up for you.  It\u2019s body shaming, insecurity, asking for change based on boyfriend\u2019s comments etc.  roommate was fine with decor before the BF started thinking OP was a hottie.  It also would be simple for the roommate to talk to her BF about his comments and how they make her feel.  To think this issue will be fixed by changing the decor is illogical.", "I mean, if it were me and I suddenly had nowhere to use the restroom and my roommate offered me hers I would never judge/comment on if it is messy or not. I would just be thrilled to have a place to use and I would know it was her space.\n\nETA: yeah I think if that scenario was posted on AITA people would find in favor of the bathroom owner. If it\u2019s not your space and someone is doing you a favor, you just suck it up and be grateful.", "Again, who are these hypothetical kids? Kids don\u2019t just appear out of nowhere. Much like vampires, you have to choose to let them in. It\u2019s just an odd assumption to make to me. She\u2019s a 22 year old model, not a nanny, so where do kids come into this at all? \n\nAnd I say this as someone who loves kids and has many sweet nieces, but not everyone has kids who visit their homes.

If the landlord did this, that would def an issue. At most it could be seen as civil, but even that\u2019s a stretch. As far as tenant rights go everyone on the least has rights to the entire unit, but not necessarily guaranteed access. It wouldn\u2019t be seen as a violation to lock her room, and as the bathroom is en-suite AND the roommate has already tampered with personal belongings, i don\u2019t think there would be much luck trying to bring anything to the courts", "Except it's HER bathroom.

Both are paying rent and one had an issue that could very well not be the fault of her roommate. Usually this would be solved in a few days but the landlord knows there is 2 bathrooms so they will not rush to repair it.
