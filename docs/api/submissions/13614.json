I have a few ones that I\u2019m proud of and love and have them hung in my room and bathroom. In the bathroom I have three beach shoots I did and in my room I have a few but the ones she finds an issue with is where I\u2019m topless but completely covering everything with my hands. When I put them up she had no issues at all. She knows what I do and while she isn\u2019t in the same profession is always my number one supporter.\n\nWe have a two bed two bath, each respective room has its own ensuite bathroom. When people come over they just use whichever one but you have to go through the room to get to it. Her bathroom had an issue and is getting completely re done (until June or July) so she\u2019s been using mine in the meantime. A couple days ago her boyfriend came from Maine to stay/live for the unforeseen future. He\u2019s been staying in her room but since she has no bathroom is using mine. I\u2019m not there 24/7 but when I am and they have to use the bathroom I give them 100% privacy and leave my room. I\u2019m also  the one to clean the bathroom.\n\nRoommate said her bf made a comment on my pictures and body and it made her uncomfortable that he\u2019s looking at another girls body. She said if I can take them down and put something else up until her bathrooms done/ he leaves. I said no that they went with the room and that it\u2019s my space I pay rent for. I don\u2019t know when that bathrooms gonna get done or when he\u2019s leaving so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a week kind of a thing.

She kept getting on me saying I was being an inconsiderate bitch and that she\u2019s only asking a small favor. She then said \u201ca naked picture isn\u2019t art its trashy\u201d. I told her she didn\u2019t have a problem until he made that comment and that he can get a hotel room if it\u2019s an issue. I said the flaws in her relationship are not my fault. Honestly her bfs a pig and I keep my distance when he\u2019s around. Im also making a big compromise letting him basically live here rent free for her since I don\u2019t feel comfortable with him.\n\nThe other day I came home to the all pictures and paintings I had up shoved under my bed. I was pissed and just put them back up. This is my job and I have an Instagram that he follows btw (I don\u2019t follow back) and likes pictures on with worse pictures than what I have up.

Once the other bathroom broke, that became both of your bathrooms. The reason the landlord can wait 4 months to repair it is because you have another bathroom. You say you pay rent for your bathroom. So does your roomate.\n\nOnce you agreed to a third roomate (yeah the conditions of this don\u2019t make sense to me, but it looks like you said ok), you agreed to sharing this bathroom with the third roomate as well. \n\nAs artsy or tasteful they may be, it is weird that this guy can\u2019t use the bathroom without seeing his girlfriends roomate naked. It\u2019s reasonable for your roomate to be uncomfortable with that. It\u2019s reasonable for her to ask you to take them down for 4 months. You lacking the empathy or compassion to do that makes you an asshole.\n\nOn a separate side note, to me this situation looks fucked. It seems like you both need to communicate better. At the very least there needs to be a defined agreement on this third roommate. It\u2019s more weird to me that you don\u2019t follow back your roomate of 3 years boyfriend than that he follows you. It\u2019s weird to me that you allowed someone you have such disdain for to live with you and see your tits every morning after coffee.", "NTA \nShe\u2019s insecure about her boyfriend clearly.

If i were you i would put my pride aside and just take the pictures down for the time being. Her asking politely for you to take them down until she gets her bathroom back is not an unreasonable demand and she was really nice about it.

I wouldn\u2019t want my husband seeing an another girl half naked everytime he goes to the bathroom either.

No, you\u2019re gonna cook carrots on the side for yourself only and not include them in the actual dish. It\u2019s the same concept, not everyone feels comfortable with the pictures you have.
