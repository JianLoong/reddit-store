She even tried suggesting just driving there and back after a day because \"your only 4 hours away we can drive back home in time\". Once again I told her no. I personally also don't want her coming along because she always tries to start fights with my boyfriend anytime he makes a joke towards me. I told her she always joins in on trips I plan and that I just want some alone time with my boyfriend on this trip. Ever since I told her no she hardly talks to me and even blocked me on her phone.

The best advice anyone ever gave me is not to \"JADE\" Justify, argue, defend or explain. Just say no, she can't come. you don't need to give ANY explanation as to why. Aside from maybe that this is a trip for you and your boyfriend. You don't need to say anything more.", "NTA.  It's your vacation, not hers.  If she wants to go to Baltimore, then she can book time off and go.", "Agreed, NTA. Besides, I find it weird that she would want to go on a trip with you and your boyfriend. I mean, wouldn\u2019t she feel kind of a third wheel?\n\nSuper weird question, and pardon me for asking: does she want to go really because she\u2019s never been to Baltimore before, or does she have an ulterior motive? Or would she still have wanted to go if it was you and let\u2019s say your sister or another female friend?\n\nBy the way, good for you OP for saying no and setting boundaries and not letting her guilt trip you into saying yes. You did the right thing. \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence. \n\nEdit: questions and paragraph", "NTA, your friend is for pressuring and bullying you. You should not have to make excuses either. She is not invited this time. Done.", "NTA. Who the hell invited themselves along a couple\u2019s vacation? Also, why are you friends with this person? It doesn\u2019t sound like she treats you nicely.", "NTA - Oh no, she blocked you. How heartbreaking. Whatever will you do? \n\nSeriously though, let her throw her little temper tantrum. Eventually she will realize that you are not going to give in to her manipulation. At that point she will either move on like nothing happened or look for a new friend that she gives into her bulldozer ways.", "NTA.  Not sure why she would even want to the be the third wheel on a vacation in the first place.  But the moment you told her no, she should have accepted that and moved on.", "Of course NTA.  Your friend is crossing some major boundaries here.  Let her throw her little hissy fit.", "NTA. She is. If she blocks you, that is a relief from her begging. Why would she want to be the third wheel?", "NTA. Couples deserve time to themselves with no one else around. Your \u201cfriend\u201d sounds way too attached to you. Really who wants to be the third wheel on a vacation anyways? Plus, it sounds like she\u2019s never really been your friend anyways.", "Nta- may be let the nc stand and find another set of friends", "NTA. \n\nLet her keep you blocked. \n\nYou are allowed to take trips with just your boyfriend, regardless of the reasons. A romantic trip is valid, just as a friend trip is valid, or any other type of vacation. \n\nAnd then there is no reason for her to need to be on this trip. It's not like you promised to go to Baltimore with her, there's no special thing about this trip that lets her stake a claim here. \n\nShe isn't being a good friend by taking the \"no\" graciously, and if she would throw the friendship away over it, let her. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, so go enjoy your trip!", "NTA. It's a little getaway as a couple. I think she sounds clueless and doesn't get that it's a romantic getaway. No third wheels invited.", "NTA.  All you have to say is it is a trip for just you and the BF.  That's it.  It should be obvious at just that.  It's rude to try and invite herself along on couple time unless you agree to it.  Seeing as she's a bully, I wouldn't agree to take a trip with her ever again.", "NTA. It is one of the most reasonable things in the world to not want to have a third person to come along on your vacation. She asked once, which is fine, and you said no. Once she started harassing you about it, she crossed a line. That alone makes me understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to go on vacation with her. \n\nAs far as her not talking to you, take that as a blessing. At least you don\u2019t have to worry about her bugging you any more.", "NTA not even close. This is the first one I've read where there is no gray area in my mind. She is TA for asking! She should know better and be respectful of your boyfriend vacation time. I don't know anybody that would ask such a thing.
