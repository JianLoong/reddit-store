You have a TBI. NTA, but please reconsider this relationship. She should be worried about YOU, not about whether or not you recognize her. She's selfish.", "This is a sad story.  I\u2019m going NTA, I understand her being upset but she took it too far and you being an AH in this is just not possible.  I wish you the best and I hope you get the medical care you need.", "NTA just leave that she\u2019s not going to be helpful for you or your recovery. This will always be about her and your inability to do whatever for her.\n\nShe owes you a huge apology for not understanding the medical condition you told her and sent her links about. That\u2019s fkd up.", "NTA-You gave her a heads up and sent her articles so I'm really surprised by her reaction. She was not very understanding.  I don't think you owe her an apology but she owes you one for sure.", "NTA. She should apologize and not make this about her. If she doesn\u2019t, unclear that she is the best match for you.", "NTA, that\u2019s a genuine medical condition that she should be ready to give leeway for. Maybe start wearing a \u201csignature\u201d necklace or set of earrings etc.", "NTA the symptoms of a TBI aren\u2019t a reflection of how much you care about her.  But I could argue the fact that she didn\u2019t read the info you sent her does reflect how much she cares about you.", "NTA. \n\nI'm so sorry OP. I have mild propognasia, and it can be very disorientating. It's heartbreaking that rather than support you, your girlfriend has to make your traumatic experience and current condition about herself. She doesn't understand how scary it can be to not recognize the faces of people you love, and how isolating that can be. She seems to only care about whether you're showing the right amount of investment in her, even though you literally can't help it. \n\nI hope your recovery goes smoothly!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs someone with a TBI, surround yourself with a solid support group. Your girlfriend doesnt seem to be the one to help you.", "NTA\n\nYour condition is a true test of your relationship, and it sounds like your girlfriend did not prepare herself for this meeting despite your efforts to get her up to speed with your new reality. Is she a quick study, or would reading articles pose problems for her? \n\nTry to remember why you were drawn to each other and practice patience while you are transitioning to your life as you now know it. This may take adjustment time. If you are both quick to anger or are challenged when coping with frustration, you may have to take things slowly. \n\nI sympathize with you as I have difficulty with facial recognition, often waiting for someone to speak before making that connection\u2014even with people I know. (This is not to say I fully understand your experience as it is probably a mere fraction of the struggle you face daily.)\n\nBest wishes for good health and discovering ways to work around the impact of your TBI.", "NTA. \n\nThis is very sad.\n\nIf she doesn't shape up and start being sympathetic/understanding about your TBI... get a new girlfriend. You deserve better.", "NTA.  She is though for not trying to understand what is affecting you.", "NTA what an odd thing to get mad over. You legit have a medical condition and instead of understanding, she\u2019s trying to make it look like it\u2019s your fault. Things like this don\u2019t choose who they would recognize or not. It\u2019s hard.", "NTA. Run!", "I am sorry you are joining the TBI group, we never want to welcome anyone else. I know all TBIs have different issues. But it\u2019s seems that all need rest and stress makes symptoms worse. I wish you  healing. You did great with sending information and explaining the face blindness. While I understand she is taking it personally, it isn\u2019t. Your world has been turned upside. You did nothing wrong and don\u2019t need to apologize. You will need family/friends that are supportive and helping as you heal and adjust to any new symptoms. If you are still in the hospital them to put a sign on the door asking everyone to introduce themselves to you everyone they enter. You need everyone to try do everything that can help out and your loved ones will want to do that.", "Absolutely NTA you have a medical condition she could of Been more acceptable to this.", "NTA - you can't control the fact that you have TBI. You're also right to be hurt over this. If she can't grip the fact that you don't recognize her due to face blindness, then that's on her.", "NTA, and my advice would be to dump her. She\u2019s just shown you how unsympathetic she\u2019s going to be about a major problem in your life. You deserve much better than that!", "NTA, I think when something like this happens, people want to believe they're the exception because the bond is so strong no medical condition can stop it. Now she realizes this is the real world and not Disney and its upsetting.", "You are far from an AH. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry that you have had to go through all of this. I\u2019m also very sorry that your girlfriend is making your medical condition about her. You have nothing to apologize for. \n\nYou gave her information about your condition before she came to visit you and experience for herself what your reality now looks like. Not only does it appear that she neglected to even read it but she is victim blaming you for her own insecurities.\n\nHopefully she can recognize that your medical condition is not about her and she will step up for you. \n\nAlternatively, she can see herself out if she can\u2019t adjust to the new normal.  \n\nNTA", "NTA- Everyone could have stood to be a bit more understanding to be honest. It has to be incredibly jarring to hear that you could recognize your immediate family but not her. She probably needs more time. \n\nI changed my vote to NTA because she should not have been acting angry while you are injured, though I can understand her being hurt. Just my two cents for this situation going forward: as someone who also struggles to recognize faces, I generally apologize before asking people who they are. It's just a matter of tact. Apologizing doesn't kill me and no one gives me shit for not recognizing them.", "NTA\nYour girlfriend is probably more scared than mad that you didn\u2019t recognize her.  Tell her to read those articles while in the room about your condition so she can understand.", "NTA. If you had a spinal injury is it also  cool for her to be like omg you can't get out of your wheelchair and walk for me, I must not be important enough for you. Yes, it's undoubtedly hard on her but at the end of the day you are the one injured, she should do her best to be understanding and caring to you. And yes, later absolutely find one of her friends and family for support and cry to them that you couldn't recognize her. She shouldn't be dumping that on you.", "NTA. TBI\u2019s require a lot of patience from the patient and their support system. I\u2019ve been through this with a family member, and I don\u2019t think your girlfriend has the sensitivity or adaptability that would make her a valuable part of your support system.", "I'm so sorry and you of course are Nta", "NAH. This is hard for you, and it is going to be hard for her. You don't have to apologize for your condition, but the shock of it is still going to hurt her. If you're serious with her, you should both get some counseling.", "I honestly don\u2019t know what to say OP, I can see it from both sides- I\u2019d be hurt but you also can\u2019t help it, I\u2019m giving a NTA, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an asshole either", "NAH\n\ni think your GF was upset that your injury was as severe as it is.

I hope you don't mind but I'm going to write down some tips and tricks that have helped me over the years.  \n\nI remember hair color and hair cut style best.  Let people talk and try to learn people's cadence.  If you're out and someone recognizes you, talk with them and if they seem offended, I always get away with \"I'm such a space cadet.  What's your name?\"  Or \"I have a lot on my mind.  Can you please help me out on what your name is?\"\n\nIf you go out in public and you're with someone, a tip that helps me is to take their picture and play it off like \"You're so gorgeous today.  I just want to take a picture to remind you of it.\" Or \"I like that shirt you're wearing.  Can I take a quick picture to look it up later?\"  \"Those shoes look so comfortable.  I'd love to look up that shoe style later.\"  That way you can see what they are wearing if you split off and can't remember what they look like.\n\nMy boyfriend looks like a typical white guy so if I go up to someone and they aren't him, I can play it off like, \"You're as hot as my boyfriend.  No wonder I made that kinda mistake.\"  or \"You look like the better looking twin of my friend.\"\n\nI'm sorry this has happened to you.  :(\n\n\nEDIT: For workplaces, I always call my superiors boss no matter how high up they are.  You can always get away with calling people sir / ma'am.  Fellow coworkers on my tier, I just say \"Hey friend, can you help me with x?\"", "Nta. Not in anyway.

Just because you have a condition doesn\u2019t make your girlfriend\u2019s emotional needs magically disappear.\n\nThe very least you could have done is apologized to her and sympathized with the pain she\u2019s going through, knowing that her literal LOVER sees her as any stranger walking down the street.\n\nI hope she dumps your insensitive and emotionally abusive ass, OP.", "Thank you for your well wishes", "Thanks for your well wishes.

This is not some Disney BS movie where true love conquers all! That just comes across to me as manipulation (and maybe some potential gaslighting?) Sorry, but she needs to grow the hell up. I would be fucking FLOORED if I told my significant other that I have a medical condition, sent a bunch of stuff explaining it, then they came to visit me and got pissed off because of the thing I tried to explain.
