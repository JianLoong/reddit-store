I have mild propognasia, and it can be very disorientating. It's heartbreaking that rather than support you, your girlfriend has to make your traumatic experience and current condition about herself.

While I understand she is taking it personally, it isn\u2019t. Your world has been turned upside. You did nothing wrong and don\u2019t need to apologize. You will need family/friends that are supportive and helping as you heal and adjust to any new symptoms.

She\u2019s just shown you how unsympathetic she\u2019s going to be about a major problem in your life.

It has to be incredibly jarring to hear that you could recognize your immediate family but not her. She probably needs more time. \n\nI changed my vote to NTA because she should not have been acting angry while you are injured, though I can understand her being hurt. Just my two cents for this situation going forward: as someone who also struggles to recognize faces, I generally apologize before asking people who they are. It's just a matter of tact. Apologizing doesn't kill me and no one gives me shit for not recognizing them.", "NTA\nYour girlfriend is probably more scared than mad that you didn\u2019t recognize her.

TBI\u2019s require a lot of patience from the patient and their support system.

I hope you don't mind but I'm going to write down some tips and tricks that have helped me over the years.  \n\nI remember hair color and hair cut style best.  Let people talk and try to learn people's cadence.  If you're out and someone recognizes you, talk with them and if they seem offended, I always get away with \"I'm such a space cadet.  What's your name?\"  Or \"I have a lot on my mind.  Can you please help me out on what your name is?\"\n\nIf you go out in public and you're with someone, a tip that helps me is to take their picture and play it off like \"You're so gorgeous today.  I just want to take a picture to remind you of it.\" Or \"I like that shirt you're wearing.  Can I take a quick picture to look it up later?\"  \"Those shoes look so comfortable.  I'd love to look up that shoe style later.\"  That way you can see what they are wearing if you split off and can't remember what they look like.\n\nMy boyfriend looks like a typical white guy so if I go up to someone and they aren't him, I can play it off like, \"You're as hot as my boyfriend.  No wonder I made that kinda mistake.\"  or \"You look like the better looking twin of my friend.\"\n\nI'm sorry this has happened to you.  :(\n\n\nEDIT: For workplaces, I always call my superiors boss no matter how high up they are.

Your condition has nothing to do with her and is not something you can control or cure. She needs to grow up a bit and realise that this isn't about her and that how much you love someone doesn't affect if you can recognise them. \n\nIt is about how long you have known them and how well you have committed many other details about them to memory. People without prosopagnosia have brains that don't really need to worry about all the other details about people, so it takes active training to learn how to not only pay attention to these things, but to also call on these details in a quick enough fashion to be functional day to day. You will learn these tricks and you will be able to function, but it will not be like before. \n\nLiving with prosopagnosia is a very weird feeling and can be very isolating, especially if you're newly diagnosed. Take the time you need to process your own feelings and surround yourself with people who support you. Take some space from your girlfriend and let her, too, process her own feelings on this situation. If she is too immature or insecure to handle it, you don't need her around you right now.

I always recognise her.\n\nMy mother is more difficult -  she dresses pretty much identically to many women of her age..    her hair is the same as many women her age,  and it's in a style that covers her ears and partially obscures her jawline.\n\nI don't always recognise her if i bump into her when i'm out.\n\nMen are generally easier for me because their appearance doesn't tend to change much on a day by day basis.   They tend to have short hair,  so i can recognise people by things like the shape of their jaw..  their hair style and hairline.  Their ears,  nose,  eyes etc.\n\nWomen are more difficult due to changing hair cuts and colours..  styles -  makeup etc.  Their hair often obscures the ears or some of the jaw.", "Your girlfriend made it all about her instead of you.

I second the idea of giving your gf a piece of jewelry (I\u2019d suggest a necklace) to recognize her easier.\n\nMy teacher told a story about how her best friend pranked her once by dressing like one of their professors and pretending to be them, which worked. So she was able to recognize people by their general fashion style.", "I wish you the best with it. I have face blindness of medium severity and I have learned/adapted well enough to sell product in a role where I have (financial incentive) to remember faces/names/orders. While the problems with context are really hard (someone running into you in an environment where you don't normally see them will just wreck your ability to recognize them probably), at this point I can recognize people at a two city block distance. And I'm half blind with myopia! When you can't recognize the faces you will quickly find yourself picking out how they walk, their posture, and the specific sound their keys make in their pocket - weird little things that confidently tell you at great distance \"that's my family/spouse/friend!\". So... I can't say I recommend face blindness, the confusion has been pretty hilarious in the past and I've had to learn subtle ways to ask how I know you, but weirdly I can recognize my customers and friends better than a person with good eyesight and without face blindness.\n\nIt's also wild, because it definitely a learned and trained skill. I'm better at it than I used to be. And it can benefit you in weird ways, people rely on their facial ability and movies/show etc think that's the only way to recognize someone so you find yourself in situations where you're so confused how everyone else *doesn't* recognize that one character and you realize that their identity has been obscured.... to someone who can read faces.\n\nSo I guess I mean to say, there's no cure, but with learning you do really recognize people *almost* as fast, and in some ways more thoroughly.

You have more than enough on your plate and she needs to be handling her own emotional response (whatever it may be) in a much more mature way.
