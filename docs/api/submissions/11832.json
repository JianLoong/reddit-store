I have mild propognasia, and it can be very disorientating. It's heartbreaking that rather than support you, your girlfriend has to make your traumatic experience and current condition about herself.

While I understand she is taking it personally, it isn\u2019t. Your world has been turned upside. You did nothing wrong and don\u2019t need to apologize. You will need family/friends that are supportive and helping as you heal and adjust to any new symptoms.

She\u2019s just shown you how unsympathetic she\u2019s going to be about a major problem in your life.

It has to be incredibly jarring to hear that you could recognize your immediate family but not her. She probably needs more time. \n\nI changed my vote to NTA because she should not have been acting angry while you are injured, though I can understand her being hurt. Just my two cents for this situation going forward: as someone who also struggles to recognize faces, I generally apologize before asking people who they are. It's just a matter of tact. Apologizing doesn't kill me and no one gives me shit for not recognizing them.", "NTA\nYour girlfriend is probably more scared than mad that you didn\u2019t recognize her.

I hope you don't mind but I'm going to write down some tips and tricks that have helped me over the years.  \n\nI remember hair color and hair cut style best.  Let people talk and try to learn people's cadence.  If you're out and someone recognizes you, talk with them and if they seem offended, I always get away with \"I'm such a space cadet.  What's your name?\"  Or \"I have a lot on my mind.  Can you please help me out on what your name is?\"\n\nIf you go out in public and you're with someone, a tip that helps me is to take their picture and play it off like \"You're so gorgeous today.  I just want to take a picture to remind you of it.\" Or \"I like that shirt you're wearing.  Can I take a quick picture to look it up later?\"  \"Those shoes look so comfortable.  I'd love to look up that shoe style later.\"  That way you can see what they are wearing if you split off and can't remember what they look like.\n\nMy boyfriend looks like a typical white guy so if I go up to someone and they aren't him, I can play it off like, \"You're as hot as my boyfriend.  No wonder I made that kinda mistake.\"  or \"You look like the better looking twin of my friend.\"\n\nI'm sorry this has happened to you.  :(\n\n\nEDIT: For workplaces, I always call my superiors boss no matter how high up they are.

I found exercise moving across my body, that requires tons of concentration, really helpful in repairing some of the damage. I had to use meds to get reading back though. I am still on them, but it\u2019s all good. I can read!", "NTA. May you be in good health.", "You aren\u2019t the asshole here, but as someone who has had prosopagnosia for a long time, know that people will get offended, no matter how it\u2019s explained to them. Your best survival mechanism is going to be generic conversations to gather context. Practice small talk, asking people how they are doing, what they\u2019ve been working on, etc. You\u2019re already doing a great job recognizing voices, the vague, fact-finding small talk will come with time (with some effort). Good luck navigating this new world!", "Honestly, I\u2019m a little worried that she hears you\u2019ve had something horrible happen and are struggling, and she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to read the resources. Not only that, she made what happened to you about her. \n\nI hope your road to recovery is smooth and that those you love support you along it, as you deserve. I would caution you against keeping people around who are upsetting and hinder your progress rather than supporting it.\n\nNTA.", "I think her actions were pretty telling.", "Agreed. Hopefully she's less self absorbed through OPs healing process. \nNTA, and big hugs, OP!", "I go by body shape and clothing and hair style but mostly voice.  Faces mean very little to me.", "I'm not in any way trying to minimize her reaction or your very understandable feelings, but remember that facial prosopagnosia is an unusual disorder and one that takes time for a person, whether the patient or a loved one, to become accustomed to. \n\nYour girlfriend's reaction may have been anger, but it was likely mixed with a good bit of fear and \"startle,\" because all the texts and literature in the world can't prepare a person for seeing their significant other look straight at them and not recognize their face, just like all the literature and explanations in the world probably couldn't really prepare you for looking at people you know and not recognizing their faces. This will take a while. I am sorry you're going through this, but you'll learn ways of accommodating. Same judgment as before - N  A  H, just two people having to adjust to an unexpected new reality.", "Yeah dude. Don't apologize to her. I can understand that it might be upsetting to her that you can't recognize her but in that moment she should have sucked it up and not gotten mad at you of all things.  Right now it's not about her. You had a life altering accident. You are still hospitalized and haven't even really started any healing process. Even if she had been upset in the moment she never even asked about you. She told about how what happened to you was affecting HER. Not, I didn't realize how hard this would be for you but omg you don't love or care about ME enough. Such a crappy thing for her to do.", "I have prosopagnosia as part of my autism diagnosis. It will get easier, although I can't imagine how traumatic it must be to have suddenly acquired this disability. I've had 30 years of practice and I still mix up close family members, but I'm at least able to recognize that I do know the person. The issue here is that your existing brain file of your girlfriend's face is now hopelessly corrupted, like a broken computer file. You have to create a new one, in a whole new operating system that you're only just starting to learn. She needs to be patient and help you relearn her face.", "Better than what? Someone who doesn't want to be abused because they have a brain injury?", "He literally can't recognize anyone? She's playing the victim and has no right to do so. She needs to stop blaming him for a medical condition out of his control. She doesn't deserve an apology because he has done nothing wrong. He deserves a partner in his corner. Not kicking him while he's down.", "You appear to misunderstand what facial prosopagnosia is. OP can look at his girlfriend, his nurse, and his mother standing side by side and not be able to distinguish between their faces. It's a very hard disorder to live with, and for someone like OP's girlfriend, who hasn't experienced this before, it's a very hard thing to understand.\n\n It is also very, very common for the family and close friends of people who have true prosopagnosia to wear a particular color near their face, a hair ribbon, bow tie, or, yes, a specific piece of jewelry which enables the person with prosopagnosia to recognize this person. UnfortuateDaring actually made quite a good suggestion.\n\nThis is new diagnosis of a rare and poorly understood disorder, and as such it's awful for both OP and for his girlfriend. They both need time to get used to what really is a \"new normal.\" NAH.", "It's selfish to want to be able to recognize her? Sounds like you don't understand his now permanent disability. Having identifiers is ESSENTIAL for those with face blindness. This could be colored hair, accessories, etc. But I bet you'd be even more mad if op suggested she dye a strand of her hair huh? Cut the bs having her wear something like a bracelet or necklace is nothing. If wanting to be able to recognize your gf is selfish then so be it, I guess she'll never be recognized again by op", "Found the girlfriend ...", "lol this is 100% the girlfriends burner. new account created solely to reply to this post", "It's weird you think people should cater to your health issues but can't give another person the benefit of the doubt."]}
