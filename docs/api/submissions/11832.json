I have mild propognasia, and it can be very disorientating. It's heartbreaking that rather than support you, your girlfriend has to make your traumatic experience and current condition about herself.

While I understand she is taking it personally, it isn\u2019t. Your world has been turned upside. You did nothing wrong and don\u2019t need to apologize. You will need family/friends that are supportive and helping as you heal and adjust to any new symptoms.

She\u2019s just shown you how unsympathetic she\u2019s going to be about a major problem in your life.

It has to be incredibly jarring to hear that you could recognize your immediate family but not her. She probably needs more time. \n\nI changed my vote to NTA because she should not have been acting angry while you are injured, though I can understand her being hurt. Just my two cents for this situation going forward: as someone who also struggles to recognize faces, I generally apologize before asking people who they are. It's just a matter of tact. Apologizing doesn't kill me and no one gives me shit for not recognizing them.", "NTA\nYour girlfriend is probably more scared than mad that you didn\u2019t recognize her.

TBI\u2019s require a lot of patience from the patient and their support system.

I hope you don't mind but I'm going to write down some tips and tricks that have helped me over the years.  \n\nI remember hair color and hair cut style best.  Let people talk and try to learn people's cadence.  If you're out and someone recognizes you, talk with them and if they seem offended, I always get away with \"I'm such a space cadet.  What's your name?\"  Or \"I have a lot on my mind.  Can you please help me out on what your name is?\"\n\nIf you go out in public and you're with someone, a tip that helps me is to take their picture and play it off like \"You're so gorgeous today.  I just want to take a picture to remind you of it.\" Or \"I like that shirt you're wearing.  Can I take a quick picture to look it up later?\"  \"Those shoes look so comfortable.  I'd love to look up that shoe style later.\"  That way you can see what they are wearing if you split off and can't remember what they look like.\n\nMy boyfriend looks like a typical white guy so if I go up to someone and they aren't him, I can play it off like, \"You're as hot as my boyfriend.  No wonder I made that kinda mistake.\"  or \"You look like the better looking twin of my friend.\"\n\nI'm sorry this has happened to you.  :(\n\n\nEDIT: For workplaces, I always call my superiors boss no matter how high up they are.

Hello stranger. \n\nThey used to get mad at me and worried about me until I got a neurologist who diagnosed prosopagnosia.

It is mortifying. But explaining prosopagnosia generally fixes the problem. \n\nThe fact that your girlfriend, someone who is supposed to love you and stick by you when you are injured or sick, is not only mad at you but refusing to see reason, shows poor maturity and a very self-centered view of the world. Your condition has nothing to do with her and is not something you can control or cure. She needs to grow up a bit and realise that this isn't about her and that how much you love someone doesn't affect if you can recognise them. \n\nIt is about how long you have known them and how well you have committed many other details about them to memory. People without prosopagnosia have brains that don't really need to worry about all the other details about people, so it takes active training to learn how to not only pay attention to these things, but to also call on these details in a quick enough fashion to be functional day to day. You will learn these tricks and you will be able to function, but it will not be like before. \n\nLiving with prosopagnosia is a very weird feeling and can be very isolating, especially if you're newly diagnosed. Take the time you need to process your own feelings and surround yourself with people who support you. Take some space from your girlfriend and let her, too, process her own feelings on this situation. If she is too immature or insecure to handle it, you don't need her around you right now.

I always recognise her.\n\nMy mother is more difficult -  she dresses pretty much identically to many women of her age..    her hair is the same as many women her age,  and it's in a style that covers her ears and partially obscures her jawline.\n\nI don't always recognise her if i bump into her when i'm out.\n\nMen are generally easier for me because their appearance doesn't tend to change much on a day by day basis.   They tend to have short hair,  so i can recognise people by things like the shape of their jaw..  their hair style and hairline.  Their ears,  nose,  eyes etc.\n\nWomen are more difficult due to changing hair cuts and colours..  styles -  makeup etc.  Their hair often obscures the ears or some of the jaw.", "Your girlfriend made it all about her instead of you.

I second the idea of giving your gf a piece of jewelry (I\u2019d suggest a necklace) to recognize her easier.\n\nMy teacher told a story about how her best friend pranked her once by dressing like one of their professors and pretending to be them, which worked. So she was able to recognize people by their general fashion style.", "I wish you the best with it. I have face blindness of medium severity and I have learned/adapted well enough to sell product in a role where I have (financial incentive) to remember faces/names/orders. While the problems with context are really hard (someone running into you in an environment where you don't normally see them will just wreck your ability to recognize them probably), at this point I can recognize people at a two city block distance. And I'm half blind with myopia! When you can't recognize the faces you will quickly find yourself picking out how they walk, their posture, and the specific sound their keys make in their pocket - weird little things that confidently tell you at great distance \"that's my family/spouse/friend!\". So... I can't say I recommend face blindness, the confusion has been pretty hilarious in the past and I've had to learn subtle ways to ask how I know you, but weirdly I can recognize my customers and friends better than a person with good eyesight and without face blindness.\n\nIt's also wild, because it definitely a learned and trained skill. I'm better at it than I used to be. And it can benefit you in weird ways, people rely on their facial ability and movies/show etc think that's the only way to recognize someone so you find yourself in situations where you're so confused how everyone else *doesn't* recognize that one character and you realize that their identity has been obscured.... to someone who can read faces.\n\nSo I guess I mean to say, there's no cure, but with learning you do really recognize people *almost* as fast, and in some ways more thoroughly.

Sometimes it looks like fear, but sometimes it kinda doesn't. Anger is a pretty common manifestation actually (makes up the \"fight\" part of \"fight or flight\"). So the fact that she seemed angry isn't really a disqualification, and could actually support the idea she's scared.\n\nThat's still not your problem. You have more than enough on your plate and she needs to be handling her own emotional response (whatever it may be) in a much more mature way.

It's like I'm seeing them for the first time. \n\nAnd you're totally right - it's just become normal for me to try and find strategies to figure out who a person is without needing to ask.

You shouldn't have to feel guilty for upsetting someone who should understand that it's not personal and has no bearing on your feelings for her. She's being selfish.

My clients with prosopagnosia usually relied on recognizing voices to identify people, even close family members.", "Nta. She took your medical emergency and made it about her...yikes. I understand it would be painful to not be remembered. Watching my grandma with dementia not remembering my mom tore her apart. But you just re-introduce yourself and cry later.

Have her sit in with the doctors, nurses, specialist to ask questions and hear from them about what is going on and how to manage and work with you.

Life isn't a Hallmark movie where a loved one inspires a miraculous recovery. (If it was, I wouldn't misrecognize my own mother sometimes.)

He asked what the matter was, and she told him she had just dreamed they were walking down the street with their kids and a car full of strippers pulled up, and my brother got in the car and rode off with them (note: my brother doesn't go to strip clubs and has never cheated on his wife). Make a long story short, my brother ended up apologizing to his wife for cheating on her in **her** dreams.\n\nI think you may be in a similar situation.

Either ways you're NTA and she just fucking sucks.

It's hard for everyone, yes, but OP has to come to terms with this neurological disorder and change the way he interacts with others.\n\nOther people in OP's life should be more understanding and work with him to figure out how to identify themselves in a different way.

But other people I don't recognize when I should,  and I seem to have trouble \"processing\" faces. \n\nY'all ever seen that show Orphan Black? It's not a spoiler to say that the premise is the main character keeps meeting identical twins, because secret cloning project. All played by the same actress, who was amazing. But they would introduce a new character and I'd be looking back and forth between these two people who are literally face to face on the screen, and struggling to tell if it is in fact the same person and here's a new clone.\n\nAlso struggle with those dramatic TV moments where like, the hoodie is pulled back and DUN DUN DUN! the killer is revealed! And I'm sitting there like, is that the husband? Wait, I think it's the cop...\n\nNames as well - once a former coworker stopped by to say hi when I was the only one there. I recognized her but wracked my brain for months afterwards trying to come up with her name and absolutely could not. Of course she was like say hi to everyone from me!

(This isn't indicative of stupidity, mind you - I'm a successful software engineer and a published author. The brilliant neurologist Oliver Sacks also was faceblind).\n\nI've learned to adapt, over 40+ years of dealing with this condition. I recognize people by voice, by situation, by hairstyle, by clothing, by mannerisms. You're still learning to deal with this! You can't be an expert in these techniques in such a short time.\n\nNTA.

It probably seems as if her BF is gone forever.", "It really depends haha if the characters all look very similar I can get confused (I will watch movies not realising that there are 2 characters not 1 sometimes lol) but tbh there\u2019s usually enough work done by hair and costumes and also context cues that it\u2019s obvious. I will often read the Wikipedia summary for help. Game of thrones took me 2-3 seasons to be able to identify characters and figure out what happened because there were so many characters and they were dressed similarly enough.\n\nI can recognise faces somewhat but I am not as accurate as others. If people are very obviously different in predictable locations it\u2019s easier, or if I am regularly seeing them it\u2019s easier. If people are in an unexpected environment, people look similar, or I haven\u2019t seen people in a while I will get confused.", "holy fuck. what a vile person.", "I worked with people with different types of brain injury for over a decade, and  so many people tend to lose a lot of their social network after an injury.  They'll often say how their injury showed them who their real friends were.  A common thread is that invisible disabilities are much harder to get across to others than any kind of physical problems. People will accommodate a paralyzed arm way more easily than they will someone with memory problems.", "If it helps, people have been really nice about my husband's face blindness. I have pretty distinctive hair and glasses so most of the time he recognizes me. But he's walked right by me in restaurants and on the street and one time he thought someone else was me. This happened more than 10 years into our relationship. He probably apologized because that's just his nature, but I don't think he should have. \n\nIt doesn't happen a lot because I have adapted to it. When I'm meeting him I immediately greet him in a way that lets him know who I am. \n\nWhen we're getting to know new people, I often discreetly tell them about it so that he doesn't have to. I tell them the stories about the times he didn't recognize me. I think that usually brings it home to people. If he doesn't recognize his own wife, it's hard to get offended if he doesn't recognize them. \n\nI usually disclose his social anxiety at the same time (part of the reason I'm doing the disclosure about his face blindness). Half of the time people self-disclose back about their social anxieties, introversion, or other mental health issues. But they're always understanding.  \n\nPeople are pretty live and let live here in Queens so that might be contributing to it. When you're cramming immigrants from a few hundred cultures and dozens of religions into a very densely packed area, you learn to stop expecting people to conform to your expectations. I think the younger generations are also helping as they have a lot more awareness about mental health, etc (we're Gen X).", "I think the point of that anecdote was probably asking is it worth it to die on this hill and be right? Sudden disability is hard on the person affected, but it still affects those around them and especially partners. When you share your life with someone, you inevitably end up sharing some of the hardship of your disability and it's still an adjustment period for OP's gf. I think she can't relate so it's hard to understand right away and she naively thought somehow she was going to be an exception. He said she hadn't even had a chance to see him in hospital until that time. I'm not sure how long/serious their relationship is and many things depend on that.\n\nI don't think it's right to demonize her for not accepting it right away because a TBI changes a lot about what is possible in their relationship and puts limitations on them that she probably didn't expect. It's up to OP if he wants to give her time or feels it's not worth the added stress. But I suppose I'm trying hard to be kind because I feel I know a bit what she's going through. My partner experienced a physical injury (spinal injury though, not brain) a few years ago and I definitely felt frustrated at the loss of potential goals, the reality of adjusting to his loss of mobility and the way it affects both of us, and just a million small things. It took about a year for us both to come to terms with what disability means and how it changes your life. And yes there was a period in which I wondered if I could do this for the rest of my life - live with the limitations of including him in all the things I want to do despite my otherwise active and able bodied lifestyle. He had to learn to ask for help, and to not take out his frustration on me when he failed to ask and pushed himself too hard, or when he refused to accept help and had to live with the consequences (a lot of pain). I had to learn when to offer my help, to do it more often, and to accept that I can't assume he will be able to assist on certain things because it's outside of his abilities now. I learned to ask \"do you think you can handle this?\" and he had to learn that sometimes the answer is just no.\n\nEdit: for OP and his gf the adjustments are things like can she handle needing to remind him who she is? Maybe they can come up with a routine every time they reunite. Can she support him in reminding him who other people are in a kind and sensitive way? Can he get past the embarrassment of needing that help? Can he devise strategies to identify people that doesn't include coming right out and saying \"who are you?\" to their face which rightfully hurts some feelings sometimes", "Agreed. Once you realize it was only a dream (usually when you wake up,) your response should be hugging them and being grateful it wasn\u2019t real. I had a similar dream a couple days ago. It seemed so real. When I woke up and saw him there I hugged him and told him about it. Of course we joked about it throughout the day. That\u2019s how normal relationships work.", "NTA. And her young age probably explains the immaturity. Maybe you should've sent her a 30 second max TikTok that explains your condition instead of expecting her to actually read a few articles. lol", "Yeah, sure have him offer an apology.\n\nThen when other people post about acquiescing to other people in their life like this, you and the other terminally online people can call them doormats.", "Can you still watch TV and movies?

There was no attempt at understanding which is why OP is firmly NTA - she was an asshole to him because she didn't take the time to try and understand what she might be walking into with OP going forward.", "yes but I often think that three different people with the same hair style are the same person, lol.  I have to go by voice.  But one cool thing is that I can identify pretty much any voice I've ever heard - the voice recognition part of my brain must have compensated.", "My dad's always had a full beard and mustache. One time, his barber made a mistake and had to shave him completely. I saw him walking up the driveway and had NO IDEA who he was.", "lol um yes. OP explained his medical diagnosis and even sent her articles and information about it so she\u2019d know what was going on she\u2019d be able to have an idea of how to react/what to do, but then she gets there and does that\u2026 \nso she either just ignored his messages and the information he sent her, or she just disregarded it. unless she has some sort of mental illness or something that takes her reaction out of her control, she is 100% an AH for her actions starting the moment she walked into OP\u2019s room for the visit", "My theory is I usually just say hi to people I think I know, and if I work out I don't, I get out of there and let them wrack their minds trying to recall me.

Because yep, that's me, pretty much every day, lol! I saw someone in the grocery store last week, and I knew that I knew her, but I couldn't place her. I started panicking as we started talking and she obviously knew me well; I finally realized that she is the receptionist at my dentist office, where I've been going for over 15 years! But yeah, if I see someone outside of their \"normal\" setting, all bets are off.", "Is it dogs. Because dead ass i feel like I can learn to tell dogs apart faster than humans.", "That\u2019s hilarious! \ud83d\ude1d", "My husband and I have entire conversations about our neighbors - some of whom are genuinely friends - this way.\n\n\"Spot's dad invited us to a block party this weekend.\"\n\nThe dog's name is alongside the human's name in my contacts.  Or it's just the dog's name if I never managed to learn / remember the human's name.", "God yes, that's everyone at the dog park. Every once in a while my neighbor who walks there will use a \"people name\" and I'm like \"right... people have names... who's the dog?\"\n\nThen again, I once had a very nice passing chat with someone from the dog park while we were at the grocery store. I still have no idea who she was without her dog."]}
