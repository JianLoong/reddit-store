Most of his family are decent people but his mom can be a little of a passive-aggressive and tends to criticize me a lot. Shaun sees it as \"her still not getting used to me being around\" but IDK because she treats his ex \"Julissa\" good. MIL says that Julissa has been around the family for age and her past with Shaun never affected her relationship with her. Fine, I never minded her attending every holiday and being around til yesterday.\n\n\nWe had Thanksgiving dinner at my MIL's house. Shaun went there before me and when I arrived it was already dinner time. Everyone was seated and I saw that all chairs were taken. I asked MIL why she didn't save me a seat and she said \"sorry\" and that one of her granddaughters decided to show up last minute and the chair was taken. I looked at her then at Julissa who was sitting next to shaun and tried to point out how I was more deserving of her chair since I'm the DIL (I know shouldn't have said it I know..I know) MIL flatout said that Julissa is as much FAMILY as me, and that it was rude to imply otherwise. Julissa was nodding confidently while glancing at me. I was so upset I wanted to leave but decided to just sit on my husband's lap and act as casual as possible. I sat on his lap asking if he was okay with it (don't worry I'm petite, he's strong built) and started eating so casually while smiling and complimenting the food and mentioning to Shaun how warm and comfortable his lap was now and then. The table went awkwardly silence. BIL would try to break the silence and change the subject but it somehow goes back to being awkward. MIL AND Julissa were barely eating and were staring at each other than at me eyes wide open.\n\n\nMinutes later, Julissa excused herself to the bathroom and so did MIL. It was still awkward but I did my best to focus on dinner. Shaun was eating as well. Later, there was just so much tension and MIL was barely able to speak after Julissa left (early, like right after dinner). Shaun and I went home and MIL tried calling but then called Shaun and texted me saying what I did was inappropriate and that I ruined Thanksgiving dinner and made it awkward. She said it wasn't her fault chairs were taken and I could've dragged a chair from the kitchen but acted childishly and made Julissa (and family) uncomfortable with how inappropriate I was.\n\n\nEDIT: I need to mention that even if I took a chair from the kitchen. There was not enough space at dinner table to fit the chair.

Your MIL was hosting, the primary goal of which being to ensure everyone's happy and comfortable. She did the opposite.\n\n2. Your husband's ex might be family, sure.

Perhaps MIL does things more casually, but everyone knew OP was coming and no one, including the husband, made sure a chair was waiting for her. No one jumped up to get her a chair when she arrived. MIL and the ex appeared to be in cahoots to embarrass OP. Husband passive and not supporting OP. But why did everyone start eating without OP in the first place?

She wanted to shame you and make you feel excluded, and you turned the tables on her. That annoyed her, but it doesn't make you TA. You need to make sure that your husband understands how not-ok this behaviour is. If he's got zero interest in Juilissa anymore, then honestly he should be offended that his mother keeps excluding his wife and trying to force him to get back together with his ex. This is a giant red flag from your MIL, and if your husband doesn't get this, it might be a marriage dealbreaker.", "NTA. She could have brought you another chair if she didn\u2019t like it.", "NTA, but the real move would have been for Shaun to give up his chair and stand awkwardly behind you. \n\nBet MIL would have figured it out and found space if he literally stood up for his wife. \n\nHelluva host your, MIL. I get the extra guest thing threw her off, but it isn't normal to set up a death match musical chairs to feed all your guests. Thank God no children or elderly people were the last to arrive. No. This was a calculated plan to make you uncomfortable. She's just mad cuz you flipped it on her.", "NTA. \n\n1. I am not petite and I would have still done the same thing.

Shame on your MIL for trying to pull such a stupid and pointless power play. Did she really think that inviting Julissa was going to make Shaun suddenly throw you over for her? If your husband had any manners or situational awareness, he would have already had a seat pulled in for you or offered you his. He must have had some idea that this set-up was going to create drama, but did nothing to avert it. That\u2019s pretty suspicious behavior, to me. \n\nGood for you for not backing down, OP. I\u2019d be having some serious conversations with Shaun after this, though. Why is he allowing your MIL to treat you like an outsider after all this time?

He should have gotten up from the table, texted you that Thanksgiving was cancelled, and met you at the door to take you home. \n\nHE is the one who should be protecting you from his mother and enforcing boundaries.

Also why is Julissa not aware of herself? \n\nNext time make MIL sit on the floor.", "You have a husband problem not a MIL problem.

That was a great way to deal with that passive aggressive family!", "NTA and that was an awesome response to the MIL's petty and calculated antics.  It was certainly not what she expected!\n\nYou didn't lose your crap over not having a chair so she can't complain about that.  Your MIL gave you lemons and you made lemonade.  You didn't let her pettiness give her a reaction that would've made you look bad.\n\nAnd you highlighted to Julissa that Shaun chose you and not her.  And you did it with finesse and complemented the food.\n\nMy guess is the only people that were upset about it were Julissa and your MIL.  Her grand daughter didn't just arrive out of the blue.  This was calculated and misfired badly... for your MIL.\n\nWhat did your husband say afterwards?", "Why is the Ex being invited to family gatherings??Even if they have kids which u didn\u2019t mention..", "Why was his ex there?

However, it was your MIL\u2019s responsibility as the hostess to ensure that you had a chair and to go get one for you as soon as you arrived if she somehow \u201cforgot\u201d you were coming. Your husband was also an AH for not offering you his seat when his mother made no attempt to correct the issue. Given your MILs rudeness, you were NOT the AH for sitting on your husband\u2019s lap.

It was still awkward but I did my best to focus on dinner. Shaun was eating as well. Later, there was just so much tension and MIL was barely able to speak after Julissa left (early, like right after dinner). Shaun and I went home and MIL tried calling but then called Shaun and texted me saying what I did was inappropriate and that I ruined Thanksgiving dinner and made it awkward.

Sitting by his ex when you don\u2019t have a seat?  Thinking that your mom making you feel less than his ex is ok?  Your AH MIL is right, you can\u2019t tell her how to treat people. But, when you see that you are being treated as less than you don\u2019t have to be subjected to the insulting, disrespectful behavior.

Him also not trying to pick sides is also him being in the wrong. When you move out your parents and siblings become less immediate and instead become extended, your spouse and possibly children are your immediate family. If you're not on the same side then you're not going to stay together. I have read enough JustNoMIL stories to sincerely say that if a spouse keeps siding with the MIL and not setting boundaries it is going to end in divorce and is the fault of the person who chose extended family over their own partner.\n\nAs for not knowing what the problem is between you two he's one of 3 things. He's ether wilfully ignorant and doing his best to stick his head in the sand and hide from issues, he's denser than iron and completely oblivious to how his mom acts about you or he's cheating on you with his ex seeing as he's ok with her being treated like she's his wife. MIL puts her next to him, she treats her better and she obviously wouldn't have left if you weren't romantically inclined with the man she wanted to be with. Normal people aren't ok dealing with someone they had romantic feelings with before that closely.

Why are you giving your husband a free pass in all this?", "Yeah, the \u201cmentioning every now and then that his lap was so warm and comfortable\u201d was what did it for me too.

Could you please move so she can sit next to me?\"  And when Julissa and MIL slunk off into the bathroom to commiserate about their manipulations not working in their favor, Shaun should have told them that Julissa is his ex for a reason, there is no hope for them to get back together, and unless and until Julissa and MIL learned to respect and accept his new relationship, they wouldn't be attending any more \"family\" gatherings.", "I have a little sympathy for the husband, if you grow up with batshit crazy, it screws up your sense of normal.

Because it is hard, we are more open to accepting excuses because it's easier to accept that possibility over the harder option. Some even make excuses for the family member. Others will go so far as to protect the family member. \nThis is a vicious cycle that can only be broken by a realization that the behaviour is inexcusable for anyone..

Or he will pat his leg and I\u2019ll sit on his leg to eat. But never has he made me feel excluded from his family. Granted his ex isn\u2019t ever at family get togethers but still. Heck, one time we were late to a family gathering, we told them to start without us, MIL miscounted chairs, my youngest niece said here sit with me, she got up, I sat down and she plopped herself in my lap, despite my FIL getting an extra chair. There were ways to accommodate OP\n\nNTA OP", "But again, how did these two manage to actually eat full meals with her in his lap? I can barely get a bite in with my 1 year old in my lap.", "This burn is so beautiful. *sniffle*", "Yes. She can outlive the MIL and be full of resentment, deal with the husband problem, or leave.", "Or even \"hey everyone start scooting your chairs, OP go get a chair from the kitchen,\" from literally anyone.", "This is the obvious correct answer. This whole weird situation was clearly planned by MIL and Julissa. I\u2019d usually be weirded out by an adult sitting on someone\u2019s lap during a meal, but I kind of have to give OP props for just throwing their stunt back in their faces. Husband needs to grow up and tell mommy to cut the nonsense.", "Don\u2019t even know how OPs husband allows his mother to invite his ex. Boundaries are a thing.", "The fact he didn't immediately offer his seat or defend his wife there makes me wonder if maybe Shaun is hopeful of that as well. I mean if that were me I'd have put an end to that shit asap. If his mom wants to remain friends with his ex so be it, but go out to lunch with her. You don't have her for Thanksgiving dinner.", "This is exactly what went through my mind. Especially since the MIL and ex disappeared to the bathroom together.", "This was my thought too. MIL loves the ex and is keeping her around sin the hope this marriage won't work out and she can slip right back in. It's fucked up and I can't imagine being treated so badly by in-laws and still agreeing to spend holidays with them. Give me a tv dinner and the house to myself any day!", "I think Shaun is loving the attention of three women. Nothing to complain about from his perspective ....", "And husband doesn\u2019t care enough about OP to set them straight. The man is straight up used to saying nothing at all in insane situations like no seat being put at the table for his wife, his wife sitting on his lap at the table. ESH. No dignity here at all - from any of them!", "Then husband needed to say that since there isn't room for us (meaning him and wife) we will fill our plates and take them home to eat. \n\nHe needs to call mom's bluff. He won't be set up with his ex at Thanksgiving and he will have Thanksgiving with his wife. If she isn't welcomed and accommodated with basics like a plate and a chair then he will leave with her.", "THIS!!! I think it was very uncool of him to not ensure she had a seat at the table.", "Or he was told where to seat by MIL", "When they go low, take that shit to the floor.", "As the child raised in a situation like this, not only did Grandma not like my Mom, she didn\u2019t like us either! We got no Christmas gifts or birthday gifts. Cousins got everything! My brother didn\u2019t even go to Grandma\u2019s funeral.", "I\u2019m really trying to wrap my head around why the husband didn\u2019t say, \u201cokay, there\u2019s not enough room here. Wife, let\u2019s me and you eat in the kitchen/living room to save everyone space.\u201d This whole thing just seems like a setup that the husband was either in on or was perfectly happy to watch unfold. \n\nESH, all around. How awful to have to watch this train wreck ruin the best dinner all year.", "To Go with my \"Its a floor wax AND a dessert topping!\" .\n\nA whole product line!", "Yep. A good host would *never, ever* just sit there and tell a guest \"oops, no seat for you!\"", "It is. So hopefully it was memorable enough that MIL will remember how badly her little stunt backfired and won\u2019t pull shit like this again.", "It could also be that MIL just genuinely likes Julissa. Maybe they were high school sweethearts or even childhood friends and she was around the family for a long time. It's weird that she seems to favor her though. It sounds like she doesn't really like OP. \n\nMy friend cheated on her husband but her parents still considered him family and hung out with him after they divorced lol. Her dad told me, \"Well he didn't do anything wrong!\"", "I think if hubby did this AND defended OP this would've been the case. But as it happened, he just sat there silent in the midst of all of the tension?  Why didn't he he ask his mom where OP was supposed to sit before she arrived? The whole thing could've been avoided if hubby had spoken up and prevented this mess."]}
