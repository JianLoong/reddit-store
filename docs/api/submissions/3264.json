Most of his family are decent people but his mom can be a little of a passive-aggressive and tends to criticize me a lot. Shaun sees it as \"her still not getting used to me being around\" but IDK because she treats his ex \"Julissa\" good. MIL says that Julissa has been around the family for age and her past with Shaun never affected her relationship with her. Fine, I never minded her attending every holiday and being around til yesterday.\n\n\nWe had Thanksgiving dinner at my MIL's house. Shaun went there before me and when I arrived it was already dinner time. Everyone was seated and I saw that all chairs were taken. I asked MIL why she didn't save me a seat and she said \"sorry\" and that one of her granddaughters decided to show up last minute and the chair was taken. I looked at her then at Julissa who was sitting next to shaun and tried to point out how I was more deserving of her chair since I'm the DIL (I know shouldn't have said it I know..I know) MIL flatout said that Julissa is as much FAMILY as me, and that it was rude to imply otherwise. Julissa was nodding confidently while glancing at me. I was so upset I wanted to leave but decided to just sit on my husband's lap and act as casual as possible. I sat on his lap asking if he was okay with it (don't worry I'm petite, he's strong built) and started eating so casually while smiling and complimenting the food and mentioning to Shaun how warm and comfortable his lap was now and then. The table went awkwardly silence. BIL would try to break the silence and change the subject but it somehow goes back to being awkward. MIL AND Julissa were barely eating and were staring at each other than at me eyes wide open.\n\n\nMinutes later, Julissa excused herself to the bathroom and so did MIL. It was still awkward but I did my best to focus on dinner. Shaun was eating as well. Later, there was just so much tension and MIL was barely able to speak after Julissa left (early, like right after dinner). Shaun and I went home and MIL tried calling but then called Shaun and texted me saying what I did was inappropriate and that I ruined Thanksgiving dinner and made it awkward. She said it wasn't her fault chairs were taken and I could've dragged a chair from the kitchen but acted childishly and made Juilissa (and family) uncomfortable with how inappropriate I was.\n\n\nEDIT: I need to mention that even if I took a chair from the kitchen. There was not enough space at dinner table to fit the chair. Everyone was sitting bext to each other.", "created_utc": 1669462995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z55m2b/aita_for_sitting_on_my_husbands_lap_during/", "score": 333, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your MIL was hosting, the primary goal of which being to ensure everyone's happy and comfortable. She did the opposite.\n\n2. Your husband's ex might be family, sure.

Sometimes, you have to do what you can to remind the family that you\u2019re your husband\u2019s partner, not his ex. Is it the equivalent of pissing on something to mark your territory?

Perhaps MIL does things more casually, but everyone knew OP was coming and no one, including the husband, made sure a chair was waiting for her. No one jumped up to get her a chair when she arrived. MIL and the ex appeared to be in cahoots to embarrass OP. Husband passive and not supporting OP. But why did everyone start eating without OP in the first place?

She wanted to shame you and make you feel excluded, and you turned the tables on her. That annoyed her, but it doesn't make you TA. You need to make sure that your husband understands how not-ok this behaviour is. If he's got zero interest in Juilissa anymore, then honestly he should be offended that his mother keeps excluding his wife and trying to force him to get back together with his ex. This is a giant red flag from your MIL, and if your husband doesn't get this, it might be a marriage dealbreaker.", "NTA. She could have brought you another chair if she didn\u2019t like it.", "NTA, but the real move would have been for Shaun to give up his chair and stand awkwardly behind you. \n\nBet MIL would have figured it out and found space if he literally stood up for his wife. \n\nHelluva host your, MIL. I get the extra guest thing threw her off, but it isn't normal to set up a death match musical chairs to feed all your guests. Thank God no children or elderly people were the last to arrive.

He must have had some idea that this set-up was going to create drama, but did nothing to avert it. That\u2019s pretty suspicious behavior, to me. \n\nGood for you for not backing down, OP.

It was certainly not what she expected!\n\nYou didn't lose your crap over not having a chair so she can't complain about that.  Your MIL gave you lemons and you made lemonade.  You didn't let her pettiness give her a reaction that would've made you look bad.\n\nAnd you highlighted to Julissa that Shaun chose you and not her.  And you did it with finesse and complemented the food.\n\nMy guess is the only people that were upset about it were Julissa and your MIL.  Her grand daughter didn't just arrive out of the blue.

He should\u2019ve saved to seat next to him for you or given you his seat.", "Then the husband should have gotten up and offered his seat. Or they could have left if there was no room and felt disrespected. Why make everyone else have to deal with that uncomfortable situation? And she was sitting there making comments about how his lap was warm and soft, so let\u2019s not pretend she was doing it in all innocence just to have a place to sit. Look, I do t care about the MIL or ex, but if I had been a 3rd party person at an uncomfortable table at Thanksgiving, I would have been pissed.", "logic could be: \n\nOP suggest MIL purposly was a chair short. Granddaugher was the unexpexted arrival. in order for their to be a chair short and it to be planned GD would be in on it, depending on timeline. Or it reads as a just refuse GD into coming bevause not that much space.\ncould be that, could be she mixed up ex and GD. \n\n\n\nAlso in the situation, as GD who arrived unexpected, i would have left rather then deal with the \"oh so warm amd comfy\"", "Good on ya.\n\nEdit: lack of sleep brings lack of comprehension lol\n\nI understand your meaning now.", "If they were unwilling to get her a chair in the first place I can\u2019t see the whole table going out of their way to then make room for her", "You\u2019re not wrong but here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s already working bc either OP\u2019s husband is too stupid to see what\u2019s going on (which means he can\u2019t be trusted to be alone while they fill his head bc he\u2019s too stupid) or it\u2019s already worked bc he just sat there like an idiot and let all this happen. HE was the first point of defense for OP and he fell asleep at his post- or he went MIA on purpose. \n\nI have my suspicions.", "yes, if you sit on someones lap, you take space. you can't if there is none. if you sit legs on the side, you take space there. legs in front, now there is a litt off space between him and the table, and you block his view off it too. \n\nthe oh and ah ing where meant to make everyone uncomfortable. And the rest of the guest are bystanders."]}
