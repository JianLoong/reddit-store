Im on a great program that has helped me lose 10 pounds since the new year. It has done a 180 to my eating habits I feel so much better on a daily basis with more energy. \n\nNow the issue. Friday, my mom invited myself and siblings for dinner. I asked ahead of time for the menu so I knew what I could eat and if I needed to bring something else to keep to my diet. My mom said oh no worries they are cutting back too and it's a healthy meal. (Side note she does know my diet as we have discussed it low carb high protein lean meat no sugar.) Okay I trust her. Well the dinner comes and mom serves a salad first. Okay fine I picked out the croutons doing great so far. The main meal is porkchops cooked in a ready gravy, so packed with sugars and carbs with potatoes, and rolls with cake and ice cream for dessert. I'm looking and cant eat any of this. Mom sees me just eating more salad and asks why I'm not eating the food she spent hours making. I said you know I'm diabetic now with high blood pressure. I can't eat any of this you told me you guys were watching your diet too. She goes \"well we're all together for a meal I thought that was a good reason to celebrate and cheat a little. It's not like one meal will kill you.\" I said \"this is exactly why I asked for the menu ahead of time so I could plan. I said this was very disrespectful to do this when she's knows how hard I am trying to save my own life! I'm only 30 and on diabetic medication and blood pressure meds and how does she not understand how serious this and has the gall to guilt me into eating?\" My grandma chimes in that diets don't work forever and I'll never stick to it forever so I should just enjoy this meal my mother was kind enough to make everyone and say thank you. I said \"no this very serious and my family should be supporting me for trying so hard.\" My grandma called me spoiled and my mom said I was ungrateful for all her effort to make a nice meal. My siblings were on my side saying they want their sister alive and my brother said it was no different then trying to force feed someone food they are allergic to and then getting upset they won't give themselves a reaction by eating it. My mom and grandma continued to tell me how awful I was for not eating so I left.\n\nI have since gotten a  text from my mom and dad reinforcing how ungrateful I am and in the future if I make food they won't eat it so I can see how it feels.

You stated what your diet was and she misled you. It is important to stick to it in order to get healthy enough to get off those meds.

Good on you for taking care of you, and good on your siblings for supporting you.  My advice - don't bother answering them, and don't feel bad. You aren't ungrateful or immature - they are projecting their own failures.", "NTA-your mom and gma are being psychologically abusive. If this is indicative of normal interactions with them, then you need to consider whether or not it is healthy to be around them. Whether or not you\u2019ve considered it, some of your issues with eating, body image, depression etc could be related to these types of abuses.

You\u2019re trying to take care of your health, under medical guidance, and your family should be supporting your efforts, not sabotaging them. \n\nIt sounds like your mom equates food with love, and this has probably been true your whole life. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s where you learned to eat your feelings in the first place. You\u2019re trying to break the cycle and build healthier habits. Any time a person is trying to break bad family habits like this, there will be major pushback from the family. Hopefully your mom will come around when she sees you sticking to it and sees it working. In the meantime you\u2019ll have to work to stay strong against her pushback.

Wow they don't get it. Adhering to any type of restrictive diet is a chore. This isn't some whim or fad. You are doing it for your health. They dismissed that. \n\nI hope that they come around. I also wish you success on your new eating habits, and that your medical issues are able to be controlled. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nYou ate what you could, but your mom purposely ignored your dietary needs. She was the one who wasted food - if she and your dad didn't eat it!\n\nGo low contact with your mom, dad, and grandma for a while. You don't need their bad attitude regarding your diet. You might want to seek some counseling to help you deal with them in the future. I wish you the best with your weight-loss efforts.", "Nope, NTA", "NTA they\u2019re trying to sabotage you keep a close eye on it and stick to it you need to do. At least you have the support of your siblings and they know better.", "Your parents and grandma suck! You\u2019re absolutely NTA. Their views are severely outdated in that you should eat what your served, even if it\u2019s not healthy for you. Then to guilt and gaslight you into thinking that you\u2019re in the wrong is even worse, especially since you asked for the menu ahead of time! Your mom is the biggest asshole here in completely trying to ruin your diet and your health over her own selfishness!", "NTA\n\nYour parents should be supporting you. I'm on a similar diet and if my mom makes something I know I shouldn't have, I go out and get food I can eat. She does get hurt but understands. Good luck with your changes and don't let what your parents and grandmother stop you and I hope you and your siblings can have a nice meal that everyone can enjoy.", "NTA - I'll be honest with you. They are attempting to sabotage you. I'm guessing your family deals with weight issues and they feel insecure with you bettering yourself. \n\nI would stop going over there for a long while. If/when you decide your ol with going back, don't do so without first preparing your own food that your ok with disposing at a moments notice as they will try and put something into it. \n\nI would also thank your siblings for standing up for you :-)\n\nIf you do want to respond to your parents, ask them why they were so afraid to tell you what was for dinner and why you not eating hurt their feelings so much.

Just for a little while let them understand you mean what you are doing and don't let them guilt trip you.", "NTA.  Your parents' and grandmother's reaction was extreme denial!

I struggle with weight issues, too, so I know how hard every one of those pounds was to lose.  Keep it up!", "NTA Tell them they're behaving either really ignorantly or really selfishly to be putting their preferences over your health.", "Yes, you are correct. Mom is a bigger person herself and grandma eh maybe a little bit.", "Thank you! My sister has already told me she wants to have just us siblings over for dinner in a couple weeks and she said she has zero problem working with me and would actually love some help making a meal together. She is such a wonderful soul and said she wants ideas for her own family to eat better.", "Yes, you are correct. I asked ahead so I could plan my own food if I needed to. I didn't expect anyone to cater to my needs. I just wanted a heads up. You are also correct again. When I couldn't eat anything I decided to stick with salad. Thanks for the advice too. I really do love my parents. They are stubborn and I doubt liked me talking back as they still want to believe I'm 15 without an opinion. I'm hoping this is just a hiccup and we can work this out.", "Thank you! And yes you are very spot on. Food in my family is love. Got a good grade on a test? Special dessert with dinner. Got into your 1st choice college? Everyone goes out to dinner to celebrate. Feeling sick, had a bad day, etc? Here's some food. I'm realizing as an adult that while the intentions were good this really caused a bad relationship with food for all of us.", "Maybe stay away from your parents and grandma for a while. They aren\u2019t on your side and they don\u2019t understand or care what position they put you in. \n\nI can hardly comprehend the amount of parents on this sub who sabotage their children\u2019s health by intentionally feeding/sneaking ingredients that will harm them. \n\nThese parents need psychological help. It\u2019s not your fault. Protect yourself! NTA", "Yes! Starve your parents and your grandmother of their power to be nasty to you. \"Increase the price of admission to your presence\" as they say. If they can't control your relationships, traditions, and communication they don't hold much chance of ruining it for you. Require that they be respectful and if they can't do that they need to be silent on the subject.", "Mom and grandma might understand diet as \"temporary measure to lose weight, then resume normal diet to only gain the weight back. Also known as yoyo dieting\" while OP's diet is a \"lifestyle change\". Two very different things. Yoyo diet can have \"cheat/reward days\" while lifestyle changes do not have that flexibility.", "I just wanna say congrats on keeping yourself healthy so you can live your best possible life. Your mom and grandmother have to be upset you can lose weight or just dont care about your health because they sound fucking stupid trying to make you eat food that isn\u2019t going to do you any good", "NTA. I would suggest your forgo family dinners from now on. This is like she was trying to sabotage you. You should have said \u2018Sure it looks great, but (big but) I\u2019m making better decisions with what I eat now\u2019. I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re not understanding of you. And it\u2019s hard to start a diet and keep to it, thanks Grandma. It\u2019s like an alcoholic, \u2018one drink\u2019 is never just one. It\u2019s how you fall off that wagon. All it takes is just \u2018one\u2019 meal for you to go back to shitty eating habits. Good on you for sticking to your diet and walking away!", "NTA. People will insist it's a \"special occasion\" or they \"won't tell\" all the time. The \"it's only us\" mentality displayed here. The problem: it's *always* \"only us\". \n\nYour friends will want you to come out and cheat at your diet. Your family will get together, it's \"special\" and effort was taken and you should eat. Random people will feel the need to interject because they don't think your diet is what you need.\n\nThe truth is that you are the only person who is solely looking out for you. Only *you* can make the changes you need. You're doing everything right, your diet is professionally led and supportive of your health needs. \n\nIt's time to build boundaries. If your mother can't fulfill the basic request of telling you what she's cooking (you didn't even ask her to accommodate you!) then don't be around her at mealtimes. Leave if she insists on trying to force food on you. She will either learn, or she will do or say something that proves that she doesn't want you to improve. Same goes for anyone else who sabotages you.\n\nGood luck with your health plan!", "NTA  I doubt your mom can even articulate to herself why she feels so threatened by your dietary changes.  If she eats like that all the time she is likely overweight herself and your rejecting they way she feeds you feels like a rejection of her and a refutation of how she raised you.  I wouldn't cut her out of my life or anything like that because I wouldn't want to tell her that yes, I am rejecting you.  I'd continue to visit but never schedule it around meal times. I'd also cook for her once just to let her get it out of her system if she wants to reject it.   But then I always feel doing things like that puts me in control of the situation.   Just make it something you can save to eat later.  It's hard to make the lifestyle changes you are making and I wish you the best of luck.", "You could literally die and they don't care? I'm so sorry about the elders in your family, but this may be a psychological thing as their unhealthy eating is staring them right in the face. Reality sucks for some people when they don't accept it but keep repeating that this could kill you over and over until they get it.
