After a few minutes of trying to explain that a survey is absolutely the way to determine where your fence should be, she threw her hands up and said \u2018my contractor has my survey\u2019 and walked back in the house.  \n\nThe next week, the contractor continued to finish the fence without moving anything.  We emailed her and called her and she ghosted us.  I paid $900 to have a surveyor do a site visit and write a report that clearly showed the fence was on our property.

Your neighbor is a thief; she attempted to simply take your property. You own that property, you paid for it and you need it.  She is lucky you haven't sued her to recover the cost of the additional survey.", "NTA. She wanted more space and was just going to take it.  She should pay for damage to your property, new survey, and your attorney. Good for you for following through and not letting her take advantage of you.", "NTA.\n\nWhen the neighbor pays your mortgage and taxes with the deed in their name, they can put the fence on your property.  Until then, building anything on property they don't own is theft and trespassing.", "NTA, neighbor is the asshole.\n\nThis is crazy. You gave a **nice warning** back when it would have been easy to fix, but you neighbor didn't want to hear it. That's on them.", "NTA - you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes. She created this mess by trying to encroach onto your property and not working with you reasonably. Your neighbors may eventually come around if they get to know you. Nothing you can do there, let things play out for now.", "NTA.  I've had so many friends who didn't deal with this until it was far too late and then became a huge issue about easement and ended up in court.", "NTA\n\nHow could you be? You tried to be polite about her stealing your land and she ghosted you. Your only recourse at that point was to get the courts involved. Even then, you were polite about it and she kept trying to fight something that I'm sure her lawyer told her was an unwinnable case. I'd print up a flyer that states exactly what happened and how you hope everyone will see that you were not bullying anyone and that you just needed the property you paid for.", "NTA.\n\nThis is one reason why I'm so glad I live out in the boonies. There's no fighting with other people about property lines. Everyone has plenty of space, and the only invasions of that space you have to worry about are squirrels or rabbits (every now and then, a deer or a fox. Once there was an opossum). None of them will badmouth you to your neighbors, either.", "NTA. Your neighbor was trying to steal your property, probably by adverse possession. I second the advice to talk to an attorney about suing for costs and inconvenience", "NTA\n\nBut, trow your hands up, shake it all around and have a party when your lawyer sends her the bills for survey and what not...", "NTA. let your character speak for itself. don\u2019t worry about her cruel words, your actions are louder.", "NTA and you tried to let her know before the fence was fully built. Maybe she thought her bluster would get her a larger yard.", "NTA, similar situation happened to us. Neighbors moved their existing shed onto our property, leaving it very close to our patio. My husband politely asked them to move it back 5 ft  on their side of the line. Nastiness ensued, they got cited and had to move it. Trash talked us to other neighbors, put their garbage behind the shed so we had to look at it until we built a fence etc. It\u2019s been 27 yrs and now we just ignore each other \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "NTA, if you let her leave it, she may be able to claim it's her property in the future.  I ran into this when buying a house, but it worked in my favor because their fence was too far inset, and they gave me the extra property because they didn't want to move their fence.  Was almost a full acre due to the property size in the country.\n\nIn another instance, I had a neighbor just plant a garden and turn our lot into a personal parking lot.  I didn't need it, but my other neighbor bought it from me and put up a fence to keep them out.", "NTA you did everything the right way in my opinion", "NTA\n\nShe tried to steal your land", "NTA you did nothing wrong.  Don\u2019t worry about her talking who really cares what this person thinks", "This is probably the really wrong response, but I would\u2019ve knocked the fence down", "NTA. But depending on the encroachment amount, I might've made them an offer to let them leave the fencing where it was...obviously only if it didn't get in the way of your use/future plans, and only if it would be financially beneficial for you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do not worry because over time people tend to figure the smear campaigners out and avoid them.  Just be patient.", "NTA. She sucks tho", "You don\u2019t have to justify why it matters to you that the fence be moved. It was on your property and that\u2019s enough.\n\nNTA", "NTA and nicer than me. I would have personally ripped down the fence after it was installed. Items installed on my property without my permission become mine to do with as I wish.", "Not sure why you didn\u2019t talk with the contractor about where he was put the fence instead of letting him finish building the fence on your property?", "She had it coming, she literally tried to steal your property.\n\nNTA.", "You paid $900 for someone to come locate your property pins? You got ripped off real bad.\n\nYou should have taken her to small claims and recovered your money.", "NTA- but I\u2019d love to know how far on to the property it went", "Well... if she told your other neighbors that you were stealing her land, how does she explain the fence being moved back?", "NTA tell the neighbors to watch out for her since she tried to take some of your property.", "OP should definitely try to recoup legal fees and survey costs.  Have the lawyer send another letter, this time containing an itimized bill. He alerted her before the fence was fully installed.  Her arrogance should cost her.", "Exactly. If OP had not pushed back then after a few years legally the neighbor could claim ownership of that land. It could cause problems if and when OP tried to sell the house, as many people would be very reluctant to buy a house where there could be a legal issue unresolved.", "My closest neighbor is 1/2 to 1 mile away. LOVE IT!!", "Was hoping someone would bring up adverse possession.", "It was measured by the surveyor at 12 inches over the property line into our yard. I also didn\u2019t include in my original post that this fence ate into 3 other neighbors yards at the same amount.. wanted to keep this relevant to my own case. But thought it might be interesting for you to know", "Believe me, I attempted to for that reason, and he verbally (and almost physically) abused me on my own property, getting in my face and telling me I \u201cdon\u2019t know what I\u2019m fu**ing talking about.\u201d I ended up walking away so it didn\u2019t escalate further.", "This is definitely not the way to go if OP likes having any other neighbors. If people already believe the bullying story, it\u2019ll only get worse when the neighbor says \u201cand then OP sued me,\u201d which would actually be true and lends credibility to the original (wrong) narrative", "Funny you mention this, the neighbor in question is actually a licensed realtor and thus should conceivably be aware of easement regulations/consequences\u2026", "Yea...\n\n1. This person is an asshole and doing sloppy household work. I can't imagine they're a great neighbor generally and/or they are using crappy contractors who are liable for disregarding property lines.\n2. It depends what that foot  of space is worth to you. Personally (based on the size of our yard), I'd approach them with an offer to leave the fence in place for several thousand (or tens of thousands of) dollars, they could have the property line redrawn to include the newly claimed property...depends on your area, but you have to factor in the value of that lot size over time. If they balked at the offer, I'd force them to move the fence and not remotely care how they feel about it.", "I would have called the police and had him arrested for trespassing. \n\nAlthough, these days the police would have probably told you it\u2019s a civil matter and driven away.", "Good feedback. Thanks for your suggestions on alternate options. The situation is resolved now but appreciate different perspective"]}
