Your neighbor is a thief; she attempted to simply take your property. You own that property, you paid for it and you need it.  She is lucky you haven't sued her to recover the cost of the additional survey.", "NTA. She wanted more space and was just going to take it.  She should pay for damage to your property, new survey, and your attorney. Good for you for following through and not letting her take advantage of you.", "NTA.\n\nWhen the neighbor pays your mortgage and taxes with the deed in their name, they can put the fence on your property.  Until then, building anything on property they don't own is theft and trespassing.", "NTA, neighbor is the asshole.\n\nThis is crazy. You gave a **nice warning** back when it would have been easy to fix, but you neighbor didn't want to hear it. That's on them.", "NTA - you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes.

I've had so many friends who didn't deal with this until it was far too late and then became a huge issue about easement and ended up in court.", "NTA\n\nHow could you be? You tried to be polite about her stealing your land and she ghosted you. Your only recourse at that point was to get the courts involved. Even then, you were polite about it and she kept trying to fight something that I'm sure her lawyer told her was an unwinnable case. I'd print up a flyer that states exactly what happened and how you hope everyone will see that you were not bullying anyone and that you just needed the property you paid for.", "NTA.\n\nThis is one reason why I'm so glad I live out in the boonies. There's no fighting with other people about property lines. Everyone has plenty of space, and the only invasions of that space you have to worry about are squirrels or rabbits (every now and then, a deer or a fox. Once there was an opossum).

Maybe she thought her bluster would get her a larger yard.", "NTA, similar situation happened to us. Neighbors moved their existing shed onto our property, leaving it very close to our patio. My husband politely asked them to move it back 5 ft  on their side of the line. Nastiness ensued, they got cited and had to move it.

I ran into this when buying a house, but it worked in my favor because their fence was too far inset, and they gave me the extra property because they didn't want to move their fence.  Was almost a full acre due to the property size in the country.\n\nIn another instance, I had a neighbor just plant a garden and turn our lot into a personal parking lot.  I didn't need it, but my other neighbor bought it from me and put up a fence to keep them out.", "NTA you did everything the right way in my opinion", "NTA\n\nShe tried to steal your land", "NTA you did nothing wrong.

I can't imagine they're a great neighbor generally and/or they are using crappy contractors who are liable for disregarding property lines.\n2. It depends what that foot  of space is worth to you. Personally (based on the size of our yard), I'd approach them with an offer to leave the fence in place for several thousand (or tens of thousands of) dollars, they could have the property line redrawn to include the newly claimed property...depends on your area, but you have to factor in the value of that lot size over time.

As you drove along the access road, you passed the first lot, which was a refrigerated warehouse.  It was still being completed, but was close to finished.\n\nThe second lot was where I was going.  It was a large multinational company - you'd know the name.  \n\nThis site had been finished about a year and was in full operation.  \n\nAfter being on site for several days, I was told this story...\n\nThe company put up a free-standing sign at the entrance to their parking/property.\n\nThe sign was simply their logo, as it's recognized worldwide, but illuminated and about 1 story tall - this was because the sign took advantage of the fact that this property was adjacent to the state turnpike... therefore, the sign was visible from the turnpike - a benefit of the location.\n\nThe sign was over $70K and it cost another $22K to install it (needed substantial foundation piers and electrical).\n\nThe refrigerated warehouse put their parking lot and curbs in, added landscaping and then ran 12' high fencing along the property.\n\nWhen the fence was installed, the very expensive sign was fenced in on the warehouse company's side.  The multinational freaked out and demanded the fence be moved.\n\nThe warehouse people just pointed to the survey and said \"actually, about that.... your sign is on our property...\"", "NTA at all - in fact if you wanted to you could take her to small claims court to recoup your survey cost. Or you could just tell her this next time she starts in on you. You can be the nice one here and let that part go but make sure she knows you have more options if she doesn\u2019t leave you alone and continue to slander you.\n\nAny reasonable neighbor would\u2019ve immediately went back to the contractor to question it - after all, the burden of cost isn\u2019t even on her to move the fence - it\u2019s 100% her contractor\u2019s fault for not following the line.", "NTA and zero sympathy for someone who willingly ignores truth. Her intent was to wear you down and gain free property through nefarious means. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn\u2019t worry about neighbors and their opinions, my only thought about my neighbors is that if they don\u2019t steal my land or be a pain in the ass, they\u2019re awesome.", "NTA. \n\nYou should also sue for the survey and lawyer fees.", "well if it's on your property can't you just tear it down? or better yet, draw dicks all over it", "Nope, NTA.

She quite literally disrespected your boundaries.", "You would have been within your rights to tear the fence down and trash it.", "NTA. She would have claim to that land if you left it. You were nice and tried to get her to move it prior to job completion.  I\u2019m petty and would have just put up a new fence along the real property line or taken her fence apart.  But that seems more of a headache than you want", "NTA. She caused this problem, and you absolutely *had* to resolve it for legal reasons.

Tell all her sympathizing neighbors they can be the ones to donate her land", "N remotely TA. F her. One lesson I've learned living in a newish neighborhood for 5 years and hanging out fairly often with my neighbors is that they are NEIGHBORS, NOT FAMILY OR FRIENDS. Who gives a S%#T what she tells people or what they think. She has no right to encroach on your property. In some states if you didn't force her to move the fence, she could claim your land as hers if she's maintaining it for a period of time. I had this situation with a house I once owned as I basically owned my neighbors front yard (his house was behind mine).  Fortunately he was really cool about it but if he wasn't it could definitely have been an issue. You HAD to take action in my eyes and if she doesn't like it she can kiss your a$$.", "NTA - a whole foot is too much.  my fences with my neighbors cross into each others' yards but it's like an inch at worst.", "NTA. Any chance you get, tell people about it. It'll spread that you're not a tyrant. Also who cares if they think you are- cool! They won't mess with you. Honestly I think you should just let it blow over and say oh well.", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for yourself. I bet she was counting on you just backing down.

Your neighbor should've have stopped as soon as you told her you had questions about the lot lines and had the posts moved per your survey stakes.  You tried to tell her and she didn't want to hear it.  F around and find out, I guess.  OP, you did exactly what you had a right to do and that was not cede any of your lot to your neighbor!  Can you imagine if you went to sell your house 5 yrs down the road and discovered the fence was off?", "Wouldn't the contractor be liable for moving the fence to the correct position on the the neighbors property?", "NTA. You don\u2019t need any other reason other than it\u2019s your property. End of story.", "NTA, at all. Property is property, and I would fight it too.", "NTA- And you need to defend yourself against her slander, libel, and defamation. Sit down at your computer, and start with an apology for distributing the paper, but she is slandering, libeling, and defaming you and your family and you need to set the record straight. Write the same thing you did here, with a direct timeline where you made her aware she built the fence on your property, she ignored you and was nasty about it, etc., all of it, right up to having to get your attorney involved because she refused to speak to you. Once you do that, print a copy to distribute to every homeowner in the neighborhood. Speak to your attorney again, Jae them look over your letter (to ensure you don\u2019t libel her), and have them draft a cease and desist letter and send it to her. Then go around the neighborhood and ring doorbells and give those letters out, maybe with some homemade cookies (don\u2019t put nuts in them, some folks may be allergic), and apologize for taking their time but that her actions necessitated you set the record straight, and since you don\u2019t know how many folks she has lied to about you you were visiting everyone (and bringing cookies!).", "Just curious... when you put up a fence how far onto your property should you it???\n\nOur fence is on the line because it is a shared project\n\nYou of course are not the AH.

This is why any homeowner before installing a fence needs to get a survey of the property done.", "Here, the neighbor can't put a fence on the property line without the written approval of the owners of the other property.

The day my neighbor had the foundation dug and poured he got a call from the county saying they had removed that requirement and he could build out if he wanted. Since it would have cost several thousands of dollars, plus how do you get rid of the old foundation (?) he chose to keep the wall with the setback. I would clear weeds up to his wall just because it made my unwalled yard look bad but he did get into a spat with neighbors on the other side when they tried to attach their wall to his believing his was on the property line.  They were good neighbors and I missed them when they moved to be closer to adult children.", "I thought the same thing. In most states the contractor must obtain permits to install or replace an existing fence. He should be ultimately responsible for the installation.

Had they sat silent, the neighbor could wind up owning the extra land after awhile.", "many places only require a fence permit when pools are involved, otherwise you're on your own.", "I was facing a similar situation and I spoke to city hall first.  I was advised that if a fence was placed on my property I should have a notice sent to them by my lawyer that if the fence wasn't moved off my property by I certain date that I would assume the fence as my property and do with as I wish.  \n\nHe said if it ever went to court this was the way to go, if I had just cut it down I would have to hope I got a judge that saw things the way I did.", "I agree in principle but OP doesn\u2019t own the materials and would be opening themselves up to a lawsuit", "Who owns the moonshine still, and who grows the Mary Jane? Hypothetically, of course...", "How do you trick or treat?!", "Yea I guess if the yards are small that would be an issue..  hopefully the fence looks nice", "When I had my fence replaced, we had to send in schematics for the fence- since we were replacing existing fence we didn\u2019t need an assessment but it was necessary to pull a permit. Either the contractor or the homeowner would have needed to get it and post it.\n\nIf the contractor was that combative I\u2019d put money on him being unlicensed.", "Have you told the other neighbors?  They should know and can join you in suing her.", "Can you estimate the square feet of the property she was trying to steal by the length of the fence that encroached in all four properties.  Not important but would give us an idea of what she was up to.  1foot  over the line doesn't sound as important as 100 Sq feet.", "I would be willing to let it go if she would act neighborly, but let\u2019s look at what we know here - she needs to be spanked in court on this one. Any reasonable neighbor would\u2019ve had the contractor check their work. When it\u2019s all said and done, the burden of cost to move the fence would\u2019ve been the contractor\u2019s since they did the work incorrectly. But the neighbor had to be a total idiot and cause OP to spend $900 at a minimum to defend himself. She\u2019s the bully, not him. Time to teach her a lesson.", "How can anyone believe the bullying story if she had to have the contractor move the fence.", "Yeah, but if the neighbors believe the story to begin with they're not worth courting. Besides, how does losing a lawsuit prove that the plaintiff was in the wrong all along?", "So what?", "Respectfully disagree. She needs to be shown the correct way to do things.", "He would not have successfully sued her if he was in the wrong, so suing her proved that he is in the right. Allowing property theft is never right.", "You also make it very clear a defamation suit will follow if she continues to lie about the incident.", "Are you joking? This is just horrible advice.", "You sound like a door mat", "I would send a letter to all the neighbors with copy of the survey and other info and calling out her lies", "The narrative may not be wrong. We don\u2019t know what was actually said. I also wonder how far over the property line the fence was.", "That may be true if the truth wasn\u2019t on his side.. he can also go after her for defamation, and make her apologize and fix what she did publicly.. personally, I think that\u2019s more important than anything else, get the survey money, back, lawyer fees, and make her do a public apology.", "Yeah, I was a zoning officer in NJ, and our town policy was that if something encroached on someone else's property, as long as the person who put it there removed it within the set time period on the citation (usually 30 days, 90 days if it was extensive) the fines were wiped. I'd keep a note in the file this happened, but municipalities are not making bank with zoning fines and zoning officers don't want to work unpaid overtime going to court for BS (perhaps that was just me)", "The property was theirs, and the neighbour knew that, so their neighbour gifted them a fence they didn't want.  The contractor would have to cut it out so you'd likely not be liable for removing the gift yourself.", "Possession is 9/10ths of the law.", "How far onto your property was her \u201cmistake\u201d? I\u2019m dying to know exactly what kind of property heist she was trying to pull \u2026..\n\nShe may have stupidly been hoping *you*  would be dumb, would believe her, she then waits however long then tries to claim adverse possession\u2026. \n\nHow ridiculous! \n\nNTA of course", "You would think, but common sense isn't common. Personally for me, realtors, especially successful ones, tend to be arrogant and entitled. Sounds like exactly who you're dealing with. Good on you for standing up to this bully. \ud83c\udf7b", "That makes it even worse and I didn\u2019t think that was possible. I\u2019d definitely consider legal action.", "Realtors are a step above cashiers, just paid ridiculous money for sitting on their ass. There's no intelligence required.", "We're not that cool with them. They got shitty with us over the noise impacting their airbnb (aka the shed) when my Dad was brushcutting (during the day, no noise regulation violation) to clear a fire zone around our house.", "It's a pain in the ass, that's for sure", "Legally, it may have been a civil matter, but the neighbour and contractor turned it into a rather uncivil matter.", "Not before shooting his dog, though.", "We recently had a concrete fence installed. It was replacing a rather dilapidated wooden fence that didn\u2019t fare well in the Arizona sun. Because we kept the new fence the same height there were no permit requirements in our unincorporated part of the county. However, because it is a concrete fence it obviously cost more than $1000. We had a county inspector at the yard to verify our solar installation and he commented about the fence and the 16\u2019 gate. He tried to insist that we should have pulled permits and at one point said he was going to note it on the property records. If he does we\u2019ll appeal on the grounds that this fence doesn\u2019t increase value for selling it damn well better not matter for taxes.", "Because litigation is always super fun and never more costly than it\u2019s worth.", "Yeah, that doesn't even make sense.  None of the neighbors would want someone else's fence cutting off part of *their* lots.", "The so what is OP already seems bothered by how others might be viewing them.  This will definitely escalate things", "Based on the post, OP didn\u2019t actually sue the neighbor.  OP threatened legal action but apparently did not actually sue.  Without a court case, there is no way for OP to seek legal costs.  OP could ask, but the neighbor would likely tell OP to pound sand.  But without a case there isn\u2019t really a way to get costs.", "This", "OP says elsewhere that the fence was built \u201c12 inches into their property line, delaying planned work they had already scheduled for that summer.\u201d\n\nThe neighbor was an aggressive, arrogant thief - OP did everything right and is NTA.\n\nOP - take your jerk of a neighbor to small claims court to recover your survey costs and legal fees. Nothing says  \u201cNot the Asshole\u201d like a judgement in your favor.", "The judge will not care about whether or not it's your property when you take actions like that.  The fence isn't harming anybody and it's easier to leave the fence where it is than to have the OP put the fence back if it turns out that they were wrong.", "It was measured in the survey I paid for at 12 inches into my property line", "Why the dig at cashiers man? They actually work for not even a livable wage...", "We are talking small claims court here - over in a day.", "It seems really odd she would do this for a measly 12 inches. People are weird. Also seems odd that she wouldn\u2019t talk to you first about putting up a fence and potentially sharing costs etc. at least that\u2019s how we deal with it in our neighborhood. Win win for everyone. What\u2019s the saying again? Tall fences make good neighbors?", "Are you a lawyer? Or do you just play one on the interwebs?", "If they are small plots or zero lot lines 12 inches is a huge amount.", "That question applies to you as well?", "No doubt. Just seems crazy to me if it was done intentionally.", "Yes. And litigation is always super fun and never more costly than it\u2019s worth."]}
