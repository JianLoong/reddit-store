He's a hardworking student and naturally talented, so I'm sure he'll do just fine.\r\n\nThat being said, for the last three months or so, Eric has been chasing after a girl in his grade named Amanda (F16). Initially, Amanda didn't seem very interested in him, and her friends told him that she was \"playing hard to get,\" but now (for the past few weeks) they hang out every now and then.\r\n\nOur parents don't know about Eric and Amanda being in a relationship. They think they\u2019re just friends, as this is what Eric told them.\r\n\nAbout a month ago, Amanda invited Eric over to her house to hang out. He ended up meeting her parents, and according to him, they didn't seem to like him much. Since then, Amanda has stopped inviting him over and told him that her parents thought she was \"a bit out of his league.\" Eric was upset, but Amanda told him things like her parents \u201cjust have really high standards,\u201d \u201che needs to put in more effort,\u201d etc.\r\n\nSince this conversation, Eric has been doing his utmost to try to completely win over Amanda. He buys her gifts, spends hours talking to her, etc. According to Eric, she loves this attention but doesn\u2019t reciprocate it.\r\n\nFor the past month, Eric\u2019s grades have been sliding as he spends less time focused on school and more time on Amanda. So much so, that we had a family meeting about it. Our parents (M54) and (F51) listened to every lame excuse Eric gave about the material being tough and not having enough time. They ate it all up and suggested ways they could help, all of which were rejected by Eric as he insisted he\u2019d be able to turn this around.\r\n\nFast forward to Friday, and Eric tells me that he wants to take Amanda out this weekend, but she rejected it, saying that she\u2019d rather spend time with her friends on this particular weekend. At this stage, I decided to be honest.\r\n\nI told him that he was being an idiot for this entire ordeal. He was hurting his own education and social life (he\u2019s been spending less time with his friends throughout this) for a girl who clearly doesn\u2019t value him.\r\n\nI then told him that if our parents knew the real reason why his grades were sliding, they would be very disappointed and that his behavior was embarrassing. I even told him that it was no wonder Amanda treated him this way as he had very little self-respect.\r\n\nEric started to freak out and asked me what he should do.

He was shocked that I spoke so bluntly to him, he may also be feeling a little hurt as he now knows my honest opinion.
