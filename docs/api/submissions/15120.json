As a result, I learned to love outdoor concerts, and all the way at the back!", "Also also the short girl. Only time I ever asked someone to move was when they pushed their way in front of my and are twice my height. No buddy. No \ud83d\ude02", "Her failure to get to the show early enough to get a good seat is what ruined her night, lol.  Not OP", "It\u2019s honestly part of why I don\u2019t care for concerts. Would love to go to more! But I don\u2019t want to be entitled asking people to move because I\u2019m short, and I *definitely* can\u2019t afford the tickets that would allow me to actually see lol. I\u2019ll appreciate and support my favorite bands from afar, in my headphones haha", "Also the short girl. I wear my tallest platforms and hope for the best. I would never ask someone to move for my view.", "If you choose to show up last minute, you accept the seats that are left and do not demand that people who arranged to be there early to get a good seat give them up for you.  That\u2019s common sense.  The short people in this story were incredibly entitled", "As a short girl at gigs I actually prefer to stand a bit further back. It sort of evens out. You'll never get an excellent view without front row/tiered seating/it being a concert for toddlers and you're the only adult, but a bit further back and you can usually at least see the torso of whoever is performing. Not quite as far back as at home with your headphones, mind you!", "idk if it's reasonable but i'm op's height and go to shows and always thought it was like a universal code of tall guys type thing to keep toward the back\n\nlike helping people reach shit we don't have to do it but it just seems to be the right thing\n\nnah tho he's obviously not obligated", "LMAO, no.  OP got there well before the show started.  The short people showed up 10 minutes after the show started", "Yta like come on", "NTA\nIt shouldn't be expected.\nBeing 5'0\" f, I don't even try to mix in with the crowd at GA shows. Surviving one crowd crush will have that effect. I've never asked someone for their spot but yes have definitely said something to a taller person who steps in front of me and blocks after I've been in my spot.", "I feel like so many of folks here saying no one\u2019s the asshole are unaware of how insanely common it is for folks to use any excuse to get to the front of a concert. I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d and even I get that crap all the time. They *know* what they\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re that worried, get there earlier. I\u2019ve just spent hours in line to get this spot.", "NTA.  But I see a lot of concerts (well, before COVID we had a pretty good average going) and am 6' tall.   I will and always have looked behind me to see if the person is really small, and if there's room I'll say \"Would you like to stand in front of me instead?\" to the people behind.  \n\n\nI don't do this if:  a) they didn't wait their turn...i.e. I waited a long time standing there and they breeze in mid-set to try to just waltz to the front of the viewing area or b) are rude or pushy about it.", "NAH. My boyfriend is 6\u20198\u201d and we always stand toward the back to be nice (I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d so I can usually see fine, as well). However, I agree that you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to move, or guilty if you don\u2019t. People can ask, of course. But you aren\u2019t TA for saying No. If we went to a show that we were really excited about, and my boyfriend was near the stage, and someone asked him to move, it\u2019d break my heart, because I know he\u2019d feel obligated to comply. I can\u2019t blame the girls for trying but, there\u2019s no need to feel bad about it, and I\u2019m sorry it induced some anxiety.", "INFO: what gig?    \n\n\nIf this was at a Dead concert, for example, you would be TA.  At a rap show?  Not TA.", "NAH\n\nassuming they asked nicely and didn't demand or insist.\n\nyou're not an ah for saying no and they're not ahs for asking.", "NTA. I am 5ft3, if I want to be at the front I pay the price needed and get there early, Would never expect someone who has obviously been there early and paid extra to move for me.  Being able to see is just something I always have to consider when going to gigs, show of any kind and plan ahead.", "They knew they were short in plenty of time to get there early enough to get a better spot. I often have people taller than I am who stand in front of me. In fact, now that I have my spinal cord injury, I often just get to watch butts and backs during shows because I can\u2019t stand up very long. NTA.", "This was my view. Unless they were nasty with OP there is no harm in asking. Maybe the person doesn't mind, or maybe they do. But as long as they were polite I don't see the harm, the same way I would not see the harm in OP asking someone for a bit of an accommodation for his height as long as they were polite and accepted a negative answer.", "Omg I\u2019ve had soooo many tall people push in front of me and block my view (5ft here), then proceed to ignore me and pretend not to see me when I say excuse me. It\u2019s infuriating!", "it's not reasonable, it's just nice. now two people are able to see instead of just one. i'm lucky enough that people have done it for me in the past - now i just go to shows where i have a seat"]}
