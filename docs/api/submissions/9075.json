You were a small child when her own mother was giving birth to her. This isn't just about an \"age gap relationship\". He's asking you to parent someone who could easily be your younger sibling. It's problematic on so many levels...\n\nBut, gently, you are also an AH. While I feel a bit sorry for you because (contrary to what I'm sure I'll get yelled at by plenty of Redditors) no 19-year-old is emotionally ready for the onslaught of being love-bombed by a 29-year-old man trying to convince her that she's the love of his life, etc., etc... you were old enough to understand this much:\n\nWhen you marry someone with a child, you do not become that child's \"cool aunt\" or \"big sister\", no matter how close you are to them in age. You become their stepmother. And in this case, that child has been making clear to you FROM DAY ONE how desperately she wanted that mother-daughter relationship. She literally told you that explicitly, that she desperately wanted a mother, had always longed for one. And you played into that; you tried to connect with her over \"woman things\". You are young, but you don't seem stupid, nor hard of hearing. She told you, over and over, that she wanted you to be her mom.\n\nY-T-A for leading that little girl on. You're not an AH for not being ready to be a mother to someone barely younger than you . . . but you are absolutely an AH for staying in the relationship for THREE YEARS and fueling her fantasies if that's the case. This child was already abandoned by her first mother. She doesn't need you to be her \"auntie\". She needs a mom. And at this point if you cannot be that, you're going to do serious damage to her mental health after letting her think you WANT to be her mom for three full years. And you're an AH for talking about \"laying down boundaries\" regarding being her mom when you are literally, legally her stepmother.\n\nESH. That poor child, stuck with a sleazy father and a stepmother who is about to shatter her.", "Esh except the daughter , your husband for getting with you when you were barely older than she is now, you for dating someone with a daughter who's barely younger than you, so you can't form proper bonds with her, like honestly this poor girl has no mom and a dad who dates children an a step mom who's to young to want to her her mom, y'all better start saving for her therapy an your therapy cause you'll both need it in 10 yrs when your frontal cortex's are fully formed an you realized how messed up this entire situation is.", "YWBTA to me. \n\nHere\u2019s why: it\u2019s ok that you\u2019re weirded out by her calling you mom. It\u2019s ok that you don\u2019t feel like a mom, especially since you still seem to have a caring and nurturing relationship with the girl, even if for you it\u2019s not a motherly one. Those things are fine.\n\nWhere you become an asshole is that you are thinking it\u2019s better to hurt your relationship with your new step-daughter, maybe permanently, over this because it makes you feel a little weird. She\u2019s a young girl who\u2019s never really had a mom. She wants one and probably needs one. You chose to step into that role by marrying her father.\n\nMy advice is to bite the bullet here. Deal with the discomfort because you\u2019re an adult and she\u2019s a child who is now in your care. I\u2019d argue that doing this is now your responsibility and the only right thing to do at this point. Think of yourself as an aunt if you want. Continue to be caring and nurturing towards her as you have been. Maybe over more time you\u2019ll (hopefully) feel differently. But don\u2019t break this girl\u2019s heart because you don\u2019t feel like a mother and don\u2019t want to be called mom. Doing so would be very selfish, in this situation.", "I don't understand how it's too soon? You chose to be in a parental role when you chose to marry someone with a child. I can understand why you might feel uncomfortable but I don't thinks its worth the hurt your daughter will feel over this.\n\nSoft Yta", "YTA. You shouldn't have married a man with a child if you didn't want to be a mother.", "Soft YTA.\n\nWhile it's understandable why you feel that way, **nothing good will come out of this if you tell her**. \n\nYou will ruin the relationship between you and her, and you and your husband.", "Your entire relationship is based off of you fulfilling the role of \"mom.\" I mean, why else would a 29 year old single dad get involved with a 19 year old girl?", "I\u2019d want to dig down a bit and figure out why it makes you cringe. Is it because she is only 8 yrs your junior? YTA, if you aren\u2019t ready able and willing to step into those shoes, you need to reconsider your relationship.", "Yta. If you say anything to her, it is going to crush your step daughter. You aren't replacing her mother because her mother skipped out. Why marry him if you don't want her?", "YTA you're going to break her heart and ruin your relationship if you tell her not to. You got involved with a guy with a kid, you should've expected this", "Wow I bet you\u2019ll continue to be an awesome \u201caunt\u201d to her if you and your husband have a \u201creal\u201d kid.", "Soft YWBTA. For now, maybe ask yourself why it makes you so uncomfortable and see if you can work through it. Better that than risk hurting the kid, and messing up your close relationship.", "YTA because I don\u2019t see what your endgame is by telling her this.\n\nThere is no path forward where you tell her she can\u2019t call your norm and it doesn\u2019t hurt it.\n\nTotally understand the weirdness of it. You yourself are fairly young.\n\nThe man you chose had a kid before you met him, it was your decision to be with him. She shouldn\u2019t be punished for that.", "Yeah YTA.  It sounds like it would mean the world to her to call you mom, and you'll crush her when you tell her not to.  Is it because you're closer in age to her than you are to your husband?", "I'm going to go with YTA, but maybe a bit softly. You got involved with a man who has a child with no mother. This was always a possibility from the beginning if you married to become her step-MOTHER, even more so if you were bonding and she'd told you about always wanting a mother. I added the soft part because on some level, I really do get it as she's not biologically yours, or not everyone wants kids (totally ok), and age-wise there's not a huge gap between you two, so it can seem weird. But I still revert back to the original question of why did you get involved with a man with a child then?", "Yta, she told you from the beginning that she was excited to finally have a mom three years ago. If you couldn\u2019t handle it then you should have ended the relationship then. Now this poor girl is attached to you and sees you as the mom she always wanted. Idk why you thought dating a single dad with no mom in the picture didn\u2019t mean you might take on a mom role to his kid.", "I mean... in a legal sense, you are their step-mother. I don't know if you're an AH for this, I think you're just not fully understanding the situation you've walked into. But even if you deny her from calling you mom, on legal documents, you are a step mother.", "YTA-you\u2019re the closest thing she has to \u201cmom\u201d. When you marry someone with a kid, guess what, you get to be a parent now. It comes with the territory. If you\u2019re not comfortable with this, you need to rethink this relationship. If you ask her not to do this you will 100% ruin your relationship with her. The only thing I feel is cringe here is a 29 year old dating a 19 year old.", "Soft YTA- I understand the reluctance, can you come up with a different name other than mom. Like Kamala Harris is Momala to her steps? That still lets her have a \"mom\" but respects your feelings?", "YTA knowing how your stepdaughter felt about you and bonded with you before you even got married, if you weren\u2019t comfortable playing the mom role or being called mom, then You shouldn\u2019t of married a man with a daughter. She\u2019s also a teenager, dealing with hormones and emotions like crazy, and if you tell her that you don\u2019t want her calling you mom because you don\u2019t feel like a mom to her, what do you think that\u2019s going to do to her emotionally and mentally? \n\nIf you\u2019re this uncomfortable with the situation you need to file for an annulment/divorce and let him find someone who wants to take on this role.", "You are still pretty young and having not birthed or contributed dna to a child, u don't feel like a parent, totally understandable, so for that n t a. But this is actually one of the reasons people have an issue with age gap relationships. You chose to marry a guy older than you u has a kid, by that token u are a parent. It u didn't want to be u shldnt have married him. \n\nYWBTA if u tell her not to call u mom, bc doing that might cause her emotional damage u cldnt imagine.  By marrying her dad u really did take a portion of responsibility for her and worrying abt a child's physical and emotional well being is part of that.  \n\nPlease if u can't do that get a divorce now so she has a chance to recover", "YWBTA, sorry you're outvoted. More seriously you are proposing to take away something important, without giving your stepdaughter a suitable replacement. So no one agrees on what titles stepmothers get.", "YWBTA as a former step parent (divorced) literally the most heart warming thing I\u2019ve ever experienced was my step son referring to me as his Dad. I miss him and that love everyday. You have no idea how lucky you are. Embrace it.", "YWBTA\n\nYou are 22 and maybe subconsciously it feels weird that someone 8 years younger than you refers to you as mom and maybe even a bit bothered that in public you may get some looks or feel awkward\u2026.maybe I\u2019m over analyzing this\u2026.\n\nWith being called mom by her you then may be called grandma before you\u2019re ready for it. That\u2019s part of marrying someone who has a daughter that\u2019s closer to your age than his\u2026saying this as someone who\u2019s mother had a step mom closer to her age than fathers age.\n\nShe feels close to you and it would hurt her feelings , she may view it as a rejection.", "YTA.  You plan on having children with said husband right? They will call you mom. You will teach them all the same things.   It's the age gap that has you.  But you need to get over it. It will probably only last till she hits her older teens and then may change to first name. But don't ruin her dream.", "YTA, but softly if done correctly. Be very careful how you ask. Also, you\u2019re a step-mother now. Congrats. How could you possibly not see this coming? Why\u2019d you get involved with man with a kid to the point of marriage if you weren\u2019t ready for the role?", "I would hate to say Y T A, because in all ways that count you seem to have stepped into the role so beautifully.\n\nI don't have kids, so please consider what I am going to say as a suggestion only.\n\nYou could word your request to her in a way where you are asking her to give your special relationship another nickname that conveys this bond that you share. That you don't want to have to replace anyone to make space in her life, that you want your own little space in her heart.", "YWBTA.  I don\u2019t even know what to say here. If you\u2019re not ready to be this girl\u2019s mom you don\u2019t deserve to her dad\u2019s wife either. What are you going to do if you have your own children with this man? Treat them differently? Do you see what the problem is here? I can\u2019t believe I even have to explain this to a grown woman. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "When a teenager starts dating grown man with daughter half her age things usually end up like this.\n\nWhat did you think was going to happen? You seem to be her only mother figure.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You knew he had a child when you married him. Get over your feelings. It\u2019s not always going to be about you.", "YTA, please don't break her heart! \n\nTake her away for a girls weekend and tell he that mom makes you feel old and what about another loving pet name that she comes up with? However it's her decision what she calls you so you'll  have to suck it up and wear the label with pride. \n\n Get ready for her to introduce you to others as her mum and dad, she is proud to belong to you.", "YTA if you ask her not to call you mom. I think this crushes her and you ruin everything you have going with your step-daughter right now.\n\nBut you have made such an impact on this kids life in 3 years that she wants to call you mom, so props to you for being this kids mother figure when her bio mom skipped on her.\n\nI think that in this situation it would be better to silently cringe if you love her like you say you do, who knows you may come to like it a little further down the road or she may outgrow it and start calling you something else.", "YTA This is something she told you about from the first time she met you and three years later it's \"too soon\"?! Yeah you need to just deal with your feelings internally and not destroy that kid's heart. If you haven't sought out therapy, maybe that will help you work through whatever it is that's preventing you from enjoying the bond you cultivated.", "NAH\n\nBeing weirded out by that is not a completely abnormal reaction, especially considering you'd have still been playing with dolls when she was born.\n\nHowever, she has really taken a liking to you and fully accepts you in her life, which is something a lot of blended families don't ever obtain.\n\nI think saying you don't want her to would hurt her at this point. But I think you and her could probably stand a couple of sessions of family counseling to help you both establish boundaries and where y'all are both willing to compromise on issues going forward, and it certainly won't hurt for you to talk out the feelings this issue has created with a professional (in a private session)  who can help you handle it in the best way for your family and for you.\n\nBest wishes on a healthy resolution to this very sticky situation.", "I have a little sister with a larger age gap than what\u2019s between you and your groomers daughter. The fact that you were 18/19 when he decided that as a fully grown adult he would chose you (a semi-child) to raise his child and keep his bed warm is a giant red flag. Of course you feel uncomfortable, your frontal lobe hasn\u2019t even stopped developing and he turned you into a fill in for a 30yr old woman.

Through therapy I have grieved the loss of a mother, because honestly I never really had a true mother. And it sucks, but that's how it is. My dad met my stepmother when I was 16. It's different from 11, but still late. I love her probably more than I love my dad. She has helped me a lot. She will be referred to as grandma when the time comes, but she is not my mom. I wish she was sometimes, but she isn't. That doesn't make her any less a person I love and cherish. You may be a maternal figure to this kid, but you are not her mom. She unfortunately doesn't have a mom, but she has a you. This is my personal take, people will probably disagree, but I kept scrolling and my thoughts kept coming back to this post. You can have an awesome relationship with her. You can be her number 1 person. But it doesn't sound like you consider yourself her mom. And that is totally reasonable. My cousins have a bigger age gap then you and her. It sounds like this girl had been grieving a mom for a long time, but she needs therapy not a stand in. You would be surprised on how mature a 14 year old can be.

I\u2019m just saying that telling someone to \u201cgo touch some grass\u201c is a personal attack. It\u2019s unnecessary and does nothing to strengthen your argument; worse, it speaks of emotional immaturity.\n\nYou don\u2019t have any sources for what you\u2019re claiming and instead are being condescending in order to win the argument. Do better.", "I'm not arguing that drinking age is arbitrary; it is. I'm arguing that with being legally able to drink, you experience life as an adult, with all the inherent joys and responsibilities that come with it. When I said touch grass, I didn't say when, so it's in you whether or not to go out in the big scary dark.\n\nFunny enough, I know damn well that 19 is an adult. I was married to my first spouse at 18, so I get it. They are not my current spouse, and very few people I know who got married around that age are still married to the same person, so I would argue that 19 being an adult does not necessarily equate to maturity. Some people are very mature at that age, but in my experience, most are not. And being married at that age doesn't even compare to being a step parent at that age, especially a teenager. For reference, my step parent married my parent when step was 26 and parent was 36. I was 16. I can't even begin to tell you how step was awful, but I will say that agree 40 years of marriage, my parent had enough BS from them and gave them their walking papers. So maybe I have some experience in this arena. You?"]}
