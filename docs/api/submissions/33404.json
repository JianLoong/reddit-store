Fast forward to yesterday and he has done fuck all and is so bad that he couldn't figure out why his code was not working when it literally tells you on the screen, what the actual error is...\n\nEvery single day for the last 2 weeks, he would call me, share his screen and tell me he's facing an issue to which I'm just reading whatever error is on his screen and telling him to resolve it based on it's suggestion, which is again, on his screen. After about 9 occurrences of this, I told him to try reading the error and resolve it to which for whatever reason, he can't do it.\n\nI ended up telling my manager that this guy is an idiot and explained how so yesterday and got him fired this morning. Apparently his previous team had the same issue with him hence why he got fired because changing teams clearly didn't work.\n\nThe guy called me earlier today and said \"you're an asshole and a elitist\" and sent me a long 1500 word essay to my work email telling me how I'm not perfect myself, how my instructions weren't clear and how I practically ruined his life by getting him fired in this awful job market. I later found out that this guy does not even have a bachelors degree which automatically disqualifies him from most tech jobs given that he has little experience.\n\nAITA? I don't see how is it my job to babysit some dipshit who can't read. Imagine if you tried to post on reddit and it clearly says \"Please login\" and you decide to call me instead and ask me \"hey why can't I post? how do I know what's my login details?\", that's what this moron was doing to me.\n\nEdit: Wow downvote already?

I myself as a senior member of a team (non-tech) would probably tolerate 3 occurrences of cluelessness while training unless they are working in some airgapped shit in a shielded room which stops them from looking stuff up on the internet.

Team Leads like you are invaluable.  Thank youl.", "NTA... You shouldn\u2019t be tasked with babysitting someone that cannot Learn, develop or seek answers to their problems before creating an issue for someone else to resolve. This is someone that isn\u2019t capable of critical thinking or problem solving. They have already been burdensome to other teams this was your boss giving him a last chance and he failed. He blames you because otherwise he\u2019d have to blame himself. We already know looking inward isn\u2019t on the menu for this guy. Don\u2019t sweat it. Tell your boss you want the next rockstar for putting up with the degenerate.", "I used to work at a tech company. We had to quickly part ways with a Manager on the Support Team because she was not tech savvy. When sharing her screen a colleague asked her to go to the URL bar but she did not know what it meant.

She was hired to help train the support reps on our product\u2026 that was one of the many red flags in the short 2 weeks she lasted.", "NTA\n\nHe knew what he needed to do, his job.

It's obvious that this person was moved out from their previous team due to poor performance and has no place on yours. Their lack of fundamental abilities and inability to read errors is a significant warning sign. You gave them a chance, but it's not your job to babysit someone who can't complete their work. Your manager recognized the issue and agreed that this person needed to be let go. The former junior developer's response, which included insults and a long-winded essay, only confirms that you made the right decision. It's unfortunate that some people refuse to take responsibility for their own shortcomings and instead blame others for their failures.", "Just wanna say, can totally get a well paying IT job with no degree. Very easily. Certifications, a great portfolio, and experience hold much more value. So dont be discouraged, anyone reading this.", "NTA - it goes beyond not being trained, he doesnt have the aptitude to dig in and solve issues himself so you'd always be doing a large chunk of his work. If he cant even read error messages that are clear he's never going to google and investigate when he hits a hurdle.  training you can give, an attitude that badly suited is a lot harder to fix.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't get him fired, he got himself fired, for being a dipshit.", "So, you speak very unpleasantly about him, which undermines your case a bit, but, bottom line, if he's not only unqualified but unable to do the job, I don't see that your company had any choice but to let him go. Ignore the stuff he said to you - it's not your fault. It's perfectly appropriate to pass concerns about a colleague's performance up the line to a manager so that they can look at the performance in closer detail and intervene. \n\nBut you'll be doing yourself a favour if you learn to express your concerns politely and professionally.", "NTA. These people are such a damn drain and need to be fired. Not everyone is cut out for software development but you do get some chancers who are attracted by the high salaries.
