Because that\u2019s what he and his family are doing.  They\u2019re trying to manipulate you into abandoning your brother.  This isn\u2019t about your mom.  It\u2019s about your brother.

You might think you\u2019re doing it to save your family.  But saving your family isn\u2019t something you can achieve.  That\u2019s between your mom and your dad.

Or to validate your father\u2019s repudiation of his son.", "No, you should not, in my opinion try to convince your mother to back down to your father.

Your father threw down a threat and when that backfired he\u2019s trying to convince people he\u2019s literally in danger of dying if he doesn\u2019t get his way. He\u2019s responsible for his own health and it\u2019s not contingent on your mother turning away her own son and rejecting the values she clearly has. It\u2019s not your place to be the \u201cpeacemaker\u201d here. Their marriage is between them and i would advise you to stay out of it. I\u2019m actually so proud of your mother for being strong enough to go against generations of conditioning and stand up for what she believes is right. I highly doubt anything would change his opinions anyway, even if she did go back. He\u2019d see it as his victory and his right to control. Sometimes all it takes is one brave woman to change the world. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not easy for you to see your family broken, but the fix would not be worth the cost.
