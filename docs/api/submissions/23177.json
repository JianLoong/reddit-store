Please be brave and go and seek some help with your relationship with food, this isn't a matter of \"self-discipline\", it's a matter of your mental health and I think you recognise that. Please don't beat yourself up about it or be ashamed, please take that first step of talking to someone.  \n\n\nNTA, although for your niece's own social awareness and education, perhaps you could have gently told her that some personal opinions need to be kept to yourself and not shared with the person concerned.

Yes, you're overweight, but if you're 6 feet tall, then, at 300 or even 320, you're not so overweight that I would do a double take when I saw you. I imagine you look quite normal. And I don't see any reason for you to feel ashamed for how you live. No one likes feeling out of control, but being overweight or even having BO is not a moral failing (though do step up your hygiene routine if you think it's a problem).

What she can\u2019t do is decide for you what does and doesn\u2019t make you feel ashamed.\n\nI cringe at the word \u201cfat\u201d because in my experience it\u2019s too subjective. The person in my life who used it most called themselves and others fat when they were anything more than severely underweight. However, its not my place to monitor that word with others, just like your sister is out of line for monitoring how you should talk and feel.\n\nI\u2019m not going to comment on your weight. What I will comment on is how you talk about yourself. There is a very thin line between being comfortable with factual information and being accepting of negative information because one feels like it\u2019s deserving.\n\nIt\u2019s very easy to fall into the trap of starting a vicious cycle. I worry you think that because you are struggling you aren\u2019t deserving of positive reinforcement or self love until you reach a certain goal, making you have less confidence and more likely to struggle.\n\nSomeone can be worthy of love and be worthy of self care and good things while still being an addict. Someone can love themself and their body while still striving to be more healthy.\n\nI\u2019m a big believer that working through mental health is the best way to work through weight struggles. \n\nI hope you are seeing someone to help with your food addiction that\u2019s familiar with the issue.\n\nI also hope you know that who you are, right now, is worthy of love.", "NTA at all!\n\nWell done for being able to take what was said. You have a very positive attitude to your condition. And even if you aren\u2019t yet working on it, being able to be okay with people telling you about it is great. Your next little step will be to hear the same things without it even hurting. \n\nYour sister needs to learn that if someone has no issue with being told they\u2019re fat or smelly or anything else, like you then she doesn\u2019t need to be offended on their behalf. It sounds like she\u2019s the kind of person that gets offended at every little thing and is deeply insecure (which you definitely aren\u2019t!) about things like this.", "NTA. Your sister is the one to educate her child about social behaviours, it's one of the major jobs as a parent that most fail at these days.\n\nGood on you for having that perspective about your weight, I was in a similar situation a few years back - 6' and about 270lbs - It isn't easy but people really shouldn't sugarcoat it either (mainly because I'd probably eat that too).\n\nSometimes it takes a nice chat and therapy to get over it, sometimes it takes a kick. It really depends on the person. I think therapy may be more beneficial than the kick your niece gave you due to food addiction.\n\nPortion control is where I started, reduce your meal sizes, limit the amount of snacks your allowed then look towards small bodyweight exercises - musclewiki is a great source for that - and then the flexibility and ease of movement will be the thing that encourages you to keep it up - this is what worked for me anyway, everyone's different but overall only you can help yourself.\n\nThis next suggestion isn't healthy but did also work for me to keep at exercise - You seem to have a bit of self-loathing, use it. I hate doing exercise, but I hate myself more, so fuck that guy I'm gonna do something he hates.", "NTA But how could you not realize you smell so bad ? A kid has to tell you ? And your sister never denied it, she just has a problem with the niece bc she said it. But it's obviously true. The kid did you a kindness and a huge favor. You really should have her back. Maybe if more people were honest with you, you wouldnt be here today. IMO your sister is the one treating you poorly. Your niece is treating you as her equal, as in, you deserve to hear the truth instead of it being hidden away from you like you're a  toddler (like the way your 'caring' sister treats you). I dont know. Food for thought.", "NTA !!!!!\n\nYour niece didn't know what was going, 6 year olds barely know anything. Your sister feels embarrassed and is trying to find a way to pin it on you because she is scared she will be blamed. I hope your sister doesn't actually follow through.", "NTA, why does your sister need you to correct niece's behavior?

Doing so is not helping. Letting someone know they need to step up hygiene for an odor, totally fine. Telling them they smell because they're fat? No way man.

Once, unbeknownst to me, my eyeshadow smeared (I rode to work) between when I applied it and when class started, and it looked like I had a black eye. My coworkers said nothing; \"politely\" ignoring my apparent injury. My students? First thing out of their mouths as they entered my room, \"What happened to your eye? Who hit you? Did you fall?\" I was like uh, what? Checked my face in the closet mirror and was like oh wow. Would have been nice if someone had let me know my makeup was terrible. I'd interacted with like 5 adults that morning. It was spring, no where near Halloween or dress up times. Later, after I fixed it, one of the adults actually said, \"What happened to your eye?\" and I said, \"That was a makeup snafu,\" and she said, \"Oh, I thought you had a black eye.
