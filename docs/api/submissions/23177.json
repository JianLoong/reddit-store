It really depends on the person. I think therapy may be more beneficial than the kick your niece gave you due to food addiction.\n\nPortion control is where I started, reduce your meal sizes, limit the amount of snacks your allowed then look towards small bodyweight exercises - musclewiki is a great source for that - and then the flexibility and ease of movement will be the thing that encourages you to keep it up - this is what worked for me anyway, everyone's different but overall only you can help yourself.\n\nThis next suggestion isn't healthy but did also work for me to keep at exercise - You seem to have a bit of self-loathing, use it.

Maybe if more people were honest with you, you wouldnt be here today. IMO your sister is the one treating you poorly.

Doing so is not helping. Letting someone know they need to step up hygiene for an odor, totally fine. Telling them they smell because they're fat? No way man.

Today I saw one- \u201cmarried for 20 years, how do I tell me husband he needs deodorant\u201d\n\nAnd as the recipient, having it come from a little kid that loves me would be about the least painful way to hear it. I hope OP can use it to make some positive changes. \n\nAs a side note, I should start a business where you can hire adorable children to give bad news or have difficult conversations \ud83d\ude06", "Why would you assume the OP is a woman when the only things we know about them are their height (6') and approximate weight? Many more men are six feet tall.", "I am quite large and I use deodorant, cologne and maintain proper hygiene.", "Mom: \"You mustn't say things like that, it's rude and hurtful.\"\n\nNiece: \"I said it to OP and OP doesn't mind!\"\n\nMom: \\*facepalm\\*", "As a general rule you don\u2019t tell people about issues with how they look unless it can be corrected immediately. You have something in your teeth, your dress is tucked into your pantyhose, your zipper is down, the seat of your pants is ripped.  telling someone they smell is the same as telling them the seat of their pants is ripped. If they leave the issue can be corrected that day. Telling them about something they cannot solve is just being cruel. People will say they are brutally honest to get away with saying hurtful thing but those people are just using honestly as a way to be brutal.", "That\u2019s pretty dark, OP.\n\nYou were so kind to your niece, when many people wouldn\u2019t have been. That kindness is worth so much. Maybe it\u2019s hard for you to see that right now, but I hope that one day, you will.", "You should get help either way because years with help and support will be a lot more enjoyable than those years without it.\n\nMental illness is a hell of a trickster, telling you things don't get better and you don't deserve help. You do, and they will. I can say that confidently because everyone does, but more so because your post is sweet and shows self awareness and kindness. \n\nAlso tbh at your height and weight you will be waiting a LONG TIME to die, yeah it's large but nowhere near big enough to just keal over, so you better be giving up on hopes of short now, Mr!!", "I think she\u2019s very smart for her age and she showed compassion at such a young age\u2026 I hope her mom doesn\u2019t punish her for that", "You\u2019re right, I made an assumption! I shouldn\u2019t have.", "Intentions always matter."]}
