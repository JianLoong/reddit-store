Yes, you're overweight, but if you're 6 feet tall, then, at 300 or even 320, you're not so overweight that I would do a double take when I saw you. I imagine you look quite normal. And I don't see any reason for you to feel ashamed for how you live.

It really depends on the person. I think therapy may be more beneficial than the kick your niece gave you due to food addiction.\n\nPortion control is where I started, reduce your meal sizes, limit the amount of snacks your allowed then look towards small bodyweight exercises - musclewiki is a great source for that - and then the flexibility and ease of movement will be the thing that encourages you to keep it up - this is what worked for me anyway, everyone's different but overall only you can help yourself.\n\nThis next suggestion isn't healthy but did also work for me to keep at exercise - You seem to have a bit of self-loathing, use it.

And your sister never denied it, she just has a problem with the niece bc she said it. But it's obviously true. The kid did you a kindness and a huge favor. You really should have her back. Maybe if more people were honest with you, you wouldnt be here today. IMO your sister is the one treating you poorly.

You have something in your teeth, your dress is tucked into your pantyhose, your zipper is down, the seat of your pants is ripped.  telling someone they smell is the same as telling them the seat of their pants is ripped. If they leave the issue can be corrected that day. Telling them about something they cannot solve is just being cruel. People will say they are brutally honest to get away with saying hurtful thing but those people are just using honestly as a way to be brutal.", "That\u2019s pretty dark, OP.\n\nYou were so kind to your niece, when many people wouldn\u2019t have been. That kindness is worth so much. Maybe it\u2019s hard for you to see that right now, but I hope that one day, you will.", "You should get help either way because years with help and support will be a lot more enjoyable than those years without it.\n\nMental illness is a hell of a trickster, telling you things don't get better and you don't deserve help.

I can say that confidently because everyone does, but more so because your post is sweet and shows self awareness and kindness. \n\nAlso tbh at your height and weight you will be waiting a LONG TIME to die, yeah it's large but nowhere near big enough to just keal over, so you better be giving up on hopes of short now, Mr!!", "I think she\u2019s very smart for her age and she showed compassion at such a young age\u2026 I hope her mom doesn\u2019t punish her for that", "You\u2019re right, I made an assumption! I shouldn\u2019t have.", "Intentions always matter.", "NAH. It's not your fault your sister chewed her out. However, I disagree with your line of thinking here. You frame this is a \"well I am fat, so it's something I deserved,\" when you should frame this as a wakeup call to start being more active and eating healthier. I recommend starting with going for a walk every day and adding vegetables and lean proteins into what you already eating and making healthy switch ups. It's easier to slowly add on more from there. \n\nImagine if you actually lost weight and got healthier, so that you could tell your niece how she helped you realize that.", "I don't think you're an asshole at all.

Or maybe the \"bad person\" in some old Disney Movies said something like that and she wanted to try ot out on you because she did not really understand the connection and hoped for a reaction and an explanation.\n\nI do not think she was intentionally rude, but as in many societies it is considered rude to comment on anybodies weight, it is all right to tell a child of her age that the topic along with her wording could hurt people, and better not to talk about it with strangers.\n\nIt is great you have such a good relationship to your niece! But your sisters reaction is a bit weird. Why should she superwise you because of an encounter that hurt you, if anybody? Is she insecure herself and does not want her child to talk to her like that?  But if it is so easy to \"correct\" her, why is she worried that you did not immediately do it? There will be many opportunities to teach her daughter manners, it is her job, and a lot of people do not want others to correct their children at all. So why expecting it from you? Your job as an aunt is primarily to spoil your nieces and nephews, not to teach them!\n\nKnowing you, your sister should in my opinion have asked you if you are all right instead of criticising you. She was not very warm hearted at this moment. There is no telling from the short episode you shared, but if things like that happen more often, maybe think of therapy to rule out toxic family dynamics as a source of stress to you.\n\nPlease do not hate yourself for being who you are! You are obviously a very nice person. A lot of sensitive and wellmeaning people are permanently stressed these days. Things to worry about get more, time and money gets less, so we all crave for love, understanding and support, and are hardly able to give it. \n\nIf additionally you are a stress eater, as I am, you easily end up overweight. But as it is to no one a problem except maybe for you, please stop judging yourself or thinking about other peoples opinions on this, if possible.\n\nOP, I hope you find a way to enjoy life and accept yourself! Take care!", "NTA. She asked first if it was okay to tell you something and you said yes. Kids are blunt and unaware of all the social norms around a person's weight. It would be weird to scold someone else's child for saying something they didn't know was bad. Has your sister previously told you that she wants your niece to be correct when she comments on your weight? I doubt it because it was the first time it happened.", "6 ft. and 300 lbs isn't anywhere near social life ending. Taller women especially tend to weigh more than taller men due to how fat is distributed in the body. I think that you have body image issues resulting from depression or other mental illness, speaking from experience!! Yes, smelling bad is one thing because it's something that you can change relatively easily when it's pointed out, but your niece's comment about your weight should have been corrected. It's not just about you at that point, because now she might think it's ok to say things like that to other people who can't immediately control what size they are and might take it worse than you. Also being fat doesn't equal smelling bad, which might be an incorrect assumption on her part that you could've let her know. I think a simple \" that's not a very nice thing to say, that could hurt someone's feelings\" would've sufficed tbh", "NTA.\n\nSister just needed to have a gentle conversation with niece.  Kids that age have no filter, they just call it like they see it.  It\u2019s not intended to be hurtful, they are just stating the facts.\n\nHaving spent quite a bit of time as a classroom helper over the years, the prep class is a wild ride, and not the place to venture if you are all sensitive.", "NTA\nYour sister doesn't get to tell you how to feel about your weight and the side effects of ot", "Yikes I am sorry. NTA! Kids can be so cringe. But your sister is worse. Maybe you can look into therapy and I take a med called Contrave (there is a cheaper generic version too) that has helped with my food addiction.", "Wow, your sister sucks! NTA for not scolding your niece for her honesty. You know she's right and you know your addiction is taking years off your life, and years from the relationship you can have with her. She didn't shame you, ridicule you or insult you. She talked to you kindly and with compassion, instead of letting you go to her meet and be embarrassed by others, who don't love you enough to be kind. \n\nYour sister making this your problem and banning you from seeing your niece is next level cruel. You sound acutely depressed. Please consider getting some help, to talk through your feelings and understand why you use food to cope with your pain.\n\nI wish you all the luck and love in the world.", "Your neice needs to learn you cannot go around saying deeply hurtful and thoughtless things like \"I think you smell bad because you are fat\". I suspect your self esteem is so low that your first instinct is to blame yourself and accept criticism. Your neice is six so she is at that age where she hasn't developed a filter yet. But she will not learn to develop a filter unless she is corrected. You don't have to scream at her; just say \"it hurts people's feelings to comment on their weight so you shouldn't do that.\" It may also help to explain the difference between bringing up smell (an issue you didn't realise and can fix) and commenting on weight. I seriously doubt your neice was being malicious but it will be detrimental to her social skills in the long run to not to be corrected. Very gentle YTA but you are not an AH. I just disgree with how you handled this particular situation.", "NAH\n\nYour sister was right that what she said was inappropriate and needs correction, but should have been more compassionate about the fact that it's hard to speak up as a victim. You were right that your niece was being honest and that it's your prerogative to be comfortable with what she said (though I gotta say it sounds like you have some really unhealthy self-loathing, which is probably both a product of your weight and a factor making it worse), but most people would not be comfortable being verbally shamed like that, so you should be understanding of why your sister wants to make sure she doesn't go around saying that to other people. Most people don't respond well to shame, and based on your eating binge in reaction to it, it sounds like you don't either, even if you feel you deserve it.", "It sounds like the sister didn\u2019t bother scolding her own child, but scolded OP instead. Parenting fail, IMO. She should have been calling to apologize, even though the child was being brutally honest.", "People taking time out of their day to say my lived experience is fake or made will be the thing that pushes me to check out for good.", "Someone is going through and downvoting any and all comments that suggest that shaming himself isn\u2019t working - and it clearly isn\u2019t. These people want to shame fat people and don\u2019t care whether or not it is productive, they just want to hate.", "I'm sorry.... what? Are you going around killing fat people? Wtf kind of comment is this?", "Shame is also counterproductive. He felt shame after his nieces comments and turned to binge eating.", "Not an option. You can't check out for at least 2 more years, or your niece will be blamed for it You need antidepressants, therapy, and the desire to be more than you are today.

It's fine for them to say \"hey, next time she says something inappropriate, it's totally OK to correct her\". Expecting/demanding someone else to do that isn't ok.

It's great if they're willing/able to correct the kid in a way the parents find acceptable, but that's a bonus, not an expectation.", ">  Expecting/demanding someone else to do that isn't ok.\n\nI agree with that, but OP is acting like there was nothing to teach the kid, OP is acting like what the kid said was socially acceptable, which is what I take issue with.", "I wouldn't find that behavior acceptable either, but that's not our call. Every parent has to manage situations where they're trying to correct a behavior that another person doesn't have a problem with. \n\nAs an example, kiddo used to have a really bad habit of not paying attention to her surroundings, and would occasionally whack a nearby person with the shopping basket when we were in the store. Like she'd change her mind on the snack she picked, spin around and thwack. Every time it happened, we'd repeat the \"that's not ok, you just hit someone, go apologize and don't do it again\". Occasionally, we'd have to deal with a well-intentioned person who'd say something like \"oh, it's not your fault, you don't need to apologize\". They promptly got the death glare. But it meant we needed to reinforce the lesson that just because someone isn't upset doesn't mean the behavior is ok. The same lesson applies here.", "Intentions can make hurtful things hurt more, but they can't make them hurt less.", "Not as much as impact does. That\u2019s why we have the expression, \u201cthe road to hell is paved with good intentions.\u201d", "Actions matter more.", "> Every parent has to manage situations where they're trying to correct a behavior that another person doesn't have a problem with.\n\nSure like OP shouldn't be the one correcting the behavior, but OP also shouldn't be arguing with the kid's parent about whether or not the behavior is acceptable. *Especially* when it's behavior that is likely to be viewed as unacceptable by most of society other than OP. Like, it's fine if you aren't offended by swears, but if your niece or nephew is dropping f-bombs and the parent has a problem with it, there's a difference between saying \"I'm not going to tell your kid how to speak\" and saying \"Your kid should be allowed to say fuck.\" \n\nOP said things like \"I should be ashamed for how I live.\" which is *not* a message that the kid should be taught, *even* if OP isn't the right person to teach the kid that what she said was inappropriate. \n\n>\"oh, it's not your fault, you don't need to apologize\"\n\nRight but I think that if the person who got whacked and then said that was your kiddo's aunt or uncle, you'd be well within your rights to ask them not to give your kid that message. *Even* if you don't expect them to be the ones to teach your kid the lesson that you want the kid to learn about the situation.", "Perception is what matters, not the speaker\u2019s intentions. Anyone can have b.o. for a number of reasons. Pointing out OP\u2019s weight as the reason was rude.", "NTA\n\nAs hard as it is, it's something you would want to know if people kept thinking about it and didn't bother to tell you. Also for a 6 year old, it sounds like your niece handled it quite respectfully. You reacting negatively to it could have impacted her honesty towards adults in the long run", "NTA? What the hell is wrong with your sister? Getting mad at you for you not scolding her daughter for something you weren't even mad about? Even if you were mad about it, we don't usually go around scolding other people's kids. Sounds like a conversation she should be having with her own daughter.", "NTA, imo. She\u2019s a kid and you can see the truth in her words, what is there to scold for that?\n\nI am piggybacking on this comment, though, just to gently ask you about your food addiction. I\u2019m projecting, but eating is comforting to me. I\u2019m an emotional eater, a term I hate because it sounds like you\u2019ve gotta be crying and sad and upset or *feeling* something to \u201ceat your feelings.\u201d Nah, not for me. I\u2019m bored, I\u2019ll eat. I\u2019m happy, I\u2019ll eat. I\u2019m depressed, I\u2019ll eat. I\u2019ve got anxiety, I\u2019ll eat. Etcetera. Eating has been a way for my subconscious to avoid the shit I\u2019m not ready to deal with. And people make it sound like it\u2019s just \u201cso easy\u201d to not eat. Well, not when eating is the only thing that brings you comfort when the very fact of living feels uncomfortable.\n\nIf you are avoiding something subconsciously, I highly recommend looking into therapy, OP. I often spout it, but I feel I\u2019ve been very fortunate to find a therapist that actually gives a shit (finally). I have gone through the bad ones and the good ones. I\u2019m happy to share my experience and thoughts if you feel like you\u2019d benefit from it. My DMs are open if any of this sounds like it rings true for you and you\u2019d like to chat. If not, I am wishing you all the best.", "Lol, your sister is mad her kid was (unintentionally) rude to you, but she herself is just as rude asking you to respond in a way you disagree with. You don't have to scold your niece. You're allowed to manage your own boundaries and responses. Your sister needs a scolding herself.\n\nBut I think you should find a good counsellor/therapist. Not necessarily with the goal to help you lose weight, but with the goal to help you boost your feelings about yourself and come to terms with your addiction. You have worth as a person, and deserve to feel happy, just as you are.", "NTA\nIt sounds like you have a lovely relationship with your niece. Perhaps you could have made the point that she can say those things (politely) to you but not to other people. Apart from that I commend you on your honesty & willingness to acknowledge the truth.", "NTA, can\u2019t say the same for your sister though. She basically didn\u2019t care about how you felt, she didn\u2019t call you to say \u201coh she\u2019s just a kid, I hope she didn\u2019t upset you\u201d etc. she called you to hurt you even more. She needs to understand that parenting is her job. She\u2019s the one who needs to teach not to \u201cfat shame\u201d, not you.", "NTA but listen. You don't deserve to be shamed. It's isn't motivating or helpful, which is pretty clear with what happened here. You felt ashamed and then ate to compensate for it. Shame is not the answer. You need to be kinder to yourself.", "I definitely understand why it upset you; and I also understand not wanting to discipline someone else's kid.\n\nYour sister's anger sounds misplaced.  She shouldn't be giving you such an odd rule, but if she's allowing you to correct her, she is right, it isn't nice.\n\nNAH", "nta. niece was polite, and you handle the critique extremely well. your sister needs to calm tf down she is acting as if a crime was committed.", "NtA.  In fact, I think you point out why you are an emotional eater.  I'm sorry you don't have the support you need from your family.   You soind like you are an exceptionally nice person. Hugs to you.", "NTA, And I don\u2019t think the kid is TA either\u2014she\u2019s a kid, she\u2019s learning how to be social. \n\nBut the thing is she\u2019s got to have heard that from somewhere. Yes, as an adult I know that sometimes lots of weight means that hygiene can be difficult, which can cause smell and other issues\u2014but she\u2019s a kid. She doesn\u2019t necessarily connect that fat=smell (which shouldn\u2019t really be connected since it\u2019s an oversimplification). \n\nShe\u2019s either seen it as a joke in cartoons\u2014which, honestly? As someone who watches kid\u2019s cartoons sometimes when they\u2019re on for little siblings, there\u2019s a lot of fart/scent jokes tied to \u201cwell this character is ugly/fat/some sort of social outcast! And they smell!\u201d \n\nAlternatively, her mother has commented to her something about your weight and smell. \n\nThe thing is, there\u2019s a duality here. She does need to learn that there\u2019s some subjects you don\u2019t bring up (at least, you need to understand the risk to the other person\u2019s emotions if you DO bring it up), but also it\u2019s ok to talk to loved ones honestly if you think they may need the talk. \n\nRegardless, there\u2019s no situation where you\u2019re an asshole for not correcting her\u2014that would be her mother\u2019s job. I\u2019d be far too afraid to try to correct a child (as someone who isn\u2019t a parent). It\u2019s a weird take to, if she thinks you\u2019re a victim, blame you for not correcting the kid. \n\nAlso, if you can I\u2019d suggest trying to reach out to therapy. I also think getting out to events\u2014like your nieces activities! Or family stuff\u2014would be helpful. As other commenters have said, you cannot improve with this addiction if you don\u2019t have another source of joy. I know from experience with yo-yo\u2019ing weight that I CANNOT lose weight if I don\u2019t make a huge effort to keep my mental health at a certain minimum. \n\nI hope things get better for you.", "NTA, but please don't be ashamed. Shame isn't going to help, it's just another whip to beat yourself with, and self-hatred isn't going to fix your health or your relationship with food. And frankly, hating or being ashamed of your body can make it harder to stay clean and healthy, if you're trying to minimize touching yourself when you bathe, you'll miss spots where sweat or yeast can build up.\n\nYour niece wasn't trying to hurt you, so I don't think there was call to rebuke her. If you want to make a change to the smell issue, a detachable shower head, showering without the lights on, and showering with music playing are all things that might make it easier to clean yourself thoroughly - either by letting you make sure everything is soaped and rinsed thoroughly, or by making it easier to deal with your own naked body, if that's hard for you.\n\nI hope you're able to get some help for your relationship with food and with your body - you sound like a very nice person and you deserve to be happy, and it doesn't sound like you are.", "Yta - here's the thing.

But it's not nice to guess why people smell.\"", "NAH, your sister has a right to expect her kid not to grow up thinking she can say mean things (and I guarantee that the little girl knows calling someone fat is a mean thing) no matter how true they are. I can also see why you didn't want to call her out over being honest. \n\nWhat if she told an elder they smell funny because they are old? That's just not cool and telling kids to not say mean things is how they learn not to end up getting hated by their family and friends later on in life.", "NAH and you have one of the healthier views about this that I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m not saying you should be ashamed of yourself, but you certainly shouldn\u2019t be happy or proud about being that overweight.

Shame is gripping, and paralyzingly and overwhelming. It\u2019s one of those feelings that truly is so unbearable that yeah, you\u2019d do anything to get away from it :( But therapy (with the right therapist!) can help you train your own brain to recognize and eventually overcome those tricky thinking patterns that can turn into self harm, shame, guilt and self loathing. \n\nIt\u2019s an enormous, overwhelming, and daunting amount of work that one has to do to pull ourselves out of those very dark places, but all these strangers here are telling you to hold fast and and keep trying because we know it can be done, we\u2019ve done it. And we\u2019re just regular people like you. You deserve self love, and to be able to experience at *least* as much joy as you have suffering. And I\u2019m not talking about your weight, not at all.
