It really depends on the person. I think therapy may be more beneficial than the kick your niece gave you due to food addiction.\n\nPortion control is where I started, reduce your meal sizes, limit the amount of snacks your allowed then look towards small bodyweight exercises - musclewiki is a great source for that - and then the flexibility and ease of movement will be the thing that encourages you to keep it up - this is what worked for me anyway, everyone's different but overall only you can help yourself.\n\nThis next suggestion isn't healthy but did also work for me to keep at exercise - You seem to have a bit of self-loathing, use it.

They have thoughts in their heads and they speak them aloud. This is a normal stage of development. \n\nYour niece, like all children that age, was honest in the kindest, most innocent way possible. She had no malicious intent to be cruel. Your sister wanted to protect your feelings, which is nice. She wants her daughter to be thoughtful and compassionate with her words, which is great. However, your niece did exactly what a child her age learning about the world is supposed to do. The nuance comes later with age and maturity. Your sister needs to lay off. \n\nYou were amazing to take the comment from your niece in stride even as it collided with your own views of self worth and shame. It must have been really hard. You\u2019re a good aunt.", "YTA.", "YTA being obese is no reason to smell. I am quite large and I use deodorant, cologne and maintain proper hygiene. Being overweight has nothing to do with your hygiene but it seems like you are conceding that this is a truth.", "Gentle YTA. I can see where your sister is coming from. Just because something is true, doesn\u2019t mean we have to say it out loud. She is learning that she can blurt out facts, true but unkind facts, and face no consequences. This What if she starts calling strangers fat or smelly? Her friends at school or teachers? \n\nSome things we say and some things we keep to ourselves. Children can learn this, they understand things, adults brush them off with \u201cthey\u2019re just kids they don\u2019t understand\u201d but they do, and the faster the better.", "\u201cI said I hate that term and I should be ashamed of how I live\u201d\n\nYTA to yourself. How has that sense of shame worked out for you? It\u2019s obvious that you hold a lot of hatred and judgement toward yourself - has it actually led to a change in behavior? How has that shame motivated you to develop healthy habits?\n\nIt\u2019s a common misconception that hating yourself is an effective motivator to lose weight, but study after study proves it\u2019s not true. Why would you go out of your way to change yourself for someone you hate? You need to develop some compassion for yourself, you hold value NOW. As a fat person, as a thin person, regardless of your stage of life you owe it to yourself to give some love to the person inside.", "Who in he\\*$ is your sister to tell you how to feel?  lol kids are going to be honest (for good or bad smh) and she should be encouraging that instead of teaching her daughter how to lie.  You are a great uncle and your niece will always love you.  NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s not on the person who was on the receiving end of a rude comment to explain why it was hurtful, and your sister\u2019s misplaced blame is probably because she\u2019s embarrassed because she knows it was a hurtful thing.", "How does one eat oneself to numbness?", "NTA. Your sister can parent her own child, teaxh her manners if need be.  It wasn't up to you to correct her.  She and you had an honest conversation.  Your sis is overreacting by getting angry.", "NTA.

It\u2019s not your job to parent her, and at that age her parents should\u2019ve already taught her basic manners. If she\u2019d said that to someone else then I think it would be reasonable for you to step in, but she said it to you, and you handled it like an adult.", "NTA, despite what she is saying it feels like your sister is trying to make you do the hard parenting instead of her talking to her daughter herself.", "NTA. Usually people only directly and bluntly tell people something like that when they love and care about them. She's 6 so she wasn't super graceful about it, but it's still sort of impressive and it's not like she was saying it because she was mad or making fun of you. She probably just wants you to be around her but also doesn't want her friends to think bad things about you.", "Use this as motivation.  Working yourself exhausted at the gym will give you the same high as overeating.", "NTA she didn't 'fat shame ' you, she just pointed it out that your large 'shaming' is thrown around far to easily as a term.  let's face it, you know you're big, the issue might be that this can spur you to change? if not tell your sister you love your niece.", "NTA. I get where your sister is coming from, but I don't understand why your she thinks it makes sense to punish you with an ultimatum for something *your niece* said *about you.* In the end it's her job as the parent to correct her child.", "I was babysitting my 3 year old niece and my husband\u2019s friend was visiting. He was 6\u20196\u201d, probably 400 lbs.  While sitting at the table, looking up at him, she said \u201cMike, you\u2019re belly is sooooo big! I bet your belly button is this big!\u201d She raised her hands up and made a circle about the size of a dinner plate. Mike just laughed. She then asked if she could see it! He just told her that nobody needs to see that!!", "I just want to say that I hope that you are seeking help for your mental health. Life is too short.", "NTA because it isn't your job to teach your niece the lesson your sister wants her to learn.

You need to find compassion for yourself and your body, because that\u2019s the best place to work from if you truly want to change your behavior.", "NTA you handled it well and sound like you\u2019re a great aunt or uncle. Probably a good sibling too, as your sister was hurt on your behalf. As a parent I see where your sister is coming from. She\u2019s embarrassed by her child\u2019s behavior and wants her to learn to do better. But you saw your niece\u2019s comment for what it was, an innocent remark, and handled it well.", "NTA. If the smell is from skin folds and irritation, use  something like cetaphil or Dove to clean in the shower. Dry off completely. Use a hair dryer on low/cool to dry the skin thoroughly. If you have a rash (intertrigo), apply an athletes foot cream or powder. \n\nWhen the smelly rash clears up, use Gold Bond or a knockoff every single day after you shower and dry with a blow dryer. It\u2019s a lot, I know, but it will help you stay clean and fresh while you\u2019re working to get healthier.\n\nIf the smell is from a hygiene issue, invest in a bidet. They are very affordable now. Also a handheld shower wand can help those hard to reach places.\n\nKeep baby wipes handy to freshen up during the day, especially if you sweat when doing physical activity. A quick swipe of your neck and face can make a huge difference.\n\nLastly\u2014Lume deodorants and creams.

Binge eating is a real health problem but spiraling into self-hatred because you\u2019re fat is counterproductive in every way.", "As someone who is 8 inches shorter but about the same weight as OP, I fully agree! I mean this gently, but you need to work on your shame. Maybe you should see a therapist. Maybe it's just a case of finding something you like to do that can help boost your self-esteem. Is there a sport or physical activity you like that you could try to do? Could your sister or another family member do it with you? Getting up and moving is good for physical and mental health and having someone with you can help motivate you.\n\nIn any case, I hope you can find a way to love yourself. Anyone who can handle such a comment gracefully has a lot of good in them. :)", "> I think your sister is probably trying to educate her daughter \n\nThen she needs to do that.

Like how you first walk into a locker room and it slaps you upside the head, but the longer you're in there, the less it seems to reek until you just stop noticing.\n\nAnd socially, most people have been conditioned to not say anything because it's offensive to point out and then you get shamed for not having the grace to keep it to yourself.", "I don't get why you're downvoted because it's so obviously a \"wokes forbid children to insult the lazy smelly obeses\" troll", "I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see. Sometimes I just don\u2019t know\u2014sometimes short is good and shorter is better or best.", "The sister's stance is so close to victim blaming that it's painful. It's like blaming a waitress for not telling off every creep who tries to hit on her or a minority for not 'educating' people why every microagression is harmful. It's not their job to put in the emotional labor of correcting people who are making them uncomfortable.\n\nIt's the sister's job to teach her kid what is socially acceptable and maybe sometimes OP can contribute to that (as part of their 'village') but asking OP to push through all of the pain in that moment to have a conversation with that child about it is overwhelming, taxing, and not appropriate.

Engage with the fat community and fat activists even if just virtually. Learn that your weight does not mean you get to be treated worse than thin people. Weight is dependent on so many things and some are outside of your control. Listen to the podcast Maintenance Phase.

Being fat in a vacuum isn't a reason to stop living and it's structural problems with society that are driving you into isolation, not problems with you.", "Right, but that doesn't mean she can't be taught.

Basically: niece gets a pass because she's young and hasn't learned better yet, but she does need to learn that commenting on someone's weight in this manner is very embarrassing to most people.", "Saying that OP smells bad because OP is so fat is rude.

I sure as shit would if I heard you telling someone that."]}
