No texture aversion, etc, just super fussy. \n\nThe only child I've even known who didn't eat peas, corn, baked beans or carrots, onions, any green vegetables at all apart from cabbage, only ate potatoes if they were mashed. It drove me mental because my family is super mixed so I was raised on rendang curry, Indonesian satay or whole baked spicy fish, etc. \n\nNo matter how tiny the pieces were, he'd pick every single piece of onion out of Bolognese! If it wasn't so frustrating, it would have been impressive.\n\nI started not *tricking* him but altering how he saw veggies. \n\nInstead of mashed potatoes, I'd grate cheese into the already mashed potatoes and fry up potato cakes, topped each cake with a runny fried egg. Boom, you have \"Monster Eye Cakes\"\n\nI grated carrots into tomato soup. I made \"Freaky Fritters\" which were really just homemade veggie burgers but I added blue or green food colouring before I formed the patties to make them adequately ghoulish looking for a young boy. I'd draw a creepy \"bloody mouth\" on the patties with ketchup too.\n\n\"Shrek Soup\" was pea soup with whizzed up spinach, broccoli, courgette, any greens I could get into him BUT I added chicken stock and some shredded chicken so he could TASTE the chicken and knew there was cabbage in it, that's why it was green. \n\nSneaky as hell but hey, it worked!", "It helps me manage the freezer and it's fun too. The kids love the randomness of it all. \n\nYou want a giant spring roll, a burger patty, some buttered corn and some gy\u014dza? Go for it!", "I have to do it because of my acid reflux! Tons of reasons that smaller meals / snacks throughout the day just works for some people.", "I\u2019ll always sit with everyone, I just always have to take home a box if we go out. It\u2019s kinda awkward to explain if it\u2019s a first interaction but I\u2019ve never had someone get upset about it. I\u2019m just happy to be included \ud83d\ude02", "Dude you\u2019re seriously fucking amazing", "It\u2019s better, anyway, so we don\u2019t overeat at mealtimes.", "I understand.  I wouldn\u2019t want you to make yourself sick just to make me comfortable.", "That's super sweet of you to say! I've been with my partner 13years now and the youngest stepchild is 17 but I still worry if I'm doing enough for them as a parent, I still worry that I could do better for them. \n\nThey're happy and healthy though, they also actually TALK to us which I love.", "Haha that's very sweet of you, I just got so upset seeing him get upset at dinner time because we NEVER made him eat anything, we never did that with any of them, but we did expect them to try one bite/piece of something they hadn't had in a while. \n\nWe never forced them to eat anything but I got burned out trying to do 3 or 4 different dinners that we had to put a limit on it. So if I was making say, satay and one out of the five of us didn't want it, well the options were\n\n- I do you a toastie sandwich\n- Pick n Mix dinner (a yoghurt, portions of cheese, fruit and some crackers)\n- A wrap or cereal. \n\nIt took a LOT of pressure off plus everyone was happy, if one kid didn't want stew, they just said they wanted a Pick n Mix and I'd pop together some grapes, some cheese, some Tuc crackers, a yoghurt or yoghurt drink and some apple and peanut butter bites. \n\nThankfully now there's very little they won't eat, none will touch fish, which is fine, more for me, and my stepdaughter hates anything with a strong tomato taste but that's grand."]}
