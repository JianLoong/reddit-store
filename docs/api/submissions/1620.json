Come dinnertime, my son and his friend both grabbed a sandwich. The friend finished his first sandwich and said he was still hungry but didn't want another. I asked if he wanted the other half of my salad, and he said no. I asked if he wanted some applesauce, yogurt, chips or hummus. No to all of that.\n\nFinally he took another sandwich and ate it and seemed satisfied. The boys played a little bit more, and then the mom picked my son's friend up. She texted me this morning asking what I made for dinner last night. I told her I made the boys sandwiches.\n\nShe said her son eats hot food for dinner, and she didn't realize I was so stingy. It's not about stinginess, it's about convenience. It's hard to get kids this age to sit down for a meal when they're excited about a playdate. With sandwiches, I don't have to worry about the food getting cold while trying to get them to eat, and if they run outside midway through the meal they can take their food with them.\n\nHer response was \"so you're not stingy, you're lazy.\" I feel that's unfair. I offered him other things. It's not like I said to eat sandwiches or starve. Is the expectation for playdates that overlap with mealtime to always include a complex hot meal? The kids were also snacking throughout their playdate, so I didn't think they would be hungry enough for a large meal, either.\n\nAnyway, this mom thinks I'm an asshole.

How the fuck were you supposed to know about his dinner diet. Besides 2 sandwiches is more than enough for dinner. If the kid needs something he will ask.

I love sandwiches! The other mom sounds horrible though (no sandwiches? I feel bad for her kid).", "NTA. Unless dietary requirements are discussed and agreed on before hand then it\u2019s your choice. Sandwiches are a great dinner anyway and you made sure he had another and offered other food.", "NTA.  This other mom sounds unnecessarily difficult.   I'd stop play dates with her kid or require that they don't overlap with meal times.", "Nobody's the Ahole.\n\n Lots of people find a sandwich uncommon for dinner.\n\n Parents are going to be upset when their child tells them they are hungry. \n\nMost parents would keep quiet, so I actually think it's good that this woman communicated the issue with you, although her anger about her kid being hungry all night made it more rude than it should have been.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
