No texture aversion, etc, just super fussy. \n\nThe only child I've even known who didn't eat peas, corn, baked beans or carrots, onions, any green vegetables at all apart from cabbage, only ate potatoes if they were mashed. It drove me mental because my family is super mixed so I was raised on rendang curry, Indonesian satay or whole baked spicy fish, etc. \n\nNo matter how tiny the pieces were, he'd pick every single piece of onion out of Bolognese! If it wasn't so frustrating, it would have been impressive.\n\nI started not *tricking* him but altering how he saw veggies. \n\nInstead of mashed potatoes, I'd grate cheese into the already mashed potatoes and fry up potato cakes, topped each cake with a runny fried egg. Boom, you have \"Monster Eye Cakes\"\n\nI grated carrots into tomato soup. I made \"Freaky Fritters\" which were really just homemade veggie burgers but I added blue or green food colouring before I formed the patties to make them adequately ghoulish looking for a young boy. I'd draw a creepy \"bloody mouth\" on the patties with ketchup too.\n\n\"Shrek Soup\" was pea soup with whizzed up spinach, broccoli, courgette, any greens I could get into him BUT I added chicken stock and some shredded chicken so he could TASTE the chicken and knew there was cabbage in it, that's why it was green. \n\nSneaky as hell but hey, it worked!", "It helps me manage the freezer and it's fun too.

So if I was making say, satay and one out of the five of us didn't want it, well the options were\n\n- I do you a toastie sandwich\n- Pick n Mix dinner (a yoghurt, portions of cheese, fruit and some crackers)\n- A wrap or cereal. \n\nIt took a LOT of pressure off plus everyone was happy, if one kid didn't want stew, they just said they wanted a Pick n Mix and I'd pop together some grapes, some cheese, some Tuc crackers, a yoghurt or yoghurt drink and some apple and peanut butter bites. \n\nThankfully now there's very little they won't eat, none will touch fish, which is fine, more for me, and my stepdaughter hates anything with a strong tomato taste but that's grand.", "Is this for real because if it is I wouldn\u2019t have that child anywhere near mine.", "NTA.
