For this reason, I usually make sandwiches on those nights. I pile them on a platter and use the leftover ones for lunches. It's easier to get the kids to eat, in my experience.\n\nWell, last night I made the usual playdate food for him and his friend and a salad for myself. Come dinnertime, my son and his friend both grabbed a sandwich. The friend finished his first sandwich and said he was still hungry but didn't want another. I asked if he wanted the other half of my salad, and he said no. I asked if he wanted some applesauce, yogurt, chips or hummus. No to all of that.\n\nFinally he took another sandwich and ate it and seemed satisfied. The boys played a little bit more, and then the mom picked my son's friend up. She texted me this morning asking what I made for dinner last night. I told her I made the boys sandwiches.\n\nShe said her son eats hot food for dinner, and she didn't realize I was so stingy. It's not about stinginess, it's about convenience. It's hard to get kids this age to sit down for a meal when they're excited about a playdate. With sandwiches, I don't have to worry about the food getting cold while trying to get them to eat, and if they run outside midway through the meal they can take their food with them.\n\nHer response was \"so you're not stingy, you're lazy.\" I feel that's unfair. I offered him other things. It's not like I said to eat sandwiches or starve. Is the expectation for playdates that overlap with mealtime to always include a complex hot meal? The kids were also snacking throughout their playdate, so I didn't think they would be hungry enough for a large meal, either.\n\nAnyway, this mom thinks I'm an asshole.

I have to say, i can\u2019t believe the audacity of that woman calling to complain about her kid being fed.

As they got older, I tried different things. The dinner that was the most fun was personal pizzas.

Mark this one off the friends list. The last thing I\u2019m going to do after a bunch of screaming kids running around is make a hot meal that has a 50/50 chance of being eaten.  Play date food is all about kid friendly and easy. Half the time I order pizza which I guess is hot food. Some people.", "The other mom is clearly the AH IMO! I would be appalled if I got that phone call from another mom expecting a hot meal. GTFO! OP is right that kids never sit still for an actual meal while on a play dates. In my house we also go with pizza, sandwiches, grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken nuggets, etc as meals eaten on play dates. There are zero hot meals being made for this occasion in my house. It is a waste of time *every single time*. \n\nThe kid wasn\u2019t hungry they were just entitled. When you send you kid to someone else\u2019s house you cannot expect it to be the same as your own house. Your kid follows their routines and their rules (within reason) until they come home. It\u2019s just the way it is.", "I think calling someone up to call someone cheap and lazy seems pretty ahish, not just \"different expectations\"", "That's why I called her rude."]}
