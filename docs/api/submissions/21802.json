Her class is very tight knit and we all get along well.  About a year ago the girls started a book club and meet up at different homes 2 times per month. My daughter was in it last summer but we had to stop when the school year began.  She\u2019s a competitive dancer which requires a lot of time.\n\n   Fast forward to 3 weeks ago.  We had a girl in her class over named Sarah.  Sarah asked my daughter if she was excited to attend Addy\u2019s, another girl in the class, birthday party.  She said it was a swimming party and they\u2019d be playing a movie on an outdoor screen.  My daughter hadn\u2019t received an invite.  When Sarah\u2019s mom came Sarah told her how we hadn\u2019t received an invite for Addy\u2019s birthday.\n\n  Sarah\u2019s mom said Addy had handed them out at the last book club and had probably just forgot to reach out.  She suggested I text Addy\u2019s mom.  I was hesitant at first because I do have strong feelings about inviting yourself to things.  I couldn\u2019t see a real reason why she wasn\u2019t invited since it was an at home party and every other girl was. \n\nI texted Addy\u2019s mom and reminded her my daughter hadn\u2019t been at the last book club and if she was also supposed to receive an invite.  She responded that they had hired someone to do a spa for the girls during the party and the service had a limit of 10 so they decided to only do the girls in book club.  She didn\u2019t expect us to find out.  I responded that I understood but felt it was wrong to not include just one.  I told my daughter we can\u2019t expect to be invited every time and this was just a life lesson.\n\nSarah\u2019s mom reached out to ask if I had sorted it out. I sent her a screenshot from the convo.  She didn\u2019t respond for a few days but when she did she told me she had decided Sarah wouldn\u2019t attend.  She felt it was wrong to not include just one child and she could see if our kids didn\u2019t get along or had drama but that wasn\u2019t the case.  They hired someone knowing just one girl would be left out and she didn\u2019t agree with it. \n\nI get a text from Addy\u2019s mom a week later that a total of 4 girls were not attending.  She felt I had ruined her daughters party and was creating drama.  I explained that I had no intentions of ruining her party and had only spoken to one other mom about it. \n\nI talked to my own mom about it who agreed I should not have texted Addy\u2019s mom and if they had wanted us we would have been invited.\n\nThe only mom I talked to about it was Sarah\u2019s which I assume is who told others. I never meant to cause others to not attend or ruin a child\u2019s party.  When I reached out I really felt like it must have been a mistake since she was the only one.  Now I\u2019m unsure if I was just a jerk who now cause unnecessary drama in a small group and possibly ruined a child\u2019s party.\n\nWas I the AH?\n\nEdit: my daughter does still attend book club once per month to once every other month. She didn\u2019t totally leave. She\u2019s just not a full time member.", "created_utc": 1688942679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vc9yk/aita_for_trying_to_invite_my_daughter_to_someones/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not unreasonable to think in a group that small everyone would have received an invitation. But some food for thought\u2026\n\nNot invited? Don\u2019t go. \n\nNot told? Don\u2019t ask. \n\nLate invite? Decline, you were never a part of the plan", "NTA. Addy's mom knows there are 11 girls in the class and decided to go for the activity limited by not including one girl in. That's where the drama is caused. Of course you daughter would have found out - or if not, this would have caused the other girls to isolate her in general by keeping secrets from her. You trying to find out why she hasn't received an invitation is a normal thing. Sara's mom following up on your conversation shows she is concerned that your daughter seems to be left out. Her deciding to rally other moms or explain to other moms why her daughter will skip the party is not your decision, it's hers.\n\nAnother person said you made a bad choice by sending a screenshot of the conversation, because it was a private conversation - I don't agree with that. You were one of the parties of that conversation. You might have as well \"retold\" what Addy's mom said to Sara's mom, for everyone with phone nowadays it is clear that screenshot is much easier way to transfer that information.", "NTA - you don't exclude one kid from a party, it's unnecessarily cruel. Have only 6 sure, 10 of 11 no, and they shouldn't be surprised it's had consequences.", "NTA\n \nits completely normal to want your kids not to be left alone or rejected\n\nAnd you didnt porpusefully send the screenshot just to make a drama..it was just responding to a question someone asked you thats it (but sending the screenshot of a private conversation to someone else is a mistake so watch out next time)\n\nAnd also you didnt make those 4 girls parents to decide to not make their daughters attend \nSo you did nothing wrong\n\nAnd you also taught your daughter than she will not be invited sometimes and that's something that happens and its fine and that is great parenting", "NTA. You didn't intentionally set out to make the other moms back out, you simply shared why it limited to 10 children with ONE other mom. If she felt the hosts choices didn't align with her she has every right to keep her child home. I would have done the same. I wouldn't want my child to be apart of something that was excluding someone else. Not a lesson I want to teach my child. I also find it hard to believe that they couldn't  ask if it would be possible to pay an extra fee to include one other child. If it was 15 kids instead of 10 I could see it being a hard and fast no but 11 instead of 10 shouldn't rock the boat much imo. \n\nIdk why everyone is hating on you sharing a screenshot, typing out \"she hired a service that could only accommodate 10 kids\" is the exact same as sending what she herself said as long as the shot didn't include any other information.", "NTA. \n\nI was ready with my finger on the 'Y', but everything you did was perfectly reasonable.  You asked a reasonable question when you found out your daughter was excluded.  You didn't argue; you accepted the answer even though it was plainly wrong.  Obviously others saw that this is a hair's breadth away from bullying - and it wasn't even the kid doing it!", "NTA. You literally did nothing wrong. Your daughter heard about the party from Sarah. She told Sarah she was not invited. Sarah told her mum. Sarah\u2019s mum suggested you text Addy\u2019s mum. I think asking was reasonable because it was extremely possible that Addy just hadn\u2019t recalled to give the invite not in book club. \n\nWhen Sarah\u2019s mum asked for an update what were you supposed to say? Any lie I can think of just makes it sound worse. You just told her what you were informed - you even sent the exact screenshot of a text. You didn\u2019t paraphrase or make it sound worse. You literally provided it verbatim. If other people want to drop out that is their prerogative. You didn\u2019t even tell them what was happening!\n\nEdit: okay wait after reading these other responses saying sending the screenshot makes you an AH - I am so confused. In my mind paraphrasing Addy\u2019s mum\u2019s text would be worse. Sending the screenshot just ensures no bias. Sarah\u2019s mum is getting the exact reason.", "Nta, they got to know your daughter would find out as little girls talk which is unfair given they were knowingly excluding you \nIf others decided not to go that's their decision", "NTA.  You didn't stir the pot on this one.  And for reference, excluding one girl out of the whole class is a dick move.", "NTA\n\nAddy\u2019s mom is a garbage person for excluding one girl from the class.  I see no problem with your exposing her behavior.  \n\nSarah, and the other girls who didn\u2019t go to the party (as well as their parents) are stand up people.", "NTA. You didn't act as a helicopter parent, you didn't whine or complain to other parents or promote it from your daughter. Hell, you tried to turn this into a life lesson for your daughter. You acted a lot more calmly and rationally than 90% of people on this sub would have. \n\nSome people might not be pleased about you sending a screenshot of the text, and to some extent I get the thought behind that. But this wasn't some deeply personal communication or even gossip. Unless something isn't being said here, it sounds like all you did was send the screenshot instead of quoting verbatim what was said. It wasn't sent unprompted, and the same result would have happened if you'd typed out an explanation. \n\nIs it slightly an AH move to not invite one person? Maybe, but if that one person isn't as involved in the group and it wasn't done on purpose, just necessity due to circumstance, that kind of thing just happens sometimes in life. Just do your best not to get caught in the drama that will likely unfold from here and make sure you're listening to and looking out for your daughter, as the friend group and its dynamic is ultimately going to affect her more than it affects you!", "NTA when only one kid is left out I\u2019d be pretty interested in knowing why myself: was it an accident? We\u2019re there any disputes between the kids i as a parent didn\u2019t know about? Had I or my so done something to piss the other parents of and that was why? \n\nYou\u2019d need to know to fix any problems. And if the other person sees no problem excluding you kid they should also have no problem telling you so or why. \n\nAnd the other parents pulled out because they could see that it was a d move on the birthday throwers part. Plus if they could do it once who\u2019s to say it wouldn\u2019t be their kid randomly excluded next time the nr didn\u2019t agree? \n\nAs for the screenshots, honestly it was the best way of making sure there was no misunderstanding and no \u2018he said she said\u2019 later on.", "NTA", "ESH.  Not inviting one girl in a class and expecting no one to find out is really, really dumb.  They reason I didn\u2019t go NTA is twofold.  1 - they are 9, and at that age friendships become more complex.  Your daughter will need to learn that she will not always be included, and conversely, that it\u2019s ok to not include everyone in things she does.  With better communication this shouldn\u2019t be an issue.  2 - sending someone the screenshot of the conversation with the birthday girls mom is a AH move that is also pretty much guaranteed to start drama.", "NTA they excluded 1 girl from the class. That\u2019s messed up. You also didn\u2019t tell anyone to not go, you simply told the truth when asked. Addy\u2019s mom screwed up big time. Adding one more kid can\u2019t possibly have been that difficult.", "Nta *but* Sarah's mom is a shitstirrer.", "While it is unfortunate that they couldn't host everyone, it happens. Many birthday activities have a limit of 10 people so the birthday child picks their 9 closest friends and sometimes people can't be invited. It's tacky to ask why your child wasn't invited, hell maybe the other girl's mom simply doesn't like your child, that's perfectly fair, they're allowed to invite whomever they want to their events.\n\nOn the one hand, you only spoke with one other mom so it's not your fault others declined due to one child being left out. On the other handem, you should ahve simply explained to your child that sometimes there isn't room to invite everyone. \n\nMy 8 year old has a large group of friends, naturally she's closer to some of the group than others. Sometimes she's invited to the parties and sometimes she isn't since the limit meant not being able to include everyone. It's the same for her parties, some years the venue has no limit or the limit is high enough to include everyone, other times it's not.", "> we all get along well\n\n> we had to stop when the school year began\n\n\nWhy are you keep saying we? Are you also in her class? \n\n\nNTA. They have the right not to invite you, and you have the right to tell other information. Others have the right not to attend.", "You texted a screenshot of a private conversation to someone else. Was it really necessary to do that? \n\nYour daughter isn't in the book club because of another activity. That's fine, but you really can't expect her to be involved in things that are occurring with a group that meets regularly and your daughter isn't involved in.  \n\nYTA", "> She felt it was wrong to not include just one child and she could see if our kids didn\u2019t get along or had drama but that wasn\u2019t the case.\n> Now I\u2019m unsure if I was just a jerk who now cause unnecessary drama in a small group \n\nI don\u2019t think you had any bad intentions, but you also sent a screen shot.

She didn\u2019t expect us to find out.  I responded that I understood but felt it was wrong to not include just one.\n\nYTA & so is Sarah's mom for so many reason in my opinion. Mainly neither you nor Sarah's mom were planning or paying for this event. The mom explained she booked an activity for her daughter's party that had a limit on the number people who could attend. So your response of how it was wrong was completely out of line. Is this woman not supposed to plan activities for her daughter if your's cannot attend? You have no idea what her budget was either. Maybe she could only afford the spa package for 10 people. It was not your place to comment on who is invited to HER daughter's party. Then you shared  private text message wtih Sarah's mom that caused drama. What you did was unnecessary and in bad taste.", "YTA\n\nIf you have your daughter only occasionally showing up for a group activity that meets regularly, you can't expect anyone to take her seriously as a member of the group.  This group meets twice a month, she's showing up maybe 1/4 to 1/2 the time.  \n\nThat's pretty obnoxious.  She's not showing up enough to be involved with the ongoing discussion of books, and trying to catch her up on the discussion is going to disrupt it for everyone.\n\nYou, and your daughter, are treating this book club and friends group as a distant second place to her competitive dance.  That's your choice.  But you can't treat this group and her friends as second-place to competitive dance and still expect them to consider her a full member of their group. \n\nIs competitive dance something your daughter enjoys enough to be putting it ahead of time with her school friends and participating in their social activities?  \n\nIf the dance is leaving her socially isolated and making her an outsider in her own school, she could easily come to resent it rather than enjoy it.  \n\nYou need to have ongoing conversation with your daughter about how the competitive dance affects her larger life, and if it is worth the trade-offs ***to her***.  She's a kid, no competitive activity is more important than letting her be a kid, with friends and school.  Find a balance that lets her enjoy her school social life as well as the dance.", "ESH except Addy's mom and the kids. So I guess just you and Sarah's mom. You made a choice to remove your kid from the book club. Every choice has consequences. Because she's less involved in the groups lives she's understandably being included less.\n\nYou ruined a child's birthday because of this.

We are part of small school community and that ish isn\u2019t ok.\n\nBut OP - screenshoting a private convo in a passive-aggressive way? Not ok.

Not only that but it\u2019s completely fair that OP wanted to know why their daughter didn\u2019t get an invited as those girls are also in her class not just in the book club and OP\u2019s daughter still attends the book club but does it once a month so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to call OP selfish for expecting an invite for their daughter, so imo OP is NTA but Sarah\u2019s mom is.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have texted the screenshot in the first place, you created the drama.\n\nOn the other hand it really is kind of mean to ostracize one girl. One girl could have just sat out of the spa but still attended the party.", "YTA but also not. It is rude to exclude one but also expensive.

Meaning, you should be saying \u201cdon\u2019t not go because of me.\u201d Passing out invitations is awkward and stressful as a kid. As a personal aside- one time a girl passed out birthday party invitations at school and my best friend asked me if I had gotten mine because she had literally seen it. Never got it. Never heard about the party after. Wondered about it because no, I don\u2019t think my friend was insensitive or lying (it was likely bc of class change and us not being friends but just classmates so it wasnt important to redistribute who she missed) but it wasn\u2019t the end of the world. I have never held beef nor asked but I still wonder sometimes and laugh, like right now.

You can't manage her way back into a birthday party.", "i think you acted completely above board. i can see why it must have seemed like an oversight just because she missed the book club, not like anything else.  i applaud other parents from holding back their daughters from what was a rude way of dismissing your daughter.  yes, on occasion you won\u2019t be invited to parties and that is a life lesson, but this appeared to be a simple oversight so inquiring about it made complete sense. as for ruining the party, i think the mom did that by treating your daughter as disposable", "NTA I organized a dozen b day parties for my daughter and it\u2019s in extremely poor taste to exclude just one person. Addy\u2019s mom is TAH for excluding one and then telling you she purposely did it because she didn\u2019t think you or your daughter would know? Is she stupid? Kids talk. Social media is a thing. I would be so mad and do what Sarah\u2019s mom did. I\u2019d pull my kid out. \n\nYou were perfectly okay to ask if the invitation was missed. Kids lose things or assume the parents know. Better to ask than to show up. Kids look to parents to learn right from wrong and Addy\u2019s mom is displaying some disappointing behavior.", "NTA.

She thinks kids don\u2019t talk to each other?", "Methinks that something about her daughter being a \u201ccompetitive dancer\u201d might play a part in the story\u2026", "First one I\u2019m with you on, but the later two are some toxic, self-hating shit. Gosh.", "Disagree on the late invite one. Sometimes there just isn't enough space initially, but someone that can't make it frees up space to allow someone else you would have invited had the limit been higher. As long as it's done within a close timeframe of the invites going out to begin with, there's nothing wrong with including someone else in place of someone that can't make it.", "Totally agree that Addy\u2019s mom created the drama the moment she chose to leave just one child out. I can\u2019t help but feel there\u2019s an untold, mean-spirited reason behind it; I just can\u2019t imagine any mom thinking this was an acceptable idea. I would *never* do something this unkind to a kid this age.", "It's also gives an objective report, instead of an objective one.", "Exactly. Not being invited to everything is just a life lesson but if there\u2019s 11 girls in the class and 10 of them go to the party that\u2019s just shitty. She\u2019s going to find out eventually.", "As far as I know Addy\u2019s mom has, well had, no issue with us.  Addy slept over at our home many times during the school year.  We hadn\u2019t seen them this summer but that was due to Addy attending camp and they had a family vacation.  It wasn\u2019t due to not wanting her over. There was no issues between us as far as I knew.\n\nWe have had 2 of the children not attending her party over for a play date in the last week.  We\u2019ve also seen a few other classmates that are attending.  None of the parents mentioned anything regarding party and I didn\u2019t either.  The only reason I found out who had decided not to attend due to my daughter not being invited was because Addy\u2019s mom gave me names in her text.  I can\u2019t say what is being said amongst other parents but outside of Sarah and Addy\u2019s moms nobody has said a word to me about it.  There\u2019s been no real gossip about it as far as I know.", "No in the edit OP said her daughter still attends the book club but only does it once a month? So it\u2019s perfectly normal and reasonable for OP to expect her daughter to get an invite. And the girls are all in her class even without the book club.", "It's all the other girls in her grade at school. It is not a random group of girls that meet elsewhere. She sees these girls every day.", "Whether you text the screenshot, quote verbatim, or just summarize the reason the daughter wasn't invited, the result would be the same. Not sure what about the screenshot makes it stand out, much less make someone the A H", "What specifically does a screenshot do that makes it worse than just explaining in any other way? Seems a weird thing to specifically latch onto", "im confused how is sending a screenshot of the conversation suddenly ruining things? Sarah\u2019s mom is in the fault here she\u2019s the one who gossiped to other moms about it so it\u2019s her fault and her decision that caused things where it would go i don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blame OP for that as OP only shared it to one person and didn\u2019t gossip about it to like multiple people.", "My daughter is with her school friends nearly every weekend during the school year.  During summer she takes off from dance and is with different school friends nearly every day.  The only reason book club was even mentioned is because that is how the invites were sent out.  She has been to every single birthday party the class has had and is invited to different friends homes on a weekly basis during the school year.  In summer we have kids in our home or she\u2019s invited out with friends daily.  Her dance is not limiting her friend time, simply making her unable to attend every book club which is held a random nights and some of those nights she has dance class. Also book club is usually discussing a book for maybe 30 minutes with the rest of the time just hanging out and playing.  It\u2019s not a formal event.", "On the contrary, Addy and Addy\u2019s mom at least suck. Can\u2019t really vouch for OP\u2019s daughter, but Addy sounds like a Mean Girl.", "Everyone knows about screenshots now. If you don't want your responses to be shared, you should call. You can't expect text messages to be private anymore.", "The parents still would have felt it was rude to exclude one girl from their class.", ">I was leaning towards you being the AH, because you signed up your daughter for many other activities,\n\nYikes, I'm an A H parent if my kid does competitive dance and also wants to do things with friends at school?", "Yeah, I\u2019ve seen Dancemoms! \ud83d\ude02", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s self-loathing. It\u2019s self-respect.", "And if the spa is a limit if ten, then you choose another activity  that doesn't  leave one girl out", "But why did she need to report the conversation at all? She could have just said oh space was limited, maybe next time. She created a bunch of drama amongst the mothers over a simple birthday invite. \n\nI have a 9 year old. You just explain that you're not always included in everything and sometimes other people are hanging out without you. There are other parties and hang outs. She isn't being excluded every time.", "It\u2019s really crappy of them to basically go \u2018rock, paper, scissors\u2019 on who gets excluded instead of finding something else to do or simply paying a bit extra to get another kid included. \n\nHeck they could have simply sent out a note with the invites, or called/texted the parents that because they were hiring this person they would need to put on a small fee to include everybody because they normally only took on 10 people and there were 11 girls total. \n\nI remember we had that happen a couple of times. If everyone could agree to pay (it was something like 3-5$) each then the party would get to go horse riding, or swimming if not that was fine and it would just be a regular kids birthday party.", "Yeah.\nJust because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should though.\n\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to believe a conversation between two people remains between two.", "Exactly.  That\u2019s what makes the screenshots an ah move.  If OP had not done that, everyone would have still seen the bs birthday girl\u2019s mom was dishing out, but in a less drama filled way.  The second you are sending receipts as \u2018evidence\u2019 you have entered the ESH zone.", "Yep. If you get a late invite, to a limited space event, someone else canceled... just decline", "No, the post literally states it\u2019s because they think they weren\u2019t meant to be a part of it. That\u2019s not pride, that\u2019s self deprecation.\n\nIf you want to live like that, feel free, but it\u2019s hella toxic advice to spread around.", "I feel like Sarah\u2019s mum, knowing this was a bday party at a house, would have asked \u201cwhat do you mean limited? How does she not have room for one other girl? All 11 girls have been in the house before, clearly they fit inside this house. How does a bday party for a girl with 10 friends have a limit of 9 when it\u2019s at her house?\u201d", "Well, that's essentially the message that sending the screenshot showed: space is limited to 10, and one girl will have to miss this time. That's it. Maybe the other mom did overreact or could have talked this out without boycotting the party. We don't know, that's potentially not on OP. All OP did was tell the truth, and it is indeed normal to ask about why one child can't be included. That's probably information a mom should have, ESPECIALLY if there are other events where she will actually be sending her daughter with these people. The fact that the party was supposed to be a secret adds a layer to this. It's not missing one event- it's a secret event. I'd be like \"what do you mean you didn't think I would find out about your daughter's birthday, this is silly.\" Red flags are going off, and they're not from anything OP did here. All I know is there's more to the story.", ">hiring this person they would need to put on a small fee to include everybody\n\nWhen you're a host, you pay for the entertainment.  Asking for a small fee to attend a children's party is gross.  If you can't afford the spa treatment for everyone, then you do something else.", "I agree with you. \n\nJust because it's unreasonable doesn't mean it should be unexpected. People suck.", "If someone doesn\u2019t want me at their party I certainly don\u2019t need to beg them. There\u2019s nothing toxic about *not inviting yourself to other people\u2019s parties.*", "\u201cPeople suck.\u201d\n\nYep - agreed.\n\nHence my ESH vote.", "No one said to beg. This very well couldve been an honest mistake since she wasnt at book club and you dont know unless you ask. Why build a fictional boogey man in your head.", "Nah I don\u2019t think that in a class with 11 girls you manage to invite all but one.\n\nAnd when it was brought to her attention the mom gave some BS about a \u201ckeeping it at 10 for a spa day.\u201d", "But it wasn't an honest mistake. And frankly, they almost never are."]}
