Her class is very tight knit and we all get along well.  About a year ago the girls started a book club and meet up at different homes 2 times per month. My daughter was in it last summer but we had to stop when the school year began.  She\u2019s a competitive dancer which requires a lot of time.\n\n   Fast forward to 3 weeks ago.  We had a girl in her class over named Sarah.  Sarah asked my daughter if she was excited to attend Addy\u2019s, another girl in the class, birthday party.  She said it was a swimming party and they\u2019d be playing a movie on an outdoor screen.  My daughter hadn\u2019t received an invite.  When Sarah\u2019s mom came Sarah told her how we hadn\u2019t received an invite for Addy\u2019s birthday.\n\n  Sarah\u2019s mom said Addy had handed them out at the last book club and had probably just forgot to reach out.  She suggested I text Addy\u2019s mom.  I was hesitant at first because I do have strong feelings about inviting yourself to things.  I couldn\u2019t see a real reason why she wasn\u2019t invited since it was an at home party and every other girl was. \n\nI texted Addy\u2019s mom and reminded her my daughter hadn\u2019t been at the last book club and if she was also supposed to receive an invite.  She responded that they had hired someone to do a spa for the girls during the party and the service had a limit of 10 so they decided to only do the girls in book club.  She didn\u2019t expect us to find out.  I responded that I understood but felt it was wrong to not include just one.  I told my daughter we can\u2019t expect to be invited every time and this was just a life lesson.\n\nSarah\u2019s mom reached out to ask if I had sorted it out. I sent her a screenshot from the convo.  She didn\u2019t respond for a few days but when she did she told me she had decided Sarah wouldn\u2019t attend.  She felt it was wrong to not include just one child and she could see if our kids didn\u2019t get along or had drama but that wasn\u2019t the case.  They hired someone knowing just one girl would be left out and she didn\u2019t agree with it. \n\nI get a text from Addy\u2019s mom a week later that a total of 4 girls were not attending.  She felt I had ruined her daughters party and was creating drama.  I explained that I had no intentions of ruining her party and had only spoken to one other mom about it. \n\nI talked to my own mom about it who agreed I should not have texted Addy\u2019s mom and if they had wanted us we would have been invited.\n\nThe only mom I talked to about it was Sarah\u2019s which I assume is who told others. I never meant to cause others to not attend or ruin a child\u2019s party.  When I reached out I really felt like it must have been a mistake since she was the only one.  Now I\u2019m unsure if I was just a jerk who now cause unnecessary drama in a small group and possibly ruined a child\u2019s party.\n\nWas I the AH?\n\nEdit: my daughter does still attend book club once per month to once every other month. She didn\u2019t totally leave. She\u2019s just not a full time member.", "created_utc": 1688942679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vc9yk/aita_for_trying_to_invite_my_daughter_to_someones/", "score": 701, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not unreasonable to think in a group that small everyone would have received an invitation. But some food for thought\u2026\n\nNot invited? Don\u2019t go. \n\nNot told? Don\u2019t ask. \n\nLate invite? Decline, you were never a part of the plan", "NTA. Addy's mom knows there are 11 girls in the class and decided to go for the activity limited by not including one girl in. That's where the drama is caused. Of course you daughter would have found out - or if not, this would have caused the other girls to isolate her in general by keeping secrets from her. You trying to find out why she hasn't received an invitation is a normal thing. Sara's mom following up on your conversation shows she is concerned that your daughter seems to be left out. Her deciding to rally other moms or explain to other moms why her daughter will skip the party is not your decision, it's hers.\n\nAnother person said you made a bad choice by sending a screenshot of the conversation, because it was a private conversation - I don't agree with that. You were one of the parties of that conversation. You might have as well \"retold\" what Addy's mom said to Sara's mom, for everyone with phone nowadays it is clear that screenshot is much easier way to transfer that information.", "NTA - you don't exclude one kid from a party, it's unnecessarily cruel. Have only 6 sure, 10 of 11 no, and they shouldn't be surprised it's had consequences.", "NTA\n \nits completely normal to want your kids not to be left alone or rejected\n\nAnd you didnt porpusefully send the screenshot just to make a drama..it was just responding to a question someone asked you thats it (but sending the screenshot of a private conversation to someone else is a mistake so watch out next time)\n\nAnd also you didnt make those 4 girls parents to decide to not make their daughters attend \nSo you did nothing wrong\n\nAnd you also taught your daughter than she will not be invited sometimes and that's something that happens and its fine and that is great parenting", "NTA. You didn't intentionally set out to make the other moms back out, you simply shared why it limited to 10 children with ONE other mom. If she felt the hosts choices didn't align with her she has every right to keep her child home. I would have done the same. I wouldn't want my child to be apart of something that was excluding someone else. Not a lesson I want to teach my child. I also find it hard to believe that they couldn't  ask if it would be possible to pay an extra fee to include one other child. If it was 15 kids instead of 10 I could see it being a hard and fast no but 11 instead of 10 shouldn't rock the boat much imo. \n\nIdk why everyone is hating on you sharing a screenshot, typing out \"she hired a service that could only accommodate 10 kids\" is the exact same as sending what she herself said as long as the shot didn't include any other information.", "NTA. \n\nI was ready with my finger on the 'Y', but everything you did was perfectly reasonable.  You asked a reasonable question when you found out your daughter was excluded.  You didn't argue; you accepted the answer even though it was plainly wrong.  Obviously others saw that this is a hair's breadth away from bullying - and it wasn't even the kid doing it!", "NTA. You literally did nothing wrong. Your daughter heard about the party from Sarah. She told Sarah she was not invited. Sarah told her mum. Sarah\u2019s mum suggested you text Addy\u2019s mum. I think asking was reasonable because it was extremely possible that Addy just hadn\u2019t recalled to give the invite not in book club. \n\nWhen Sarah\u2019s mum asked for an update what were you supposed to say? Any lie I can think of just makes it sound worse. You just told her what you were informed - you even sent the exact screenshot of a text. You didn\u2019t paraphrase or make it sound worse. You literally provided it verbatim. If other people want to drop out that is their prerogative. You didn\u2019t even tell them what was happening!\n\nEdit: okay wait after reading these other responses saying sending the screenshot makes you an AH - I am so confused. In my mind paraphrasing Addy\u2019s mum\u2019s text would be worse. Sending the screenshot just ensures no bias. Sarah\u2019s mum is getting the exact reason.", "Nta, they got to know your daughter would find out as little girls talk which is unfair given they were knowingly excluding you \nIf others decided not to go that's their decision", "NTA.  You didn't stir the pot on this one.  And for reference, excluding one girl out of the whole class is a dick move.", "NTA\n\nAddy\u2019s mom is a garbage person for excluding one girl from the class.  I see no problem with your exposing her behavior.  \n\nSarah, and the other girls who didn\u2019t go to the party (as well as their parents) are stand up people.", "NTA. You didn't act as a helicopter parent, you didn't whine or complain to other parents or promote it from your daughter. Hell, you tried to turn this into a life lesson for your daughter. You acted a lot more calmly and rationally than 90% of people on this sub would have. \n\nSome people might not be pleased about you sending a screenshot of the text, and to some extent I get the thought behind that. But this wasn't some deeply personal communication or even gossip. Unless something isn't being said here, it sounds like all you did was send the screenshot instead of quoting verbatim what was said. It wasn't sent unprompted, and the same result would have happened if you'd typed out an explanation. \n\nIs it slightly an AH move to not invite one person? Maybe, but if that one person isn't as involved in the group and it wasn't done on purpose, just necessity due to circumstance, that kind of thing just happens sometimes in life. Just do your best not to get caught in the drama that will likely unfold from here and make sure you're listening to and looking out for your daughter, as the friend group and its dynamic is ultimately going to affect her more than it affects you!", "NTA when only one kid is left out I\u2019d be pretty interested in knowing why myself: was it an accident? We\u2019re there any disputes between the kids i as a parent didn\u2019t know about? Had I or my so done something to piss the other parents of and that was why? \n\nYou\u2019d need to know to fix any problems. And if the other person sees no problem excluding you kid they should also have no problem telling you so or why. \n\nAnd the other parents pulled out because they could see that it was a d move on the birthday throwers part. Plus if they could do it once who\u2019s to say it wouldn\u2019t be their kid randomly excluded next time the nr didn\u2019t agree? \n\nAs for the screenshots, honestly it was the best way of making sure there was no misunderstanding and no \u2018he said she said\u2019 later on.", "NTA", "ESH.  Not inviting one girl in a class and expecting no one to find out is really, really dumb.  They reason I didn\u2019t go NTA is twofold.  1 - they are 9, and at that age friendships become more complex.  Your daughter will need to learn that she will not always be included, and conversely, that it\u2019s ok to not include everyone in things she does.  With better communication this shouldn\u2019t be an issue.  2 - sending someone the screenshot of the conversation with the birthday girls mom is a AH move that is also pretty much guaranteed to start drama.", "NTA they excluded 1 girl from the class. That\u2019s messed up. You also didn\u2019t tell anyone to not go, you simply told the truth when asked. Addy\u2019s mom screwed up big time. Adding one more kid can\u2019t possibly have been that difficult.", "Nta *but* Sarah's mom is a shitstirrer.", "While it is unfortunate that they couldn't host everyone, it happens. Many birthday activities have a limit of 10 people so the birthday child picks their 9 closest friends and sometimes people can't be invited. It's tacky to ask why your child wasn't invited, hell maybe the other girl's mom simply doesn't like your child, that's perfectly fair, they're allowed to invite whomever they want to their events.\n\nOn the one hand, you only spoke with one other mom so it's not your fault others declined due to one child being left out. On the other handem, you should ahve simply explained to your child that sometimes there isn't room to invite everyone. \n\nMy 8 year old has a large group of friends, naturally she's closer to some of the group than others. Sometimes she's invited to the parties and sometimes she isn't since the limit meant not being able to include everyone. It's the same for her parties, some years the venue has no limit or the limit is high enough to include everyone, other times it's not.", "> we all get along well\n\n> we had to stop when the school year began\n\n\nWhy are you keep saying we? Are you also in her class? \n\n\nNTA. They have the right not to invite you, and you have the right to tell other information. Others have the right not to attend.", "You texted a screenshot of a private conversation to someone else. Was it really necessary to do that? \n\nYour daughter isn't in the book club because of another activity. That's fine, but you really can't expect her to be involved in things that are occurring with a group that meets regularly and your daughter isn't involved in.  \n\nYTA", "> She felt it was wrong to not include just one child and she could see if our kids didn\u2019t get along or had drama but that wasn\u2019t the case.\n> Now I\u2019m unsure if I was just a jerk who now cause unnecessary drama in a small group \n\nI don\u2019t think you had any bad intentions, but you also sent a screen shot.

She didn\u2019t expect us to find out.  I responded that I understood but felt it was wrong to not include just one.\n\nYTA & so is Sarah's mom for so many reason in my opinion. Mainly neither you nor Sarah's mom were planning or paying for this event. The mom explained she booked an activity for her daughter's party that had a limit on the number people who could attend. So your response of how it was wrong was completely out of line. Is this woman not supposed to plan activities for her daughter if your's cannot attend? You have no idea what her budget was either. Maybe she could only afford the spa package for 10 people. It was not your place to comment on who is invited to HER daughter's party. Then you shared  private text message wtih Sarah's mom that caused drama. What you did was unnecessary and in bad taste.", "YTA\n\nIf you have your daughter only occasionally showing up for a group activity that meets regularly, you can't expect anyone to take her seriously as a member of the group.  This group meets twice a month, she's showing up maybe 1/4 to 1/2 the time.  \n\nThat's pretty obnoxious.  She's not showing up enough to be involved with the ongoing discussion of books, and trying to catch her up on the discussion is going to disrupt it for everyone.\n\nYou, and your daughter, are treating this book club and friends group as a distant second place to her competitive dance.  That's your choice.  But you can't treat this group and her friends as second-place to competitive dance and still expect them to consider her a full member of their group. \n\nIs competitive dance something your daughter enjoys enough to be putting it ahead of time with her school friends and participating in their social activities?  \n\nIf the dance is leaving her socially isolated and making her an outsider in her own school, she could easily come to resent it rather than enjoy it.  \n\nYou need to have ongoing conversation with your daughter about how the competitive dance affects her larger life, and if it is worth the trade-offs ***to her***.  She's a kid, no competitive activity is more important than letting her be a kid, with friends and school.  Find a balance that lets her enjoy her school social life as well as the dance.", "ESH except Addy's mom and the kids. So I guess just you and Sarah's mom. You made a choice to remove your kid from the book club. Every choice has consequences. Because she's less involved in the groups lives she's understandably being included less.\n\nYou ruined a child's birthday because of this.

We are part of small school community and that ish isn\u2019t ok.\n\nBut OP - screenshoting a private convo in a passive-aggressive way? Not ok. Just answer the question yourself.  \u201cYeah we talked. Turns out the party entertainment had to be capped at 10 so [Jane] didn\u2019t get an invite.

Not only that but it\u2019s completely fair that OP wanted to know why their daughter didn\u2019t get an invited as those girls are also in her class not just in the book club and OP\u2019s daughter still attends the book club but does it once a month so it wouldn\u2019t make sense to call OP selfish for expecting an invite for their daughter, so imo OP is NTA but Sarah\u2019s mom is.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have texted the screenshot in the first place, you created the drama.\n\nOn the other hand it really is kind of mean to ostracize one girl. One girl could have just sat out of the spa but still attended the party.", "YTA but also not. It is rude to exclude one but also expensive.

Meaning, you should be saying \u201cdon\u2019t not go because of me.\u201d Passing out invitations is awkward and stressful as a kid. As a personal aside- one time a girl passed out birthday party invitations at school and my best friend asked me if I had gotten mine because she had literally seen it. Never got it. Never heard about the party after. Wondered about it because no, I don\u2019t think my friend was insensitive or lying (it was likely bc of class change and us not being friends but just classmates so it wasnt important to redistribute who she missed) but it wasn\u2019t the end of the world. I have never held beef nor asked but I still wonder sometimes and laugh, like right now.

You can't manage her way back into a birthday party.", "i think you acted completely above board. i can see why it must have seemed like an oversight just because she missed the book club, not like anything else.  i applaud other parents from holding back their daughters from what was a rude way of dismissing your daughter.  yes, on occasion you won\u2019t be invited to parties and that is a life lesson, but this appeared to be a simple oversight so inquiring about it made complete sense. as for ruining the party, i think the mom did that by treating your daughter as disposable", "NTA I organized a dozen b day parties for my daughter and it\u2019s in extremely poor taste to exclude just one person. Addy\u2019s mom is TAH for excluding one and then telling you she purposely did it because she didn\u2019t think you or your daughter would know? Is she stupid? Kids talk. Social media is a thing. I would be so mad and do what Sarah\u2019s mom did. I\u2019d pull my kid out. \n\nYou were perfectly okay to ask if the invitation was missed. Kids lose things or assume the parents know. Better to ask than to show up. Kids look to parents to learn right from wrong and Addy\u2019s mom is displaying some disappointing behavior.", "NTA.

If you think of a person as your best friend and then you find out you're not in their top 20 then sure, that sucks, but not being in someone's closest inner circle doesn't mean that the friendship isn't real. \n\nIf I got a late invitation to a party I might be disappointed in some cases that I wasn't a priority, or flattered in other cases to have been considered at all, but either way I would make the decision based on whether or not I thought I would enjoy attending, not whether or not I felt slighted by the timing of the invitation.", "If everyone acted like this, my parties would not have friends, my parties were always first family, then friends, there are always many circumstances.\r  \nIt is as if that person who is afraid of heights is offended because they were not invited to skydive, they are situations, there will always be more, if you were happy until you found out about a party, why are you unhappy now?", "Hey my friend couldn\u2019t go to the concert/game/etc. do you want to come?\n\nHey I didn\u2019t see you last week because you were on vacation, we\u2019re having a BBQ tomorrow if you want to come?\n\nHey a couple of our friends backed out so now is room for 2 more people at the campsite/vacation rental, its right on the lake in two week.  I\u2019d love to have you come along.\n\n\nNot everything is some huge melodrama. Sometimes there are limited spaces, sometimes people forget.  If you\u2019re going to be miserable don\u2019t go.", "Remember the aunt Mildred's of the world.\n\nYou have too invite them. But many rejoice when her hemorrhoids keep her home.\n\nWhen old Millie declines they can dance your invite you the box.", "That's a ridiculous way to view it. Some activities have ridiculously low caps on numbers, and sometimes it's truly just that simple that you have 8 close friends but can only invite 4 you have to just pick and it doesn't make the other's an after thought or lesser friends it is literally just that you had a limit. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Gonna disagree. I have literally loads of friends in different groups from different places; school, work, hobbies, family and such. I never play favorites and I very seldom prioritize one over the other. Except for things like parties or activities that involve me otherwise footing the bill. If I wanted to invite literally everyone I\u2019m really close to to a birthday event at a restaurant it\u2019d probably number close to 100. And unless you\u2019re gonna pay to reserve the whole restaurant for a whole evening and the food on top of that, not possible. Therefore my main criteria is I invite people who have invited me to things before, and often that takes up my budget. It\u2019s not always about \u201cbeing good enough\u201d it\u2019s about practicality and affordability sometimes too.", "Nah, most people are reasonable and can grasp that some times, there are limits in place and it's not a personal slight, and it doesn't mean they don't matter to us.", "I knew a lot of competitive dancers (I did dance for fun) and the majority of them were super sweet (nicer when not around the older dance girls, but still always nice)\n\nBeing in such a busy schedule at such a young age plus all the attention and hard work I feel like can either make the girls very nice or very stuck up,, I know the stereo type, but I have had a lot of good experiences with competitive dancers.", "That\u2019s how it is anywhere I\u2019ve worked\u2026only have to invite all of done through the school.", "Not in this case it's not shady. The information was not at all private, the information was shared in the most direct and objective way, and the information was solicited. Not shady at all here. This is what screenshots are literally for.", "Yeahh it usually is easier so I get it and people just shouldn't say things over text they don't want getting out.", "Eh, it's a weird enough situation OP shouldn't be interpreting for the other parents. I wouldn't want to try and explain the reasoning second hand either, which is what everyone telling OP not to screenshot is essentially asking her to do. It's not her job to put words in the mom's mouth for her or smooth it over for the other parents. Let the statement she was told stand on its own", "Then you have unrealistic expectations, and you need to grow up.", "Yes, I used to let my kids choose who they wanted to invite, and then I'd check the class lists - if there was one girl/ boy in the class not invited, I'd suggest inviting that one extra person, and it was never a problem. \n\nBut in our school, we generally had two or three classes per grade. As the kids went through school, and the classes changed each year, the invite list tended to be a bigger mix of some from my child's class, and one or two from the other classes in that grade. So nobody was left feeling \"why am I the only one not invited\".", "My daughter has attended a party like this in the past. The limit was set my the company providing the services. They set a limit to ensure all services could be completed, enough supplies were available and enough staff were assigned. \n\nWhen you have such a small group of girls that regularly spend time together, it does make me wonder by Addy's mom would choose an activity that would exclude 1 friend. They could have done a Mom daughter day or invited one friend for a spa day.", "I have, and they\u2019re just like you \ud83d\ude18. Be better.", "?", "While I generally agree that yes of you host you take on the responsibility of paying, It\u2019s absolutely fine to contact the parents and ask them if this is okay with them and if not no worries we have other plans that are fine and nobody will be shamed or named if they don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t pay. \n\nAsking for a small % of what the actual prize pr head is is not rude when it\u2019s asked In Advance and as an option not a requirement.\n\nIt\u2019s basically going \u201cI\u2019ll pay the meal if you pay the tip. Or we can just stay in and I cook.\u201d", "Pretty sure it's an adult way of looking at things when it comes to expecting privacy in conversations.  Then again, when I was in middle school, we said, this is an an a and b conversation, so you can c your way out of it. Which frankly applies to this entire post.", "It's possible that Addy didn't want to invite OP's daughter, so Mom thought this was a kind of back-up excuse if they found out. \"Oh, we would have invited you but there just wasn't enough space.\"\n\nIt's possible to decide not to invite someone to an event without actually making them feel excluded... but this is not how it's done.", "So let me get this straight,  because I said that I have seen this type of behavior in many women and that it is NOT OK, I am just like them...\n\nExplain that to me please. \n\nDo you even understand what internalized misogyny is? I don't think you do. It's a term referring to women who think men are smarter and better than women. In other words a woman who is a misogynist. I didn\u2019t say men can't be bullies or toxic. \n\nWhat I said was that this SPECIFIC behavior isn't a rarity in female social group and that this type of single out exclusion is toxic and it is. \n\nI didn't say you never see this behavior in men, only that I see it often in women.\n\nSo at risk of another down vote from you I'll leave it at this, if your going to pull out common phrases you keep hearing from social media, Google them first and understand what your accusing someone of.\n\nWhat baffles me is we are clearly on the same side here and don't think this toxic behavior is ok so why are you picking a fight about it?", "This is so tacky.", "Everyone should keep things private but expecting everyone to do it is highly unrealistic.", "True. But thats why you ask. Make them say it out loud. That way there is no \"what ifs\" or excuses on monday. They cant pretend after the fact and be like \"where were you, why didnt you come to the party\" etc etc", "But you dont know unless you ask. Clarity allows you to move forward with real information instead of speculation."]}
