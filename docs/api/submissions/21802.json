Her class is very tight knit and we all get along well.  About a year ago the girls started a book club and meet up at different homes 2 times per month. My daughter was in it last summer but we had to stop when the school year began.  She\u2019s a competitive dancer which requires a lot of time.\n\n   Fast forward to 3 weeks ago.  We had a girl in her class over named Sarah.  Sarah asked my daughter if she was excited to attend Addy\u2019s, another girl in the class, birthday party.  She said it was a swimming party and they\u2019d be playing a movie on an outdoor screen.  My daughter hadn\u2019t received an invite.  When Sarah\u2019s mom came Sarah told her how we hadn\u2019t received an invite for Addy\u2019s birthday.\n\n  Sarah\u2019s mom said Addy had handed them out at the last book club and had probably just forgot to reach out.  She suggested I text Addy\u2019s mom.  I was hesitant at first because I do have strong feelings about inviting yourself to things.  I couldn\u2019t see a real reason why she wasn\u2019t invited since it was an at home party and every other girl was. \n\nI texted Addy\u2019s mom and reminded her my daughter hadn\u2019t been at the last book club and if she was also supposed to receive an invite.  She responded that they had hired someone to do a spa for the girls during the party and the service had a limit of 10 so they decided to only do the girls in book club.  She didn\u2019t expect us to find out.  I responded that I understood but felt it was wrong to not include just one.  I told my daughter we can\u2019t expect to be invited every time and this was just a life lesson.\n\nSarah\u2019s mom reached out to ask if I had sorted it out. I sent her a screenshot from the convo.  She didn\u2019t respond for a few days but when she did she told me she had decided Sarah wouldn\u2019t attend.  She felt it was wrong to not include just one child and she could see if our kids didn\u2019t get along or had drama but that wasn\u2019t the case.  They hired someone knowing just one girl would be left out and she didn\u2019t agree with it. \n\nI get a text from Addy\u2019s mom a week later that a total of 4 girls were not attending.  She felt I had ruined her daughters party and was creating drama.  I explained that I had no intentions of ruining her party and had only spoken to one other mom about it. \n\nI talked to my own mom about it who agreed I should not have texted Addy\u2019s mom and if they had wanted us we would have been invited.\n\nThe only mom I talked to about it was Sarah\u2019s which I assume is who told others. I never meant to cause others to not attend or ruin a child\u2019s party.  When I reached out I really felt like it must have been a mistake since she was the only one.  Now I\u2019m unsure if I was just a jerk who now cause unnecessary drama in a small group and possibly ruined a child\u2019s party.\n\nWas I the AH?\n\nEdit: my daughter does still attend book club once per month to once every other month. She didn\u2019t totally leave. She\u2019s just not a full time member.", "created_utc": 1688942679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vc9yk/aita_for_trying_to_invite_my_daughter_to_someones/", "score": 3884, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not unreasonable to think in a group that small everyone would have received an invitation. But some food for thought\u2026\n\nNot invited? Don\u2019t go. \n\nNot told? Don\u2019t ask. \n\nLate invite? Decline, you were never a part of the plan", "NTA. Addy's mom knows there are 11 girls in the class and decided to go for the activity limited by not including one girl in. That's where the drama is caused. Of course you daughter would have found out - or if not, this would have caused the other girls to isolate her in general by keeping secrets from her. You trying to find out why she hasn't received an invitation is a normal thing. Sara's mom following up on your conversation shows she is concerned that your daughter seems to be left out. Her deciding to rally other moms or explain to other moms why her daughter will skip the party is not your decision, it's hers.\n\nAnother person said you made a bad choice by sending a screenshot of the conversation, because it was a private conversation - I don't agree with that. You were one of the parties of that conversation. You might have as well \"retold\" what Addy's mom said to Sara's mom, for everyone with phone nowadays it is clear that screenshot is much easier way to transfer that information.", "NTA - you don't exclude one kid from a party, it's unnecessarily cruel. Have only 6 sure, 10 of 11 no, and they shouldn't be surprised it's had consequences.", "NTA\n \nits completely normal to want your kids not to be left alone or rejected\n\nAnd you didnt porpusefully send the screenshot just to make a drama..it was just responding to a question someone asked you thats it (but sending the screenshot of a private conversation to someone else is a mistake so watch out next time)\n\nAnd also you didnt make those 4 girls parents to decide to not make their daughters attend \nSo you did nothing wrong\n\nAnd you also taught your daughter than she will not be invited sometimes and that's something that happens and its fine and that is great parenting", "NTA. You didn't intentionally set out to make the other moms back out, you simply shared why it limited to 10 children with ONE other mom. If she felt the hosts choices didn't align with her she has every right to keep her child home. I would have done the same. I wouldn't want my child to be apart of something that was excluding someone else. Not a lesson I want to teach my child. I also find it hard to believe that they couldn't  ask if it would be possible to pay an extra fee to include one other child. If it was 15 kids instead of 10 I could see it being a hard and fast no but 11 instead of 10 shouldn't rock the boat much imo. \n\nIdk why everyone is hating on you sharing a screenshot, typing out \"she hired a service that could only accommodate 10 kids\" is the exact same as sending what she herself said as long as the shot didn't include any other information.", "NTA. \n\nI was ready with my finger on the 'Y', but everything you did was perfectly reasonable.  You asked a reasonable question when you found out your daughter was excluded.  You didn't argue; you accepted the answer even though it was plainly wrong.  Obviously others saw that this is a hair's breadth away from bullying - and it wasn't even the kid doing it!", "NTA. You literally did nothing wrong. Your daughter heard about the party from Sarah. She told Sarah she was not invited. Sarah told her mum. Sarah\u2019s mum suggested you text Addy\u2019s mum. I think asking was reasonable because it was extremely possible that Addy just hadn\u2019t recalled to give the invite not in book club. \n\nWhen Sarah\u2019s mum asked for an update what were you supposed to say? Any lie I can think of just makes it sound worse. You just told her what you were informed - you even sent the exact screenshot of a text. You didn\u2019t paraphrase or make it sound worse. You literally provided it verbatim. If other people want to drop out that is their prerogative. You didn\u2019t even tell them what was happening!\n\nEdit: okay wait after reading these other responses saying sending the screenshot makes you an AH - I am so confused. In my mind paraphrasing Addy\u2019s mum\u2019s text would be worse. Sending the screenshot just ensures no bias. Sarah\u2019s mum is getting the exact reason.", "Nta, they got to know your daughter would find out as little girls talk which is unfair given they were knowingly excluding you \nIf others decided not to go that's their decision", "NTA.  You didn't stir the pot on this one.  And for reference, excluding one girl out of the whole class is a dick move.", "NTA\n\nAddy\u2019s mom is a garbage person for excluding one girl from the class.  I see no problem with your exposing her behavior.  \n\nSarah, and the other girls who didn\u2019t go to the party (as well as their parents) are stand up people.", "NTA. You didn't act as a helicopter parent, you didn't whine or complain to other parents or promote it from your daughter. Hell, you tried to turn this into a life lesson for your daughter. You acted a lot more calmly and rationally than 90% of people on this sub would have. \n\nSome people might not be pleased about you sending a screenshot of the text, and to some extent I get the thought behind that. But this wasn't some deeply personal communication or even gossip. Unless something isn't being said here, it sounds like all you did was send the screenshot instead of quoting verbatim what was said. It wasn't sent unprompted, and the same result would have happened if you'd typed out an explanation. \n\nIs it slightly an AH move to not invite one person? Maybe, but if that one person isn't as involved in the group and it wasn't done on purpose, just necessity due to circumstance, that kind of thing just happens sometimes in life. Just do your best not to get caught in the drama that will likely unfold from here and make sure you're listening to and looking out for your daughter, as the friend group and its dynamic is ultimately going to affect her more than it affects you!", "NTA when only one kid is left out I\u2019d be pretty interested in knowing why myself: was it an accident? We\u2019re there any disputes between the kids i as a parent didn\u2019t know about? Had I or my so done something to piss the other parents of and that was why? \n\nYou\u2019d need to know to fix any problems. And if the other person sees no problem excluding you kid they should also have no problem telling you so or why. \n\nAnd the other parents pulled out because they could see that it was a d move on the birthday throwers part. Plus if they could do it once who\u2019s to say it wouldn\u2019t be their kid randomly excluded next time the nr didn\u2019t agree? \n\nAs for the screenshots, honestly it was the best way of making sure there was no misunderstanding and no \u2018he said she said\u2019 later on.", "NTA", "ESH.  Not inviting one girl in a class and expecting no one to find out is really, really dumb.  They reason I didn\u2019t go NTA is twofold.  1 - they are 9, and at that age friendships become more complex.  Your daughter will need to learn that she will not always be included, and conversely, that it\u2019s ok to not include everyone in things she does.  With better communication this shouldn\u2019t be an issue.  2 - sending someone the screenshot of the conversation with the birthday girls mom is a AH move that is also pretty much guaranteed to start drama.", "NTA they excluded 1 girl from the class. That\u2019s messed up. You also didn\u2019t tell anyone to not go, you simply told the truth when asked. Addy\u2019s mom screwed up big time. Adding one more kid can\u2019t possibly have been that difficult.", "Nta *but* Sarah's mom is a shitstirrer.", "While it is unfortunate that they couldn't host everyone, it happens. Many birthday activities have a limit of 10 people so the birthday child picks their 9 closest friends and sometimes people can't be invited. It's tacky to ask why your child wasn't invited, hell maybe the other girl's mom simply doesn't like your child, that's perfectly fair, they're allowed to invite whomever they want to their events.\n\nOn the one hand, you only spoke with one other mom so it's not your fault others declined due to one child being left out. On the other handem, you should ahve simply explained to your child that sometimes there isn't room to invite everyone. \n\nMy 8 year old has a large group of friends, naturally she's closer to some of the group than others. Sometimes she's invited to the parties and sometimes she isn't since the limit meant not being able to include everyone. It's the same for her parties, some years the venue has no limit or the limit is high enough to include everyone, other times it's not.", "> we all get along well\n\n> we had to stop when the school year began\n\n\nWhy are you keep saying we? Are you also in her class? \n\n\nNTA. They have the right not to invite you, and you have the right to tell other information. Others have the right not to attend.", "You texted a screenshot of a private conversation to someone else. Was it really necessary to do that? \n\nYour daughter isn't in the book club because of another activity. That's fine, but you really can't expect her to be involved in things that are occurring with a group that meets regularly and your daughter isn't involved in.  \n\nYTA", "> She felt it was wrong to not include just one child and she could see if our kids didn\u2019t get along or had drama but that wasn\u2019t the case.\n> Now I\u2019m unsure if I was just a jerk who now cause unnecessary drama in a small group \n\nI don\u2019t think you had any bad intentions, but you also sent a screen shot.

She didn\u2019t expect us to find out.  I responded that I understood but felt it was wrong to not include just one.\n\nYTA & so is Sarah's mom for so many reason in my opinion. Mainly neither you nor Sarah's mom were planning or paying for this event. The mom explained she booked an activity for her daughter's party that had a limit on the number people who could attend. So your response of how it was wrong was completely out of line. Is this woman not supposed to plan activities for her daughter if your's cannot attend? You have no idea what her budget was either. Maybe she could only afford the spa package for 10 people. It was not your place to comment on who is invited to HER daughter's party. Then you shared  private text message wtih Sarah's mom that caused drama. What you did was unnecessary and in bad taste.", "YTA\n\nIf you have your daughter only occasionally showing up for a group activity that meets regularly, you can't expect anyone to take her seriously as a member of the group.  This group meets twice a month, she's showing up maybe 1/4 to 1/2 the time.  \n\nThat's pretty obnoxious.  She's not showing up enough to be involved with the ongoing discussion of books, and trying to catch her up on the discussion is going to disrupt it for everyone.\n\nYou, and your daughter, are treating this book club and friends group as a distant second place to her competitive dance.  That's your choice.  But you can't treat this group and her friends as second-place to competitive dance and still expect them to consider her a full member of their group. \n\nIs competitive dance something your daughter enjoys enough to be putting it ahead of time with her school friends and participating in their social activities?  \n\nIf the dance is leaving her socially isolated and making her an outsider in her own school, she could easily come to resent it rather than enjoy it.  \n\nYou need to have ongoing conversation with your daughter about how the competitive dance affects her larger life, and if it is worth the trade-offs ***to her***.  She's a kid, no competitive activity is more important than letting her be a kid, with friends and school.  Find a balance that lets her enjoy her school social life as well as the dance.", "ESH except Addy's mom and the kids. So I guess just you and Sarah's mom. You made a choice to remove your kid from the book club. Every choice has consequences. Because she's less involved in the groups lives she's understandably being included less.\n\nYou ruined a child's birthday because of this.

Meaning, you should be saying \u201cdon\u2019t not go because of me.\u201d Passing out invitations is awkward and stressful as a kid. As a personal aside- one time a girl passed out birthday party invitations at school and my best friend asked me if I had gotten mine because she had literally seen it. Never got it. Never heard about the party after. Wondered about it because no, I don\u2019t think my friend was insensitive or lying (it was likely bc of class change and us not being friends but just classmates so it wasnt important to redistribute who she missed) but it wasn\u2019t the end of the world. I have never held beef nor asked but I still wonder sometimes and laugh, like right now.

Addy\u2019s mom is TAH for excluding one and then telling you she purposely did it because she didn\u2019t think you or your daughter would know? Is she stupid? Kids talk. Social media is a thing. I would be so mad and do what Sarah\u2019s mom did. I\u2019d pull my kid out. \n\nYou were perfectly okay to ask if the invitation was missed. Kids lose things or assume the parents know.

This wasn\u2019t like there were 20 girls and only half got invited, this is a close group of 11 girls, and only 10 were invited. If this was no big deal, 4 other parents wouldn\u2019t tell their own children you aren\u2019t going because this is wrong. So yes- you are supposed to say no because people\u2019s hearts are more important. Imagine what her daughter is going to feel like the next time all those girls are together and excitedly talking about the party- the one that she didn\u2019t go to because she was the only one in the whole group who wasn\u2019t invited. Additionally, as the parent booking the party, I would have told the staff- I want to book a party but we have 11 girls and are willing to pay for the extra but we can only do 11. If they couldn\u2019t accommodate then I would have taken my daughter to the spa by herself as a mom & daughter day thing and figured out something else for the party or found another spa that could accommodate. Im sure the package probably included 10 and they could add one one. Imagine a bridal party with 11 people- are you just going to leave 1 bridesmaid home because 10 is the limit?! I guarantee these places are flexible bc they have groups coming and going all the time. This was Addy\u2019s mom hurting a child bc the package was for 10 and it was easier to leave a child out than ask and pay for an add on. And as a mom, I can tell you that there is no way in hell that that child \u201cwasn\u2019t going to find out about\u201d and hear all the details of that party. Imagine if that was your child and they now have to wonder why they were the 1 kid in the group of friends that was left out- on purpose too. How do you think that 9 year old feels about herself?", "NTA. I have a rule with my kids. They can either invite the whole class, all the girls, all the boys, or no more than 25% of the class if they want to pick and choose. That way they will never be having a party where a majority of the kids were invited but just a few were left out.", "Nta. You didn't have anything to do with other people deciding that they won't be apart of excluding a child. The fact that mom said \"I didn't think you'd find out\" is the calling card of every butt hole", "NTA. That mom was a major AH for inviting 9 out of 10 of her daughter\u2019s classmates, and excluding just one. \n\nOur rule for our kids is that if they want to invite more than 50% of their same-gender classmates, they have to invite them all. Each of them has about 15 kids of their gender in their grade. My younger prefers smaller parties and usually invites 5-6 kids. My older likes big parties so has opted to invite all 15 + a few friends from other schools, so ~20 total. Leaving out just one kid and inviting everyone else is thoughtless.", "NTA. The mom should have known your daughter would find out she\u2018s the only one not invited. It\u2018s kinda cruel to do such a thing.", "NTA My kids attended a small school (about 16 or fewer per grade) and at this age, excluding just one is hurtful. I\u2019m sure that the spa people would have added one more, had they been asked.", "Nta. She\u2019s upset with the consequences of her own actions", "NTA\n I'm petty. I would invite everyone to a mimosa party and exclude Addy's mom. Hire a masseuse and post pics. Tell her there was a limit to how many could come and she just didn't pass the muster. Get the rest in on it too.", "Sarah already knew you weren\u2019t invited, when your kid didn\u2019t go, she\u2019d have asked (or even before).  \n\nI am generally against inviting yourself but this was particularly weird if they\u2019re all still close.  In what world wouldn\u2019t daughter find out?   Utterly ridiculous to think otherwise.  \n\nEither that mom is TA or she\u2019s covering that her daughter no longer likes yours, which only drags our more drama", "NTA\n\nBut Spa for 10 year olds? Is that normal now?", "Well, I think you acted trying to do what is best for your daughter. If my daughter was the only one not invited for a birthday class in a party I would ask the mother of the birthday girl as well, it can very well be bullying or something else like they were having a fight, in both cases as parent you should be aware of what happened. Probably Sarah doesn't see your daughter as a book club member anymore and it is ok, but they are still on the same class and see each other every day.\n\nOn the other hand I am not sure about sending prints of personal conversations with someone else, but Sarah's mother chose to alienate your daughter, so she has to deal with the consequences of her acts.", "NTA. She was being cruel. Her actions were found out, there were consequences.", "NTA you had every reason to think it was an oversight and you didn\u2019t push or create upset you told one person who asked you.", "NTA. It was not your intention, you thought it was a mistake. It was their intention to leave your daughter out, against the group spirit. Sarah's mom felt strongly about this, which was right and few other moms supported her, and you. I would say this is rather a life lesson for the birthday girl & her mom. \n\nI am quite sure what ever the treatment was, they could have stretched it to 11 from 10, children wouldn't know what to expect so they could have arranged one more in. I can't imagine any business would refuse if you tell them one child would not be invited to the whole party because of them if they are not able to squeeze in one more.", "NTA, it hurts to find out about a social event to which you're not invited in this way even as an adult. You asked the question on your daughter's behalf and left it at that. You didn't tell four children not to attend", "NTA, you clearly didn\u2019t set out to ruin a kid\u2019s party. Addy\u2019s mom on the other hand is a big a-hole.", "NTA because as a mom of an 8 year old girl, I probably would have done the same as you. \n\nBut I\u2019m confused as to why the party-throwing mom didn\u2019t ask for the spa person to let her add on just one more kid\u2026 and if they said no I\u2019d come up with a new party plan that included ALL of the girls so nobody would feel left out. Also, there are 10 girls that are going to be at the party and one who wasn\u2019t invited- and the party throwing mom thought the one wouldn\u2019t find out? Has she MET children!? They talk a LOT. It was a given the uninvited one would find out.", "NTA and good on Sarah\u2019s Mum for the solidarity to your daughter. That was very mean not to invite one kid and I would\u2019ve asked in those circumstances, assuming it would\u2019ve been an error.", "Here's my question: Why did this person book something that had a limit of 10 people knowing there were 11 children in here daughter's class?", "Nta. It\u2019s a small class, of course your daughter is going to find out and of course you\u2019re going to ask about it. You didn\u2019t approach in a negative way whatsoever, only wanted to why and you got response. Whatever happened afterwards doesn\u2019t have to do with you. Clearly she\u2019s bothered because she expected a different outcome where people were more understanding towards why she only left one child out. She sucks.", "NTA, I do feel bad for the birthday girl though", "NTA.\n\nIn a class of 11, it is shitty to exclude one person and\n\n1. Not even bother to tell them\n2. Pull the \"you weren't supposed to find out\"\n\nIt's normal and reasonable that in a close or tight knight group, everyone is invited. It is pretty shitty to plan an event and exclude one person specifically. Given that other parents had pulled out and \"you weren't supposed to find out\", it is likely that they had been told that all of the girls were going only to find out that just one had been left out.\n\nAddy's mom had brought it upon herself. It's one thing to not be invited, it's another to \"not supposed to find out\" because that shows they were intending to not even have the courtesy of telling you.", "NTA. As there was nothing negative going on between the girls, it was reasonable to assume that the other parents had dropped the ball and forgotton that one girl wasn't at the book club. What wasn't reasonable was for the brithday girl's mother to assume that, in such a small group, your daughter wouldn't discover that she had been left out. What was her thought process, I wonder. \"Oh, we can only have ten places? Well, X doesn't come to book club all the time so that's easy, we'll just not invite her, we can give the invites out when she's not here, and pretend nothing is happening because, of course, none of the girls or their parents ever talk to each other.\" \n\nI might not have shown anyone else the exchange, just said \"they could only have ten so decided to limit it to the full-time book club.\" I can sort of see the corner that Addy's mum jammed herself into, though I have to wonder whether she spoke to the spa person and explained the situation. Sometimes, being nice, polite and offering to pay an extra amount to cover one more attendee in a case like this can be very helpful.", "NTA. You didn't push anything, and Addy's mum was out of line for knowingly (by her own admission) inviting all the kids bar one.\n\nI totally get that sometimes there is a numbers thing with parties, but I have never let my kids just leave out one or two people. It's everyone OR there's a reasonable enough amount NOT invited that no one can feel singled out.", "I don\u2019t really think anyone is the AH here.\n\nI think texting and not speaking on the phone/in person left too much room for interpretation/second guessing.  \n\nI think it was an oversight but not malicious and if everyone had connected live maybe OP\u2019s daughter could have joined post spa and/or the other mom could have just asked about the cost of one more.  \n\nThere were solutions available but communicating electronically on our phones, at least with those we don\u2019t know intrinsically, can get needlessly messy.", "ESH Holy shit you guys. Get a job or a hobby or something. This is some insane Real Housewives meets The Prince crap. \n\nThis is all nonsense and means absolutely nothing. Go build a house with Habitat or\u2026 watch Jack Reacher on Amazon Prime. There are millions of better ways to spend your time and, more importantly, your emotional energy.", "Honestly by drawing attention to this and sharing conversations will more likely than not hurt your child more than good, you should have left it slone and yes i think YTA for causing drama.", "Yeah, my mom tried to get me into birthdays, too. She gave up when she realized that the other girls just didn't like me. Tough situation, but this is just life sometimes.", "NTA. You behaved in good faith, checked in if there was a mistake, accepted when there wasn't and told the truth without any embellishment to another mother. \n\nYou are not responsible for the behaviour of other mothers who have decided not to attend. You are also not responsible for the behaviour of the OG mum who decided to invite 10/11 children to a party. \n\nIt's absurd to me that she thought your child wouldn't find out about a party every other girl in her class went to.

Your daughter wasn't invited (for whatever reason) and you should never have pushed to get her invited.  You don't know what the repercussions might be at school for your daughter.  My mother did this to me when I was a child and it had terrible repercussions.  The birthday girl was my school bully and I did not want to go to the party.  But my sister was invited, so my mother called the birthday girl's mother and wangled an invitation for me too.  The bully made it very clear to everyone at the party that I was there under sufferance and I suffered for it at school.

Not the first time I hear this. Anyways she should have handled it differently, of course you two would've found out sooner than later, at least she should have invited her to the movie. Idk. if she never intended to invite you kid on the first place, that obviously creates drama on such a tight group, and of course the other mom is the A.

It's only 11 girls, all except your daughter got an invite, and she wasn't present when they were distributed. It was okay for you to call if there was an oversight. You can't control the other mothers' reactions. They chose to not attend as a mark of solidarity, and send a social message to the other mother, who did the wrong thing by booking a service that would exclude one girl (a shit move, btw). It's a learning experience for all.", "NTA\n\nThat was really crappy of Addy's mom, and you didn't ruin anything. You asked her, she answered, and if anyone else dropped out of the party,  it's because of her behaviour, not yours.", "NTA. Honestly, I don't blame you for approaching Addy's mother. I can only imagine how horrible it would've felt for your daughter for everyone in the class discussing the party the next day at school, and your daughter having no idea what they were talking about.\n\nJust be careful, Addy might be a bit upset at your daughter for 'ruining' her party. She might  not understand the whole situation due to her age.", "NTA.  \n\n\nBut I would recommend a course of fixing the damage - take into account, this comes from someone who is not a parent, but I do work in a teaching position with kids around the same age and been on the sidelines for a few instances of drama between parents over the years.  \n\n\nAnd if its not put to rest and the fire of the drama stopped, it can potentially keep coming up and making the relationship between you parents, and as a result, your kids, strained.  \n\n\nI'd recommend doing something along the line of making a group message to everybody in the parent group with a text along the following.  \n\n\n\"Hey everybody.  \n\n\nIt has come to my attention that my daughters lack of invitation to Addy's birthday party has lead to some conflict and a few of you in sympathy having cancelled your daugthers participation in the party. While I appreciate and is touched by the sympathy, I would love this not to become a point of conflict and drama.  \n\n\nAddy's parents, as I understand it, acted on a wish from Addy to have a spa event at her birthday party, and the service they was able to find for it had a hard limit of 10 attending. While sad not to have my daugher invited, they made a judgement call to invite the 9 others in the book club to the event, in order to give Addy the birthday party she wanted. They did not do it to be mean to me or my daughter, just to as parents make the wish of their daughter come true on her birthday.   \n\n\nWhile you may or may not agree if that was the right call on their behalf, lets not pretend any of us are perfect and make the right decision all the time; For instance it was maybe not the right call of me to share the conversation I had with Addy's mom about it, leading it to get further shared and putting many of you in a position of feeling you had to take sides, I apologize for putting you in that position and to Addy's parents for impacting what should been just a happy day for their daughter to celebrate her birthday\"  \n\n\nThat got a bit longwinded, dont know if you could summarize it more, and maybe call/text Addy's parents first about it and make sure they fine with it too; Would be a shame if their tight knit group dissolves from a single instance of a bad judgement", "NTA\n\n>Edit: my daughter does still attend book club once per month to once every other month. She didn\u2019t totally leave. She\u2019s just not a full time member.\n\n>Sarah\u2019s mom said Addy had handed them out at the last book club and had probably just forgot to reach out.\n\nThis seems plausible. If she didn't attend the book club anymore, I wouldn't ask about the invitation. But she is part of the book club, so it seemed like a mistake.\n\nSarah's mom made the decision to share this with other moms. And they decided not to let their children go. This is not your fault.", "I may get downvoted a lot for this but NTA and props to Sarah's mom for standing up to it. Her point is right they did hire someone knowing only one girl would be left out. I don't think it was wrong of you to contact her I don't see anything wrong in asking her why your daughter was excluded.", "You are in absolutely NO WAY the AH!!! Don't apologize!! You looked out for your kid, had she not known about it beforehand ( like the mom intended, didn't think you'd find out cause little girls are going to talk) she would have definitely caught wind about I it later, making her feel bad she was the ONLY one not invited ... Addy's mom sucks and was probably a mean girl, props to Sarah's mom for telling the group!  Nothing in this situation is your fault and you are definitely not the AH! Kudos to the other parents that pulled their kids out of this mean girl shit... I wouldn't my kid to participate in a party that only one girl was excluded from, it's a teaching moment as a parent to always consider the people around you and don't be exclusive. Addy's mom ruined the party by not inviting your daughter! You're a good mom, NTA", "I- This gets worse by the second. So Addy's mom intended to pull off the other girls to a spa without ever informing the other parents of this until after the fact? At this point I don't think your kid being excluded is the only reason the other moms pulled theirs. This feels off so badly in so many ways.", "No, you did nothing wrong. NTA", "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. As another commenter said, sending the screenshot was the best thing you could do to explain the situation to the other mom, because you showed her exactly how it played out. There\u2019s no room for concern that you might have misrepresented what happened. \n\nThe fact that several other girls\u2019 moms have pulled them from the party is proof that you\u2019re NTA and the bday girl\u2019s mom is TA. Excluding just one girl from a tight-knit group is plain mean. Bday girl\u2019s mom is mad because she knows she did something wrong, she just didn\u2019t expect to get caught. But it was delusional of her to think that she could exclude one girl from this party and no one would find out.", "\u2018It\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s just that I can only have 20 people max, there are 21 in the grade, and you are the one I like the least so you miss out - but it\u2019s not *personal*, it\u2019s numbers!\u2019\n\nI understand numbers when you can only have 10 and there are 25 kids to choose from, no one is going to be close to everyone, but finding out you are dead last in the friend order? That shit stings forever.", "Screenshot is even better than telling your own version of what happened. Let people make up their own mind with the evidence provided.", "1) Thie isn't an event with adult, but little girls.\n\n2) OP's daughter is the only one in the group left our and without a good reason.", "I agree with the two first, don't go, don't ask, but I would totally go to the late invite. It's not a problem for me if I was not first choice. Noone can be everyone's first choice. I do have close friends, and friends who are less close. I have fun with all of them.", "> Wouldn\u2019t a class this small have a mandatory invite-all rule? \n\nSounds very Orwellian, telling kids they have to invite who Big Brother wants and not who they want.", "The biggest thing to remember is that Addys mom had the opportunity to reach out to you and explain why she was hosting a party that had a limited number of invites, she made the choice not to do that and she has to know that for a young child, competitive dancer or not your daughter is still a child, it is very traumatic to be the only one left out of an event that your entire peer group is invited to. \n\nThere is no reason when she first put this together that she could not have reached out to you. \n\nIt is unfortunate that Addy is being punished for her Mom\u2019s behavior, and I can understand how sick to your stomach you feel right now about what Addy is going through. \n\nIf you like you can always invite Addy to a play date with your daughter where they go to the movies or do something else to celebrate Addy\u2019s birthday so that she understands that nothing that is happening has anything to do with her. \n\nYou can even arrange for a delivery of something fun like flowers to come to her house on her birthday so the little girl on the other side of this (Addy) isn\u2019t left feeling bad either. And this way you can make Addy feel happy, without having to deal with Addy\u2019s mom. \n\nWhat you can\u2019t do is make Addys mom be a more compassionate person, and that is OK", "Where did you get that the girls aren\u2019t close?", "And? Everyone at school sees everyone else, do you think that means they're obligated to be friends with everyone and be forced to do stuff with them outs of school?", "They go to school together and the OP said the girls are all close in this small grade. I can\u2019t imagine this once a week book club is some difference maker.", "But when it\u2019s 10 out of 11 kids being included, that\u2019s exclusion in my opinion.", "It means you are not among their very closest friends, but that they like you. Unless it's someone you thought was your BFF, or if like here a whole friend group  EXCEPT one was originally invited, I don't see the problem with that.", "But that\u2019s not what this is. You\u2019re an adult. Inviting every 9-year old girl in a class EXCEPT for one is very mean. And to expect that the other girls wouldn\u2019t talk about it is delusional.", "Not asking because you weren't told is far from respecting yourself.", "More like pride or insecurity you don\u2019t need a code each situation has nuance", "For an adult I\u2019d be inclined to agree but not for kids this age. They\u2019d have all gone to the party and talked about it in class afterwards. It\u2019s messed up. Parent should have done something that everyone could be included in", "I mean, I wasn\u2019t invited to a thing just cause the host didn\u2019t realise I was back in the country - so sometimes it pays to get a mutual to ask :)", "Did you miss the part about it being a small school \"with only 11 girls in her grade\"? So yeah, it was all the girls in her class except for one.", "Just out of curiosity, if she\u2019d typed the convo out verbatim with \u2018I said this\u2019 and \u2018then she said this\u2019 in the middle of it would it be more acceptable in your eyes?", "I think the bottom line is the adults behaved in a way that made everything worse and that'll probably cause negativity between the girls. \n\nSomeone upthread referred to the moms as behaving like the Real Housewives and frankly, I think that's spot on.", "OP's kid wasn't shunned, she is facing the natural consequences of being a competitive dancer (really a competitive anything) as a child. OP isn't a  asshole, though I don't think she should have asked, but the life lesson isn't \"we can't expect to be invited every time\", it's \"competitive dancing means your social life and relationships will suffer\". I don't see why it's toxic to not invite a kid who only shows up for a shared activity once every other month; it was OP and her daughter who distanced themselves to prioritize another activity.", "Lovey you don't have 100 close friends you have 100 acquaintances with whom you engage in transactional favours on a quid pro quo basis. That doesn't qualify as afriendship let alone close one.\n\nI'm assuming you're young & still in the stage of life where quantity beats quality. That won't last. Maybe start being more selective in your choices or you'll run the risk of ending up with no real friends. Ask anyone in that position & they'll tell you it's not a fun place to be.", "No, no they didn't cancel.   \n\n\nInvites often go out piece meal for lots of reasons. \n\n People decide to invite the 5 ppl that they know the contact info for and  get the rest of the addresses later.  Kids have a list that is totally complete and then show up sobbing the next day because they totally forgot their 3rd best friend. Some ppl get contacted by email. Some by text. Some by note. Someone got divorced and they don't have the kids that week and take a while to get back. Kid doesn't tell you that Clara and Claira are actually two different kids.   \n\n\nTaking a slightly late invite as a personal slight is a rigid and self-defeating approach.", "Eh, sometimes staggering invites can happen, like with events where you are inviting a lot of friends from different parts of your life and the planning is a bit adhoc.\n\nAlso, sometimes people wait to invite you for a reason. Why bother texting you today for plans next week, if Im seeing you tommorow and can invite you in person then?\n\nPlus, sometimes plans change. Maybe your friends were going to do something you are known not to like and that you never show up to (say, clubbing or hiking). The plan falls through due to unforseen circumstances (rainining makes the hike impossible, the club is closed for a private event) and they end up doing something else, which you actually like.

But when you see each other every day that's different", "It\u2019s way more common than you\u2019d think.", "There are genuine invitations and invitations out of politeness, that have to be honored nevertheless. At my wedding, there was one cousin I wanted to attend. For keeping peace in the family, I however invited all of them. If one of them would\u2018ve said, he/she wouldn\u2019t come, I would\u2019ve invited someone else.", "Yeah that isn't self respect, that's main character shit.", "The words out of my mouth. It\u2019s okay to not be close to everyone, I\u2019d still take a late invite.

And most dance parents I know would be laughing at being accused of bending our kids to our will! It's usually the other way around, and we are being dragged along for the ride! Not saying it never happens, but in 12+ years at a studio, I would say I know 1 or maybe 2 parents like you are describing, and literally hundreds who are pretty normal and have normal kids who just love dance.", "Also for events like weddings, sometimes you're sending out invites a year before the wedding. Relationships change in that time.\n\nThere's a couple that were originally just evening guests of my wedding and we became such good friends with them in the following few months that we were actually super excited when someone else cancelled and we got to invite them to the whole day.", "I feel like weddings are different though, there's so much family obligation and political shite around them. I got a late invite to a friend's wedding which she told me straight up was due to family politics, and I didn't mind at all. Not sure if that'd translate well to a party, but I suppose everyone is different!", "My wife and I did the exact same. We had a max capacity of 50 guests, and invited our very dearest friends and family to attend. When some guests canceled 2 months in advance, we sent out a select number of invites to family friends who we didn\u2019t originally have space for. They said yes, and it was such a joy to have as many loved ones as possible attend our wedding. One couple in particular were my sister\u2019s best friend\u2019s parents, whom I\u2019ve known for 25 years. I\u2019m so incredibly thankful that they could be there, even if it was only possible because other dear friends couldn\u2019t be.", "I'm suspicious about the claim that the person doing the spa day for a nine-year-olds birthday party has a strict limit of ten.  I'm surprised no one else has questioned this.\n\nAlong with that, I find it odd that out of ten girls invited to the party, four of them have been pulled out, presumably by the mothers after OP shared the screen shot of the birthday girl's mother's explanation for excluding OP's daughter.  It sounds like there is some undercurrents of tension between the mothers of this little group of classmates.\n\nAm I being overly suspicious and reading too much into things?", "Yes. Refusing to participate, and missing out, because you weren't top of the list is pride lol", "Yeah I absolutely agree with this. It's not always an afterthought. Years back a friend of mine, was getting married with limited numbers so I was only invited to the reception. A-OK with me. Couple of people dropped out in the days before and he invited me to the wedding since a space had opened up.  \n\nWasn't for a second offended about not being invited originally, quite the opposite.
