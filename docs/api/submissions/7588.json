It sounds a mis-communication at most between you and your Dad.  Especially as it was already considered by you and your mum that you'd be hanging out with your sisters.  I can understand your Dad's disappintment as he was looking forward to hanging out but he's not being harsh to you about it.", "NAH - this was a miscommunication. Your father did wanted to spend time with you. He\u2019s just bummed be didnt get to. \n\nI would try and find a joint activity you can both do together.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like dad loves and wants to spend time with you, but is going about it the wrong way by suggesting the wrong activities. You should totally be able to spend time with mom and sis if they\u2019re doing activities you prefer. \n\nIf you also want to spend time with dad, can you suggest something you\u2019d have fun doing to him? He should make the effort to bond over your interests too. But it doesn\u2019t sound like he suffers from \u201cbad dad\u201d syndrome, so I hope he\u2019d be open to something, even if it\u2019s just a movie and lunch!", "NAH \u2014 it's totally fair (and nice) that your dad wants to spend time with you, but at the same time, choosing an activity that you don't like is not conducive to making that happen. It might be nice for you to sit down with your dad and figure out an activity you can all enjoy.", "Nah. But it\u2019s nice that your dad wants to bond with you, so perhaps you guys can find something to bond over, but something you BOTH enjoy.", "I\u2019m telling you this as a 24 year old man with two older brothers: it\u2019s not about the fishing trip. Your dad and your brothers wanted a guys night. They wanted an opportunity to bond, father and sons and brothers. The thing you need to consider is not \u201cwill I enjoy the activity,\u201d but rather \u201cwhat will we look back on?\u201d\n\nYour older brother is 20. Let\u2019s face facts, your dad is in his mid-40s? He\u2019s halfway through the average lifespan. He knows cars, he knows sports, and he knows fishing. So he wants to make memories with his boys, you among them. Fishing is probably the easiest one to access because you can learn how to fish in an afternoon. You can\u2019t learn and memorize all the names of players on a team or all the rules of a game, or all the fine tuning an engine requires in a day, but fishing is easy to pick-up, and the easiest way to bond for him.\n\nAsk yourself what you will have to look back on, 30 years from now. What fond memories will you have of your father and brothers, because they will not always be there. Ask yourself what memories your father and brothers will have of you if the worst should come to pass. \n\nIt\u2019s never about the sports, the cars, the fishing, the makeup, the fashion, the action movies or the rom-coms.\n\nUltimately, NAH. It\u2019s just down to what you choose to prioritize, and of course right now you think that you\u2019ll have plenty of time with your brothers and your dad, and I sincerely hope that you do. But remember to take the opportunities presented to you, even if they\u2019re not perfect. My brothers don\u2019t talk anymore. I live with my parents, but I still barely see them because we all work, and I\u2019m trying to move out in a month, which will just put more distance between us.\n\nLive in the moment. Take what you can get. Treasure the time you have.", "NTA\n\nIf the communication was much clear then the situation wouldn't arose. If your father wants to plan something with you then you both can later make plans involving a common interest. You should choose whatever your heart desires and whatever is suitable to you.", "NAH- can't fault Dad for still trying to bond with you but he needs to get a clue on finding a common interest.\n\nSo, is there anything like say bowling or poker or an escape room something you can do with your Dad/bros that you also dont mind doing? Then reach out to your Dad saying, hey can we redo boys night and try X..", "Don't understand the N-A-Hs. It was absolutely assholeish of dad to expect OP to come without inviting him and hearing a yes. Then he sulked about something that was obviously his fault and ruined the trip for the brothers. NTA, dad was unreasonable. If he wants to bond with you, he needs to make more of an effort to connect with your interests and hobbies.", "NAH, but it would probably be nice to try to have a some bonding activities with the male side of the family. Your dad may have some antiquated ideas about gender but it sounds like he genuinely wanted to bond with you and might not be so good at expressing that. It sounds like he's trying.", "It seems like you share more interests and time with your mom and sister, so it\u2018s quite understandable your dad is disappointed that you two didn\u2018t get to have some more bonding time. I get you\u2018re not super interested in what he had planned but these kind of outings are not just about shared interests but spending time together. Like others suggested, talk to your dad and you can come up together with ideas for something to do together and spend some time. \n\nNAH", "NAH\n\nThough as someone who lost her dad...I'd say: make effort to bond with your dad. It seems his heart is in the right place.\n\nThis isn't malice, this probably wasn't even about the fishing - this was about spending time with you!\n\nHis interests might be the only thing he knows how to bond over.\n\nI suggest asking your dad to do an activity you both might enjoy? Surely there must be something?", "NYA. Well, you are 18, and the bonding ship has more or less sailed, one would think. Your Dad should know where your interests lie. One suggestion: You might be able to bond with him over some domestic handyman type activity, like repairs or something that you will logically need to know how to do at some point, after you have your own place. Unless he is inept at these things, it might be a practical solution. Car repairs also, and you should seriously think about getting your sister involved with those, for the same reasons!. It doesn't sound like there's any hostility, so that's something to be grateful for. Keep working on it... There is likely to be a middle ground if everyone can be open-minded.", "NTA you're not responsible for how your dad reacts to you hanging out with your mother and sister!", "Had they considered that the trip probably wouldn't have been much better when one of four of them was miserable (and they knew ahead of time that you wouldn't like doing it)? Totally unfair of your brothers and father to expect the same person to accommodate/compromise/take one for that team every time. Your brothers, too, are plenty old enough to not be jealous over activities or something, which seems like your dad's projection on them maybe. Teens and 20? They won't give a shit if they miss an outing here and there, especially as it seems activities are a regular thing and ones they enjoy, no?\n\nDefinitely a family dynamics issue without maliciousness or anything like that. NAH. Imo, closest ones to being A H are your brothers for being pissy with you the next day, but the only reason it seems is because they don't like seeing your dad upset, so I can understand a bit. Overall though, they made an assumption you'd be there, and for an activity they know you don't like, so.\n\nI also totally get going through Mom when you've actively and willingly tried - as a child in the relationship! - so many times before to get the point across or find middle ground with little success. It can feel very exasperating, and seeking a helping hand is natural.", "This can happen when parents have different interests from their children.\n\nMost men bond through sideways activity, that's by doing something together (women tend to bond face to face, which means by talking).   \nThat's a little bit of a stereotype as obviously both are capable of both, and individuals may differ with preference, but the concept is good to understand in order to figure out how to interact with other people.\n\nYour dad's a little older so he's probably not great at bonding in ways other than the traditional ones prescribed to men.    \nWhich isn't all that unusual. A lot of people struggle with it.   \nBut it's not really about the fishing, like /u/ben-tobox-san said, it's about bonding. It's just that fishing is something he knows how to do, something he likely shared with his father, and so it's something he'd like to share with you.\n\nPersonally, I hate carpentry work, but my dad likes it and is good at it so I've done a lot of it over the years because it's a shared activity that lets us bond. He gets to teach me something he enjoys, which makes him happy.   \nAlso it's a useful skill that comes in handy occasionally.   \n\nMy mom meanwhile insists on going to church on Christmas. She's not really religious, it's just something she used to do with her dad and so it's important to her.   \nI don't like it, I don't particularly want to go. But it's important to mom so I go, and I hold her hand, and I sing the psalms, and then we go to the burial grounds to put lights on the gravestones, and mom is happy.\n\nFor people who are nature inclined sharing nature moments is of particular value.   \nLike catching fish. Think of it as being a noteworthy life occasion that your father can witness you achieve. A personal milestone that has value for your father.   \nIt's something *he* understands, and values, which is why he wants to share it with you and with your brothers.   \nHe probably sees that you and your brothers aren't all that close and he knows he's running out of time to do so because at your age it's really not that long until you'll end up spreading with the wind in every direction and only meet for the occasional family gathering. Very soon it's not unlikely that it will be years between every time you see your siblings.\n\nYou're not an asshole, but you will be a lot happier in 30 years if you suck it up every now and then and just try to bond with your father and your brothers in the way they understand.   \nI'm not saying that's fair or that it wouldn't be better if they tried to go with you sometimes, and maybe you can work that in so you can do something you'll enjoy more later.\n\nBut for now, every now and then just go with them and catch a fish, if you don't know how to fish and how to fillet it just have him teach you.   \nIt'll be a big deal for him and you'll learn a useful skill or two. \n\nAnd in a few decades you'll be really happy you did it.", "NTA - I would suggest having a guys night out doing what you like and invite your brothers and Dad.", "You didn\u2019t ruin the trip! You like what you like!! I\u2019m sure he loves you and was just surprised is all. Take him out to lunch or dinner just the two of you and bond. Let him know you didn\u2019t mean to hurt his feelings.  \n\nHe probably should have asked you if you wanted to go rather than assume.. so I\u2019m going to go with \n\nNAH because he cares enough about you that it hurt his feelings you didn\u2019t go. \n\nEnjoy him\u2665\ufe0f", "I wouldn\u2019t call you an AH but it does seem as if your dad genuinely wanted to spend some quality time with you. I would suggest that you talk to your father about the reasons you felt uncomfortable and see if you can do something together that would be fun for the two of you.", "NTA.\n\nYou're 18yo--you aren't suddenly going to enjoy a fishing trip if you haven't up until now.  Your dad has a right to his own feelings, but you aren't responsible for keeping him from being sad that you don't want to bond over HIS interests.\n\nIt really comes down to your dad (and maybe brothers) being \"sad\" or \"disappointed\" that you are who you are, which makes THEM the AH, not you.", ">I had a talk with my mum that i wasnt comfortable with going\n\nPoor dad.

I think depending on what kind of relationship you want for the two of you, you may have to do more of the accommodating, but do what feels appropriate to you (as you did here). There are friendships and close relationships that stay important where you may be the one who goes with the flow because the relationship or closeness is of value to you. You always have to measure where your limit is and stay keyed into that. If it\u2019s not worth it, or you feel unvalued because of the lack of reciprocation, put distance.\n\nThere are people for whom I would do an activity I think is a little tedious to spend time with them, and there are those for whom I wouldn\u2019t.

Now that my dad has passed on, I look at all those ball games and activities with intense fondness. I got to spend time with my dad and now talk to my kids about things I did with my dad. It didn\u2019t matter if they were kinda boring for me.

You're NTA, but your dad kind of is.  Even if it's unintentional, he's not doing the work to bond with each of his kids and meet them where they are.  Yes, it's difficult to bond with people when you have separate interests, but the onus is on him as a parent to take an interest in you and care about the things that interest you.  He doesn't have to be personally invested in fashion to take you shopping.  He doesn't have to enjoy makeup to appreciate effort you put into that area.\n\nAlso, why is it unfair to do archery when your brothers don't like it, but it's okay to go fishing if you don't like it?  Dad is playing favourites (again, doesn't matter if it's intentional).  He needs to step up or accept that his relationship with his son is going to be distant.  Sometimes parents have to set their own stuff aside in order to be there for their kids.  That is a thing you sign on for when you become a parent.\n\nI'm sorry you're in this situation.

He wants to do activities he likes rather than ones we like.", "How about a movie? That's pretty generic if you can find something you both want to watch. Or a museum? Ask him if he'd be willing, seems like he wants to connect but his manly manhood is in the way lol.", "That's not okay. I don't like half the things my son's do but I still do them with them and try to make it a positive experience because it's important to them and me that we have a good relationship. My youngest lives sports and I have never been interested but I love him and want to be a part of his life so I focus on the positive. I'm spending time with my son and he's happy to share his time with me. That's called being a parent.", "Does your sister like archery too by any chance? You could try for an activity for you, Dad, and Sister that you 3 like together, and your brothers cam have their own activity. Frame it up as \"Sis and I are doing XYZ and want you to join us.\" \n\nYour brothers don't need to be included in everything. They get their own time with Dad. From your posts it sounds like they're upset that you don't join them in fishing and they're upset if you try to do anything different. IOW they're unhappy if you don't go along and do stuff you don't like (which is exactly what they're unwilling to do). They need to back off and let you have your own relationship with him.", ">Everytime we have spent time alone together its always \"unfair\" to my brothers so they end up joining us in the long run.\n\nINFO: Who thinks it is unfair? Your Dad or your brothers? Or both?\n\nI may be off base, but is there a concerted  plot to get you interested in more \"manly\" activities? There are some weird gender role vibes with all the men doing manly stuff together while your sister does girly stuff with your mom. Especially considering you are gay.", "Is there nothing you siblings all like, you/your brother like, your bro/sister? Do you know if your brother has similar complaints against your mom? It can be hard to juggle multiple kids and bonding with everyone.", "No mum will do activities with everyone even if shes not personally interested in. Its really hard to find common ground as siblings for activities.", "NTA \n\nRom coms > fishing. Your dad and brothers don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing out on! \n\nIt can be frustrating when anyone, especially your dad, wants to spend time with you only if you tag along on to what they want to do.\n\nIt also sounds like you are singled out for being the only male in your family not into \u201cboy\u201d things.", "I have the exact same problem with my dad! He can bond with my brothers over drinking or football etc but when it comes to me he struggles to even agree on a movie (and I don\u2019t insist on romcoms either). \n\nThe only thing we have managed to bond over is Lego so far, and that took years of him saying it was boring / childish until my brother-in-law \u2018introduced\u2019 him - then suddenly it was fun. \n\nI\u2019d love to do more together but I think my dad\u2019s only hobby is wine tasting and I don\u2019t drink. I\u2019ve tried watching sports with him but I\u2019m not allowed to interrupt so we don\u2019t talk. \n\nOP don\u2019t give up! Try and find something that you both have in common, even if it is just something you both don\u2019t hate. Does your dad play chess? Cooking/baking/bread making? Maybe a family games night?", "NTA and from your comments this is a Dad problem (you might want to update your post with the address info about how he only ever wants to spend time with you if he gets to do what he wants to do.)\n\n\nThe NAH people are focusing on the best case scenario perspective which is fine and good, but as others have pointed out: this isn\u2019t on you, and it *is* on him. \n\n\nIf he actually wants to spend time with you for you, and not because he gets to force you to do what he wants? He will find a way to make that happen.", "But isn't OP also bonding with his mother and sister? If bonding with children was so important why wasn't sister invited? Why wasn't dad hurt that sister wasn't coming?", "This. It's not about the fish you catch but about the conversations you have while trying", "True, I could watch rom coms all day and not get sick of them. Fishing on the other hand is icky and I dont like hurting the poor fishies. It kind of does feel like i get singled out but my mum and sis make up for it. But its not like it was a surprise to my dad that i loved \"girly\" things. I would play with Barbies, my fav colour was pink, I always wanted to dress up as disney princesses (I was obsessed with disney when i was young), talked about wanting to marry aladdin for some reason. So its not like my dad was just blindsided by it all.", "maybe you two can come up with a two-part plan? come up with a day of stuff he likes that he can share with you that you're open to and might enjoy, and then a day of stuff you like that he is open to that you can share with him that he might enjoy?", "How about mini-golf?", "It\u2019s also made clear that OP has a much easier time bonding with his sister and mother, but that\u2019s not the point of the post. Dad wants to bond with his sons. Dad saw an opportunity for a \u201cguys\u2019 day\u201d and sprang for it. I\u2019m sure dad has other ways of bonding with his daughter, but this was something he wanted to do with his sons. If you\u2019re trying to make it a sexist thing, stop, and get some therapy.", "I've read many comments... This is your dad's problem. Does he even care about bonding with your sister? It seems he's just invested in his sons and is sad you don't conform to the other 2.  There are many options to bypass that... Such as individual time vs splitting by genders.\n\nI say surprise them with a trip to a drag show, if you and your sister enjoy them, and buck his traditional system until he changes his thought process. Otherwise, he keeps getting 0 times since the parent needs to accommodate the children, not the other way around.\n\nYour mom figured it out. He can ask her or a therapist for advice if he keeps failing. But none of this is on you.", "Hat sucks, don't feel bad about doing what you want though. Go have fun with your mom and sister. This is is a problem that he needs to to work on.", "So effectively he can do activities you and your sister don\u2019t like and it isn\u2019t unfair but if your brothers dislike it then it is unfair? Maybe point this out to him OP. You dad needs a little kick that he is lucky two of his kids have similar interests as him and he can\u2019t always pander to them because of it", "NTA Dad can choose an activity with just you or he can take a hike. He's the engineer of his own problems here!"]}
