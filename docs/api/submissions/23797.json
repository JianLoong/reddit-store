I (F25) have a close relationship with my brother (M27) despite our occasional disagreements typical of siblings.\n\nThe issue took place last weekend during a family gathering. We were all enjoying each other's company when my brother made a lewd comment about my appearance. It was entirely inappropriate and not the kind of remark you'd expect a brother to make about his sister.\n\nI immediately asked him to retract his words. He merely laughed it off, insisting it was a joke and telling me to lighten up. The rest of the family looked visibly uncomfortable but remained silent.\n\nAfter the gathering, I decided to confront him privately, reiterating that his comment was unacceptable. However, he stood by his 'joke' and claimed I was overreacting. He said it was just regular sibling banter.\n\nFeeling the need to stand up for myself, I informed the rest of the family about his behavior and the specific comment he made. I believed they had a right to know why there was tension between us.\n\nThe fallout was immediate. Many family members were appalled by his remark, and he has since been shunned from family activities until he apologizes and demonstrates understanding about why his comment was wrong.\n\nNow, my parents are claiming that I'm causing unnecessary drama and strain in the family by sharing what happened. They think I should have just shrugged it off because \"boys will be boys\" and that he didn't mean anything by it.\n\nSo here I am, feeling like I've done the right thing, yet facing backlash from my family.

I (F25) have a close relationship with my brother (M27) despite our occasional disagreements typical of siblings.\n\nThe issue took place last weekend during a family gathering. We were all enjoying each other's company when my brother made a lewd comment about my appearance. It was entirely inappropriate and not the kind of remark you'd expect a brother to make about his sister.\n\nI immediately asked him to retract his words. He merely laughed it off, insisting it was a joke and telling me to lighten up. The rest of the family looked visibly uncomfortable but remained silent.\n\nAfter the gathering, I decided to confront him privately, reiterating that his comment was unacceptable. However, he stood by his 'joke' and claimed I was overreacting. He said it was just regular sibling banter.\n\nFeeling the need to stand up for myself, I informed the rest of the family about his behavior and the specific comment he made. I believed they had a right to know why there was tension between us.\n\nThe fallout was immediate. Many family members were appalled by his remark, and he has since been shunned from family activities until he apologizes and demonstrates understanding about why his comment was wrong.\n\nNow, my parents are claiming that I'm causing unnecessary drama and strain in the family by sharing what happened. They think I should have just shrugged it off because \"boys will be boys\" and that he didn't mean anything by it.\n\nSo here I am, feeling like I've done the right thing, yet facing backlash from my family. AITA for telling the family about my brother's lewd comment, which led to him being shunned?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
