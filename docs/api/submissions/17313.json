That does seem like kind of a childish reason.\n\nHowever, it *is* a pool and this lady has to accept that her hair might get wet on accident, and she shouldn't have started screaming and insulting you.", "Nta.   Swimming pools are full of water.  If she didn't want wet hair, then she should either wear a swimming cap or find a different form of exercise/chatting place", "ESH\n\nYou missed the \"using your words to ask\" step before you decided to passive-aggressively splash them.

I'm slightly older than you and have swam competitively.  I used to workout at the local YMCA which had designated swim lanes.  Some times an elderly person who wanted to water walk or just float would jump into my lane.  I always paused and asked if they were ok splitting the lane or swimming circles.  It took a whopping 5 seconds out of my workout for some basic consideration. Out of 100s of trips to the Y, I only had one issue where an old lady yelled at me for the same thing - I splashed too much while I swam and I got her hair wet.  I reminded her she was swimming in a pool and left it at that.\n\nFrom your comments, it sounds like there was no designated swim lane, hence it was an open \"shared\" pool.  Everyone could have benefited from some quick communication, but no one took any initiative to do so.   Instead, you took turns sniping.  Congrats, you're both AH.", "ESH. I was a D1 swimmer. Lordy I know how annoying these situations can be. But they may not know if they didnt grow up in that environment. There wasnt lane swimming nor posted rules. You were way rude and could have solved this problem by asking them to give you a lil space.

Your way of communicating feels off.", "YTA. I\u2019m a swimmer as well, but unless a pool has dedicated lap swimming you aren\u2019t entitled to an entire length of pool. Part of the deal with lap swimming during rec hours is you\u2019ll lose your \u201clane\u201d if the rec swimmers take up residence in your path. Extra YTA for splashing on purpose and cursing at her.", "YTA - It's a public pool that *doesn't do lane swimming*. The first time you went by them and pushed them out of the way could *maybe* be excused as an accident (but, really, how fast are you swimming that you \"couldn't stop in time\"?), but then you kept doing it. On purpose. Without ever bothering to stop and say \"Hey, I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm doing laps here, would you mind moving over slightly so I can finish up?\" And if there was plenty of room on the other side of the pool for them to stand, then there was also plenty of room on the other side of the pool for *you to swim*. Then, when they continued to try to enjoy the shallow end of the pool, you started deliberately splashing them? \n\nYou were absolutely the AH in this situation. They were right, you *were* being rude and inconsiderate. It wasn't their fault that her hair got wet, it was yours for *deliberately splashing her.*", "YTA - There was no lane swimming.    Next time ask them to move before being passive aggressive.", "I think this is definitely an ESH situation. \n\nBut my real question is why did you post here in bad faith when you clearly have no intention of hearing any other perspectives? You just want validation that what you did was fine, and are arguing back with anyone who points out that your actions were immature and unnecessary. You posting here and your comments back are just as childish as your actions at the pool.", "ESH if there was no one else in the pool and you could have moved over slightly it would have made no difference to you and you did soak them intentionally. But they're also the AH for getting in the way of someone obviously swimming laps. And complaining about wet hair in a pool needs to have a word with themselves.", "ESH   why wouldn\u2019t you just tell them to please move? If you did that then you would have been in the right. You splashed them on purpose so they get to be upset about it. There also isn\u2019t an expectation to stay dry at a pool.", "ESH. You could have moved over yourself, or asked them politely to move. For their part, anyone afraid to get their hair wet needs to stay the heck out of a pool.", "YTA I am a swimmer too, and do laps too all the time, it isn't hard to move to other side, plus it is a public pool, people are always going to be in the way.", "They were probably in the shallow end because of their hair and didn\u2019t realize that you were doing laps. A lot of women pay a ton to straighten their hair. If they don\u2019t know pool culture they probably thought as long as they are standing in the shallow, their hair would be ok. They shouldn\u2019t have called you names but you also shouldn\u2019t have told them to fuck off.", "You splashed them on purpose because \"they got in your way\" and you couldn't be bothered to ask them nicely to move.\n\nThis is a public pool with no swimming lanes, they can talk wherever they want.

So floating/standing on one side is acceptable as much as your laps.", "ESH. You, for splashing them on purpose. Them, because they didn't move out of your way.", "Did you say anything to them prior to splashing them? If not, then ESH.  If you did, then that was a bit rude but not as rude as their standing in your way.\n\n(This is why I swim at 5am - no malingering to swim around.)", "YTA. This is a public pool and not a private swimming pool for your exclusive use \u2014 if somebody gets into a section of the pool you\u2019d like to swim through you\u2019re in no way entitled to physically barge them out of the way, splash water over them and then swear at them in the changing room.", "ESH. It's a public pool with no designated lane for swimming laps.  You're not entitled to force your way through others to do laps.\n\nCrying to the manager over hair getting wet at a pool is too much.", "If you want to swim laps, you go to a lane swim, not a public swim.\n\nYTA", "YTA - Please don\u2019t take up cycling", "ESH, as you didn't even try to ask them to move, and that excuse about losing your focus is pretty weak, as you were clearly already losing focus being annoyed by them and making a big a splash as possible. That being said, if the entire pool is available, its pretty ridiculous to be in the one spot where you're in the way of a person swimming laps.
