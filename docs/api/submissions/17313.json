I couldn\u2019t stop in time and pushed from the wall between them forcing them to move aside.\n\nI was being more careful next lap but they just kept standing there. There was plenty of space on the other side of the pool where they could stand and chat without bothering anyone but they chose to stand right in front of me. \n\nSo I continued swimming pushing from the wall. If they refused to move, I just turned in water making sure to make a big splash.\n\nI took a break to drink some water and one of them started screaming at me how I got her hair all wet. Told her it\u2019s her fault and continued swimming.\n\nShe waited for me in the changing rooms and went on about how I was inconsiderate and I ruined her hair.\n\nI told her to fuck off. She started going off at me and started screaming calling me an asshole an a bitch.\n\nI grabbed my stuff and went to one of the cubicles to have a shower and change. When I was leaving they were talking to the manager, one of them was crying about her hair. \n\nI told my sister and she thinks I was an asshole but I didn\u2019t think so before. Now, with my sister agreeing I worry that I might have been. AITA?\n\nEdit: just to add, I was the only person there when they came in. They had the whole pool to stand, they chose to purposefully stand in front of me, without swimming at all.\n\nEdit2: the pool is 25m long and you swim length wise, from deep to shallow end and back. They had whole shallow end wall free except for the meter or so I used for kicking off. I didn\u2019t take the whole shallow end. who would do laps there (except for kids)? \n\nEdit3: while there\u2019s no designated lap lanes, lap swimming isn\u2019t forbidden. Typically, during open swim, 75% of swimmers do lap swimming.\n\nEdit4: they weren\u2019t older ladies, they were about my age (early30s)\n\nEdit5: i didn\u2019t leave the pool to grab water, I had water on the edge along with my other stuff for drills or my ear plugs, etc. This is perfectly normal and acceptable.", "created_utc": 1684172608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ievu5/aita_for_splashing_women_with_water_at_the_pool/", "score": 5964, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm slightly older than you and have swam competitively.  I used to workout at the local YMCA which had designated swim lanes.  Some times an elderly person who wanted to water walk or just float would jump into my lane.  I always paused and asked if they were ok splitting the lane or swimming circles.  It took a whopping 5 seconds out of my workout for some basic consideration. Out of 100s of trips to the Y, I only had one issue where an old lady yelled at me for the same thing - I splashed too much while I swam and I got her hair wet.  I reminded her she was swimming in a pool and left it at that.\n\nFrom your comments, it sounds like there was no designated swim lane, hence it was an open \"shared\" pool.  Everyone could have benefited from some quick communication, but no one took any initiative to do so.   Instead, you took turns sniping.  Congrats, you're both AH.", "ESH. I was a D1 swimmer. Lordy I know how annoying these situations can be. But they may not know if they didnt grow up in that environment. There wasnt lane swimming nor posted rules.

Your way of communicating feels off.", "YTA. I\u2019m a swimmer as well, but unless a pool has dedicated lap swimming you aren\u2019t entitled to an entire length of pool.

The first time you went by them and pushed them out of the way could *maybe* be excused as an accident (but, really, how fast are you swimming that you \"couldn't stop in time\"?), but then you kept doing it. On purpose. Without ever bothering to stop and say \"Hey, I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm doing laps here, would you mind moving over slightly so I can finish up?\" And if there was plenty of room on the other side of the pool for them to stand, then there was also plenty of room on the other side of the pool for *you to swim*. Then, when they continued to try to enjoy the shallow end of the pool, you started deliberately splashing them? \n\nYou were absolutely the AH in this situation. They were right, you *were* being rude and inconsiderate. It wasn't their fault that her hair got wet, it was yours for *deliberately splashing her.*", "YTA - There was no lane swimming.    Next time ask them to move before being passive aggressive.", "I think this is definitely an ESH situation. \n\nBut my real question is why did you post here in bad faith when you clearly have no intention of hearing any other perspectives? You just want validation that what you did was fine, and are arguing back with anyone who points out that your actions were immature and unnecessary. You posting here and your comments back are just as childish as your actions at the pool.", "ESH if there was no one else in the pool and you could have moved over slightly it would have made no difference to you and you did soak them intentionally. But they're also the AH for getting in the way of someone obviously swimming laps. And complaining about wet hair in a pool needs to have a word with themselves.", "ESH   why wouldn\u2019t you just tell them to please move? If you did that then you would have been in the right. You splashed them on purpose so they get to be upset about it. There also isn\u2019t an expectation to stay dry at a pool.", "ESH. You could have moved over yourself, or asked them politely to move. For their part, anyone afraid to get their hair wet needs to stay the heck out of a pool.", "YTA I am a swimmer too, and do laps too all the time, it isn't hard to move to other side, plus it is a public pool, people are always going to be in the way.", "They were probably in the shallow end because of their hair and didn\u2019t realize that you were doing laps. A lot of women pay a ton to straighten their hair. If they don\u2019t know pool culture they probably thought as long as they are standing in the shallow, their hair would be ok.

So floating/standing on one side is acceptable as much as your laps.", "ESH. You, for splashing them on purpose. Them, because they didn't move out of your way.", "Did you say anything to them prior to splashing them? If not, then ESH.  If you did, then that was a bit rude but not as rude as their standing in your way.\n\n(This is why I swim at 5am - no malingering to swim around.)", "YTA. This is a public pool and not a private swimming pool for your exclusive use \u2014 if somebody gets into a section of the pool you\u2019d like to swim through you\u2019re in no way entitled to physically barge them out of the way, splash water over them and then swear at them in the changing room.", "ESH. It's a public pool with no designated lane for swimming laps.  You're not entitled to force your way through others to do laps.\n\nCrying to the manager over hair getting wet at a pool is too much.", "If you want to swim laps, you go to a lane swim, not a public swim.\n\nYTA", "YTA - Please don\u2019t take up cycling", "ESH, as you didn't even try to ask them to move, and that excuse about losing your focus is pretty weak, as you were clearly already losing focus being annoyed by them and making a big a splash as possible. That being said, if the entire pool is available, its pretty ridiculous to be in the one spot where you're in the way of a person swimming laps. Also, the idea of that one woman being so upset that her hair might get wet while she's IN a pool is pretty hilarious.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Regardless of the reason why, wouldn't you flip out on someone who was perceived to being rude to you for no reason? Even if it wasn't about her hair getting wet.
