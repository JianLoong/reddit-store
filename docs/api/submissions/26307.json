Very dangerous and sometimes lethal.  \n\nYou're not told nil by mouth for fun - it's a safety issue.", "NTA.

There's a reason we tell people not to eat X hours before surgery. Otherwise you run the risk of aspirating vomit if you throw up during surgery. Which many people do. You'll have a pipe in your throat to your airway, and vomit will go right to your lungs. That's called aspiration pneumonia and it's deadly.", "He could die by asphyxiating so yeah you did the right thing.

Why does he think they have these rules.", "When I had my surgery for breast cancer, they told me: \"No water or food since midnight the day before\", and so I did.\n\nIn the pre-operation room a nurse asked the patients if the rule had been respected. The woman in the bed next to mine said she had tea that morning because she was thirsty. They sent her back to her room and postponed the surgery for 6 hours.\n\nThere's a reason for that, and I can't imagine what would have happened if they had operated on that man who had just eaten \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHe's about to have surgery and isn't listening to what nurses told him not to do?

Basically, your body can no longer keep the contents of your stomach in your stomach. \n\nWhen it's a bit of stomach acid, *maybe* a little water, it is serious but it can be managed. If there's anything else and you aspirate? It becomes dangerous and maybe even deadly.

While technically he can decide to risk his own life, you and the rest don't have to sit by, let it happen, and potentially live with the guilt.

They postponed to the next day and everything turned out fine except for my sister's grudge.", "Apparently lots of people ignore that instruction. I went in for surgery with a 9 AM scheduled start time and the anesthesiologist asked when had I last eaten. My answer was 8 PM the night before. He asked when had I last had something to drink.

I\u2019ll just have a couple of squares of chocolate to tide me through.

Really smart advice.", "People who eat or drink before a surgery can die choking on food or drink in their lungs. It isn't a pleasant way to go.", "Really.  Is there a reason only you are aware off that eating before an operation is ok?", "Even if you don\u2019t care about the individual it still matters.\n\nIf he aspirates on his stomach contents and needs to be ventilated on ICU that\u2019s going to take that operating theatre out of action for a few hours and operations will be cancelled - so it does affect the other patients. Also do you really want to go to surgery with a team who are shaken up after their last patient nearly died on the table?", "Username checks out.  \nUserflair checks out with IQ too.........", "Do you regularly say that to people who are trying to protect others from being in life threatening danger? Especially when their life will also be on multiple other people's consciences?", "In most civilized countries, they give you a paper to sign called \"written consent\". It contains the objectives and risks of the medical procedure you will go through and it is a legal obligation before any major surgery.\n\nWhat i've observed is thad most people sign it without reading, then complain about not knowing things i wrote in there. So i just started ripping the document in front of them as a bit of a tantrum before making them sign a new one and asking them to read before signing. \nYou can die in a surgery table and you need to know that", "Have you ever asked?", "On the other hand, people in car accidents etc who are operated on as emergencies MUST be operated on without having fasted beforehand.", "yeah, exactly. In case of EMERGENCIES. Not because someone \"doesn\u00b4t want to\". Also, in emergencies they know they have to intubate differently. In that case he would have hidden it and lied and they would have assumed, he sticked to the rules.", "look after enough patient who aspirated their stomach content into their lung. Not fun for the anesthetist nor the patient who ended up in ICU requiring ventilatory support post procedure.", "RN here. They don\u2019t intubate differently when someone has eaten recently. They just decide that the risk of aspiration is less than the risk of a bad outcome by waiting to do surgery. That\u2019s what makes it emergency surgery. It needs to be done ASAP.", "My mom's a retired surgical nurse and told me that procedure that they typically use for those situations.  It's horrifying.\n\nA nurse places their finger or thumb at the tracheal notch (the divot where your neck, rib cage and sternum meet) and presses *hard* to block the airway.  Then when they feel the tube bump into their finger, they move their hand.  They also have to use different drugs until they get the patient intubated to reduce the risk of aspiration and my mom said they weren't always that effective at completely knocking the patient out (they've gotten better).  So, the person was aware of what was going on and felt like the nurse was choking them but couldn't move to fight off the nurse.\n\nNow my mom retired in 2018 and said that she had seen improvements, but she also got out of emergency surgery and was in scheduled outpatient pediatric surgery instead, but that was the procedure she had to use a few times.", "But that's his choice.

I\u2019m referring to exactly the kind of person in this post, who ignores even verbal warnings, that they need to be literally told: don\u2019t eat before surgery, there\u2019s a risk you could die if you do.\u201d", "Civilised countries? What does that mean?", "Yes I was given vague responses. \u201cIt\u2019s not good.\u201d", "It shouldn't be the patient's job to know what questions to ask.

Why?", "It is absolutely a patient's job to ask. You can't expect random people to prioritize your health and well being--you need to be your own advocate. I'm not saying to argue with medical staff--but at least try to understand what is going on so you can decline something if it's not needed (say unnecessary opiates or anti anxiety medicine) or understand why something is being instructed.", "You think surgeons are sitting around going through the details of a consent form? \n\nSay you don't work in medicine without saying you don't work in medicine.", "What?  That's not at all what I said. \n\nI am a doctor, I do not expect my patients to have ANY medical training.  If something is important to do or not do, I explain why, I don't expect them to make the right assumptions.\n\nThe average patient literally does not know what questions are good or bad, mostly they are just worried or scared.  So if I think there is information important to know, I'm not going to wait for them to ask.", "Doctor, did you read the original post? It's about a dude chowing down on chocolates just before receiving anaesthesia. And your response reads like Augustus Gloop there is not to blame because he didn't ask enough questions or something?"]}
