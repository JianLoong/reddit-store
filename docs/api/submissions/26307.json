That's why it's literally the worst residency to choose, extremely high risk and low reward. You need to be diligent and aware of everything regarding your patient, from prior health issues, hereditary conditions in the family, their bloodwork results, everything down to their weight, because a kg can make a difference.  General anaesthesia can be an enormous strain for the heart, even a healthy one.The allergic reaction is something you can't test for until you introduce the meds, and then they are basically fighting for your life. To willingly risk even more just for a meal when you can wait a few more hours or days and then eat your fill... well, it really proves one's IQ levels.", "Since you say \u201cwe\u201d I\u2019m thinking you may have some experience here.

I work in surgery and I always tell my patients ahead of time why they can\u2019t eat and it\u2019s news to so many of them, even ones who have been under anesthesia before.

There will always be those, the rules don\u2019t apply to me people like that guy.

It's not their fault people don't read the instructions they're given.", "If you are given instruction you don\u2019t understand them you should ask questions. If staff do not want to answer your questions that is a huge red flag that the procedure/surgery/ test should not be done at that facility. \nUnfortunately in our society a lot of people are scared to ask questions.

I told them my concerns (because I knew you shouldn't have anything in your stomach) and they said \"Oh! That's fine. At least we know! We can start by reducing your stomach contents and go from there\" I'm heavily paraphrasing (I was very out of it) but they basically said they had things that could mitigate the risk, like pumping the stomach, and an intubation method that could help block things from going into your lungs.\n\n... But they need to know something's in your stomach in order to do those things.  Definitely NTA.", "Yes, I was an EMT for 10 years and a MA for 20. In emergency situations you don't know. And there are extra special precautions they must take in those situations. But, emergency surgery will always top the \"did they eat\" scenario. However... In cases of planned, or elective surgeries, its much easier to not allow patients to eat/drink with the exception of sips of water with necessary medicine.

She would hand me a paper, and I would start to read it but while I was reading it, she would say \u201coh this is just XYZ, just sign here\u201d and then when I kept reading she would stare me down the whole time acting exasperated (staring at me, checking her watch, holding her hand over the paper to grab it the second I signed it) and we repeated that process like 6 times for each paged I signed. I wasn\u2019t getting surgery however so maybe it\u2019s different, but I would much rather have a doctor like you.", "I've had a bunch of surgeries with the same hospital. It's the same consent form for all of them that covers everything.

Because it was unexpected I had eaten that morning. I didn\u2019t throw up during surgery but was sick as a dog afterwards.

And I've had a few procedures that required being put to sleep. But it wasn't until I was 48 and had a colonoscopy that a nurse called before my procedure to go over, in extreme detail, everything that would be happening. And they had a very explicit section about vomiting food and/or liquid and choking to death. Or getting some kind of pneumonia related to the food getting into your lungs.  Scary stuff!", "Not calling you all dumb but I've been told by drs that sometimes they only explain as much as they believe the person will understand/or will care to understand. For example with my mother the drs kept it very basic bc she isn't the brightest then they would explain in detail to me what was going on", "Depends on your blood pressure and kidney function. Generally, too much salt isn't good for you, but if your kidneys are working well and your blood pressure is normal, you might be effectively filtering it out.\n\nIf your kidneys aren't working well, you will have trouble filtering electrolytes (ie: sodium) and might also retain fluid, which raises your blood pressure.\n\nPeople with high blood pressure can develop heart failure, because of how much harder your heart needs to work to pump blood throughout your body. Think of it like air pressure - squeezing a basketball that's partly full of air is easier than squeezing one that's overfilled.\n\nHigh sodium means your kidneys retain more water to keep your system balanced, and therefore impacts the work your heart needs to do to pump blood.\n\nDoes that help at all?", "I bet people just *don't* have a question, or think they already know the answer and it isn't something that's actually a big a deal. Maybe they know what the risk is but think it's as low as the odds of winning the Megamillions jackpot, or believe it's something the doctors could relatively easily deal with, or they're confident it means don't eat a huge meal but a little snack is fine.", "thank you, you're wonderful! that does help", "Thanks for explaining this. I had an emergency surgery recently where they kind of explained all this while I was super out of it, so I didn't 100% know what was different about it, just that it was different and I should be ok.", "Thank you for explaining this. I've always wondered about the door-crashing \"A\" cases, they obviously don't have time to wait.", "For brief low risk procedures sometimes they'll use a laryngeal mask airway which means the tube isn't all the way down into your trachea but instead fits snugly into the opening in the back of your mouth. They always need a safe airway since when you are under general anaesthesia you don't breathe on your own.", "No. They don\u2019t.

Afaik that is supposed to be standard practice.  *Every* instance I have had with anesthesia - about two dozen in my life, various types, some full anesthesia, some partial - they did that, whether here *or* overseas.  The risks are just too high.\n\nThe only instance I ever witnessed where that was not the case was in an emergency situation.  My wife had an ectopic, it blew, she was in shock and not responding, the nurses were trying to talk to her, the doctor saw that and totally blew his gasket and said that he would authorize emergency surgery.  Afaik that kind of life-or-death situation is the only instance where they are protected without an informed consent.  They don\u2019t take that step easily either.\n\nAs far as gotchas are concerned, or jokes\u2026 bless your heart\u2026 the last sentence in your post reads \u201cSay you don\u2019t work in medicine without saying you don\u2019t work in medicine.\u201d  If there is ever a snarky comment, that is one\u2026 and judging by the responses here, including mine, it is broadly untrue.\n\nLike I said, I\u2019d be worried about the folks you\u2019re seeing if they\u2019re not extending that very common (and highly recommended if not even *required*) practice to you.  They are potentially opening themselves up to malpractice suits if anything ever happens or gets close.  That\u2019s not someone I\u2019d frequent.  Please be careful.  Check your state\u2019s requirements on that, that of their boards, that of their insurers.  Any and all of those may require it; I would, period.\n\nInformed consent is exactly that: they have to inform you of the risks involved, and you have the right to ask any questions around the issue and have it explained to your satisfaction.  Only then do you sign that form.  If they give you a paper to review and sign, you can do that, but you can also go ask questions, and they have to answer.", "No I think not obtaining informed consent before performing medical procedures could very appropriately be described as \"savage\" and \"impolite\".", "Oh, no.

Their explanations are generally bad too!\n\n(I have a sense of humor about all this, but it's a real problem.)", "I'm referring to detailed perioperative care. I'm not the only one who has had their surgeon breeze in and let the support staff handle the rest of care. I could tell a story about how long my nurses spent trying to even get some information from the doctors, but that's not the point. \n\nIt's great that your experiences have been different, and I hope your wife is better. But those of us who didn't have the option of highly involved doctors aren't stupid or lazy or making poor choices.", "Where are you talking about that this happens?"]}
