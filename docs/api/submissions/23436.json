Poor dental hygiene is also linked to low birth weight and premature birth, erectile dysfunction and low sperm count, kidney disease, and pancreatic, kidney, and blood cancers; it can cause or worsen atherosclerosis, leading to increased risk of heart attack and stroke; it increases the risk of developing pneumonia, COPD, and dementia; it can worsen diabetes; and it can lead to endocarditis.\n\nSo while this particular blow-up was about OP wanting her husband to wash his hands, the overall situation is not just about OP's husband not washing his hands \u2013 though I'll bet you any amount of money that he also rarely, if ever, washes them after using the toilet.

The use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers when soap and water are not available irritate your skin less than soap, but they do not get rid of all types of germs. Only soap and water are able to wash away the visible dirt or grease on your hands. Unfortunately the very products you use to keep your hands clean and even the water itself are stripping the skin of your hands of the much-needed barrier that is there to protect them from damage.\n\nIn a study conducted to investigate the effect of skin damage due to repeated washing, it has been found that frequent handwashing over a long period of time can cause long-term changes to the skin, resulting in skin conditions such as chronic skin damage, irritant contact dermatitis and eczema. Moreover, damaged skin can increase the risk of harbouring and transmitting infectious microbes.\n\nSo how can you keep your hands healthy and still be hygienic?\n\n1. Use warm water\n\nWarm water\nDon\u2019t use hot water to wash your hands as this strips the skin of natural oils that it needs to stay waterproof. Hotter water does not mean cleaner hands. Washing in warm water with sufficient soap will do just as well.\n\n2. Choose your soap wisely\n\nSoap can have a drying effect on the hands so be sure to pick a moisturising soap. Look for products that say moisturising on the packaging and with ingredients such as glycerine and lanolin. Choose liquid soaps instead of the bar variety as the binders that hold soap bars together contain high pH levels that can dry out your skin. Avoid perfumed soaps as these can irritate already chapped or dry skin.\n\n3. Be gentle\n\nAs well as choosing a more gentle soap to wash with, do take care to use gentle actions when washing your hands. We have a tendency to rush through the washing process due to busy schedules, but take care not to be too aggressive as this can aggravate the skin.\n\n4. Make hand cream your best friend\n\nHand cream\nAs you apply water to your hands while washing, the water acts like a magnet drawing out existing moisture from the deeper layers of your skin, which will also contribute to drying your skin out. So you need to replenish the moisture in your skin after washing. Have a handy tube of hand cream next to your hand soap, or carry a tube around with you so that you can apply immediately when you need to. You can also apply it before you go to bed and any time your hands feel dry. Select cream or ointment varieties rather than lotions as lotions have too high a water content in them and don\u2019t provide the barrier your skin needs.\n\nApplying hand cream will:\n\nincrease the moisture content of the skin\nrestore the barrier function of the skin\nprovide a protective film\nsoothe the skin\nimprove the skin\u2019s appearance and keep it soft\n5. Treat your hands to a soothing mask\n\nFor added care, and to ensure the surface moisture sinks in, especially if you suffer from dry, chapped hands, try a mask treatment. To do this, soak your hands in clean water for 5 minutes, apply a thick layer of moisturising cream or Vaseline, and slip your hands into a pair of cotton gloves for the night. Leave the gloves on for around 8 hours. This treatment will also help when travelling to colder climates where the cold and wind can severely dry your skin.\n\n6. Switch to hand sanitiser\n\nIf you still find your hands drying out, consider switching over to a hand sanitiser instead of soap. This reduces the amount of water you need to use. However, do bear in mind that hand sanitiser is no substitute for soap for washing hands before eating, after going to the bathroom and when your hands are visibly soiled. Be aware also that the most effective hand sanitisers contain high levels of alcohol and this can have a drying effect as well.\n\nDry thoroughly after washing\nDry thoroughly after\nUse a cloth or paper towel to dry your hands thoroughly after washing as germs are more easily picked up on wet hands. Again be gentle with your hands and blot rather than rub so you don\u2019t irritate the skin. Replace cloth towels in your home every 3 days and ensure that each family member has their own towel to use.\n\nWhen should I wash my hands?\nWhile it is important to wash your hands regularly for basic hygiene and to reduce the risk of viral infections, over-washing can actually compromise your immune system. You need to expose your body to a limited amount of potential harmful pathogens to train your immune system to fight it and make it better able to respond when your body comes into contact with foreign bacteria and viruses. Wash your hands:\n\nAfter using the bathroom or changing diapers.\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\nAfter touching animals or animal waste.\nAfter touching garbage.\nAfter coming into contact with bodily fluid or after sexual activity.\nBefore, during and after food handling.\nBefore and after contact with a sick person.\nBefore and after treating a cut, sore or wound.\nWhenever they feel or look dirty.\n\nNOTE THE NEED FOR GERMS TO STRENGTHEN OUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS...and note that it does NOT say to wash your hands after being out in public...which, in my 53 years of life, have NEVER seen anyone do unless they had been doing farm, mechanic or yard work or playing in mud.", "On paper, this reads like N T A, but i have a hard time believing details aren't being left out to make it seem that way. \n\nESH", "So - \n\n#1: NTA\n\nBut just to play devil's advocate for a second...\n\nMy wife has mysophobia and, I understand her *idea*, but it's constant. \n\nEvery time we get back in the car running errands it's hand sanitizer.

So I came up with a plan.  \n\nI would call when I was almost home from work.  I'd strip down to my underwear in the garage.  Then I'd knock on the door to the house, so my husband or kid could open the door, and I wouldn't even touch it.  I'd walk straight to the bathroom, wash my hands, strip the rest off, and then take a shower; and they would close all the doors behind me.  Sometimes, they would be sweet and even start the shower for me, so i didn't have to worry about that!  \n\nThe big rule was that no one could touch/hug me until I had showered and had clean 'at home' clothes on.  I also left my scrubs in the garage for at least 3 days, and only then would I bring them into the house to wash them.

(of course, not confirmed, confirmed , but I contact traced myself lol)", "I find it so baffling when men justify skid marks with a stupid ass reason such as \"wiping my ass is GaYYYyyyYyy\". They swear basic hygiene is either for women so they dont want to be seen as gay (which makes 0 sense) or they just genuinely be dirty and unhygienic and dont see the reason to wash their ass or hands", "Dont you feel the yuck on your hands? I don\u2019t wipe down my car as often as I should so even touching my steering wheel my hands feel grimy. Front door handle, car door handle, pushing shopping carts around, grabbing items from store shelves, etc. Idk why but the older I get, the more conscious I am of hand grime and I cannot stand it. I probably wash my hands 20 or more times a day.", "I'd do it because I'm ever so slightly disabled . Not noticeable but I use handrails a lot. So without gloves I'd pick up a lot of germs. And I know from a pathologist friend that a lot of people never wash their hands. So I wash my hands because I touch a lot of stuff and don't want to get norovirus. If you are out and about and not touching handrails in public it won't matter. And you are young enough to have a thriving immune system.", "My husband and I have both done this since we were small; washed our hands after being away from home. He\u2019s from New England in the US and I\u2019m from Finland if that helps with the region question?", "Thank you all for this response chain, I can't believe I'm supposed to wash my hands after literally going outside. No wonder the internet needs teaching how to touch grass, for fucks sake \ud83d\ude02", "I just DONT UNDERSTAND. It\u2019s wild.\n\nMy hand washing habits were the same as they are now before COVID. They stayed the same during COVID. I literally changed nothing I do and made no extra effort to be more sanitary besides wearing a mask in public\u2026 Ive always tried not to touch public surfaces unless I have to, don\u2019t touch my face in public or with dirty hands, try to sneeze or cough into the neck of my shirt if I\u2019m around others, avoid contact with people if I am feeling sick, use hand sanitizer before touching my steering wheel if I pump gas\u2026 like nobody already did these things? Seriously? That\u2019s pretty fucking gross.", ">preferably soon after you finish eating\n\nYou're actually not supposed to do that from a dental hygiene stand point. At least not if you had something sweet or acidic. Your mouth PH levels have to normalize, otherwise you're basically scrubbing your teeth enamel away because there's too much acid from the meal left. \n\nBut other than that, it's exactly how my parents taught me.", "Like, I don\u2019t make people take off their shoes when inside my house but it\u2019s typically just my husband and I. We prefer our shoes being off so we do remove them when we come inside.", "Oh yeah the yuck on my hands makes me wash my hands.", "To say people who haven\u2019t heard of washing hands after coming home means that we are \u201cbaffled\u201d by hand washing is ludicrous. \n\nLiterally nobody in my life has ever washed their hands after coming home from running errands just because they arrived home. Before food prep and after bathroom use? Of course. After running errands? Nope. \n\nOf course we washed our hands after coming home during the pandemic, but otherwise \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I've found my people! I do all of the above. I still wear a mask at the doctor/hospital, still wash my shopping down and still carry hand sanitiser around with me.", "The issue is not germs but germs from strangers that could be sick. Unless you\u2019re super gross, you aren\u2019t getting sick from the surfaces in your house covered in your germs\n\nPeople go out in public sick all the time. Kids/babies especially. And they\u2019ll open mouth cough all over everything. Which is why many ppl wash their hands before eating/once they get home from a public place. It\u2019s not after every door handle/surface, just before eating or touching your face, eyes, etc."]}
