Going for a name that's after one of the human characters wouldn't be as bad, as you can play it off as a coincidence even if it wasn't, but Rowlet is a bit different. And the kid is going to know very obviously that his middle name will be after the Pokemon because he's going to see the pictures and objects around him and put two and two together. I can see that definitely being embarrassing for the kid in the future, and could lead to teasing/bullying if other kids find out and realize the name (or if he reveals it himself; it may not pop up often, but I remember quite a few conversations about middle names as a kid and finding out that a lot of girls had \"Marie\" for a middle name).  \n\n\nYeah, it's a middle name and doesn't matter as much in the long run, as most people don't refer to it, but still... a child's name shouldn't be used as a prop to show off the parents' fandom loves. While there's plenty of children that grow up not minding and even joining their parents in loving the fandom their name came from, there's also plenty that grow to hate their names - whether due to bullying, feeling as though they can't be their own person outside of fandom, or some other reason - and that hatred is going to build into resentment. No idea what path this child will find himself on in the future, but one can only hope it's not the latter. But ultimately, in the end, you can't do anything to change your sister's mind.

Children make fun of other children because of certain traits they perceive to be abnormal, and a name can only make it easier. But it's not the name that is the deciding factor, imo. Sure, a name can change that very child's behaviour, if the child perceives its name as bad/shameful/ugly/stupid, but so can million other little things.

His cousins almost convinced him how great it would be to shout for Goku\u2026 lol \n\nOur child shares a name with a famous dog in an animated movie and with a villain in a new movie\u2026 \n\nPeople joke about the connections. It\u2019s ok. We don\u2019t mind it. The name we chose is because we love it and what it means to us. We are not on this earth to impress anyone. Remember that.", "My boyfriend's brother-in-law's name is Luke and his middle name is Skywalker. Rowlet is tame.", "...but that is an awesome middle name.", "What was your friend's kid middle name again? You just told me to wait for it but never gave the punchline", "I really like it for a first name! Row for short. I think it works for a girl or boy. Who cares what the inspo was it\u2019s not like she\u2019s naming the kid hashtag (which was a recent post on here and they were NTA for telling the person that\u2019s a terrible and cruel idea)", "IRC - Discord for old people \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d", "The fact that people instantly associate his name with the Ninja Turtles before the artists they were named after cracks me up", "Yeah maybe for a cat, or dog, or bird perhaps. For a human child that's going to have to explain that their middle name comes from a fandom they might not even like? Probably not.", "By then, he's going to have a graduation gown made of leaves with a sick hood.", "It's one thing if it's a unique name.  It's another entirely if the parent is trying to express their own personal love of a fandom or something by naming their goddamn child after it.  Like, love the child first, you fucking cringe weirdos!", "> won\u2019t cause much harm in their day to day life.\n\nHow considerate of you and the mom to shoulder the risk of that potentially being dead-wrong.", "I had a friend that gave their son the middle name \u201cDanger\u201d. Lol I love it. And most importantly, the kid also loves it. He uses it as his first name sometimes.  But now that he\u2019s a teen he uses the whole \u201cDanger is my middle name\u201d when meeting girls and they eat that shit up. I\u2019m ~~almost~~ jealous.", "It\u2019s basically onyx (which is really pretty btw) spelled wrong and\u2014let\u2019s face it: people who play Pok\u00e9mon are probably the only ones who don\u2019t get confused about the spelling of the mineral one.", "Yep, it would be equally bad if they were dragged to sports games regularly or forced to play parents' favourite sport every weekend, were never allowed to choose their own passions or interests because parents had decided what they were doing with their life for them.\n\nIt would even be equally bad if parents had planned out their life with musical interests and tutors and volunteering and extra curriculars that would help them on their path to med school.\n\nMy kid has a name that is technically from the Harry Potter series (not the main character and the name is pretty popular in other media and is a reasonably normal name) but she has never read the books/watched the movies/played with toys etc. I'm not a huge fan of the books myself, I just liked the name.", "I'm dying to know what the nickname is here", "My husband and his brother don't have middle names.  Parents said picking first names was hard enough.  Maybe I'll suggest he pick an unofficial one!", "I don't have one either! My parents couldn't think of anything that went well with my first and last names, so they decided I could choose one myself if I wanted. I tried a few middle names out in elementary school but nothing stuck.", "Since Rowlet is a surname of many of my cousins (Great-grandpa had 13 kids) and I've never heard of any of them being ridiculed about their name that goes back to the time of Henry VIII at least, I doubt it will be a problem at all.", "To be completely fair the person's middle name could be 'Howard' and if kids want to bully him, he'll get bullied for sharing a name with a Big Bang Theory character or something. I got made fun of for sharing a last name with the principal. Giving the child a traditional or untraditional name is irrelevant: if they are going to get bullied for their name, it doesn't matter at all what their name is. And people don't get bullied for their names; they get bullied, and the name thing is just added on to the pile of things bullies will use.", "Rowlet is a newer generation starter Pok\u00e9mon, so it\u2019s actually exactly like naming it charizard or blastoise to anyone who is a current fan. That\u2019s still her choice to make though.", "I've been asked my middle name growing up. But I think Rowlet isn't a bad middle name. Could be worse characters to name a kid after.", "I generally agree with your point, but I think you\u2019re underestimating how many people know the pokemon Rowlet in the younger generations. Rowlet is a starter Pok\u00e9mon for Gen 7, and is also one of the 3 Pok\u00e9mon featured on the cover of Legends Arceus, which is a really popular Nintendo Switch game. For kids who grow up with Gen 7, Rowlet would be on par with, if not more recognizable than charmander.\n\nMy 10yo niece knows who Rowlet is but no idea who Jigglypuff or Onix are, for example.", "I personally wouldn\u2019t have liked it as a name. That\u2019s all", "Every little school graduation I've had did use everyone's full name. A family tree project wanted our full names in elementary. And then everyone sharing their full name, and why they were named that, at least in 2 other grades. I know the origin of names for people I went to middle and high school with still because of this. At least none of them had a house full of figurines, etc, of the origin. That last bit is what really crosses the line for me, though. NTA.", "Probably Eevee (Evie)", "That\u2019s because most people have middle names like \u201cAnne\u201d or \u201cRay.\u201d I guarantee you if I found out one of my friends had a middle name named after a Pok\u00e9mon, I would not forget it.", "My middle name is unusual, because it's a name my mom made up combining her middle name and my dad's. It's similar enough to a common name that people just pronounce it wrong if they see it written down so if I ever need a middle name for anything I just put A. I also don't like my middle name anyway, so I literally only use it when I'm signing something and I put Firstname A. Lastname. I feel like that's what most people do. That kid won't be any different probably.", "My middle name is some long lost family bs and it has seriously affected my entire life. Names stick around forever, unless Rowlet goes down to the Social Security office and starts the process to change it, they are going to have to explain it at some point.", "Fr she really called me cheap when I was in the womb", "For the kid, it's also growing up with the fan name, even just in his own home. Imagine you're the child of a parent who really loves Harry Potter, and named you after him, but you also see the parent's obsession every day - models of Harry, posters of him, blankets, plush toys, etc. all around the house. Better believe that parent is absolutely also buying their kid a ton of Harry Potter clothes to wear. Even if nobody else ever makes the connection, the kid has to grow up knowing the parent even used naming them as an extension of their hobby/interest. If it were me, I'd probably feel at least a few times like the parent only cares about me as a walking display of their love for Harry Potter.", "Sure, but you will know it\u2019s not just a cool old timey name with history the moment you see the kids home is a shrine dedicated to a Pok\u00e9mon", "During prime bullying years though, Pok\u00e9mon is kind of cool? At least it was when I was in school\u2026", "That\u2019s my buddies rave name so yea, yea I can lmao", "\ud83d\ude02", "Better than gun names, like in my lovely Oklahoma town.", "Shhhh! Stop trying to drive up housing prices on Snorlax Lane! I\u2019m trying to buy a house, damnit", "Yeah, I used to work with someone with the surname Rowlett, so that was my first thought as well. If I came across someone called Rowlet irl I'd just assume it was a spelling variation.", "which is exactly how my great-grandfather and all his siblings and cousins pronounced their surname.  It's not my surname because I'm from a female descendant.", "Yeah, just the staff would know the middle name. And if the kid though it was dumb, he wouldn't share it with the other kids. I have never heard a school staff member use a kid's middle name for anything.", "Seriously. Might as well go ahead and name your kid Ham Sandwich and see how everyone likes him.", "Who has to explain why they have a given name? For real if someone asks why my middle name is Joshua what am I meant to say? \"It sounded good to my parents\"? In what circumstance are people going to care about what your name is? It's not a slur, it's not a notable fictional character, it's...a word. And most people are only going to see a word, not immediately link it to a Pokemon from their childhoods.", "But will that generation even know about Rowlet? Or care?", ">\tAny name can be a cause for bullying.\n\nThank you! Idk why people are bringing up the bullying aspect as if it\u2019s really gonna change anything. All four of my names got teased at some point growing up, and none of them are all that out of the ordinary except for my first one (and culturally it isn\u2019t that weird), and my first middle one.", "Yeah dude I\u2019m just saying that Rowlett is a name that could lead to that kind of tiring teasing", "It can be costly and a huge time suck to change your legal name. The sentiment of \"you can always change it\" makes it sound really easy but there's tons of hoops to jump through.", "I\u2019m currently 9 months pregnant. I\u2019ve been saying this constantly haha", "I love the name Rowan. Almost named my daughter that but I was out voted. Oh well, she has a different lovely name", "My first name is also Rowan and my last name ends in \"lett\" so I love Rowlet bc it's like someone smashed my names together. I carry a Rowlet card in my wallet that a friend gave me.", "My sons name is rowan & we call him Ro sometimes, but Rowie is so cute!", "Just like Hyacinth Bucket's name is pronounced \"bouquet\"", "Like..rolex?", "When it\u2019s being paired with an obsession with the Pok\u00e9mon, it does. The mother will for sure make sure the kid knows how their middle name is said and will refer to it constantly. I mean, the entire nursery is Rowlet themed. Outside the home, sure it doesn\u2019t matter because they don\u2019t need to tell people, but it is going to come up.", "Yes the logic is that you got bullied for a name that didn't fit in culturally.", "Ironically owls are pretty dumb birds but still amongst my favorite. One of the only bird species I can talk to casually as I go on walks in the woods, they\u2019re super vocal and responsive.", "not sure if you're a pok\u00e9mon fan, but rowlet is called a starter Pok\u00e9mon: there's only three for every generation of Pok\u00e9mon (very rare) and starters are the first Pok\u00e9mon you get so people form a lot of emotional attachment to the one they choose. starter Pok\u00e9mon are by far some of the most memorable, and also being a starter it was heavily featured in the anime, and there's a disproportionate amount of merch for it as a result. not to mention rowlet gets fan service for being cute. it's important enough that ten year olds in 2030 will still know what it is if they're into the franchise.", "There's over 600 and counting, unless they are hard core fans themselves it's unlikely they know every single pokemon in existence.", "Oh yeah, perfect time to be saying it then haha", "I want a buttery for breakfast now\ud83d\ude03", "She's still \"that Bucket woman\" to me. Lol . I would love to attend one of her candlelight suppers!", "Gotta keep up those appearances!", "No.  The Row part rhymes with \"cow\".", "Not popular enough for people other than diehard fans to recognise an obscure name from a fandom", "Ah, you're right. Thank you.", "And they can rotate their head like the exorcist!!!", "I knew someone in high school who wanted to name her future daughter Treasure Chest. I looked her in tge eye and told her it was stripper name and if wanted to fuck her kid up that would do it. But damn Treasure Box is way worse. Poor kid.", "True. And thanks \ud83d\ude02", "I know.\n\nThey said \"roh-let\", hence my \"rolex\".", "Repetition is key to build trust! Good luck with your Raven friend.", "Marijuana Pepsi Jackson is a real person. Google it. My sister went to HS with her.", "Eh I changed my name to something I just made up and it turned out later that it was a prominent surname on a bunch of medical equipment that I had never heard of until I moved states. My original name was my mom's surname (though definitely also common as a first). I don't see the issue.", "You da real MVP \ud83c\udfc6", "I just want to thank you for the wild ride that link sent me on. I ended up so deep in a thread on snapewives I forgot where I started, Rowlet is supremely normal compared to everything I just read!", "Thank you, person who knew cool crow facts!:)", "No worries\n\nMore ideas [https://youtu.be/l_jGNTXwAAM](https://youtu.be/l_jGNTXwAAM)"]}
