Going for a name that's after one of the human characters wouldn't be as bad, as you can play it off as a coincidence even if it wasn't, but Rowlet is a bit different. And the kid is going to know very obviously that his middle name will be after the Pokemon because he's going to see the pictures and objects around him and put two and two together. I can see that definitely being embarrassing for the kid in the future, and could lead to teasing/bullying if other kids find out and realize the name (or if he reveals it himself; it may not pop up often, but I remember quite a few conversations about middle names as a kid and finding out that a lot of girls had \"Marie\" for a middle name).  \n\n\nYeah, it's a middle name and doesn't matter as much in the long run, as most people don't refer to it, but still... a child's name shouldn't be used as a prop to show off the parents' fandom loves. While there's plenty of children that grow up not minding and even joining their parents in loving the fandom their name came from, there's also plenty that grow to hate their names - whether due to bullying, feeling as though they can't be their own person outside of fandom, or some other reason - and that hatred is going to build into resentment. No idea what path this child will find himself on in the future, but one can only hope it's not the latter. But ultimately, in the end, you can't do anything to change your sister's mind.

Sounds serious tho, we should definitely warn the parents all over the world!\n\nJokes aside, i don't think a child's name has ever been the CAUSE of being bullied or made fun of, unless it's something completely ludicrous (\"Rowlet\" is definitely not). Children make fun of other children because of certain traits they perceive to be abnormal, and a name can only make it easier. But it's not the name that is the deciding factor, imo. Sure, a name can change that very child's behaviour, if the child perceives its name as bad/shameful/ugly/stupid, but so can million other little things.
