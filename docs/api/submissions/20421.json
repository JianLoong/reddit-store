While it ultimately isn't your business what name your sister gives her child, I'm definitely giving the side-eye to giving a Pokemon name to the child, even as a middle name. Going for a name that's after one of the human characters wouldn't be as bad, as you can play it off as a coincidence even if it wasn't, but Rowlet is a bit different. And the kid is going to know very obviously that his middle name will be after the Pokemon because he's going to see the pictures and objects around him and put two and two together. I can see that definitely being embarrassing for the kid in the future, and could lead to teasing/bullying if other kids find out and realize the name (or if he reveals it himself; it may not pop up often, but I remember quite a few conversations about middle names as a kid and finding out that a lot of girls had \"Marie\" for a middle name).  \n\n\nYeah, it's a middle name and doesn't matter as much in the long run, as most people don't refer to it, but still... a child's name shouldn't be used as a prop to show off the parents' fandom loves. While there's plenty of children that grow up not minding and even joining their parents in loving the fandom their name came from, there's also plenty that grow to hate their names - whether due to bullying, feeling as though they can't be their own person outside of fandom, or some other reason - and that hatred is going to build into resentment. No idea what path this child will find himself on in the future, but one can only hope it's not the latter. But ultimately, in the end, you can't do anything to change your sister's mind.

I would much rather have Rowlet tbh", "it's just a middle name, having kids doesn't mean she has to stop having interests. its cute that she passes them onto her kids even", "Counterpoint: How would they find out his middle name? That\u2019s not the kind of thing that comes up very often. I don\u2019t even know most of my friends and family\u2019s middle names.", "No kid would ever care about that lmfao. In fact I\u2019m sure if they found out the kids middle name, they would think it was pretty cool. It\u2019s also a middle name, that u don\u2019t even have to tell people if u don\u2019t want to. Honestly I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s that bad as a first name, let alone a middle name", "Thank you, I was thinking about the same one!", "My sister\u2019s also an immigrant in a largely white country so I admit I did have some fears about a well-meaning teacher asking the kid about it thinking it\u2019s something meaningful and deep in our culture and then he\u2019ll have to say, \u201cNo Miss Smith. My mother named me after an owl\u201d", "> even if it\u2019s just their middle name, can have some pretty major impacts on their life.\n\nHow so?\n\nSome people just don't use their middle names, and no one else knows what it is. Other kids could make fun of them if it's found out, but that's about the height of the damage I see it doing.", "Hey, thats sounds like a very interesting and at the same time very important study! I had no idea that the number of children named after a pokemon is big enough to warrant a scientific research. Would you be kind enough to share the link? I'm curious to see the percentage of lives destroyed due to being named after a pokemon. Sounds serious tho, we should definitely warn the parents all over the world!\n\nJokes aside, i don't think a child's name has ever been the CAUSE of being bullied or made fun of, unless it's something completely ludicrous (\"Rowlet\" is definitely not). Children make fun of other children because of certain traits they perceive to be abnormal, and a name can only make it easier. But it's not the name that is the deciding factor, imo. Sure, a name can change that very child's behaviour, if the child perceives its name as bad/shameful/ugly/stupid, but so can million other little things. So in the end, a name is hardly the culprit...\n\n... except \"Adolf\". That might be a little problematic.", "Because there is nothing to get.  It's fine for a middle name.  If it was a first name that would be much different, but how many people that you talk to do you even know their middle names?", "The child's name period is none of her business lol", "You can tell they were fans a little bit", "Dude, if someone wants to bully you, they can find 1000 ways to do it. Or do you think that all children who suffer bullying is by their middle name?", "That\u2019s also Raven, in Spanish. Frame it that way and it\u2019s awesome.", "I actually know a mom who named her daughter Tequila.", "Yeah, that's not how kids work. I've known a few people who actively hated their middle names, including my sister in law. Also, just because the parents are into something doesn't mean the kids will be. My niece hates harry potter because her mom shoved it down her throat her whole childhood. This kid is probably going to HATE Pokemon.", "Because young children ask each other stuff like that.", "Counter to your counterpoint: don\u2019t name your kid after your personality or interests", "That\u2019s true but it could honestly happen randomly. When the teacher is calling names first day of school. Whenever", "That\u2019s fine I personally think it can definitely be cause for bullying its more than just unusual imo", "Understandable, I would too. I can see how that could turn into something where the kid gets teased for it. But then again children are cruel and will tease you over almost anything. I just feel like this could make the child a bit of an easy target.", "It\u2019s on every piece of government documentation (or should be) such as IDs, licenses, passports, etc, as well as additional professional/official accounts such as bank accounts. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely not as hidden as some people may think.", "I go to a decently sized school, so all of our online stuff has our middle name included. Every time I comment on a forum for class you can see my whole name. My middle name is also part of my work id (admittedly not the whole name, my middle name is long). I've had to put it on plenty of forms over the years.\n\nI also distinctly remember all the \"what's your middle name?\" conversations in elementary school. Maybe it was just my school but there was a period where we were all obsessed with middle names.\n\nIt's not an at home nickname or a pet. It's a name a real human will be using, even if it isn't as widely used as the first or last name will be. I honestly don't think Rowlet is the worst possible choice, but I do wonder at all the people who act like no one will find out your middle name ever. I also think it's relevant to point out how annoying changing your name is, at least in the US, and you have to acknowledge that you changed it forever on important documents, so it's not like there's a super easy fix for shit names. Parents need to consider that they're naming a whole human who will have to navigate the world.", "I second this. Ravens are amongst the smartest birds. And they look pretty awesome too.", "Fair enough. The game Rowlet\u2019s from is gonna be at least 12 years old by the time he\u2019s in that situation though. It\u2019s a starter so they\u2019re probably going to pop up in media/merch until the pokemon company goes under, but I don\u2019t think small children in 5 years will immediately recognize it, you know? That\u2019s just hypothetical though.", "I do generally agree, but in this specific instance I think it\u2019s alright because Rowlett is a real name real people and a town in Texas have. Spelled slightly differently, but still.", "I\u2019ve never been in a situation where a teacher called out a middle name. It\u2019s possible, but it seems pretty unlikely.", "I'm thinking in terms of being a kid. Because when you're an adult, chances are no one cares and you can always change it. \n\nIf my middle name were Pikachu I'd get some jokes, but unless I was a kid it wouldn't be a big deal. Other kids I knew did have strange middle or first names, and it didn't destroy people's lives.", "Happened to me haha", "I stand corrected."]}
