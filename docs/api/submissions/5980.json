It's no fun that their boiler broke, and plans had to change so suddenly, but stuff happens.  That doesn't mean you should be expected to host at the last minute, like that!  That's an awful lot to ask for someone to take on hosting a large gathering like that.  You have nothing to feel badly about.", "NTA. So, the party gets canceled. Is that really a big deal? You are under no obligation whatsoever to host a party for them.", "Their last opportunity? Are they Ill? \n\nAnyway you have every right to say no. They can have a party when they get their boiler fixed. NTA.", "Hell no your NTA.\n\nIt's your home. You shouldn't have to feel you need to do anything you don't want to in your own home.\n\nYou didn't sign up to host a party. They did", "NTA. Everyone else is allowed to say they can't host except for you.", "NTA. They can find a nice restaurant to host dinner.", "NTA, they can go out to eat or rent a place if it's that important. Hosting is a massive chore", "NTA. Hosting is so much more than simply providing a space\u2014though prepping, providing, and cleaning up that space is definitely a big task. I could see you and your partner taking over if this were a small group of immediate family with whom you\u2019re close. But in this case, why can\u2019t someone else in the guest list take over\u2014someone with a large home and who enjoys being up late and playing host?", "NTA - wtf is going on with mom and dad that they feel bold enough to be mad at you for this! So sorry this is happening, I know it can be tough to have conflict with family, especially around the holidays.", "NTA. They asked; you answered with a perfectly valid response. Why don\u2019t they simply reschedule for when their boiler is repaired?", "NTA- you didn't agree to have the party in the first place, 12 people in a small place is not fun (plus all the stuff you have to do before, after, and during).\n\nI get that people like to celebrate on the holiday itself, but there's no reason your parents can't hold another gathering when their boiler is fixed. Other guests could step up.", "NTA, simply explain you\u2019re house is not capable of hosting that many people. And that you have other obligations (I\u2019m assuming if you\u2019re early sleepers you most likely are because of work and other responsibilities).\n\nIf they\u2019re not so nice about y\u2019all respectfully declining, then establish your boundaries and be honest. It was not your party to begin with, and you would rather not have some people on your house. \n\nOr even suggest throwing a party once they get their boiler broke? Have a new years themed party later on? Or just a family gathering in general. Good luck OP", "NTA\n\n**NO** is a complete sentence. Your reasons are your own. *\"No, I'm not interested in hosting a party.\"* is all you need.\n\nIf you keep circling back to feeling guilty, remember that your parents don't feel guilty about your reasons or your comfort level about taking on their party on short notice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m a little confused on why that can\u2019t get their boiler fixed ASAP? When our water heater died I was able to get it fixed the next day. Plumbers/HVAC etc are available basically 24/7 for emergencies, and a boiler not functioning in December is definitely an emergency. Party aside, don\u2019t your parents want to not freeze?", "I agree. Hosting is a huge ask, even for gatherings of half this size. You\u2019d have been incredibly generous to accommodate them but well within your rights to say no, OP. Plus, it\u2019s clear that the family doesn\u2019t have boundaries. This is a clear setting of a boundary.", "Add to this that they can ask the invited guests if they want to host instead of cancelling. Or they can move it to a restaurant or they can buy a bunch of plug in heaters. Or they can pay extra to find someone who can fix it ASAP.

They could rent a place. They could ask one of their guests. They aren\u2019t TA necessarily for asking, but you are free to say no, for any reason or no reason.
