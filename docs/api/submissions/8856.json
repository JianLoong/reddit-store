No.", "NTA\n\nYou were already engaged with watching the video before she even started talking to you. \n\nHow long was the video and does she typically expect you to pause things you're watching instead of waiting until you are finished?\n\nAnd you probably don't really care about her colleagues work problems anyway. Why's that need to be something she interrupts to discuss?\n\n It's like if you're reading a book and someone wants to talk. Just kinda of inconsiderate imo.", "NTA if she's taking 2 MINUTE pauses between bits of conversation (while presumably in another room DOING something else at the same time), why are you the rude one? Is she expecting you to sit around and wait for her to start talking again? she knew that you were doing something the first time she walked in, if she can't get everything she wants to say out in a reasonable amount of time, again while SHE'S also multi-tasking, then she can't expect you to be waiting with baited breath for her to pick back up again", "NTA. Based on your response that the pauses were 2mins and she was in a different room. Both actions would indicate that the conversations was over.", "NTA \n\nThere were TWO WHOLE MINUTE pauses! \n\nI mean we used to race upstairs and do the dishes in the two minute ad breaks.", "Nta. The pauses between conversations were 2 min AND she repeatedly left the room?. It is ridiculous to expect someone who was watching something to sit there waiting in the off chance that a person will come back into the room and contune talking.", "NTA.\nShe came into the room while you were already engaged watching the video. She proceeded to begin storytime without asking if you had a minute. She then proceeded to leave the room and keep pausing the conversation. \n\nIn future maybe some communication? Ask her to stay in the room and finish the conversation rather than talk from another room with long pauses in between?\nAnd she needs to literally read the room before she begins storytime. You were already doing something.", "NTA.  Oh man, my mother does this ALLLLLLLLLLL the time.  You could be reading, watching something, or working, it doesn't matter.   I'll have what I think is a full conversation with her.  To my knowledge, it's over, and then 3-5 minutes later, it's another couple sentences.  I go back to whatever I'm doing.  3-5 more minutes pass.  Turns out it's still not over, and so on, and so on.  She'll get super irritated because you're \"not really listening to her\" if you have to keep looking up from what you're doing.  No shit I'm not still listening after 5 minutes of silence because that is not how conversations work.\n\nI'm sorry.  I feel for you SO hard.", "NTA. This happens to me a lot with my mom. There are plenty of times when I think our conversation has come to an end so I press play on what I was watching and seconds after I do she starts talking again so I have to pause it again. So long as you\u2019re fully engaged in the conversation, like looking at her and responding to what she\u2019s saying, then I don\u2019t see anything wrong with starting your video again when it seems like the conversation has lapsed. Maybe try talking to her about it and explain that you thought the conversation had ended and that\u2019s why you pressed play when she stopped talking.", "INFO: How long were the pauses when you were restarting the video?  If they weren\u2019t longer than normal conversational pauses, then yeah, you were being rude.", "NTA - if you\u2019d ignored her then you\u2019d have been the AH, but you listened and responded so what\u2019s her issue exactly?", "NTA there's nothing I care about less than stories about someone else's work colleagues. Except maybe listening to stories about other people's dreams.", "What was she expecting you to do during those multiple minute gaps? Just wait for her to come back? NTA.", "I read a book many years ago that compared men's brains to waffles and women's brains to spaghetti. It was generalistic and full of pseudo-science, but this concept of thought processes stuck with me.\n\nBasically, the each waffle square and strand of spaghetti is equal to one train of thought or task. If you pour sauce on one strand of spaghetti it gets on all the ones nearby easily and all the strands are interconnected. If you pour syrup in a single square it takes a bit to get the syrup to the next square, and it's difficult to put it back in the first square.\n\nBasically your wife had two spaghetti strands going: the conversation and the bathroom stuff. You had two waffle squares: the conversation and the video. You stop the video, wait until you think she's done, then you go back to the video square. She's spaghetti-ing around. You're thinking 'this square is done, move to the next', but her spaghetti is still crossing. She wanted more communication, you thought you were done.\n\nNAH. Learn to communicate better from this.", "Advice: Next time, keep the video paused until you have both acknowledged the conversation is over.", "Mild ESH. Continuing to resume your video means you were not participating in this conversation. You were waiting for her to be done speaking, answering, then going back to your video.\n\nThat\u2019s ok, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being busy or in the mood to watch a video. But you did prioritize watching the video above conversation with her which is mildly AHish to your wife.\n\nYour wife saw you were watching something and that it had your attention. You had started this before she was even done with her shower, but she kept peppering you with conversation anyway and interrupting your watching which is a bit inconsiderate. So that mildly sucks too, though to be clear there\u2019s nothing wrong with a wife interjecting to talk to her husband.", "It's close. I think real-life interactions should be priority #1, but that's just an opinion and marriage is long. \n\nSometimes I'll tell my wife, \"Hold on, I want to finish this video, then I'll give you my full attention.\" Or after a convo, \"Is it ok if I keep watching?\" \n\nI get annoyed when she's screen-distracted, so I try to be aware of it myself. \n\nYou're NTA and she's NTA either.", "NAH / mild e.s.h.\n\nShe thought you were having a conversation. You didn't. Simple misunderstanding. No one need be an asshole for just not immediately understanding exactly what is going on in their SO's mind.\n\nBut yeah, she could been more clear able her intention to talk when you were clearly watching a movie. And you could have been more clear about letting her know what you were doing and responding more accurately when she asked.", "Was the conversation still ongoing about the same topic or were they different topics each time?\n\nI have a feeling you weren\u2019t quite paying attention to what she was telling you, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have resumed the video if the story she was telling you wasn\u2019t over yet.", "ESH.

Take the time to engage in a meaningful conversation with your wife about expectations.  Help each other understand what is wanted/needed when you are engaging each other.
