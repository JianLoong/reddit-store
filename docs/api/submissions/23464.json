I am 39 female currently married to my husband 42 male \u201cJ.\u201d Currently writing this in bed, alone, after a heated argument with my husband. He left to go to his brothers house. \n\nSo for some context, My husband J grew up in a pretty conservative, religious household while I, grew up almost the opposite. This may or may not be the reason for this disagreement and lack of being able to see eye to eye. \n\nSo heres the story: Last week my daughter had a pretty nasty ear infection which led her to being on antibiotics for about a week. She was taking the liquid version which is very foul tasting and very hard to convince her to take. In the past shes refused to try pills until this week after countless tantrums over the antibiotics. We first started with soft small things like a tiny cut up piece of her vitamin gummy then onto more solid things such as larger but still small sprinkles. After we both gained some confidence I had the great idea to give her one of my sugar pills out of my birth control packet as I never actually take them and I thought it would help her moving from things she usually eats to real medicine as sometimes theres mental blocks, learnt from experience. Also sugar pills wont have any physical affect on her like other medicines so I thought it was a great idea. \n\nShe manages to swallow it first go and we were estatic! She grabs the pill packet and runs to her father to tell him her accomplishment. He did not take it well at all. He walks into the kitchen fuming shouting at me asking what I was thinking and how stupid I am.. I thought he misunderstood and thought that I gave her one of the real pills and was concerned about her health so I explained it to him about the sugar pills but he replied with how that doesn\u2019t change anything and Im pretty much setting her up to be a \u2018s word\u2019 and that im normalising sex at a young age. I was absolutely baffled by this accusation but as I am not the confrontational type I just left the room and started crying. He soon ran off to his brothers house. \n\nHe has never behaved in this way before and Im honestly crushed. I never explained what the pills do to my daughter, only that they were mommy\u2019s pills that she cannot use without my permission and that the white ones are the only safe ones for her to consume just this one time for practice. Im to embarrassed to talk to my close circle incase they have the same reaction so Im asking some strangers instead.. Please let me know if I was in the wrong.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSmall Update/Clearing some things. \n\nThe comments have really opened my eyes and I know I have the responsibility to do something. I am going to talk to him and try my hardest to educate him but if he is not willing to listen and change his scary perspectives some further actions will be taken. \n\n- A lot are commenting about how I need to talk to my daughter about sex, protection, puberty ect. I have tried, but she expressed how she wasn\u2019t comfortable just yet. my plan was to wait but if theres any mothers out there that could give me advice surrounding that it would be great. \n\n-A lot are also commenting on how I should have used things such as tictacs, my idea around using the sugar pills were psychological. When I was young I could swallow peas and small candies no problem but when faced with an actual medicine pill, I had a mental block that lasted years so I wanted to eliminate that possibility with my daughter. \n\nAgain thank you for those who have opened my eyes and showed me my husbands actions were far from normal.", "created_utc": 1690695906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ddk9l/aita_for_giving_my_11_year_old_daughter_a_birth/", "score": 548, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lots of girls take birth control in order to control (or eliminate) their periods, without having sex. \n3. Again, your daughter is 11. Does she not know how the human reproductive system works? At least at a basic level? If she's not menstruating yet, she will be menstruating soon. She needs to understand what her body is doing.", "NTA.

I'm still not roaming the streets addicted to crack but it'll happen any day now...the joint opened up a gateway and we're on borrowed time.\n\nAnyhow, the whole thing is silly. It was one sugar pill, one time. It's pretty much the smallest pill you can find so I understand why you thought it was a good way to help her get over her fear.

Helps with cramps and makes you bleed lighter or stop bleeding entirely. And if someone if using them while sexually active? Who gives a shit it's modern-day medicine. But you literally just gave her a sugar pill , a pill that does nothing, so she can learn how to swallow antibiotics properly. That was it. Learning how to swallow pills is something she's gonna need to learn to do. For even simple things like ibuprofen. Your husband's an overtraumatic ass. \n\nNTA \n\nAnd if your daughter needs help swallowing a pill, the way I do it as an adult who sometimes struggles getting pills down, my process is as follows. \n\nHave water near, you that's ready to grab and chug in gulps. Put your hand into a fist and put your thumb in the fist and squeeze hard (this gives you something to focus on other than the pill in your throat). Toss pill into back of mouth. Chug water with now pill free hand. And if you're extra nervous about it, just pretend you're eating a food you really like and are swallowing it down.", "NTA. \n\nYour husband is ignorant and that\u2019s why he overreacted. He was too worked up to process that you did not give her actual birth control, you did not do it as part of a sex education talk, etc. He\u2019s blinded by emotions right now, maybe he will be more reasonable after he cools down? \n\nSorry you\u2019re going through this.

Also, birth control stops pregnancies produced by rape. \n\nNta", "NTA.

Only birth control pills could help her. She was chaste until 25 years old. \n\nYour husband needs to \"slow down there Tonto\". Birth control pills have a variety of uses. He married a woman. He needs to be educated on the female form and function. Or he will lead a very miserable life with not understanding the women in his household. \n\nNTA", "NTA Sl*t shaming an 11 year old over a sugar pill is a HUGE red flag for a serious personality disorder. It will get SO much worse when she is older.\n\nI am extremely religious and even i think he is completely out of line. Religion has nothing to do with how he behaved. \n\nDoes he speak poorly of his mother too?  Men like him usually do. You're next if he isnt already. \n\nMy ex blamed his own daughter for being assaulted and called her names even after police explained she was too young to consent even if she did. When they saw him working at walmart he purposefully went through his checkout line and shook his hand and invited him to thanksgiving dinner! \n\nThat is what your daughter's future could look like with a mysogynist father. It is time to seriously consider your options for keeping her safe. She is too vulnerable to withstand the abuse he will rain down on her as she goes thru puberty.", "NTA Your husband obviously some issues from his upbringing that he needs to address. Don\u2019t let him inflict his issues on your daughter.", "NTA. Your husband is dramatically overreacting, and it's bizarre to frame it as setting your daughter up to be a \"sl\\*t.\" That said, I do think it is a little weird (sorry) that you gave her a sugar/placebo pill. They have folic and iron in them usually (wouldn't hurt her, though). If she's swallowing little pieces of food, you should have just tried the actual medicine at that point.", "NTA", "NTA fer sure", "NTA - If your husband has very conservative views about sex then his reaction probably comes from a place of feeling \u201cambushed\u201d by a subject he\u2019s terrified of confronting. Even if his views aren\u2019t as conservative as his parents, he might have been caught by surprise that his instinctive reaction was parrot his parents\u2019 views. \n\nIf he genuinely feels like this is putting his daughter in some form of \u201crisk\u201d, his reaction wouldn\u2019t be to flounce off to his brother\u2019s, he\u2019d stay in the house out of a need to feel like he\u2019s protecting her. So at least on some level he probably knows this is about his views and not an actual \u201crisk\u201d to your daughter. \n\nHe needs to confront the realities of the world.", "NTA., and awesome job parenting your daughter. I wasn't sure this was going when I saw \"sugar pill\" and \"ear infection\" but helping her with her pill taking issue by starting small and working up that way showed a lot of sensitivity on your part. I'm pretty sure that's actually how the professionals help people with phobias.", "NTA. This is a bit of a red flag, does your husband have other stuff going on?? Man blew up over nothing. It's literally just a little sugar pressed into a shape. They literally exist to simulate taking a pill.", "Easy NTA.", "NTA - did your daughter hear this man say you were setting her up to be a s\\*ut? I assume that's what you mean by \"setting her up to be the S word\".\n\nSince when is birth control a mortal sin? Birth control can be used to manage acne, PMDD and even endometriosis, not only for contraception. There are so many young teens and women who regularly take birth control and who are not sexually active.\n\nDoes your daughter understand periods and how the reproductive system works? Does she know that pregnancy is not the worst thing that can happen to someone? I remember the first time I found out about STD's. No amount of pregnancy fear could've ever done what seeing a pictures of warts and syphilis did (I was 14 btw, not 11). She is 11 and this should have already been discussed. Overly conservative households tend to have a crap ton of teen pregnancies and that's because shame and control do not work. Your husband's attitude is creating an environment of secrecy with your daughter.\n\nIf she doesn't feel safe to come home and talk about things, she will just act out on them. She needs to feel safe to talk about boys, bodily changes and when the time comes, sex. It needs to be her choice to not want to have it. Mark my words on this here day, if your husband keeps this attitude up, the only time you will find anything out about your daughter is after the fact and probably from other people.", "NTA\nI dread to think how he\u2019ll behave when your daughter starts her sex life.", "NTA - although I find it odd to give medicine (even sugar pills) to your daughter when she doesn't get the prescription for herself, your husband sounds like an uptight person. Making a taboo out of the s*x when you are raising teenagers is the worst you can do IMO. And in any case, you just help your daughter heal from her ear infection", "ESH\n\nYou didn't have to say \"these are mummys pills you cannot take, but these ones are safe sugar pills.\"\n\nAll you had to do was say without showing her where they came from, \"Here is a sugar pill, they are to help you take medicine, but they don't actually give you a physical effect\"\n\nBut your husband is way over-reacting, after you explained he could have realised pretty quickly what you were trying to do, but his reaction about you setting her up to be a s\\*ut is concerning and a terrible viewpoint. That's worrying.", "NTA But I don't think all of the commentary about what they were was necessary and I def wouldn't have let her touch the rest of the packet. Just remove the pill, give it to her, and that's that. Lastly, tic tacs are typically the recommended way of introducing kids to plls.", "YTA for showing your daughter that it is okay to share prescription medications \u2014 this \u201cmommy\u2019s pills\u201d and safe to practice.   They are placebo pills and not sugar pills.\n\nTictacs would have been an appropriate substitute.", "You shoukd under no circumstance normalize taking another person's prescription or validating swallowing them as an accomplishment. Liquid or crushable medication is always an option, so pushing her to swallow pills doesn't need to be a thing until she wants it for her. Not for approval. While your husband's anger is off point. He has every right to be uoset at your poor parenting choice. \n\nAlso, why your birth control? Why not buy spme vitamins? You're normalizing uninfirmed drug use.", "ESH.   Those \u201csugar pills\u201d often contain ingredients not meant for kids, like iron.    You could have tried a baby aspirin or something other than a pill from your birth control pack.   That\u2019s just pretty stupid and risky.  Husband tho is over reacting.", "YTA.\n\nIt is hard to believe that someone got to be 11 years of age without ever taking a pill before. It is also hard to believe that a kid these days got to be 11 years old without knowing what birth control pills are.\n\nYou should never give someone your prescription drugs to take, not should you take anyone else's prescription drugs.\n\nBirth control pills can have dangerous, long lasting effects and it is ridiculous to give them to adolescents to control their periods.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
