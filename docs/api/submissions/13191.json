My neighbors have been living next door since 2012. Along with those neighbors, I also share a property line with another set of neighbors whose backyard meets with my backyard. We ended up having a disagreement with backyard neighbor over who was responsible for some trees close to the property line, so I had a property survey done because neither of us had one. \n\nSo the survey was completed, backyard neighbor still hates me 3 years later, but that\u2019s not where my inquiry stems from. \n\nThe survey revealed that the OTHER neighbors, with whom we share a side yard line, planted landscaping and built a fence about 6 feet into my yard. I suspected this was the case when they did it, but I didn\u2019t want to confront them because I didn\u2019t have a survey to prove anything. After the survey, I did inform them that their fence and landscaping were on my side. They weren\u2019t happy and insisted that my survey was wrong and that the multiple people who lived here before me always used an old hedgerow (that was long gone when I came) as the divider. I told them I don\u2019t know anything about that, but the results of my legal property survey are right here. They became confrontational and told me they were going to call their lawyer, and I hadn\u2019t even made any kind of request at that point. \n\nFast forward about a month, they asked if they could buy the sliver of property that their fence was built on. Within this time, I found out that they had actually had their own property survey done a year after they moved in. This irritated me because they knew all along where the line was (legally), but they decided to build over it anyway based on what someone had apparently told them about some hedgerow, so I said I didn\u2019t want to sell any of the property, partially because of that and partially because the fence they built is only about 3 feet from my shed, which is too close based on zoning laws where I live. I was also upset that instead of making this request from the start, they threatened me with calling their lawyer. \n\nThey\u2019re middle-aged people, and I bought my house when I was 21, so to me, it feels like they thought they could take advantage of a younger couple and do whatever they wanted. \n\nThey did move the landscaping, but the fence still stands where is has been. I had suggested drawing up an agreement that allows them to use the property for the fence, but if they ever move, I\u2019d like the fence taken down to prevent problems with future owners. They didn\u2019t like that and told me in a fit that they\u2019d just move the fence back onto their own property. Now they\u2019ve been avoiding talking to me about it for 3 years. But I guess it\u2019s whatever. I\u2019m not a confrontational person. \n\nIt does bother me because I know they\u2019ve been talking to other neighbors and people in town and telling them my husband and I are assholes for not just selling them the property and expecting them to move their fence, even though I\u2019ve never actually said that.

Depending on the laws in your area, they might have to take the dance down, or they might not. But you do need to clear this up.\n\nAnd there might be other ramifications from having their fence on your land. But if you are in the US, property laws vary so much that you really should meet with a knowledgeable lawyer. It might only take one or two sessions with the lawyer to get everything sorted out.", "NTA.  It's your property.  They had a survey done and then disregarded the survey.  That's on them.  Frankly, I think you're nice for not having an attorney tell them they need to move the fence because of the code violation.", "You can always build another fence, legally on your side of the property line, putting their fence in your side.  \ud83d\ude0f.

In the event of let\u2019s say getting packages, or maybe watching your place while your gone like collecting mail, spotting weird people around your house, etc. But now, because of a strip of land, you won\u2019t have that.

They\u2019re the kind of people who act nice to your face, so it\u2019s been hard for me to separate that with everything else.

For my piece of mind , I'd check with a lawyer to see if legally I could just remove the fence.\n\nThey're hoping you just give up.

Time gives them clout. They're hoping you let them do nothing til time ticks by and they can simply claim it. 3 years is enough notice.

They\u2019ve already knowingly taken advantage of you, and continue to do so.", "Get the jump on them and talk to a lawyer. Since the fence is on your property, it's within your rights to move it if they won't.

I read an article about a guy from Delaware that had a vacation home there. He didn't visit it very often. He noticed on one of the trips that the neighbors had built a enclosure on their property for animals that took up a good chunk of the yard. He went to court and and lost and had to sign the entire property over to the neighbors because they had the enclosure on his property for so long without him saying anything that the courts said the neighbor had a right to the land. Guy lost a 100,000 dollar property because he fucked around and let it go on for to long.", "You think they're trying to take advantage of you, but you're also letting them", "No I'd put my new fence ON the property line and then remove their fence and deposit it onto their property.  Because their plan Is so clearly to take that land away from you. There is no other reason to drag this out. They are counting on your ignorance of the law and youth to get away with it. Shame on them. And I didn't name call you. We ALL learn different things st different times in our lives because of experience varying. And now I'm overexplaining. Thanks anxiety! \ud83d\ude0a  I had people try to do this to me and my husband a few years back and while the survey was being g read a neighbor beside us realized the guy had stolen almost 3 feet of his land too! \ud83d\ude33 good luck op. But defend yourself as diligently as we internet strangers want to defend you! Nobody deserves to be cheated for not knowing the law.", "Thank you. I really appreciate the input. Obviously I\u2019ve talked to my friends and family about it, and they all said the same things you did, but I really wanted to get this out of my head and get perspective from people who don\u2019t feel obligated to take my side. I have moderate anxiety, so I\u2019m really just trying to live my life and piss off as few people as possible along the way. \ud83d\ude05 Now to decide whether it\u2019s going to be myself or my husband to take the fall.

Why should you have to do or sell anything, it is your legal property.", "The fence is on your property you can take it down.", "If everyone was already using the hedgerow, it could give them the right to possess up to the hedgerow. Yes, even though the survey shows different. Possession isn't based on surveys, it's literally a physical possession. I would talk to a lawyer about what you should do. It might end up better for you to sell it to them to make some money off of it, rather than them just having a right to possess without having to pay you anything. NTA for not wanting to sell, but this isn't the kind of thing you know you're right, without talking to a lawyer. You could be completely wrong and not know it.", "I think thats what title insurance is for?", "NTA I would have asked them to move the fence and once they threatened lawyers I would have put a deadline on when they needed the fence moved. If it wasn't I would have ripped it up myself. \nYou are a lovely neighbor and they should be grateful to have you.", "You need to quit being nice. Either have them move the fence now \u2014 you're going to need a lawyer \u2014 or they'll likely get that sliver of land through adverse possession. NTA.", "Nta. Never sell your land. And you know they might reported you for your shed being to close the the fence.  They should have been honest.", "Nta Stop being a doormat. Why are you worried about upsetting bad people? They intentionally were malicious. Might as well walk in your house and wear your clothes or use your dishes it's your property and you paid for it."]}
