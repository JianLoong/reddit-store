I could never enjoy myself because they would always be with there partner's on that trip and doing couple things 3rd wheel is the worst thing ever. Just go but get separate accommodation and just have a solo trip that place is beautiful and massive plenty of things to do by yourself", "NTA. You signed up for a girls' trip, not to be a 5th wheel when you aren't even very fond of everyone in the group. Traveling is very much impacted by who you go with, and Hawaii isn't one to waste on people you don't vibe with! \n\nOn that note, I agree with all the people saying \"don't waste the ticket!\" Go. Go to the beach, on hikes, see waterfalls, eat some delicious food. Get shaved ice! Do all the fun things yourself and let them have a couples trip.

You are kind enough to understand that taking such a long trip together is nice for bride and groom even though the impact of that on you is not what you want.
