One of my girlfriends (Sarah) is going to get married this year, so we thought its gon be a nice and cute girls trip only three of us (another one is Tammy) \n\nThey mean a lot to me and we have been besties since we were kids in primary schools, and now we\u2019re already 24 hehe. so we planned this trip because Sarah is going to get married by the end of this year *and its unlikely for her to travel alone after getting married because a culture thing* \n\nwe have been planning for this Hawaii trip for months, and suddenly this morning, they told me in group chat that her fianc\u00e9 and Tammy\u2019s boyfriend are going to come along. \n\nHere before, we have traveled for short trips before, and honestly I don\u2019t really vibe with her fianc\u00e9, not because he is mean or abusive, but it\u2019s just I could never be myself when we\u2019re hanging out if there\u2019s her fianc\u00e9.

So this is possibly like their honeymoon/prewed photoshoot trip too. \n\nBut they think I\u2019m selfish for not tagging along and they really want me to come because the girls trip will still be girls trip as long as three of us are there. \n\nI explained to them abt how it is actually not cool to change plans but I completely understand because she really wanna go there with her man because its a long travel trip too so she doesnt wanna waste it only for girls trip. \n\nBut i think my feelings are valid too, apart from the fact I don\u2019t really like her fianc\u00e9, it is just not right to change the plans, but guilt trip me and expected me to give in and adjust to the plans. \n\nI have tried to explain nicely, but Sarah said something like\n \u201cYou don\u2019t understand how hard it is for us to be the middle person\u201d\n\nFrom the texts, i think they expected me to just go along with the trip and say nothing\u2026 but honestly i dont want it, i really WOULD LOVE TO go back there travel especially with my girls.. *but you can\u2019t tell me the vibes and DYNAMICS would still be the same with their partners coming along\u2026*", "created_utc": 1676031790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yqnoa/aita_for_not_goin_to_girls_trip_bc_their_partners/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't have to spend time with them. Go and enjoy yourself and have a self care vacation. Don't waste 1000 dollars because of them. You deserve that", "NTA - this is not what you signed up for.... but perhaps not let an expensive ticket go to waste and book yourself a different hotel, have some vacation and agree on meeting them there once or twice for girls only activities", "NTA. You signed up for a certain type of trip and they changed it without asking you. The fact that one of them doesn't want to \"waste it only for girls trip\" is really insulting. I wonder if it's possible for you to still use the nonrefundable ticket to that destination but book different accommodations?", "NTA, not a girl trip if the fiance tags along to keep check. Same as it wouldn't be for a boys trip.", "NTA, the post is a little bit chaotic so I didn't understand everything but it was supposed to be a girls' trip and by taking their partners there, they made it not a girls' trip anymore. If I were you, I would still go but just by yourself as a solo trip for you. If they don't understand how taking their partners along while you will be there alone affects the dynamic of the trip, then I'm sorry for that and hope they realise this.", "A girls trip for three girls *and two of their male partners* is *not* a \u201cgirls trip\u201d anymore, it is a \u201ccouples trip\u201d. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to go *if you don\u2019t want to*. It would be substantially different from what you initially agreed to, and anyone arguing otherwise is in denial or just wants you to suck it up and go. \n\nI hope you haven\u2019t paid any money into this yet.

This isn\u2019t a \u2018girls\u2019 trip\u2019 anymore, it\u2019s a couples\u2019 trip with an uncomfortable 5th wheel who doesn\u2019t want to go. Don\u2019t go if you don\u2019t want to go, and don\u2019t let anybody try to convince you that you would be the one hurting the friendship by declining to attend.

If this was supposed to be a girls trip then they shouldn\u2019t have invited their partners of course it will change the dynamic i\u2019d be pissed if my friends did that to me. It\u2019s not a girls trip anymore they\u2019ve changed it to a couples trip without asking you. I don\u2019t really understand that how hard it is to be the middle person comment from Sarah.", "NTA - You do not need their approval to pass on this trip. They certainly did not seek your approval in inviting their partners. I would absolutely not go on this trip with them. I would, however, try to see if the dates could be changed, then see if you could find a friend who wants to go with you. It doesn't have to be the end of the friendship, but they ended the \"girl's trip\" plans. That is 100% on them. Do what makes you most comfortable in response.", "NTA. It ain't a girls trip if the boys are there. Yes your feelings are valid, a lot. And maybe they are trying to guilt trip you to forget their own guilt of changing plans the last minute.\n\nINFO: Can't you change the date or something so you don't loose the ticket?\n\nI hope you find a way to solve this with your friends.  Just keep in mind that solving things is a two way road. There's not much you can do if your friends don't take responsability for what they did.", "NTA it\u2019s weird of them to say that you\u2019re selfish. they changed the plans and expect you to accommodate? it\u2019s not a girls trip, you\u2019d be a third wheel next to 2 couples. \ni\u2019d say that you should go but not with them, maybe you can find another hotel and make this vacation about you. treat yourself!", "NTA at all op and they sound like they don\u2019t care about ur feelings", "NTA\n\nIt's no longer a girl's trip. It's a group trip. What they are doing is more like you saying, \"Hey girls, my brother always wanted to go there, so I'm bringing him along.\" Adding boys into a girls' trip completely changes the group dynamic. You not traveling is your prerogative when the trip has been so drastically changed.\n\nEdit: sometimes the airline will convert your ticket to a travel voucher good for 1 year.

Your friends though\u2026 whilst it is not a AH move to want their partners, it was an AH move to just do it without talking to you. If it was me and my single friend was thinking we were doing the last big hurrah trip as girls and I wanted to bring my partner as did the other girls, I would have the common decency to speak to her and get her feelings and let her know she has a voice and a chance to say no. In that your friends as massive AH. They made a decision and you are expected to tag along all because they wanted it, and have the audacity to gaslight you into you don\u2019t understand. Sorry but your pals are AHs and even more so because they are still trying to pretend they are not.\n\nTotally NTA for you. Think you need to start to explore other friendships because they are clearly not in the same place you are.

Then i would do a solo vacation before or after them.", "NTA - Personally my rule is, if I sign up for a girl trip that is what I am doing. If ANYONE brings their man I am not going. People need to remember their SO is THEIR favourite person and not mine. I am not spending my money to spend time with someone I don't care about, and neither should you. Shaming you, is stupid. \nThey ruined the vibe and are now mad at your for it. Foolishness.", "NTA, it isn\u2019t a Girls Trip if significant others are tagging along, it\u2019s a couples trip with a 5th wheel.\n\nTelling the group that suddenly their partners are coming, without discussing it first is radically changing the dynamics of the trip and frankly I wouldn\u2019t go either.

You can like their partners and not want to be treated like a spare, they are not mutually exclusive.  Ultimately all that matters is you do what is best for you. If you want to take the holiday but stay somewhere else that is awesome too. Don\u2019t let this be a waste of money and go enjoy some quiet time. If I am honest I prefer travelling solo as I don\u2019t have to worry about anyone else\u2019s problems or thoughts \ud83d\ude02. Do what is best for you and ignore anything else.

Go on by yourself and obviously stay at a different hotel to avoid awkward encounters. \n\nThere is another option: Is there another friend you can also invite? You can tell them that since they changed the original plans for the trip and you don\u2019t really want to be the fifth wheel in a couples vacation you\u2019re bringing a friend to hang out with you while they are with their partners. They can\u2019t say anything to that because they\u2019re the ones to change the plans originally. Either way you\u2019re absolutely NTA and your feelings are very valid.
