I could never enjoy myself because they would always be with there partner's on that trip and doing couple things 3rd wheel is the worst thing ever. Just go but get separate accommodation and just have a solo trip that place is beautiful and massive plenty of things to do by yourself", "NTA. You signed up for a girls' trip, not to be a 5th wheel when you aren't even very fond of everyone in the group. Traveling is very much impacted by who you go with, and Hawaii isn't one to waste on people you don't vibe with! \n\nOn that note, I agree with all the people saying \"don't waste the ticket!\" Go. Go to the beach, on hikes, see waterfalls, eat some delicious food. Get shaved ice! Do all the fun things yourself and let them have a couples trip. Maybe just the girls can meet you one night for dinner or something, but just go for yourself and so you don't waste $1000", "INFO:\n\n> but it\u2019s just I could never be myself when we\u2019re hanging out if there\u2019s her fianc\u00e9. \n\nWhy not?

I\u2019d confirm with the airlines, but if not, go, stay elsewhere and enjoy.  Take some amazing hikes, get a massage, go on a sunset cruise, the whole shebang.", "Tammy\u2019s boyfriend was added to make his presence less awkward.", "I had an old friend from school say that when we were planning a reunion weekend with our group. We weren't worth the plane ticket just us apparently, so I decided we weren't worth remaining friends", "Call the airline. We have often found changes are possible even on cheap tickets", "omg this is hilarious hahaha\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "oop sorry for having bad english grammar, dont need to be too pressed on it bruh NOT everyone has ENGLISH as their first language like you do :)", "OP says she is studying abroad. She may not have been educated in English.", "to clarify Cent1234 who has very good english hehe, \n\nI would be acting like not myself when im hangout if her fianc\u00e9 is in the same room because :\n1) i dont vibe with her fianc\u00e9, but trying to be respectful bc he\u2019s my best friend husband to be.\n2) her fiance sometimes would look judgy when he\u2019s hanging out w us, because he\u2019s 4 years older than us.\n\nI hope those two hotpoints clarify ur INFO xx", "Or you may be able to transfer it to one of the partners that are tagging along and they can pay you back...", "you sound Irish love this!", "I'd tell them \"Why? Cuz i don't wanna spend time listening to your moans next door.\"", "Call the airline. Often you can take a credit and pay a small fee to rebook at a later date", "Can you change it to a different time? Maybe you don't even have to see them at all", "Your friends are trifling. Girls trips are sacred. Inviting partners is a huge violation. You should still go and live your best life, solo! You deserve the vacation!", "They know what they are doing isn\u2019t right but in some way think if they can bully you into accepting this new plan it\u2019ll be ok that they switched without even asking you. Newsflash: it\u2019s not ok to do that. But I think you should use that ticket and have fun either by yourself or with a new friend you invite for a real girl\u2019s getaway.", "Bold of you to assume that English is my first language.", "This is a restatement of what you've already said; 'I don't want to hang out because I don't want to hang out.'\n\n'I don't vibe' doesn't mean anything.  'Sometimes would look judgy' doesn't mean anything.\n\nWhat are the actual issues beyond 'I don't like him?'  What would you do differently with him not there?", "Hahah because someone was being cocky abt it hehe\ud83e\udd13", "Was her fiance jealous of the fact that he wasn't initially invited/included?\n\nIf my husband started actually guilt-tripping me to be included in a girl's trip, I'd think he doesn't trust me.", "But you are seeing it from their point of view, that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t ask them to leave the men at home.", "Go. Your NTA most assuredly but don't throw away a planned trip to Hawaii! Stay elsewhere. You wanted a vacation with the girls. The girls changed your plans so you changed yours to accommodate a couples weekend of their choosing.", "Go. Your NTA most assuredly but don't throw away a planned trip to Hawaii! Stay elsewhere.

NTA!", "Or is the fianc\u00e9 pushing her to come? You state that she's likely not going to be allowed to travel without him once they are married for cultural reasons (which tbh sounds a bit scary and controlling). Is it possible that is the same reasons why he's not keen on letting her travel alone now?", "> she doesnt wanna waste it only for girls trip.\n\n\"*Waste*\"?!\n\nFuck that, NTA.", "NTA\n\nDo you know who\u2019s idea/decision it was to bring the boys along? Was it your girlfriends idea or their boyfriend\u2019s idea? And what\u2019s up with the no solo trip after marriage?\n\nJust asking because once I went on a girl\u2019s trip and my EX huffed and pouted about wanting to go, saying he was going to get tickets but he wasn\u2019t going to hang out with us, then did a lot of guilting that if I really loved him I would never leave him like that.", "NTA. I completely understand how you feel. I\u2019ve been the single friend in a best friend trio for years. I can\u2019t imagine a situation as extreme as this when I get annoyed with my friends bringing their significant others simply to dinner or something without making it clear beforehand. I\u2019m so sorry they sprung this on you OP.", "NTA. You don\u2019t understand? OP, someone here lacks understanding. It\u2019s not you.", "NTA.\n\nThis is not what you wanted, and more importantly not what you *expected* and all *planned*.\n\nI would have skipped the \"long essay\" though.... I would have just told them that this wasn't what you signed up for and you'll just sit this one out.  Bon voyage!", "NTA. You're right, the vibes and dynamics are going to be completely different. You will have to accommodate to the wishes of more people, which is hard, especially when you haven't build some routine with them before.", "NTA.\n\nI actually think you're less upset than I would be. Without considering your feelings in the slightest, thy dramatically altered the trip you've been planning and have already invested money toward. The fact that you no longer really want to go sucks. You shouldn't be made to feel like the bad guy here, and in fact, I feel like they both owe you for wasting $1000.", "NTA, non-refundable tickets don\u2019t always mean non-changeable.  See if you can go at a later time by yourself or with another friend.", "NTA\n\nThey should pay for your unused ticket as they changed the nature of the trip without consulting you. So unfair.", "NTA \n\n\nAnd the fact that Tammy and Sarah agreed to this before coming to you means they know it. It wasn't one of them texting both of you and saying \"Hey, would you guys mind if my partner tagged along?\" \n\n\nAlso, even if the airline won't refund you, they might be willing to give credit. Call as soon as you can. Did you book it?", "NTa. It\u2019s not a girls trip and you\u2019d constantly be left out or the tag along.", "I saw in one of your comments that your ticket is no refundable and cannot be rescheduled. I\u2019m surprised your ticket can\u2019t be rescheduled with a fee.  However, assuming I\u2019m wrong, I think you should use the ticket without telling your friends (to avoid the guilt trips) and have a lovely vacation on your own.  NTA.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not a girls trip if your friends' SOs tags a long.\n\nIt's not OK for them to just tell you that they are coming along, no questions asked.\n\nThey should have talked to you beforehand when they knew they wanted to bring their partners.\n\nI would opt out from the trip in your situation too. Or better, use the tickets and do the trip alone!", "Nta, a girls trip has the implied part of only being the friends no so", "NTA Is your ticket *changeable*? If not, go and do something you want to do and maybe stay at a different hotel, see if another friend is interested, that kind of thing.", "NTA. Why would you want to go on a couples trip m and basically be the third wheel.", "NTA, your friends are being mean to you.", "Nta", "NTA", "Nta. They changed the trip without consulting the group, that's pretty rude. But since your flight is already paid for you could just go on your own and have an awesome time doing exactly what you want and when. That's what I would do.", "Definitely NTA. They are a couple of them though. They're being self centered and inconsiderate and ridiculous. That's all I have to say about that. You didn't sign up for a couples trip and yes, there is a HUGE difference between a girl's trip and.. that. The audacity of them, TBH. I hope you can maybe find a way to transfer your ticket to something else for yourself! :)  I saw someone else mention going and doing your own thing, that's an option too. I love my solo trips, even though I also love traveling with my S.O., family and friends. Something different about doing your own thing on your own schedule!", "Do you have any other (single) friends who like to travel?  Maybe you could invite someone else for you to spend time with so your ticket isn\u2019t wasted. I\u2019d also have no interest in traveling with two couples - especially not almost newlyweds who are clearly going to be focused on each other and not on including you.", "I am mad for you OP, NTA.\n\nThey are the ones being selfish by letting their wants and needs take over a vacation that was planned for all of you. They changed the plans; they deal with the fall out. They need to make peace with the fact that they are getting married/ have partners and things unfortunately won't be the same anymore. They can't be. There is no \"Middle Person\", they are making a choice to \"forsake all others\" as they should for their relationships. Once again, their choice. \n\nDon't waste your money, see if you can change the dates and find another friend to go at a later date. If they get nitpicky about it and call you selfish again. Let them know that you stopped caring what they thought about this trip and their feelings connected to it the minute they informed you (not asked you) that their partners were coming, because that was the moment, they stopped caring about your feelings regarding the trip. As others have said worse come to worse don't waste your money because they lack the common courtesy to respect the intention of the trip. Better yet, let them know you are going, but book your own activities and hotel away from them. Maybe then they will know how it feels to be told something after decision are made.  Don't tell them that part until you land unless there's money involved in sharing a room, but that's an easy fix, let them know you WILL NOT be staying in a room with them and two men you are not involved with/ related to.", "NTA. And I think it\u2019s kind of sad especially with context that they couldn\u2019t see where you were coming from.\n\nThis has always been your girls trip, and your friend is about to be married with future solo travel restrictions. \n\nIt makes me sad for you. They\u2019re all about their love lives right now and just decided that you should be fine third wheeling because of it and that you\u2019re *selfish* for not wanting to do that.\n\nThat\u2019s not very friendly of them :(\n\nIt would definitely hurt my feelings if you need some validation there.", "NTA.  Being the 5th wheel is tolerable for a dinner or something like that which is just one evening.  But a long trip?  I would be miserable in that situation.  I wouldn't go either.", "My take away in AITA vacation rants, one must now spell out the rules (the organizer) in black and white before anybody commits. IOW planner to individuals, \"This is strictly a GF trip of three, nobody else including \"mates\".\n\nRegardless OP you're NTA, but your GF's are.  Pretty selfish group there.", "NTA, non-refundable tickets don\u2019t always mean non-changeable. See if you can go at a later time by yourself or with another friend.", "> NTA it\u2019s weird of them to say that you\u2019re selfish. \n\nWhen some people get mad, they just reach into a bag of vaguely-unpleasant words and just start flinging, it's honestly hilarious.\n\n> \"Ma'am, I'm so sorry, this coupon is expired.\"\n> \n> \"WELL YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS!\"", "It\u2019s mainly my girls\u2019 ideas and the bois wanna tag a long too.. \n\nWe\u2019ve talked abt this and the reason her fianc\u00e9 tagged along is bc the ticket is cheap bc there\u2019s some promos going on.. and they wanna save up for a bit too so high probability going to do their pre wedding photoshoot there too", "Aww im sorry you had to go through that! I dont really mind if its only dinner or short trips but since this is going to be a 12 days trip so\u2026\ud83e\udd72", "Yes and 1,000 is a LOT for a ticket so if they do allow exchanges, op can surely find somewhere else that's just as fun if not more fun.", "They don't care about how they treated you and ignored your protests. Stop living your life trying not to offend others. Take that trip yourself and have fun. If they bitch, tell them to kick rocks since they changed plans first.", "I've traveled alone most of the time. I really think you should do it as well. You would only see them in the airport/plane and you can probably still pick any seat.", "Who cares. They fucked you over not the other way around.", "The real question is why aren\u2019t YOU mad???", "Just go on the trip. Go down there and go on your own. Meet them for dinner a few times. You know once you get there, they're going to go off on their own. Or transfer the ticket for later. Don't screw yourself out of $1K because your friends are inconsiderate.", "It seems to me that they are used to manipulating you, and you are used to going along with it.", "That\u2019s their excuse so that they don\u2019t feel like they ostracized you. They already left you out by making you a 5th wheel. Nta", "They \u2018left\u2019 you out when they made the decision to invite two more people wo input.  I would put foot down. I am NOT going.  Do not bring it up again", "Who cares if they're pissed? Go and do your own thing don't lose 1K to be a people pleaser. That's part of the problem.  Stop it!", "Not to be rude...\nBut if you want to go, get a backbone\n\nThey didn't care about asking you, why are you not going to appease them?", "Do you have a friend at school who would want to go? They\u2019re being partners so bring a person for you. Doesn\u2019t have to be a romantic partner - just a trip partner. Could be a great opportunity to turn a close friend into a for-life friend. And then you won\u2019t be a 5th wheel because you\u2019ll still have someone to do stuff with if they\u2019re doing couple-ly things.", "Even though you do have a issue with one of the partners, you have a little wiggle room here to clarify that your decision is not about the people it is about their actions.\n\nThey've also possibly put more of a financial burden on you with their actions.  Unless you three ladies were planning to each get your own rooms when it was a girls trip, you are now going to have to get your own room while they will be splitting their rooms between two people.  \n\nThem claiming that it isn't fair to make them choose ignores the fact that they already chose.  They chose their partners over you and expected you to just suck it up, which is sucky action on their part too.\n\nDon't cut off your nose to spite your face though.  Unless there is a date by which you have to cancel/change your flights to get part of the money back, don't cancel right away.  If the airline has to adjust your flights due to their own scheduling issues, and the adjustment is more than a few hours, you have leverage where they may have to refund you even on an non-refundable ticket.", "\"gave them the feeling I don't like their partners\"\n\nWell they are the ones giving the feeling that they don't like you lol \n\nHow sad that they can't enjoy a trip without their SOs tagging along", "You are completely valid in your feelings, that\u2019s a long trip. And your friends describing themselves as the middle person is odd when their SO\u2019s weren\u2019t involved with the plans to begin with. I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty or let them make you feel bad - plans should be discussed and approved by everyone before making big changes like that!", "Not vibing does in fact have meaning. You just don\u2019t pass the vibe check", "She isn\u2019t torn. Her fianc\u00e9 will survive not going on a girls trip. She\u2019s not in the middle- she\u2019s trying to force you to be.

Are they planning to take the beds and have you sleep on the floor?\n\nI\u2019ve been married for 16 years and still go on girls trips with my friends.
