I could never enjoy myself because they would always be with there partner's on that trip and doing couple things 3rd wheel is the worst thing ever. Just go but get separate accommodation and just have a solo trip that place is beautiful and massive plenty of things to do by yourself", "NTA. You signed up for a girls' trip, not to be a 5th wheel when you aren't even very fond of everyone in the group. Traveling is very much impacted by who you go with, and Hawaii isn't one to waste on people you don't vibe with! \n\nOn that note, I agree with all the people saying \"don't waste the ticket!\" Go. Go to the beach, on hikes, see waterfalls, eat some delicious food. Get shaved ice! Do all the fun things yourself and let them have a couples trip. Maybe just the girls can meet you one night for dinner or something, but just go for yourself and so you don't waste $1000", "INFO:\n\n> but it\u2019s just I could never be myself when we\u2019re hanging out if there\u2019s her fianc\u00e9. \n\nWhy not?  What would you be doing differently if the fianc\u00e9 was present?\n\nAlso, you're 24 years old; please learn how to write English correctly.", "I agree, i'd be a bit snide and go \"look im going but lets be honest, you gys are gonna be doing the mush lovey dovey ooh ahh stuff, so I'll just see you around ok?\"", "It\u2019s possible the ticket can be exchanged for a different ticket in the future.  I\u2019d confirm with the airlines, but if not, go, stay elsewhere and enjoy.  Take some amazing hikes, get a massage, go on a sunset cruise, the whole shebang.", "Tammy\u2019s boyfriend was added to make his presence less awkward.", "I had an old friend from school say that when we were planning a reunion weekend with our group. We weren't worth the plane ticket just us apparently, so I decided we weren't worth remaining friends", "Call the airline. We have often found changes are possible even on cheap tickets", "omg this is hilarious hahaha\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "oop sorry for having bad english grammar, dont need to be too pressed on it bruh NOT everyone has ENGLISH as their first language like you do :)", "OP says she is studying abroad. She may not have been educated in English.", "to clarify Cent1234 who has very good english hehe, \n\nI would be acting like not myself when im hangout if her fianc\u00e9 is in the same room because :\n1) i dont vibe with her fianc\u00e9, but trying to be respectful bc he\u2019s my best friend husband to be.\n2) her fiance sometimes would look judgy when he\u2019s hanging out w us, because he\u2019s 4 years older than us.\n\nI hope those two hotpoints clarify ur INFO xx", "Or you may be able to transfer it to one of the partners that are tagging along and they can pay you back...", "you sound Irish love this!", "I'd tell them \"Why? Cuz i don't wanna spend time listening to your moans next door.\"", "Call the airline. Often you can take a credit and pay a small fee to rebook at a later date", "Can you change it to a different time? Maybe you don't even have to see them at all", "Your friends are trifling. Girls trips are sacred. Inviting partners is a huge violation. You should still go and live your best life, solo! You deserve the vacation!", "They know what they are doing isn\u2019t right but in some way think if they can bully you into accepting this new plan it\u2019ll be ok that they switched without even asking you. Newsflash: it\u2019s not ok to do that. But I think you should use that ticket and have fun either by yourself or with a new friend you invite for a real girl\u2019s getaway.", "Bold of you to assume that English is my first language.", "This is a restatement of what you've already said; 'I don't want to hang out because I don't want to hang out.'\n\n'I don't vibe' doesn't mean anything.  'Sometimes would look judgy' doesn't mean anything.\n\nWhat are the actual issues beyond 'I don't like him?'  What would you do differently with him not there?", "Hahah because someone was being cocky abt it hehe\ud83e\udd13", "Was her fiance jealous of the fact that he wasn't initially invited/included?\n\nIf my husband started actually guilt-tripping me to be included in a girl's trip, I'd think he doesn't trust me.", "But you are seeing it from their point of view, that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t ask them to leave the men at home.", "Go. Your NTA most assuredly but don't throw away a planned trip to Hawaii! Stay elsewhere. You wanted a vacation with the girls. The girls changed your plans so you changed yours to accommodate a couples weekend of their choosing.", "Go. Your NTA most assuredly but don't throw away a planned trip to Hawaii! Stay elsewhere. You wanted a vacation with the girls. The girls changed your plans so you changed yours to accommodate a couples weekend of their choosing.", "If you aren't flying together, there is no need to even tell them you're still going but staying somewhere else. NTA!", "Or is the fianc\u00e9 pushing her to come? You state that she's likely not going to be allowed to travel without him once they are married for cultural reasons (which tbh sounds a bit scary and controlling). Is it possible that is the same reasons why he's not keen on letting her travel alone now?"]}
