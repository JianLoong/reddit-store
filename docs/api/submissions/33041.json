This is when I knew he had taken my car to go deliver food, bear in mind my car insurance is not business and is not insured to deliver food either. My dad took my car because he would have had to empty his van which would have made the delivery 5-10 mins late, my mums car keys where locked inside of her car and the family car had a flat battery.

My dad doesn\u2019t take this seriously and says I am over reacting to nothing but mentioned how he knew I would have said no if he called me before hand. He says I am blowing things out of proportion when nothing happened to my car but when I try to tell him what could of happened and why taking it is wrong he just says he apologized and that\u2019s enough and he won\u2019t touch my car again.

You are right that your insurance wouldn't cover a work-related accident for the food delivery business.  \n\nTake your father off your insurance (if you can, you may not be able to if you all live together) and take all the extra sets of keys because your parents can't be trusted.", "NTA and it\u2019s time to take your dad off the insurance and keep the key with you at all times.

He did apologize and say he wouldn\u2019t take your car again.  In the long run, if he keeps his word, you will be getting what you want.  What was done, is done.

You can only deal with what does happen.

You\u2019re in a tough spot still living at home but get those keys back. Get yourself on video telling both of them that they are not allowed to use your car for anything other than personal emergencies if they won\u2019t return your keys. If something happens you will need to burn all the bridges and report it as stolen.", "Give them the heads up the next time your car gets used without permission it's being reported stolen.
