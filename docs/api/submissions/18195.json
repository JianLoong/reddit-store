I'm a lady who chose to not have kids for many reasons, one of which is that I loathe babies.  There is absolutely nothing about them that I like.  I read that part about her watching baby videos and said \"eww\" out loud.  You're free to have the same opinion, or any other about them. \n\nBut are you sure you and your gf are compatible?  Really, really sure?  She loves babies and kids, and you don't, except to say that you may have them in the future.  Are you saying that because YOU want them or because your gf wants them so much?  Please do not create a new person if you aren't sure that you really, really want that person.  Trust me, even toddlers know when a parent isn't into them, and it's a great way to mess them up. \n\nPlease consider if your and your gf's goals for the future are the same.  You can absolutely love her and still be incompatible.  And if you stay together, this hates-kids-loves-kids thing will become a THING and a breaking point sooner or later, it's one of the few things for which there's no compromise.  One of the few things one must have in common with a longtime partner.  So do some very honest soul searching, okay?", "NAH.  Every argument/conflict does not have someone being an asshole.  And neither of you are assholes.\n\nThat said - you both sound like you are heading towards incompatibility.  Better to address that now, then waiting until 30.  Or even worse, until there is an \"oops\" (intentional or unintentional) and she's pregnant.", "NTA:  Doesn't sound like you two are compatible.  She's angling for you to change all your plans and have a kid asap.  No one who plans to wait years is spending hours watching baby videos.  She's hoping you'll catch the bug too.", "NTA.\n\nPlease leave your girlfriend dude. Whatever you think you want, you clearly don't want kids. People who want kids eventually do not act this way. And your girlfriend def wants kids, maybe on a timeline much sooner than she says. \n\nYou two are not compatible.", "NAH. Sounds like you two are going in different directions in life. Neither is wrong, but it is a factor in the relationship. Clearly she wants you to start showing an interest in these things, and is concerned you are not. Relationships frequently mean compromise, and doing something your partner wants to make them happy. Not doing so doesn't mean your an AH. But it  also is not a great sign for the future of the relationship.", "YTA a bit because you say you want them in the future (at 30) but won\u2019t go near them now (25). Your gf is probably concerned you will get to 30 one day and say you\u2019re not ready. And also you will not be ready if you decide to wing it and learn everything about being a father and being around children for the first time with your own child. \n\nIt sounds like you don\u2019t want kids period. Are you expecting to wake up on your 30th bday and suddenly go \u201cI suddenly want a baby!\u201d  I think your gf can see this flaw in your logic and is concerned that your stubbornness to assert your position only shows your true feelings. \n\nRelationships take compromise and no one is saying having a baby now or ever especially if you don\u2019t want one and are not ready.  However, you should demonstrate to your partner that you are willing SOME day to be a parent and a good one at that, and recoiling at the presence of any child just simply won\u2019t demonstrate that. \n\nHave a good think about what you want and best of luck!", "NAH but you don't seem compatible. She's trying to see what life with kids with you would be like and you're not showing her a great picture. I'd be turned off too, but I don't know why neither one of you has broken it off yet. Doesn't seem like it's going to work.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m gonna be honest with you OP. You two do not appear to be compatible", "You guys sound like a toxic couple.  In your brief story you have hinted at several key issues in your relationship.", "NAH but why don\u2019t you just admit to yourself that you don\u2019t actually want kids? No one who wants to be a parent hates children this much. \n\nBe real with yourself. This is ridiculous.", "NAH but seriously, if it will kill you to go meet a new person that is apart of your GF's life you should reconsider having children. If you avoid children like the plague and get frustrated by your GF's hopes and dreams of a family one day, you two are incompatible. And you are talking about which sports you will sign your kids up for? FYI not all kids are into sports. Will you be disappointed if your children don't enjoy the same sports you do? You should evaluate WHY you want children. So far, it sounds like either selfish reasons or because that's just what a guy does in his 30s.", "I can see how you'd be \"spooked\" by your gf watching baby videos and stuff because you said you don't want them at all right now, but tbh I think you should be happy she loves baby's so much because if you REALLY do want kids like you say you do, she sounds like she would be a very active and loving mother. If you say you both are on the same page about waiting to have a family, I don't see what the big deal is about going to see a baby or a toddler with her? She just wants to do something she enjoys with you. Who knows, you might fall in love with her even more after seeing how great she is with kids. Or, you might realize you dislike kids and don't want them at all. Idk you kind of seem like the type of dad who would never get up in the middle of the night, change a single diaper or feed the baby(I could be wrong). You said yourself you're not very \"fatherly.\" I think you're kidding yourself when you say you want kids. You want to be in your late 50s picking your kids up from high school", "YTA for absurd use of the word \"boundary\".\n\nIt's fine not to want kids. From your post, it sounds like you don't actually like your gf much, so I'm not sure why you're a couple.\n\nI will note that there's a big difference between \"I'm not ready for kids now, because I have other things I want to do first\" and \"I don't want to touch a baby because I can't stand them\". I don't really see how you move from the latter position to \"we do want to have kids in the future\" if you can't bring yourself to interact with a baby now.", "NTA at all not everyone likes kids and that\u2019s okay but you and your girlfriend need to break up or have a serious conversation about the near future.\n\nIn my honest opinion 25 is too old to have no desire to move out and mature in life especially when you say you want a kid in the next 5 years and that does not mean starting a family. It just means that you aren\u2019t a teenager anymore and unless you have personal issues like healthy, family issues or financial issues beyond your control (choosing not to work doesn\u2019t count) then you should be looking to move out and prepare for having kids in the next 5 years which you said yourself you want to do. You also need to find yourself and get used to an environment without your immediate family in your life every day and start to mature as an adult. 5 years isn\u2019t a long time and you should have a stable income and home ready by then if you want kids then.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like other people\u2019s children then you\u2019re also not going to enjoy being a father. Being a parent means play dates, birthday parties, meeting other parents and their kids, baby sitting etc and it will badly affect your child and girlfriend trying to isolate from those duties. It\u2019s okay to choose to not have kids. You shouldn\u2019t have a kid just because you like the idea of having a family. \n\nYour girlfriend also isn\u2019t in the wrong at all. Women\u2019s fertility especially if they have issues with their periods (like undiagnosed or diagnosed endometriosis, pcos etc) can affect fertility after 25 so I completely understand why she wants kids and she\u2019s at a totally reasonable age to want to start a family.\n\nIt just sounds like you\u2019re totally incompatible and this should be discussed. Maybe she\u2019ll be willing to wait until you\u2019re both ready but neither of you should be sacrificing your own boundaries for each other.", "Well, it's fine not to want kids right now and you don't have to spend time with them. But I don't think you're going to suddenly change your mind about kids when you turn thirty. It's quite possible you'll still want to be child-free, which is fine, but your girlfriend will be upset about that. And there's also the possibility that she could get pregnant before thirty. If your girlfriend waits until after thirty to get pregnant, it could possibly take longer than it would now. And I think you're avoiding being around kids because you can sense that your girlfriend wants to have kids sooner rather than later.", "Your gf clearly wants a baby, probably sooner than later. You don\u2019t any time soon. It\u2019s obvious that you have hit a fork in the road, relationship-wise, and you each are walking down a different path. It may be kinder to let her go so she can find someone to build a family with on her timeline.", "You are not TA for not liking kids. Some do, some don\u2019t. She certainly has done nothing wrong. \n\nBut YWBTA if you do not let her find someone to share her life with that wants the same things as she does. A baby. A family. Soon. \n\nNot feeling ready for kids and wanting freedom in your 20s is absolutely not the same thing as actively disliking children. \n\nYou are not compatible. You think you\u2019ll want a family in your 30s the same way kids want a puppy. Until they actually have to take care of it. Constant attention. You\u2019re never alone. Can\u2019t pee in private. Have to shift your entire life around to make sure you\u2019re giving them the attention and exercise they need\u2026the analogy has gone on long enough. \n\nYou like the idea of a family in the future. I seriously doubt you\u2019ll actually want one. In the meanwhile you\u2019re stringing her along during the prime time to find someone truly compatible.", "Umm I don\u2019t think you should have any children at all in the future because if you feel that way now about even being around them I don\u2019t think you should even have a thought in mind about having any but you have your own thoughts and choices too make which I don\u2019t wrong you on it but I don\u2019t think this particular relationship is for you but that\u2019s My opinion, But if she\u2019s still the one for you buckle up with protection sir because sometimes the one\u2019s who don\u2019t want children pop up with the surprise of a lifetime with a child they weren\u2019t ready for or never wanted to have. Play it safe and good luck sir. NTA but save her and yourself from heartache you two are on different pages in life.", "YTA. This is such a red flag my dude I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s still with you. Kids don\u2019t magically become palatable when you reach an arbitrary age. They\u2019re messy and stinky and clingy and whiny and depend on you for their entire existence, and if you can\u2019t bear to be in the presence of a child now you aren\u2019t going to want to get up with one 6 times a night, and if you don\u2019t want to do that, don\u2019t get that girl pregnant ever. You\u2019re not TA for not wanting to be around kids, that\u2019s fully your choice, but YTA for pretending like you want to be in this relationship or have children because you like the idea of a family.", "YTA it doesnt sound like you do want kids and i think your gf is starting to realize that.", "NTA\n\nThe devil on my shoulder says you should tell her. \"You really want to expose me to young children after I tell you I'm not interested.

Just be realistic about the situation.", "YTA:  When someone tells you who they are... believe them.  This stupidity? Right here? That's how dumb guys get babytrapped.

But neither of us hated kids and anyone mentioning them for years? Dude, that's . . . why would anyone think you're going to magically start liking kids at 30? Or be a good father?\n\nIf you think of dating as sort of a trial period to see if you fit together, you'd fail that trial period and I'd move on. It's fine to be child free, but your girlfriend loves and wants children and you are sending all the red flags that you'll either never want kids or be resentful uninvolved dad. My childfree friends and brother don't act like you. Your whole active dislike of babies and children isn't really normal to me. Children are people so I also think I'd just mind beacuse disliking any group of people for being born seems uncool.", "I think the opposite is much more likely in this situation, that they\u2019ll get to 30 and OP will realise he doesn\u2019t actually want kids at all and gf will have wasted 10 years of her life with a guy that couldn\u2019t be honest about what he really felt and wanted at the start.", "I was always ambivalent about having kids, could take them or leave them, but I was extremely clear that I would only have kids with a partner who loves children and enthusiastically wanted them. I now have two kids with a husband whose sun rises and sets with those girls and I couldn\u2019t be happier.", "Exactly. OP needs to ask himself some hard questions and understand his gf has every right to consider her future as much as he does. If you truly hate kids that much stop wasting her time or start committing to the idea of possibly baring their presence one day.", "Or, worst case, he\u2019s going to have them and it\u2019s not going to be different with his own kids like he assumes it will and he\u2019s going to be either a detached/uninvolved unhappy father or just straight up bounce. I would be concerned as well if I were her.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from but just because you aren\u2019t ready and have things to do doesn\u2019t mean you resent the presence of all children no? At the very least it\u2019s not encouraging to see this in your partner as you would have little confidence their feelings will change in the future. \n\nIt\u2019s ok if he isn\u2019t ready and no one should be pushed but I don\u2019t think that is what is happening here. How is it so unbearable to be around a child that you aren\u2019t even responsible for, but then you say you want kids 5 years from now? It doesn\u2019t add up because the aversion to children is so extreme and with no compromise (even if he could be around them sometimes and just tolerate them that would be more believable). \n\nAs a woman I feel like gf might not be in a hurry she might just be worried about the future and need to know now if kids aren\u2019t on the table.", "Fuck tiktok man", "This, plus OP: Having your own kids means you have to be around other people\u2019s kids. Activities, play dates, birthday parties, your kids will want to have friends over.\n\nI say NAH but you might want to really think about this. I\u2019m not a kid person, not even a little. I don\u2019t hate them or anything, but I don\u2019t enjoy the vast majority of them either. Perhaps not surprisingly, this plays into my decision not to have my own.", "I dislike babies and kids. I have two (now adult children). I volunteered in their classroom, coached sports when other parents refused to step up,  and enjoyed MY kids. What OP wants is possible.", "I disagree with this", "This is one of her friends that she sees like twice a year, I haven't seen in 3. Shouldn't be an important part of my life.", "Exactly! I went through a stage of not wanting kids in my early 20\u2019s.. and it took me a lot of soul searching to realise I did want kids, just not with him. I just knew I would have hated being the \u2018main\u2019 parent, always begging him for help and resenting not getting it. \n\nI really love having my daughter with my husband, as he is just as committed as I am and there\u2019s always someone to rely on when things inevitably get tough. And child rearing is tough! I\u2019ve had it relatively \u2018easy\u2019 in that I got a baby that slept through from day 1, so I can only imagine how extraordinarily hard it is for some people that don\u2019t get a sleeper and have to do it all on their own.", ">Sooo I (M25) do not like to be around kids. I don't know how to act around them and am not very fatherly. \n\nINFO: What make you think this will change in 5 years? How will you know how to act around kids when you are never around them?", "You're speaking to people who ARE parents about this. You can't even handle being around your gfs friends kid.", "However it\u2019s important to your girlfriend. But I guess you don\u2019t really care about that.", "Woooow, you have 0 sense of how things work", "Oh wow this is dense. In a relationship what\u2019s important to your partner is important to you.", "YTA\u2014 You\u2019re not an AH for not liking kids. You\u2019re an AH for not wanting to meet someone and engage from time to time with someone who is a big part of your gf\u2019s life. Not saying you have to hang out with them all the time to not be an AH, but it\u2019s pretty baseline to incorporate yourself into your partner\u2019s life and spend a little time with people who are important to them. \n\nAnd are you sure you *actually* want kids in the future? The way your tone is coming across like you\u2019re really averse to being in the presence of children. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t, but if that\u2019s the case, stop wasting both yours and your gfs time.", "YTA? You're a bit over the top, but also I hope you're taking all possible birth control precautions. As the person who has to carry the child, if she does catch, she's probably going to be happy to carry through.", "She doesn\u2019t want her first baby to be the first kid you interact with.  That means she does not want a partner she\u2019s raising a child with who won\u2019t know how to hold, change, feed, interact, raise a baby and who will expect her to do everything.   You think you get the choice to just not engage or know  anything about kids then have her to do everything??", "My son was the first baby I held. I was plenty nervous but the midwife showed me how to carry him and sent us home \nNTA. But I'm thinking your gf isn't entirely on board the \"let's make babies in our 30's\" train. Good luck.", "NTA. I have a friend who\u2019s like you. When we were in uni together, she never liked kids. The rest of us adored kids and she would scoff. Couple of years ago she and her husband had a daughter. She\u2019s an amazing parent. Adores that little girl. Still doesn\u2019t like other kids though. She\u2019s never mean but you could tell she\u2018a uncomfortable. It\u2019s hilarious but no harm considering that little girl she\u2019s raising has great parents who are wonderful to her.", "I have a 4 year old and am trying to have a second, and I still can't stand being around other kids. Partially it comes from parents and others pushing for elaborate interaction between you and the kids and the expectation that you will love this. Many of my friends have chosen not to have children and I make sure that they're not forced to play with mine when they visit by ensuring my kid is involved in an immersive activity. I have a friend who does something similar snd I love visiting her and her kids. Another thing that irritates the hell out of me is people bragging about their kids - having one of my own I enjoy exchanging advice or stories about the children, but the bragging and subsequently expected smiling and nodding just kills me. \n\nI actually think you handled not visiting the baby in a very elegant, non-hurtful way. \nNTA.", "Honestly, it sounds like you need to be child free. If you can\u2019t even be in the same room with one now, you\u2019re not going to want them in five years. And if you have them, you need to be an *active participant* in raising them - playing with them, changing diapers, waking in the middle of the night - the whole shebang. I highly doubt you\u2019ll get there in five years. \n\nNTA for not going to see the friend\u2019s kid. YTA for wasting your girlfriend\u2019s time and dragging her along when you don\u2019t actually want kids.", "NTA but you can be childfree. You don\u2019t have to have kids in the future. Also 30 will be here in no time. May be best to find a partner with the same values as you and let her find a man ready to reproduce.", "OP, please get a vasectomy. They are reversible but they are great birth control. You should not trust your gf to have to get the birth control. Birth control, all of it for women, has a percentage that don't work even an IUD. And your gf will think if she's pregnant then you'll suddenly love babies. You two aren't compatible because of this one issue. And if she gets pregnant and you want nothing to do with it believe that that will mess that kid up. Take a second and imagine, really imagine, that your dad never wanted to see you, never wanted anything to do with you, even if he wasn't in your life. You would know he didn't want you. Now imagine doing that to your own kid. Worse would be getting married and going through the motions. Your kid will know. Make sure you do not have kids. It sounds like gf is in babylove! She will turn up pregnant and expect you to be happy about it. Sooner than not. Please, do not have any babies. Only you can make sure it happens. And if you do nothing about it, it'll happen a lot sooner. And your child will grow up knowing, instinctively, that he was never wanted. \n\nNTA if you're prepared to be responsible.", "NAH but it sounds very much like your gf is worried about your aversion to kids and may be wanting them earlier than you would be comfortable with.\n\nIf she's of an age where her friends and relatives are all having babies, and she's the sort of person who makes plans for her future children, you may be deluding yourself about how compatible you are, and she may be worried you are not in fact father material.\n\nInteracting with other people's children, especially the children of people you care about, is a traditional way of figuring out what your life would look like when you have your own. You don't get a user's manual when your first one pops out. \n\nAre you absolutely sure she wants to wait until she's 30 to get started? Are you absolutely sure that babies will become less annoying to you at that age, a mere 5 years away?", "Yta\n\nNot for not wanting kids right now thats fine but its irrational to avoid and be scared of being enar babies.\n\nMaybe your gf just wants to know if you can even tolerate a baby before spending more effort and time into this relationship. And honestly youre being over dramatic. Is it really that big of a deal to be in the same room as a baby?", "YTA. You say you want to have kids in your thirties. But if you\u2019re so against kids right now that you can\u2019t even stand to celebrate her friend\u2019s kid, I really hope you don\u2019t become a parent. \n\nIf you don\u2019t even like kids in small doses?you\u2019re going to be miserable when you have your own kid, and they\u2019re reliant on you 24/7. \n\nDo NOT promise her you\u2019ll have kids in your thirties because there isn\u2019t magic switch that will automatically make them palatable to you after your thirtieth birthday. You don\u2019t have to have kids now, but you need to start working on liking them asap if you\u2019re serious about having kids", "YTA it\u2019s fine to not like kids but she does. She\u2019s not asking you to have a child she\u2019s asking you to engage with her interest in being around children she loves to be around. It you can\u2019t figure out how to do something you don\u2019t want to do just for the sake of knowing it will make her happy, you\u2019ll lose her. Not to mention that it\u2019s a huge red flag for a guy to say he wants children with you but then acts like you\u2019ve asked to him to step out in traffic just by being around a kid.", "The more that post progressed the more it made me feel like you're misleading your gf into three-four more years of a relationship that isn't going anywhere. Kind of like that Paul Walker Vin Diesel scene where they are taking two different routes. If you despise babies that much, five years from now you are not likely to suddenly love the idea of having one in your home and you'll likely do it just to stay with said gf, or lead her on for a couple more years before she inevitably finds a partner that will be on the same page. I get that you don't like babies, I've met plenty of people like that. But why don't you find someone likeminded? You don't have to have babies just because you're 'supposed' to.\n\nYou're not T A for not liking kids, but...\n\nYTA for lying to your gf and most probably to yourself about wanting to have kids in the future.", "So a buddy of yours has a baby you\u2019d see it, but your gf\u2019s friend who you\u2019re also semi-friends with you don\u2019t want to see because you \u201creally don\u2019t care about this baby\u201d? Ehh.. do you care about your gf enough?\n\nHonestly you two don\u2019t seem compatible at all. She should be able to see that but sometimes those goggles are hard to take off and I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll change some day.", "I think you are wasting your gf's time. Her fertility is fading. Femals don't have endless time to consider back and forth. And you will not magically start to like babies on your 30s birthday. And having a family starts with having babies.", "Bruh wants a family but openly states he doesn't like kids? What's he gonna do - go to the kid shop and buy a couple of 17 year olds?", "This is so ridiculous. I've never liked babies and wouldn't watch tiktoks about them, no way, how boring. But your own kids are obviously very different.\n\n I love my baby! And I don't like babies! But i see my bub as a little man and look forward to him being one. (Or woman, if he decides that). They are not babies or toddlers for long, anyway.", "I really don\u2019t like children but I love mine and love hanging out with them!! And if my husband said oh let\u2019s hang out with my friends and their kids before we had ours I\u2019d definitely say no!!!", "I read OPs post again and I still see that he doesn't really resent children, but that he just has other things he wants to do in his twenties. Even if I read in between the lines I don't see an (extreme) aversion to children, just someone who doesn't want to think about kids and that's good because like he said, he still lives with his parents. I totally get that.", "Teens stuck in Foster Care need love too? \ud83e\udd37", "Exactly, I don't get why people are mad at op for not liking babies. Babies are by definition gross.\n\nI am anti-baby, toddlers are meh, but about age 4 or 5,kids are cool af. I'm willing to suck up dealing with someone I love being in a state I don't like for a while. That's adulting.", "Why do you disagree with this?", "Idk it\u2019s pretty resentful to not visit someone after they\u2019ve just given birth simply because they don\u2019t like kids no? People are allowed to not want kids and he sounds smart for it considering he lives at home but his behaviour is not screaming baby daddy/ie husband material. As a woman I would find it a turn off too.", "I don't think someone that hates kids should be held responsible for any child", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s resentful to not want to visit a person you barely know after they have kids. As he said if his best friend had a kid that would be different. I don\u2019t think this is a red flag tbh. He just wants to enjoy not having kids and being in his 20s for awhile. If anything the girlfriend is a bit pushy. All this obsession forcing him to watch baby tik toks sounds like passive aggressive hinting on her part to push him into having kids now. I am a happily married mother but at that age I would have been annoyed if someone did that to me. I love my kid but was never baby obsessed about other people\u2019s kids. My besties kids absolutely but sone random persons kids I barely know? I don\u2019t think so", "Very true", "I may be missing something but I don\u2019t think he said it would be different if his best friend had a baby? I can\u2019t find where you\u2019re reading that. \n\nGf is probably being a bit pushy too but I just don\u2019t see what the big deal is about visiting your gf\u2019s friend\u2019s kid if you don\u2019t care? I also feel like in a long term relationship surely your partner\u2019s friends are strangers you hardly know?"]}
