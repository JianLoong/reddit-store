I'm a lady who chose to not have kids for many reasons, one of which is that I loathe babies.  There is absolutely nothing about them that I like.  I read that part about her watching baby videos and said \"eww\" out loud.  You're free to have the same opinion, or any other about them. \n\nBut are you sure you and your gf are compatible?  Really, really sure?  She loves babies and kids, and you don't, except to say that you may have them in the future.  Are you saying that because YOU want them or because your gf wants them so much?  Please do not create a new person if you aren't sure that you really, really want that person.  Trust me, even toddlers know when a parent isn't into them, and it's a great way to mess them up. \n\nPlease consider if your and your gf's goals for the future are the same.  You can absolutely love her and still be incompatible.  And if you stay together, this hates-kids-loves-kids thing will become a THING and a breaking point sooner or later, it's one of the few things for which there's no compromise.  One of the few things one must have in common with a longtime partner.  So do some very honest soul searching, okay?", "NAH.  Every argument/conflict does not have someone being an asshole.  And neither of you are assholes.\n\nThat said - you both sound like you are heading towards incompatibility.  Better to address that now, then waiting until 30.  Or even worse, until there is an \"oops\" (intentional or unintentional) and she's pregnant.", "NTA:  Doesn't sound like you two are compatible.  She's angling for you to change all your plans and have a kid asap.  No one who plans to wait years is spending hours watching baby videos.  She's hoping you'll catch the bug too.", "NTA.\n\nPlease leave your girlfriend dude. Whatever you think you want, you clearly don't want kids. People who want kids eventually do not act this way. And your girlfriend def wants kids, maybe on a timeline much sooner than she says. \n\nYou two are not compatible.", "NAH. Sounds like you two are going in different directions in life. Neither is wrong, but it is a factor in the relationship. Clearly she wants you to start showing an interest in these things, and is concerned you are not. Relationships frequently mean compromise, and doing something your partner wants to make them happy. Not doing so doesn't mean your an AH. But it  also is not a great sign for the future of the relationship.", "YTA a bit because you say you want them in the future (at 30) but won\u2019t go near them now (25). Your gf is probably concerned you will get to 30 one day and say you\u2019re not ready. And also you will not be ready if you decide to wing it and learn everything about being a father and being around children for the first time with your own child. \n\nIt sounds like you don\u2019t want kids period. Are you expecting to wake up on your 30th bday and suddenly go \u201cI suddenly want a baby!\u201d  I think your gf can see this flaw in your logic and is concerned that your stubbornness to assert your position only shows your true feelings. \n\nRelationships take compromise and no one is saying having a baby now or ever especially if you don\u2019t want one and are not ready.  However, you should demonstrate to your partner that you are willing SOME day to be a parent and a good one at that, and recoiling at the presence of any child just simply won\u2019t demonstrate that. \n\nHave a good think about what you want and best of luck!", "NAH but you don't seem compatible. She's trying to see what life with kids with you would be like and you're not showing her a great picture. I'd be turned off too, but I don't know why neither one of you has broken it off yet. Doesn't seem like it's going to work.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m gonna be honest with you OP. You two do not appear to be compatible", "You guys sound like a toxic couple.  In your brief story you have hinted at several key issues in your relationship.", "NAH but why don\u2019t you just admit to yourself that you don\u2019t actually want kids? No one who wants to be a parent hates children this much. \n\nBe real with yourself. This is ridiculous.", "NAH but seriously, if it will kill you to go meet a new person that is apart of your GF's life you should reconsider having children. If you avoid children like the plague and get frustrated by your GF's hopes and dreams of a family one day, you two are incompatible. And you are talking about which sports you will sign your kids up for? FYI not all kids are into sports. Will you be disappointed if your children don't enjoy the same sports you do? You should evaluate WHY you want children. So far, it sounds like either selfish reasons or because that's just what a guy does in his 30s.", "I can see how you'd be \"spooked\" by your gf watching baby videos and stuff because you said you don't want them at all right now, but tbh I think you should be happy she loves baby's so much because if you REALLY do want kids like you say you do, she sounds like she would be a very active and loving mother. If you say you both are on the same page about waiting to have a family, I don't see what the big deal is about going to see a baby or a toddler with her? She just wants to do something she enjoys with you. Who knows, you might fall in love with her even more after seeing how great she is with kids. Or, you might realize you dislike kids and don't want them at all. Idk you kind of seem like the type of dad who would never get up in the middle of the night, change a single diaper or feed the baby(I could be wrong). You said yourself you're not very \"fatherly.\" I think you're kidding yourself when you say you want kids. You want to be in your late 50s picking your kids up from high school", "YTA for absurd use of the word \"boundary\".\n\nIt's fine not to want kids. From your post, it sounds like you don't actually like your gf much, so I'm not sure why you're a couple.\n\nI will note that there's a big difference between \"I'm not ready for kids now, because I have other things I want to do first\" and \"I don't want to touch a baby because I can't stand them\". I don't really see how you move from the latter position to \"we do want to have kids in the future\" if you can't bring yourself to interact with a baby now.", "NTA at all not everyone likes kids and that\u2019s okay but you and your girlfriend need to break up or have a serious conversation about the near future.\n\nIn my honest opinion 25 is too old to have no desire to move out and mature in life especially when you say you want a kid in the next 5 years and that does not mean starting a family. It just means that you aren\u2019t a teenager anymore and unless you have personal issues like healthy, family issues or financial issues beyond your control (choosing not to work doesn\u2019t count) then you should be looking to move out and prepare for having kids in the next 5 years which you said yourself you want to do. You also need to find yourself and get used to an environment without your immediate family in your life every day and start to mature as an adult. 5 years isn\u2019t a long time and you should have a stable income and home ready by then if you want kids then.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like other people\u2019s children then you\u2019re also not going to enjoy being a father. Being a parent means play dates, birthday parties, meeting other parents and their kids, baby sitting etc and it will badly affect your child and girlfriend trying to isolate from those duties. It\u2019s okay to choose to not have kids. You shouldn\u2019t have a kid just because you like the idea of having a family. \n\nYour girlfriend also isn\u2019t in the wrong at all. Women\u2019s fertility especially if they have issues with their periods (like undiagnosed or diagnosed endometriosis, pcos etc) can affect fertility after 25 so I completely understand why she wants kids and she\u2019s at a totally reasonable age to want to start a family.\n\nIt just sounds like you\u2019re totally incompatible and this should be discussed. Maybe she\u2019ll be willing to wait until you\u2019re both ready but neither of you should be sacrificing your own boundaries for each other.", "Well, it's fine not to want kids right now and you don't have to spend time with them. But I don't think you're going to suddenly change your mind about kids when you turn thirty. It's quite possible you'll still want to be child-free, which is fine, but your girlfriend will be upset about that. And there's also the possibility that she could get pregnant before thirty. If your girlfriend waits until after thirty to get pregnant, it could possibly take longer than it would now. And I think you're avoiding being around kids because you can sense that your girlfriend wants to have kids sooner rather than later.", "Your gf clearly wants a baby, probably sooner than later. You don\u2019t any time soon. It\u2019s obvious that you have hit a fork in the road, relationship-wise, and you each are walking down a different path. It may be kinder to let her go so she can find someone to build a family with on her timeline.", "You are not TA for not liking kids. Some do, some don\u2019t. She certainly has done nothing wrong. \n\nBut YWBTA if you do not let her find someone to share her life with that wants the same things as she does. A baby. A family. Soon. \n\nNot feeling ready for kids and wanting freedom in your 20s is absolutely not the same thing as actively disliking children. \n\nYou are not compatible. You think you\u2019ll want a family in your 30s the same way kids want a puppy. Until they actually have to take care of it. Constant attention. You\u2019re never alone. Can\u2019t pee in private. Have to shift your entire life around to make sure you\u2019re giving them the attention and exercise they need\u2026the analogy has gone on long enough. \n\nYou like the idea of a family in the future. I seriously doubt you\u2019ll actually want one. In the meanwhile you\u2019re stringing her along during the prime time to find someone truly compatible.", "Umm I don\u2019t think you should have any children at all in the future because if you feel that way now about even being around them I don\u2019t think you should even have a thought in mind about having any but you have your own thoughts and choices too make which I don\u2019t wrong you on it but I don\u2019t think this particular relationship is for you but that\u2019s My opinion, But if she\u2019s still the one for you buckle up with protection sir because sometimes the one\u2019s who don\u2019t want children pop up with the surprise of a lifetime with a child they weren\u2019t ready for or never wanted to have. Play it safe and good luck sir. NTA but save her and yourself from heartache you two are on different pages in life.", "YTA. This is such a red flag my dude I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s still with you. Kids don\u2019t magically become palatable when you reach an arbitrary age. They\u2019re messy and stinky and clingy and whiny and depend on you for their entire existence, and if you can\u2019t bear to be in the presence of a child now you aren\u2019t going to want to get up with one 6 times a night, and if you don\u2019t want to do that, don\u2019t get that girl pregnant ever. You\u2019re not TA for not wanting to be around kids, that\u2019s fully your choice, but YTA for pretending like you want to be in this relationship or have children because you like the idea of a family.", "YTA it doesnt sound like you do want kids and i think your gf is starting to realize that.", "NTA\n\nThe devil on my shoulder says you should tell her. \"You really want to expose me to young children after I tell you I'm not interested.

Just be realistic about the situation.", "YTA:  When someone tells you who they are... believe them.  This stupidity? Right here? That's how dumb guys get babytrapped.

But neither of us hated kids and anyone mentioning them for years? Dude, that's . . . why would anyone think you're going to magically start liking kids at 30? Or be a good father?\n\nIf you think of dating as sort of a trial period to see if you fit together, you'd fail that trial period and I'd move on. It's fine to be child free, but your girlfriend loves and wants children and you are sending all the red flags that you'll either never want kids or be resentful uninvolved dad. My childfree friends and brother don't act like you. Your whole active dislike of babies and children isn't really normal to me. Children are people so I also think I'd just mind beacuse disliking any group of people for being born seems uncool.", "I think the opposite is much more likely in this situation, that they\u2019ll get to 30 and OP will realise he doesn\u2019t actually want kids at all and gf will have wasted 10 years of her life with a guy that couldn\u2019t be honest about what he really felt and wanted at the start.", "I was always ambivalent about having kids, could take them or leave them, but I was extremely clear that I would only have kids with a partner who loves children and enthusiastically wanted them. I now have two kids with a husband whose sun rises and sets with those girls and I couldn\u2019t be happier.", "Exactly. OP needs to ask himself some hard questions and understand his gf has every right to consider her future as much as he does.

I would be concerned as well if I were her.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from but just because you aren\u2019t ready and have things to do doesn\u2019t mean you resent the presence of all children no?

How is it so unbearable to be around a child that you aren\u2019t even responsible for, but then you say you want kids 5 years from now? It doesn\u2019t add up because the aversion to children is so extreme and with no compromise (even if he could be around them sometimes and just tolerate them that would be more believable). \n\nAs a woman I feel like gf might not be in a hurry she might just be worried about the future and need to know now if kids aren\u2019t on the table.", "Fuck tiktok man", "This, plus OP: Having your own kids means you have to be around other people\u2019s kids.

I just knew I would have hated being the \u2018main\u2019 parent, always begging him for help and resenting not getting it. \n\nI really love having my daughter with my husband, as he is just as committed as I am and there\u2019s always someone to rely on when things inevitably get tough. And child rearing is tough!

I have a friend who does something similar snd I love visiting her and her kids. Another thing that irritates the hell out of me is people bragging about their kids - having one of my own I enjoy exchanging advice or stories about the children, but the bragging and subsequently expected smiling and nodding just kills me. \n\nI actually think you handled not visiting the baby in a very elegant, non-hurtful way. \nNTA.", "Honestly, it sounds like you need to be child free.

I do think before you have kids you should spend more time with babies, with their parents and actually see what it's like, not just whatever potentially romantic notions of parenthood you currently have.

She doesn't deserve to be dragged along for 5 more years and you not ever want kids. Be honest with yourself and her.", "YTA a bit-- not for not liking kids, that's perfectly fine, but it's obvious that she wants them now and you don't, and continuing to string her along with the idea that somehow at 30 you'll magically change into someone who likes kids is... unkind.\n\nEdited to add: also, I'm gonna go ahead and award automatic AH points purely for use of the phrase \"gives her that good ole baby fever\".

Every time she sees babies/infants her maternal clock ticks faster and faster. She will NOT hold out until your both in your 30s. Also, your what, 25 now? Do you know when you'll be 30? If you said \"in 5 years time\" then you're wrong. It'll be in about 2 months time! That's what it'll feel like when you look back from there. And you think that your opinion is going to completely flip in that time? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Methinks you are lying to yourself! So down to the actual question: no, you're NTA for not wanting to be around them now, but you will be T..A.. if you think your opinion will change radically enough in the time it takes your gf to decide she wants babies herself, which will be in 2 maybe 3 years at the most. I don t hold out much hope for your relationship long term!", "YTA - Yes not wanting kids is fine but you're acting in an incredibly immature way that is just down-right weird.\n\n>I want NOTHING to do with them right now. We both still live with our parents for frig sake.\n\nTake this for example. What does living with your parents have to do with visiting a friend who happens to have a baby? Does living with your parents mean that you can't enter a building that contains another persons baby?\n\n>tells me that our future baby WILL NOT be the first child I hold. Lol, like she's demanding this of me.\n\nIt's pretty normal for a person to hold another person's baby at some point. I'd say 99% of the human race have held a baby before they had one of their own. It's not a \"demand\" for her to point out this basic fact.\n\nLook I find kids annoying as shit too and I don't enjoy holding a baby. But you seem to have taken this to some obnoxious level where you straight up block anything that could possibly involve a child. A relationship takes two to tango so either stop holding her back and break up or stop being a giant kid (ironic) and realise that now you are an ADULT you will be around kids sometimes. You aren't a teenager anymore.", "NTA.  OP, you sound very much like my now husband and father of three children.  He knew he wanted kids one day, but he just wasn\u2019t interested in other people\u2019s children.  He is from quite a small family (only has 1 cousin) so was never really around young children.\n\nMe, on the other hand, am from a huge family.  I have always wanted children and I love being around babies.  Having had exposure to lots of bubbas growing up, I am very comfortable around them and know how to handle them.  \n\nHolding newborns can be really daunting, and I imagine you are also a little bit apprehensive about not knowing exactly what to do!  And that is totally ok.  No one should expect you to know, or make you feel guilty or force you to do something you currently have no interest in.\n\nWe didn\u2019t talk time frames regarding when to start a family but we got together when he was 25, me 26.  We both just knew we were meant to be and that was it.  We got married at 30 and had our first child at 32.  He is, without a doubt, the most amazing Dad and husband.  Very present, comes to all of the awards and special events at school.\n\nMaybe you and GF need to have a chat to reevaluate expectations and timeframes.", "I hate other peoples children and actively avoid them and I\u2019m a mother to three children.

You do realise that, right?", "I hate children but love my own three. You don\u2019t need to love other peoples children to love your own. It\u2019s really not that deep.", "That\u2019s a good way of putting it lol", "Story time! I'm not sure if my father really wanted children, or if he just liked some abstract idea of \"having a family\" and went along with what my mother wanted. Either way, he doesn't really like babies and toddlers, and claims he can't really bond with children under a certain age because they can't hold a conversation. As a result, he figured that he could just postpone bonding with my brother and me until we were older.\n\nThat plan didn't work. My brother and I definitely picked up on the fact that our parent didn't really want to be around us, and this kept us from bonding once we did reach that wonderful age where we could hold a conversation. It's also one of the reasons we both struggled with depression as children. Neither of us really talk to him now, and he doesn't seem to understand why we don't magically have a good relationship. Oh, and his continued refusal/inability to spend any (quality) time with his kids also did some serious damage to his relationship with my mother. \n\nOP, think long and hard about whether you really want/like kids. Really examine what it looks like when you imagine your future self \"having a family\".

Babies are HARD. And boring. They do nothing. Even my dad, a veteran school teacher, openly admits babies are boring and he was the granddad that held all the babies and taught them to stick their tongues out.
