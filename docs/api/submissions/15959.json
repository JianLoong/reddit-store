They created this division and let the blame fall squarely on your shoulders.\n\nReturn blame to sender.  \u201cMom and dad told me to do xyz, so that is what I\u2019m doing!\u201d", "INFO: what is the basis for thinking that maybe one day Harry will be able to get a job and earn a modest living? The core premise of your second paragraph is that Harry \u201cisn\u2019t working and probably never will\u201d which is completely at odds with this? Is it just wishful thinking on your part?", "NTA- You were put in charge of the money for this reason.  However,  death and money always creates a shit show.   Your options are: just give older brother his third and never talk money again. Or, give each a percentage like you said and put the remainder in a trust for younger brother. You will be talking money from here on out though.  Can you live with that? It might be best to do option 1 for a peaceful living. It is up to you to take your third too.  If you will be a caretaker of sort, then you probably deserve it. God bless and good luck!", "Steve can have 100% if he'll care for Harry full-time.", "NA. Your mother left you in charge and you seem to follow her wishes. You are not taking money for yourself and you approach is very reasonable,", "NTA. Your parents left it up to you to distribute their possessions as you see fit, and you all agreed that Harry should benefit more from the inheritance due to his disabilities and lack of income. It's understandable that Steve wants his fair share, but it's important to prioritize Harry's needs at this time. Your suggestion of taking a smaller share now and keeping the rest to support Harry is a reasonable compromise. If Harry doesn't end up needing the money in the future, then Steve will receive his full share. It's unfortunate that Steve is upset, but ultimately, you're doing what's best for your family.", "NTA you sound like you are being very responsible and thinking ahead. Who does Steve think will pay for Harry\u2019s care in the future if he\u2019s unable to get a job? Stick to your guns. And my sincere condolences to you and your brothers.", "NTA. Your parents wanted you to take care of Harry and split everything else up. Maybe see if you can up Steve\u2019s to 15-20% initially, if that will leave enough left to care for Harry long term of course. I get Steve wants his share, but you are following your parents wishes, so I would lay the blame on them. They should have set it up so they left the majority to Harry with you as oversight, and split the rest between you and Steve. It\u2019s a tough position to be in, but you are doing the right thing.", "NTA. \n\nI can't imagine not wanting your disabled sibling not to be fully cared for. That's best for EVERYONE in the family because then his care won't ever fall to one of you full time. That said it's pretty obvious Steve wouldn't take care of him full time. \n\nDo what was discussed with your parents and family originally.", "I think I want to say NAH.\n\nThis is a good one. \n\nI see both points of view here. But I do side with Steve more. Harry is going to require care whether he has inheritance or not. Harry also probably has some sort of disability income and depending on the severity of his condition not nearly as much need for \"extra money\". \n\nSteve on the other hand can use that money to get a jump start in life. That could be his safety net, his college fund/payment, A down payment on a house so he doesn't have to be a renter forever. So many things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA. Maybe talking to Steve about leaving everything in a savings account for a couple years to see if Harry can live independently so the money can be shared more equally. Earn some interest off it for everyone then make the decision when it's clearer what Harry will need.", "Your parents are TA for not having something more concrete. Depending on where you live your brother could sue the estate for his third.", "NTA\n\nYour parents left you in charge of the possessions for a reason; Harry is disabled, and Steve is selfish. \n\nThis is exactly why you were chosen.\n\nStand your ground and respect the intentions of your parents. \n\nAnd Steve's friends need to mind their own business. What are they thinking; your mother just died and you'll have to take on overseeing your disabled brother but somehow they think they have the right to complain to you about a something that is none of their business. \n\nConsider this, if Harry is never independent and your parents money runs out, who do you think will be shouldered with his expenses?\n\nSteve needs to stop being greedy.", "I think you're in a no win situation. Your parents are TAs here for making you make this decision. They should have set things up themselves, because it's going to cause conflict if it's done however you think is best. I think your best options are either to refuse to take on the responsibility and let the court decide what happens or split everything equally, because there's no way for you not to get the brunt of anger over unequal treatment. NTA, but I feel for your position.", "NTA at all. I'm sorry you're in this position. Mom left the money for you to give out as you see fit. Y'all already agreed on giving Harry more to help. Now that you actually are, Steve realizes what he's done and wants to go back. The money should go to who needs it most which seems to be Harry", "NTA. Where I live, you would have to set everything aside in trust for Harry. You and Steve would not receive anything. You should check the law on this in your jurisdiction.", "OP you're going to need to set up some type of trust with what you have received from your parent's estate, because in the interim until you're able to potentially able to get your brother on some type of assistance, it can at least be protected and not potentially considered taxable income (see an asset attorney) to help you get this set up.  You'll also need to have the situation prepared in the event that if something happens to you a trustee takes over and helps make sure that your brother Harry is taken care of, so that your other brother doesn't take the balance of the monies.", "NTA\n\nSorry you were put in this tough position; have to agree I wish your parents had set something up more specific for Harry and had chosen another relative or someone close to be executor \n\nBecause now you\u2019re stuck in the middle, with one brother upset he\u2019s not getting a third \u2014 which doesn\u2019t seem realistic since he agreed Harry would almost surely need more \u2014 and making sure your other brother is taken care of. And I have to guess all three of you are grieving. \n\nWhat you proposed seems reasonable to me, some money now but hold the rest bc it sounds like your brother Harry may need a lot of support, possibly for the rest of his life", "Good question and sorry I\u2019m so unclear! Basically, maybe it is wishful thinking - Harry\u2019s gained much more skills and independence than his doctors, teachers, and my parents ever thought he would be, but that\u2019s not yet at a point where a job is feasible. It might be he carries on developing and could get a small part-time job but realistically that\u2019s a good few years away, if ever. The main thing on my end is I don\u2019t want to give up that hope for him, as he says it\u2019s something he\u2019d like to do one day!", "Thank you for your thoughts! Just for info, as I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s super clear - Harry\u2019s not eligible for disability income in this moment. That\u2019s because of our broken social security system - he\u2019s unable to do the things we need to live independently, like cook/maintain personal hygiene/manage money/wash clothes etc. I want him reassessed ASAP but this money, for now, would really be used to fund his life, as previously my parents were doing that (with me and Steve helping of course!)", "NTA. You\u2019re in an unenviable position and not to disparage your parents, but they kinda passed the buck on this. Have you sought advice from a financial planner re: setting up a trust to ensure Harry is taken care of, if he stays in much the same situation as he has to date, but that would also allow you to disburse additional funds to you or your brother if Harry did gain some degree of financial independence?", "Keep pushing for that disability. Almost everyone is denied originally but in the end people who are fully functional, but simply lazy, are able to get it. (Got a few in my family) I've got no doubt harry qualifies, You just gotta keep the pressure on.", "INFO: have you discussed this with a lawyer? \n\nJust because your parents wrote it in a will doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s legal.  And you don\u2019t want to drain the estate fighting court battles with your brother. \n\nGo see a lawyer and make sure you are legally in the right.", "NTA sounds like there's a reason your parents left this to you instead of Steve", "OP, this situation is so much bigger than AITA. You're not an AH for looking after your brother but please remember to look after yourself too. The comment about Harry not qualifying for support concerned me as someone who has worked with adults with autism and learning disabilities. \n\n\nHarry SHOULD be getting support. He may not need care staff, but that doesn't mean he should be totally free of support. If he cannot live independently there's shared group homes that help people learn life skills. There's charities that will help with skills building, activities, employment opportunities, socialisation and general life skills. He should be recieving benefits if he is unable to work. You and Harry aren't in this alone and support is out there for both of you.", "NTA. Gee, I wonder why his friends are getting on your case about it as if they have any right to chime in.", "If you are in the US I can help you potentially with info on a program he would likely be eligible for. Also disability programs routinely especially in the US reject applicants the first time. Getting a disability attorney to help him get approval would be a good idea. \n\nYou mentioned in comments he can\u2019t manage many of his ADL\u2019s (activities of daily living) which individuals who are disabled often require assistance or prompting from a caregiver to ensure their needs are being met. Your brother should be eligible for whatever resources are available.", "If you agreed this as a family and now Steve's asking for the agreement to be changed you are NTA but do get legal advice on this right away.\n\nDEFINITELY don't give Steve a third if it means you give your share to Harry. That would be extremely unfair and presumably totally against your mother's wishes.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. It sounds like your parents left you everything, trusting, that you would see to the care of Harry. \u201cTo distribute as you see fit\u201d \n\nYou, \u201csee fit\u201d to see that Harry is taken care of. Talk to a financial planner about a trust for Harry. You know what your parents intended. Sadly, death and money brings out the worst in people.", "You are in a really tough spot. One brother has a disability requiring lifelong assistance which costs money. The other is frustrated that means he doesn't get the third share he would have if your brother didn't have autism. \n\nIt's not fair that your parents have left you in that awkward position by not having a will and trust for your brother to take the decision away from you.\n\nNTA - But you probably need legal advice on the best steps to take before your brother tries to take you to court.", "NTA You're parents put you in charge because they knew you would be pragmatic about planning for Harry's future.", "This.  The parents definitely dropped the ball here in a big way."]}
