I won't say the name of the condition because not a lot of people have it. Anyway, she got diagnosed when she was 9, and when I was 16. It didn't really affect me at first. That is until her first surgery. It was understandable that my mom and dad were worried, and were always at the hospital. I was always left at home alone with the responsibility to cook, clean, do responsibility, with no one else there to help. One week of this was enough. My sister was discharged and everything went back to normal for 6 months.\n\n6 months later, at 3am, my parents and sister left to go to the hospital and left me this note:\n\n\"Hi, \n\nYour sister had a relaspe, we are at the hosptial. You can either walk or get a ride to your volleyball game today.\n\nLove, \n\nMom and Dad\"\n\nI was hurt, because this was the biggest game of the season, and no one was there to watch me, but I understood that health came first. We won the game, and my neighbors felt so bad for me they had me over for dinner. They hate having people over. A few days later my sister got discharged. \n\n2 months later, she had to be rushed to the ER because of an emergency, and my parents told me they wanted the house clean by the time they got home. I obeyed and they were pleased. \n\nFast forward to now, (2 years later), I got drafted to one of the biggest volleyball teams in my area, and I wanted my family to see me play at the Championship game. My mom said no, and that my sister had an appointment that day. She made the appointment yesterday, when she's known about my game for months. She's also been putting off meeting my girlfriend, saying that she needs to be available if my sister needs anything. \n\nToday I finally snapped. I said how ever since I was 16 I've been pushed to the side, bullied, and ignored. The least you could do is have dinner with me and my girlfriend or come see me play volleyball for once. She said I was being an entitled brat, and she told me not to call her until I fix my attitude. \n\nI just wanted to feel good about myself for once.

Your mom and dad are always going to put you second fiddle to your sister's illness.  That is unfortunate because it is like they forgot you are their child too.  You're not the housekeeper or the leftover kid, but you have been slapped with that title.  I hope your championship game is triumphant for you and I hope it continues to open doors to opportunities for you.  At this point, as hard as it is, do not worry about your parents showing up or not.  You worry about doing your best and excelling in a sport you obsviously love.

Mom is probably burnt out trying to deal with all the medical stuff but that doesn't make things easier for you. I'm really sorry you're having this experience. Support is so important.

This was not bullying. So far you have been \"pushed aside\" 3 times, 2 of which were entirely unpredictable emergency visits and one was a major surgery, and have not indicated that it has impacted your daily life or that your weekly responsibilities have been changed.

Your parents and sister would much rather go to all of your games than deal with this but that is just not the hand you were dealt and I understand better than you may think and I am very sorry for what all of you are going through. I know you are under stress from the game and probably post-high school stuff looming and normal teen life but lashing out at them is cruel and won't make you feel good.

They have a sick kid. And emergency trip to the hospital take priority. As does specialist appointments. And you mum may have only just books an appointment the day before, but that means one of either 2 things: 1) the appointment was extremely urgent, so they squeezed her in, or 2) they had a cancellation that they could squeeze her in. Generally specialist appointments can be months (or even year) long waits depending on where you live. Either way, both take priority over a sport. \n\nYou have no comprehension of what it is to be a parent, and the stress and worry of medical issues, and potientially losing one of your children. You need to realise that sometimes, somethings are more important then what is going on in your own world. And what feels so important to you at 16 years old, really just isn't that big a deal in the grand scheme of things. \n\nI am prepared to be voted down for this comment, because I know a lot of teenagers and young adults will take exception to this, because they also lack the understanding that parents do sometimes need to prioritize and triage problems.

This started as a sad fact of life: you have a sister who needs to go to the hospital sometimes for life or death reasons. Nobody could control that, and therefore a few times you fended for yourself. You were old enough to do so, and it sucked and was hard, but wasn't the end of the world. However this isn't life or death. This isn't an urgency that had to be put to the top of the list. This was a routine appointment, that could've been pushed to another time and they still didn't consider you. You were their child too. You matter too. And it would be different if she had come to you and said, I'm so sorry honey I won't be able to make your game, this is urgent. When can I see you play next? But she is appalled that you even suggested she make an effort to support you and that's unacceptable. \n\nI'd also like to add: even on my worst pain days, even at my lowest, i always made an effort to be my sister's biggest supporter.

I think 'neglecting' is a bit of a harsh term here.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Asking a (at the time) 16 year old to cook and clean for one single week because the parents are dealing with an emergency seems totally fine to me. \n- Missing one volleybal game due to an ER-emergency: again, necessary and hardly neglectful.\n- Asking a 16 (maybe already 17?) year old months later to clean the house for one time only because again, emergency: not neglectful or wrong in my book. This was *months* after the other hospitalizations, so it wasn't like OP - a near adult at the time - was asked to clean all the time.\n- Missing a volleyball game TWO YEARS LATER because of an appointment.. hmm.. depends. If the appointment could have easily been made any other day, kind of sucky. But on the other hand, the parents missed two(!) games in two years. I honestly don't see how that is them *always putting sister first*.\n\nI'm sorry OP, but in my opinion you're making a way bigger deal out of this than it is (apart from the last appointment perhaps). What did you expect your parents to do, not go to the hospital with a sick child because of a sport's game? Not ask you for (checks notes) 8 days of help in the household in two years?

I don't know if you've heard of weaponized incompetence, but this is what you need to do until you are old enough to move out. They tell you to clean the house? Do it, but do it incompetently. They want you to cook dinner? Do it, but  make sure you forget the salt. Or sugar. So the food tastes like crap. As long as your parents are doing NOTHING for you, i.e. they're not even being a parent. They're keeping you alive, that is all, and that's NOT parenting. As long as they keep this up, you keep up the facade of being completely incompetent. Do whatever they tell you to do, but do it terribly. Soon, they'll stop telling you to do stuff. Or if they get mad and yell at you for doing everything wrong, just be like, \"I'm just following your example of being poor parents. You being a poor parent just tells me that I can do everything I don't feel like doing poorly, too\".", "She scheduled it a few days out.  So I don't think so.", "Probably not, just a possibility. There's also the possibility this isn't a specialist visit at all. Most specialists for *recurring* appointments tend to future schedule you before you leave. My neuro is every 6 months.
