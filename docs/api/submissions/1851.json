They have a sick kid. And emergency trip to the hospital take priority. As does specialist appointments. And your mum may have only just booked an appointment the day before, but that means one of either 2 things: 1) the appointment was extremely urgent, so they squeezed her in, or 2) they had a cancellation that they could squeeze her in. Generally specialist appointments can be months (or even year) long waits depending on where you live. Either way, both take priority over a sport. \n\nYou have no comprehension of what it is to be a parent, and the stress and worry of medical issues, and potientially losing one of your children.

Nobody could control that, and therefore a few times you fended for yourself. You were old enough to do so, and it sucked and was hard, but wasn't the end of the world. However this isn't life or death. This isn't an urgency that had to be put to the top of the list. This was a routine appointment, that could've been pushed to another time and they still didn't consider you. You were their child too. You matter too.

I think 'neglecting' is a bit of a harsh term here.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- Asking a (at the time) 16 year old to cook and clean for one single week because the parents are dealing with an emergency seems totally fine to me. \n- Missing one volleybal game due to an ER-emergency: again, necessary and hardly neglectful.\n- Asking a 16 (maybe already 17?) year old months later to clean the house for one time only because again, emergency: not neglectful or wrong in my book. This was *months* after the other hospitalizations, so it wasn't like OP - a near adult at the time - was asked to clean all the time.\n- Missing a volleyball game TWO YEARS LATER because of an appointment.. hmm.. depends.

As long as your parents are doing NOTHING for you, i.e. they're not even being a parent. They're keeping you alive, that is all, and that's NOT parenting. As long as they keep this up, you keep up the facade of being completely incompetent. Do whatever they tell you to do, but do it terribly. Soon, they'll stop telling you to do stuff.

I\u2019ve been through my share\u2026 \n\nYou have your health and opportunities, down side is on occasions your parents have had to put you second.\nYour sister has a rare disease and has to be hospitalised\u2026 no chance of a game and independence like staying home and taking the fort or probably even dating (not sure of the illness)\nYour parents are in a no win situation and have chosen to support your sick sibling. \nA game or possibly the last time they see her???\n\nI mean as a brother maybe put things in perspective. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you surprise them with dinner waiting for them with your GF. A virtual experience.\n\nYour mum probably has unresolved trauma going on and can\u2019t even put her own needs first. Not to mention the financial burden.\n\nSo count your blessings that the worst thing to happen to you is having to take care of yourself for a bit and a few games missed. \n\nYou have a home and family and they are doing their best. Appointments are also hard to reschedule so her hands were probably tided. \n\nShe probably does feel bad and doesn\u2019t need you making her feel bad. That\u2019s not helpful because she still need to put medical need first.", "Nah. Look medical need aid a family members always come before everything else. I get you want your parents to be there to watch you participate in a sport. It isn\u2019t a need, it\u2019s a nice to have.  \n\nTalk to you parents and tell them you want more time from them and ask if they can manage in a way that still takes care of your sisters medical needs of course but carve out some time for you.", "I get that but I don\u2019t know about the hospitals near you but they have different days for different outpatient clinics, like the cancer ward for instance one day might be bowel cancer the next day thyroid. Sometimes you can only make appointments on certian days", "Its not parentification to expect a 16 year old to not let house go into ruin when parents leave for a week. It should be part of their life to clean at least a part of the house or clean it sometimes. He's complaining because he's asked to do what any functional member of society does.", "There are two parents. It's understandable that dealing with medical conditions suck but OP was ignored by his (or her) parents. One could go with sister to hospital and second parent could support his older child at least from time to time. \n\n16 years olds are still kids and they need help, support and attention from their parents.\n\nInstead OP was made to take care of his own and was made to be a maid. \n\nStop being ignorant. One childs medical problems do not justify ignoring the other childs needs.", "THANK YOU! Everyone thinks that it's reasonable to drop a sick minor who needs to go to ER because a sweet boy plays at his high school game. \n\nOf course id rather see my daughter die than to give up on one of many games my son will play /s\n\nAnd as you said, occasional cleaning and cooking for yourself should be a norm for any teen. And especially now that OP is supposedly an adult and should know cleaning and cooking is a daily occurrence.", "It seems like OP was ignored by their parents again and again and again. He/she has two parents.  One can go with sister to hospital, second can spend time with him/her. 16 year old kids are still kids and they need their parents time, support and attention.", "In the post OP is very clear they understand that sister\u2019s (or anyone\u2019s) health comes first, but at the same time they are also their kid and they need to be there for her too. Or at a minimum set her up with friends and family while they are gone so she isn\u2019t alone fending for herself and has people there to support. The examples you listed were given were to establish a pattern of not being there for their kid. It\u2019s not as if that\u2019s the entire list of times they weren\u2019t there for their kid/asked them to step up. It sounds like your trivializing a pattern of behavior that\u2019s honestly could be pretty damaging for any kid.\n\nOP you\u2019re NTA - while you\u2019re blessed to not have the health issues your sister deals with, it\u2019s okay to be mad that it seems like they checked out of parenting you. Your sister getting sick doesn\u2019t absolve them of also being your parent. I\u2019m so sorry you haven\u2019t been getting the support you need, but glad you\u2019re making a life for yourself.", "OP indicated this has been happening throughout a 2 year period. \u201cI was always left at home alone to do cooking, cleaning and do responsibility with no one to help,\u201d and \u201cever since I was 16, I was pushed to the side, bullied and ignored.\u201d OP did mention that one week of this was enough, but did not specify that they ceased to do it after a week, just that they\u2019d had enough after a week. \n\nTelling OP they wanted the house clean by the time they got home, seems usual to blurt out of the blue. Nobody is talking to OP about the responsibilities and what will happen if there is an emergency, they are just dumping on OP and expecting OP to \u201cdo as they\u2019re told.\u201d \n\nOP has indicated that they haven\u2019t attend any of their games in that time \u201cthe least you can do is have dinner with me and my girlfriend or see me play volleyball for once.\u201d\n\nOPs role in the family has been reduced from child, to a secondary parent who assumes responsibilities usually expected from a parent such house household duties and other responsibilities that OP has not specified. OP has indicated that they are completely alone during this time. They show this by prioritising OPs sister in all ways, both social and emotional. These milestones are important in OPs life. \nOP was 16 when this began, a critical time during adolescence when you need a parent more than ever before. For advice, for guidance and support. OP is not getting any of that. Furthermore, OP is completely invalidated of their experiences when trying to remedy the issue. When you deny another persons reality you\u2019re gaslighting them.", "You can't go to a game, when you're afraid your child is going to die. Do you have a heart?", "Hmm. I wonder though. That\u2019s a lot of negative energy to invest in something that\u2019s most likely going to fuel mom & dad\u2019s \u201centitled brat behavior\u201d narrative. Not to mention trying to out-manipulate someone who strategically asks for chores to be done during times of family crises sounds futile. I doubt parents like that would ever wave a white flag. And OP would very likely face a plethora of consequences for that behavior being that she is still the child in this situation subject to whatever discipline her parents see fit.", "I get this, but I think the OP should hunt for another place to live since he or she must be close to 18. \n\nAnd I would go NC with Mommy Dearest, and LC with dad. And I would let Dad make all the contact unless it is a dire emergency. \n\nThis is a one-way relationship, and OP is getting nothing out of it.", "OP mentions being 16 when it all started, so I'm pretty sure they're old enough to be able to move out soon, at least.", ">This is a one-way relationship, and OP is getting nothing out of it.\n\nAgree with this. I really hate people who have multiple kids when they are unable to be fair to both when shit happens. If you're gonna put all your attention and effort into one kid, maybe then just have only one kid, or NO KIDS AT ALL.", "God YTA, this was exhausting to read. I can\u2019t imagine being so entitled to think that cooking & cleaning for yourself at 16 years old is a hardship. I think the only reason your mom could even remotely suck is that she made the appointment after knowing your tournament schedule, but appointments are hard to get, especially if it\u2019s for something as rare as what your sister has. I think you have a lot of growing up to do, and you need to realize that you are not a martyr, and haven\u2019t been asked to do anything more than the bare minimum", "NTA. Start planning to get out of the house when you're 18. That means notarized birth certificate, lifelong vax records, etc. Work and save your money---under the mattress if you have to, so it can't disappear BCS the family needs it.", "NTA. Unfortunately not your sisters fault but your parents for throwing you away like that. Anyone who has multiple kids needs to take care of those multiple kids and not just cut back on one because one is more ill. I hope you find healing and cut them off you are not a house maid and you deserve so much more love", "Nta, it's no fun being a glass child", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your sister\u2019s health has caused this to happen. As the sick sibling, I have watched my parents worry over me but they never neglected my sister (even if she did get shuffled around between friends and family during the worst of it).\n\nYou deserve more.", "NTA\n\nI understand their concern - but to treat you like an unpaid maid like they did.. \n\nNot on - and making an appointment KNOWING dates - that basically tells me you are sadly correct in your assumption.   \nBut - the bright side - you can cook, clean etc - so you will make it on your own.  \nSeems they will not miss a child - but they might be pissed that their maid/cleaner is no longer present.\n\nand that neighbors that do not like guests in their home, felt so bad for you then stepped over their dislike as they did - that says a LOT. (About them - being good people - and about your parents - not good people to you)", "YTA Genuinely surprised by the responses here. Your sister was ill enough to be in hospital and you wanted more attention at that exact moment? Your parents are right to prioritise her when she's that bad and 16 is old enough to be left by yourself for that amount of time. You said when she was out of danger things returned to normal. Great thier priorities sound good to me.\n\nUnless there was a reason that the latest appointment had to be during your game then your Mum shouldn't have made it, however there might be so I don't want to make a judgement on that and I'm saying this as a carer myself. It sucks but it's not usually the patient or carer's fault. Talk to your parents but don't hate on them or your sister for this situation. If your mum can't leave your sister then why not have your GF meet them both? It's not that hard. Without further info on your sisters condition or needs YTA or ESH at most.", "NTA. \nNaturally your sisters complex health needs are going to come first however you have 2 parents. There is no reason one can't be with her and the other be with you. \n\nYour request for your parents to meet your girlfriend or attend at least one of your volleyball games really is a basic request. \n\nAs soon as you can leave the family home. I just hope all this doesn't result in your resenting your sister, if it hasn't already.", "I'm not sure that's entirely fair. I think if you have a child who is seriously ill then naturally dealing with that issue gets higher priority than watching your healthy child play sport. It doesn't mean you care for the healthy child less. \n\nThe squeaky wheel gets the grease etc. \n\nI think it is fair to say that she doesn't care about ' sport and she should at least pretend to especially if this appointment can be rescheduled. \n\nMum could have handled this better.", "There are also two parents. One could be with the sister and the other with the OP. And they need to stop expecting the OP to do all the household chores if they have to go away with the sister (and have the courtesy to wake them up and let them know if they have to leave suddenly in the night.", "This is the most insightful comment for me and I wanted to say the same.", "Leaving a 16 year old home alone for a week to just fend for themselves when the parents could swap who is with the sister is pretty neglectful. OP just doesn\u2019t stop existing if sister is in the hospital. \n\nEspecially when it\u2019s \u201cback in ER, you have to clean the house\u201d.", "OP gave examples. Fairly sure it wasn't \"one time\".", "OP did only give explicit details of that one week within the character limits of the post. God, if only we could infer other things from everything else that was said, but tragically this is reddit, and so we have no critical reading skills. /s", "I never said it was a one incident, but apparently it was one (three) of the worst ones, if OP chose it. So the only expectation op had was to clean sometimes. Boohoo. At 16, it's surprising that it didn't happen earlier.", "But you can't predict the future. You might be able to put equal effort into both children AND THEN one of them gets disabled in a car accident or gets cancer etc. You also don't know how you or your partner or your other child will react if that happens. You can hypothesise but you won't know until it happens. \n\nUnless your saying that all children should be only children.", "You NTA, your sister NTA. But your parents need to learn to delegate their time appropriately. This is a sure-fire way to ensure you go NC with all of them by the time you are independent of them.", "If you can join forums for other Glass children You might find some people going through similar things. Glass children refers to the siblings of chronically ill or disabled children who are often overlooked.", "NTA at all, if you were raised by single parent then sure that would look bad but you had both of your parents why couldn't one of them take you to your games or be with you?\n\nThey are parents of 2 children but they acted as if they had one kid and one maid. \n\nThese people are not worth the time and effort OP, just move on and focus on the good things in your life.", "The parents have also not done more than the bare minimum for OP. Actually, they sometimes did less. They left a minor child alone at home for several days without notice. One parent could have at least checked in on OP regularly.", "Just dropped the parents.\n\nYou don\u2019t need them. At the end of the day, just because one of children is sick, that doesn\u2019t mean your other children stop existing. They still need love, care, compassion. Your parents fail to see that. You are not being entitled. It\u2019s them being neglectful to their other children.\n\nI personally would just stop trying with them. They will realize it one day, but it will be too late."]}
