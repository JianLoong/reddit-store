I won't say the name of the condition because not a lot of people have it. Anyway, she got diagnosed when she was 9, and when I was 16. It didn't really affect me at first. That is until her first surgery. It was understandable that my mom and dad were worried, and were always at the hospital. I was always left at home alone with the responsibility to cook, clean, do responsibility, with no one else there to help. One week of this was enough. My sister was discharged and everything went back to normal for 6 months.\n\n6 months later, at 3am, my parents and sister left to go to the hospital and left me this note:\n\n\"Hi, \n\nYour sister had a relaspe, we are at the hosptial. You can either walk or get a ride to your volleyball game today.\n\nLove, \n\nMom and Dad\"\n\nI was hurt, because this was the biggest game of the season, and no one was there to watch me, but I understood that health came first. We won the game, and my neighbors felt so bad for me they had me over for dinner. They hate having people over. A few days later my sister got discharged. \n\n2 months later, she had to be rushed to the ER because of an emergency, and my parents told me they wanted the house clean by the time they got home. I obeyed and they were pleased. \n\nFast forward to now, (2 years later), I got drafted to one of the biggest volleyball teams in my area, and I wanted my family to see me play at the Championship game. My mom said no, and that my sister had an appointment that day. She made the appointment yesterday, when she's known about my game for months. She's also been putting off meeting my girlfriend, saying that she needs to be available if my sister needs anything. \n\nToday I finally snapped. I said how ever since I was 16 I've been pushed to the side, bullied, and ignored. The least you could do is have dinner with me and my girlfriend or come see me play volleyball for once. She said I was being an entitled brat, and she told me not to call her until I fix my attitude. \n\nI just wanted to feel good about myself for once.

Many parents get stuck in these unfortunate situations but they need to learn that they don't just have one kid that needs them.", "NTA\n\nMy son has had 3 surgeries. Tons of appointments. I have 2 other children. If you had asked them when they were younger who my favorite was they would each say 'me'. They all grew up thinking they were the favorite. If you asked them now, they'd say the middle child, not because he has a heart problem, but because we go to the movies all the time. We both like scary movies and the other 2 don't. They aren't mad about it though. They know it's just silly and they're each important to me. \n\nIf I were you, I'd not call your mom. See how long it takes her to reach out. Stop playing their game. Stop begging them to love you. If anyone asks you what's going on, be completely honest. Your mom wants to rug sweep this so she doesn't look bad. She needs to look bad. Everyone in the family should know what you've been going through so in the future when your parents are begging you for money or care support because they're old, everyone will already know why you told them to fuck off and go ask their Golden Child.", "NTA. I'm sorry that you were neglected as it so often happens when one sibling is sick. But it doesn't excuse what your parents did to you. Your mom just blatantly ignored how you are feeling and she's as asshole for that. She will refuse to face her own actions that caused you feel like this. Take care of yourself and good luck on your tournament!

What you asked for isn't too unreasonable.  I hope you get it worked out with her OP, good luck.", "NTA-Some things are beyond your control and your sister's illness and your parents devotion to her are things you cannot change.  Is it unfair you're constantly overlooked and given responsibilities that are overwhelming?  Absolutely yes.  You have to look at what you do have control over and that is your reaction to things.  Your mom and dad are always going to put you second fiddle to your sister's illness.  That is unfortunate because it is like they forgot you are their child too.  You're not the housekeeper or the leftover kid, but you have been slapped with that title.  I hope your championship game is triumphant for you and I hope it continues to open doors to opportunities for you.  At this point, as hard as it is, do not worry about your parents showing up or not.  You worry about doing your best and excelling in a sport you obsviously love.  When you are able, get out of that house and live your best life.  Make yourself your priority and let them be second fiddle to your success.  You can ask someone to video your game and give it to them to watch later, but celebrate your victories with your gf.

Maybe the delivery wasn't the best, but I'm so tired of having to coddle my abuser when calling them out for their abuse, so frustrating.\n\nA blanket accusation is easy for the abuser to say how disrespectful you're being, gotta give it something to soften the blow or reiterate that \"yes, this is unpleasant to say, not my fault that I have to say it\".   \n\nFor example: \"I've been pushed to the side, bullied, ignored\" is a naked accusation whereas the following is paired with a consequence/solution: \"When I'm consistently pushed to the side, bullied, and ignored, I am being conditioned to participate in this family in a significantly reduced capacity.  You should either reduce your expectations of my role and of our relationship accordingly or work on repairing the respect that has been damaged.\"", "NTA.

Find a support network elsewhere.", "NTA. I've said it once and I'll say it again. A child with a condition does required extra care at times but that doesn't mean the world revolves around them.

Not expect the other kid(s) to suck it up because they're healthy and a sibling isn't.", "You were not and are not an AH.

It\u2019s clear you\u2019re being parentified.\n\n\u201cParentification is when parents rely on their children to give to them. (Family therapy founder Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy coined this term.) There are two types of parentification: Instrumental parentification. For example, the child takes care of siblings, runs the home, and is responsible for paying the bills.\u201d\n\nIt is a form of invisible childhood trauma and many who have gone through this will relate to the statement \u201cI was forced to grow up too soon.\u201d \nThat is why it\u2019s so traumatic because it is the loss of a childhood.

Mom and Dad have to be focused on the welfare of your  sister but it's not unreasonable to expect them to care about what's happening in your life, too. There may have been a reason for the last minute appointment. If there was, your mom should have shared that with you. This has happened to me when I've called the doc and there are only appointments weeks away but they had a cancellation for that afternoon and can I make it? You take what you can get.  Mom is probably burnt out trying to deal with all the medical stuff but that doesn't make things easier for you. I'm really sorry you're having this experience. Support is so important. Yes, I think your parents should make time for the important moments in your life. They're really missing out on building memories with you.", "ESH. Y-T-A for being mad your parents couldn\u2019t go to a sports game when YOUR SISTER WAS IN THE **HOSPITAL.***\n\nSome medical appointments just can\u2019t wait. Maybe this could.

Speaking from personal experiences they probably only used the house to sleep and occasionally grab a snack. Also you're 16. That's completely fine to have chores and be left alone in an *emergency*.\n\n>I was hurt, because this was the biggest game of the season, and no one was there to watch me, but I understood that health came first.\n\nYeah it does suck that they couldn't make it but again literal emergency that even if you say you understand it, you're throwing it in their faces to hurt them.\n\n>2 months later, she had to be rushed to the ER because of an emergency, and my parents told me they wanted the house clean by the time they got home.\n\nOkay the commanding tone is slightly weird but asking their 16 year old to clean the house, even without the emergency is pretty straight forward chores. Heck I voluntarily did it when my mom was rushed to the ER in high school.\n\n>Fast forward to now, (2 years later)\n\nSo there's only been 3 incidents before this in 2 years? \n\n>My mom said no, and that my sister had an appointment that day.\n\nSo she and your sister can't go. Nothing is said about your dad not being able to go and while she may have just made an appointment specialists are a pain to schedule and it could have been the only day they were available on short notice. \n\n>She's also been putting off meeting my girlfriend, saying that she needs to be available if my sister needs anything.\n\nYeah that I can't gage. Depending on the condition your sister could need round the clock awareness or maybe not. \n\n>Today I finally snapped. I said how ever since I was 16 I've been pushed to the side, bullied, and ignored. The least you could do is have dinner with me and my girlfriend or come see me play volleyball for once.\n\nHA! This was not bullying. So far you have been \"pushed aside\" 3 times, 2 of which were entirely unpredictable emergency visits and one was a major surgery, and have not indicated that it has impacted your daily life or that your weekly responsibilities have been changed. I also don't buy that ignored business either for the same reason. \n\n>She said I was being an entitled brat, and she told me not to call her until I fix my attitude.\n\nIf there have only been 3 (now 4) incidents in 2 years then you really are callous. And no none of this is parentification. See the definitions here ([https://www.healthline.com/health/parentification#instrumental-vs-emotional](https://www.healthline.com/health/parentification#instrumental-vs-emotional)). Your parents and sister would much rather go to all of your games than deal with this but that is just not the hand you were dealt and I understand better than you may think and I am very sorry for what all of you are going through. I know you are under stress from the game and probably post-high school stuff looming and normal teen life but lashing out at them is cruel and won't make you feel good. If available you should ask your school for mental health supports such as guidance councillors or therapists to help. I wish you all the best and good luck at the game!", "NTA\n\nIs the game over?

Yes, one child may need extra attention but these parents have a duty to try as hard as they can to give some attention to the other child.  They failed OP.  They may not think so now, but in a few years, after OP has given up on them and cut contact and no longer wants a relationship, they will start whining about \u201cdoing the best they could\u201d.  Well, no, they didn\u2019t do the best they could and they will have to live with that.  Somehow I don\u2019t think these parents are going to lose much sleep over it."]}
