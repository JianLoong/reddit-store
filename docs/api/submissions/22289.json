It\u2019s important to back yourself, but it takes some learning where that line is and a lot of people overcorrect. It happens.\n\nJust remember that asserting yourself is more effective when you can justify your approach.

But not by much. \n\nThen when she reached out to you she made the assumption that you had just waited for her instead of making other plans (and seeing as you were drunk I do hope you had made plans with other people and weren\u2019t just drunk on your own). You then told her straight up that you weren\u2019t available and weren\u2019t interested in being a back up. \n\nYou were not even slightly more rude than she was. You weren\u2019t more blunt than she was either - she straight up told you that she didn\u2019t have plans but was hoping someone else would invite her out! \n\nPlans should be first come, first serve, unless something once-in-a-lifetime happens (like say someone scored some last minute rare concert tickets and invited a friend - Id say in that instance it\u2019s ok to cancel more replannable hangouts as long as people communicate) or an emergency. \n\nShe\u2019s a shitty friend, and you\u2019re right - you do deserve to not be a back up friend.", "You: Hey friend, ya wanna hang out?\n\nHer: Not my first choice. I'm gonna wait and see if I'm good enough to be invited elsewhere.\n\nHer Later: They ditched me. You're better than nothing though.\n\nYou: I don't like that you told me to my face I'm not enough of a friend to spend time with until every other option is gone.\n\nHer: How Dare You be as honest with me as I was with you!!! You should be grateful I deign to hang out with you at all!\n\nNTA. Dude, she's not a friend.

It would have been different if she already had possible plans pending but she quite literally told you that she wanted to wait to see if other friends might want to possibly do something first. She did have you as a backup friend. It's not like she said \"so and so and I are maybe going to do x tonight so I'll let you know\". There weren't any plans made, you were a little drunkyface and feeling bad in the moment. I don't think it was \"too blunt\". It was just as blunt as her saying she wanted to wait to see if anybody else wanted to hangout first before she would make plans with you.", "NTA. That was a perfectly normal boundary to have and I do hope that she eventually learns from this. With what you've written, I don't even think your response was too blunt.\n\nIs she purposely keeping you from her other groups of friends? Because there's definitely times when I'm trying to hang out with group ABC, but friend D messages me, so I just tell them something like \"hey, I'd love to hang out! I'm in the middle of making plans with ABC that day, so did you have anything particular in mind? If not, wanna tag along with plans with ABC if we end up planning something, or do you wanna hangout a different day?\"", "I\u2019m assuming the girl is somewhat cute. \n\nUnfortunately cute girls are not used to being told either the word No or the truth!  \n\nNTA!

The time to deal with this was when you first asked and she basically said she was available unless she got a better offer.   You can just say \u201cok, no worries.  Maybe next time\u201d and then let her be the one to reach out to you next.  It\u2019s one thing for her to say \u201coh, I may be doing something with person X, can I get back to you when I know for sure?\u201d, but she pretty much wanted to keep you standby to see if anything better came along.  Respect yourself enough to not have people like that in your life.", "Time to cut her off. She is a shitty friend. You are clearly 2nd class friend to her. NTA", "NTA. She literally told you she could hang out with you if she didn\u2019t get a call from the friends she\u2019d prefer to hang out with. It also sounds like she honestly didn\u2019t know she was being an A-hole. You told her very directly. She was shocked and hopefully that\u2019ll make her reflect on how rude she was being.", "NTA.

I cut ties (not in a formal way, just let the friendship fade) with someone who did this.

And then she'd make up stuff like, \"My husband surprised me and we're going to visit so-and-so.\" or \"I have to cancel because they just showed up.\" (and meanwhile, they called her a day ahead before making the 5 hour drive). I got fed up with being her backup holiday plan so I called it quits on our relationship. \n\nYou're better than second place.", "She basically told you how she felt about you, she made you her last opinion, the if no one else asked me to hangout I might as well hangout with you opinion.

Then they slipped one day and said \"I don't know that sounds fun, I'll have to see if anybody else wants to do something.\" And It just flipped a switch. I told him that that's what I was trying to do, make plans to do stuff and he just didn't understand what I meant and I realized I was a backup.

Maybe it was near that other friends birthday or someone who they have not seen in a while might be available. \n\nIt could be worth explaining your feelings, but that you spoke harshly due to the drinks. If she understands your perspective she might break out an apology and explanation as well.", "nta at all", "You were spot on in your assessment and the language you used was fine.", "NTA.

Make the effort to come up with it yourself.\n\nSomeone has to be the one to come up with those \"interesting\" somethings.

If you're interested in dating her, then I'd recommend diverting your resources elsewhere.", "NTA", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t bother with her anymore", "You're 100% the backup friend, if you can even call this friendship. Don't feel bad u said it, feel bad u didn't say it sooner.", "NTA. Real friends give you an answer without waiting on other friends. Honestly, I wouldn't bother to invite her anywhere ever again. She doesn't respect you or your time, and you deserve better.", "I had a friend cancel our plans because she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be in the area that day\u201d \ud83e\udd2f", "Tbh, NTA in your reasoning or in being blunt. Blunt in this i stance seems to mean saying what you actually think", "NTA. She got some valuable feedback there.", "NTA. Good for you.", "Drop this friend", "NTA\n\nYou weren't too blunt. You probably should have said it to her a while ago.", "NTA", "This is a way people test you to see what they can get away with. If you allow it they will never respect you wether it is platonic or romantic. Your reply should follow this format: \u201cno worries, if you\u2019re not sure about your schedule let\u2019s just try again another time.\u201d \n\nBut YOU don\u2019t propose another date on the spot. If she proposes one, great you can proceed. If she doesn\u2019t, you can try again in a week or two if you like. If she hits you with the maybe again, forget about her and move on.", "Let me give you an award for your bluntness. You sir, are my hero. Please cherish this soon to be removed award and please carry on. Some people just need that brutally honest truth sometimes", "NTA. You are the last resort hang. Get some self-respect and lose her number.", "NTA. She was definitely waiting for a chance to hang out with other people first. F that.", "NTA at all. There\u2019s nothing wrong with bluntness sometimes. \n\nAlso, wait until she gets married, ghosts you for the length of her marriage, and when her husband leaves her, pops back into your life and makes you feel like an AH when you won\u2019t spend every waking moment with her. \n\nNot that that happened to me, of course.", "NTA. I had to do that to a girlfriend once (now ex of course). We were long distance and I was planning to come live with her for 6 months and she's like 'I met this guy and I want to see if it works out with him, but if it doesn't you can still come over' and I'm like... I'm not your fucking backup plan, and broke up with her.\n\nNow I'd just suggest being poly lol, but it didn't work out for a whole bunch of reasons beyond that - that was just the straw which broke the camel's bank.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI once had a friend who would only respond to my messages if she didn't have anything else to do. She would literally leave me on read for hours to days, sometimes even weeks, and then later respond as if nothing happened. She never once apologized and only made bullshit excuses. Blocked her and moved on.\n\nLife's too short to be with the wrong people.", "NTA for what you said, NTA for how you feel and NTA for being blunt. \n\nAlso you weren't being blunt you were being honest. If she didn't feel good about what she was told then she shouldn't have made you feel this way in the first place.", "NTA. No you called it, you are her pack of instant noodles that she keeps just in case nothing else is on offer.", "NTA. Well said, perfectly blunt.", "I\u2019m 70 I have friends from the 70\u2019s I still see,  you are NTA blunt truthful yes but she\u2019s just a \u201cfair weather\u201d friend she\u2019ll hang out as long as something better doesn\u2019t come along.", "NTA I had a friend like this. She finally ignored me after she was tired of being my friend years ago. Hurts more than a break up... OP should move on", "Woulda done the same thing. Have done the same thing. She doesn\u2019t seem like a good friend", "Yes be strong like ox and say no", "NTA for any of it.", "No, he handled with exactly the right amount of tact deserved.", "Exactly. If you had said this, when you were sober, in the first conversation, \u201cif you\u2019re not sure you have time, I\u2019ll make other plans for tomorrow, and we can arrange to meet up another time\u201c, she would\u2019ve known right away that  you aren\u2019t willing to be the back up hang, you wouldn\u2019t be doubting yourself now. Just do it straight upfront next time.", "Yeah. Never said she didn't. But you do better in life being blunt upfront when you need to be than never being blunt till it's emotional blowup time."]}
