It is your friend and that is how you felt.", "You called her out. She didn\u2019t like it. She lashes out. \n\nDon\u2019t call her again. She\u2019s wasting your time.

It's a totally shitty thing to do to say \"I don't have plans, but I want to see if my other friends invite me to anything before I agree to hang out with you.\"\n\nThat's fucked up.", "NTA. You were direct but not rude or unnecessarily harsh. She prioritized hanging out with other friends over you, which is her prerogative, but she can\u2019t then assume she has you in retainer when her preferred social activity doesn\u2019t materialize.", "NTA, but if she waiting til 30 minutes before, she also sounds like the backup plan for *her* friends.", "No need to be this blunt, a better method might be \"I do not wish for me to be put at last priority and only used as a backup plan\" (still very blunt, I know)\n\nNTA", "NTA. Never be the backup plan. Have standards.", "NTA but you have to learn how to say that when sober, i dont want you to feel like you can only be honest and say how you feel when youre drunk. You shouldnt be the backup plan.", "NTA but also, you were too blunt.  It's not right to leave someone as the backup plan and/or to leave plans like that because she wants to hang out with someone else instead. Also.... there's a way to say something like that constructively that could resolve the issue.  instead you basically cussed her out while you were drunk.  that being said, if she really doesn't get why you were upset, maybe time for a non-backup friend.", "NTA - don't give any time to people who treat you as a plan B", "NTA at all you need to have boundaries and keep your self respect", "NTA - she made it clear she is only interested in being your friend when she has no other options.

Maybe not consciously but a back-up nonetheless...you're just now figuring that out.

You clearly and bluntly told your feelings.", "Nope. I'd tell her to lose my number.", "NTA.  People do tend to prioritize their friends.  It would be one thing if your friend was waiting to hear from other friends about something she thought they might have planned, but to put you on hold just in case they might call her.  You occupy a lower rung on the ladder of importance in her life, it appears.  You don't want to overreact to a single incident, but I am guessing this was not an isolated instance if you went so far as to post here.  No one wants to be a backup plan.", "INFO: is this a day she normally hangs out with friends? Perhaps it's a day that she had set aside for friends and that was the reason why she responded in that manner? \n\nIf the answer is she did NAH.

The only way I'm ok with being the backup friend is if there's a concert ticket involved", "NTA - keeping someone on hold in the hopes you get a better offer is awful. That person is not your friend.", "NTA. You were not wrong for feeling a way, nor too blunt. You have every right to feel this way and handle it the way you did. I was told something like this by a homeboy once and i took it as we werent actual friends. Now, maybe you or others are okay with not being thought of as the same as a persons other friends, but i actually think its a little rude for HER to be this blunt.

If she didn't have pending plans, she's sending a pretty clear message that she would prefer them, yet somehow without you? If she was with you she would fear missing out on them? It's her right to choose between friends, and leave you at the last minute to make different plans or have no plans?\n\nIt hurts, but just move on if she doesn't understand why she was rude. Her friendship, at this point, doesn't sound like it has too much value. There are other, better friendships out there!", "NTA. But you were wrong, you weren't being an asshole for being blunt. She's a bad 'friend'.\n\nIf you call up and say hey a few of us are going bowling do you want to come and she already has plans but they might fall through that's one thing. But if she has no plans, can simply say yes lets hang out but decides to wait till the last second to see if anyone at all has something going on, she's an asshole.", "NTA. You aren't a backup friend -- and she was just upset she got called out so she deflected it back to you to make you feel guilty.\n\nYou rightly called her out and she now knows she can't get away with that as easily. Just means if you forgive her she's gonna figure out something else.\n\nI'd ditch her, myself.

She wanted to see if she had any better offers.", "Your drunk self has a shiny spine. But it is the truth. I make plans with who asked me first. Everyone else I\u2019ll reschedule with.

You deserve better than being treated as a spare tire.", "NTA.\n\nI had a friend like this, and it\u2019s so disrespectful. If you already have plans that\u2019s one thing, but it\u2019s beyond rude to wait around in the hopes that somebody \u201cbetter\u201d will ask you to hang out, and then go to your other friend as a second choice and ask them to hang out when your first choice didn\u2019t hit you up.

You can do better than being a back up plan.", "YTA because you ARE a backup friend, whether you like it or not.\n\nYou said so yourself, you are basically aquaintances. You messaged her while drunk and got butthurt. Too bad!\n\nI also had a friend (actual friend) who was always worried about his friendship ranking all the time, he was exhausting to be around.

It\u2019s the context and the situation that matters.\n\nIt seems based on your comments as if you take pride in telling people how you feel, when you feel it. A lot of people seem to make this a core part of their identity and personality. I would just be cautious that saying things like this gives an immediate impression to people, and it won\u2019t always be a good one. Foregoing tact in favour of brutal honesty when brutal honesty is not necessary is not a personality, it\u2019s just rudeness.\n\nYour behaviour toward others should be based on what is appropriate in the situation, not the sort of person you perceive yourself to be. Because ultimately, the person people perceive you to be isn\u2019t based on who you tell them you are, it\u2019s based on how you act.", "Yuck", "I will admit that I have lost a lot of filter after years of not expressing my feelings and going along with what everyone else wanted. Thank you for not being insulting. Your comment is very well thought out and has given me food for thought.", "Honestly it happens a lot with people who have spent their lives silencing themselves to please others. It\u2019s important to back yourself, but it takes some learning where that line is and a lot of people overcorrect. It happens.\n\nJust remember that asserting yourself is more effective when you can justify your approach. If you speak your mind more harshly than necessary, people aren\u2019t going to focus on the fact that you\u2019re right or your perspective, they\u2019re just going to focus on your delivery."]}
