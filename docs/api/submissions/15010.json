It's common practice to name kids after family members and always has been. We have 3 Williams and a Lliam in my family, and they're all very closely related.", "Eh. It wasn't awkward for me. My aunt and i share a name and no one thought twice of it except strangers. Made it doubly weird because growing up i looked very much like her so a lot of people were slightly like: and she's your AUNT?!", "An excellent nickname, though! :)", "OP: This isn't the name you are upset about\n\nWe can go about our busines\n\nMove along\n\nSIL: move along, move along", "The last and best Hope \ud83e\udd2d", "r/unexpectedstarwars", "Yes. Lots of people are commenting that there are 3 Bill's in their family but it's a bit different when it's your name or your siblings.\n\nIt'd be pretty odd of me to have a kid and give it the same name as my brother. Especially since he's still young enough to live with my parents. Everytime they say the name of course they're going to think of their son first instead of their grandson. I don't think my brother would be too pleased. But if I named a baby after our grandfather then its diffrent, because it's more distant.\n\nI also do think it's a bit wierd that OP's bf was fine with naming the baby the same name as his sister when they don't get along. Why bring that extra tension into your lives.", "Nothing sours a name like meeting an asshole who has it though.", "This isn't a stolen baby name.  This is a baby name that 1) hasn't been used in the family for more than two decades; and 2) was intended before the sister in law was even in the picture.", "Stolen as in using the same name as a sibling in the same line is kind of weird. The fact that she wanted to name her baby Hope before she ever met this family means it isn\u2019t stolen, its just a coincidence which makes it different. \n\nI was named \u201cKate Elizabeth\u201d and a year later my Dads brother named his daughter \u201cKailey Beth\u201d. My Grandmother thought that was \u201cstealing\u201d it because she wasn\u2019t named after any family and her name was picked after they liked mine, which is a whole different scenario.", "OP says multiple times that he liked the name too not that it was his top choice...", "Thank you for explaining this \ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m not judging, I just have multiple kids and know I need to call their name a lot so I wondered how they differentiated. But I guess it\u2019s good because he doesn\u2019t mix up anyone\u2019s name!", "How is it different than a junior being named after their parent? That\u2019s why people use their SSN so it doesn\u2019t rely on the name that could easily be the same. I have a very common last name and pretty common first, there\u2019s millions of people out there with the same name as me and it doesn\u2019t affect me", "The baby is atleast 20 odd years younger than the og Hope. Credit lines will not be crossed.", "I know, that's why I like to poke fun at it;) Because it's amazing the amount of people who are *not* aware it's not like this everywhere and just accept it as normal.", "I come from an Irish family, half of us are named John", "My dad and brother were both Steve. Now my BIL is Tim, his oldest nephew is Tim, my boyfriend is Tim. Then in my boyfriend's family he also has a BIL Tim. And an uncle named Tim. \n\nHaving the same name can be common, depending on the name. SIL needs to chill, she didn't trademark the name.", "Yes but It is kind of annoying when you have to figure out which one your talking about, especially when it's not a family name to begin with.\n\n There are loads of John's in my family, but it was my grandads name (and probably his grandad), it's not a huge deal, and It shouldn't necessarily put you off choosing the name, but I can see how youd be put out.", "My cousins have three uncle David\u2019s: my dad, their moms brother, their dads brother.", "Fr. My grandfather, uncle, and oldest two cousins were all Robert. No one ever thought it was weird.", "I have two uncle Bills, and my cousins had two uncle Garys.   My older half sister is named Terri and our father is Terry.  We didn't think anything of it.", "It's like a fun game, yell out Bob and see which one replies haha.", "My mom's francophone family had literally 6 generations of men named Jean-Baptiste. Her uncles son is a jr but they called him \"wee *name*\". Like 3 aunties had the same names. We referred to them by their last names to specify.  My dad's English side of the family, everyone is named John or something.", "Well yeah, with a middle name it doesn't really make a difference if they're the same. Most middle names are family. But I'm not going to get mixed up with my aunt just because her first name is my middle name.", "it used to worry me because my sisters and i don\u2019t have similar names and my mom still gets us mixed up\ud83d\ude02i guess they have their own system for it", "This happened to my friend and his dad (who was definitely more than 20 years older than him). Fortunately my friend benefited from the older Charles\u2019 good credit.", "It doesn't even happen in the US that often, people like to blow that out of proportion. Those people with the same name don't have the same social security numbers so it's very unlikely to get financial stuff mixed up with wrong person.", "The amount of Michael\u2019s, Jim\u2019s, Sarah\u2019s and John\u2019s  in my family is astonishing. Two of the Michael\u2019s are my uncles on different sides. It\u2019s easy to say \u201cuncle Mike on mom\u2019s side\u201d to alleviate potential confusion. I also share the same middle name with about half my cousins (I have over 20 lol). It\u2019s crazy how some people think stuff like this is a huge deal.", "Lol see my below comment. I'm Irish too and half my family have the same name. It can get confusing. And you can still call your kid that if you want. \n\nI just think it's silly that all the comments are talking as if Sil wanted the name for her own baby or something. It's going to directly impact her I imagine. She does have a right to be annoyed, even if OP has the right to use the name.", "Half my step family is named James, they all have nicknames and it doesn't matter at all", "My roommates family is Irish-Italian; half of them are a John or a Daniel. It\u2019s actually pretty dang common for names to be shared in families.", "I have 6 cousins John! And they\u2019re all even John Joseph! This sub is so strange about this issue. It\u2019s not an abnormal thing!", "7 Johns over here! 7 Johns, 2 Mikes, and at one point 2 Marys.", "Grandpa dad brother named the same, no issues lol", "My dad's side of the family has my great grandfather John, my grandfather John who goes by his middle name, my father whose middle name is John and me whose dead name is John so there's 4 generations of John and nobody living who actually uses the name.", "You're wrong. There's nothing weird about it and no one owns a name. Only a very self centred person would have a problem with someone else having \"their\" name.", "It's fairly common, especially in families where one of a previous generation was a big influence.", "My parents both had only one sibling with the same name. So one was nicknamed the other wasn't think aunty Bec and aunty Rebecca (not actual names). When my dad's sister passed away, we didn't swap to Rebecca for mum's sister it stayed Bec. She passed 17 years ago and it has never changed, and we actively correct ourselves still when we say the full name", "Everyone has an uncle Mike", "It seems SIL didn't provide much reason she didn't want the name used, I'm guessing she just doesn't like it and therefore doesn't want her niece to go through whatever struggles with the name she had... but she didn't seem to give a reason, or OP didn't share what the reason was.\n\nEither way, SIL doesn't get to choose the name of someone else's baby.", "People can have different opinions.", "Just to be clear, I don't think naming after a grand parent is weird, I think choosing the same name as a sibling is weird.", "No of course not, at the end of the day OP can name their baby whatever they want.\n\nI just don't think Sil is ridiculous for being upset about it.", "It literally doesn't fit the definition of the word weird.", "Opinions can also be wrong, for what its worth.", "I think SIL is allowed to be annoyed, but if she didn't give a proper explanation why she doesn't like the name then she doesn't have much of a leg to stand on.", "I think it would be weird if I give my daughter the same name as my sister.", "Because it would be weird for you doesn't mean it's weird in OP's situation"]}
