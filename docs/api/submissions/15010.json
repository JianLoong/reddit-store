She was the sweetest woman and I have always said I\u2019d name my first daughter after her in her memory.\n\nWell as it turns out, my boyfriend has a younger sister called Hope, she\u2019s 26 and doesn\u2019t really have the best relationship with her brother. They speak on occasions, but just each get on with their own lives, so we hardly have contact with her, besides at family gatherings.\n\nI told my boyfriend I planned on using the name for our daughter, way before we even found out I was pregnant, he agreed and was fine with it. However, when we found out we were expecting a baby girl, he said we should at least tell his sister that\u2019s the name we have chosen.\n\nI agreed and we arranged to go out for lunch together, there I told her about how I\u2019ve always wanted to use her name, and the baby wouldn\u2019t be named after her as such, but they would share a name as it is important to me. \n\nHis sister was not happy about it and said she didn\u2019t like the idea of her niece sharing the same name as her and asked us please not to use it. I explained I wasn\u2019t really asking permission, I was more informing her of our choice.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t very happy about it, but this was months ago and my boyfriend and I assumed she would be over it by now. Anyway, 2 weeks ago when my daughter was born, bf posted in his family group chat a photo of her and her name, Hope.\n\nHis sister called me and first said congratulations, but she didn\u2019t understand why we used that name when she specifically asked us not to.\n\nI said that it\u2019s going on her birth certificate if she likes it or not as she couldn\u2019t even give me a reason not to use her name, whereas I could give her reasons why I wanted to.\n\n\nShe called my boyfriend and I assholes and said this will only impact her relationship with her brother even more.\n\nBut honestly, I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with using the name.

You name your child whatever you want.", "NTA. I can understand not wanting to share a name with a new baby in the family, but she didn't have veto rights and you did not lead her to believe she did.\n\nI think assuming she got over it was overly optimistic. But I don't think you owed it to her to have repeated conversations with someone you don't often see about her dissatisfaction with a decision you are not open to changing.\n\nAnd Hope is a beautiful name.", "NTA, sounds win-win.

I ended up naming my daughter the same name as a cat we had growing up. I didn\u2019t name her after the cat.

I\u2019m glad I went with it.", "NTA and marriages are 50/50 on making it you'll regret it after/if they divorce. You're naming it for your GRANDMOTHER not anyone else. My nieces both have Arla their name. One as first one as middle in remembrance to their great-grandmother. No one owns a name.

While you can pick any name you like this is a great example of why naming hypothetical babies is different to naming real life babies. Did you never consider, I don\u2019t know, deciding a name you both love? Because thinking only of yourself isn\u2019t a great first parenting choice", "NTA.  Does she expect the world to come up with 8 billion unique names?  Your daughter is named after your great grandma, not BF\u2019s sister", "I have an Aunt that named her daughter after her sister. It's my Grandma so my grandma's sister has a daughter with the same name. But my grandma was super happy and honored to have the same name. It's sweet.

I'm sorry his sister is upset, but you did nothing wrong. You and your boyfriend chose a name for your child before you knew his sister's name was Hope, and you told her about your decision before the baby was born.

You literally did what you told everyone that you would do. Not really her choice.", "NTA. There are thousands of babies being named Hope. How can she claim ownership to the name? \nBesides, your baby is being named after your great grandma. Not after SIL.\n\nIt's a beautiful name.", "NTA.

Gatekeeping names is childish.", "NTA.  Hope is a wonderful name!  Congratulations on your new baby girl!  May she be much like her namesake, and nothing like her aunt.", "NTA is she upset when she meets strangers named Hope on the street? If someone close to be was naming their child Katy, my response would be \u2018excellent choice of name\u2019.", "NTA - but perhaps there could be some kind of compromise position  - in order to avoid any confusion by naming your child Hope (nice name by the way), you could encourage the rest of the family to start calling your SIL \u201cHopeless\u2026\u201d", "NTA but she sure sounds like one", "NTA.

She'll get over herself if she's smart.", "NTA, you have valid reasons and I think even informing the sister was above and beyond what is a reasonable naming.\n\nHope is a decently common name and the SIL doesn't have exclusive rights to it.

Listen I believe that there are only some times someone can act REALLY selfish and this is one of them and you are not even really selfish", "NTA You're naming your baby after someone precious to you.

Is he genuinely okay with it or just apathetic/doesn't want to argue?\n\n\nIn my culture, you never name after the living. So it's not super common to see the same name a lot in families. I know I'd feel really awkward with a niece with my name. And both my brothers have super common, long lasting names....I wouldn't give either name to a son, even if it was a very meaningful name to my husband.", "NTA.

I would just tell anyone that if she/others (her family) complain.", "he was totally okay with it!! if he wasn\u2019t, i would of had to compromise and possibly go for a middle name instead of her first name. Obviously if the father didn\u2019t want to use it, we would of course come up with something different, but I don\u2019t see why his sister, someone who he isn\u2019t even that close with anyway, should get an opinion. i firmly believe that naming a child should be between the mother and father and since he was absolutely fine with it, that\u2019s what we went for!", "Or \u201cBig Hope\u201d or \u201cOld Hope\u201d\u2026\n\nBet she will loooove that!
