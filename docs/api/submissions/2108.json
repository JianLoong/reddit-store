Emily and I never got along when our daughter was born, mainly because she always calls cps on me about child maintenance(support when we have shared custody). i was financially stable at 21 because i had won the loterry recently and invested  it in a successful business. On the other hand, Emily was from the USA and had to drop out of university for out baby which caused a lot of issues when raising our daughter. This is because she had a full time job to help raise her daughter meaning she was always busy. While I chose  to work at home on my buisness until my daughter was 4 (we both lived separately). Around this time i married another woman (katie) who I had twins with. Katie always loved my daughter as her own and never chose favourites between mine and hers. My daughter eventually began calling her mommy katie which infuriated Emily for no reason. Long story short it was recently my 10yrs old daughter birthday party, and when she blew out her candle she wished for a hug from her mom. She ran to katie. I was obvivously happy to see my daughter happy, though emily was in tears. She began shouting at both me and katie for spoiling our daughter to like us better. Then she began ranting on how horrible we are to treat her like this for 6yrs. I was about to kick her out before our daughter sreamed she hated Emily and that Katie was the best mother. This happened a 3 days ago and i haven't heard from her since. Her parents called me shouting for always treating their daughter like crap and nor finacially providing for her like a man. I told them to fuck off brfore I hung up. I don't think I did anything wron but i keep getting angry phone calls from her family members. katie says we didn't do anything wrong and it's her fault for being a horrible mother. My daughter is pretty much ok and is enjoying her presents. So AITA here or not.\n\nJust to clear a few ponits that everyone is commenting. I always disipline my daughter when she needs its and i teach her responsibility all the time. so I'm not the just the \"fun\" dad i'm a father who rewards her child when they listen and does great in school. Second point is that blood doesn't make family love does. I hated nearly everyone blood related to me but i was force to act like i love them. Never gonna happen with my kids. I can't force my daughter to love someone. if anything I'm proud that my daughter was able to scream what she said. i never had that courage as a child. Also my number one responsibility is to do what is best in my daughter life not mine.  \n\nBecause you all wanted to here things that make emily a horrible mother here it is.\nwhile my daughter is at  emily place she prefers to stay in her room most of the time but whenever emily has family over she forces my daughter to interact with them. If my daughter wants to stay in her room she should be allowed. that is her right. They have the aducity to make a few jokes about my daughter growing up in the \"posh\" area. My daughter hates these jokes but emily does nothing. My daughter usally refuses to eat with strangers but here is emily forcing her to do so never the less most food she makes is unhealthy. She also forces her to share her things ( that i dam bought her) with her cousins) especially her phone and tablet. Even some of her clothes. Emily keeps telling me she is teaching our daughter to share but my daughter hates to share just like i hated it too. Why should she  have to share her own stuff epecialy when emily didn't buy it for her. This is fucking disgusting. SO here is why i hate emily more than ever\n\nJust to make this clear me and my daughter of course are two different people but i'm one of the few adults who know her the best. I understand she hates to share and she tells me she hates to share with her mother side of the family. I buy her everything when she stays at her mothers because i thought that would solve the issue of sharing her mothers stuff. but no these people think touching my daughter property is ok because we are \"family\". I told them to stop with what i call abuse and have made my daughter to put locks and passowrds on everything. Emily exuse was she wanted to help bond her with her family. I even bought my daughter a sectret walkie talkie for an emergency incase anything happens. I can't deal with this woman so i need full custody of my child. My daughter has hobies like horse ridding and swimming sometimes but because of emily she has missed a few lessons. Emily told me it was better to spend time with the \"family\". instead my daughter doing her fucking hobby. I don't know how you can defend this woman. My daughter still hasn't even gone through her first period and i already know that is going to start another fuss on who is going to teach her to be clean or whatever. \n\n\nIT'S NOt MY RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PAY FOR SOMEONE else child EDUCATION THAT WAS HER PARENTS JOB NOT MINE. MY JOB IS TO PAY FOR MY CHILDREN EDUCATION WHICH I PAY BY MYSELF BY THE WAY. I   SEND all  MY KIDS TO PRIVATE SCHOOL and i'm the only one paying here.\n I DIDNT HELP HER FINACIALLY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TOO. I DON'T CARE If SHE IS THE  MOTHER OF MY CHILD I  DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TP PAY FOR \"HER NEEDs\" i only pay for my child needs\n\n\njust to make this clear. in england 50/50 custody means 50/50. so i legaly I don't have to pay child maintenance(support) not matter how much more one parents  earns.", "created_utc": 1668244949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt1zar/aita_for_allowing_my_daughter_to_call_my_wife_her/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After reading your post and then your comments to peoples info request you and your wife are ta here not emily. You constantly undermine her, you didnt support her while she was pregnant and you obviously dislike her for whatever reasons.  I think you encourage your daughter to be disrespectful of her mother and im pretty sure you talk crap about her mothers way of raising her to her or in her presence. You refuse to get her any therapy cause you didnt like therapy at her age etc. You want her to hate her mother as much as you do and that makes you the biggest ah.", "Giant YTA. \nThis child was seemingly born around the time of the lotto win. Pregnant or newly post partum, she had to give up her education and work when you theoretically could have easily supported the child on your own to let her get a degree to hopefully let her make something of herself since you were set. So now the child has a rich parent and a poor parent at war, when she may have had a shot at two successful parents who were friends. Did you intentionally want her to be less-than so you could always be superior for some reason? Even 10yrs on, I still dont see even one suggestion or desire here of supporting a good mother/daughter relationship. That is what a good coparent does: They unify and support family bonds. Yet here you are gleeful that your daughter dislikes her and now want full custody. Disturbing.", "YTA.  It sounds like you're having serious difficulty in separating what you want from what your daughter needs.  Nearly everything you've said reeks of projection.  I can clearly see how you are manipulating your daughter to achieve what **you** want - which appears to be to abuse your ex with impunity.\n\nI'm not at all surprised that you didn't want to attend therapy for your own good and I suspect you keep your daughter from therapy because you are afraid of what she might disclose about you.\n\nY most definitely TA.", "Nothing that OP has posted supports Katie's claims that Emily is a bad mother. \n\nBut what really concerns me is that a ten-year old child is so alienated from her birth mother that she makes her preferences for her step mother so very very clear. Typically, a child has been removed from her the birth parent's life (because of how toxic that relationship is) before such clear preferences are stated. \n\nThat OP seems to encourage this alienation from the birth mother adds a whole other layer of complexity here in that it makes me think that maybe, just maybe, OP has allowed his own personal history with the birth mother to contaminate how their daughter thinks of her birth mother.  \n\nThere's a whole lot of history to unravel. This is way more complicated than simply: \"my daughter blew up at her mom during her birthday party.\" \n\nI have no judgement to make; but I would strongly urge some family counseling for the adults on how to be better parents and some individual therapy for the 10 year old.", "YTA \n\nYou said in a comment \u201cI don\u2019t spoil my daughter so she loves me more, I spoil her so she can live the childhood I never had \u201c\n\nSo you are spoiling her and of course she is gonna love your house more compared to her poor mom. \n\n\nThen you going to say you don\u2019t want her to go to therapy because you hated therapy when you were young.

On the other hand, Emily was from the USA and had to drop out of university for out baby which caused a lot of issues when raising our daughter. This is because she had a full time job to help raise her daughter meaning she was always busy.\n\nOkay, to clarify one thing: You got Emily pregnant when you were both 21. You had *won the lottery* back then and were financially stable. You worked from home in your own business. But Emily had to drop out of university  and take on a full time job while raising your new born child/toddler, yes?\n\nWhy in the world did you not help her out financially? No matter if you got along or not, you impregnated this woman and then watched her sacrificing her career and becoming a struggling mom with too much on her plate?\n\nAnd then you encouraged your daughter being estranged from her because you and your wife are financially able to give her more opportunities and things...\n\nYour childs relationship to her bio mom is important and it would be your and your wifes responsibility to protect this relationship.\n\nI've read nothing here that suggests Emily is a bad mom. Having a 10 year old help in the house is normal and so is time out for bad behaviour. You really seem to spoil your daughter to make yourselves favourites.\n\nYeah, YTA.", "I'm sorry but YTA.\nYour daughter has a mother who, from everything you've said so far, loves her enough to give up her own dreams to give birth and raise her. \nYou sound like the 'fun' parent. You know, the one that spoils a kid and doesn't really discipline. \nPlease do not apply for full custody, you will be doing your daughter a huge disservice! She is 10, not 18, and does not fully understand the consequences of what you are suggesting. What if something happens to her mother because of this and she blames you and your wife? Can you with 100% certainty guarantee that your wife will always treat her the same as her bio kids? I hope so, but things don't always work that way.\nIn all truthfulness, your wife is NOT her mother.

But he still recognised that everyone is in a tricky situation because it\u2019s difficult balancing parenting, work, families with different priorities and making sure the kid in the middle of it all is happy, healthy and balanced. \n\n\nYou\u2019re not doing it right and you need to help your daughter in her relationship with her mum. When she becomes older, she can make a decision who she wants in her life. Not at 10.  You need to communicate with her sensitively about how she only has one mum and dad. You are both very important people in her life. Having a blended family means MORE people to show her love\u2026.not replacements. \n\n\nI know there will always be some scenarios where bio parents are out of a child\u2019s life for very real or good reasons, but \u201cwe didn\u2019t get on, I have more financial freedom and she had to work a lot\u201d is absolutely not one of those good reasons.", "I have been divorced for 12 years now.

Her mom seems to be a hardworking, caring mom. \n\nYTA imo. Both you and Emily are her parents. Its not a competition, there should be room enough for all of you adults in this girls life.", "YTA, (your wife is too) it sounds like you're manipulating your daughter in to behaving this way in order to build more divide between her and her biological mom.  especially reading some of these comments that you've replied to, such as wanting full custody and how you spoil her compared to her biological mom. \n\nYou may not think you are doing this on purpose, but I'm going to bet that you don't take positively about Emily in the home either directly or indirectly while your daughter is in the house and that is filling her head with negative ideas about her mom. Even talking about the differences in punishment, you're enforcing this idea that \"dad and mom spoil you and your biological mom doesn't, do you really want to spend time with someone that will make you do chores?\"  \n\nit's kind of fucked up that you are doing this to a 10 year-old.  I know from personal experience. I resent my mom for the things she said about my dad after they split and she did similar things to what you are doing now.", "i genuinely think this is a matter of you just running amuck being a dick for no reason. you didn't support emily whatsoever during her pregnancy, clearly she's upset by it. do you want her to just be happy with everything you throw her way?! there's nothing wrong with your daughter calling your wife \"mommy katie\" but you need to remember she isn't her mum.", "YTA. First why did you allow your daughter\u2019s mom to struggle and drop out of school when you could have helped? Why are you encouraging parental alienation? Of course you daughter loves new shiny things and the household that is more financially stable. Her mom is probably stressed and isn\u2019t able to be the fun parent. What you are doing isn\u2019t going to be good for your daughter in the long run. There is a huge possibility that she will figure out what you are doing and be resentful towards you when she gets older. \n\nWhat you are doing is potentially neglectful and manipulative. You could choose to coparent in a way that your daughter has 3 loving parents from 2 households but you are choosing conflict. Your daughter deserves better than this.", "Info: by shared, do you mean you both always had 50/50 custody?", "So you didn't pay maintenance and forced Emily to give up her study and career to make enough money to support herself and your daughter, and now you're using this against her. It sounds like you and new wife want to make Emily miserable. I really hope you read and take on board all the comments here, because none of your justifications hold up.

You have shared nothing to show her mother is anything but a struggling single women who loves her daughter. Of course she enjoys your home more, your rich, have a wife and more children and you don't make her work around the home. Your ex can't give her the life she thinks she wants, but she is to young to understand that the vaule her mother has to her is more than money and a easy life. She will understand that when she is a adult and she will blame you for ending her relationship with her bio-mum. \n\nYou are failing your daughter. Your wife is failing your daughter. And if you go to court, the judge will tell you that your failing your daughter. They will see the parental alienation going on and shut you down.\n\nYou might not have like counseling as a child, but your daughter needs it, this isn't normal behaviour for a 10 year old. She is to young to understand how your and your wife's actions are influencing her opinion of her mother. She needs someone outside the home to help her process her feelings. And frankly you need a structured way to communicate with your ex to better co-parent. \n\nDo better for your child and remember she is 10 and it's your responsibility to ensure all her emotions needs are being met.

The best thing for a child in most instances is to have two parents who can effectively co-parent with each other. You are actively alienating her mother. FYI the labels should be mom and stepmom.

My ex and I are no longer together and I pay for 98% of things related to them. Not because I have to, but because I can.

I am fortunate to be in a position where this is possible and do it because I\u2019m making sure my children\u2019s needs are met no matter where they are. My feelings for my ex do not trump their needs. \n\n3.

You give her things that her mum couldn\u2019t regardless of how hard she works BECAUSE she dropped out of education to provide for her child. It is your responsibility as her father to ensure that her relationship with her mother is protected. She is not abusive, she\u2019s trying to teach your daughter to share and interact with family.

Your child feels like she can't be comfortable with her mother and trusts her step mother more because of the relationship they have formed. It doesn't matter whether or not her mum might be good, your daughters care and safety and comfortableness comes first. In this instance from what you have given us, her bio mum makes her uncomfortable by forcing her to do things like share her personal things that she should feel like should be her own. She respects you more than her mother because she can be understood by you. In the future she will feel more incline to talk to you in her teen years then her mother whether it's about her period or even boys and grades. This is what most girls in teen years would feel uncomfortable doing if you would be treating her as if her feelings and all don't matter but you are showing you care about her feelings and how comfortable she feels. She loves you and respects you and also very much TRUSTS you. That's something every girl wants to do with their father.\n\nWhat I don't understand, if these tables were switched, everyone here would be calling the father the asshole and the mother not the asshole so tell why would any of what I have stated makes him the asshole in any way.\n\nOP keep being the father your daughter needs.
