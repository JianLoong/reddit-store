Emily and I never got along when our daughter was born, mainly because she always calls cps on me about child maintenance(support when we have shared custody). i was financially stable at 21 because i had won the loterry recently and invested  it in a successful business. On the other hand, Emily was from the USA and had to drop out of university for out baby which caused a lot of issues when raising our daughter. This is because she had a full time job to help raise her daughter meaning she was always busy. While I chose  to work at home on my buisness until my daughter was 4 (we both lived separately). Around this time i married another woman (katie) who I had twins with. Katie always loved my daughter as her own and never chose favourites between mine and hers. My daughter eventually began calling her mommy katie which infuriated Emily for no reason. Long story short it was recently my 10yrs old daughter birthday party, and when she blew out her candle she wished for a hug from her mom. She ran to katie. I was obvivously happy to see my daughter happy, though emily was in tears. She began shouting at both me and katie for spoiling our daughter to like us better. Then she began ranting on how horrible we are to treat her like this for 6yrs. I was about to kick her out before our daughter sreamed she hated Emily and that Katie was the best mother. This happened a 3 days ago and i haven't heard from her since. Her parents called me shouting for always treating their daughter like crap and nor finacially providing for her like a man. I told them to fuck off brfore I hung up. I don't think I did anything wron but i keep getting angry phone calls from her family members. katie says we didn't do anything wrong and it's her fault for being a horrible mother. My daughter is pretty much ok and is enjoying her presents. So AITA here or not.\n\nJust to clear a few ponits that everyone is commenting. I always disipline my daughter when she needs its and i teach her responsibility all the time. so I'm not the just the \"fun\" dad i'm a father who rewards her child when they listen and does great in school. Second point is that blood doesn't make family love does. I hated nearly everyone blood related to me but i was force to act like i love them. Never gonna happen with my kids. I can't force my daughter to love someone. if anything I'm proud that my daughter was able to scream what she said. i never had that courage as a child. Also my number one responsibility is to do what is best in my daughter life not mine.  \n\nBecause you all wanted to here things that make emily a horrible mother here it is.\nwhile my daughter is at  emily place she prefers to stay in her room most of the time but whenever emily has family over she forces my daughter to interact with them. If my daughter wants to stay in her room she should be allowed. that is her right. They have the aducity to make a few jokes about my daughter growing up in the \"posh\" area. My daughter hates these jokes but emily does nothing. My daughter usally refuses to eat with strangers but here is emily forcing her to do so never the less most food she makes is unhealthy. She also forces her to share her things ( that i dam bought her) with her cousins) especially her phone and tablet. Even some of her clothes. Emily keeps telling me she is teaching our daughter to share but my daughter hates to share just like i hated it too. Why should she  have to share her own stuff epecialy when emily didn't buy it for her. This is fucking disgusting. SO here is why i hate emily more than ever\n\nJust to make this clear me and my daughter of course are two different people but i'm one of the few adults who know her the best. I understand she hates to share and she tells me she hates to share with her mother side of the family. I buy her everything when she stays at her mothers because i thought that would solve the issue of sharing her mothers stuff. but no these people think touching my daughter property is ok because we are \"family\". I told them to stop with what i call abuse and have made my daughter to put locks and passowrds on everything. Emily exuse was she wanted to help bond her with her family. I even bought my daughter a sectret walkie talkie for an emergency incase anything happens. I can't deal with this woman so i need full custody of my child. My daughter has hobies like horse ridding and swimming sometimes but because of emily she has missed a few lessons. Emily told me it was better to spend time with the \"family\". instead my daughter doing her fucking hobby. I don't know how you can defend this woman. My daughter still hasn't even gone through her first period and i already know that is going to start another fuss on who is going to teach her to be clean or whatever. \n\n\nIT'S NOt MY RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PAY FOR SOMEONE else child EDUCATION THAT WAS HER PARENTS JOB NOT MINE. MY JOB IS TO PAY FOR MY CHILDREN EDUCATION WHICH I PAY BY MYSELF BY THE WAY. I   SEND all  MY KIDS TO PRIVATE SCHOOL and i'm the only one paying here.\n I DIDNT HELP HER FINACIALLY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TOO. I DON'T CARE If SHE IS THE  MOTHER OF MY CHILD I  DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TP PAY FOR \"HER NEEDs\" i only pay for my child needs\n\n\nI read a comment saying is the gender was reversed you would all be cheering for me and I agree. You mostly hate me for being a man with money BUT if i was a women it would be outrageous for a man to ask for money on 50/50 custody. My daughter is upstairs doing her homework now before she can go have fun. We plan on having dinner like a family later. Christmans is coming and i can' wait to see my daughter smile when she opens her gifts. Thank you for all the people who saw my side of the post. I may post an update the next time i talk to emily but i don't know or csre right now. I'm about to help my daughter with her homework if she needs it.\n\nJUST TO MAKE THIS CLEAR SHE COULD HAVE HAD AN ABORTION i even offered to help pay but she refused. she wanted to be a mother and now shie is a mother of a 10yrs old girl. i never forced her to be pregnant.\n\nTo make this clear i always wanted to be a father since i was a litte kid but i was never going to force someone to carry my child so that is why i offered to pay for an abortion if she wanted one. I was not mad that she chose to keep it ; i was really exited actually. I also paid for the whole medical bill and all hospital expenses. incuding all the baby clothes and baby food for nearly a whole dam year. What i didn't pay for was her need such as her : clothes, food, phone, fun expenses, and so on. She wanted to be treated like a queen and i refused. I have always been paying for my child school trips, medical bills, holidays, toys, bikes, and what ever.\n\nHorse riding is for my daughter sake not mine. I began giving her lseson when she was 5 but i wanted to stop a few years later after she gotten hurt. But she began to cry and scream but i stopped anyway. then my daughter began to get worse kind of and the teachers notice. horse ridding helps her emtionally i think i don't know. So i let her carry one as long she promised she would behave and be safe. So horse ridding is kind of a must for her. Emily knows this and is disturning her lessons on purpose.\n\njust to make this clear. in england 50/50 custody means 50/50. so i legaly I don't have to pay child maintenance(support) not matter how much more one parents  earns.", "created_utc": 1668244949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt1zar/aita_for_allowing_my_daughter_to_call_my_wife_her/", "score": 406, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You constantly undermine her, you didnt support her while she was pregnant and you obviously dislike her for whatever reasons.  I think you encourage your daughter to be disrespectful of her mother and im pretty sure you talk crap about her mothers way of raising her to her or in her presence. You refuse to get her any therapy cause you didnt like therapy at her age etc. You want her to hate her mother as much as you do and that makes you the biggest ah.", "Giant YTA. \nThis child was seemingly born around the time of the lotto win. Pregnant or newly post partum, she had to give up her education and work when you theoretically could have easily supported the child on your own to let her get a degree to hopefully let her make something of herself since you were set. So now the child has a rich parent and a poor parent at war, when she may have had a shot at two successful parents who were friends. Did you intentionally want her to be less-than so you could always be superior for some reason? Even 10yrs on, I still dont see even one suggestion or desire here of supporting a good mother/daughter relationship. That is what a good coparent does: They unify and support family bonds. Yet here you are gleeful that your daughter dislikes her and now want full custody. Disturbing.", "YTA.  It sounds like you're having serious difficulty in separating what you want from what your daughter needs.  Nearly everything you've said reeks of projection.  I can clearly see how you are manipulating your daughter to achieve what **you** want - which appears to be to abuse your ex with impunity.\n\nI'm not at all surprised that you didn't want to attend therapy for your own good and I suspect you keep your daughter from therapy because you are afraid of what she might disclose about you.\n\nY most definitely TA.", "Nothing that OP has posted supports Katie's claims that Emily is a bad mother. \n\nBut what really concerns me is that a ten-year old child is so alienated from her birth mother that she makes her preferences for her step mother so very very clear. Typically, a child has been removed from her the birth parent's life (because of how toxic that relationship is) before such clear preferences are stated. \n\nThat OP seems to encourage this alienation from the birth mother adds a whole other layer of complexity here in that it makes me think that maybe, just maybe, OP has allowed his own personal history with the birth mother to contaminate how their daughter thinks of her birth mother.  \n\nThere's a whole lot of history to unravel. This is way more complicated than simply: \"my daughter blew up at her mom during her birthday party.\" \n\nI have no judgement to make; but I would strongly urge some family counseling for the adults on how to be better parents and some individual therapy for the 10 year old.", "YTA \n\nYou said in a comment \u201cI don\u2019t spoil my daughter so she loves me more, I spoil her so she can live the childhood I never had \u201c\n\nSo you are spoiling her and of course she is gonna love your house more compared to her poor mom. \n\n\nThen you going to say you don\u2019t want her to go to therapy because you hated therapy when you were young.

This is because she had a full time job to help raise her daughter meaning she was always busy.\n\nOkay, to clarify one thing: You got Emily pregnant when you were both 21. You had *won the lottery* back then and were financially stable. You worked from home in your own business. But Emily had to drop out of university  and take on a full time job while raising your new born child/toddler, yes?\n\nWhy in the world did you not help her out financially? No matter if you got along or not, you impregnated this woman and then watched her sacrificing her career and becoming a struggling mom with too much on her plate?\n\nAnd then you encouraged your daughter being estranged from her because you and your wife are financially able to give her more opportunities and things...\n\nYour childs relationship to her bio mom is important and it would be your and your wifes responsibility to protect this relationship.\n\nI've read nothing here that suggests Emily is a bad mom. Having a 10 year old help in the house is normal and so is time out for bad behaviour. You really seem to spoil your daughter to make yourselves favourites.\n\nYeah, YTA.", "I'm sorry but YTA.\nYour daughter has a mother who, from everything you've said so far, loves her enough to give up her own dreams to give birth and raise her. \nYou sound like the 'fun' parent.

She is 10, not 18, and does not fully understand the consequences of what you are suggesting. What if something happens to her mother because of this and she blames you and your wife? Can you with 100% certainty guarantee that your wife will always treat her the same as her bio kids?

When she becomes older, she can make a decision who she wants in her life. Not at 10.  You need to communicate with her sensitively about how she only has one mum and dad.

You have shared nothing to show her mother is anything but a struggling single women who loves her daughter. Of course she enjoys your home more, your rich, have a wife and more children and you don't make her work around the home. Your ex can't give her the life she thinks she wants, but she is to young to understand that the vaule her mother has to her is more than money and a easy life. She will understand that when she is a adult and she will blame you for ending her relationship with her bio-mum. \n\nYou are failing your daughter. Your wife is failing your daughter.

They will see the parental alienation going on and shut you down.\n\nYou might not have like counseling as a child, but your daughter needs it, this isn't normal behaviour for a 10 year old. She is to young to understand how your and your wife's actions are influencing her opinion of her mother. She needs someone outside the home to help her process her feelings.

It is your responsibility as her father to ensure that her relationship with her mother is protected. She is not abusive, she\u2019s trying to teach your daughter to share and interact with family.

Your child feels like she can't be comfortable with her mother and trusts her step mother more because of the relationship they have formed. It doesn't matter whether or not her mum might be good, your daughters care and safety and comfortableness comes first. In this instance from what you have given us, her bio mum makes her uncomfortable by forcing her to do things like share her personal things that she should feel like should be her own. She respects you more than her mother because she can be understood by you. In the future she will feel more incline to talk to you in her teen years then her mother whether it's about her period or even boys and grades. This is what most girls in teen years would feel uncomfortable doing if you would be treating her as if her feelings and all don't matter but you are showing you care about her feelings and how comfortable she feels. She loves you and respects you and also very much TRUSTS you. That's something every girl wants to do with their father.\n\nWhat I don't understand, if these tables were switched, everyone here would be calling the father the asshole and the mother not the asshole so tell why would any of what I have stated makes him the asshole in any way.\n\nOP keep being the father your daughter needs.

Maybe it's that she doesn't want it to break which can be helped by them playing around her so she can tell them if they're being too rough, maybe it's because she doesn't know them well enough so they could bring their own stuff and spend time around each other in her room where she feels safe, maybe it's because she doesn't want it getting lost so they can check where she wants it put afterwards, or many other reasons. It'll help in the long run because it'll help her find out what people can be trusted because if they can then they'll work with her instead of just responding with some bs like \"we're family so it's ok\".", "YTA.

You don't think the kid having to share when she doesn't feel at ease doing so is bad mothering?\nKid's 10, she's old enough to tell that mum pushes things that make me feel bad and dad and stepmum listen to me when I tell them I'm not happy doing stuff.

We're also not \"unclean\" during menstrual periods, giving off some misogynistic vibes here.

I think we can agree to disagree.", "Yeah I\u2019m telling you that is not the bar for being an asshole. Just a disagreement of how op needed to spend his money. Sounds smart to me that he used it to set up his life. You sound like you need to learn to me for the record, so that goes both ways. I\u2019m 38. Based on how well your taking this disagreement, one of us does need to be more mature.", "And that\u2019s not true. If there\u2019s a major difference in income, child support can be requested and granted. Which sounds like the case.", "He has split custody, that\u2019s the sharing. What is not to get.

I meant more like OP and his wife manipulating the hell out of this 10 year old girl.  That became crystal clear as I kept reading his responses.  I just hope this girl realizes what they\u2019ve done to her and her relationship with her mother one day.  Katie is in on it too by calling Emily a terrible mother.  It\u2019s sick how their trying to alienate Emily from her own daughter.", "Why should he pay for Emily\u2019s education if they aren\u2019t together? They had 50/50 custody in the UK. She could have done PT or even online learning.", "I hope Emily finds this and can use it to fight for custody. Emily is teaching the daughter to be a rounded person. She's teaching her manners, like acknowledging company, and not being on her phone all the time. (A 10 year old shouldn't have complete access to a smartphone, imo)\n\nOP is saying he doesn't discipline or give chores. He literally said he spoils her because he can, not because she deserves it. He gave her a secret communication device for when she's supposed to be with her mom. I wouldn't be surprised if OP is basically telling her constantly \"remember, things suck at your mom's. You have all your toys and no rules here\"", "You have manipulated your daughter with MONEY. Emily's only fault is not being wealthy. \n\nIt's so incredibly sad that you've done this to the daughter you allegedly love so much.", "Just wait until the court hears about your trying to alienate her bio mother. You're in for a big surprise if you think the court will go, \"yeah, she likes her dad spoiling her more than her mom making her share. You should get alllll the custody to really stick it to your ex! Yes, that's great!\"", "Op don\u2019t listen to most these people. You have 50/50;custody. Her mom has the same opportunities as you to develop a relationship. She is just choosing to not listen to what your daughter wants and needs causing herself to not be able to bond.  Instead saying how it\u2019s all your fault. Some people act like moms are perfect if they are just present at the minimal which is not true.  The only thing that would make you TA is if you and your wife talk negative about her mom in front of her which would not be right. otherwise daughter is getting to the age she can form her own opinion based on parenting skills and relationships", "The OP isn't hearing what he wanted to hear so he is doubling down in an attempt to get us to support him.\n\nBut parental alienation is hurting his daughter. He hates her mom so much that he doesn't even think she can show her own daughter how to handle her period?\n\nDude needs counseling desperately and so does daughter.", "So you believe you can be a decent dad while purposefully alienating a child from the other parent?\n\nYes agree to disagree. He is an awful dad who is hurting his daughter. He needs counseling so he understands what he is doing. The daughter needs counseling to understand that money is not what makes you a good parent.\n\nThe daughter needs to be away from him until the parental alienation stops.\n\nThen they can go back to 50/50 because you are right. \n\nShe needs both parents.", "[removed]", "That\u2019s not the way split/joint custody works. \nThe lower earning parent usually still gets child support from the higher earning parent even if splitting 50/50.", "Who said he had to pay for her education? What he could have done was pay for childcare/full time help so that she could finish her education. \n\nThis is about long term benefit for his child. Having a mother who is educated and able to be financially secure is a long term benefit for his daughter. \n\nI could also go into the way in which unplanned pregnancies statistically impact the financial health of the mother to a larger degree then the fathers, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of line to expect someone who had the good luck to win the lottery to do something to remedy that inequality.", "I disagree with you entirely, so yeah. Your argument is thin, you are reading lots of words that were not written. Cast op as the villain an the ex as the protagonist.

That s fair. He\u2019s still TA for it, but you\u2019re right about UK rules.", "How does going to court help OP?", "Not sure how he is TA for following the rules. The bar is set higher than the law, and she should have been made a sugar baby I suppose\u2026 I\u2019m still out on the finances.
