Emily and I never got along when our daughter was born, mainly because she always calls cps on me about child maintenance(support when we have shared custody). i was financially stable at 21 because i had won the loterry recently and invested  it in a successful business. On the other hand, Emily was from the USA and had to drop out of university for out baby which caused a lot of issues when raising our daughter. This is because she had a full time job to help raise her daughter meaning she was always busy. While I chose  to work at home on my buisness until my daughter was 4 (we both lived separately). Around this time i married another woman (katie) who I had twins with. Katie always loved my daughter as her own and never chose favourites between mine and hers. My daughter eventually began calling her mommy katie which infuriated Emily for no reason. Long story short it was recently my 10yrs old daughter birthday party, and when she blew out her candle she wished for a hug from her mom. She ran to katie. I was obvivously happy to see my daughter happy, though emily was in tears. She began shouting at both me and katie for spoiling our daughter to like us better. Then she began ranting on how horrible we are to treat her like this for 6yrs. I was about to kick her out before our daughter sreamed she hated Emily and that Katie was the best mother. This happened a 3 days ago and i haven't heard from her since. Her parents called me shouting for always treating their daughter like crap and nor finacially providing for her like a man. I told them to fuck off brfore I hung up. I don't think I did anything wron but i keep getting angry phone calls from her family members. katie says we didn't do anything wrong and it's her fault for being a horrible mother. My daughter is pretty much ok and is enjoying her presents. So AITA here or not.\n\nJust to clear a few ponits that everyone is commenting. I always disipline my daughter when she needs its and i teach her responsibility all the time. so I'm not the just the \"fun\" dad i'm a father who rewards her child when they listen and does great in school. Second point is that blood doesn't make family love does. I hated nearly everyone blood related to me but i was force to act like i love them. Never gonna happen with my kids. I can't force my daughter to love someone. if anything I'm proud that my daughter was able to scream what she said. i never had that courage as a child. Also my number one responsibility is to do what is best in my daughter life not mine.  \n\nBecause you all wanted to here things that make emily a horrible mother here it is.\nwhile my daughter is at  emily place she prefers to stay in her room most of the time but whenever emily has family over she forces my daughter to interact with them. If my daughter wants to stay in her room she should be allowed. that is her right. They have the aducity to make a few jokes about my daughter growing up in the \"posh\" area. My daughter hates these jokes but emily does nothing. My daughter usally refuses to eat with strangers but here is emily forcing her to do so never the less most food she makes is unhealthy. She also forces her to share her things ( that i dam bought her) with her cousins) especially her phone and tablet. Even some of her clothes. Emily keeps telling me she is teaching our daughter to share but my daughter hates to share just like i hated it too. Why should she  have to share her own stuff epecialy when emily didn't buy it for her. This is fucking disgusting. SO here is why i hate emily more than ever\n\njust to make this clear. in england 50/50 custody means 50/50. so i legaly I don't have to pay child maintenance(support) not matter how much more one parents  earns.", "created_utc": 1668244949, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt1zar/aita_for_allowing_my_daughter_to_call_my_wife_her/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you encourage your daughter to be disrespectful of her mother and im pretty sure you talk crap about her mothers way of raising her to her or in her presence.

Pregnant or newly post partum, she had to give up her education and work when you theoretically could have easily supported the child on your own to let her get a degree to hopefully let her make something of herself since you were set. So now the child has a rich parent and a poor parent at war, when she may have had a shot at two successful parents who were friends. Did you intentionally want her to be less-than so you could always be superior for some reason? Even 10yrs on, I still dont see even one suggestion or desire here of supporting a good mother/daughter relationship. That is what a good coparent does: They unify and support family bonds. Yet here you are gleeful that your daughter dislikes her and now want full custody. Disturbing.", "YTA.  It sounds like you're having serious difficulty in separating what you want from what your daughter needs.  Nearly everything you've said reeks of projection.

Typically, a child has been removed from her the birth parent's life (because of how toxic that relationship is) before such clear preferences are stated. \n\nThat OP seems to encourage this alienation from the birth mother adds a whole other layer of complexity here in that it makes me think that maybe, just maybe, OP has allowed his own personal history with the birth mother to contaminate how their daughter thinks of her birth mother.  \n\nThere's a whole lot of history to unravel. This is way more complicated than simply: \"my daughter blew up at her mom during her birthday party.\" \n\nI have no judgement to make; but I would strongly urge some family counseling for the adults on how to be better parents and some individual therapy for the 10 year old.", "YTA \n\nYou said in a comment \u201cI don\u2019t spoil my daughter so she loves me more, I spoil her so she can live the childhood I never had \u201c\n\nSo you are spoiling her and of course she is gonna love your house more compared to her poor mom. \n\n\nThen you going to say you don\u2019t want her to go to therapy because you hated therapy when you were young.

You had *won the lottery* back then and were financially stable. You worked from home in your own business. But Emily had to drop out of university  and take on a full time job while raising your new born child/toddler, yes?\n\nWhy in the world did you not help her out financially?

When she becomes older, she can make a decision who she wants in her life. Not at 10.  You need to communicate with her sensitively about how she only has one mum and dad.

She had to buy maternity clothing, she had to buy items for the baby, she had medical expenses due to the baby, and gas/travel due to the baby. Your responsibility doesn't start when the baby pops out, it starts the moment you realize you're going to have one. \n\nSitting in the corner and teaching her to clean up after herself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it sounds like y'all have two very different parenting approaches. Y'all (you, the ex and your wife) might benefit from going to counseling together to learn how to effectively coparent so that you can come up with a system that enforces the same rules/values in a similar manner, and so you get better at communicating with each other when it comes to her needs or as certain situations arise.", "yes of cource. everything I do is for my daughter sake", "Because its exactly what he wants. Nothing about this is about his daughter. Her current behaviour favours him. I bet he wouldn't act like that if it was the other way around.", "my daughter is just allowing her feelings to be heard. i will never force her to feel like she can't speak the truth when it really matters. me and my wife are dealing with this situation as gentle as possible so it causes no problem for my daughter", "Instead he used Emily for free childcare for the first few years of his daughter's life so he could use his lottery winnings to start up a business from home. \n\nSo it's not just that he didn't help her, he outright exploited her for his benefit. Which in turn put Emily behind in being able to build a career and stable financial future for herself and her daughter.", "Exactly this OP. Your not even supporting the relationship she has. You are trying to end it. For a 10 year old girl. \n\n\nAnd I don\u2019t care how long your wife has known your daughter. She\u2019s not her mum. Allowing her to persist in calling her mum is supporting the END of a relationship with her ACTUAL MOTHER.", "i think i'm just allowing my daughter to feel what she wants to feel. I'm not gonna tell her what she feels is wrong especially when it isn't. yes we always had 50 custody and i always provide for my daughter", "I don't think enforcing unnecessary rules is a good things. My daughter is mostly an angel with me and always learn from her mistakes. Though when at her mothers she won't even give her a second chance to fix her mistake. How my daughter behaves at her mother place is the reflection of how she is treated. Like her mother always forces a conversation between the two of them and also takes away her phone when she refuses. Though my daughter always tells me things that haaappened in school without me asking her. so i don't think my parenting skills are the main issue here. thank you for the advice though. I will look in how to better coparent for my daughter sake", "You're alienating her from her mother and poisoning her against her", "Then take her to therapy to help her resolve her feelings.", "Some of the things you are doing are absolutely right - like standing up for things your daughter wants/doesn't want, but they have to be mature conversations between two adults, no matter how much you hate each other and the situations you find yourselves in. \n\nDoing what is best for your daughter will often involve doing things that may make you go against your own interests - including interacting amicably with your ex. \n\nAgain as stated before your ex seems to be guilty of neglecting your daughter's feelings regarding certain situations - this is a basic neglect which most parents are guilty of in some way shape or fashion, most of the time without even knowing about it till later in their child's life. In no way does it seem like Emily is directly abusing or ill-treating your daughter. There is a huuuuuuge difference!\n\nHowever, the way you and Emily are behaving towards each other is atrocious. You both need to work your shit out with a therapist, and learn how to be good co-parents. Remember parenting is not about which parent wins at the end. As it turned out with me - through therapy and learning about things i developed a healthy and loving relationship akin a close friendship with a parent who Insaw as abusive when young. If we had done therapy together at a younger age, it would have helped both of us heal sooooo much faster. \n\nYou are using your own experience:saying YOU hated therapy - as a way not to get your daughter into it. The problem with therapy is that it hurts and can be frustrating. You are confronting your demons in a confined setting. Therapy isnt all hugs and smiles, it can be tears and heart ache and yearning and more, but it's okay because it's a safe space to actually let out everything you think inside. Use it as that.", "Yeah and the only reason it favour him was that he was lucky enough to win the lottery but did absolutely f*** all to help out bio mother. Bloke has made no sacrifices in his life whilst the mom has to give up on everything it seems to be able to look after her daughter", "Yet you are planning on ostracising your daughter from her mother by planning on filing for full custody", "No. You\u2019re allowing her to feel what benefits you and your wife. All the negative things you have mentioned, have to do with your direct relationship with bio mom. Even you have not said anything negative about her parenting.", "There is a difference between listening to your daughter\u2019s feelings (yay!) vs validating them (not good in this case). She may be telling you what she thinks you want to hear or she may rightly feel this way. Your job is to encourage her to explore ALL these feelings in a safe place (like therapy which is a very different experience now than decades ago).\n\nAt age ten, I wanted no contact with my own father. My mother listened to me but always offered me kind stories of my father. She wanted to make sure that I had the entire picture of a very complex human. She involved therapists and forced counseling sessions where and my dad and I were supported in discussing our issues. She did this because I was a child with lots of emotions I needed to process. She also did this so I could make the best decision later in life on how involved I wanted my father to be in my life. I\u2019m so grateful for her support, not judgment!", "You had 50/50 custody of a newborn baby?", "Children often behave the worst in the setting they are most comfortable. Where they can fully relax and let go. I think you've left a lot of info out here.", "It\u2019s interesting to me that in every comment you ignore people calling you out for not supporting Emily during the pregnancy despite having the financial means to do so. Her inability to get an education impacts her and your daughter, but you did nothing to potentially prevent that.", "seems my daughter is unhappy to spend time with her boi mom so i won't force her to go. it is a horrible thing to make a kid spend time with someone thet hate or don't like", "You and your wife are the cause of that though but you can\u2019t seem to realise that nor do you want to fix those issues apparently but would rather just push that whole situation aside so you can have your perfectly little family.", "Actually, unless there is abuse happening, which isn\u2019t the case here, what you are teaching your daughter is that she should walk away from any situation or person she doesn\u2019t like.   This is not what your child needs to learn.    \n\nShe needs to learn to understand people who are different from her, be comfortable in a variety of different situations, and be okay with discomfort as long as she is safe.         \n\n\nSometimes it is hard to build relationships with someone, but that doesn\u2019t always mean it isn\u2019t worth it.      \n\n\nYou are setting your daughter up for a future where she behaves in appropriately with peers, classmates, and coworkers.   There are going to be people she has to spend time with and doesn\u2019t like at work, in university, and in life..   She needs to know how to do this successfully.    Do better, Dad.", "Of course he isn\u2019t mad because the daughter isn\u2019t hating him.\nI doubt he would like it if his daughter called another man \u201cdaddy\u201d", "I know, he claims to be doing all this for his daughters benefit but all I hearing is him pushing his own agenda through", "Exactly did you hear him say he does spoil her because he wants her to have the childhood he didn\u2019t have. \n\nHe didn\u2019t help Emily during the pregnancy even with lottery money. \n\nHe is 100% trying to make sure daughter likes his house more\n\nHow he won\u2019t have his daughter get therapy because he didn\u2019t like therapy when he was young"]}
