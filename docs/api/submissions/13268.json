Thank you!", "You're welcome. It sucks to have sensitive skin. Hopefully you will find the right combo. Your relatives just need to STFU & stop trying to tell you what to do with your body.", "They should have learned that they can't control me when I went and got my septum pierce for my 17th birthday. Luckily, my dad doesn't care what I do as long as I'm happy and healthy, so he took me to get my septum pierced.", "NTA. You have autonomy over your body. Just ask your aunt to grow out her mustache to set a good example for the girls that a persons worth isn't based on their looks.", "Your legs, your life. NTA", "NTA. Your aunt is the unreasonable one, preferring that you suffer physical pain to, well, living your life. \n\nAlso, this demand of hers comes after just visiting? WTF? I would laugh in her face.", "Shaina Twain doesn't in Winter, so why should you!", "Hey kids are too young to know that some people get rid of their leg hair, so that\u2019s not even a valid concern in my opinion. Also why are we exacerbating ridiculous sexist gender norms, especially to small children? Ugh I\u2019m sorry you experienced that.", "NTA", "NTA. Your aunt can go pound sand.", "She sucks and she isn't worth your time!  You leave your legs however you want, no need to get itchy for her!", "Pffft, I'd go a step further and shape the leg hair with wax and wear short shorts in her presence.\n\nBut I'm an ass, so...", "NTA. \n\nI rarely shave, and when I do, it\u2019s either because I just washed my sheets and love that feeling, feel like it, or I\u2019m seeing a new doctor. \n\nMy hubby is used to my unshaven legs (sometimes I shave to surprise him) and not once has he said anything. \n\nYour aunt is insane and has entirely too much interest in what you do with your body.", "They? Are? Toddlers? Why is she even thinking about this yet???\n\nEven then, NTA. Shaving/waxing legs is such a huge pain that I completely gave up on it over a decade ago (and I wear lots of shorts and sundresses!).", "ESH. Your aunt is TA for obvious reasons and youre TA because I believe you know you did nothing wrong but posted here anyways.", "NTA\n\nNext time, ask them why you have to shave. What does she mean by setting a good example? Then follow up any response with \"So you think your great grandmother was (unhygienic, unladylike, etc.)\" I don't know about your country, but women in the US didn't start shaving until the early-mid 1900s.", "NTA Is this for real? Your aunt and uncle CONFRONTED you over your legs?", "NTA. Your skin is sensitive, so you have a right to do what you feel is best for you. Besides, not everybody shaves their legs. I don't bother because the hair grows back too quickly. Sometimes people make fun of me during the summer when it's swimsuit season but that's their problem. Your aunt has some serious problems. From what I see, since you said your cousins don't really care about whether you have hair or not, I would assume that they probably don't even notice. She needs to keep her opinions to herself!", "I told my girlfriend that I don't shave when we first started talking. She said that she doesn't care and that she shaves just because it makes her feel more feminine. Even if she did care, I wouldn't have changed it. A good partner shouldn't fully care about whether or not their partner has body hair or not. As long as a person keeps up with their hygiene, it shouldn't matter.", "When I hit my goal weight, my fiance complimented me on it in terms of how impressed he was with my ability to set a goal and stick to it until I achieved it. There was no undertone of, \"Your body was gross before and now it looks good!\" I think that is a nice way to phrase it.", "Wait Wait.. So seeing the gays transmits it too? I just can't win.", "Can confirm, I saw a bi woman when I was 17. That\u2019s how it all starts."]}
