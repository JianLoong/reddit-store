Finding a sitter that wants to handle 7 kids right after you move to a new place isn\u2019t easy, I\u2019m child free by choice too but I\u2019m also judging them for their attitude towards children because they sound miserable since they spend every moment near children complaining about the fact that kids make noise. \n\nI mean OP did exactly what this sun tells everyone in this situation to do, skipped out on the wedding since it\u2019s child free and she had kids, what do you want her to do?", "She has a 2 month old tho.

OP is NTA here.", "What a weird take.\n\nIt's not snubbing the wedding, she said she didn't have a sitter and didn't want to leave her very young children with a stranger. Many parents won't attend childfree weddings due to childcare considerations, in the same way many people won't attend destination weddings due to budget or leave considerations.\n\nSnubbing would be having had an offer of suitable childcare she used on a regular basis and trusted and could afford and simply saying \"well if my kids aren't invited I'm not going\" and giving the couple a hard time about their decision to not have children at their wedding... But that isn't the circumstances described in the post.", "Am I reading this wrong, you sound like your judging her for being a parent which is no one\u2019s business, her family or yours. And even if her 7 kids are total stinkers it\u2019s super rude to talk shit about people regardless of their age, and you\u2019re assuming they are poorly behaved.\n\nOP never said she was mad it was child free.

A invitation is not a summons. Not everyone is comfortable with a sitter. It's well within their rights to have child free wedding.  It you don't get to have a child free wedding and get mad when parents can't attend.", "Agree with this.

Good grief.", "A child free wedding means not all will be able to go and you cannot force people to accept.
