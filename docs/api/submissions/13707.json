She doesn't avoid him or treat him badly but your sister is intent on making a problem where there isn't one.", "NAH, you supported your daughter the correct way teaching her it's not her responsibility to make everyone happy. His emotions are his responsibility. She did nothing wrong . She did not snub him nor insult him, just didn't want to hang out with him based on a strange qualifier such as age. \nIf more girls were taught to create and maintain boundaries, then smiles the world would be a better place.", "NTA\n\nNobody wants to hang around someone who\u2019s always shouting in a loud voice. It\u2019s jarring and unpleasant. Thank you for understanding and supporting your daughter, and for teaching her that her feelings are valid and deserve to be respected.", "NTA. When they did hangout what would they do?

It's sad for your nephew but it is what it is. \n\nI will admit this post tugged at my heart strings a bit because in my culture, your cousins are your first friends. But then again there are usually heaps of us (cousins) so it's easy to find someone with a common interest. That doesn't seem to be the case here.

You don't get to dictate which expect humans at a facility gathering. \n\nThey have different interests and let's not forget girls often mature a little faster at this age.\n\nThey'll prob be closer again once older.
