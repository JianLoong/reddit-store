I'm a 47-year-old man, and my wife is 41, we'll call her Holly. So, Holly had cervical cancer and can't have kids, which has always been a sensitive topic for her. She didn't like talking about it and would get pretty upset.\r  \n\r  \nBut a while back, I suggested to Holly that we should adopt because I've always dreamed of having a family. She wasn't too keen on the idea, saying it made her feel crappy and reminded her of not being able to have biological kids. But after some convincing from both me and her family, we ended up adopting two kids about nine years ago.\r  \n\r  \nNow, our adopted kids are 10 and 13, and they still have no clue that they're adopted. I thought it might be time to tell them, considering they're getting older and might understand Holly's feelings better. But when I brought it up, Holly got super emotional, started crying, and said she wasn't ready. I got frustrated and kinda shouted, telling her the kids are old enough to know, and her history with cervical cancer shouldn't be a big deal anymore. Holly responded by crying and stating that I pressured her into adoption, even though she agreed to it. She also mentioned that after \"pressuring\" her into adoption, she feels depressed and forced. This argument escalated, and she left the room, giving me the silent treatment. She even plans to leave and live with her parents for awhile. I tried telling the kids that she's having a difficult time right now. I think she's being a little dramatic about it but i don't know. Am I the asshole?  \n", "created_utc": 1698960934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mehd3/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_her_history_with/", "score": 491, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have a long road ahead of chemotherapy, surgery etc. And even if and when I go into remission, I know it's something that will continue to affect me years later because of how it has changed my life and because of all the things I'm now forced to give up.

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily a right age but any older may be wrong. Your wife\u2019s feelings don\u2019t mean they don\u2019t deserve the truth about their lives.

I'm a 47-year-old man, and my wife is 41, we'll call her Holly. So, Holly had cervical cancer and can't have kids, which has always been a sensitive topic for her. She didn't like talking about it and would get pretty upset.\r  \n\r  \nBut a while back, I suggested to Holly that we should adopt because I've always dreamed of having a family. She wasn't too keen on the idea, saying it made her feel crappy and reminded her of not being able to have biological kids. But after some convincing from both me and her family, we ended up adopting two kids about nine years ago.\r  \n\r  \nNow, our adopted kids are 10 and 13, and they still have no clue that they're adopted. I thought it might be time to tell them, considering they're getting older and might understand Holly's feelings better. But when I brought it up, Holly got super emotional, started crying, and said she wasn't ready. I got frustrated and kinda shouted, telling her the kids are old enough to know, and her history with cervical cancer shouldn't be a big deal anymore. Holly responded by crying and stating that I pressured her into adoption, even though she agreed to it. She also mentioned that after \"pressuring\" her into adoption, she feels depressed and forced. This argument escalated, and she left the room, giving me the silent treatment. She even plans to leave and live with her parents for awhile. I tried telling the kids that she's having a difficult time right now. I think she's being a little dramatic about it but i don't know. Am I the asshole?  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was adopted at birth, and I grew up knowing all about it. I don\u2019t even remember being \u201ctold\u201d that I was adopted, it was just always a fact.

My older siblings completely accepted me, loved me and never made me feel different. They *chose* me to be part of their family! All of my close friends knew that I was adopted, which led their parents to explaining it to them, too. As I got older, my parents gradually shared information about my birth parents\u2019 situation and how it led to their decision to put me up for adoption. They let me read my adoption papers, including the personal interviews that my birth mom did with the attorney, which gave insight and information about my heritage, grandparents, family history, etc. \n\nAdoption causes personal issues and emotions for the individual, obviously, but I was able to deal with it easier because I knew that I was loved and that it was a blessing.

Pretty much all psychological research on adoptees agrees that if a child is adopted when they are too young to remember it, the best way to handle it is to just make it part of their story, so they don't even remember 'finding out,' it's just something they've always known. And there's no excuse for ignorance at this point; the older kid would have been adopted in 2010, and this literature has existed for far longer than that.", "Exactly! This is a classic ESH situation. Not telling the kids is extremely selfish. And just waving away that she had cancer (+forcing into adoption) is a horrible thing to do.", "Yes.

It changed her life, everything she thought she'd be in the future is different so it matters, it still matters it doesn't mean she doesn't love the kids any less or differently in fact she wants to be seen as their only mom to feel like she did the thing even just a little bit.\n\nTldr, op you should have had this discussion about telling the kids before adopting at all, and not the goal posts are moving and it's freaking your wife out.

In simplest terms, implicit memory is not about specific events, but instead is more of an unconscious, emotional recollection. Ie, how you felt during the event, while not actually remembering the event itself. Explicit Memory requires conscious recall and is generally associated with a time and a place \u2014 the autobiographical version of memory we\u2019re used to.\n\nToddlers can make some explicit memories, but they aren\u2019t very good at it. Our brains use that time between 4 and 7 as practice. Around 7 is when we start getting good at it and the more detail oriented, adult-like memories start forming. That\u2019s why, for most people, the time until 4 years old is pretty much blank and their memory of the time between 4-7 can be a bit wishy-washy. This is known as childhood amnesia, and this amnesia effect can be exacerbated by trauma (even trauma we can\u2019t actively remember).\n\nSome people fill that time in with false memories/recollections (like, people will tell them stories about them as babies/toddlers and those stories are adopted as \u201cmemories\u201d, but they\u2019re actually just recalling a secondhand story and putting themselves in a first-person POV versus actually remembering that time, if that makes sense).

Mother has some deep trauma and I would recommend that she (or they) talks with a professional, and maybe before they talk to the children so they can get the professionals opinion on how to approach it. \n\nThis is a really hard situation for everyone, but as an adult/parent we can't let our trauma seep into the children's lives and we need to do everything we can to protect the children that we are guardians of. She seems to resent the children and OP for talking her into adopting,  the main concern has to be the children. This situation is above reddit to properly guide/assist.", "Ding ding ding", "Nah just a realist", "Agreed!! Another asshole enters the arena!! I\u2019ve watched cancer eat, literally eat away at people\u2019s mentality and do more damage than cancer itself. My dad lost his life to cancer and though it was a valiant fight, cancer ultimately killed my dad!! OP YTA and ok_drummer_7021 is certainly a narrow minded arrogant person. Get up and deal with it!?! Seriously, you \u201cok drummer\u201d have seemingly never been truly affected by someone extremely close and important to you and have had them lose their battle with cancer. I\u2019m assuming that part. It\u2019s worse losing someone to cancer than that same person being shot and killed because of the affects and aftermath cancer causes", "So what\u2019s the alternative? OP wants kids and willing to adopt at that and presumably wants share it with the wife. Before they decided to adopt, OP should\u2019ve just divorce her instead? And find someone thats more capable?", "With a husband like that, I'm not surprised. From the few things he wrote, he describes strong arming her into big decisions, prioritizing his wants, and dismissing her struggles and feelings.", "She also needs to leave him. Just my opinion as an adopted kid. No one wants to have a mom that didn't want them. That's what she's afraid of them finding out. If he tells them, it exposes that she didn't want to adopt,  then what? Ughhh this situation is so fucked\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1f my heart aches for these kids #adopteevoices #adoptiontrauma", "Yeah my thought was OP is the asshole for the way he\u2019s treating his wife but also for not getting on the same page about telling the kids. I thought it was well known advice now that they should always know, but even if you don\u2019t subscribe to that did they not have one chat about when to tell them? An age in mind? This sounds like they\u2019re winging that bit which doesn\u2019t seem great", "That's far and I'm not a child expert. Makes sense. I guess just more to normalize it.", "I\u2019m going to agree with you here as an adopted kid who was told from the start. To me it really didn\u2019t feel like a big deal, they were still my parents and they clearly chose to have me so win for me.", "Yeah and the oldest was 4 when adopted, if they\u2019re 13 now and the adoption was 9 years ago. I don\u2019t have a ton of memories from that age but I have a hard time believing the 4 year old had no idea what was happening at the time and it wasn\u2019t significant enough to remember. Unless there was some serious repressing of traumatic memories? Idk. Story seems fishy here.", "And if it reoccurs it is 10x more deadly.  Learned that on Monday.  My nieces grandma was a breast cancer survivor for 8 years. Diagnosed with lung 8 weeks ago. Died on Halloween.", "So sorry to hear that. Try to stay positive. I wish you the best.", "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through that. Warm and fuzzy wishes for easy treatments.", "That really, really sucks, and I\u2019m sorry.", "That\u2019s not true. My BIL had cancer as a kid and is officially cured now. A cousin also did, and has been officially cured for over a decade. At this point if cancer, God forbid, ever shows up again, it will be considered an entirely new illness.\n\nIt depends on the cancer, but some do have points where they are considered cured.", "This is inaccurate.", "It depends on the cancer. For some types, like leukemia, this is correct; however, for some types, you go into remission, and then after five years, they consider you cured. So for instance, I had thyroid cancer, and I've been in remission for four and a half years, and then once I hit five years, I'll be considered cured and I'll just see my endocrinologist for my medication maintenance instead of yearly ultrasounds. \n\nThe scary part is worrying about getting some other type of cancer later in life. I can't get thyroid cancer again, but I can get some other form of cancer and I'm probably at higher risk of other cancers. Which anyone who's had cancer worries about for that reason, even if they are cured from their initial cancer.", "You have no idea what you're talking about.", "Wow I wish I could give you an award for your response.  I\u2019m currently going thru radiation for breast cancer.  Diagnosis came out of left field, and the word \u201ctrauma\u201d is precisely how I describe my emotional state.  Until it happens to you, you have no freaking idea how you will feel or handle that diagnosis.  I still haven\u2019t begun to work thru the feelings and I was diagnosed months ago.  Overwhelming!!  \u2764\ufe0f", "It has to be a troll post- he is trying to claim a 4 year old (now 13 year old) has no idea OP and his wife aren\u2019t their bio parents. Have you met a 4 year old before? They aren\u2019t fucking stupid. My son is adopted and he had a very clear age appropriate understanding of the situation at 4.", "Nevermind that you hear stories about kids finding out by accident...\"we could be sisters because your mom isn't really your mom\" type thing.", "It's generally considered best practice for them to know from the get go that they are adopted. There's been quite a bit of research done on the harm of waiting until kids are older to tell them they are adopted.", "Babies are not blank slates. Parents who lie and keep secrets are the problem,  adoptive or biological.  #adopteevoices #adoptiontraumaisreal \n\nAlso the way your talking about adopted kids perpetuates the pain. We're \"real\". We're bought and sold humans. We're commodifed.  OP is a TOTAL AH. \n\n#NATIONALADOPTEEAWARENESSMONTH", "Yes, children can grasp the fact that they have been adopted at a very early age and it is well known to be best that they don't ever have to be told, it's just something they're always exposed to. Always. It is absolutely lying by omission and bad for the kids' mental wellbeing to not give them the basic information about their origins as soon as possible.", "Not in any way comparable to Easter bunny. Children that are adopted should be told as early as possible. This way it can be done lovingly and gently and they grow up knowing that they are special and wanted by the adoptees. Keeping it a secret from teenagers will always end badly, trust me.", "If we're quoting OP, he said, \"He and her family.\"\n\nIf we're going to presume harassment, it came from her own family, as well.", "I think both of y\u2019all actions caused for both of yall being AHs. If she truly didn\u2019t feel comfortable she should have stood her ground and say no she does not want kids. I think she thought about it and thought about pleasing her husband and doing it will make you happy. Not sure if you blocked out your wife\u2019s trauma or you saw a change in her mood and decided she\u2019s happier, the children are happy let\u2019s take another step and tell them they are adopted. The way she handle that situation is why I called her an AH. Yes the conversation is touchy but it\u2019s a conversation that needed to be had. Whether y\u2019all decided to tell them are not. I hope the kids did not hear y\u2019all argument because that is the wrong way to tell them. Y\u2019all need some serious therapy. Separately and jointly as husband and wife, and jointly as whole family. Y\u2019all went into a situation where dishonesty was present. And now you\u2019re going to have to figure out if y\u2019all are truly meant to be together.", "One, you don\u2019t know if he asked her every day or once a year. You just can\u2019t assumed that it is harassment. Two, the woman is an adult, she could stand on her 2 feet and said NO and tell him to NEVER bring it up again. Just like adults are allowed to change their minds from time to time. She could have been in a great mood when she said yes. Adoption is not an easy overnight process. At anytime during the process she could have used her voice and her words to change her mind again and say I don\u2019t want to do this. The failure in this situation is Honest Communication on BOTH of their parts. And kids could never be brought into unstable situations.", "Awe, when my son was younger, he would tell me he\u2019s brown and I\u2019m caramel. \u2764\ufe0f", "I'm an infant adoptee- he should raise them alone,  but God do I wish someone else had stopped those kids- this OP songs like a NIGHTMARE,  and bet those kids will eventually go no contact.

I definitely don\u2019t miss it!", "Yep. Exactly that. A difference on kids is a dealbreaker. This woman now probably needing to leave these kids is the outcome.", "Well, yes, that\u2019s quite literally exactly what he should have done, rather than pressure his wife into a lifelong commitment she really didn\u2019t want to make.", "Yeah I literally see nothing she has to gain by staying with OP.", "That was my thought too. It seems like OP was so focused on convincing his wife to adopt at all that there was no discussion about anything else related to the kids/adoption.", "Yup.  My daughter was about 3 and had split her time between me and her dad since she was born.  We were driving to her grandma\u2019s house, and it was maybe the third time going there.  Two turns before grandma\u2019s street, she says \u201cgrandma\u2019s house\u201d.

Are you a doctor specializing in oncology? If not please do not state second hand info. I had cervical cancer, went into remission, NEVER GONE/CURED.

So, it\u2019s not completely unbelievable", "Oh I know, I\u2019m in that line of work. I have seen where kids were loved and never knew, I have seen where they was told and accepted it but I definitely have seen where they was told and the child lashed out. In a lot of kids knowing that they are adopted dig up old abandonment thoughts and thinking they\u2019re going back into foster care when they are no longer loved or make mistakes. Back to what I said, it just depends on the child\u2019s mental maturity as to when is the right time to tell them.", "Who ever you are, you need to go speak to your therapist and learn to read. Nobody said you were real child.", "Not telling kids is so cruel. So selfish. Proves all the things wrong with adoption. #boughtandsold #adopteevoices", "You need to learn to read as well, because I did say the earlier the better. Just need to ensure the child is ready and can handle being told.", "I have no beef with that reading.", "Woof. Cheers to us!", "I hope it all goes well for you at the follow up.", "May you have a long and happy life with it never showing up again.", "I\u2019m not sure metastatic is \u201cearly\u201d, but I hope you have a long, comfortable life ahead of you.", "I hope all goes well for you!

My grandson had leukemia when he was younger. Drs told my daughter that by the time he was 18, as long as there were no reoccurrences he would be no more likely than anyone else to get cancer.", "As I said, \u201cit depends on the cancer\u201d. Some are considered curable, some not. My BIL got his \u201cyou are as likely to get this as anyone else\u201d card after 20 odd years cancer free. Most of those considered curable seem to be blood cancers, which was what my BIL and cousin had.", "But at four? Yeah, I\u2019m calling bullshit on that.", "The kid was 4 when they were adopted!!!!

It may improve but I will always have to be on chemo", "I honestly thought once I reached that 5 year mark, I was good to go.  BUT, you are never really off the hook.  It is important to be mindful of any thing that may be a symptom of the cancer recurring.  I was aware of some minor symptoms and asked for a CT Scan. It has been almost 4 years with the metastasis and I have a good quality of life for now.", "I mean they never reach that level again. Literally impossible. If you e already had x cancer your risk for having x cancer has increased beyond the level of everyone else. That\u2019s just how it works.

Some of the reasons why most drs don\u2019t use the word cure are that there are too few cancer cells to find, there are too few to cause any symptoms, they are in an inactive state and not growing.
