It's his passion and he has always done majority of the cooking, espically dinner, ever since our first date. His two kids, (4 and 6) also love majority of the things he makes. My son(8), however, is a very picky eater.

This is where things got fustrating.\n\nTonight, my fianc\u00e9 was going to cook enchalidas for dinner and my son, as ususal, didnt want it and asked for nuggets. My fiance basically threw up his hands while prepping dinner and has now said that he will no longer cook for this household because he is tired of his food be snarked and pushed away. He says I can do what I want for my son and I but he will no longer be disrespected. I am extremely upset and all I see is red. Granted, I know he doesnt have to cook for me but I have fallen in love with his food and I feel so damn fustrated. Am I the asshole or is he right?\n\nEDIT: I dont just let me son be a complete uncontrolled brat to my fianc\u00e9. If he whines or gets bratty he is punished or grounded.

So she was always sure to have at least one dish or side that I could eat.\n\nThe good news for my kids is that I unquestionably respected their food preferences.\n\nThe even better news is that over time we all expanded our palates very widely. The issue was the potential of forced ingestion - you instinctively reject any and all non-standard foods for fear you'll be forced to eat them. But we had a rule, you have to at least try new stuff but you never are forced to eat it.\n\nThis took the pressure off and allowed exploration, and we all have only a few \"hard no\" foods at this point. \n\nThat may not be the case for your son but PLEASE invest the $20 for a test kit to be sure.

Seems like your guy is only interested in making exactly what he wants and demanding everyone around him like and appreciate it.  \n\nA kid that's only really used to eating nuggets and ramen is going to have a hard time with that.

This isn't about his delicious cooking, it's about your son having to accept a new way of eating. His previous diet was setting him up for health problems and bad habits, no judgment, I know it can be hard. However, you have a great guy who   cooks what you can't/haven't learned yet, so definitely appreciate that. You need to do some negotiating with your son, like Mon-Frid healthy meals and maybe Saturday is nuggets. He'll come round eventually, but you have to be firm and calm.

There are creative ways you can make new food fun, and make compromises so over time he can adjust more comfortably. For your fianc\u00e9\u2019s part he should also be more understanding, and jumping to this extreme of no longer cooking for your household is insensitive, immature, and will only make it harder for your son to adjust.

But there are ways to compromise for a picky eater without making a whole new meal. \n\nFor example.. spaghetti and meatballs. My son will eat noodles, but he will not do chunky sauce. He\u2019s okay with shitty marinara or Alfredo sauce, but good, thick red sauce is not cool. We just portion out some noodles and throw butter and Parmesan on there. Enchiladas? We put the chicken and cheese inside and melt cheese on top without the sauce.

Even now with most dinners being just myself and the kids, he eats what we do with just a slight modification. It doesn\u2019t take much extra effort. Mostly just one extra pan to wash.\n\nEdited to add: I have always done the taste it rule. Typically, if there is a sauce involved, I make it separately but he has to try at least one bite of everything new. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he doesn\u2019t have to eat it but he has to at least try.

You don't force him to eat anything he doesn't want to eat, there will be no bartering, and no rewards or punishments for mealtime. You can ask him if he wants to try something, but allow him the space to choose whether or not he will. When you encourage, it should not be pushy. And no one makes negative comments about anyone's food choices. That means you must also teach your son not to speak negatively of your fianc\u00e9's cooking, not every thought needs to be said out loud.\n\nHopefully this will allow your son to be more open to trying new foods, when he's ready. Mealtimes can still be had together, and still be a family event. No one has to feel bad about their dinner. Your son can develop healthy relationships with food, and not go to bed hungry which is arguably worse for his growing little body than macaroni and chicken nuggets for dinner.\n\nTell your fianc\u00e9 that you're sorry, and that you've been frustrated too, you're going to work more on teaching your son to not be rude about his cooking. Let him know that you love his food, but you won't force him to cook for either of you if he truly doesn't want to. But suggest to him that you would still like to have meal times together because it's a great family bonding time, and that you will be responsible for cooking safe options for your son and allowing him to choose what he eats. That because fed is best, this is more about teaching him to be open to trying new things by providing them as an option, because forcing it is more likely to result in negative associations and a lot of push back. \n\nLet's be honest, if forcing it was going to work, it would have worked by now. Good luck! Picky kids can be hard, but remember that they're humans just like you.", "Im 38 and couldn\u2019t agree more. But you have to tell them to eat better sometimes.", "Stop giving him nuggets, ramen, and mac & cheese. Period. Or give it to him once a week if he eats with the family the other 6 days.", "Why is this your fianc\u00e9\u2019s job? You should work with your son to expand his food range and at that point he\u2019ll be open to eating what your fianc\u00e9 cooks. Don\u2019t dump the chore and resentment that your son will harbor on your fiance. Discipline your child, esp at the beginning of merging households.", "Have you thought about just not buying those things??? Why is an 8 year old running your kitchen?", "As a picky eater myself, you should seek help to help your son. Because if you force him, he will strugle even more. Worst case, he will puke when he is force to eat something. True story", "So the *sole* cause of this conflict was your son's refusal to try the enchiladas? For that reason, he refused to home cook any more, ever again?\n\nIf that is a complete picture of this situation, then clearly you are NTA and your fiance is an AH. \n\nBut that's a pretty extreme reaction, to say that he's not going to cook for himself, for you, for his own kids because your son is picky.", "This is Reddit, def don't come here for professional advice.", "This is AITA, it's definitely not a suitable forum for parenting advice.

YTA OP", "OP look up the Ellyn Satter institute and \u201cdivision of responsibility\u201d feeding.", "Starving out will 100% fail if it's something like ARFID, that's objectively terrible advice from a doctor. Look into food therapy if you can afford it.", "Then you take the lead? Stop the single parent victim mentality. You are not in the same situation and recognize you\u2019ve created a problem which means it\u2019s on you to solve. Just because you\u2019ve gotten used to your fianc\u00e9s cooking does not make you or your ungrateful kid entitled to it. You sound just as bad as him, throwing a temper tantrum not getting the foods you want. You\u2019ve been with your fianc\u00e9 how long? You know how to make a nutritious meal for the family at this point.", "No", "Have you considered having your son help prepare the meals? He may be more willing to try new foods if he helps prepare them. Two of my children were picky eaters and we did that as well as arranging the food attractively, such as making pretty shapes with veggies. We also would put out several nutritionous foods at each meal and not commenting on how little or much they ate. Another tactic that was helping was serving them really tiny portions so they\u2019d ask for more if they were hungry. Finally, we didn\u2019t buy junk food so any foods in the house were acceptable dietary options. \n\nOur formerly picky eaters are now adults who eat a wide variety of foods.", "I would probably brag him up about how good the food is, lol.  Do you help him in the kitchen?  My husband was like, get outta my way!  Ooor you can start to cook just before he comes in and he will see how you are doing and finish for you!   That's some advise my mil gace me once.  LoL\n\nThe thing is, trying to get your son to eat is a big deal.  He doesn't feel appreciated, it's good food and can't understand why he doesn't want to eat it.  Have you told him your side of the story about how you used to feed him?  This is a big change for your son to adapt to.   Whatever you do, don't give up trying to get your son to blend.  I wouldn't give him anything interesting to eat if he wouldn't eat whats served. That only gives him reason to look forward to the interesting stuff. I would give him something plain and boring but etable.  Nothing rewarding.  No sweets either. Sounds cruel but you are not making him starve if you give him something boring as substitute.\n\nWhen i was 12 my stepmom served me liver.  I wouldn't eat it so she saved it for the next day for breakfast, then I wouldn't eat it. She saved it for lunch. I don't remember what happened after that but she did the same thing when she served oatmeal and I can't stand oatmeal.   I don't recommend that approach.  I would starve myself before I had to take one bite of either of those things.", "Well it\u2019s got to be frustrating to have to deal with a problem behavior he had no hand in creating. I don\u2019t say this to be mean, just to give some perspective of what might cross his mind when he is in a bad place - you let a kid develop terrible eating habits while he put in the work to have two kids with well rounded habits. Now he is the one doing all the cooking work and on top of that your kid is complaining and he is expected to find ways to accommodate him.  I don\u2019t see it as a rejection of your kid, so much as frustration at ending up taking the brunt of the negatives in this situation because of things he had no say in. If you were the one cooking, it\u2019d be like you dealing with the consequences of your own mistakes. Instead, it\u2019s him.", "Food should not be used as a reward or as a punishment.", "I cook as well, he just enjoys cooking so much he tells me every day he wants to cook. Im not meaning to dump anything onto him....", "When I was a kid, I had two younger cousins that were very picky eaters. My grandparents would do everything but beat them to get them to eat and eventually they started to vomit in response. Then they\u2019d start vomiting automatically whenever they were upset (not just at the table.)\nIt was awful all around. They did eventually grow out of both the pickiness and the vomiting.", "What would you suggest?", "I agree it feels so extreme since he says how much he loves to cook for me. Could it be hes taking it to personally? Like if you dont like the food, you dont like him?", "Well by all accounts its clearly not a disorder, he's just been eating junk for the last 8 years.. Starve away..", "Its depressing that people are downvoting this and telling OP to abuse her child. Poor kid is going to end up with serious eating disorders.", "These are really awesome ideas thank you!!!", "I do help when we cook but he does majority of the cooking. But boring as in mashed potatoes or something?\n\nYes he knows how im really not the best cook and how my son and I was basically living off kraft cause i had so little money lol\n\nBut thank you for the advice!", "I can see what you mean. You think I should take over the cooking then while I deal with the pickiness?", "I\u2019m sure he actually does enjoy cooking\u2014FOR PEOPLE THAT APPRECIATE HIS EFFORTS. Your son is not appreciative so it is on YOU to cook something your son will eat, or for YOU to get your son to change. Or he can not eat. Your fianc\u00e9 will cook for YOU if you want so you only have to cook one meal. If you\u2019re trying to make him cook for 4 people plus one special meal for your son, YTA!!! \n\nIt\u2019s not your fianc\u00e9\u2019s job to accommodate and change your son\u2019s habits (which will only make him the bad guy in your son\u2019s eyes, and he\u2019s only going to hear \u201cYou\u2019re not my dad!\u201d).", "We instituted a rule that our kids had to try each new food at least three times. If they still didn\u2019t like it they didn\u2019t have to eat it ever again. We also had at least two things they would eat each night at dinner  they got tired of salads and mashed or boiled potatoes or corn and decided we were t trying to kill them with chili or meatloaf. They are now very adventurous with food", "Learn to cook.", "Does your son have take part in any of the meal prep, even if it\u2019s just having the steps in how to prepare the food and cook it explained to him?

I\u2019m assuming he doesn\u2019t have allergies or a serious food aversion because you haven\u2019t mentioned physical reactions to other food, just a refusal to eat it. So he eats what the family is eating. Period. And yes, I think you should help with the cooking. 1) it shows your son that he isn\u2019t being forced to eat \u201cgross\u201d food just because of his stepfather and 2) it shows your spouse that you have skin in the game too", "His two kids live a state over so its only 3 of us but I get your point. My fustratation is he doesnt want to cook for me either. Only himself now", "I really like that idea thank you!", "Then you think I should take over the cooking?", "Yeah, this kid isn't your kid, and this battle isn't yours to win. Jog on..", "As he should! He is not a short order cook and all the work he was doing went completely unappreciated. Why would he continue?\n\nThe world does not revolve around your child, and you\u2019re now experiencing the consequences of not nipping the rude and unappreciative attitude around food in the bud. So again, these are the consequences of your inaction, and maybe if you fix the actual issue your life will be better for it.", "He won't cook for you either because he's feeling incredibly disrespected and unappreciated right now. Your son is disrespecting him by refusing to even try the food and also whining about it and demanding nuggets, but you're also disrespecting your fianc\u00e9 by allowing your son to act this way. You say you're trying to get him to eat different things, what specifically will your son eat now that he wouldn't before?\n\nI was a picky eater as a kid (I still am, but to a less extent - I will try something before saying I don't like it) who was raised by two picky eaters, so my mom would make reasonable accommodations for me when I was a kid and too young to cook for myself. But like I would ask for cut-up hot dogs in taco shells on taco night because I hated the ground chicken my mom used. If she'd refused to cook it, I would've had to have the tacos she cooked or made myself a sandwich or something.\n\nI can only suggest for you what my mom did for me: she let me be basically made aware of various vegetables and other healthy foods and let me decide if I was interested in trying it. I'd go to the grocery store with her, and sometimes we'd go to buffets and she'd let me look at all the various foods. I ended up discovering I love broccoli because of this, I was a kid and wanted to try those trees I saw at the buffet and ended up loving them.", "Also stop giving him sweets if he tries a few bites of the meal. That teaches him the food he has is something undesirable and only the sweets are worth having. You're really setting him up to have a bad relationship with food in the future", "I think maybe work with a child therapist on this? If your child is a picky eater, you shouldn\u2019t make them separate meals. My niece was a picky eater and my sister figured out the deeper issues. A child shouldn\u2019t eat nuggets and ramen all day, and I would 100% feel your fianc\u00e9\u2019s frustration. That being said, NAH but I think you truly need to work with your child on this.", "I think the solution is to be on the same page with your fianc\u00e9. Don\u2019t give in to your son. An idea is to set meal/snack times. Your son can have as much as he wants during the meals but if he doesn\u2019t like it and chooses not to eat, then he has to wait till his next set meal/snack time (the meals and snacks are decided by you and your fianc\u00e9 NOT your son). Also, learn how to cook with your fianc\u00e9 and once you feel like you have some confidence in the kitchen, include your son in the cooking process. Also, maybe instal a blackboard or white board and write what the meals will be for each day of the week that way your son can anticipate it.", "It is a bad idea to restrict children to eating at set times.
