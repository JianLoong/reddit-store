Seems like your guy is only interested in making exactly what he wants and demanding everyone around him like and appreciate it.  \n\nA kid that's only really used to eating nuggets and ramen is going to have a hard time with that.

This isn't about his delicious cooking, it's about your son having to accept a new way of eating. His previous diet was setting him up for health problems and bad habits, no judgment, I know it can be hard. However, you have a great guy who   cooks what you can't/haven't learned yet, so definitely appreciate that. You need to do some negotiating with your son, like Mon-Frid healthy meals and maybe Saturday is nuggets. He'll come round eventually, but you have to be firm and calm.

There are creative ways you can make new food fun, and make compromises so over time he can adjust more comfortably. For your fianc\u00e9\u2019s part he should also be more understanding, and jumping to this extreme of no longer cooking for your household is insensitive, immature, and will only make it harder for your son to adjust.

He\u2019s okay with shitty marinara or Alfredo sauce, but good, thick red sauce is not cool. We just portion out some noodles and throw butter and Parmesan on there. Enchiladas? We put the chicken and cheese inside and melt cheese on top without the sauce.

Even now with most dinners being just myself and the kids, he eats what we do with just a slight modification. It doesn\u2019t take much extra effort. Mostly just one extra pan to wash.\n\nEdited to add: I have always done the taste it rule. Typically, if there is a sauce involved, I make it separately but he has to try at least one bite of everything new. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he doesn\u2019t have to eat it but he has to at least try.

You don't force him to eat anything he doesn't want to eat, there will be no bartering, and no rewards or punishments for mealtime. You can ask him if he wants to try something, but allow him the space to choose whether or not he will. When you encourage, it should not be pushy. And no one makes negative comments about anyone's food choices. That means you must also teach your son not to speak negatively of your fianc\u00e9's cooking, not every thought needs to be said out loud.\n\nHopefully this will allow your son to be more open to trying new foods, when he's ready. Mealtimes can still be had together, and still be a family event. No one has to feel bad about their dinner. Your son can develop healthy relationships with food, and not go to bed hungry which is arguably worse for his growing little body than macaroni and chicken nuggets for dinner.\n\nTell your fianc\u00e9 that you're sorry, and that you've been frustrated too, you're going to work more on teaching your son to not be rude about his cooking. Let him know that you love his food, but you won't force him to cook for either of you if he truly doesn't want to. But suggest to him that you would still like to have meal times together because it's a great family bonding time, and that you will be responsible for cooking safe options for your son and allowing him to choose what he eats. That because fed is best, this is more about teaching him to be open to trying new things by providing them as an option, because forcing it is more likely to result in negative associations and a lot of push back. \n\nLet's be honest, if forcing it was going to work, it would have worked by now.

All options are suitable for a healthy, varied diet, so no pasta if we had pasta recently.\n- The child is expected to eat a little of everything, and at least try new foods.

This way he has a sense of control over what he\u2019s eating and he can better inspect it before trying.  As an adult, I realized a lot of my issues with food had to do with the texture, and not the actual taste.  Maybe try explaining textures to him and help him recognize how different foods feel inside his mouth.  You could start with foods he likes and is comfortable with.  Have him slowly eat a bite, noting if the food feels crunchy or squishy, it it\u2019s salty or sweet, etc.  Then ask how that food made him feel.  I think helping him identify his triggers could help him feel more comfortable with new food and give him a sense of control when he gets nervous.

You can separate the food prep, where you cater to your son and he caters to his kids, but that\u2019s not really sustainable and in this case, I\u2019d say that your two families are not compatible. \n\nThe best course of action is to eliminate as much of the food that isn\u2019t healthy for your son and keep it only for maybe once a week (for example, in Sweden kids have \u201ccandy Saturdays\u201d where kids are taken to the store and they\u2019re allowed to have as much candy as they want\u2026 But only on a Saturday and not during other days of the week and it also doesn\u2019t mean they get to eat candy all day Saturday and not eat anything else) as a compromise AND get him to take 3 bites of the food your SO makes every time he is served. If he doesn\u2019t want the food, he cannot and shouldn\u2019t be forced to eat, but he cannot and shouldn\u2019t also have chicken nuggets or ramen as a backup, because that\u2019s exactly how he only gets to eat his favourite foods. \n\nAre there any healthy snacks he is willing to eat?

I can see from your comments that you are genuinely seeking help and wanting to fix this situation. \n\nMy advice Sit down and have a family meeting with you, partner and your son. Let each talk about how they are feeling. Ask why he doesn\u2019t want to try new things. What does he like/not like. What do you and partner feel and why is eating better, healthier foods important. \n\nCome up with compromises together and things to try. Like looking up recipes together on Pinterest and making them together. Maybe you and your son could take a cooking class together? Maybe make a list of absolute no foods and foods he is willing to try. Do foods like once a week where he has ability to tailor his portion himself like make your own taco bar or making healthier pizzas together. If it is spices or sauces he doesn\u2019t like then taking out his portion before those things are added. It might be that he would try some things if it was with pasta or rice or chips ect. So maybe his part might be served with that or have him agree to trying 1 new thing each night. \n\nHe will feel more involved if he is suggesting options or ideas rather than you just making all the rules. But obviously you need to tell him the ground rules. The biggest one is 100% no more being rude about what is served. Be clear that any disrespect will have consequences. He doesn\u2019t have to like everything or eat everything but he does not get to make rude comments. \n\nYou want him to feel a part of this new family dynamic and to make it clear that step dad is not the enemy here but together as a family you are making better choices and learning together. Give lots of praise and make the experience fun. Start new special traditions together just the two of you as well as part of it might be missing the old way when it was just the two of you, so make new fun ways. Even cooking homemade chicken nuggets together could be something fun and a good bridge to trying new things.

They need to involve no or limited cooking and be a viable alternative. Eg, a ham and cheese sandwich, a boiled egg and toast fingers, and a piece of fruit and a tub of yoghurt. The 8 year old gets the responsibility of organising these, and it is not 30 minutes of nuggets and chips in the oven. That way, you neither adult is fighting with the 8 year old, the alternative isn't about an expectation from the 8 year old that the adult will stop what they're doing and make something new.

Around age 2 it will be very common for him to be interested in anything but food. @Feedingpickykids on TT has a great video about it. \n\nThey grow so fast in the first year of life but now they are developing their skills and learning how to destroy your house and get into everything you don't want them to.\ud83d\ude06\n\nIt's normal for them to cut way back on food some days. As long as they are meeting milestones and are generally active you should be good. Ask doctor if you are worried.", "At 2 when you're exposing them to a bunch of new foods and they try them but maybe don't like them that is so normal! The most useful advice I got for that age was to look at the nutritional value of the foods they eat over 1 week instead of 1 day. If they're way into cheese one day and carrots another and scrambled eggs another and strawberries another etc it's okay. Look at the food consumption over a longer time period and you'll feel less stressed out over the meal time battles. Also look into making smoothies to get some veggies/yogurt/protein powder into them.

It's not always about exposure. Some kids have different a sensory experience around taste. It's one of the things.gs that they look for when diagnosing autism.  I am not trying to say that your son has autism, I don't have enough information to do that, but for example, I would never force a child with autism to eat food that causes them discomfort. You presented the situation as your fault for \"giving in\" and doing the easy thing with food, but I suspect that you were also accommodating his comfort level with food. Don't punish him for his preferences. Even if it is not due to any sensory differences, which could.be true even without being on the spectrum, it is what he is familiar with, and comfortable with. \n\nAnother example, you suddenly moved to another country where all of the food is completely new to you. You are criticized for your bland taste buds and inflexibility by everyone around you. You don't just adapt to a whole new flavor palate over night. Why are you expecting your son to?\n\nThank your fiance for cooking, eat and enjoy his food, and cook separate meals yourself for your son. Acclimate him gradually to the new flavors and textures.\nSay  he only has to taste every thing else at the table, but he doesn't have to eat it, one bite. My son was able to stretch his palate when he had very restricted food preferences by using this technique.\n\nMostly,  don't make food a chore or a punishment. Don't withhold food that he will eat. Don't shame your son for his understandable food preferences. You won't be making him a spoiled entitled child as many have suggested by accommodating his meals with some things that he does prefer to eat.", "Y\u2019all\u2026.the kid is 8 years old.

You introduce them to different foods slowly. Like mixing veggies into spaghetti sauce or into ketchup to get him to eat veggies with chicken nuggets. Disguise new food in with his safe foods.

Deadass chronically online.", "NTA.  \n\nIt's okay for your fiance to be frustrated that your son isn't eating his food but it's not okay for him to take it out on your son. Your son is a child who is dealing with a ton of change lending families and is also being asked to eat foods he is unfamiliar with at the whims of his new family member.  \n\nYou did not make him this way by feeding him chicken nuggets, you in fact gave him a secure and dependable upbringing where he could rely on you and rely on being fed familiar comforting foods which is what kids crave and flourish in.  All these foods your fiance is making are familiar and comforting for his kids so there is no fair comparison here. They are feeling secure with their dad and is cooking.\n\nPersonally, I would 1) let my fiance know that it is unacceptable to take his frustrations out on my child, that it is unacceptable to shame of my child for his limited palette, and that my child is not responsible for his feelings. 2) Serve chicken nuggets or a food that is comfortable for the sun with at EVERY meal.  It's unreasonable to expect your son to eat foods he is unfamiliar or uncomfortable with. You would not do this to a guest or a spouse and it's not reasonable to do it to a child. The typical advice with serving newer unfamiliar foods is to serve them alongside comfortable foods and at any meal should include things that you know the child will eat.  3) keep ingredients in new dishes available to eat separately new flavors and compositions without being served to the finished dish.  This will help make all of the parts and the finished dish become familiar.", "I remember that! That was on untold stories of the er", "I was thinking the same thing.
