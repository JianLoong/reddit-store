Seems like your guy is only interested in making exactly what he wants and demanding everyone around him like and appreciate it.  \n\nA kid that's only really used to eating nuggets and ramen is going to have a hard time with that.

This isn't about his delicious cooking, it's about your son having to accept a new way of eating. His previous diet was setting him up for health problems and bad habits, no judgment, I know it can be hard. However, you have a great guy who   cooks what you can't/haven't learned yet, so definitely appreciate that. You need to do some negotiating with your son, like Mon-Frid healthy meals and maybe Saturday is nuggets. He'll come round eventually, but you have to be firm and calm.

There are creative ways you can make new food fun, and make compromises so over time he can adjust more comfortably. For your fianc\u00e9\u2019s part he should also be more understanding, and jumping to this extreme of no longer cooking for your household is insensitive, immature, and will only make it harder for your son to adjust.

You need to remember your son needs your support and punishing him for not eating your boyfriends food or whinging is not on.

But there are ways to compromise for a picky eater without making a whole new meal. \n\nFor example.. spaghetti and meatballs. My son will eat noodles, but he will not do chunky sauce. He\u2019s okay with shitty marinara or Alfredo sauce, but good, thick red sauce is not cool. We just portion out some noodles and throw butter and Parmesan on there. Enchiladas? We put the chicken and cheese inside and melt cheese on top without the sauce.

Even now with most dinners being just myself and the kids, he eats what we do with just a slight modification. It doesn\u2019t take much extra effort. Mostly just one extra pan to wash.\n\nEdited to add: I have always done the taste it rule. Typically, if there is a sauce involved, I make it separately but he has to try at least one bite of everything new. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he doesn\u2019t have to eat it but he has to at least try.

If you prepare their plates, then you prepare his with his safe food and a new food. If you set the table and allow them to serve themselves, then you should place his safe option on the table with everything else. You don't force him to eat anything he doesn't want to eat, there will be no bartering, and no rewards or punishments for mealtime. You can ask him if he wants to try something, but allow him the space to choose whether or not he will. When you encourage, it should not be pushy. And no one makes negative comments about anyone's food choices. That means you must also teach your son not to speak negatively of your fianc\u00e9's cooking, not every thought needs to be said out loud.\n\nHopefully this will allow your son to be more open to trying new foods, when he's ready. Mealtimes can still be had together, and still be a family event. No one has to feel bad about their dinner. Your son can develop healthy relationships with food, and not go to bed hungry which is arguably worse for his growing little body than macaroni and chicken nuggets for dinner.\n\nTell your fianc\u00e9 that you're sorry, and that you've been frustrated too, you're going to work more on teaching your son to not be rude about his cooking. Let him know that you love his food, but you won't force him to cook for either of you if he truly doesn't want to. But suggest to him that you would still like to have meal times together because it's a great family bonding time, and that you will be responsible for cooking safe options for your son and allowing him to choose what he eats. That because fed is best, this is more about teaching him to be open to trying new things by providing them as an option, because forcing it is more likely to result in negative associations and a lot of push back. \n\nLet's be honest, if forcing it was going to work, it would have worked by now.

All options are suitable for a healthy, varied diet, so no pasta if we had pasta recently.\n- The child is expected to eat a little of everything, and at least try new foods. Sometimes there are many small plates on the table, in which case she doesn't have to eat some of everything, but she can sample anything.\n- We don't forbid sweets but do insist on varying a sweet dessert with a fruit dessert. Sometimes after eating dessert she goes back for more main course.\n- We don't talk about good foods and bad foods but do talk about recommended amounts of different foods in a varied diet.

Even at this age, I will literally vomit because I can't just bear to eat them. Please take a consultation and try to see if there is some underlying medical condition that affects his behavior. Also, hold hope. With age, things do change a bit. For all my aversions, I will wolf down a nicely prepared bitter gourd dish, love dried fenugreek in my food and in general enjoy far more flavors than my family does.

This way he has a sense of control over what he\u2019s eating and he can better inspect it before trying.  As an adult, I realized a lot of my issues with food had to do with the texture, and not the actual taste.  Maybe try explaining textures to him and help him recognize how different foods feel inside his mouth.  You could start with foods he likes and is comfortable with.  Have him slowly eat a bite, noting if the food feels crunchy or squishy, it it\u2019s salty or sweet, etc.  Then ask how that food made him feel.  I think helping him identify his triggers could help him feel more comfortable with new food and give him a sense of control when he gets nervous.

No one tolerated \u2018pickiness\u2019 mainly because money was tight, parenting was definitely unhelpfully strict but also no one knew about eating disorders or food intolerances.

And it has been found that it can take 10-15 tries to learn if a new food/combination is liked.\n\nSo yeah, let\u2019s let the 8 year old with no palate, he\u2019ll no experience with other food drive what menus for everyone else\u2019s.  I mean who give a duck if they may or may not like chicken nuggets every night.", "Exactly if OP wanted help or advice she wouldve used an advice subreddit. AITA is for validation mainly. YTA for letting your son be so disrespectful to your partner when your partner cooks for son. \n\nIf you really need to find advice seek an advice sub on reddit or better you seek professional help.

While my kids are not picky, they also arent adventurous either. Which is fine. I try to cook a variety of food with everybody's preferences considered.

I, however, feel like making kids eat things they don't like IS abuse. \n\nNo one threatens to starve you as an adult because you don't like certain foods. \n\nIt has taken me years of therapy to realize that it's okay to stop when I'm full rather than when my plate is clean.

He was perfectly willing to cook for you and your son, it\u2019s that the two of you shit on him so much that he\u2019s giving up.  Don\u2019t play the victim here, nobody is buying the bullshit you\u2019re shoveling.", "I think you should stop catering to your child.", "Not a bad idea at all. Schools do it and give children a time limit. Children need routine but the key is to give them a heads up and make them part of the process, for example, \u201cI\u2019m going to start making dinner can you help me.\u201d Or \u201cwe\u2019re going to eat dinner in 10 minutes can you come set the table.\u201d The key to eating at home is to lead by example so when its time for a meal you sit down with your children and eat. Depict the behaviour you wish to see and they will mirror. \n\nEdit: Also forgot to add, if he\u2019s picky and complains don\u2019t play into it. Often times children are looking to get a reaction from you. Address the positive changes in celebration and ignore/ re-route the negative. For example if he says \u201cI want chicken nuggets\u201d you could respond with mirroring the behaviour you wish to see by thanking your partner out loud infront of your child for the lovely meal that they prepared for you and your son, eating it and then making a positive comment about how delicious it is \u201cwow this tastes so much better than chicken nuggets!\u201d And if he refuses to eat let him leave the table. Don\u2019t throw out his plate of food. If he complains he\u2019s hungry before the next meal/snack time warm up the meal from his plate for him to eat. You can still have a graze, it\u2019s more about having specified times to start a meal and teaching your child that if they are hungry that is the only option."]}
