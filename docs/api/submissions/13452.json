Seems like your guy is only interested in making exactly what he wants and demanding everyone around him like and appreciate it.  \n\nA kid that's only really used to eating nuggets and ramen is going to have a hard time with that.

This isn't about his delicious cooking, it's about your son having to accept a new way of eating. His previous diet was setting him up for health problems and bad habits, no judgment, I know it can be hard. However, you have a great guy who   cooks what you can't/haven't learned yet, so definitely appreciate that. You need to do some negotiating with your son, like Mon-Frid healthy meals and maybe Saturday is nuggets. He'll come round eventually, but you have to be firm and calm.

There are creative ways you can make new food fun, and make compromises so over time he can adjust more comfortably. For your fianc\u00e9\u2019s part he should also be more understanding, and jumping to this extreme of no longer cooking for your household is insensitive, immature, and will only make it harder for your son to adjust.

You need to remember your son needs your support and punishing him for not eating your boyfriends food or whinging is not on.

But there are ways to compromise for a picky eater without making a whole new meal. \n\nFor example.. spaghetti and meatballs. My son will eat noodles, but he will not do chunky sauce. He\u2019s okay with shitty marinara or Alfredo sauce, but good, thick red sauce is not cool. We just portion out some noodles and throw butter and Parmesan on there. Enchiladas? We put the chicken and cheese inside and melt cheese on top without the sauce.

Even now with most dinners being just myself and the kids, he eats what we do with just a slight modification. It doesn\u2019t take much extra effort. Mostly just one extra pan to wash.\n\nEdited to add: I have always done the taste it rule. Typically, if there is a sauce involved, I make it separately but he has to try at least one bite of everything new. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he doesn\u2019t have to eat it but he has to at least try.

If you prepare their plates, then you prepare his with his safe food and a new food. If you set the table and allow them to serve themselves, then you should place his safe option on the table with everything else. You don't force him to eat anything he doesn't want to eat, there will be no bartering, and no rewards or punishments for mealtime. You can ask him if he wants to try something, but allow him the space to choose whether or not he will. When you encourage, it should not be pushy. And no one makes negative comments about anyone's food choices. That means you must also teach your son not to speak negatively of your fianc\u00e9's cooking, not every thought needs to be said out loud.\n\nHopefully this will allow your son to be more open to trying new foods, when he's ready. Mealtimes can still be had together, and still be a family event. No one has to feel bad about their dinner. Your son can develop healthy relationships with food, and not go to bed hungry which is arguably worse for his growing little body than macaroni and chicken nuggets for dinner.\n\nTell your fianc\u00e9 that you're sorry, and that you've been frustrated too, you're going to work more on teaching your son to not be rude about his cooking. Let him know that you love his food, but you won't force him to cook for either of you if he truly doesn't want to. But suggest to him that you would still like to have meal times together because it's a great family bonding time, and that you will be responsible for cooking safe options for your son and allowing him to choose what he eats. That because fed is best, this is more about teaching him to be open to trying new things by providing them as an option, because forcing it is more likely to result in negative associations and a lot of push back. \n\nLet's be honest, if forcing it was going to work, it would have worked by now.

All options are suitable for a healthy, varied diet, so no pasta if we had pasta recently.\n- The child is expected to eat a little of everything, and at least try new foods. Sometimes there are many small plates on the table, in which case she doesn't have to eat some of everything, but she can sample anything.\n- We don't forbid sweets but do insist on varying a sweet dessert with a fruit dessert.

Even at this age, I will literally vomit because I can't just bear to eat them. Please take a consultation and try to see if there is some underlying medical condition that affects his behavior. Also, hold hope. With age, things do change a bit. For all my aversions, I will wolf down a nicely prepared bitter gourd dish, love dried fenugreek in my food and in general enjoy far more flavors than my family does.

I made her some cod fried in butter and she LOVED it!", "Please tell me you\u2019re joking", "Like someone else said, make him try a few bites and if he doesn\u2019t like it, let him make himself a PB&J. Don\u2019t use hunger as a punishment, children shouldn\u2019t go hungry.", "When growing up, the rule at our house was you eat what was served or you could make a PB&J or a tuna sandwich. However, if it was a new dish, we were required to take three bites before being allowed the sandwich option.", "Make yourself a sandwich is the go-to I've heard", "Good heavens! No wonder he's a picky eater. He knows that he'll eventually get what he wants and he has all your attention too. i'd drop dessert (actually for everyone except once a week or special occasions). I wouldn't be limiting snacks, they'd be eliminated. We don't have snacks at our house other than fresh fruit.", "\"we tried nothing and are out of ideas\"", "This is the best option. I don\u2019t think going hungry should be an option for a child. Make them try it, then they can make a sandwich if they don\u2019t like it.", "I had a very similar upbringing and it was called the \u201cno thank you bites\u201d. It definitely expanded our pallets and removed any picky eating habits.", "You said you don\u2019t know how to cook. I\u2019m assuming nuggets, boxed mac and cheese and ramen are your go to", "Not spoiling him by giving him sweets or a pre-dinner snack. You're giving more attention to the problem than it warrants. Your son is a picky eater because that's how you trained him. He's becoming a spoiled brat.\n\nSimply set him at the table. He can eat what is served or he can simply sit there. Your attitude should simply be 'this is dinner, deal with it'. After dinner the food is put away and there is nothing available (no ramen or nuggets) until the next morning. He will not starve skipping dinner. Alternately, since he is 8 and old enough, he can make himself dinner after everyone else eats. Or he can be cook's assistant (chopping onions, grabbing spices, cleaning little messes) so he has an appreciation for how food is prepared and may be more willing to try what he has a hand in cooking. Make sure to have none of his favorites (nuggets & ramen) in the house. At least until he is eating regularly with family.\n\nETA: YTA, this is a problem you have inadvertently created and you need to correct this.", "You should learn how to cook actual meals"]}
