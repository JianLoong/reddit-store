Your $50k is 30% of the total, his $114 is 70%. Therefore, you should reasonably be expected to pay 30% of all the household expenses - rent, insurance, utilities, general groceries, etc - and he pays the remaining 70%\n\nEach of you pay your own individual expenses - car, clothing, specialty groceries, etc.", "NTA don't move in with him", "INFO: Was this not discussed before this point? How do you guys currently pay for expenses together like dinner/outings etc?", "NAH.  You have different expectations in what is fair.  You are basing it on proportion of income, he is basing it on splitting common costs evenly.", "NAH. You two have a communication problem, i'm guessing that he asked for half because he knows how much you make and knows that you can afford it (Doubt that half is 50k+ a year), but paying half is no good for you because you would be left with too little (Which is valid).\n\nInvite him to move in with you instead, that way you can afford to pay half or just break up.\n\n>I told him he's being rather cheap\n\n\"I'm going to pay as much as you\" is not cheap, it's fair, the only way in which it would not be fair would be if he would consume more than you, that way it would be unequal since you would be paying for his expenses.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nYou should determine what your budget is and tell him this is what you can afford to pay.\n\nIf he wants everything to be equal, then you double your max budget. Just because he earns more doesn't mean he is obligated to pay more. However, he should not force you to spend more than what you can afford.\n\nIf he wants a more expensive property, then he should pay the difference between what you can afford to pay and the total cost.\n\nIf he doesn't like either of these options, you shouldn't move in together.", "NTA.

He sucks for not grasping that your income, and hence spending power, is substantially less than his. You suck because you said that he pays for everything right now, and you're cool with that. Both of you suck for not being able to have an adult conversation about how to proceed, especially when you are talking about a pretty significant life change for the two of you. \n\nI have lived both sides of your experience, I have had both very substantial savings and income and I have had rough patches in my life where my savings were wiped out, and my earnings were extremely limited.\n\nAt no point in any of that would I expect a partner to pay for all of our dates without contributing. There are a lot of options for the two of you to spend quality time on dates without spending a fortune, and you could very easily find some of those and treat him for a change.\n\nYes it's reasonable in my mind, for you to contribute less, since you can't afford to contribute more, but the impression that you are giving is that you are not actually interested in doing so, and would really rather that he pay for it all.", "Yta\n\nWas gonna say n a h until I see your reply where you called him cheap. \n\nNothing wrong with him wanting to go halves, and if the goal is long term you both eventually combining finances then it's all out of one big pot anyway.\n\nBut you calling him cheap makes it sound like (to me) that you are expecting to be taken care of, or feel that he owes more because he got a better job.", "INFO.  Can't judge this one as we only have half of the numbers.  It's not how much you earn, it's how much you have left after bills are paid.  I don't know your state tax situation.  But assuming no state tax, and if you live in the U.S., your take-home pay should be close to $3333 a month.  Generally, it's considered affordable to pay 25-30% of income on housing (RENT, or monthly payment).  Round that to $900 a month for your half of housing.  Other household expenses will be insignificant, next to rent.  \n\nSo...If rent at your new place will be $2000 a month or less, then I would say that's close enough to your budget that you should have nothing to complain about.  If you complain anyway, it would mean that you are (currently) living beneath your means.  And there's nothing wrong with wanting to keep that.  But it would mean not moving.\n\nBut let's say you are moving to a place that is $3000 a month or more.  Now it's not reasonable for you to pay half, as even half would exceed a reasonable budget for your own housing expense.  And again, it would mean that you are not moving.\n\nBut then I wouldn't call your boyfriend cheap for not offering to pay more than his half of the rent.  Because then you are asking your boyfriend to subsidize a better life-style for you, using his own money.  While he might be willing to do that, he's certainly under no obligation to do so.  And to NOT do so is not \"cheap\".  It's financially responsible.\n\nHe doesn't need to adopt you as a dependent to have you as a girlfriend.  Some guys might be willing to do that, but your guy isn't one of them.  And there is nothing right or wrong with that situation.", "NTA.\n\nIt would be a different story if y\u2019all earned around the same amount of money.

OP needs to come up with a hard maximum number for what she can comfortably spend on rent and utilities. If they find a place where 50% of expenses is less than that number, OP still pays 50%. If he wants a place where 50% of expenses is more than her maximum budget, then he pays everything over her maximum budget, even if that means he\u2019s covering much more of the expenses. If he can\u2019t agree to this, she should not be moving in with him. The situation should be exactly the same if the genders were reversed, for the record.", "If he insists on you paying half, despite your differences in income, then he\u2019s setting you up for financial abuse. He would absolutely be taking advantage of you whilst loudly proclaiming he doesn\u2019t want to be taken advantage of himself. We see it here all the time, the higher earner going on holidays the lower earner can\u2019t afford. Having no savings trying to keep up while their partners stuff their savings accounts. Going without just so they can pay their 50%.  \n\nI would not agree with anything that isn\u2019t *equitable* especially as he is trying to drive the decision on where you live. Calling you cheap is indicative of his materialistic nature, whereas you seem happy to be more frugal. It\u2019s that difference which will cause issues long term given he wants you to subsidise his lifestyle.", "NTA op. Completely agree. Finances, kids, religion, politics, any other important to you issues need to be discussed and on the same page before marriage, so the financial bit happening now is good. They should discuss equitable vs equal here, as he makes 2x, maybe she gives a third. Then as careers advance it can be reassessed.", "Honestly this:\n\n\"I pay for all my bills and whatnot, if I need extra money I do gig work or whatever I can. He said he doesn't like seeing me work that hard, so I stopped doing as much gig work because he said he would rather spend time with me than watch me work all the time.\"\n\nCombined with him complaining about you not wanting to spend as much money on living in an expensive area, is a gigantic waving red flag. \n\nThere are people who keep partners at a financial disadvantage, insist on the working less and insist they are happy to cover the difference, then use the financial disparity to make the partner feel obligated, less-than, ungrateful etc as a form of control. \n\nIt's a type of financial abuse. I. Not saying that's happening here. I'm just saying be wary of anyone who basically emotionally manipulates you into working less and then complains about you being careful with your money.", "NTA Do the math.. what will the new cost be as a percentage of your take home pay. Include raised utilities and commutes. If it  doesn't work for you, then take care of yourself. \n\n**Just say no, you will be house poor.**", "NTA and you're definitely not ready to move in together. Take your time and discuss this with calm and patience. It's you two against the problem (finding a way to live together), not you against him, as it currently sounds like from your post. There's no right or wrong way to handle this stuff. It's about what you're both comfortable with. If you can't reach an agreement, that's OK too, it means this move is not a good idea now.", "YTA and a red flag, you are effectively punishing him for earning more when you have separate finances", "NTA\n\nYou do an equity split based on your income. If your income is 25% of BF you pay 25% of living costs. This way you are under the same financial burden.\n\nIf your BF refuses this then he has to live  to your budget. A budget that includes you being able to save and have fun money each month. NOT YOU paying 90% living expenses.", "NTA - the fair thing is to split proportionally to income. If the total income is for example 1/3 from you and 2/3 from your bf, then you should pay 1/3 of expenses while he pays 2/3.\n\nThis is no joke if you can't come to an agreement. If he's being greedy and irrational about things, then that's your cue as to what life with him will be like and you should pay attention to it and not move in with him.", "NTA. He is. It sounds like he wants to put you under financial pressure by moving to a more expensive place and demanding that you pay half despite him earning more than twice his income. You will be forced to spend most of your income on bills and then be left with almost nothing. No savings or good quality personal items. Something is not right. You will be trapped", "Don't move in with him. If he can't see why it's illogical for you to each pay the same toward rent/utilities when he make TWICE what you do\\~don't move.\n\nIf you move, you will have given up the roommate & the place you can afford. If you move, he'll probably expect you to be head cook and cleaner, as well. And worst of all\\~you're strapped for $$ because HE wanted to live in an expensive area.\n\nStay where you are for now.", "YTA.  You are deliberately ruining your coming life by formalizing a relationship that is unfit for the purpose.  Hooking up with a selfish man, dating one while young is excusable, trying to turn this pig into a silk purse is an asshole move against your self.\n\nGet out there and get a good man, a generous man, a man that sees you, and not just his own self.  Selfish will only change if he sees a woman as so \"high value\" that he has too do more\\~\\~, and even then the change will be temporary.\\~\\~ for a while.  Is he seeing you as \"all that\"?\n\nPlease see the future selfish is really offering you.  The one where you do all the cleaning and  sex is on his demand.  That is the future he wants.  Until something better comes along.\n\nDo not go half on your one good life.  You deserve a whole life with a whole man.   Good luck.", "NTA. I'm all for going half when you're not married yet, but when one partner want something out of the other partners budget they have to step up", "NTA, there is two ways to deal with this he gets to choose where you live and it's split based on income or you can choose where you guys live and can split 50/50.", "NTA. You are being honest about what you can and can't afford. The fact that he is saying those things makes him the AH.", "NTA. If you go half, budget gets decided based on what the lower earner (you) is comfortable with. Since he wants a more expensive place, splitting half isn't fair, he should pay a larger share.", "Maybe NAH, but it depends. \n\nIf you want advice on finances between couples it's best to work out what percentage you bring to the relationship. You and your 50K, his 114K so the total household income of 164K which means you bring in about 30% so only 30% should be taken from you while he pays the other 60%. \n\nI thought this was how most people did it because no one ever makes the same.", "The consensus on similar posts is that things should be split proportionally depending on the disparity of your income, especially as it\u2019s him who wants to live in the higher cost of living area.", ">trying to make sure I was \"sure\" about my decision\n\nGotta tell you, having to reaffirm my decisions with people got really old, really fast.  I know my mind.\n\nNTA."]}
