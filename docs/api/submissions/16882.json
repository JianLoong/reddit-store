Huey Newton, an African American law student, helped found an organization called the Black Panthers, a group that advocated for the civil rights of Black Americans, sometimes in ways that were less peaceful than the approach Dr. Martin Luther King Jr took. At the time, police were frequently using violence to break up crowds of people protesting for Civil Rights- even peaceful and non-violent protestors were subject to being arrested, mobbed, attacked by police dogs, etc. It was a dangerous time. Since Newton was a law student, he began looking for legal ways to protect his community. He started researching the Second Amendment, which up to that point in US history was mostly ignored, and started telling members of the Black Panthers that they had the legal right to bear arms in public places.\n\nMembers of the Black Panthers started arming up and patrolling their neighborhoods, watching traffic stops conducted by white officers against Black drivers, and basically just showing their legal armed presence, to the white police officers, sort of a \"we're watching you, and we're prepared to intervene if you go too far\" statement. \n\nThis prompted a lot of gun control measures from frightened white politicians who tried to restrict access to/presence of guns, and led to the passage of the Mumford Act, which makes most public carrying of loaded guns illegal.\n\nA small group of American hunters started getting nervous that they wouldn't be able to keep their hunting rifles and whatnot, which prompted a change in leadership in an organization that was not particularly large at that time, the National Rifle Association. Previously the NRA was mostly concerned with hunting and making sure young men were trained in marksmanship in the event they were called into military service. The change in leadership switched the organization's focus to championing the Second Amendment and advocating for people to have the right to arm themselves for self defense and protection of property.\n\nTLDR no one gave a fuck about the Second Amendment until the Black Panthers started using it to guard against police brutality, white people freaked out, they tried to restrict access to guns, the NRA freaked out, and now we have what we have", "I saw a program on TV that ended up comparing the US and Canada, which have similar backgrounds and the same amount of guns.\n\nThe difference was fear.

I walk back and forth with my dog all the time, 20 minutes up the block then 20 minutes back.

Lady was polite and I told her I make my dog park it on the edge of the street when there\u2019s cars.  I don\u2019t like stressing about dogs when I drive, so I give others that courtesy.

You guys just walk on and off of each other's property as you please?", "Howdy, American (Texas) young adult here. Honestly I think the biggest reason is education and the educational system. Parents and other authority figures for children have absolutely no care about anyone else, maybe people are entitled and believe they should be exempt from all rules and are paranoid and fear being told they aren\u2019t exempt. The children grow up with this mindset and a mindset of \u201cno matter what I do I am invincible\u201d which leads to shootings especially in schools because people think their feelings and wants are the only important thing and that consequences aren\u2019t real. \nThe reality is that guns aren\u2019t going anywhere and every single politician in office has failed to properly address this issue. Guns aren\u2019t going anywhere, and even if somehow we managed to outlaw any kind of firearm (I agree there are some that should not be accessed by civilians), bad people WILL continue to get illegal guns (I know at least two people personally with them, one was a felon and couldn\u2019t have guns in their name and one has guns that are illegal to be civilian owned.) and they won\u2019t be stopped. That\u2019s why crimes are called crimes, laws will not stop bad people. \nThe educational system needs to be revamped, the parental and authoritative system needs to be restructured. We need to start raising a society that realized consequences are real and they HAVE to suffer those consequences. We need to raise a society that is sympathetic and understanding of others, one that thinks before it acts.\nKnives aren\u2019t blamed for stabbings, drugs and needles and bottles aren\u2019t blamed for overdoses, clothes aren\u2019t blamed for sexual assaults, guns shouldn\u2019t be blamed for shootings. Blame cannot and should not be removed from the person and attached to an object. People need to be held responsible for their actions and suffer their consequences. The people in charge of the educational system, that don\u2019t understand anything going on in schools, is failing our society at our core, our children.", "When people are angry and guns are available, people use them. Same reason people get shot in the home, during arguments. It's not just mass shootings.

A healthy reaction to seeing that might be to think \u201coh there\u2019s my neighbor walking the dog in that weird way again.\u201d But instead he sees you as a psycho and is treating this like a problem that needs to be addressed. It\u2019s very telling that finds it entitled for you to just occupy public space near him.\n\nIt feels like people\u2019s ability to assess threats has gotten way out of sync as a collective paranoia has settled over a lot of people due to ring and fear mongering media.
