Huey Newton, an African American law student, helped found an organization called the Black Panthers, a group that advocated for the civil rights of Black Americans, sometimes in ways that were less peaceful than the approach Dr. Martin Luther King Jr took. At the time, police were frequently using violence to break up crowds of people protesting for Civil Rights- even peaceful and non-violent protestors were subject to being arrested, mobbed, attacked by police dogs, etc. It was a dangerous time. Since Newton was a law student, he began looking for legal ways to protect his community. He started researching the Second Amendment, which up to that point in US history was mostly ignored, and started telling members of the Black Panthers that they had the legal right to bear arms in public places.\n\nMembers of the Black Panthers started arming up and patrolling their neighborhoods, watching traffic stops conducted by white officers against Black drivers, and basically just showing their legal armed presence, to the white police officers, sort of a \"we're watching you, and we're prepared to intervene if you go too far\" statement. \n\nThis prompted a lot of gun control measures from frightened white politicians who tried to restrict access to/presence of guns, and led to the passage of the Mumford Act, which makes most public carrying of loaded guns illegal.\n\nA small group of American hunters started getting nervous that they wouldn't be able to keep their hunting rifles and whatnot, which prompted a change in leadership in an organization that was not particularly large at that time, the National Rifle Association. Previously the NRA was mostly concerned with hunting and making sure young men were trained in marksmanship in the event they were called into military service. The change in leadership switched the organization's focus to championing the Second Amendment and advocating for people to have the right to arm themselves for self defense and protection of property.\n\nTLDR no one gave a fuck about the Second Amendment until the Black Panthers started using it to guard against police brutality, white people freaked out, they tried to restrict access to guns, the NRA freaked out, and now we have what we have", "I saw a program on TV that ended up comparing the US and Canada, which have similar backgrounds and the same amount of guns.\n\nThe difference was fear.
