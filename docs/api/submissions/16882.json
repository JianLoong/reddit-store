Imagine continual msgs from ring doorbell saying someone is there or if he has a pet that detects your presence & is going wild inside the house \n\nBut regardless you have a right to walk where you want as long as it isnt disturbing the peace.

We also pick up poop, but sometimes they pee on others' lawns. It's kind of unpreventable.\n\nIf you are pacing in front of his house only (which it sounds like you are not) then, yeah - that's weird. \n\nHas there been bad blood before? Something that would make him think you are only selecting his house?\n\nSounds like he's got a turgid, raging, rage boner and just wants to be the old man who yells at kids to get off his lawn.
