I said he doesn't own the street, but I will keep my dog out of his yard if that is his concern. He said what I'm doing is harassment. I rolled my eyes and said he was being an idiot. He called me an entitled asshole. So that ended that conversation and any chance of a fond neighborly relationship.\n\nObviously, I shouldn't have called him an idiot.

He IS an idiot, BUT he sounds bizarre and I would be careful he doesn\u2019t escalate this to hurt your dog or cause you problems.", "NTA\n\nIt's just like someone exercising in the morning. He doesn't own the sidewalk or the street and you're free to walk where you want when you want. Can you avoid his house though?", "NTA\nIt is 5 AM and you are walking your dog in your own neighborhood. You aren\u2019t doing anything to him or his property.", "NTA, streets and sidewalks are public. Unless you're going out of your way to like yell stuff at them then it's not even a maybe disorderly or disturbing the peace. I'd tell them to call the cops if they want and let them explain to the neighbour that you can walk around all you want.", "NTA, why is he up at 5 AM watching what you're doing outside anyway, not like you're hanging out in his front lawn", "Did you tell him WHY you were only walking out front like that? And he STILL had an issue? NTA as he may need a medical eval if he fails to see the importance of keeping your home in sight", "NTA\n\n\nHe needs to get over himself", "NTA You\u2019re not doing anything wrong as long as you\u2019re not on his property. You shouldn\u2019t have called him an idiot though. (Although I do understand the sentiment).", "NTA and you already know it.", "I feel like there is something left out here. OP said she'd keep her dog out of the neighbour's yard. Does that mean the dog is just roaming around, running into other people's yards? If so, I can see why that can get annoying. I wouldn't want a dog kicking around my yard every morning at 5am. \n\nOn the other hand, if it's just a quiet walk with the dog on the leash and making zero noise, it's the neighbour who needs to chill.", "NTA for walking on the street in front of your house at 5am because your son is asleep in your house & you need to keep an eye on the house .\n\nHowever, a couple of questions, is your neighbor's house especially close to the sidewalk?  And does your neighbor have cameras that alert him to you walking by or any pets that are reactive?  If any of those answers are yes, it makes sense why he is a bit annoyed.  Imagine continual msgs from ring doorbell saying someone is there or if he has a pet that detects your presence & is going wild inside the house \n\nBut regardless you have a right to walk where you want as long as it isnt disturbing the peace.  I don't think you should tell your neighbor WHY you are walking in the manner you are.  If he is vindictive he may call CPS or police & tell them you are leaving the child alone everyday at 5 am.", "NTA. You have every right to walk on public property. Your neighbor has no say in it.", "NTA. Your neighbour doesn\u2019t own the road.  But a better conversation was needed with neighbour.", "NTA - It ain't harassment if you aren't directing anything towards his house.", "Info-does your dog bark or is it loud during your walks?", "NTA\n\nYou're not going inside his house or even his lawn. He's just being a dick for the sake of it.\n\nYou have every right to walk your dog however you see fit.", "Why shouldn\u2019t you have called him an idiot? You are walking a dog not and live close by. Can\u2019t he add two and two?", "Weird person.", "NTA for the walking. You\u2019re right in that you are allowed to walk in front of your own house. I would understand if he didn\u2019t know you and just thought it was a random guy but that\u2019s not the case. You are both the AH for handling that conversation so poorly however.", "LMAO??? NTA this guy is crazy. Let him call the cops about it. Sidewalks and streets are public.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.  But you might want to talk to the police.  In case he escalates.", "NTA. Your doin nothing wrong by walking any which way on your street as long as u arent holding up traffic. Id get some security cameras tho and set them up wherever your dog might spend outside alone time.   Id be worried neighbour would escalate behaviour into hurting puppersnoot.  \n\nNow show us the puppy tax. Lol", "NTA.\n\nThis is not harassment and your neighbour IS being an idiot about it. If your dog is barking loudly or something I can understand the frustration, but from how it sounds he's just ticked off that you happen to be walking near his home.\n\nWhy is he choosing to wake up at 5AM just to be a hater?", "NTA, if he confronts you again he will be psychic, because it will be harassment.  Keep being you. Tell him to get a hobby", "NTA.\n\nIf you are walking on a sidewalk and make multiple excursions in front of his house while you also walk in front of others (including yours), definitely NTA. You have a valid reason and he doesn't own the sidewalk. I would keep the dog off his lawn, though. \n\nI know what you mean about dogs and lawns - we walk ours on the sidewalk (leashed) and they will stray a foot or three onto lawns we pass. We also pick up poop, but sometimes they pee on others' lawns. It's kind of unpreventable.\n\nIf you are pacing in front of his house only (which it sounds like you are not) then, yeah - that's weird. \n\nHas there been bad blood before? Something that would make him think you are only selecting his house?\n\nSounds like he's got a turgid, raging, rage boner and just wants to be the old man who yells at kids to get off his lawn. The \"idiot\" probably didn't help matters much, but I would be in the moment as well and probably would have done the same thing. He definitely sound like an idiot.\n\nDon't overthink it - you can live next to assholes and not have them live in your head.", "NTA and WT actual F.", "NTA, lol I mean maybe the first time I saw it I would be a little perplexed if it looked as strange to me as it apparently does in his eyes. Then ask if everything was ok if i was truly concerned or you appeared distraught. You aren't hurting anything and not causing any mayhem so it's no one's business.", "NTA and he doesn\u2019t own the streeet.\n\nBut I hope he isn\u2019t armed.", "NTA, neighbor is overstepping his authority", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are being responsible by not wanting to be too far from your own home with your child sleeping inside.  There is no winning with some people.", "NAH.  You have your reasons for walking where you are but in doing so you are looking like you are either stalking someone or evaluating houses for burglary. Unless all of the neighbors know what you are doing and why you are probably going to get the cops called on you once or twice.", "You've encountered the cousin of the twit who believes no one should park (on a public street) in front of their house. NTA. Not even an entitled one. \ud83d\ude09", "Tell him you'll report him as a Peeping Tom on Next-door bc he looks out the window all night", "NTA it's hilarious that he thinks someone is entitled for using public infrastructure.", "All of this and don\u2019t tell him your reasoning for only walking that little bit", "I totally agree. NTA OP, but on the top of my head I can think of not one but even two mass shooting events that started because of a neighbor conflict - one of them extremely recently in Texas because someone asked their neighbor nicely not to shoot their AR15 in the front yard because their baby was sleeping, which lead to multiple people being murdered by the neighbor (including a child).\n\nIf you are in the US OP: at this point you just never know. I would stop walking in front of the neighbors house, because you don\u2019t know what kind of paranoia is going on for him, and if he has guns that he is willing to use on you if he \u201cfeels threatened\u201d.", "It's the third house down from mine and I don't want to go out of sight of my house.", "I know it's a well meaning suggestion but please OP do not call the cops or suggest your neighbor call the cops to settle this disagreement.   \n\n\nI see this suggestion often on this subreddit and frankly it makes me anxious b/c there are so many stories about situations escalating -- sometimes really badly -- when the cops get involved in nonviolent and often noncriminal disputes.   \n\n\nYes, call the cops if this neighbor threatens or assaults you or your dog, but not to settle an argument about what's allowed or not allowed.", "I don\u2019t think he told the neighbour why. I think OP is NTA but if he explained the neighbour would likely be more understanding.", "Like most dogs, he likes to walk into the grass, smell things, pee and poop on it. I always pick up his poop, but some people don't want dogs on their lawn, period, and I can respect that. I wouldn't call that roaming though. He's on a leash right next to me.", "I wouldn't say especially close. None of us have much in the way of front yards. I have never heard barking coming from his house or seen him walking a pet, but I can't be certain. As to ring doorbells, I would have no way of knowing that.", "No, he mostly just sniffs things, pees and poops.", "Geez, stuff is kinda grim over there huh?", "Don't forget the guy who shot a woman dead because her dog pooped when she walked it past his house.", ">fond neighborly relationship\n\nNTA and I doubt you were going to have a good neighbor relationship with someone who is going to hassle you about walking up and down the sidewalk, minding your own business.  \n\n\nAnd you don't have to offer any explanation because you don't have to explain yourself to them for walking on a public sidewalk or street.", "Can you cross the street while passing this fool's house?", "I was just saying I'd do that. But I'm me. I've had a neighbour call 3 times in a day on me for music in my yard and each time they did nothing because it wasn't a problem. I didn't suggest that OP call, but rather I'd personally mock the person. Also, I'm sorta an asshole."]}
