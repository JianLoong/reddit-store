Stepmom is just being passive aggressive. She doesn't care that Good Dad is showering his kid as long as her ridiculously interfering mother doesn't know about it.  Everyone sucks here by OP and of course his daughter.", "Aside from her inappropriate accusation of creepiness, she is disregarding your daughter\u2019s autonomy as a disabled girl. \n\nI was disabled as a teenager and yes, it is a big risk factor for abuse but that means it is even more important you and your wife continue to listen to your daughter\u2019s verbal and non verbal cues about her body. \n\nDisabled kids often have less clear control over how their body is treated and have to have \u2018unwanted\u2019 touch as part of treatment. It leaves them conflicted about boundaries and their own body very often especially combined with puberty.\n\nHelping them advocate for agreeing to personal care, not boundary stomping what they reasonably ask for, respecting their judgement and acknowledging any conflicting feelings about things like having to be dressed but finding it upsetting actually really help adjust to living with a disability and to make them safer to people who may try to abuse a more vulnerable more confused child.\n\nYou are not only not creepy but you are modelling to your kid how she has the ability to consent and teaching her incredibly valuable things about her body as a self, a sexual self and a medical concept. My family did not do these things and I was SA when older and struggled massively with medical trauma because I had no idea I could advocate for my care when I got older. I ended up in situations where medical professionals restrained against my will rather than listen because my PTSD caused freeze reactions they saw as \u2018non compliant.\u2019\n\nI am in my 40s and only realised in the last 2 years I have medical consent. But I learned by doctors ignoring me to the point they almost killed me due to medical neglect in the pandemic. When I saw a lawyer their first question was \u2018did you say no and ask for another option?\u2019 My first response was \u2018I did not know I could. No one has ever told me I was allowed.\u2019 I felt so stupid but those indirect ableist messages of \u2018does she take sugar\u2019 or seeing disabled people (especially AFAB) as not knowing their minds is damaging in so many ways. \n\nA lot of sick kids develop eating disorders or self harming behaviours too if they are not given a sense of bodily autonomy when their body is essentially already gaslighting them. That is a very very difficult thing to grasp as a kid and your MIL wants you to make it harder and more scary because she has problematic beliefs on many levels.\n\nYou are doing fantastically and as a care giving parent you need support as that is tough as hell in itself. Your MIL is harming your whole family unit including another kids by making a scene over something that is already big enough. This is very much a hill to die on for layers of reasons beyond \u2018just\u2019 the creepy comment.\n\nNTA. Also when you are sick or injured and you feel up to a shower you have to do it because you never know when you will be again. I\u2019ve dithered and ended up having to wait another *month*.
