Everyone sucks here by OP and of course his daughter.", "Aside from her inappropriate accusation of creepiness, she is disregarding your daughter\u2019s autonomy as a disabled girl. \n\nI was disabled as a teenager and yes, it is a big risk factor for abuse but that means it is even more important you and your wife continue to listen to your daughter\u2019s verbal and non verbal cues about her body. \n\nDisabled kids often have less clear control over how their body is treated and have to have \u2018unwanted\u2019 touch as part of treatment. It leaves them conflicted about boundaries and their own body very often especially combined with puberty.\n\nHelping them advocate for agreeing to personal care, not boundary stomping what they reasonably ask for, respecting their judgement and acknowledging any conflicting feelings about things like having to be dressed but finding it upsetting actually really help adjust to living with a disability and to make them safer to people who may try to abuse a more vulnerable more confused child.\n\nYou are not only not creepy but you are modelling to your kid how she has the ability to consent and teaching her incredibly valuable things about her body as a self, a sexual self and a medical concept. My family did not do these things and I was SA when older and struggled massively with medical trauma because I had no idea I could advocate for my care when I got older. I ended up in situations where medical professionals restrained against my will rather than listen because my PTSD caused freeze reactions they saw as \u2018non compliant.\u2019\n\nI am in my 40s and only realised in the last 2 years I have medical consent. But I learned by doctors ignoring me to the point they almost killed me due to medical neglect in the pandemic. When I saw a lawyer their first question was \u2018did you say no and ask for another option?\u2019 My first response was \u2018I did not know I could. No one has ever told me I was allowed.\u2019 I felt so stupid but those indirect ableist messages of \u2018does she take sugar\u2019 or seeing disabled people (especially AFAB) as not knowing their minds is damaging in so many ways. \n\nA lot of sick kids develop eating disorders or self harming behaviours too if they are not given a sense of bodily autonomy when their body is essentially already gaslighting them. That is a very very difficult thing to grasp as a kid and your MIL wants you to make it harder and more scary because she has problematic beliefs on many levels.\n\nYou are doing fantastically and as a care giving parent you need support as that is tough as hell in itself. Your MIL is harming your whole family unit including another kids by making a scene over something that is already big enough. This is very much a hill to die on for layers of reasons beyond \u2018just\u2019 the creepy comment.\n\nNTA.

Keep on", "Your kid asked for your help. She obviously trusts you and is comfortable enough with you (and feeling uncomfortably gross after not showering for days). Her call. End of story. NTA", "NTA. Its your daughter and she said it is okay for her.", "NTA your daughter was given options and she chose for you to help. MIL is probably mad that your daughter chose you (her actual parent) over her (her step grandmother)", "NTA.  She is TA for sexualising essential care for someone who is physically incapacitated.", "Definitely NTA.\nEspecially since you gave her options and she chose your help.\n\nYour MIL has some serious issues, that she automatically makes this a sexual thing instead of a loving parent thing.", "NTA! She is came from you, how is it wrong for you to help your child? \n\nThe only reason to think it is inappropriate is if one has wildly inappropriate thoughts oneself.", "NTA - Your daughter asked for your help. I was in a similar situation. Broke my leg, mom wasn't at home. It was only natural for me to ask my dad for help. He put me in the tub, washed my hair and back (bc i had to sit in an uncomfortable position to not get the cast wet so it was too difficult for me to wash myself all on my own) If you can't trust your own parents that is sad. What did MIL think you would do? Assault your own 14yo daughter? Sounds to me that your daughter is absolutely ok with you helping and that is more important than what MIL THINKS is appropriate or not. Would be another story if your daughter don't want you seeing her naked (well she could put a bathing suit on)", "Nta - it\u2019s weird for the parent or child to see each other naked at first but when someone you love is hurt you push past it. If either of my parents needed help I would be there for them as weird as it would be .", "NTA.  Your MIL is making it weird in her own mind.\n\nYou were acting as your daughter\u2019s caretaker.  Part of that is making sure her needs are met.  She specifically asked you to help her shower.  Only a pervert would make something out of that.\n\nMy (44f) father (74m) has Alzheimer\u2019s.  My mother and I want to keep him home as long as we can.  I know the day is fast approaching when I will have to help my mom help my dad with daily tasks, probably including showering.  It\u2019s just part of the job as caretaker.", "Your MIL is a creep, you are great for helping your daughter and for creating an environment where she feels secure enough to ask for your help. Jeeez, the MIL could have offered to help herself if she feels so strongly about it. But probably the daughter would not want help from a creep :)", "NTA. You're her father helping her,if MIL thinks there's weird stuff happening,thats a her problem. I do get it raises some eyebrows,but I dont see it as a big deal.", "NTA\n\nMIL might be helping but needs to butt off. Isbyour daughter choice. Humans and their weirdness, looks like she is  the only one with inappropriate thoughts about this all situation.", "NTA\n\nWtf, you are her father, she was asked beforehand and agreed! Where the heck is the problem? She had various options and chose the one she was most happy with.", "NTA.  Your MIL needs to get a fucking grip, her implication here is disgusting.  If your daughter's comfortable with it, she has literally no right to an opinion.  There's nothing creepy or sexual about helping *your child* to *bathe.*", "NTA. Sexualizing a dad helping his daughter take care of herself is really gross. (Besides, you've literally bathed her before, as well as wiped her butt, changed her diaper...)", "NTA, you're her dad, she chose you as the person she was most comfortable with helping her. Your daughter is the only one whose opinion matters in this scenario.", "Victim of a severe motorcycle accident here. Took 14 surgeries to fix 11 broken bones and various other internal injuries. Despite the fact that I have been a fiercely independent person since childhood, I spent months not only been bathed by family members, but cleaned after using a bedpan as well. it is a humbling experience, for sure, but all it shows is who loves you, and is willing to step up to care for you when you are in need. \n\nNTA dad. Keep up the great work.", "NTA. you're doing a beautiful thing for your daughter, and I'm sure it's not easy for you. It was her choice, she had the option of saying no and waiting for step-mom but she was happy to go ahead. You don't mention if she keeps underwear on when you help her shower, which is also an option but ultimately as long as you are both comfortable with it. \n\nWell done for being so involved in her care after her injury, it must have been a traumatic time for everyone.", "NTA\nDaughter said ok. She trusts you. When a person is sick/injured they just need help. \nNothing sexual about it.", "NTA, why is your MIL dictating your household?", "MIL watched too much SVU.  NTA!", "NTA\n\nThere's no problem with your caring for your daughter, same as if you needed help when you're elderly there'd be no problem with your daughter caring for you.\n\nYour MIL may be horrified to discover that some caregivers are men.", "Tell your Mother in Law that it was your daughter's choice, that you respect your kid's choice, and that it's really none of her damn business. If she is *soo* concerned, she should have been helping her herself instead of complaining and ruining everyone's day even more.", "NTA. You wife seems opposed to this only because she doesn\u2019t want o hear her mother complaining about it? Both your wife and MIL are the assholes here, and your wife needs to do more to stop your MIL interfering  and sexualising your injured daughter", "NTA what is gross is MIL sexualizing the situation.", "NTA. Your MIL needs to be welcomed into 2023 where dads are more active participants in your child\u2019s care. \nI would be very blunt with her. She should never make you feel like you\u2019re inappropriate with your child for basic caregiving. If she can\u2019t handle it she needs to stay elsewhere.", "NTA because she is your daughter who requested your assistance and who clearly trusts you to care for her when showering.\n\nYou didn\u2019t give much information about her injuries or where you\u2019re located, but have you heard of long handled aids? \nThey might help her achieve a little more independence, even if she still needs assistance with most of her showering.", "NTA\n\nParents and children help each other. \nAnd while I haven't been in a situation where I needed my parent's help to shower, my parent has. Both my brother and I have done it for our mother in the past, it wasn't gross, it wasn't inappropriate, it was simply helping somebody with their hygiene when they couldn't help themselves. You can't always wait for the next day or hell, even a few hours, because they're hurt and have a right to feel decent. \n\nI know damn well that if I got seriously injured and my husband wasn't around, my brother (we don't have a dad lol) would help me with basic hygiene tasks if I truly needed the help. Because family helps family when they can. I'd do the same if he was injured and truly needed the help and nobody else could. \n\nYou gave your daughter choices and she chose you, that says enough. She trusts you to take care of her, to love her even when she feels like a burden, to help her in her time of need, and that's not something she'll ever forget. Your mil is WAY out of line. As a mother, I truly hope I have a relationship with my son like that, because knowing that he trusts me that much, means that I'd have done a good job in raising him.", "STOP SEXUALIZING CHILDREN WTF  \nnot a father but i would 100% help my daughter or son out if need be and NOT THINK ABOUT ANYTHING INAPROPRIATE \n\nomg this infuriates me -.-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan we PLEASE normalize fathers being fathers? like i have seen so many fathers that brought  or got their kids from shool and they were laughed at or worse because \"Man need to work \"and women have to have the \"good and lazy\" life WTF!\n\nthis are quotes not my taughts.", "NTA but also, why are so many adults centering their feelings instead of what the sick child needs? that's the fucked up part here.\n\n(edit for typo)", "Nta", "Americans are so weird, its ur daughter.....", "You are NOT the asshole. It\u2019s a shame that in our world today a father has to be careful of perceptions like these. Tell your MIL to fuck off", "Are you an ah for taking care of your daughter? Absolutely not. Your MIL should mind her own business. There is nothing wrong with what you are doing. The older generation have taboos about that stuff. She means no harm but you should listen to your wife.", "In my 30s. My mum had back surgery earlier this year. \n\nHer stitches began just above her bum and she couldn't bend or move in certain ways. Siblings and i still changed every dressing and assisted with drying where necessary. \n\nSome jobs just need doing.", "Medical profession runs on consent, no reason your home cant either, NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA. She's got enough things to worry about without knowing MIL was being pervy. I had a grandmother sexualize me at that age and it did a lot of lasting damage. You're a good dad, protect her from that nonsense.", "NTA. Ask your wife why your daughter has to be punished for her inability to set boundaries with her own mother.", "From what I have read it doesn't sound like she is implying abuse. MIL is saying she thinks it is inappropriate for a father to see his teenager daughter naked and help her shower. Nothing more nothing less.\n\nShe is still obviously completely wrong though!\n\n100% NTA but a wonderful father!!!", "MIL might need a time-out of several months or years, too. Call a dad that kind of thing? Not cool.", "Yes would she react the same way if the mom was bathing the son", "NTA. You are not doing anything secretive or inappropriate and not without your daughter's support and agreement. In an ideal world, things would be right on a perfect schedule with no problems or issues to arise. We all know that doesn't happen.", "It is called love.", "I was the caretaker for my father, I helped him with the bathroom, I bathed him, I helped him change clothing... Hell when he got worse I changed adult diapers and even wiped his butt. OP's meddling MIL needs to understand that when shit happens, someone needs to take care of it.

She thinks it's inappropriate because of OP and his daughter's gender and age which implies A LOT.
