She spent a few weeks in the hospital and had multiple surgeries.

We do quick spit baths in the sink most of the time but we take her upstairs for an actual shower twice a week. I know having her dad help her shower is a little uncomfortable for her so I carry her up the stairs and get her into the shower then let my wife (her stepmom) take over, then carry her down to her bed. \n\nMy MIL has been staying with us since my daughter\u2019s accident to help with the other kids and the house. She\u2019s always disapproved of me helping my daughter out with these things and says that we should wait until her caretaker comes (we have a caretaker come for a few hours a couple times a week). \n\nMy wife was working a double and my daughter said she was feeling gross and really wanted to take a shower. I reminded her that my wife wasn\u2019t going to be home until late that night and her caretaker wouldn\u2019t be here until the next day so it would be me or MIL helping her. She thought about it and said she wants me to do it. \n\nWe did her shower and MIL saw me carrying her downstairs after. After I got my daughter situated in her room, she pulled me aside and asked if I was helping my daughter. I said yes and she told me I should\u2019ve waited for my wife or the caretaker or even my oldest daughter (20) to give my daughter her shower. She says it\u2019s highly inappropriate for me to be in the bathroom with her after a certain age. \n\nShe called my wife to complain and my wife doesn\u2019t want to hear the complaining so she\u2019s asking me to either not do my daughters showers or try to do it when her mom is out of the house.

Wait for caregiver or you or MIL. \n\nShe picked you. That's all that matters. You listened to your child. You gave her what she needed / wanted in that moment.", "NTA. She gave you permission to do this.

You\u2019re a father taking care of your badly injured daughter. MIL needs to get over it.", "NTA at all \n\nI want to specify that likely your wife should handle most of the conversation with your MIL, but MIL is way out of line here. That's your daughter who is injured who requested your help. If be very tempted to ask your MIL to spell out exactly what she's accusing you of because implying that you'd take advantage of your daughter in that fashion is disgusting. If it were me she would no longer be welcome in my house and I would be telling other family members exactly why in case she tries to imply to others what she's already implying to you", " NTA I hate this kind of stereotype kids should be able to be helped and loved by both parent without one of the being seen as creep. Your MIL is out of line and if she doesn\u2019t like it tell her she can leave your MIL is the real AH here", "NTA\nOutside of the fact that she is your daughter she is severely injured and unable to do it herself. \nYou had her permission and were  in the position to help her with what she needed. The fact that your MIL expected her to wait till the next day feeling unclean and gross is the A-Hole move. \n\nIf a person needs help and they approve of the situation then they should get the help they need! \n\nAlso beat wishes for a fast and smooth recovery for your daughter.", "NTA, there was no creepiness in this situation. You explained to your daughter the options available and she asked you to help her. \nPersonally I think you get bonus dad points for helping her shower because not many teenage girls would be happy to have their dad help them in this way.", "NTA. You're being a dad. You gave her her options, let her consider them, and helped her when she asked for it. \n\nYour MIL is being an asshole by trying to interfere with your parenting and helping your literally disabled child do things she can't do when she asks you for help. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "NTA.  Ask your wife why your daughter has to be punished for her inability to set boundaries with her own mother.", "NTA. This was your daughter\u2019s decision, so you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

It is not helpful in challenging circumstances to criticize those who step up and do something out of their comfort zone for the right reasons. \n\nAlso, it's your daughter's body. She got to decide what she was comfortable with.  \n\nFinally, there are plenty of circumstances where caretakers have to care for members of the opposite sex.  A lot of OBGYNs are male, a lot of nurses and CNAs bathe/toilet patients of opposite gender.  So what?", "NTA\n\nThis is what family is for: helping when nobody else can nor will.", "The only thing matters here is if your daughter is comfortable with your help and honestly it's kinda fucked that MIL is being so weird about it at all.

They\u2019re sexualizing a situation where a father is helping a daughter in her time of need.", "Nta. There was nothing creepy here. The fact your MIL thought it was creepy is the creepy part. Your daughter gave her permission to you, her father, to help her. There's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it's awesome your daughter knew she could trust you, when she was vulnerable, to help. I think that makes you a good father.", "NTA. If your daughter is comfortable with it then no one else\u2019s opinion even matters. She\u2019s probably at the stage where her body is starting to feel like hers again.

You are her Dad!\n\nEnd of!!!!!!", "NTA. Your MIL is gross for turning hygiene needs into something sexual.", "NTA. It kinda says a lot about your MIL that your daughter would rather have you help her. It also says a lot about you and your relationship with your daughter that she trusts you and is comfortable with you and accepts your help. That's really great and I hope she always feels safe with you. MIL is way out of line here and your wife should deal with her when she can. Don't tell your daughter that she said anything, she's got enough things to worry about without knowing MIL was being pervy. I had a grandmother sexualize me at that age and it did a lot of lasting damage. You're a good dad, protect her from that nonsense. I hope she recovers fast and everything goes smoothly.", "NTA. Your mother in law is super gross. Her weird hang ups are no reason you should not help your injured daughter who specifically asked for your help. Your wife's response was not okay. She needs to either talk to her mother about why she is wrong or tell her that she needs to be quiet if she can't be helpful. MIL is beyond out of line.", "NTA, your MIL is willing to let your daughter feel gross until the caretaker arrives. Your daughter would rather to ask you than your MIL, that tells me the comfort level she has with you both. Your wife needs to worry more about your daughter's comfort than the fact that she can't just tell her mom  to shut up when she whines about you taking care of your daughter.", "Dear God, I hope this isn't a click bait post.", "NTA to care for an injured family member, especially when your daughter requested the help and your wife doesn't sound alarmed about it. However I can certainly see how it could raise red flags for others. Just be cautious.

She chose to have you help. The audacity of the people trying to overstep her own physical autonomy. NTA. \n\nWhy would it be creepy either way? Is MIL sexualizing your daughter and/or your relationship to her? You helped her shower, nothing else. Again, the audacity!", "NTA. It was your daughter's choice and her physical and mental well-being is the most important during recovery. If you weren't suggesting or pressuring your daughter into this, and you offered alternatives then there really isn't a problem. This sounds just like parenting to me and stepping up when needed. \nI hope your daughter recovers and feels better soon.", "NTA  She is your daughter and you are her father!  Between your wife and a caretaker and your oldest daughter, it sounds like everyone is pulling together to help meet your injured child's needs and it can't always be the same person, with varying schedules.\n\nThis is an entirely different circumstance that what your MIL is attempting to make it into.  You are not doing anything secretive or inappropriate and not without your daughter's support and agreement.  In an ideal world, things would be right on a perfect schedule with no problems or issues to arise.  We all know that doesn't happen.\n\nKeep putting your daughter's best interest and her needs at the forefront and work with your wife to set schedule's.  It's none of MIL's business to make wave when you already have enough to deal with.", "NTA. You are being a good parent and taking care of your daughter by helping her AT HER REQUEST with things she is unable to do for herself. \n\nIt sounds to me that MIL has overstayed her welcome at this point.", "NTA. It's your injured child, but more importantly, your daughter gave her consent. That's what matters. I'm concerned that your wife sided more with her mom. Is it your wife's daughter too?", "NTA that's your DAUGHTRR and she is severely injured. You bathed her when she was a baby, this is no different, except she is older.", "NTA. Your MIL needs to stop projecting her ideas about how you sexualize your daughter on you.  Your daughter can't shower without help right now and she shouldn't have to wait days to get one.", "NTA \n\nWhen your child is medically unable to care for themselves then sometimes parents have to do things like assist in bathing.\n\nBeing someone who has had some major surgeries while I was growing up there have been times when my dad has had had to help me do things like shower or dress.

You\u2019re doing what you can to help your daughter and sticking to what makes your daughter comfortable. \n\nYour MIL is TA and your wife kinda is too. \n\nYour MIL is TA because she thinks a father helping his daughter is wrong, even when your daughter specifically requested it and is obviously comfortable with you. Your MIL is a creep for insinuating you\u2019ve done something creepy, simply because it involved nudity. She needs to butt out and stop being sexist. \n\nYour wife is TA for not backing you up and not setting boundaries with her mother.", "NTA - the only one who is a problem here is the MIL for thinking the way she does.     \nAnd probably your wife too for not just telling her to shut up.    \nI\u2019d tell MIL to get out, your daughter is going to start thinking there\u2019s something wrong with her for letting you shower her.", "NTA. Your MIL is sexualising your daughter. I\u2019m going to take a punt on you being North American\u2026since other areas of the world have less problems with this.", "NTA!

I am sick of the double standards. A father is a parent like the mother and not some random guy babysitting ffs.", "NTA. You are doing as any parent would. I would only question MIL's continued presence. She obviously dislikes you and likes to think of herself as being the pillar of morality. Her kind of help you don't really need, do you? \n\nI would tell my MIL that she is not to speak to me again til she apologizes to me and my daughter for sexualizing our relationship in front of my wife. I'd tell my wife that only an immoral person would jump to that kind of conclusion and I don't want that kind of influence around any child.", "Worth an upvote as you have a unique perspective and was in the same situation. \n\nAnd being a parent sometimes isn't pretty,  this is one of those situations where I commend you for stepping up. \n\nNTA OP ( EDIT) TYPO", "Yes!

Make her understand that what's she's thinking is creepy and outdated.", "Thank you", "Well, I\u2019m definitely not her first choice. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m her second choice either.

Is this a typo or you meant it?", "My father was really sick before he died (he had a stroke years ago and couldn't use his legs and one of his arms). He lived in a house where he was given care of, but I helped him at the toilet or cleaning himself. We both felt uncomfortable with it but it was necessary", "That's fair, nobody's perfect I just think she's kinda being a bad wife in this situation.", "So you're enabling your own ability to be walked all over in your own house? Odd choice, but it is your choice.\n\nYour wife should be on your side, not your MILs, regardless of what y'all have going on in your life. If you can't be a united front about helping your daughter what other issues are there?\n\nTell your MIL to stop sexualizing your daughter, and tell your wife to stop supporting through complacency the sexualization of your daughter.", "If you've ever been abused or known a child who has been abused by a parent, it's not a stretch to see red flags here. I wouldn't call them all disgusting."]}
