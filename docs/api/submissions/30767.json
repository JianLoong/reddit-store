I mean, she was clearly in a controlling relationship. Not gonna say she had no part in it, but at the same time, it doesn't seem like she ever wanted to be mean to you or anything. Sounds like she got taken advantage of, and roped into an abusive relationship right out of high school.\n\nNow, just speaking in general, I don't think you are obligated to let anyone stay in your home.

Like the initial controlling saying that she wasn't allowed to contact you.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like you were hurt by Sarah's choice to distance herself due to her partner's discomfort. It's understandable that you would feel that your relationship was affected negatively. However, the situation is complex, and you might be holding onto the pain of the past. Refusing her aid in a time of dire need is quite a strong stance. While you're under no obligation to offer assistance, a compassionate approach could have involved connecting her with relevant resources or support networks. Perhaps consider exploring your feelings regarding the past friendship to see if there's an opportunity for closure or understanding. Ultimately, it's not so much about owing Sarah something but recognizing the human need for help, especially in challenging circumstances. The choice was yours, but the situation offers a chance for reflection.", "Listen to your wife. Then you are always right.", "Sarah has been lucky enough to escape an abusive relationship alive.\n\nYou are blaming her for the actions of her abuser.\n\nI won't say you are the AH, her ex husband is.

Ian was clearly abusive and controlling and it was clearly Ian who FORCED her to cut contact with you, against her will. Don't *punish* her for that, when she was just being his  victim. I bet she *wanted* to contact you for ages. This is your opportunity to reconnect and undo the damage Ian did.\n\nBut NAH I guess.", "ESH.  She was in an abusive relationship and handled it badly.  \n\nIt doesn't mean you owe her anything.  Just recognize she wasn't in a healthy environment and made the wrong choices.  It still damaged your friendship, regardless.", "NTA. Sarah can fuck all the way off to somewhere else.

If so, it would be wise to heed her experience.", "NAH Personally, I wouldn't hold the relationship stuff against her.... do you know their actual dynamic? maybe he was abusive. I mean shit I used to be like that, the jealous type and I look back on it now as abuse, I was trying to control who this other person is speaking to. She just didn't want to have a knockout dragout fight everytime you texted or him looking over her shoulder.

So can we just forget anything happened and let me move in with your family?\u201d It\u2019s as ridiculous as it sounds. NTA.", "You don\u2019t know her back story of why she is actually homeless. She is young enough to have living family- why doesn\u2019t she go there?", "NTA\u2026you really do not know this person nor their situation.  You would be letting a stranger into your home.  There are other options besides you out there.  One would have to wonder why none of those other options are letting her stay with them.", "NTA, but only barely.  You are within reason to not let someone into your house that you haven't seen in years, and don't know anything about anymore, in particular how she became homeless and so out there she is standing on people's doorsteps asking for help.  That is extreme desperation.\n\nOn the other hand - it is extremely obvious that she was in a coercive-control relationship \\*at best\\* and outright abusive at worst, and I find your dismissal of this fact so cold and bizarre it makes me wonder about \\*you\\*.  At a minimum I would get in touch with her family or other people who were in her friend circle to see what's going on and if she is being helped.", "NTA - I would just try to hear what your wife has to say, as she doesn't agree with your point of view. Remember that you both were 18 or so at the time, and holding onto a grudge or a decision at 18 is strange. It's possible she was in an abusive relationship, as many pointed out - in addition to going into a high stress environment like the military. Her boyfriend pressuring her to cut off a friendship of four years a strong red flag. But as someone of a similar age as you, I remember not having the same lessons kids of today have. You have every right to enforce your boundary, and she definitely crossed yours. I'd encourage you to find a way to release the grudge you're holding is all.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed your feelings and they are valid. It is OK to feel hurt she dropped your friendship. It\u2019s NOT your responsibility to care for someone, regardless if they are/were a friend. Yes, it is terrible that Sarah is in a tough situation and its great she is getting away from her abuser. But no, being a victim doesn\u2019t make it OK to pressure you into a relationship. \n\nYour feelings matter and you can\u2019t just turn them off. That doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. And, if you have resentment for how you were dropped, she should absolutely not be staying with you, anyway. It would not be healthy for either of you. Even if you were to give her physical shelter, I don\u2019t see how the emotional climate wouldn\u2019t negatively impact you, your wife, and Sarah.", "Info did Ian make her cut off everyone in her life? I only asked this because it sounds like he was abusive and controlling. She probably doesn't have anyone to turn to if he did it with everyone else. It's quite common for abusive relationships in which the partner makes them completely cut off all relationships in order to have better control of their partner / victim", "Yeah, if true, I also think this is very strange. My complete guess is that either she had burned a lot of bridges in her life, or her ex husband isolated her from everyone, or a combination of both, so she has nobody to turn to right now. She probably thought about where things could have been different in life, and she thought about that nice boy in high school she cruelly cut off, and reached out to him in desperation.\n\nEither way, this woman is a complete stranger to OP at this point. He doesn't know what kind of baggage she is dealing with, and it would not be wise for his sake or his wife's sake to take her in.", "Abusive people often isolate their partners from their entire social networks, so my guess is the rest of her friends and family probably went the same way as OP. It\u2019s also possible OP wasn\u2019t her first call, maybe a bunch of other people also told her no for similar reasons.\n\nOP is still NTA, but imo the friend is more likely an escaped abuse survivor than an old acquaintance up to something shady.", "Or missing from the OPs story.   But yeah on what's presented, NTA", "I was curious about that too. Although addresses are easy to find online.", "She didn't establish boundaries. She was an abuse victim.\n\nI don't think OP is the AH for not letting her stay. That is a lot to take on and not necessarily something to jump into, especially with someone you haven't talked to in 4 years. But with the new information he has, it changes the context of what happened.", "Pretty ballsy of Sarah to be in an abusive relationship, amirite?", "I would have certainly helped her if she hadn't done that, but as she cut off all ties with me I didn't want to. And I know it's abusive, but she sounded glad about remaining with Ian and was very rude to me? It's not like she was sorry about it, she was happy to agree with him and cut me off immediately without any qualms.", "You think bringing a woman from his past into his home indefinitely while he has a wife is a good idea????", "I don't know whether he was abusive or jealous. Not sure whether he wanted to isolate her from just me or everyone else, but she did not mind talking to me until he asked her not to which makes me think that it was his jealousy?", "Yes, I get the whole burned bridges / isolated vibe here too. She probably looked for the least burned bridge and tried. Likely tried multiple people. \n\nNTA though, you don\u2019t want or need that baggage in your life.", "Agreed. Assuming OP is in the US and that his friend joined the US Army they have a host of veterans services including a homelessness prevention program. \n\nI come from a military family and every local VA Office has a host of services to assist. \u2611\ufe0f\u2611\ufe0f", "I think OP is down playing their friendship or he was trying to date her. Maybe I'm an oddball but I don't message people I'm just friendly with that often and if they told me their GF wasn't comfortable with it my reaction wouldn't be to get that upset unless we were closer than a friendly acquaintance. \n\n\nNTA because you aren't obligated to take her in but I think OP isn't being all that forthcoming about their relationship.", "Ballsy abused folk and the audacity!!!", "clearly she was keeping him as a backup and ian sensed that", "Would you act sorry when your abuser will punish you for it and you know they\u2019re reading the messages/listening to the call? Of course not. You\u2019d put on the act to protect yourself. And if you say otherwise.. you are blessed to have not have that fear or not experienced it. Seriously, how else was she gonna act around an abusive person? Sound not glad and get beat? Seriously??\n\nI\u2019m not saying you need to help her now. It\u2019s been what, well over a decade? You have no need tk open your home to what is now a stranger. But you sound like you think it\u2019s her fault she was abused, and that is\u2026 frankly way more disgusting. Especially since she clearly considered you a safe person and you\u2019re\u2026 not.", "> she cut off all ties\n\nI bet my head it was Ian who made her do that\n\n>she sounded glad about remaining with Ian and was very rude to me\n\nI bet my head it was Ian who made her behave like that\n\n>she was happy to agree with him and cut me off immediately without any qualms\n\nI bet my head it was Ian who made her behave like that\n\nThis is what abuse victims DO. This is textbook stuff.", "Men and women can be friends you know. That\u2019s got nothing to do with it.  It wanting to invite drama into your house with someone who\u2019s pretty much a stranger\u2026 different story.", "He never said there was drama. Why are you on attack mode? What happened to kindness?", "His wife seems to think so", "if he wanted and forced her to isolate herself then that IS abusive.", "That's exactly what OP's trying to tell her, but she's determined she can change him! \ud83d\ude09 Sorry for the dark humour,  but let's not misdirect anger and venom intended for Ian on OP.", "NTA for not letting her stay with you; it's your house.\n\nBUT it's a little messed up that you are reacting with these comments.  Abusers are very good at what they do or else no one would stay with them; your friend didn't know it was happening until it was too late.  Your wife has a point about showing her a little grace about that.  You don't have to let her stay with you but you could give her a list of local shelters for victims.  It would take literally just a few minutes of googling.", "Likely, but that doesn't explain why OP should open his home to her now. Or why that would even be wise? If she doesn't sort her shit out, she'll find another 'Ian' quick. She just needs to keep showing up on random high school acquaintances' doorsteps - and he'll find her.  The only thing OP owes her is a drive to a shelter - and that's just humanitarian obligation. I have a lot of empathy for this woman, but not for her continued bad decision-making. A person would have to have their own codependency issues to involve themselves in this, IMO. Good for OP for healthy boundaries.", "Men and women can definitely be friends. But letting a woman with no relation to you that you haven't seen in multiple years stay in your house when you have a wife is absolutely insane", "I know he didn't. I am saying there will be drama if he let her stay at his house for an undetermined amount of time.... Seriously, how do you not understand that???", "His wife does and he doesn't. Marriages take two to make big decisions", "This this this", "Oh god yes, absolutely all this, that's all really good points you make there.   I'd not let her stay either. But I'd re-open communication. That's plenty for now and could in itself make a big difference.", "I get what you are saying. But he hasn\u2019t indicated she has any substance issues. And his wife doesn\u2019t seem bothered. He could let her stay and help her find a place. Many people these days are helping family and friends with space to live. The housing crisis is real. Place some ground rules and go from there."]}
