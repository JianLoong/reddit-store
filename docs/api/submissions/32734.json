She has never mer Rosie yet she uses her picture to build a profile online as the good stepmother. It would have been equally bad even if she had met Rosie, but the disinterest in the baby, contrasted by the zealous posting of her picture, shows the woman can go to great length to use everything and everybody for online scores. This is pure manipulation.\n\nStick to your guns. Maybe reconsider restricting Rebecca\u2019s access to Rosie but keep your no-picture rule enforced tightly.", "NTA. \n\nIan didn't step up.

'because she felt that he deserved some sort of access to his child', that was not her place to decide for your child.  While it is good to have as many family as possible involved in your child's life, not these family.  They have proven themselves to be selfish unto themselves only and betrayed you.  For that, your child doesn't need these people in her life, ever.  You didn't overreact, you did what you needed to do and that is to protect your child.  You should seek a family attorney and get full custody if you don't already have it and to bar your ex-BF and his family  from ever seeing your daughter.", "NTA\n\nDad is an idiot.

Did Rebecca lead you to believe she has no contact with her son?", "I get why you are angry, but I think jumping so quickly to denying grandma access is not doing your daughter any good.

Both parents of a child are free to make decisions regarding their child whether you've become accustomed to full authority over the child or not.

No access unless Court Ordered, which would include him paying Child Support?  You are NTA.", "I didn't explicitly say \"don't share these\" but when I gave them to her I did mention how I felt a lot better giving people physical copies because then I would know who had that sort of access to my daughter, you know? Like if it was online then there's no way to know how many people have seen it, or if it's been posted elsewhere, so it gave me peace of mind as I'm a pretty private person. So Rebecca was aware of my feelings on people I didn't know having pictures of my daughter.\n\nAs for the NC with Ian thing, Rebecca informed me that they rarely spoke, especially since he was upset with her for being even mildly involved when I was pregnant.", "She shouldn't have to specify that photos shouldn't be shared.

The OP didn't ask if he was the father of her child. She asked if keeping the child away from the child's grandmother was an A move. It is.", "She was upset with him for a while due to how he treated me, amongst other things lol, but I don't know that it ever came to the point where she was no longer interested in some form of relationship with him. So it was never really a falling out per say, just a dwindling of the relationship. Really any lack of contact or amount of tension was just a decision Ian made on his own."]}
