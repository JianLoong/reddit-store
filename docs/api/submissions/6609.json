We gave them a room, drove them to several sketchy places and work on a daily basis.\nAfter the first screaming match between L and M in my house I told L that we wanted to help them but that they couldn't stay with us anymore, so she moved back in with her drug dealing parents. Soon after, M moved out but would visit frequently to complain and ask for money and advice. \nThe next summer while the kids and I were on vacation with my family (my husband was to join us on the weekend) my husband invited M to stay with us again. What followed was almost a year of back and forth between a new girl D and us and the old girl L. I was very uncomfortable with it because I knew M was selling drugs although everyone said that he wasn't bringing it to our house(come to find out later that that wasn't true). I finally told my husband and M that he couldn't stay past a certain date. I was 3 months pregnant at this point and not willing to entertain any more. He left, but was back three months later. He stayed in a tent in our backyard, but came inside to use the bathroom and kitchen and watch TV.\nWhen L got out of rehab for the tenth time she asked if she could stay with us. I was uncomfortable with us and when she came to visit and didn't leave even I asked if she had somewhere to go and she said yes. She never left. At that point i had had enough. I had had my baby and hated staying where we were for a multitude of reasons. M and L brought risk to my house and I had expressed that concern multiple times to multiple parties and nothing was being done. I didn't want to call the police because my husband was \"friends\" with these people and he knew that they wouldn't hurt us so there was no reason to make them leave. \nI packed our stuff and told my husband that we would be back after they left.

The friend will probably have a key and be driving your husband's car before youve been gone a week.  If you remain gone for a few weeks dont be surprised if he has allowed other deadbeat friends to move into the child's nursery.\n\nThe best thing you can do dor yourself and your child is to contact a lawyer, have the attorney create an official separate agreement where you have 100% custody &he can only jave supervised visits because he has proven he doesnt have your child's best interest at heart, evidenced by his propensity to allow drug addicts open access to the home you preciously shared.

I have been cut out of my family completely because I value my daughters life and well being over that of a bunch of addicts.

This is not the time to be passive.  First, talk to your parents about how long you can stay and what they expect while you're there. You're already fighting on one front and you dont need to open a second front with your folks over mismatched expectations. Next, talk to a lawyer about the best and worst case scenarios if you divorce. Be brutally honest about whats been happening over the past two years. Also ask if you need to file for separation and what that entails. Lastly, arrange for a meeting with your ex on neutral ground like a starbucks between your locations. Give him your terms for coming back. I think they should include: relocation because the house is now a \"drug house\" (its on the radar of other addicts and dealers), cutting contact with m/l/d permanently, and no more inviting people to live with you.
