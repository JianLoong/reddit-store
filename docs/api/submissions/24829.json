That may take some time, because clearly they were secretly hoping for grandchildren, and they are going to grieve for awhile.\n\nI'm not saying they're justified in their anger -- they're not -- but clearly they were saying one thing while hoping another, and they will need time to learn to accept it.", "Your aunt is T A for pushing and pushing and pushing in the family chat so you basically felt the need to disclose this VERY PRIVATE information with her, in a private message.\n\n(And then she spread it like wildfire.)\n\nYou always honestly TOLD them you weren't going to have any kids.\n\nThey are upset because they never BELIEVED you.\n\nThat's on them, not on you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, and I'm confused as to how they think they've been lied to. You have been nothing but up-front with your partner and his family that you weren't interested in having children.

Instead, she used your explanation to attack you. You tried JADE (justify, explain, defend, explain) believing if she understood, she'd stop pushing that boundary. Sadly, she DOES understand, she DOESN'T agee. \n\nYour boundaries do not require anyone else's approval or \"understanding\" to be valid. This is a lesson for you to respond to boundary pushing with LESS, not more, effort and explanation. The motives of those disrespecting your boundaries don't really matter. Whether you fully understand their motives doesn't matter. You've clearly stated your boundary and they are pushing against it. THAT matters.

Thanks for continuing to bring it up.\" Never another crack about it again.", "NTA, and now you know not to trust random nosy family members with information.

You aren't obligated to disclose your private medical history with anybody.  Having said that, you probably shouldn't have told the nosey Aunt either.  None of this is anybody's business but you and your husband.

Again, none of their business!", "They definitely were hinging their hopes on an accidental pregnancy or that OP might change her mind. \n\nA tubal ligation pretty much shuts the door on that so that\u2019s why they\u2019re pissed.
