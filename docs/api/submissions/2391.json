Sending warm thoughts to you getting yourself and your cat out of there quickly.", "I was trying how to nicely word the cats are great for telling you the character of the person and then got to \"he calls me fucking stupid\" and it was a record scratch in my brain.  There is no situation where this is okay.    Well, maybe if you were in extreme danger and needed to signal someone was holding you hostage? But an extreme situation for sure", "Good. \n\nWhere I live, him shooting you with a salt gun is considered bad enough to give you a justified defense.", "That is bulling abusive behaviour.\n\nHe verbally abused you, waking you by screaming at you at 3am. because his drunk ass couldn't find the vodka.\n\nHe then decided to be physically abusive, shooting you with the salt gun, and then crying abuse when you pushed him away, threatening that you would lose your cat and job just because you tried to stop him.\n\nWhen he is drunk and \"playfully hitting you,\" and he doesn't stop when you ask him not to hurt you. \nIt isn't playful it is deliberate. He is pushing boundaries and getting you used to the excuses he will continue to use when he really does hurt you.\n\nDitch this guy. \n\nYou deserve to be treated better than this. Get yourself safe and definitely keep the cat", "no offense but i call bullshit on that. i am in my 30s, i have grown up with cats and always owned cats. almost all my friends had cats, dogs or any other animals. its literally normal cat behavior what you described.\n\ni ll be honest, this has always been a deal breaker for me. i always put my cats first. if my partner to be doesnt get along with cats or doesnt like them, let alone disrespect them, then we do not work out. cats are extremely important to me so i want my partner to have the same values as i do. if they dont, they are not boyfriend material for me. does this make them bad people? no, not at all - each to their own but they 100% arent the right fit for me.\n\ncats are on average a 10-12 year commitment. if my partner doesnt get along or disrespects them, they can pack their bags. period. literally not wasting a second thought on it.", "If you can't leave the guy, try placing the cat on the Home to Home website, try to find a new home. It deserves better treatment. I would not want to be with a human that was that indifferent to animals. Do you envision your life child and pet-free, because if he is this horrible to a cat, imagine a puppy or child. they typically don't land well when thrown off beds. Did he agree to this cat?", "yeah, NTA.\n\nmy mom married a man who didn\u2019t like cats and it turned out he was:\nA - cheating on her\nB - hiding 2 past marriages with like 5 kids\nC - was hiding a past sex offender charge.

People have come in and been bothered by sharing the couch with my babies and I'm just like \"listen, they live here, you do not. Don't like it? Go away\" I'll get them if they are being pushy for attention and I can tell the person it's digging it but other than that, do not treat my kids poorly. I'd never be with a man that didn't love them as much as I do. I do however call them many names, alot of them aren't very nice. Lol.

You don't deserve to be called names, especially when all you're trying to do is defend your animal. There are force-free ways of training a cat, and water bottle and tossing the cat are not it.\n\nPlease OP stay safe as you're trying to leave. This is the scariest time when you're in an abusive relationship, they will generally escalate things when they can tell you're about to escape their grip. When it's time to go, have friends or family with you move the things, and get kitty out first thing. If at all possible I would board the cat with a friend while you figure this out. Your boyfriend is not to be trusted.", "Thank you I do too! I found somewhere that\u2019s close to my job so I\u2019m hoping it works out!", "Good luck to you! You should never be with someone who calls you names.  Not acceptable.  \nYou and your cat deserve better! \n\nNTA but the boyfriend is", "Don't slow down.", "Good luck!  NTA"]}
