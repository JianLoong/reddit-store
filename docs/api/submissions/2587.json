He did nothing wrong. He shouldn\u2019t have to inform you every time he goes to pick him up because of a \u201csometimes.\u201d", "Oh yeah, sorry I'm new here. \n\nThanks though, and a good point. I didn't realize it was that he only *sometimes* goes. \n\nIn that case then yeah I mean honestly how was Ted supposed to even know that Dad would be there and ugh yeah, honestly maybe dad is kindof an asshole here. I just wanted to try to give him the benefit of the doubt.", "And the ex wife frequently turns up too? If you\u2019re used to seeing your kid after school together with someone, and you always get there first, and then you discover they aren\u2019t there and you can\u2019t get a hold of the second person and you know the signature on the sign out book also isn\u2019t theirs.. you wouldn\u2019t freak out a little? You wouldn\u2019t be worried or use the wrong words? \n\nOP didn\u2019t \u201cfreak out\u201d, he called Ted and tried to explain why he was unhappy. He\u2019s now here asking opinions to try to get a hold of the situation. \n\nI\u2019m not saying Ted should have called, I\u2019m saying that given the very clearly outlined routine that everyone has going, Ted could have sent a text.", "I want to know where my kid is?", "If my ex went to my son's school to see him as is the routine and our son was picked up by my wife, then yes, my ex would be pissed off.", "If she didn't tell me and I drove all the way done there then I'd be pissed. That's fucking rude.", "So? He should had asked.", "It was not planned ahead for OP to go to the school. He just sometimes shows up. This day, when he showed up and the kid had already been collected. So? It was his wife's custody time and he did not let anyone know that he was coming. She had arranged for one of the people on the list of approved people (Tate's stepfather) to pick him up that day.\n\nWhy would anyone even think they needed to call the noncustodial parent to let them know that the custodial parent was having her husband pick up the boy, much less to *ask his permission*?\n\nWhen it is his parenting time, does he keep his ex up to date on the exact whereabouts of the child at all times? Is he calling to tell her if his wife decides to take Tate for ice cream while he cuts the grass?\n\n> I sometimes will go see Tate before or after school regardless of who is picking him up or dropping him off. \n\nThis sounds a little odd to begin with... Way to invade the other parent's custodial time.\n\n> He likes seeing both of us together.\n\nThe kid likes seeing his parents both of whom have remarried, together. This seems confusing, and I wonder if OP is projecting a little.\n\n> I went to see Tate before his mom picked him up (she has him this week)\n\nOP is the one who should be \"asking permission\"... before butting in on his ex's parenting time. He should not be showing up unexpectedly.", "He's with his stepdad.", "OK, and you found out, it's not like your son suddenly disappeared, he left school with a trusted adult. Your ex's husband is allowed to pick up the kid, he's on the list. If it's not your custody week, he isn't your responsibility.  Your ex doesn't need to run little things like this by you. You don't have a say over what she does, and she isn't answerable to you unless her actions are detrimental to your son.\n\nSo back off and be grateful that your son has two caring father figures.", "YTA  and you honestly sounds exhausting. They don't need to inform you of all their activities ahead of time as long as the kids are safe and your official time with them is not compromised.", "Should she text you 50 times a day \u201ctaking him shopping\u201d \u201ctaking him to the toilet\u201d \u201che\u2019s in the bath\u201d \u201ctaking him to the park\u201d ? It\u2019s literally none of your business.\n\nDo you text her every time you pick the kids up when it\u2019s your turn to have the kids ?", "But it's not your custody time.  The fact that you and your ex sometimes go to the school to see him during the other's time doesn't matter.  Not your custody time, it's not your call.  If Ted is on the list, he can pick the kids up, and he doesn't need to tell you anything about it.", "And the stepfather told you that he\u2019s with him.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem?", "That\u2019s understandable, but your ex doesn\u2019t need to check in with you when it\u2019s her week.  If she makes arrangements for Ted to pick up the boys, that\u2019s there\u2019s deal.    \nTed did not need to agree to let you know when he gets the boys, you are insanely lucky he agreed.  I hope you appreciate that.", "He\u2019s with a trusted family member on your ex\u2019s time. You don\u2019t have to know where he is. He\u2019s with his step father.", "So are you mad about the fact the stepdad picked him up at all? Or are you mad about the lack of communication since you were planning to be there too? Personally, I\u2019d be upset that i wasn\u2019t told because it changed my plans and was a waste for me to show up if my kid was already gone from school. So if that\u2019s the case then you can request that it be communicated prior on the days you\u2019re planning on doing a joint pickup. But it seems unreasonable to demand the stepdad tell you EVERY time he does a school pickup.", "It\u2019s not your custody time.", "Oh yes they do", "I don't care what my ex does with my son. \n\nI care who he is with.", "Um he didn't ask me?", "Do you have a court order that says that?", "You came for judgement, and so far it's pretty overwhelming.  Sorry it's not going the way you expected, but aside from your pride getting hurt a bit,  you haven't given any reason as to why they would need to inform you of changes to plans that really don't affect you.   So far you only seem insecure and controlling.", "That's nice. Do you have any sort of court order that says your ex needs your permission to have someone else pick the kid up during her custodial time?", "But he had your ex's permission and she is currently the custodial parent. Unless you have a court order saying otherwise, you have no say in this situation.", "Do you have a court order in place saying the step parent has to let both parents know/permission?"]}
