So this rule makes your guest list 1 Person shorter? This rule doesn't do anything else than excluding the boyfriend of Anna?", "NTA. Your wedding, your guest list. As long as you are applying the rule equally there\u2019s nothing wrong with limiting the guest list.", "Soft YTA. Will the wedding be held where you live or closer to where she is? If it were the latter, I could understand and support your decision to not invite her partner, but if she has to travel far then it's pretty shitty of you to look the other way and deny an invite. It's no fun traveling for a wedding by yourself because even though the friend group will be there it isn't the same. To be honest if I had a partner that was excluded from a friend's wedding I wouldn't necessarily end my friendship with them, but it would definitely dampen it.", "NTA  for not inviting the bf.\n\nYou are between a rock and a hard place.  Your venue has a headcount limit, and you have limited funds.  You  came up with a rule to satisfy both issues.  However,  you should have reached out to guests with+1s who didn't make the cut and explain the issue and that you were sorry you couldn't invite their date.", "INFO: has anyone other than anna had their partner left out??", "NTA, but NTA to your friend if they skip your wedding.  I would skip it", "YTA:  According to your post all your other friends are either married or have been dating for over a year. So basically it sounds like out of all your friends only Anna's partner wasn't invited.  That doesn't sound like a rule for everyone but a rule made specifically to avoid inviting her partner", "It's weird to assume your unmarried guests would want to come solo. Most people want to bring a date.\n\nAnna + 1 should be the default setting. \n\nYTA.", "I mean, you can invite who you have but saying 12 months is serious and 10 months isn't seems arbitrary. \n\n>all our other friends will be bringing their significant others\n\n>it wouldn't be fair to make an exception for her but not invite anyone else's newer partners.\n\nSo which is it? Everyone's partners are included or a lot aren't? If it's the same friend group, then YTA for excluding one partner from a friend group. If it's Anna and one random cousin who don't get +1, if you invite Anna's BF it's not like a guest she doesn't know will ask how long they've been dating. It's hard to be the fifth wheel in a friend group though", "YTA for not explaining it to her beforehand and she is rightfully hurt, the only perspective she had was from other people previously and she probably couldn\u2019t connect the dots there without knowing about your 1 year rule", "She doesn\u2019t have company for your wedding. Maybe it\u2019s also about this. YTA", "YTA. They are a couple, and offering a plus 1 is standard with most weddings.", "NTA. Venue and budget restrictions often result in having to create \u201crules\u201d for how you are going to cut down the guest list. And usually the rule annoys someone, but expecting a bf of 10 months, that the bride/groom have never met, to be invite is not reasonable.", "YTA. 10 months is a long time.", "INFO: did the people in longer relationships get a +1 or were the partners invited specifically and by name? \n\nIf they were invited with names and either you or your partner met all of them then I suggest to tell her that (if true). You invited them because they are a part of your social circle, not purely budget.", "Nta. And reaching out about being hurt feels really entitled", "YTA - you're gonna lose a friend over this.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nI'm old-school on this, but I think it's bad manners to not allow every wedding guest a plus-1 on the invitation. You want someone to come celebrate you, they should be able to bring a date or a friend.  The idea of \"the bride and groom need to intimately know and love every single person at their wedding\" is a new thing. \n\nI understand you feel differently about this, but don't blame the venue. There are other ways to prune the guest list, and when the RSVPs roll in and there are some confirmed as singles then the 'backup' list can be brought up. Your choice is just your choice.\n\nThat being said, Anna should have just checked the \"No\" and sent her regrets. You and your groom made your decision and she shouldn't be pressing or nagging about it.", "YTA - It so bizarre that people think it's ok to invite adults to weddings without including their partners. it's literally a celebration of partnership and often takes up most of the day.  To single out a small group of your friends and tell them their relationships haven't met your guidelines and they need to leave their partners at home is incredibly tacky.  You can't afford a wedding of this size if you can't properly accommodate your guests.", "NTA. Firstly Congratulations. This is YOUR day  so you do what makes you happy! You don't need to justify yourself for your wedding day", "Definitely NTA- you get to decide the guest list at your own wedding, bottom line.\n\nThe wedding is for you, it's not about them. It is not their event to plan or pay for, so they've gotta respect your boundaries. Especially if you have a max venue capacity haven't even met her boyfriend before.", "NTa you have to make cuts somewhere. Stick to your rules otherwise you will have others asking for exceptions and more hurt feelings. It\u2019s sad she is making you feel this way.  Weddings can be expensive and lines have to be drawn. While it may seem like an arbitrary line to some, what other choices do you have?  This kind of stuff is why I eloped. You just can\u2019t make everyone happy so I did what made us happiest.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The comment I replied to you said it's \"all\" your friends.\n\nIt's your wedding and weddings are expensive so you've got to make cuts somewhere. But you're not even being clear in this post. \n10 months is not much different than 12 months I could see how your friends might think that's a weak excuse especially if everyone else got a plus one. However only you can your partner can dictate who is invited.", "You can say that there's little difference between 10 and 12 months, sure, but as soon as someone who wants their +1 partner of 8 months to be invited with the argument \"It's not so different from 10 months\" comes along, OP would feel obligated to make yet another exception. \n\nIt's called drawing boundaries. People can respect them or simply not attend if having a +1 is really more important than being there at all.", "Sorry, I think you misunderstood what I meant. \u201cAll our friends\u201d referred to Anna and I\u2019s friends from college, which is just 6 people.
