He's not a good guy", "This is exactly the mindset abusive people seek out or create in people. Abusers go after people with lower self-esteem esteem, often people who has previously been through abuse and/or are mentally ill or disabled, because you're more likely to accept blame than isn't yours. You don't feel you truly deserve love and equal treatment, and these people exploit the hell out of this. You end up thinking this is the best you'll ever be treated and will be alone forever or treated worse if you leave. You are worthy kf love and mutual respect. Focusing on just the good moments while someone wrecks havoc on your mental health all the other times is just going to end in more pain. \n\nYou deserve better than this.

When someone starts blaming themselves for all the problems in the relationship where before they'd never felt that way, ESPECIALLY if those feelings lead them to accepting a partner's control over things - like how you answer the phone, when you get to talk to him - it's because they've essentially been trained to see themselves that way. Because their partner has chipped away at their self-esteem and manipulated them into accepting that everything that goes wrong is their own fault.\n\nAnother question for you: does he ever accept any responsibility at all for arguments between you two?\n\nBecause while there are arguments in relationships that are caused wholly by one person's actions, more often it's a combination of behaviors from both people that causes friction and eventually turns into an argument. In a healthy relationship, both people accept responsibility for their own behavior. One person might apologize for doing something that hurt the other, and the other might apologize in turn for yelling, lashing out in response or resorting to the silent treatment, because none of those are healthy ways to handle being upset with a partner. The key is that both people recognize the role they played in the conflict. If it's always only you accepting responsibility for doing things, and never him...he'll want you to believe that it's just because you're uptight/too much/etc., but in a healthy relationship if one person is always upsetting the other, that other person *walks tf away*. Staying with someone who upsets you all the time is unhealthy at best (and frequently a sign of being abused) or evidence that it's a manipulation and they're choosing to stay and use your purported mistakes against you instead of walking away for their own sanity.\n\nYour relationship sounds unhealthy and toxic at best, emotionally abusive at worst.
