He's not a good guy", "This is exactly the mindset abusive people seek out or create in people. Abusers go after people with lower self-esteem esteem, often people who has previously been through abuse and/or are mentally ill or disabled, because you're more likely to accept blame than isn't yours. You don't feel you truly deserve love and equal treatment, and these people exploit the hell out of this. You end up thinking this is the best you'll ever be treated and will be alone forever or treated worse if you leave. You are worthy kf love and mutual respect. Focusing on just the good moments while someone wrecks havoc on your mental health all the other times is just going to end in more pain. \n\nYou deserve better than this.

When someone starts blaming themselves for all the problems in the relationship where before they'd never felt that way, ESPECIALLY if those feelings lead them to accepting a partner's control over things - like how you answer the phone, when you get to talk to him - it's because they've essentially been trained to see themselves that way. Because their partner has chipped away at their self-esteem and manipulated them into accepting that everything that goes wrong is their own fault.\n\nAnother question for you: does he ever accept any responsibility at all for arguments between you two?\n\nBecause while there are arguments in relationships that are caused wholly by one person's actions, more often it's a combination of behaviors from both people that causes friction and eventually turns into an argument. In a healthy relationship, both people accept responsibility for their own behavior. One person might apologize for doing something that hurt the other, and the other might apologize in turn for yelling, lashing out in response or resorting to the silent treatment, because none of those are healthy ways to handle being upset with a partner. The key is that both people recognize the role they played in the conflict. If it's always only you accepting responsibility for doing things, and never him...he'll want you to believe that it's just because you're uptight/too much/etc., but in a healthy relationship if one person is always upsetting the other, that other person *walks tf away*. Staying with someone who upsets you all the time is unhealthy at best (and frequently a sign of being abused) or evidence that it's a manipulation and they're choosing to stay and use your purported mistakes against you instead of walking away for their own sanity.\n\nYour relationship sounds unhealthy and toxic at best, emotionally abusive at worst.

Honey your \u201cboyfriend\u201d is somebody else\u2019s boyfriend/husband. \n\nYou only see him 4 times a month (when he can get away) probably uses the excuse he\u2019s working, taking care of someone. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t answer your call ( because he\u2019s with her and has to try and get away)\n\nWhen he calls you have to answer our call back right away ( because his time is limited he\u2019s sneaking away to talk to you!!!!!!!)\n\n\nGirl\u2026\u2026\u2026 RUNNNNNNNNNNN", "Decide he will not get from you what he will not give you and then let him know that and stick to it.  Just don\u2019t explain why.  That\u2019s where he will always have a reason why you should do what your told but why he will do whatever he wants and not answer to you.  \n\nYou have to decide this. It isn\u2019t up to him. It is ip to you.", "\"He doesn\u2019t answer my calls, I\u2019m expected to answer his or call back immediately.\"\n\nfuck this.  nta.  he is.", "  \nYou have described your boyfriend as having double standards, mocking you, ignoring reasonable requests, calling you an AH when you express your feelings about his bad behavior (gaslighting), ignoring basic requests for respectful behavior, and accusing you of playing the victim (projection?).\n\nWhy are you with this guy?  Don\u2019t you think you deserve someone who respects you?  He has a lot of narcissistic traits.  Relationships should make you feel good, not aggravated.    \n\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA. Also you two do not belong together.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re his girlfriend, you sound like his random offhand pastime.. NTA", "NTA. Looks like classic abuse and then gaslighting.", "You are his mistress, you only meet up 4 times and he cannot be called?", "K. Red flag 1: He doesn't answer your calls, but you have to answer his immediately. Red flag for abuse. This is not normal behavior in a relationship. Do you want to be in a relationship with a man who won't answer your calls and won't answer if you need help? \n\nSide note: is seeing him 4 days a month worth this emotional abuse? \n\nRed flag 2: he insists on calling you at work without warning. Clear, unnecessary, inexcusable violation of reasonable boundaries. There is no good reason for this behavior. No excuse for this will hold any water. \n\nRed flag 3: Calling you to mock/ make fun of you. Clear abuse. \n\nNTA. Get out. I was once in a similar relationship.", "This crusty old man is not treating you with basic curiosity. Why stay with a man who berates you, ignore your boundaries, and openly mocks you?", "You see him 4 days a month and he spends the rest of the time yelling at you, mocking you, interrupting you at work and not returning your calls?\n\nHoney. No. No, baby girl. This is not the way. NTA, except to yourself.", "Dump his horrible ass. Why would you put up with this sh\\*\\*?", "Nta. Dump him.", "NTA. But you will be if you stay with him. He\u2019s 45 and you\u2019re 29\u2026you only see him 4 days a month\u2026on top of the extremely controlling behavior\u2026 girl RUN!", "NTA at all. I have been reading through your responses here... and I am very concerned about your physical, emotional and mental well being. You seem to be defending him in so many ways. You also are blaming yourself. You have been married before... and you stated yourself that you were \"fresh out of a divorce\" when you met this guy. You had NO time to heal, recover, contemplate, or even get to know yourself and your needs, wants and deal breakers before getting together with the dude. Chances are, he knew what he was doing. You were at your most vulnerable when you first met him. There is a LARGE age gap also. That in itself is a red flag. This man is clearly abusive and manipulative. He gaslights you on top of that. You question your sanity, and whether you may be \"the crazy one.\" You are NOT. Being in this relationship is making you feel crazy... because he is warping your reality through his gaslighting. I have a lot of compassion for you. When a person is gaslighted regularly or often enough, one tends to question their reality and sanity. I too am neurodivergent, and I was in an abusive relationship with a cruel man who gaslit me regularly. I blamed myself for being \"different\" and thought that if I \"behaved\" the way he wanted, then he would become calmer, happier and not angry. I was WRONG. I too had that \"sunk cost phallacy\" belief... and towards the end, I really believed that I did not deserve any better than him. He tried to break me down... and he nearly succeeded. NEARLY. I finally left him after one final terrifying night with him. I was done. I soon learned that I deserved so much better, which I now have. \nPLEASE GET OUT. Please seek a trauma therapist to talk to immediately.  I would highly suggest you call a womans organization that helps abused women. You ARE being abused. You are also a mother to three children. Please remember that *everything* that affects you, also affects them.\nAnother thing: you won't be able to \"win\" with this guy. You will never beat him at his own game, or level the playing field,  so please don't even try.  \nTake care of yourself.", "You deserve respect, period.  \n\nYou certainly don\u2019t deserve a partner who feels that it\u2019s appropriate to punish you with disrespect because you aren\u2019t doing exactly what he wants. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the reason he\u2019s an asshole to you. A loving partner is the opposite of an asshole.", "No you don't. he does don't listen to him when he says it's you because that's him causing more problems. I feel sad for you that he's manipulated you enough to think that you were in the wrong when you are absolutely not please get help and leave that guy it'll only get worse from here. Again you're not the cause of the problems. He's manufacturing situations to make you feel bad like you did something wrong it's called manipulation and it sounds like he's pretty good at it. Please run away as fast as you can to stop answering those phone calls.", "Girl, he is gaslighting you SO HARD. Get the eff out!!", "You should go to therapy and stay single until you feel better about yourself.", "Of course he met you at a hotel he was staying at. That\u2019s where he meets all the others, too. At different travel locations. \n\nHoney, you\u2019re getting played.", "Well said, I hope she sees this"]}
