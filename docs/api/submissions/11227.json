I figured out a way to eat a bagel in the morning by just breaking it into pieces and dipping/scooping it into the individual cream cheese containers, and that is how I\u2019ve always ate bagels going forward because it\u2019s just more convenient and less messy. \n\nAnyways, I just moved into an apartment with my boyfriend (21M) 2 months ago (for context, we\u2019ve been together for a total of 6 months) and when he saw me eat a bagel at home for the first time, he hinted at how weird and kinda gross it is that I \u201cdouble dip\u201d into the cream cheese container. But I rebutted that it was only us two living in the apartment, and certainly the only two using the cream cheese. But the longer I continued to do it, the more mad he got with me, saying how \u201che doesn\u2019t want my germs in his cream cheese\u201d or it\u2019s \u201chighly unsanitary\u201d when people double dip, but I argued that we kiss multiple times a day so what difference does it make. \n\nHe made me feel so bad about it that I bought two cream cheese containers this morning, one that I can double dip in, and one he can use. But when he saw that I bought two, he FLIPPED out on me, stating that I\u2019m being selfish and if I just \u201cchange the way I apply cream cheese to my bagel\u201d, and eat \u201cbagels the way normal people do\u201d then we wouldn\u2019t be arguing every day. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s getting so mad about this, and why it\u2019s such a big deal\u2026 any insight? AITA?\n\nEDIT: He doesn\u2019t work, and is living by his savings at the moment. He\u2019s trying to find a job, but is kinda being picky with employment and has a minimal experience (also spends most of his day playing video games on his PC). \n\nWith that being said, I\u2019ve been buying mainly all the groceries for the past few weeks (minus little things like his deodorant or hair gel when he runs out), and I genuinely don\u2019t mind doing so while he figures out his employment. I work full time, 8am-5pm mon-fri\n\nI eat a bagel for breakfast every morning so I go through a cream cheese container within a week or so. And yes, I break a piece of bagel off, dip, eat, and repeat; I don\u2019t bite off a piece and re-dip. \n!THANK YOU FOR ALL THE FEEDBACK!", "created_utc": 1677694227, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fasio/aita_for_doubledipping_my_bagel_in_the_cream/", "score": 486, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are both very young, and maybe he just doesn\u2019t have experience not getting his way / making simple compromises with a partner. Either way, this is a dumb hill to die on. Hopefully it\u2019s a one-off.\n\nBTW - Keep eating your cream cheese the way you like, in your own tub. Buying two tubs of cream cheese was a good compromise.

Salsa?", "NTA.  I wouldn't be thrilled by my husband dipping a bagel into the shared cream cheese purely because I don't want crumbs in the cream cheese.

Thanks for the fond memories of sitting in the atrium or rushing through the hall to class with my bagel! \n\nSo I can understand a bit where he is coming from - even though you\u2019re not double-dipping because you\u2019re breaking pieces off, you\u2019re still leaving debris from your bagel behind. \n\nBUT you said \u201cno problem\u201d and solved it by getting your own cream cheese. \n\nFor me, the problem is solved.

Since it didn't though you have a tough choice to make resolve the problem with communication and get him to see how irrational he is being.\n\nOr do the same to him by being equally irrational.

You changed the circumstances.  He's upset that you didn't change your behavior as he desired instead.  That's controlling.", "NTA\nThis was a rollercoaster lol at first I thought you were actually double dipping in the cream cheese, which would be gross but you're not. And when your bf had issues about it you acknowledged his feelings by getting separate tubs. Why's he being unnecessarily mean and controlling about this? The language you say he uses to describe you is problematic. \"Eat like normal people\" and \"just change the way you do xyz\"... Considering you're footing the bill for things while he's not working and playing video games, please be careful here. You deserve respect and to be treated with kindness, is he like this with other things?", "NTA, idk why he's so upset by how you eat a bagel but it aounds like he's not exactly \"share a life with someone else\" material.\n\nPlus it's not double-dipping unless you stick the same piece you just bit back in.\n\nAs far as being upset about buying a aecond container, I could see him being stressed out about money since he's currently unemployed, but those are your groceries that you're buying. Yeah, they're for the both of you, but it's not his place to get upset about that. \n\nI hope he finds wotk soon, I'm sure that will help his temperment, but this seems like a personal issue he needs to work out that will carry over into other aspects of your lives eventually if not resolved.", "NTA. Unless you two are 'saving yourself for marriage' you've exchanged a lot worse body fluids than a little saliva.", "That is not double dipping. Double dipping is when you take a bite and then dip that same piece in, which would be disgusting. The best argument he has is not wanting crumbs in the cream cheese which ok, fair but like...you bought him his own.\nWhy tf is he so hell bent on dying on a hill so inconsequential?\n\nNTA.", "OK, I was all set to say Y T A, but the two cream cheese things solved the problem. I'm assuming you're pulling off a bite-sized piece, dipping, eating; pulling another bite-sized piece, repeat; and on and on. I think it's a little gross but he is being kind of weird about it. Does he not like to share dips, either?\n\nSo I guess NAH?", "NTA. If you really want to make his head explode drink straight from a bottle. \n\nHowever, I will point out that in a fine dining setting, how to proper handle the situation would be to a place  a small portion of the cream cheese onto the bread plate and then go to town on it (same with bread and butter). But at home, with your significant other? Only rules are the ones you make. Enjoy! :)", "I was gonna go for e s h but NTA and here\u2019s why:\n\n1) You aren\u2019t double dipping\u2026 Breaking a piece off that has never touched your mouth is not the same as biting then dipping the piece you bit back in.\n\n2) You bought him his own container since he claimed he was worried about contamination of the shared food supply. Now you\u2019re only dipping into yours. \n\n3) Uhhh what does he think happens when people liss each other? Because\u2026. \ud83d\udc40\n\n4) Yeah it\u2019s super weird the way you eat bagels and I wouldn\u2019t do this out in public like ever regardless of it not being germy but at home in your own supply there\u2019s no reason for you to change what amounts to one of those weird quirky things we all have that others find strange.\n\n5) Once he blew up at you after you bought him his own cream cheese it became obvious that this was about control. Run!", "> He made me feel so bad about it that I bought two cream cheese containers this morning, one that I can double dip in, and one he can use.

I'm going with NTA because when he objected you came up with a perfectly acceptable solution - personal cream cheese containers.  His reaction is weird and frankly a bit alarming. O_O\n\nSide note:  It is unsanitary if you are actually biting then dipping the bitten end back into the container - this absolutely DOES contaminate the whole container.  A micro-biology class will really open your eyes to this.", "ESH. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want the bread crumbs in the cream cheese. But buying two tubs is a reasonable solution. Getting genuinely angry over this situation is a bit of a red flag..", "NTA\n\nI personally don't dip anything into the main container. Bread has different expiration date than cream cheese. I just don't want to contaminate it.\n\nHOWEVER, no one has died from dipping into a main container. Buying two separate containers seems like a great solution. He complained, you were considerate of him and presented a solution, he needs to move on.\n\nThese are just normal things you figure out together when sharing a space with someone. More things will come up, but he should be understanding and willing to compromise on things.\n\nIf he's being mean and controlling the way you do things and making you feel bad, that's a red flag. This is cream cheese, not something huge.", "NTA  You learn how to compromise and live with some differences. You found a workable solution.  He no longer has any reason to complain. It's not a big deal.  He is lacking in maturity.", "Since you now have your own cream cheese pot, NTA. Perhaps you should keep your boyfriend away from all those other nasty germ-ridden bodily fluids while you're at it?", "NTA\n\nDouble dipping into a public container is gross.  Your boyfriend is right here.  Your solution is a good solution.  He gets his own, and you get one you can double dip into.  His tantrum about this solution is a control issue.  He wants control.\n\nAlso, how long are you going to support a jobless man who is picky about jobs and spends most of his time gaming?", "[removed]", "NTA you aren't double dipping if you are eating the whole piece after you dipped it. Double dipping is dip, bite, dip the same piece again after you took a bite. Even if you were, you've got your own container, he's just being neurotic and controlling at this point. If he's doing this over cream cheese, what else will he decide it's gotta be his way, or else?", "NTA. He\u2019s being weirdly controlling about how you eat *your* food. There is nothing wrong with you breaking the bagel apart and dipping it into the cream cheese that way. \n\nThis early in the relationship, his reactions feels like a \ud83d\udea9\n\nETA: To the people commenting on OP\u2019s gross/weird habit, what is the difference between that and double dipping a french fry?

Though I\u2019d seriously reconsider a relationship with someone who throws a tantrum because you double dip your bagel into your own separate container of cream cheese you paid for.

Like corn, some people eat it off the cob and some people cut it off the cob and eat it on a plate. What does it really matter how someone eats something? Given I\u2019m petty but if I were you I would tell your BF that he can either leave you alone about how you eat your bagel or you are going to get pickier about germs and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something you do for him (wink wink) that involves putting something with a lot more germs in your mouth.\n\nFYI, you should have titled it differently since you aren\u2019t double dipping (that insinuates that you take a bite and then put the piece you bit back in the container.

However,  everyone has their pet peeves that they really can get wierd about: it makes their brain squirm and it doesn't have to be reasonable.

Pet peeves rarely fade, but tend to get worse.", "If you are dipping a piece of bread that has been bitten by you spit side down into the cream cheese then that is gross and unsanitary and you should stop that.

The same with the happy hippos, mars, twix.. \n I also have a certain way of eating my meals. I need to take a piece of everything and put it all in one bite, but I also need to taste each ingredient separately. \nI'm not a picky eater, because I eat everything but my way! \n\nMy partner has never made fun of it, he even finds it funny to see me eat. \n\nI think NTA because you bought another container to respect him while pleasing yourself and he got mad anyway.", ">AITA for double-dipping my bagel in the cream cheese container?\n\n>I (22F) come from a small town, so my public high school was on the lower-end of \u201cmiddle class\u201d (graduation class of 27) so we didn\u2019t have the biggest budget\n\nThis reminds me of online recipes.

I figured out a way to eat a bagel in the morning by just breaking it into pieces and dipping/scooping it into the individual cream cheese containers, and that is how I\u2019ve always ate bagels going forward because it\u2019s just more convenient and less messy. Anyways, I just moved into an apartment with my boyfriend (21M) 2 months ago (for context, we\u2019ve been together for a total of 6 months) and when he saw me eat a bagel at home for the first time, he hinted at how weird and kinda gross it is that I \u201cdouble dip\u201d into the cream cheese container. But I rebutted that it was only us two living in the apartment, and certainly the only two using the cream cheese. But the longer I continued to do it, the more mad he got with me, saying how \u201che doesn\u2019t want my germs in his cream cheese\u201d or it\u2019s \u201chighly unsanitary\u201d when people double dip, but I argued that we kiss multiple times a day so what difference does it make. He made me feel so bad about it that I bought two cream cheese containers this morning, one that I can double dip in, and one he can use. But when he saw that I bought two, he FLIPPED out on me, stating that I\u2019m being selfish and if I just \u201cchange the way I apply cream cheese to my bagel\u201d, and eat \u201cbagels the way normal people do\u201d then we wouldn\u2019t be arguing every day. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s getting so mad about this, and why it\u2019s such a big deal\u2026 any insight? AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you eat spoiled food, you\u2019ll get food poisoning. These are facts. \n\nThere\u2019s not a calculator that tells you how fast your specific food will spoil based on the exact conditions your food has been exposed to. \n\nUnless you\u2019re going to provide links to back up your claim that it\u2019s not actually that harmful, you have nothing. You\u2019re providing nothing to me in your responses except the same questions over and over again.

Your body is full of them. The simple presence of \u201cgerms\u201d is not dangerous, much like the presence of water does not mean you\u2019re at risk of drowning in it. \n\nUnfortunately, I could not find any studies on the practical effects of double dipping. Only the 2009 one you\u2019re referring to (and some associated commentary articles) that show that bacteria does transfer, but was not designed (and did not) show whether this posed any actual risk, either to how long the food will be good for or to the health of people who eat it. \n\nTo my knowledge, there is no scientific evidence beyond that either way because it hasn\u2019t been studied, so we\u2019re both just speculating. \n\nI will note, though, that eating spoiled food = food poisoning is NOT a fact. Eating small amounts of certain foods which are spoiled is generally (not always) harmless. Again, it comes back to which organism (or related toxins) have contaminated the food item, how much is present, how much of it is consumed, whether it can be cooked off, and the resilience of the eater\u2019s gut."]}
