And we have not spent one New Year's Eve together.  She has a family tradition with her parents and siblings.  She is the oldest (24) and the only one to be out of the house.  We moved in together this July.  \n\nShe spends the Christmas holidays at her family's home. And since we are not married I'm not invited to stay with them. Well 2019 was our first one and I went back to my home town to see my family over the holidays.  20/21 were a write off. \n\nSo I thought for sure we would get to spend this New Year's Eve together.  We talked about it back in August and she said she was going to see her family over the holidays.  I could come since we were living together now but I would have to stay at a hotel.  \n\nI said I would just visit my family instead.  Well one of my friends invited me to go sledding over New Year's.  So a few of us are going snowmobiling.  \n\nWe rented an Airbnb and we are going to party.  \n\nMy girlfriend's family are terrible at communicating. Her dad made plans to take them to Hawaii over Christmas break.  Which is pretty sweet.  Except for it was a Christmas surprise.  And my girlfriend has an expired passport. \n\nSo they have been trying to get her an expedited passport.  I'm not sure they will succeed but I wish them luck.  \n\nMy girlfriend asked if she could come with me for the holidays.  I said she could spend Christmas with us but I was leaving after Boxing Day to go party with my friends.  \n\nShe is saying that in an asshole for not prioritizing her and leaving her alone over New Years. I said that she wasn't planning on seeing me over New Years and that I was her second choice.  I asked her if she would want to spend New Year's with me if her passport came through.  She said that wasn't the point.  \n\nAfter I checked with my friends I invited her to come sledding with us.  She doesn't like the cold and doesn't want to spend time alone in the Airbnb while we are out.  Plus she would be the only girl there. So she said no.  \n\nShe is pouting right now and saying that I'm being mean by not cancelling my plans.  \n\nHonestly this is throwing up some red flags I hadn't seen before.  \n\nBut with regards to making plans with my friends. Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1671873437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu68fc/aita_for_making_plans_to_spend_new_years_eve_with/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially since it isn't clear that she will even be available. She wants you to guarantee cancel just in case of the maybe scenario where her passport does not come through.", "NTA - You are right there are red flags I see from her and her family.\n\n\\- Neither she nor her family can communicate their plans properly\n\n\\- You've been dating for years and live together but you aren't invited to stay in their home? Fucking disrespectful. That is not normal, I would breakup over that alone since it shows your GF doesn't have a backbone to her family.\n\n\\- She expects you to change up your plans last minute to accommodate her.\n\n\\-  And you were kind enough to do so AND THEN SHE SAID NO??? AND IS ANNOYED AT YOU?? \n\n\\- So now the entitled gf wants you to cancel??? Once accomodation is already BOOKED no less!\n\n\\- Her family thinks surprise OUT OF COUNTRY vacations are okay. I wouldn't want to marry into that. (I assume you are not American, since Hawaii is in America and therefore you don't need a passport, just your driver's license)\n\n\\- GF let her identification expire. Shows lack of organization and preparedness.", "NTA\n\nDude wtf, her family is the problem. Not you. She's enabling their behaviour and punishing you for not going along with that.", "NTA\nYou even asked to bring her to a boys only trip. Thats cool. Shes so selfish. Just enjoy your trip.", "NTA. If you cancel your plans and stay home with her instead and she gets her passport you will be left sitting there with your thumb up your butt.  Marinara flags from this girl everywhere.", "NTA, she wasn't planning on spending new years with you, so you made plans. Now, since she might not be able to go on her trip, she wants to spend new years with you. But, she doesn't want to partake in the plans you made; she wants you to cancel those plans for her. If she really wanted to spend new years with you, she would partake in the plans you made, especially since you went out of your way to make sure your friends were cool with her coming. This isn't about you two spending time together it's about her exhibiting some control over you.", "NTA.\nShes being very childish and unreasonable.\nBesides, she is the one who organised (quite happily) to be without you. \nYou took it gracefully and made other plans.\nShes the one who stuffed it all up.\n\nGo and enjoy yourself. You have nothing to feel bad or guilty about at all. \n\nYes. Red Flags alright. \n\nWhat country are you from? Canada?", "Let\u2019s get this straight. GF is happy to leave you home alone for Christmas and NYE because it\u2019s her \u201cfamily tradition\u201d. However, when you make plans accordingly, and hers fall through, she upset that you don\u2019t change your plans?!\n\nIt\u2019s an AH move not to involve you and think it\u2019s ok! If I\u2019m serious about my partner and my family want to exclude them, then I would choose my partner to spend the holidays with, and not ride away in the sunset to celebrate with my family\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s hypocritical that now, that the table turned, she\u2019s upset. It\u2019s exactly the same situation what she had no problem with a couple of weeks ago, when you were the one staying alone. Now, all of a sudden, it\u2019s all different and unfair?! NTA", "NTA.  It's unfortunate that her plan A didn't work out.   But now she's asking you to cancel your plan A because her plan didn't work.  no", "NTA. no shade\u2026 BUT She sounds like a brat and not the fun kind. She was perfectly ok with ditching you for her family\u2026 and if her passport comes I think she will ditch you again. Let her pout with the fake FOMO. \ud83e\udd23\nOh\u2026 and her family ATA\u2019s for excluding you.", "NTA\nShe wants you to prioritize her, after she didnt prioritize you. If her passport come through, she will left you hanging anyway. And how cant you stay at her house after 4 years? You are practically married as you living together, isn't it normal to ask you to stay? Not necessarily in the same room (but you are not kids so thats okay too) but in the house", "NTA. If your plans fell through and hers didn\u2019t, would she even cast you a backwards glance? No. Her family are AHs too, maybe that\u2019s where she gets it from.", "NTA. How is it your fault that her plans fell through, and why should you be expected to cancel your plans because hers fell through? Red flag indeed.", "NTA. This is all because her plans fell through. Her parents should be the ones canceling their trip because they did not plan their 'surprise' well.", "NTA. Correct about the red flags.", "NTA. You\u2019re not wrong for seeing red flags here.\n\nAnd honestly, her family seems overly controlling and ridiculously old-fashioned.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019ve put in four years, you live together, and her family doesn\u2019t seem to be interested in making you feel welcome or part of the family. And your girlfriend treats you like a backup plan and doesn\u2019t seem to respect your time or other commitments. \n\nI\u2019d take this whole thing as an opportunity to really examine if this is what you want. 2020-2021 might have been a wash but it\u2019s four years into this relationship and her family won\u2019t even let you stay in their home and it doesn\u2019t really sound like she\u2019s interested in including you or making new traditions with you, unless it\u2019s convenient for her.", "NTA it's not your fault her passport expired so she might not have plans. You planned separately and you invited her with you. Your plans to go sledding sound awesome kinda her loss that she doesn't want to join if her plans are cancelled", "NTA. What a brat. It really sounds like she doesn't consider your feelings at all.  Not just with demanding you cancel your plans even though you could then be left high and dry on new yrs if her passport comes through but even in the way you're not welcomed to stay at her family's house after 4 yrs. That's very odd.  She's only thinking about herself; Hopefully that aspect doesn't carry through to other areas of your relationship.", "NTA but unless your guy friends have magical vaginas I'd not rub it in her face /s", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "She is being unreasonable. Just go abs have a good time. You offered to take her and only made plans after you were told you had to stay at a hotel. Plus , what happens if she gets her passport?  You are stuck at home now?  Selfish on her part.", "From the title this could\u2019ve gone either way but definitely NTA due to the circumstances. Enjoy your holidays!", "NTA\n\nbreak up with her spoiled and entitled self. You deserve better. Don't settle.", "NTA\n\nYou checked with your friends and invited her to come with you, if she doesn't like your plans that's her problem.", "NTA\n\nIt's her way or noway?\nThis is your future, if you want to keep the relationship set boundaries, if you don\u2019t want to fight for every decision you make break up with her.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nSo, your girlfriend ditches you constantly and her family doesn\u2019t respect your entire relationship basically and she is cool with that, her plans to leave you as usual this year are possibly going to be ruined, so she wants to be included in your plans, yet they don\u2019t quite appeal to her and so naturally she now wants them changed for her, but if that doesn\u2019t work out but above all you are not to leave her alone at all, and should cancel your plans at the last minute instead?\n\nI\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s the question?  \n\nTime to rethink the relationship.", "NTA. You thought she had other plans, you asked if she wanted to come along. But sounds like you guys need to talk.  Her family won't have you over and she's okay with that even after four years? You guys don't seem to be coordinating things.", "NTA, she sounds immature as fuck. You don't have to jump through any hoops just because of their improper planning.", "Well two of the boys are a couple. That's why I asked if I could bring her. It's not a single dudes party or anything.", "You are preaching to the choir.", "Canada.", "Ah okay ! You are right thats a different thing now. But anyways you did nothing wrong here. Maybe you can convince her to come and have a good time anyway. But you don\u2019t have to", "I know it can be tough after almost 4 years, but it may help to think back for any other red flags that you may have missed in the past and really think about if this relationship is something you want to continue with. No relationship is perfect, but some things are just too much. I wish you the best.", "depending where in canada you all are ppl have been sitting in planes on tarmacs for hours and hours and air cda and westjet cancelled hundreds of flights so her family may not be going to hawaii afterall"]}
