I will be using \"Baby\" instead of the gender. Ever since we found out that I was pregnant, we have told family and friends \"Don't kiss the Baby\". It was a rule for EVERYONE. \n\nThere has been a couple people who have done it, my mom, my sister, my Fianc\u00e9s sister, and just recently my MIL.\n\nEverytime someone has kissed the baby we have gotten on to them. And told them \"If you kiss Baby again you won't be allowed to hold Baby\", and everyone else quickly understood. \n\nNow onto my MIL. Almost as soon as she found out I was pregnant she was saying \"I can't wait to kiss Baby\" and my Fianc\u00e9 has told her no. She's also not been able to hold the baby much. She is a smoker and doesn't wash her hands after she smokes, and constantly smells like cigarettes.\n\nFriday, my FIL was holding Baby and gave Baby to my MIL without asking us first. But we were fine with it because she washed her hands before dinner and hadn't smoked since. Well in the process of giving our baby back to my Fianc\u00e9 she kissed our baby on the head. \n\nMy Fianc\u00e9 then told her she wasn't allowed to kiss the baby, and that she KNEW our rule. She them said \"It was just the head, Baby will be fine\". He then told her \"It's not your baby\". She then said something else, but I won't post that here.(Thats another story). \n\nThe next day my FIL defended her actions and said, \"Kissing Baby on the head won't get Baby sick, plus that is her grandchild\". He and my Fianc\u00e9 then got into a little argument.\n\nSince then nothing has been said about it, but now MIL is throwing a tantrum and refuses to talk to us.

The last two years have been TERRIBLE with RSV going around. Nearly every pediatric ICU in the US was packed to capacity all winter and it\u2019s only now starting to dwindle. You\u2019re doing the right thing and anyone who calls you \u201coverprotective\u201d needs to talk to some nurses or parents of babies who spent weeks on a ventilator.", "Nope nope nope NTA. My cousin gave birth and we weren\u2019t able to kiss her until she turned 6 months old which is completely understandable as now she has been outside and her immune system is a bit better. Not worth the risk especially with RSV going around.", "NTA - Your baby, your rules.", "100% NTA. People need to respect that that is your baby and you make the decisions for said baby. MIL and others can show affection in other ways.", "NTA 10000% NTA, but your MIL definitely is. It is your child, you are the parents. No one else. You set the ground rules, everyone else needs to follow them. My mother smokes and my husband and I refuse to spend much time at her house with our 9 month old because of the smoke. Babies are too tiny for our big germs. Period. You set your rules, you stick to them. If they don't follow what you set forth, that's on them not you. You're just protecting your child, your family. I applaud you for sticking to what you've set forth.", "NTA. Boundaries are needed. \n\nAnd babies do get sick from adults and kissing. I watched my niece struggle in a hospital with RSV.", "NTA - hold your ground. If they can\u2019t respect this small boundary they sure won\u2019t respect larger ones down the line.", "NTA. You make the rules regarding your child. Honestly that\u2019s one of the tamer ones I\u2019ve seen; perfectly normal to be protective of newborns like that", "I had the pleasure of welcoming 3 granddaughters (from my 3 oldest children)  into the world during the height of the pandemic. All 3 of my kids had the exact same rule that you have. No kissing the baby. It was definitely something I wasn't used to since that rule didn't apply when my older grandchildren were born. But as any good mother/grandmother would do, I respected their choices and commended them on standing by their choice to keep their child safe. Your baby...your rules.\n\nEdited to add NTA", "NTA but double down, you are 100% in the right and you need to set a precedent now that she does NOT get to break boundaries with your child", "NTA. If she can't abide by your rules, she doesn't get to hold Baby. If FIL is going to circumvent your rules by handing Baby to MIL, he doesn't get to hold Baby, either.  They can agree to your rules or face the consequences.", "Listen, I love playing with babies.  I have a kid, I am good with babies; I love \"squishing\", being silly w/ 'em, kissing their fat cheeks--But-- the parents get the say.  Period.  NTA.", "NTA, and if she\u2019s not talking to you, problem solved.\nI wouldn\u2019t want that gross cigarette smelling person holding my baby either. And I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s just a kiss the forehead, it absolutely can transmit germs. Don\u2019t touch my kid ever again.", "NTA.  Luckily, your MIL is voluntarily giving herself a well-earned timeout.  Your baby, your rules.  It's good to see your fiance is being a united front with you on your parenting decisions and boundaries.  \n\n\nIn your shoes, I'd extend that timeout she's started and let them know that stomping on your boundaries will get them additional timeout from seeing their grandchild.", "NTA.. As a \"Grammy\" I know it's so very hard to not kiss your grandchild. But it's such a necessary rule to have to keep your baby safe. \n\nI strongly recommend that you start sending her pictures and videos of babies that have been affected by RSV, herpes and other \"common\" \"harmless\" diseases. If that doesn't stop her; nothing will.", "Hey, if she refuses to talk to you, then there's less opportunities for her to stomp all over the rule. I'd call that a win. NTA. Your kid your rules, and breaking the earliest rules set just shows MIL will be less likely to adhere to other rules in the future.", "NTA I plan to have this same rule in place for everyone who holds baby. And smokers must wash hands before holding. It doesn\u2019t matter what relationship they have to baby, grandparents can carry RSV too.", "Gotta agree with everyone else, NTA. In these times of pandemics and anti-vaxers, it\u2019s better Safe than sorry. Plays it\u2019s your rule for your child, they can\u2019t accept it then they don\u2019t need to hold the child. What\u2019s the old saying? Actions have consequences", "NTA. Your child, not hers. She should have abided by the rule to begin with instead of trying to make herself an exception.", "NTA\n\nMy friends son nearly died because someone kissed him when he was a baby, and he ended up contracting a severe case of herpes that nearly made him go blind as well. It took several years for it to clear up.\n\nOutside of some exceptions that cause harm, what the parents say, goes. Nobody is entitled to your child, especially those who don't respect your rules and boundaries.", "NTA herpes (coldsores) kill babies.", "You and your fiance are being a little extra.  She's his MOTHER, and those people are your FAMILY.  I could 100% get behind you if it were random people who you have never met, But it's his mother, and a forehead kiss is better than a normal kiss.  \n\nLife is too short, Don't ruin a relationship over this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
