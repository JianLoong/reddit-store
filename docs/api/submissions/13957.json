She them said \"It was just the head, Baby will be fine\". He then told her \"It's not your baby\". She then said something else, but I won't post that here.(Thats another story). \n\nThe next day my FIL defended her actions and said, \"Kissing Baby on the head won't get Baby sick, plus that is her grandchild\". He and my Fianc\u00e9 then got into a little argument.\n\nSince then nothing has been said about it, but now MIL is throwing a tantrum and refuses to talk to us.

Not worth the risk especially with RSV going around.", "NTA - Your baby, your rules.", "100% NTA. People need to respect that that is your baby and you make the decisions for said baby. MIL and others can show affection in other ways.", "NTA 10000% NTA, but your MIL definitely is. It is your child, you are the parents. No one else. You set the ground rules, everyone else needs to follow them. My mother smokes and my husband and I refuse to spend much time at her house with our 9 month old because of the smoke. Babies are too tiny for our big germs. Period. You set your rules, you stick to them. If they don't follow what you set forth, that's on them not you. You're just protecting your child, your family. I applaud you for sticking to what you've set forth.", "NTA. Boundaries are needed. \n\nAnd babies do get sick from adults and kissing.

You make the rules regarding your child. Honestly that\u2019s one of the tamer ones I\u2019ve seen; perfectly normal to be protective of newborns like that", "I had the pleasure of welcoming 3 granddaughters (from my 3 oldest children)  into the world during the height of the pandemic. All 3 of my kids had the exact same rule that you have. No kissing the baby. It was definitely something I wasn't used to since that rule didn't apply when my older grandchildren were born.

Luckily, your MIL is voluntarily giving herself a well-earned timeout.  Your baby, your rules.  It's good to see your fiance is being a united front with you on your parenting decisions and boundaries.  \n\n\nIn your shoes, I'd extend that timeout she's started and let them know that stomping on your boundaries will get them additional timeout from seeing their grandchild.", "NTA.. As a \"Grammy\" I know it's so very hard to not kiss your grandchild. But it's such a necessary rule to have to keep your baby safe. \n\nI strongly recommend that you start sending her pictures and videos of babies that have been affected by RSV, herpes and other \"common\" \"harmless\" diseases. If that doesn't stop her; nothing will.", "Hey, if she refuses to talk to you, then there's less opportunities for her to stomp all over the rule. I'd call that a win. NTA. Your kid your rules, and breaking the earliest rules set just shows MIL will be less likely to adhere to other rules in the future.", "NTA I plan to have this same rule in place for everyone who holds baby. And smokers must wash hands before holding. It doesn\u2019t matter what relationship they have to baby, grandparents can carry RSV too.", "Gotta agree with everyone else, NTA. In these times of pandemics and anti-vaxers, it\u2019s better Safe than sorry. Plays it\u2019s your rule for your child, they can\u2019t accept it then they don\u2019t need to hold the child.

You\u2019d think a grandparent would want their grand baby to have a parent that looks out for the safety of their child.", "There are no major health risk differences between holding and kissing on the head.  If a person has COVID or other respiratory illness, your child will get the disease just by the person breathing while holding your baby.  Your baby is inhaling the air the person just exhaled.  You're not even talking about kissing the baby on the mouth.  How does the kiss add more risk?"]}
