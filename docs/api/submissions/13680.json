Did they agree with you? Not that it matters, but did they think you were too harsh?", "NTA- Feeling upset at splitting the check on a birthday dinner is one thing, but demanding that your partner pay for everything all the time no matter what is most definitely being a gold digger lmao. The truth hurts\n\nEdit for clarity", "NTA. Her comment was dumb and rude and she kept going. \u2018I just have to much self respect\u2019 wow", "NTA and both your sister and the bf are.

Your sister is living in 1950.", "Having a guy pay for all your dates is not having self respect! Oh my Gosh she's dumb! But not enough info for her being a gold digger. However I feel like you're NTA and your sister is arrogant, self-centred and a very bad friend.", "NTA. This is a classic FAAFO situation. Could you have avoided calling your sister a name that triggered her? Yes- but it also illuminated for her exactly how she comes across. People often react poorly when their actions are exposed for what they are, not how they want them to be seen.", "NTA. It\u2019s posts like this that make me even more grateful for the sisters I have.", "NTA. Your sister is the kind of \"woman\" that gives the rest of us a bad name.", "NTA. So I'm assuming if she wants her guy to pay for every single date, she is also cool with being barefoot, pregnant, wearing an apron and getting her man's slippers every night, since we are going back to the 1950's.", "YTA, your friend was literally complaining about how cheap her boyfriend was. Just because your sister called it out for the BS it is that a man would treat his lady that way doesn\u2019t make her a gold digger.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sad that your sister's idea of self respect is to leech off men, rather than becoming a strong, independent woman who can pay her own way.", "Looking on the bright side, you called her a gold-digger instead of a parasite.", "They were glad we finally got rid of her so we could go back to talking with that friend about what happened with her boyfriend.", "He didn't make her pay, he asked to split.", "Let me get this straight: according to you, a guy is cheap if he doesn\u2019t pay for every single date? Because that\u2019s what my sister was saying.", "Her sister was also going on and on about how a man should pay for everything.", "Ok, yea, if the other 4-5 people present were also annoyed by how she was acting, I think you telling her off was appropriate. She should know that this is how she's coming across before all her friends cut her off. It was very rude for her to imply your friend didn't have self-respect if she wasn't having her boyfriend pay for everything. She was being rude and very much displaying a gold-digger attitude.", "Some women think they are worth it. Obviously your sister is one of them. I was raised that a man pays on a date. If a man can\u2019t afford to take a lady out - he works harder until he can. Any dude that would make his lady split the bill on her birthday is disgusting. \n\nYour idea of gold digging seems to be much more liberal than mine.", "I mean, I can agree that the bf shouldn't be making her split the bill on her birthday, but the idea that the man mist pay for every date is ridiculous, specially in a stablished relationship", "[removed]", "\u201cSome women think they are worth it\u201d\n\n\nWhy? What makes you soooooo special among the other 4 billion women on the planet?

I don\u2019t think that makes the sister a gold digger. Annoying to keep on going on and on about it but definitely not a gold digger.", "NTA. Based on her reaction, I'd say you hit the nail on the head.", "LOL is your sister a subscriber to FemaleDatingStrategy? NTA", "No she is rude. I must say splitting the check on your birthday dinner doesn\u2019t seem to portend a great future.", "Hey having to date all those guys and convincing them you have a good personality is such hard work.\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29", "And in the same breath attacking her friend for\u2026not demanding everything be paid for for her?", "He made her pay for her own birthday dinner.", "No, he didn't. They went out and he asked her to split it.", "A birthday dinner is one thing but wtf does the man ALWAYS have to pay. Don\u2019t they deserve to be spoiled too? They can\u2019t ever be treated to dinner? This is the crap that slows progress towards equality. Men deserve to be spoiled and treated sometimes too", "On her birthday. You sound lovely if you don't see the issue with that.", "I am lovely, thanks. All the context we're given is that she's crying because her BF asked to split dinner on her birthday. That's it. Yet here you are projecting.\n\nFor all we know the BF just doesn't have enough money but still wants to spend time with her on her birthday.", "Then don't take her out. To make someone pay for their own birthday dinner is ridiculous and disrespectful AF. If you can't afford it then do something else that you can afford", "Again, you have no idea what happened. She could've been the one to say I want to go out to dinner.\n\nAlso, grow up. If you're an adult and you're crying to your friends because someone couldn't give you a free meal but still spent time with you then you sound immature.", "NTA if your sister wants live her life like that she\u2019ll have to find a man who will do it which prob won\u2019t happen. But the fact that she kept talking while it clearly wasn\u2019t helping your friend feel better was just stupid and rude.", "Sure making someone pay on their birthday for a .eal is real classy", "[removed]", "NTA. Your sister is.", "NTA. I would definitely red flag/break up with someone if they expected me to pay for everything. I also have too much self respect to make this demand from anyone I\u2019ve dated.", "You could also tell your sister that some women insist on paying half of the bill to keep the man from thinking he's bought more than the meal. They have too much self respect to allow toxic dates the leverage", "LOL \u201che didn\u2019t make her pay, he asked to split.\u201d Half of the whole bill is her paying for her own birthday meal. You seem like one of those guys who called themself a \u201cgood guy\u201d", "Respectfully, shut all the way the fuck up. Good lord. I'm not even the dude in the story, you people are just projecting your shitty opinions on me cause I said we don't know everything.\n\nLike they still went out and spent time together and she's crying cause they went dutch? Stupid. I've been Asked on dates before and have paid dutch, hell I've had to use the money I was given as a gift to pay for the food for my friends.", "NTA\n\nOne would think insisting to share the expense because you can IS the benchmark for self respect. Issue of getting good treatment on your birthday is entirely unrelated. She's only trying to convince herself because she has nothing else to offer (to the conversation)."]}
