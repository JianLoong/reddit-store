Important to note you did not rescind a gift that had been provided, you simply elected to go in a different direction based on feedback from your SIL.  She elected to bar you from your brother\u2019s party where such a gift would have been provided, if you had attended.  She\u2019s the only one angry, and the only one who excluded you.  She sewed, she reaped.  Too bad for her. Heck, no other adult even cares.  Gift was not revoked, wasn\u2019t even given.  Not even disclosed after long after.  Nobody can be mad for a gift never promised, not offered, and not given.", "NTA but sis-in-law definitely is. If she doesn't want you because of your lifestyle then she doesn't want your money (which funds your lifestyle) to taint her perfection. \n\nIt's good that fam is staying out of it but you may have to decide how much you're willing to tolerate long term to keep a relationship with your brother.", "NTA but gosh your SIL is off the charts. Don\u2019t blame you one bit. Hopefully your parents enjoyed the golf vacation.", "NTA, hope you got your money back from the Disney trip", "NTA. I feel sorry for your brother, but his wife created this issue, not you.", "NTA\n\nShe has no right to comment on how you choose to live your life. Its YOURS to live. She has no right to keep you away from your brother and nephews either. \n\nShe is TA. She doesn't want you around but wants you to spend on them? You are not the one robbing her of experiences, she is the one robbing you of your brother and nephews.\n\nAnd you took your parents? I love it sm.\n\nDude any person would be lucky to have you in their lives.", "NTA\n\nSIL f.cked  around and found out that there are consequences to be actions.", "Feels like a solid NTA. SIL clearly doesn't want you around, but wants your money after she learnt what it would have been going towards.", "NTA seriously why does she even know that about you? It\u2019s such a weird thing to care about when it would never intersect with her life. As far as her oh so innocent family is concerned, you are the single uncle. There\u2019s plenty out there.", "NTA From now on don't spend any money on anything that she would use or enjoy. Only buy stuff that the kids or your brother could use.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe blew it, she knows she blew it, and she wants to blame you instead of herself.\n\nYou didn\u2019t hang it over her head. You didn\u2019t even tell her. You planned a present, then backtracked when you weren\u2019t even invited to the relevant event, and found out from someone else. 100% in the clear.\n\nIf you\u2019re generally close with your brother, then he is also an AH if he was aware she didn\u2019t invite you to the party and went along with it.", "Wow she thinks it just because of an invite not all the other bullshit she spouts. She can save for her family experiences \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly? I think that is a good thing. Your SiL looks like a person who thinks that as a childless uncle you should provide for your nieces/nephews. She showed her true colors now, in mostly harmless situation. It would be much worse if something like this happened on a serious case, with rest of your family heavly involved and children used as a pawns. This incident give you an opportunity to set boundaries for future and no one can blame you.", "Nta. She's being a hateful person and that's what she gets. She doesn't even know you yet she's all about judging you and your lifestyle. You care for your brother and nephews which is what should matter the most but she wants to cut you out of their life. Seems like she doesn't want the best for your brother or her kids.", "NTA, plenty of siblings are polar opposites in lifestyle. She's just irritated because you chose the carefree life.", "Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you free child-care-included Disney vacations. SIL FAFO *hard*. NTA, even your brother knows it.", "NTA. If you want something from someone, don't cheese them off. Seems sister in law missed that memo in Grade school.", "NTA\n\nSIL doesn't get to enjoy the benefits of your money if she views your existence in your nephews' and brother's lives as a detriment.", "She\u2019s TA and the idiot. That\u2019s unfortunate for her", "NTA. As long as the kids don't know what they missed, it's all good.", "Clearly NTA.  Interesting that your brother is fine with you being excluded from his birthday party.  Seems the SIL makes the rules in that house.  This shows her to be two faced as your lifestyles enables you to give generous gifts to your family.", "Feel like I kinda have to ask but is she correct in her assessment of your life? Sounds over the top either way but it seems relevant somehow", "I feel like you dated a girl who was way too younger for you (thinking 19) and that's why they despise you so much.\n\nI mean there has to be more to it then they just hate me because I'm single and never settle down...Cough up, what else happened, lol.", "ESH\n\nHis wife sucks. \n\nYour brother sucks for going along with her not inviting you to his birthday party.
