SIL doesn't seem to get that when you would also have a family like them, your money would be going to your family, not hers. You might not even have the money you have now in the first place. At least now your brother and his children are reaping the benefits as well. But I would cut SIL off indefinitively.", "You're not the AH. Not sure why she's so concerned with how you live your life, since she's not married to you. You did the right thing.", "Goodness, NTA. Your SIL is enormously rude. What's it to her that you have a different lifestyle than what she would want for herself. She should mind her own business, or at the very least consider how well you go along with the rest of your family and what they think of your lifestyle and personal choices before she chooses to sow conflict with her actions and statements.\n\nOf course you can't be bothered letting her benefit from your funds when she says these things about you.

Wife says \"this person is not a good role model for our kids\"/\"this person is an alcoholic and it isn't safe for them to be around our kids\" and the husband folds, whether he agrees or not because he doesn't want to deal with the fallout or the possibility that wife takes it further if she feels strongly enough that she's \"protecting her children\".", "The context doesn't really matter in the end, because OP is right. If he isn't good enough to be around, then his money isn't good enough to spend on them. Even if he's everything she says, it doesn't change that she isn't entitled to his money.", "What context makes it acceptable to take somebody's money with one hand and talk about them behind their back with the other?", "!bot", "Well, they did tell her about the original gift.", "I would've changed the wife's ticket to be mime and went with them leaving their wife home..", "Just in time for the next party.", "I kind of am. Not the alcoholic part.", "OP provided the reasons in the post.", "The brother obviously agreed he didn't want OP at his birthday party, so fuck him. There is no Switzerland option here, you're either Axis or Allies.", "Brother doesn't value OP enough to want him at his 30th birthday.", "If SIL came saying she didn't want OP in her home but wanted him to pay for a Disney Trip, reddit would call her an asshole.", "Maybe he's just done constantly fighting his wife. She sounds insufferable"]}
