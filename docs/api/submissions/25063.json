We\u2019re barely above the poverty line and this will be a life changing opportunity for them.  Please don\u2019t punish them just because I\u2019m not entitled to your money. \n\nOP was bringing the grandparents too, so we will need  a vacation and Disney passes for 6 please.", "We don't have enough information about what has been said between brother and his wife, but I have no reason to assume he hasn't done that?\n\nThe impression I got was SIL took the initiative to tell OP she didn't want him around all on her own? I did not get the impression brother agreed to this, and I'm not sure he was even aware? I admit the story is somewhat vague. \n\nAlso, given brother is accepting the canceling without complaint when it must be very disappointing my guess is that brother is sorry for how his wife acted/realizes she was wrong. I assume SIL and brother have had a talk that others aren't privy to as a result. And while we don't know what was said, brother isn't backing his wife here."]}
