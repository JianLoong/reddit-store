SIL doesn't seem to get that when you would also have a family like them, your money would be going to your family, not hers. You might not even have the money you have now in the first place. At least now your brother and his children are reaping the benefits as well. But I would cut SIL off indefinitively.", "You're not the AH. Not sure why she's so concerned with how you live your life, since she's not married to you. You did the right thing.", "Goodness, NTA. Your SIL is enormously rude. What's it to her that you have a different lifestyle than what she would want for herself. She should mind her own business, or at the very least consider how well you go along with the rest of your family and what they think of your lifestyle and personal choices before she chooses to sow conflict with her actions and statements.\n\nOf course you can't be bothered letting her benefit from your funds when she says these things about you. But I would have wished for your brother to stand up for you, since she's treating you unfairly and it's a bit embarrassing. Her actions could hurt your relationship down the line, and I would have wished for your brother to see that and step up to protect your bond.", " Next time she acts spiteful and judgemental  about your lifestyle then tell her that if she is an example of what having a wife is like then you would rather spend the rest of your life single. \n\nI could understand her comments if you were around her kids constantly bringing random women into their lives or drunk/did drugs around them, not using protection and getting numerous women pregnant but you are not by the sounds of it.\nif she came from a caring point of view saying she wants to see you happy and settled and is worried you are lonely etc but she\u2019s not she\u2019s calling your choice of lifestyle disgusting.\n\nMe personally I would distance myself. I would take the extra cash that I would have spent on her kids and put it into a trust fund for them. Then they can have it when they are old enough to except it without their mothers say so. You say you want a good life for them so maybe this is a better way of doing that. It seems unfair for them to miss out because they have a horrible mother.", "She clearly sucks, obviously, but here\u2019s the thing, your brother sucks too. His neutrality re: his wife\u2019s disgust of you isn\u2019t great for someone you\u2019re supposedly close with. You\u2019re absolutely NTA but when you\u2019re vilifying her (bc she deserves it) you have to throw him in there as well bc he\u2019s not shutting this shit down", "You can't have your cake and eat it too. Don't bite the hand that feeds. Etc. You can't verbally be unkind to someone and exclude them while also expecting them to be kind, generous and inclusive towards you. I think you should stick to these new boundaries going forwards. \n\nIt speaks volumes that your brother was very happy and content with the voucher to his fav restaurant. I suspect your SIL is significantly jealous of how much money you have and discontent with her own standard of living. And that's why she goes so hard in painting you out to be this alcoholic womaniser. NTA", "I should pay you 5 dollars to write my college essays.. probably get a B", "Sounds like it was the wife who took the gift away from her family. Not only the vacation, but a brother and an uncle. \n\nWhy she thinks she should benefit from someone she doesn't even want to be around is an incredibalely selfish and shortsided view. \n\nNTA", "You're definietly NTA but i dont understand the reason your SIL hates you so much it seems weird", "NTA.  The sheer chutzpa of bitching at you for not splurging on gifts after snubbing you like that is amazing.", "NTA. If you are not invited to a birthday party, you don't have to gift the birthday person a present in my opinion. Someone can't expect a gift when they are so rude.\n\nAnd that is not even the case here as you gave your brother a $100 gift card to a restaurant, which is in my opinion a generous gift. \n\nAll the rest that you planned mostly profited people who didn't have a birthday, including your nasty SIL. She is so entitled and horrible that she wants money from someone she hates.", "NTA", "NTA.  Since you mention nephew (but not nieces), if I was in your shoes, I would be tempted to declare a \"boys only/male bonding holiday\" and go with your brother and nephews and leave her at home.", "NTA. But your brother really should stand up for you.", "Nta.  Your money your choice", "NTA, everybody is entitled to their opinion but not to dictate family interaction based on that judgemental attitude, in fact, if the family know what she said I am surprised she is not having flack from them for that.", "NTA\nIf she won\u2019t have you around her family, that includes your money. \nYour brother could grow a spine though.", "NTA she is and very judgmental", "NTA. And let\u2019s applaud the Parents and the brother here, they stayed out of it.\n\nThe SIL got what she deserved.", "NTA. \n\nI believe your SIL is insecure and afraid that your brother will see your lifestyle and become jealous of your freedom/ability to hook up.", "NTA", "NTA.  Maybe you can order him a backbone instead.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing my boy.", "INFO:\n\nMaybe she doesn't want you around so it'll be easier for her to control her attraction towards your \"bad boy\" vibes...", "NTA", "NTA\nand i love the response you gave her because it is true. She doesn't want you around, but she wants your money and what you can do.\nI understand your parents being a little iffy about the situation, but they need to take a big step back because it is your SIL who is ruining it for everyone.\nI wouldn't feel sorry for her or your brother, because your brother is allowing her to act like this and it doesn't seem like she is slowing down either", "NTA. Live your life how you want, use protection, have fun. If she doesn\u2019t want you around then she doesn\u2019t need your \u201cdirty\u201d money around either.", "I honestly love and respect that you work hard and know what you want. You\u2019re clearly NTA. You\u2019ve gone out of your way to take care of family and she doesn\u2019t appreciate your efforts.", "NTA. You probably are a degenerate drunk womanizer but that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s the lifestyle you choose and that\u2019s valid. It\u2019s just as valid as the choices your bro made. Your SIL can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA, and your family obviously knows it. No need to judge any different. She has the right to not want you around her kids (which is probably a dumb mistake) aber you definitely have the right to not go all out on a present if you are not welcome at the party. Your brother however might want to make the effort to work on his wifes opinion towards you. She is robbing their children of a part of their family and he doesn't seem to agree that it's the right step.", "NTA but your brother not stepping in when your wife uninvited you to his birthday party makes me wonder if he agrees with her", "haha one Christmas my partner won two open business class tickets to anywhere in network at any time (worked for the airline) He was going to give them to my sister and partner for Xmas, but I also had a small gift for her, I gave her it and she was so rude about it my partner just smiled and didn't give them the tickets, just said we have to go. NTA, no one has the right to judge your life choices and cutting you out of family occasions is particularly mean. if you're looking for a new brother..... lol", "NTA. I hope that your sister-in-law has learnt her lesson.", "NTA and I love the \u201cdirty money\u201d isn\u2019t going to be around her anymore, either bit. Absolutely love it. SiL is the one with the problem behavior which sounds like her moralizing is her expressing her seething  jealousy of your lifestyle and income. Good on you for not being an ATM for someone who badmouths you needlessly.", "hii, like ur totally in the right. If you brother is not involved and she is this mean to you for living your life in a not-so-conservative way she is free to book her own vacations.", "Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you free child-care-included Disney vacations.", "NTA i think it was the right thing to do.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good that the family is staying out of it to be honest. OP\u2019s brother should be standing up for him, it\u2019s his birthday party, he\u2019s the one who decides who gets to come.", "Next time take his brother on a brother's trip only, for sure.", "Dude I wish I had a cook ass sibling like you. Not that I want anyone to buy anything for me, but it would be nice to have a sibling that was actually thoughtful.", "She sounds jealous and want what op has as a life, not being tied down with h children. Thats why shes making all these assumptions about op, which none or true by the way.  And all the projecting and gaslighting is what shes doing", "She's beetroots and okra.", "Looks you're the uncle like OP though.", "NTA\n\nSIL is scared to death her husband will decide he'd like to have his brother's lifestyle and be free. She's certainly laying the groundwork to get him there!", "I hope if you ever give another gift like that you let her pay her own share.", "I understand your parents being a little iffy about the situation, but they need to take a big step back because it is your SIL who is ruining it for everyone.", "Or the dutch variant which translated says \"If you burn your ass, you get to sit on blisters\"", "Why did your parents tell SIL?", "My dads sister used to live a similar life. Worked all year, earned good morning then flew out Christmas day every year for a winter Xmas of skiing, shopping and tanning (on the way back) every year and in that shopping she would by me designer clothes and accessories. I barely ever saw her but she always sent presents to all us \"babies\" (I was the baby of my generation everyone else was my mums age so I got spoiled with the great niblings)", "Hadn't considered that but yeah, driving him straight out the door like that", "Why did you come here asking if you are the asshole, when you very obviously know you aren't?  Did SIL saying you should have given the original present really make you consider that she could be right? \nOr did you just need some validation and a place to vent about your unpleasant SIL? \n\nI just don't get why you're hung up on a person who *always* thinks you're an asshole for unreasonable reasons, calling you an asshole?  Like, that shouldn't matter to you at all, unless she's strong arming your bro into not letting you see their kids.", "Yeah, I'm surprised no one's mentioning a brothers week or something.", "Oooh, I love that one!", "Maybe because they wanted to punish her for her bad behavior. If they didn't tell her about Disney World, she could have continued in her belief that her rude behavior has no negative consequences. After all it seems her husband is not standing up for his brother at all, so she gets her way all the time.", "So why didn't his brother invite OP to his birthday if he loves him and why is he keeping out of this conflict?", "I would also ask the brother why she thinks op is a degenerate and alcoholic", "This is not good advice. I did this. She will just take advantage and as long as op spends life giving her things shel be great, but the second he stops shel be back to normal if not worse. \n\nI even tried continuing doing stuff for my newphews but that ended up in ungratefulness. Not to mention my sil continued saying bad stuff about me to anyone who listens.\n\nIf your brother can't stand up for you ,what you are doing is the only solution.", "Considering that the person wronged here is OP he deserves to know OP is backing him. Keeping what is said private when a third party have been wronged is just saying that you don't actually give a fuck about them. Or at least less of one than they give about their spouse. OP should take note of that and move accordingly in the future.", "He's probably not allowed to go. \nHe's not tried to invite his brother to his  birthday, he's staying out of this conflict, he's keeping his head down.", "You know this kinda makes sense. And i hope its true because someone needs to check sil. I mean her actions hurt at least 5 other people, not including her. \n\n\nHey op, is there any way you can do something for your nephews your parents and maybe your brother? Send them somewhere without sil? I feel bad for everyone....except sil. NTA, one bad apple and all lol.", "The brother chose the whole life occupation because he wanted to spend more time with kids. I guess he wouldn't want to spend a week without them, at least while they are still young.", "His parents got a nice golf vacation instead. His brother got that $100 gift card which is also generous in my opinion. Now only the nephews got nothing so far, but there are always birthdays and Christmas or other kinds of special days. Maybe drums or an electric guitar would make a perfect gift to them.", "OP said that his brother is \"staying out if it\". So he isn't backing OP either. Sorry but the whole \"I'm neutral/Not getting involved\" in cases like this, is bs.", "Yea, it's like standing next to a bully and not saying anything, then going for lunch with the bully. No, you're not neutral.", "Reddit is very 1D when calling for blood. \n\nBrother staying out if it is the best the brother can do. What is he supposed to do? Ask for a divorce because wife doesn't get along with brother? If SIL came her complaining about her end of things, reddit would side with her and call the husband a dick for not standing with her (aaaanddddd... tell her to divorce). And let's not forget there are kids involved.\n\nThe brother probably has a lovely relationship with his wife. He already confirmed that Op has an altogether different lifestyle to his brother. So asking him to pick the OP's side which could altogether wreck his otherwise perfect life (except for mild friction between bro and wife) is the stupid kind of 1D advice that makes reddit unreliable.\n\nAnd like somebody here mentioned, bro probably already had a talk with his wife. (Like matured pplel)\n\nFor OP's question NTA. \n\nThee rest of you stay out of it. Don't hyperbole into theories."]}
