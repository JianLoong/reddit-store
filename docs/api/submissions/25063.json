SIL doesn't seem to get that when you would also have a family like them, your money would be going to your family, not hers. You might not even have the money you have now in the first place. At least now your brother and his children are reaping the benefits as well. But I would cut SIL off indefinitively.", "You're not the AH. Not sure why she's so concerned with how you live your life, since she's not married to you. You did the right thing.", "Goodness, NTA. Your SIL is enormously rude. What's it to her that you have a different lifestyle than what she would want for herself. She should mind her own business, or at the very least consider how well you go along with the rest of your family and what they think of your lifestyle and personal choices before she chooses to sow conflict with her actions and statements.\n\nOf course you can't be bothered letting her benefit from your funds when she says these things about you.
