I proposed to her on our anniversary, just as I'd planned. She said yes, and we both cried. I love this woman, and I can't wait to marry her.\n\nAlso, my brother's single.\n\nA couple days after my post, my mom called me and apologized. After thinking it through, she realized that while I did threaten his relationship, my brother had brought it upon himself.\n\nShe confronted him the next day, and he ended up confessing that he wasn't going to propose until I said I was.\n\nMy brother is older, but I've hit many milestones earlier than him. He never seemed bitter about it. We've always been close and supported each other, which is why I was completely blindsided by what he did.\n\nFinding out I was proposing made him panic. He spontaneously said he was doing so too, but freaked out about picking an engagement ring and devised a plan that, according to him, made sense at the time: use mine and take his girlfriend to buy a new one later.\n\nThat plan was ruined when I said no, so he stole my ring. The new plan was to propose with it, take her to buy a new one, find an excuse to visit me the next day and discreetly return the ring to my apartment. I wasn't even supposed to know it was gone. That plan was also ruined, due to his girlfriend's immediate announcement. He knew she was doing it, but not that she'd show the ring.\n\nThen he got mad I made him get me a new ring, because he'd told his girlfriend he'd get her one too. So his plan to spare himself the effort of choosing an engagement ring would end up making him buy two.\n\nBasically, my mom got him to admit his whole engagement was a panic move. She said he already seemed embarrassed when they started talking, but was a wreck by the time they were done. She told him to apologize to me, and he called me an hour later to do so. He seemed sincere.\n\nMany of you said his girlfriend deserved to know the truth, and I agree. The only reason I hadn't done so was because I thought that should come from my brother. So I took the opportunity to tell him that if he truly loved her, he'd tell her the truth.\n\nHe did. I don't know much of what was said, but she dumped him. He gave me back the first ring and refused my offer to pay him back what he'd spent on the new one.\n\nAs some of you recommended, I waited two days after proposing to tell my fianc\u00e9e what happened. She was furious, but reassured me that she loved her ring more than any other. Since the first one was on sale, I can't return it to the store, so we're thinking of selling it.\n\nI haven't forgiven my brother. But because he's never done anything like this before, I'm willing to give him another chance. I'm going LC for now, he'll have to earn my trust back. I really hope he does. I love him, and I don't want our relationship to end over what he did. Both my fianc\u00e9e and my mom agree with me on this.\n\nThere's more I want to add, but the word limit's not helping. I'll try to reply to more comments this time.

Panicked that his younger brother is getting married? Panicked at the thought of picking out a ring? To the extent that he opted instead to literally beg, borrow, and then steal one?\n\nFear of judgment + low insight + imposter syndrome + general immaturity?

This one was a good history.", "Congratulations!!!!\n\nYour poor brother. His brain sprang a leak and it cost him his family\u2019s respect, a girlfriend he loved and the cost of a brand new engagement ring. \n\nKeep an eye on him or get your family to.

Hope y\u2019all can move past this! Congratulations on your engagement!!!", "Congrats on the engagement!", "Sheesh - he really made things so hard for himself. I know he said he wont take the money  but when you sell the first ring - just transfer the money to him, or take it over in cash and insist. Do go low contact for a bit until he does earn your trust but he's already lost so much - let him get some money back some how. He needs therapy", "This is very confusing.", "Your brother's fiance dodged a bullet.", "Does your brother spend a lot of time watching wacky, tv sitcoms?", "Congratulations OP!!!\n\nYour brother needs some serious therapy. He literally blew up his whole life over jealousy.

He knew she was doing it, but not that she'd show the ring.\n\nYour brother is kind of an idiot for this part too. Of course she posted photos of the ring. Anyone who announces an engagement is going to share photos of the ring. And if you dont share photos, that's the first thing anyone asks about if you tell them you're engaged: \"Can I see the ring? What's the ring like? Show the ring!!\"\n\nI hope your brother can work through his insecurities and improve both his own life and his relationship with you. And congrats on the engagement!", "Congrats on your engagement! I'd get downvote for this. But try to forgive your brother. He panic and did something shitty, but he seems to be remorseful as he confess and his apologies to you seems sincere. It's tough being the older brother when the younger brother outshine you all your life, but he pushed that aside and be supportive to you.

It sounds like it was a difficult decision for you to make, but your brother should also take some responsibility.", "She later said she didn't know what she was thinking, but I get that it was kind of a tough spot.

I didn't think she would, considering she was ok with the whole \"placeholder ring\" idea.\n\nWhat? A proposal with a placeholder ring ahead of a shopping trip is not at all unusual.

Good luck.  I would hate to go through something like this with my own sister but I know I wouldn't quite give up on her if I did.", "I agree with the LC when you need space emotionally to process it all and is understandable but consciously going LC when you want to talk to him just to teach him a lesson is petty. He's already knows he fucked up and it cost him his girlfriend and your trust. You said he's never done anything like this before &  he apologized and you think he's sincere. There isn't gonna be a sudden moment when you forgive him, its going to be gradually built up over time.", "The idea of a placeholder ring was weird to me, to the point I thought she just wanted to marry him that much.", "Same. She went from being engaged to single real quick. I can't imagine how much it must suck to get engaged solely because your partner is trying to race his brother and with a stolen ring. At least she got it before the wedding.", "Seriously, I'm not surprised she dumped him after he admitted that he proposed to her only out of panic to beat his brother to the punch with a stolen ring that was meant for another woman. Like, you get all excited that you are engaged, then realized it was never that your fiance wanted to marry you, he just wanted to beat his brother and was willing to stoop to theft to do it.", "He never had a key to my apartment. He stole the ring while he was visiting me and my back was turned.", "Absolutely, or OP can also give it to his fianc\u00e9e if she likes it? She can have two rings, one engagement ring and one normal.", "Maybe, but depending on how much OP originally paid, that's still money that can provide slightly nicer thing (like the dress), or pay for hotel/travel for honeymoon.", "OP has the initial ring back. I'm not sure what ring you're talking about here", "Whether this is true and what conditions have to be met varies wildly from state to state in the US and also varies from country to country.", "I wouldn't say it's the norm, but it's certainly not unusual, and I don't think it speaks particularly to an unusual desperation to be engaged.", "Ah, good to know.", "Personally I'd go NC with him. If he does something like this then who knows what else he would do. Either way best of luck in the future.", "Yup, she can have the first ring to use when they go on holidays and other places where she may want to be more careful with her real ring!

Also WTF.", "Congratulations!!", "I remember your post. I'm glad everything worked out. Hopefully, your brother takes time to work on himself. It is tough being the older sibling and watching your younger one hit all the traditional milestones.

I hope you will be able to work it out moving forward.", "Congrats! Sell the ring and put it toward your wedding", "Competition between brothers isn\u2019t a good thing.

But I\u2019m not engaged yet (fingers crossed for this year, pretty sure he bought the ring) so when I am I\u2019ll be doing the same thing. \nMy dad recently lost his wedding ring and weeks later my mom lost hers for 2 weeks (she found it under the seat in the car but my dad never found his.
