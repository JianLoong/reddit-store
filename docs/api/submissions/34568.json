He clearly has no id what a woman is going through in pregnancy. Some need more private time than before... That being said if his wife ist pregnant and needs more from him, is he going to reject her???\nWell good luck because he's going to get his ass beaten...\n\nYou just make u'r wife happy an congratulations for u 2...\n\nPs: in the late pregnancy sperm can help to start the birth contractions...", "NTA \n\n>the next thing he asked was how am I managing 9 months of no sex. \n\nHe needs to grow up.", "NTA.\n\nListen to your doctor, and find a new friend.", "Dude, the way you describe it... I too want to have sex with your pregnant wife /s\n\nBut seriously, your friend has some sort of insecurity and this irrational outburst is just some sort of symptom.\n\nLove your wife, enjoy this very special moment in your lives.\n\nEvolutionarily speking it totally makes sense to be attracted to your pregnant partner. Your brain is \"tricking you\" to be around and protect the person propagating your DNA.\n\nAlso is this a friend (if he will have kids) is not going to change a diaper or give his child a bath?", "NTA. You're both entitled to your opinions (I don't agree with his). There is no reason for him to get upset or level insults because you disagree. From what you shared you didn't appear to attack him. Perhaps he sees discussions as zero-sum games where there's a winner or a loser. None of it is your problem to solve. Keep loving that wife of yours, and congratulations.", "NTA. I feel sorry for his wife if she gets pregnant.", "Man, I find the thought of having sex with my pregnant wife even hotter, the fact that she is carrying our child, and all the sacrifices it entails (to her body) so that we can create a family unit is much more attractive than some rando with a hot bod.", "nta", "NTA\n\nwas he trying to say you're ... the unborn kid? in your wife...?", "NTA\n\nFriend is an idiot...", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t make him feel attacked, he might have felt attacked because of his own limited view on sexuality. There are many, many men who find their wives **very** attractive during pregnancy. He just doesn\u2019t have an open mind. He probably subscribes to that antiquated belief that \u201cthe baby might see\u201c \ud83d\ude44\n\nenjoy this time with your wife, it\u2019s a great time to bond. Congratulations to you both!", "NTA. Dude has some weird hangups.", "His is the most nonsensical take I've ever heard.  Quite common for the woman's libido to increase during pregnancy, and her sensitivity to rejection from body insecurity is pretty high too.  You could even damage her self esteem by holding out on her at a time like that.  That doesn't mean you should push for it, but by no means should you consider it a bad thing to be attracted to her and act accordingly.  \n\nNTA", "He is right though about pregnancy sex, you might get bitten by the baby !!", "NTA it's weird your friend's head would go there.", "NTA. Honestly, just sounds like he\u2019s been around influences that tell him wives aren\u2019t attractive when pregnant and all that. He probably expects it to be that way. Sometimes even if you aren\u2019t sexually attracted, there\u2019s the emotional love there and it is what stimulates the sexual attraction. I don\u2019t know what it is like for men but my guess is that he is probably struggling with the emotional connection with his wife for some reason, and this is a symptom of that. You\u2019re not weird for thinking that. He also is not a bad person for thinking that, but it\u2019s something that will need tended to otherwise it will affect his relationship with his wife. It would break my heart if my husband found me unattractive while I was pregnant\u2026 It would feel like a betrayal somehow. I think it\u2019s mostly because hey, we\u2019re sharing this extremely huge change together, and we\u2019re seeing it happen to my body and we\u2019re supporting each other through it\u2026 wouldn\u2019t that being emotional closeness and that intimacy every relationship needs?", "NTA", "NTA, I don\u2019t agree with him either and he sounds insecure as hell. Seems he envies your relationship. Is he single? If not then I don\u2019t know why he took it like that.\n\nEdit: Seeing now that you said he\u2019s married yea I don\u2019t know what his problem is", "YTA\n\nShush FGS. Don't discuss your sex life with your spouse with people! It was none of his x@#% business!", "NTA, dude, I would almost say I've never found my wife more attractive than when she was pregnant. (Almost) That guy is broken.", "Is his name Elvis ?", "NTA. Your friend has major issues and you are well-adjusted", "NTA. your friend escalated that rather quickly.", "NTA the other guy is an idiot. 100% when my wife's pregnant for as long as its still (mutually) enjoyable I want to keep having sex.", "Thanks!!!", "I like to keep him around to stomp him in Magic", "People do tell me that I sometimes tend to talk in a way that sounds like I\u2019m grandstanding. He being one of them. And I admit that my wife tells me the same too.", "Yeah. He thinks that having sex with the wife means having sex with the fetus. Because he has the mind of a 12 year old.", "Thanks!", "He too is married he wrote", "Lol he asked me", "Sounds like his friend was the one who brought up sex.", "Sometimes the waifus on the cards make it not hard for that to be top of mind", "U'r welcome \ud83d\ude04", "Grandstanding can indeed be annoying at times, but it isn't synonymous with attack and doesn't warrant being called a sexual deviant. Loving and being attracted to your pregnant wife is a good thing.", "So you must answer personal questions? You're an adult -- someone asking about your sex life does not require an answer.", "He doesn't have to answer personal questions.", "Do you think that adults can\u2019t talk about sexual issues in a healthy way?  Why should basic discussions be taboo?\n\nIf they are having an honest conversation, and not some salacious conversation, what is the problem?\n\nI think part of the problem with people being like the OP\u2019s friend is that any honest discussions are considered taboo.", "He gave a pretty safe basic answer, then the friend kept pushing."]}
