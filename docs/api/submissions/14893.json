Your brother and his wife are huge AH's, to be honest, they don't sound worth having in your life.

I'm a Christian but my family had many Muslim friends and the one problem we had wasn't due to a conflict of faith but rather because one of them happened to call my mother a very bad name.

I\u2019m in the dog industry (I work as a dog trainer part time) and I\u2019ve never heard of everyone being encouraged to bring their dog to a wedding.

Even before you said anything about your fear of dogs (entirely justified, by the way) you weren\u2019t the AH by fiat of this being a terrible idea with a fairly high chance of failure.

You should have done so before the wedding, but now that you're family, it's even more important.  \n~  Your twin brother should have known you well enough to know the wedding was going to be hell for you, due to the theme alone.  \n~  You should have at least TOLD them you weren't coming any more when you found out the theme, so they wouldn't be going to unnecessary steps for you.

Not telling a guy who lost a limb to a dog that there were tons of dogs at his wedding .", "Oh, please. The brother and SIL were way more TA than op.", "No, I'm using logic. And what OP wrote in comments. \n\nThe wife went out of her way to make sure her wedding was centered on OPs trauma and make sure he didn't know about it. I have no idea why you are trying to spin this so that the wife isn't the AH.", "You literally just said him not attending isn\u2019t what makes him an asshole, and now him not attending does make him an asshole just because he didn\u2019t say anything when they didn\u2019t say anything to him???\n\nSo either he\u2019s NTA for not going or he is TA for not going. Which is it?", "Muslim women go to school in the US and other parts of the world. Assuming all Muslims are anti-women is like assuming all Christians go around stoning people.", "dude what's your damn problem? why are you unloading this shit on a nonpracticing guy who happened to be raised muslim? haven't you got a better place to rant at?", "i agreed, onus is on the brother who knew OP history, that being said OP inst excused from not saying that he wont come, if OP doesnt respec family(which is fine) he should had went NC when he had issues with brother wife, which are petty IMO(\"makes more money\" lol)", "we are here to judge OP actions, not those around him", "TBH. From the sounds of it, OP\u2019s traumatising event w the dog has left a permanent, visible \u2018mark\u2019 on his person, there\u2019s no way you get to the point of marrying someone without knowing what happened to their TWIN brother that left him that way. \n\nAlso if you\u2019re marrying an ex Muslim it\u2019s a bit strange to me to make your wedding theme \u2018dogs\u2019 in the first place but maybe that\u2019s just me", "Context, inter-related conditions can make it so that he is the AH for not going because he didn\u2019t tell anyone. Just not going alone can have multiple conditions tied to it. Get it?", "He stated that she looks down on him for how much money op makes rich religious people can be aholes.  That's what the makes more money comment ment .  I'd hate someone for making more money than me man or woman for being one of those rich snooty types\n\nI'd suggest reading all his comments on it she doesn't sound like a decent human to poor folks", "There's literally a ruling ESH (Everyone Sucks Here) for doing just that."]}
