Anne has always been good with money and spends it on things she actually needs, and will occasionally treat herself to a few books or a treat. The rest she puts aside and saves. She doesn't save it for anything specific, she just doesn't have a use for some of it. Dylan hasn't ever really been too great with money, he'll spend poorly and buy things he doesn't need or use. \n\nRecently Dylan blew his gift allowance on something for himself, which he used for 6 days, and then got upset when the store wouldn't let him get a refund. Of course I tried reasoning with the store because they had a 30-day-return policy, but they said that once the packaging was damaged they couldn't refund it. \nWe went shopping for gifts today, and since the Christmas party will be small, Anne found it easy to buy everyone small gifts. She made sure to write down everyone's interests so she can make sure they'll use it. But, she also set a 'gift budget', which included the gift allowance gave her, along with some money she saved up.\n\nDylan wanted to buy himself a game which he couldn't afford, and turned to me for help. I told him I couldn't help him because I couldn't afford it and that it wouldn't be fair to Anne. He started throwing a fit because I was constantly being unfair to him by spending more on Anne. (Now I should add that this isn't a favourites thing, and if necessary, I'll explain why) \n\nSo, I asked Anne if she'd help him out and she simply said no. I told her that it'd basically be like her Christmas gift to him, and she argued that she already bought him one, and that the last of her money was going to her grandfather's gift. Which was far more expensive than anyone else's gift, she bought him these fancy overpriced headphones with a long aux cord that is supposed to connect it to the TV due to his hearing problems. We argued for around 15 minutes and she said that it's ridiculous that I'm arguing with her about this in public. I got angry and said that he isn't even her real grandfather. (he's my stepfather, I still don't consider him anything of mine. But to be fair, he was the only grandfather that stuck with my daughter after we found out she has psychological problems). \n\nShe started crying, paid for the gift and stormed off to the car. Dylan just kept begging me for the gift and started calling her selfish when we got back to the car. I told him to be quiet for a moment and tried calmly explaining to Anne that it was important to Dylan and she did have the money to afford it. She argued that it was her money, that she saved up, and it wasn't my place to tell her what to do with it. \n\nI just think siblings should help each other out where they can, that's the way I grew up. Some of my friends agree with me, some are telling me I'm an AH, and Anne's father called me just to tell me about how big of an AH I am. \n\nI need an unbiased opinion, so\nAITA", "created_utc": 1670804501, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjg50r/aita_for_asking_my_daughter_to_help_out_her/", "score": 626, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is not how you raise a well-adjusted human who can handle their finances responsibly. \n\nNow is the time for your son to learn that blowing all his cash immediately means he can't get anything he might want more later on. The stakes are lower now than when not having learned this lesson means his electricity gets cut off. (Or do you think Anne should bail him out indefinitely?) \n\nMeanwhile, the lesson you're teaching Anne is that you blatantly favor your son and that her saving means you harp on her to give her brother more of her own money. How exactly do you see this dynamic playing out in 20 years? If you see anything but a resentful daughter who doesn't spend much time with her family, you need to take off your rose-colored glasses. \n\nFinally, what's this about Anne using her money for things she actually needs?

How does a 13 yo understand budgeting and gifting better than you? \n\nShe took the time and care to note everyone\u2019s interests then managed her allowance (gift and otherwise!) to get each person a gift that suited them. \n\nInstead of teaching your son important relational skills, you are showing him that his actions have no consequences and his wants should be prioritized regardless of the circumstances. This is entirely a favorites thing. Can\u2019t be explained any other way. \n\nThe only new budgeting technique you are teaching your daughter is how to limit her emotional availability for you and her brother. Don\u2019t be surprised when she puts this emotional budget into action to save herself the mental toll of being around you.", "YTA for several reasons\n\nStop enabling your son and teach him that him spending his money on worthless things has consequences.\n\nYou're also the AH for trying to say she shouldn't be spending money on her grandfather because you don't consider him to be anything of yours (wtf?). He IS your child's grandfather REGARDLESS of how YOU feel. And her gift for him seemed to be very thoughtful and useful.\n\nMaybe you should teach the brother about using his money to help other people out instead of being selfish and wasting it - rather than trying to teach your daughter she should sacrifice herself for her brother's dumb choices.\n\nEDIT: AND You're an AH for trying to compare you spending money on your daughter's medical conditions to spending it frivolously on your son.

Anne has always been good with money and spends it on things she actually needs, and will occasionally treat herself to a few books or a treat. The rest she puts aside and saves. She doesn't save it for anything specific, she just doesn't have a use for some of it. Dylan hasn't ever really been too great with money, he'll spend poorly and buy things he doesn't need or use. \n\nRecently Dylan blew his gift allowance on something for himself, which he used for 6 days, and then got upset when the store wouldn't let him get a refund. Of course I tried reasoning with the store because they had a 30-day-return policy, but they said that once the packaging was damaged they couldn't refund it. \nWe went shopping for gifts today, and since the Christmas party will be small, Anne found it easy to buy everyone small gifts. She made sure to write down everyone's interests so she can make sure they'll use it. But, she also set a 'gift budget', which included the gift allowance gave her, along with some money she saved up.\n\nDylan wanted to buy himself a game which he couldn't afford, and turned to me for help. I told him I couldn't help him because I couldn't afford it and that it wouldn't be fair to Anne. He started throwing a fit because I was constantly being unfair to him by spending more on Anne. (Now I should add that this isn't a favourites thing, and if necessary, I'll explain why) \n\nSo, I asked Anne if she'd help him out and she simply said no. I told her that it'd basically be like her Christmas gift to him, and she argued that she already bought him one, and that the last of her money was going to her grandfather's gift. Which was far more expensive than anyone else's gift, she bought him these fancy overpriced headphones with a long aux cord that is supposed to connect it to the TV due to his hearing problems. We argued for around 15 minutes and she said that it's ridiculous that I'm arguing with her about this in public. I got angry and said that he isn't even her real grandfather. (he's my stepfather, I still don't consider him anything of mine. But to be fair, he was the only grandfather that stuck with my daughter after we found out she has psychological problems). \n\nShe started crying, paid for the gift and stormed off to the car. Dylan just kept begging me for the gift and started calling her selfish when we got back to the car. I told him to be quiet for a moment and tried calmly explaining to Anne that it was important to Dylan and she did have the money to afford it. She argued that it was her money, that she saved up, and it wasn't my place to tell her what to do with it. \n\nI just think siblings should help each other out where they can, that's the way I grew up. Some of my friends agree with me, some are telling me I'm an AH, and Anne's father called me just to tell me about how big of an AH I am. \n\nI need an unbiased opinion, so\nAITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
