When you are pregnant you feel responsible for your body, you pray that your body won\u2019t fail you and everything will work out and basically her worst fears were realized three times. A therapist could help y\u2019all work through that because playing the blame game won\u2019t help and even though she started it and that is not okay, you probably struck a much harder nerve with your comment about her uterus because trust me she feels that every day in a way I doubt you can truly understand. She needs to process her guilt, her sorrow and mourn the losses and y\u2019all need a fertility doctor who can help you sort out the why so she\u2019s not (and you aren\u2019t) wondering and you can have a successful pregnancy.
