This was right around the time CD's were out but cassettes weren't obsolete yet (aka if a band released an album, you could find it in either format) so I was thrilled to get it...*however*. It needed batteries, which were not included, and my parents **never** bought them because spending any money on their children was a \"waste,\" and batteries for children was doubly so. The device didn't include any tapes (some at the time came with one), but the 2nd gift was an audio book. The abridged version of The Bourn Identity. Not really appropriate for a 10 year old. My birthday is in the fall, so it was almost a year before I got money to buy batteries on my own (I was laughed out of the room multiple times/years for daring to ask for any kind of allowance, from any relative, in exchange for yard work or my regular chores (plus doing my brothers because he was and is less than useless) and my dad would have set me on fire before he'd even consider allowing me to take *his* shovel/rake to try to do chores for neighbors.)\n\nEvery other gift I got that year and for **every year until I was 19** was either a sweater (which I actually loved as it was the only time any clothing besides underpants was purchased new for me - I love secondhand clothes, even as a kid, but *never* having new anything gets depressing, *especially* as a kid), or 'bathroom sets' - aka a bag/basket with lotion + bath salts/beads + bubble bath. Nice, but not at *all* personal, thought out, or in my case, useful, because my dad would punish me if I was in the only bathroom in our house for more than 20 minutes. Also the bath sets were given by **every relative** during this time, and NOBODY needs 6+ sets every year (all grandparents divorced, I had multiple Christmases each year as no one could stand anyone else).

And again, the right sentimental gift can be nice- but I'm not a lover of all sentiment the way she is. the system you have devised would leave us all unhappy.", "This example shows again how wrong you are. If someone made a home made gift then based on your system (which is wrong) you should be making them a home made gift they would enjoy", "So the first person who found out was upset. That maybe tells you something.", "No, it's not necessary to convey your own opinion of yourself.  You're here for judgment, not to persuade reddit to see it your way.  Rationalizations for your actions are immaterial.  \n\nThoughtfulness is not your motivation.  Your desire to achieve a calculated parity is your motivation. \n\nAnd btw, a thoughtful person wouldn't need any these things laid out for them by a stranger on the internet.", "Is your motivation for being thoughtful because you care about those around you? That's a great quality to have .And because you care, you shouldn't keep score. Your thoughtfulness isn't wasted on those who may be bad gift givers.   \nKeeping score makes it seem as if you're trying to shield yourself from a future hurt. It's very judgemental, and isn't keeping with your thoughtful attitute- because it's not being caring.", "People are upset that the first thing you think of when receiving a gift is that you need to judge it at all. They're upset that there's now an invisible metric that they need to compete with in order for you to deem them worthy enough of receiving a gift that doesn't suck in return. Before they at least believed that you put an equal level of consideration into each of their presents, now that isn't true no one is probably gonna wanna spend time getting you something that you might judge poorly and they'll probably just get him gift cards or something.", "So when you were young, it was dismissed as a cute quirk but now that you\u2019re an adult attempting to have adult relationships, not working so well.", "Hey buddy? That means it\u2019s not working well.", "You sound like my uncle after my aunt left him when she found out he was cheating on her. His exact words to her were \u201cI was happy, you were happy, she was happy. The only thing that\u2019s changed is now you know about her, and suddenly everyone\u2019s unhappy. Why can\u2019t we go back to everyone being happy?\u201d", "What did she give you that rated a 5?", "Maybe the next time you balance your books you could at least be discrete. Sitting with a notebook in front of you and recording these ratings is super obvious and rude. Ever heard of a mental note? Also YTA", "Wow your life must be so miserable", "Get therapy", "Your attitude sucks.", "Lol have fun being single most of your life once people realize this is how you think. YTA.", "This is what I say about gifts. I love buying gifts for people. I work hard at picking out perfect gifts for every person in my life. I make a lot of gifts, too. I tell people that they don't have to buy me anything unless they want to. A gift is only enjoyable if both parties are happy about it (the giver and the reciever). I get gifts for people who don't buy me anything. It's just what I do. \n\nI would try to look at it from this perspective. Your not an ass for trying to keep things even, but it seems like you are not enjoying the gift process and, in that case, don't bother doing it at all.", "There is seriously something off about you. This is not normal at all. Actually quite disgusting behavior.", "If this is how you feel you have serious mental issues that need to be addressed.", "No, it really isn't and it's sad that you think this way.\n\nThe best people on earth are selfless and give generously of themselves without any expectations in return.", "\"I'm more thoughtful than others\" man you're kidding yourself. I haven't met anyone this delusional in a long time, so congrats!", "That is the saddest thing I\u2019ve read here.", "People are being kind of harsh with you lol and to be fair I don\u2019t disagree with you being in the wrong here but I\u2019m just saying that this transactional attitude towards it reminds me of what I do (a little less consciously)\u2014once I was diagnosed as autistic my relationships started making a lot more sense\u2026 have you considered being evaluated similarly? There\u2019s a lot of really creative thinking here and I get the urge for true reciprocity but it is a bit neurodivergent IMO :)", "No and it's weird you think that with such confidence.", "That's still not the same level", "So you\u2019re saying they only love you to the amount of the gift they give? Therefore you only need to give them back the same amount of love?", "I\u2019m also neurodivergent, so I kinda love it. But I do see how allistic people could be offended. I\u2019d also just like to offer up that in many cultures there is a similar process when it comes to gift giving. Not the western one though, so know your audience.", "Oooo I didn\u2019t see OP\u2019s comments! Thank you!", "Yup, some people are just absolute donkeys", "Nah, you're good. Civil convos at their finest ;)", "I am female!  Or at least, I was born as one, and identified that way when I was diagnosed (I indefinitely as genderfluid now lol).\n\nIt definitely made things a bit harder but if you find the right doctors, it's worth it", "Came here to say the same thing. I'm horrible at guessing what people want. If I gave them a gift card, I'd feel it was really thoughtful because then \\*they\\* could get something they really wanted. I always feel horrible anyway because nobody likes gift cards (and OP even says it's low effort and gets 'taxed' in this crummy system). \n\nBut what \\*I\\* like versus what other people like isn't going to line up. I get genuine joy from office supplies, but only certain ones. I like mechanical toys. I like paper. (I am on the spectrum, if anyone was wondering). Which means cool things other people get \\*me\\* are also a problem, because the texture might be wrong, or the ink flow isn't smooth, or whatever. \n\nOP, you sound joyless because you write \\*exactly\\* what you personally have rated that person's gift without considering where they came from - if they had no idea what to get you, or got you something based on need, or were just thinking you'd get a kick out of it, or just had other things going on in life, or not enough money. You don't consider if they really thought you'd love that thing or if they just sincerely don't know what to get you. There's no mention of anything outside \\*yourself\\* in your rating scale and there can't be, because you \\*don't know\\*. YTA and you made gift giving a misery for anyone who feels like they have should get you a gift in the future, knowing they're going to be judged on your made up nonsense scale. \n\nYou're not thoughtful and you're not being reasonable, and there might be a reason for this (being on the spectrum or some other thing) but you keep arguing in the comments that this is a rational thing to do and it's not. Listen to the comments and go to therapy, if for nothing else than to learn a few ways to be more communicative about needs and wants and reciprocating both to a reasonable extent from the people around you.", "I'll elaborate a little more on this, a truly thoughtful person would be thoughtful regardless of the level of thoughtfulness in return. Giving a gift of similar quality or usefulness doesn't equate thoughtfulness. So while no, usually people who truly are don't go around stating it, it's not bad to think or even say you are. If you actually are. But deciding to be in exchange for someone else being is essentially bartering. I give you $5 you give me something worth $5. I give you something 4.2 on your rating scale you give me something 4.2.", "I don't think my age is what caused the conflict.", "It's worked 99% of the time, so I think has.", "\"I think she's just upset that she got a 5.6/10\"\n\nLike he can't even possibly figure out why others are upset that he's *rating their gifts* in front of everyone, after bragging about how \"thoughtful\" he is?", "yeah, I'm not on the spectrum (I do have ADHD, which has some overlapping tendencies), but I did recognize a little bit of me in this, too. Not an elaborate system, but I never want people to feel offended or like I put less effort (or money) into their gifts than they put into mine, so I used to have a lot of anxiety about \"matching\" someone else's gift output.", "It is to me and my mom.", "thank you for your input!! i really do want to try but i\u2019ve never known where to start, or whether or not it\u2019s worth it, i\u2019ve definitely been thinking it is though, now that i\u2019ve reached \u201cadulthood\u201d at 19", "I think the most thoughtful thing I can do is create an even exchange. Once, when I was 15, I gave a friend a box of chocolates for the holidays, and she gave me a lollipop. Later on, I asked her what she wanted for her birthday, and she explained to me that she didn't want to exchange gifts because she felt bad about not giving me gifts of the same effort that I put in for hers. \n\nI didn't care what I received; I appreciated what I got either way. However, this made me realize and reinforced my belief that people get uncomfortable when they receive more than they give.", "At what point do you plan on processing that it\u2019s going to work 0% of the time from now on? I have a feeling those were your last gifts to rank.", "Exactly, yes! I don\u2019t rank it like this but this is very much a social activity that I do a lot of \u201cmasking\u201d around to make sure I\u2019m being totally appropriate", "I doubt she saw it that way", "How do you know your mom agrees with your metrics if you have never shown her the system? \n\n\n\nYou don't tell people that you think they a thoughtless. Your mom probably doesn't tell you that choosing a vacum fornher she has to use is a dangerously (as she has to use it often, but might have wanted a different one) boarding bad to insulting (gifting cleankng supplies is like gifting a weight loss book or simple soape) gift. \n\n\nAre you sure your mom is not just more loving and polite than well... you?", "If you live in the US, getting a psychiatric referral for testing would be a good place to start?  Maybe?\n\nEta, I was diagnosed at 14, and went througha whole bunch of tests. But I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression at the same appointment i got diagnosed with autism so I'm not entirely sure what I was all tested for, tbh \ud83d\ude05", "Most people are just deeply grateful. You\u2019ve created an entire system because when you were a kid one person reacted oddly to you. YTA", "It\u2019s not being thoughtful though. Being thoughtful means you\u2019re thinking about what they would like as a gift, what would make them happy, without taking into consideration how much \u201cthoughtfulness\u201d they deserve because of their own gift. You\u2019re not actually gifting, you\u2019re paying them back for what you thought you got was worth. That\u2019s not the spirit of gifting at all.", "This is an interesting incident, and your method of gift rating is, indeed, interesting. But is it kind?\n\nYour priority is equity, which I find, quite honestly, repulsive. I'm not you, though. My judgement is that YTA, but I'm using my own filter for that, which is of course, the only filter I'm prepared to use.\n\nYour big issue here is being found out. You should have hidden it better. I don't necessarily have a problem with your process of equity and balance (in regards to your own transactions with loved ones), but the transparency of such a system. Some stuff you have to keep to yourself.\n\nI echo the other responders in wondering if you are on the spectrum. No judgement there, neurodivergence is not a shameful situation to be in (or at least it shouldn't be), but it can sometimes produce difficult interactions with the neurotypical. Getting a diagnosis might help navigating these situations.", "Thoughtfulness is taking yourself OUT of the equation and focusing solely on the other person. \n\nGiving gifts based on what you've received is making it all about you. That's the opposite of thoughtfulness.", "So because one single time someone had anxiety about a gift you gave them- you should create a transactional system for everyone! I bet everyone loves that! Because every single person in the whole entire world thinks \\*one\\* way.\n\nExcept you, of course. You're the one single thoughtful person who would have been appreciative either way. You're just \\*that\\* special."]}
