This was right around the time CD's were out but cassettes weren't obsolete yet (aka if a band released an album, you could find it in either format) so I was thrilled to get it...*however*. It needed batteries, which were not included, and my parents **never** bought them because spending any money on their children was a \"waste,\" and batteries for children was doubly so. The device didn't include any tapes (some at the time came with one), but the 2nd gift was an audio book. The abridged version of The Bourn Identity. Not really appropriate for a 10 year old. My birthday is in the fall, so it was almost a year before I got money to buy batteries on my own (I was laughed out of the room multiple times/years for daring to ask for any kind of allowance, from any relative, in exchange for yard work or my regular chores (plus doing my brothers because he was and is less than useless) and my dad would have set me on fire before he'd even consider allowing me to take *his* shovel/rake to try to do chores for neighbors.)\n\nEvery other gift I got that year and for **every year until I was 19** was either a sweater (which I actually loved as it was the only time any clothing besides underpants was purchased new for me - I love secondhand clothes, even as a kid, but *never* having new anything gets depressing, *especially* as a kid), or 'bathroom sets' - aka a bag/basket with lotion + bath salts/beads + bubble bath. Nice, but not at *all* personal, thought out, or in my case, useful, because my dad would punish me if I was in the only bathroom in our house for more than 20 minutes. Also the bath sets were given by **every relative** during this time, and NOBODY needs 6+ sets every year (all grandparents divorced, I had multiple Christmases each year as no one could stand anyone else).

But yeah, at work, a coworker points out a mistake in a meeting when she could have easily told me privately.

If the person chooses to name themselves, the names are removed when the results are shared publicly amongst the attendees. If anyone is curious, the winner was \"Utility bill (average amount $200) followed by \"Vanilla gift card\" (average amount $100). If you could afford to put $200 into the gift, great. But it wasn't required and no one was upset about pulling the gift card.\n\n----\nQuestionnaire:\n\nBased on your current situation, please include the maximum that you can afford to gift someone without making a sacrifice somewhere else.

Please list bill and average amount. This may include traditional utilities, cell phone, student loan payment, car insurance, etc. If it's a monthly bill, please include it.)\n\n-A \"Vanilla\" gift card to be used anywhere you need\n\n-Your gas tank filled up (Not you \"Rick\".

It was quite manipulative and had nothing to do with being neurodiverse, and some days it feels like people don\u2019t acknowledge that there are people who really just are this transactional and for all they say \u201cI gave back as much as you put in\u201d, at no point are they reaching out to be the first to put in more effort, it\u2019s all about what they get", "I suspect OP has never received a 10/10 gift because cold, dead, shark heart.", "I want to see the list", "She asked for the vacuum tho, and practical gifts (especially the more costly ones like vacuums) are always nice to get. Not only did OP save his mom money but also time. He\u2019s an AH, but not for giving his mom the vacuum.", "They're not as good as you think, not any more.", "Hahahaha I\u2019m autistic too. Don\u2019t pretend like your flavor of autism is everyone\u2019s. That\u2019s pretty conceited.", "He sees the gifts he intentionally makes less/worse to equal as what the other person- who probably did what they thought was best- as equal. \n\n\nIn his mind he is like \"I could give my girlfriend a 10/10 present, because I have this great idea, but I only got a 5 from her so she gets a gift card\". \n\n\nWhile his gf might have thought (and was never corrected) that she gave him a good gift and wonders why at their second year she now gets generic gifts. \n\n\nI disagree that this would never had lead to problems.", "Exactly. I would prefer a gift card than something I don\u2019t use. \n\nHonestly I bought 2 of my own presents this year and gave them wrapped to my mum and niece to give to me!\n\nWay less wasteful!", "I think he has a good system and that it is thoughtful. he said in a comment that he over-gifted a lot before - meaning he would give overly thoughtful or too much of a gift and he felt bad bc the people told him they felt like they were under gifting and so didn't want to do gift exchanges. \n\nto combat this he has a system to match the level of the gifts to make sure people don't feel bad or feel pressure. I honestly think it's a good system.\n\nI'm autistic myself and often will write out little systems for tracking things neurotypical people seem to be able to sense naturally .\n\nanyway, NTA - but I am not surprised that everyone thinks he is TA since he's weird. /shrug", "Mine as well. Maybe his reactions aren't \"right\", especially to NTs, but it is typical. More explanation than excuse. \n\nI'm not sure why people think that all explanations are meant to be an excuse??", "Right!!!", "Me too. I quite liked it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an AH thing do.", "My daughter is autistic. She is very concerned about fairness and things being equal. That is what made me think OP might have autism. I think my daughter would love this system!  I think it is a great idea. NTA", "Awesome user name!", "The insinuation that he must be autistic to behave this way is offensive.", "The insinuation that autism would be an excuse for this behavior from someone who is clearly a functional adult is deeply offensive because it\u2019s incredibly infantalizing. People with autism often (but not always) have difficulty interpreting or understanding neurotypical social cues and expectations, leading to hurtful misunderstandings, but those of us who care about not hurting people \u2014 and don\u2019t feel entitled to never consider anyone else just because we\u2019re different \u2014 tend to put some effort into figuring out the basics, especially by adulthood. And this isn\u2019t some arcane subtlety, it\u2019s literally about rating people. And OP is a functional adult. \n\nHand waving this away as \u201coh he\u2019s probably autistic\u201d is deeply offensive to those of us with autism who aren\u2019t assholes.", "as a fellow autistic person, normally id agree wholeheartedly, but in this instance i think its a perfectly valid question. after reading OPs comments, heres what i picked up:\n\n\u2022 hes had this system for over 13 years, so since he was at least ten years old, and he said the system was due to him feeling like the holidays were unfair, so its safe to assume he\u2019s had this perspective for most of his life, even before the age of 10\n\n\u2022 he views this as the best way to keep christmas fair, because he views over/under gifting as creating debt\n\n\u2022 he views this as the best way to express his emotions during gift giving, and doesn\u2019t think its cold or disingenuous because its the only system that makes sense to him\n\n\u2022 he genuinely doesnt understand why his girlfriend is upset, because he thinks this system is the only way to be fair and to prevent discomfort for all parties\n\n\u2022 he genuinely thinks everyone views gift giving like this\n\nhonestly the way OP talks about it, im still not convinced he *isnt* on the spectrum. \n\n> Gift giving is a transaction, which makes it obligatory. My goal is to prevent being in debt or having someone in debt to me\n\n> Ive kept this system in some form or another for over 13 years now [\u2026] The goal is for me to give people similar gifts to that which i received, so that no one\u2019s uncomfortable about over or under giving. \n\n> I am expressing my own emotion, just in the appropriate amount as specified by what I received from them\n\n> I think a lot of people have a similar system in their head. I just write mine down as it allows me to be more detail oriented\n\nlike, it is totally valid to ask if someone is on the spectrum in a situation like this, where its pretty clear that theres no malice, he just genuinely doesn\u2019t understand how his system is wrong. i also had a similar system until i was about 17, where id gift people presents based on how thoughtful the gifts i received were, until someone told me that was weird and i stopped. \n\nnow, and heres the important part, **being autistic would explain the system, but it wouldnt excuse his disregard for his girlfriend\u2019s feelings, and id still call him the asshole for being so dismissive**. it could totally explain why he views the holidays like this, but it would not give him a free pass to brush off his girlfriend\u2019s emotions.", "Amen. People acting like this is why Kanye West is saying he \u201cmight be a little autistic\u201d as if that somehow excuses his behavior", "The rating (if done privately) isn\u2019t that bad but I think it\u2019s douchey to let it affect the gifts you give other people. (Also autistic)", "It's absolutely an AH thing to do - do not do this.\n\nFirst, the OP is claiming that he's thoughtful and other people lack consideration, but that is subjective, not quantifiable. People frequently put a lot of thought and effort into gifts that the receiver just doesn't like. The OP is taking his subjective opinion and essentially assigning an arbitrary moral judgment to it. That is an incredibly self-centered way of looking at relationships and giving. Like, he gave himself a 5 for the vacuum cleaner gift; what if his mom gave it a 1 because he gave it to be vindictive not because he cared?\n\nHe is being very petty and honestly malicious in this. It's not about being fair to him, it's about being punitive.", "Thanks, can't wait for the next season!", "I think they wondered if he is on the spectrum due to the nature of the scoring system (and the detailed way it works)\u2026 not because of his \u201cbehaviour\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a very valid question when you consider those on the spectrum do often quantify things in this manner.", "Absolutely fair and maybe I'm not understanding this correctly. \n\nUnderstanding what's ok socially is something that an autistic person could struggle with from what i understand, that would no way mean that every autistic person is like this. Just that it could be a reason for the behavior. \n\nAsking the question could affect the verdict: slight AH or huge AH\n\nIt's the difference between having to explain the problem to someone because it's something they struggle with or If they are not autistic then they should understand how others would perceive the scoring and doing it anyway, which would make them a huge AH.", "the question, to me, is more 'are you on the spectrum. if you are this is not thoughtful or socially acceptable. If you're not you're just a dick'", "I'm sorry that you find it offensive. My 5 year old is autistic with social difficulties and I can see how she's already struggling with her peers and is trying to keep up and understand, but often she just doesn't understand.  Her brain works differently to others. I won't say differently to mine because I'm beginning to suspect I am also autistic.  Old memories are coming back from my child hood and...I just empathise a lot with anyone who struggles socially. \n\nAlso, autism is a spectrum, and it's called that for a reason. It varies from person to person. \n\nI honestly believe OP is trying to understand the rules of gift giving and has created this system to make sure its fair. It probably helps lower his anxiety too.", "Autism isn't all sunshine and rainbows, it def sticks out to me as autistic bc of his \"sense of justice and fairness\" and a meticulous point system", "I'm autistic and I don't find it offensive either", "They didn't say he must be, they asked if he was.", "It was not because the behaviour was offensive, it is because the nature of the offensive behaviour is in line with stereotypical autistic behaviour. -Another person with autism who felt this was autistic behaviour.", "As an autistic person, OP makes more sense to me than anything.\n\nI have a very hard time understanding why when I give cash as a gift, people get upset. I have had to devise systems like OPs with \u201crules\u201d that I\u2019ve derived from normies to understand how to give gifts at any gift giving occasion that would be appropriate.\n\nI don\u2019t find it offensive at all that someone asked this question.
