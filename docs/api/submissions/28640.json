Keep checking until clothes are really dry. Then fold, iron, hang clothes (and don't forget all the bits that go along with ironing!). Then take the clothes to the bedroom and put in wardrobes in the correct places. Repeat. At least 2 loads a week, one on Friday so your work clothes are done by Monday. Plus a mental check everyday in case there's enough for an extra load. Plus sheets and towels once a month. And handwashing. And any special cases like swim or sports clothes. Plus you never leave the laundry without wiping down for dust and drips of water, putting chemicals away from your kids reach, checking levels and then going to kitchen to write stuff on the shopping list.

He's used to everything disappearing a d being cleaned. He can do his own laundry.", "NTA. he should get over himself", "You need to leave him. Not the mess.", "You are raising two children. NTA", "You are in fact *NOT* the a\\*\\*hole", "NTA\n\nThough I hope you made the point as that was the perfect opportunity.\n\nAlso, plan a day out with friends. Leave him with the kid again all day.", "So my hubby and I both work outside the home full time jobs.  I usually do most household chores.  We were searching for a new home to buy and I commented how much I loved a few laundry rooms of home we looked at. Twice hubby said why does it matter I do ask the laundry.  (I got sick and for about a week hubby had to do laundry). I didn't a word but the second time he said that in front of our realtor I stopped doing his laundry.  Took him 3 months to realize he was having to do his laundry.  (I still did mine and our child). Was freaking hilarious when it finally clicked with him because he had a huge basket of unfolded laundry I told him he needed to fold.  \ud83e\udd23", "NTA he needs to man up and quit being a child", "NTA.", "This behavior won\u2019t stop\u2026it will be an ongoing issue", "NTA. Your first reaction should\u2019ve been to get your partner a mirror. It also doesn\u2019t sound like you pointed out what he went through was for one day was what you were going through day in and day out unnoticed on his part so missed opportunity there.", "NTA, If it's so easy, he should have been able to handle it without a problem.", "NTA - I think it was a great idea to stop doing everything UNTIL he naturally comes to the realization that what you do is hardwork. Don't settle for a half-ass apology. He has to REALLY see. Keep it up.\n\nFYI: Research says men create seven EXTRA hours of work per week for their spouses. Fuck that!\n\n(I an doing something similar with my husband.)", "NTA.\n\nBut that he has refused to acknowledge your work load (despite struggling with taking on a fraction of it) indicates he\u2019s unwilling to recognise you, and this will be an ongoing point of contention and possibly end your relationship.", "\"Oh that's nothing. I do that everyday.\" NTA", "no. but Y-TA for staying with him. he only adds problems and does solve nothing. you get the same as single mom with childsupport AND on top of that you wont have his mess to clean up. sorry to say that, but a good catch is something else. this must have been happening even before you were pregnant. he is a walking red flag.", "NTA - You should leave the mess that IS him.  He is too prideful to admit you are right.  Do you want another 20+ years of this disrespect and more kids to compound the burden and multiply his insults? \n\nOUIJA board says \"exit\" is in your future.  You decide if it's now or later.", "NTA- if you have a partner picking up after you and making sure you have a nice home and a happy child you buy them flowers and take them on a nice date.. you don't do this.", "NTA\n\nYou used to clean your mess, his mess and your toddlers mess. All he had to do that one day was clean his mess so he didn't do as much work as you usually do", "NTA you're his significant other, not his mom or maid", "NTA. He sounds like a walking red flag. I did this once to my partner and he soon realized just how much I do around the house and how it quite quickly falls apart if I stop. He now cleans up after himself and the kids as needed.", "no you should be honest and ik you may love him but if my partner treated me like this and complain abt everything while saying that your lazing around i don't think i would stay w him if it keeps goin like this js switc places for a day and actually get his attention and if gets worse js get to a relationship therapy thing idk what it i called  sry and i hope you will get out of the situation", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s tough looking after 2 kids.", "def not the a-hole it's a smart idea and he should be able to take care of his mess and his daughter for atleast a day otherwise you'll nvr be able to go out", "NTA. Though you should communicate directly rather than just by not doing stuff.", "This reminds me of the one time I pulled a similar stunt for hubby.  I left him for half a day to take care of our 1 year old.  By the time I got back - the house was trashed and he had a very haunted look in his eye.  Didn't say a word.  He had experienced my normal day.", "That's horrible. Not only did he not step up to help out, he passed off his responsibilities to his mother. I'm guessing he didn't take on more responsibility after she left either.", "I love how he burned you without even trying by proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that your constant cleaning had no value to someone who didn't share your unhealthy obsession with cleanliness, and yet you both managed not to admit that to yourself and to convince yourself you \"won\".  I doubt most mental patients have that level of skill in denial.  You are truly special.", "I was 19, making him 24. There's 5.5 years between us", "He was amazing at the start, when I worked full time, he  wouldn't let me do much at all. Daughter was a surprise but even when I was pregnant and early pp he was still great with seeing the chores and either appreciated what I did or did it himself. Its only since she \"doesn't need as much attention\" that he's been a dick about chores", "Because she was a surprise, we're engaged, but weddings are expensive, and honestly, I'd rather have the money for our daughter or in savings in case something in the house goes wrong. Also, we prioritised buying a house to having an extravagant party", "He was excellent at the start. When I worked full time (doing slightly more hours than him) he barely let me do anything around the house", "I love this so much!", "Think long term. If you don't have academic, technical qualifications, then get it, and get out of this relationship.\n\nYWBTA if you let you daughter learn that men can behave like this. I'm perfectly fine with women being SAHM but they deserve equal respect bc it's a full time job.", "So you are a single mom with two toddlers.", "Maybe you need to remind him that your  work day does not stop at 5 oclock,  You don't get weekends off or sick days.", "Have you told him that you're not going to pick up after him anymore? \n\nYou should not have to pick up after him. But if you've been doing so and then just stopped, with no communication that you were doing so, then you're also being an ass.", "Oh, OP.  There is a massive difference between cleaning up and cleaning up after someone.  You don't have to do the latter.  \ud83d\udc99", "you aren't his mommy. the man is almost 30, he needs to be a big boy and learn how to clean up after himself. my 5 yo nephew does better than my own husband.", "Look him straight in the eye and say \u201cI\u2019m not your maid,  clean up your own shit\u201d. See what he says.", "reminds me of me mum cleaning up after me. Is he also a 14 year old?", "You know, even though your daughter\u2019s only a year and a half, you can teach her not to go around \u201cundoing what you\u2019ve done\u201d. That will probably help you so you don\u2019t have to redo what you\u2019ve already done. It\u2019s not going to be so funny or cute (or whatever the reason you allow that) at 3.", "If she left he'd only bitch about how much child support he pays and how he works his ass off so she can live the high life off his child support money. \nFuck off Greg your $330 a month don't make a dent in:\n\n-The extra rent needed to pay for a place big enough so your 9yr old doesn't have to share your bedroom\n- Power / water / internet\n- Food\n- Clothes\n- Toiletries \n- Doctors\n- Dentists\n- School items\n- Childcare costs\n- Opticians\n- Petrol \n- Extra curriculars", "But before you leave, make sure everything is put away and spotless and ask him, \"Is this up to your standards? Make sure you check everything, I don't want to leave anything for you to do.\" And video everything, maybe like an apartment inspection. Then when you come back to a disaster he can't say that's how you left it.", "Helping yes, but doing all of it? Nah", "> I'm going to ask that we attend counselling, so hopefully, it won't come to that\n\nBe careful with that.  I highly recommend that you read the book [https://archive.org/details/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat](https://archive.org/details/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat) before going to counseling with him.  If has an abusive personality, counseling will likely make him worse.", "It's the impact it has on your daughter. But it's also the impact on you and the relationship he has with you. Good luck. Another commenter has left a book recommendation. Pls check it out.", "So, basically he never owns his behavior. When he's caught, he'll never admit it. Not super mature. \n\nBeware of people who refuse to apologize or own their shit.", "Did he go straight from his mom's house to yours?", "What 18 month old doesn\u2019t need freaking attention?!\n\nMy husband and I every Sunday night after our daughter has run rampage through the house on Saturday and Sunday clean up.\n\nSure we can do things like putting the laundry on and managing the dishes while she\u2019s about, but if I tried to sweep or mop? Erm no. We\u2019ve tried, and she fights us for the broom, and ends up hurting herself/us, so we give up, then she uses the broom to knock her toys over and make more GD mess.\n\nToddlers, unlike babies, are also capable of chasing you and actively creating mess as opposed to just being there and the only mess being things like bottles and spit up.", "Please really think about this situation before you elope, do you really want this man and life to be the same forever? Do you actually think he's capable of changing? Will he be a good male role model to your daughter on what to expect from a man and equal partner?", "Oh please do not marry this bum.\n\n[https://archive.org/details/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat](https://archive.org/details/LundyWhyDoesHeDoThat)\n\nYou need this book ASAP.", "Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s pig pen anyone? Dispose of enemies and horrible ex\u2019s", "THIS! All the thises, he doesn't appreciate it and OP shouldn't be doing it so I'd stop.\n\nNTA OP, if anything this was natural consequence of his attitude and life. Either he'll appreciate it or you just keep not picking up after him. If need be leave his mess on his favorite chair so he can clean it before he relaxes.", " This also leads to stuff like the man having no idea how to cope( with household stuff) should something happen to the wife.", "I'm quite fortunate that if needed, both of my parents are high up in their companies and would take me on to work with them in a heartbeat and allow me to live with them if it came to it. I do have quite a few qualifications that make me very employable", "I have asked that he pick up after himself, but he insists that he works too much to make mess", "And you sound as immature as he is \ud83d\ude1e", "She's not doing it to be naughty or anything, she just likes to copy me so she'll get things out so she can put them away, she just doesn't understand her limits of what she's actually capable of", "Fair Play is awesome! Highly recommend it also! Laura Danger has an excellent Instagram account to follow featuring Fair Play material. She's @thatdarnchat", "I agree it\u2019s not the asshole and he should be helping, however unpaid labour is a negative context is almost always used to imply slavery", "Yes OP this book is amazing. Read it.", "Yeah, the area that we live it's neigh on impossible to live independently (most people have roommates until they are married). He went straight from mums to our house", "Your daughter sounds exactly like mine, she really wants to help but her \"helping just makes more mess \ud83d\ude05", "If you\u2019re going to troll, at least put some real effort in, lol.  This is just pathetic.", "Same with me. Husband doesn\u2019t necessarily pick up in general, but he does pick up after himself.", " Exactly. My husband understands that I am not the maid, so he helps with all of the household chores.", "Generally man-childs like this don't agree to counseling, or if they do, they don't actually participate.\n\nIf you do not have a safe way out, start looking into that before you tell him the relationship is over.  Even if it is just taking an extra $20 out whenever you get groceries and sticking it in a bank account he doesn't know about.  If he got this upset about having to clean up his own mess, imagine how upset he will get if you try to leave and take your child with you.  Call some women's transitional houses (maybe from a friend's phone if he as access to your phone or records), and they can help you get a safe exit plan in place.  Hopefully you won't need it, but it is always better to have it and not need it than to not have it and need it.", "Ironically, you may find you have a cleaner house if you do split up.", "How? Because I think the relationship is toxic? That's a hell of a leap.", "You're the only one who thinks so. \n\nMaybe think about that for a minute.", "That is a recipe for disaster.

Which means slim pickin's if you're not willing to put in any effort.  The good ones catch on quickly", "If she decides THAT dude who can't even do less than the bare minimum is what she and her child \"worth\" then she needs therapy. \n\nOP is still young to stay stuck with such a partner.
