This feels like an issue with a lot of grey areas and the situation escalated quickly so I wanted to ask here for some unbiased opinion if I\u2019m the asshole here.\n\nTL;DR: Brother passed away. Me & Dad wanted to keep the dog. Mom gave away the dog to brother\u2019s roommate. I yelled and got angry at my mom for that. \n\nMy (33M) brother Niko (25M) passed away 4 months ago.\n\nFor context: Niko moved from our house when he was 18. He was working a 9 to 5, and he was doing fine by himself. We weren\u2019t particularly close but I knew that he was living with a roommate, Adam (25M probably), for around 3 years, and doing good on his own. He\u2019d visit us for holidays, call us for b-days. He adopted a puppy 2 years ago, Udon. From that day, he would visit us with Udon, send us pics and stuff.\n\nAfter Niko passed away, and after the funeral, our dad was the one that recovered Niko\u2019s belongings. He talked to Niko\u2019s roomie and recovered Niko\u2019s smartphone and his laptop even though they were formatted, some clothes, books, etc. His roommate, Adam, sent us the rest of his stuff later. Adam was also there for his funeral service even though he was helpful, he was clearly very affected by his death. \n\nThe only thing that was up in the air was Niko\u2019s dog, Udon. My dad called Adam and asked him about the dog. Adam said Udon was fine, and that he was hoping to keep Udon with him. My dad was furious. Right after, Adam texted me and told me he was very close to Udon and he really wanted to keep taking care of him. I said it was \u2018a difficult situation for the family\u2019.  My dad was seeing red, and went directly to Niko\u2019s place later that week. He used Niko\u2019s spare key and took the dog while Adam wasn\u2019t there. My dad is a lawyer so he\u2019s 100% sure he was on the right side of the law in this situation. Niko didn\u2019t leave a will or testament, or any note for that matter, but my dad said the dog belongs 100% to us, as we\u2019re next of kin. \n\nAdam called me while I was working, later that day, asking for Udon. I said I stood by my dad\u2019s decision, it was hard because he was sobbing, but you know, family comes first. He hung up on me. My mom told me Adam called her too that day but she was too anxious to speak with him at that moment. After that, my dad asked Adam to stop contacting us or he would take legal actions. \n\nMy mom was not happy with how things went down and she said she was losing sleep over it. A few days ago she told me and my dad that she gave away the dog to Adam and that it was her final decision and we should end this situation. She told us Adam promised to send pics and allow us to visit. My dad and I were furious, honestly. My dad left for a walk but I was so angry that I yelled at her and probably said some harsh stuff as 'traitor'  that I regretted quickly. I apologised but I was still mad at her decision. I\u2019m still mad to be honest.", "created_utc": 1676578100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113zqxk/aita_for_yelling_and_calling_my_mom_a_traitor/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to think about what is best for the dog not what you want. \n\nAlso side note there is a very high chance Adam was more than just a roommate.", "YTA\n\nAdam lived with that dog basically every day, you didn\u2019t . That dog was more his than yours, regardless of the fact that he belonged to your brother. You removed a dog unnecessarily from a loving home and caretaker that it already knew and loved in return. Udon already lost his one human, and you took him away from his second.\n\nI get you\u2019re upset, but what your dad did was a huge AH move (and I hope Adam changed his locks). You calling your mom names because she was the only one of you willing to do the right thing is atrocious. You owe your mom and Adam apologies.\n\nAs far as Adam sending you pictures and letting you visit\u2026he\u2019s a bigger person than you and your dad considering you broke into his apartment (key or not, his son\u2019s stuff was no longer there and he no longer had a reason to be in there other than maliciousness), stole his dog, and then threatened him that if he didn\u2019t leave you all alone he\u2019d sue. So he\u2019s a hell of a lot nicer than you two.", "YTA. Yr dad is an AH too.\n\nI don't quite understand why this escalated. You say your father was \"furious\" that Adam wanted to keep the dog. Why? It doesn't sound like your family had much relationship with the animal.\n\nAnd there was surely a better way to resolve this than your father breaking into your brother's home and taking the dog.\n\nIf he's convinced he has the legal right to do so, that should've been demonstrated through the proper channels. Such as having a lawyer present a letter to Adam stating that as the dog was Niko's property, the next of kin has the right to the dog. That would've established the grounds for getting the dog.\n\nThere are some other possibilities. Perhaps the two considered it \"their\" dog and Adam contributed financially to his upkeep; perhaps that would establish Adam also had claim to the dog.\n\nBut in any case, it was wrong of your father to act so preemptively. And I don't see how your mother is a \"traitor.\" \n\nFrankly, I would let Adam keep the dog, and leave them both alone. If you must, pursue a claim legally, don't break into Adam's home again.", "YTA- yet no one but your mom thought of how the dog felt.  Udon lived with Adam and your bro his whole life.   That is who HIS family was and only visited you guys.\n\nIt makes total sense to me that Adam keeps Udon as that is who now has the closest bond to the dog.", "YTA. Stealing the dog from its home where it seemed to have someone it was used to caring for it.", "YTA - You all have each other and all Adam has left of your brother is the dog.   Just so you know this type of stuff is the reason why people hate lawyers.   \n\nWe're sorry for your loss but stealing someone else's pet because your \"legally\" allow is a real asshole move bro", "You only briefly see this dog a couple times a year. The dog will have bonded with the roommate.\n\nIt is kinder for the dog to be left with a person it loves in a place it knows than to be moved to another place out of principle. Principle won't give this dog a better life. Let it go.", "YTA you are cruel people. As for your computer and phone comment, why was that important to include?\nHave you ever considered hey were more than roommates?", "Sorry, but soft YTA. I think the dog should stay with Adam. He is probably most comfortable there, the dog is most likely grieving and confused, too. Niko would probably want what is best for his dog.", "Yta. And also your dad broke into Adam\u2019s house. What he did wasn\u2019t legal\u2014so I really wouldn\u2019t trust what your dad (who sounds like he has rage blackouts) says. This is overall a very sad situation and I\u2019m sorry.", "Your dad trespassed and took a dog that he may not even have a legal right to. If your Father is a lawyer he's a real shitty one.\n\nYTA, so is your Dad.", "You and your dad need to grow tf up and stop bxing abt a dog that hall probably had no relationship with and want because it\u2019s \u201cFamily\u201d", "YTA (and your dad).

Adam should have the dog. \n\nYour mum did the right thing", "YTA, or a least your father is,  your father had  absolutely no right to enter a property he neither owns of leases without the owner or lease's permission and take anything. If he wanted the dog he could have made arrangements to pick the dog up.", "YTA\n\nAdam and the dog already had a bond. They lived together. Your mom absolutely did the right thing. Taking the dog how your dad did may have been legally ok, but it totally sucked. You backing him up also sucks. I\u2019m just glad your mom has a conscience.", "YTA\n\nSo not only has the dog lost his owner, you want to take him away from the home and other person he's known for his entire life? \n\nAs you said, you weren't even close to your brother. You have no idea how close him and his \"roommate\" were.", "I know you said elsewhere this couldn't be true, but everything you say about how Niko and Adam lived, and how Adam has been since your brother's death, would make more sense if your brother was gay. It seems as if they were in a relationship and shared a pet. And perhaps your mother knew or at least suspected that was the case.", "YTA\n\nYour brother\u2019s roommate had a much closer relationship to him and the dog, he has way more entitlement to the dog.\n\nAlso, your dad is a shitty lawyer.\n\nNot on the lease means NO entering without explicit permission, which he did not have, does NOT matter he had a key.\n\nYour mom is an angel and you owe her such an apology, Adam too.", "YTA, you saw that dog a couple of times on holidays, while Afam was there since it was a pup. What you did is crazy and never in this post did I see that you cared about the dog, you just wanted to have it... But for what? If you don't have any love for a pet - give it to someone who has.", "Giving a soft YTA and seek grief therapy. I dont think you were spiteful but I do think your rationale is clouded by your emotions. Family is important, yes, but Adam was likely like family in your brother's eyes too. Also, consider his perspective and the dog's emotional stability. The dog has been living with Adam for a few years already and sees him as part of \"the pack\" more than your family. Udon is should be most comfortable in a situation that is also distressing and traumatizing (dogs know when a person is no longer there).\n\nThat said, your dad trespassed on Adam's property (even if leased, it's contractual) which is certainly illegal regardless of whether the dog even willed to you guys. Even as far as taking a pet away from a co-owner in the household that has familiarity with the dog akin to a family unit, it can still be a legal grey area, but I think the fact your dad broke into the home uninvited does not help his case.\n\nI hope you and your dad are able to grieve in a healthier manner and recover from your cloud of anger. Maybe listen to your mom's perspective as well. She may even sense that the reasons for taking the dog isn't entirely a rational or healthy action.", "YTA\n\n\\*Why\\* can't Adam keep Udon? Udon already has a good bond with Adam and he is already in a loving environment.\n\nYou and your family never took care of Udon in the first place and now you want to remove him.", "Yta - he and the dog were together longer than many marriages. You got everything else\u2026 I get it but your mom was right. But skip all of that - your brother would want what is best for his dog which is not an unnecessary rehoming.\nEdited : dogs don\u2019t get rehired - spelling", "YTA-  sneaking into some ones home is shitty. Your mom did the right thing.", "YTA\n\nThe dog is home with Adam. That is where the dog lived. Your dad's house was where Nico *visited with his dog*. Neither you or dad are entitled to Adam's dog.", "YTA. I was gonna be on the soft side but your entitlement and lack of compassion changed that. Your Dad literally let himself into Adam's home and stole ADAMs dog. They've lived together for over 2 years. Adam is literally sobbing over losing Udon. Leave the dog there. \n\nLosing people is hard and grief can be unbearable but it doesn't justify the way your treating Adam. He is also grieving.", "YTA, and your dad is too. I'm not going to go with \"soft\" either. Hard as fuck. You had no right to speak to your mother like that when she was brave enough to step up and do the right thing in the face of your, and your father's, petty malice toward somebody who is grieving. You did not, even one time, give any hint in your post that you care at all about Udon. You seem to only care about punishing Adam, and I think the way you responded to the suggestion about them possibly being more than friends says a lot about why. Not many people sob and grieve like that over a roommate. Adam at the very least lost an incredibly close friend to be in that state, and your reaction was to kick salt in the wound because you think you \"deserve\" to take Udon out of the loving home he's known his whole life. That's not just YTA territory, it's disgusting, bro. You and your father need to reflect on why you feel like this, and what you actually are trying to accomplish by taking the dog. It's certainly not because you care about Udon, or about what your brother would have wanted.", "YTA.\n\nAnd your dad is a fool; that wasn't Niko's place anymore, it was solely Adam's. It doesn't matter if he had a spare key to get in, he entered the apartment without the tenants knowledge or permission. *That is illegal.*\n\nIt's probably easier to side with your ass of a father, saves you a lot of pain, but your mom was right and you were aggressive and rude.", "\n>He used Niko\u2019s spare key and took the dog while Adam wasn\u2019t there. My dad is a lawyer so he\u2019s 100% sure he was on the right side of the law in this situation.

You never took care of the dog, his roommate was around it daily for it's whole life. \nThank God for you mom. Otherwise it's just a bunch of irrational dicks that don't care about the dog.", "YTA. It\u2019s probably a very painful situation for your family but stealing a dog? Sounds like Adam was even willing to share the dog, you could\u2019ve worked something out.", "YTA--think less about what you \"inherited,\" and think more about Udon. Dogs like staying places they know, with people they are familiar with. I understand that, right now, Udon feels like a piece of your brother's life, and you guys are in a whole lot of pain. But keeping Udon will not ameliorate your grief. Your brother presumably loved this dog and would want Udon to be well cared for, and as Adam has already been caring for him, he is the right person to keep Udon in the future. Your mom probably should have tried harder to reason with you guys, but it seems clear that she made the decision because of her concern for the dog's welfare, and also showing compassion to Adam, who cared about your brother too and was about to lose a pet as well as a friend. When your grief isn't so overwhelming, you may well come to agree with this decision.", "YTA\n\nFor the reasons said. I think you need to grieve now and reflect on this later. \n\n\"Next of kin\", sure, but you never cared for the dog. They did. The \"roommate\" is obviously devastated and I wouldn't be surprised to know he was more than a roommate.\n\nYou can be on the right side of the law and morally wrong.", "YTA there\u2019s clearly a lot about the relationships here that OP is omitting.", "There are zero gray areas here. YTA in every conceivable way, as everyone has said. I'd like to also add that you still haven't hit on the actual reason for being the AH, and seem to just be thinking \"well maybe I shouldn't have yelled at my mom\". I sincerely hope you read some of these comments and take them to heart, because it will take an enormous mental shift to go from \"my dad is 100% in the right for breaking into someone's home\" to anything resembling reality.", "\"My dad is a lawyer\" lol, lmao even. \n\nUnless your dad's name is on the lease then it was an unlawful entry because Adam did not want you there and didn't invite you. Your dad leveraging the \"I'm a lawyer\" card just means he's comfortable being a bully to your late brother's friend. \n\nTBH, I think your brother would be ashamed of you and your father. He only had a perfunctory relationship with you people and you're going out of your way to hurt someone he lived with and cared for across 3 years and up until his death! Because faaaaamily. That dog and his roommate were probably as good as family to him, maybe even better than you have been to him, and you never had a relationship with that dog so you have no right to it. You don't even care you're completing upending his life and taking him from one of the 2 caretakers he's had his whole life.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss and I know you're grieving but so is Adam and you are NOT entitled to your brother's things based on him being your brother. Your mom absolutely did the right thing.", "YTA but very soft because all of you are going through an impossible situation. It sounds like Adam is very attached to the dog and, while I really can't tell, it sounds like you and your dad are more sore about who should \"legally\" get him and how \"awful\" it is that Adam might want the dog he lives with and probably helped take care of ... rather than caring about the dog itself or even Adam, who I assume is probably much closer to the dog than you are. It sounds like this is just misdirected anger after you all losing someone so important to you, which I know is so hard, but you need to step back a bit. \n\nI understand wanting the dog, but it's not like you all were living with or caring for the dog, so materially nothing at all changes. The dog is still out there and you can visit and see him, but the dog stays where he was.", "YTA\n\nYou and your dad are letting your grief control you right now. Both of you are thinking about what you want, not what's best for Udon. He's lived with Niko AND Adam most of his life. Niko being gone is already confusing enough. But now you want to tear him away from the only other human he's consistently lived with? Your mom had the right idea.", "YTA this is shitty for all involved, but the dog lived with Adam and that's his family. It's better for the dog to stay with the person it's lived with for years.", "YTA. You showed zero indication that you care about the dog in this post, just your entitlement b/c he was your brother. Which is upsetting in itself.\n\nAdditionally, he only owned the pet only about 2-3 years before his death... the time you didn't even bother contacting him. Adam was the primary caretaker after your brother. NOT you. Especially since you admit you weren't close.\n\nNext of kin my ass. If you truly cared about your brother, you'd leave his dog (or THEIR, it's not like you paid for this dog's vet bills, shots, food) to his loving owner. You are incredibly entitled. And I'm not sure what leg you can stand on legally, but morally you're in the wrong. \n\nDid you ever think the dog wouldn't be traumatized just ripping away from his longer time own b/c \"mUh NeXt oF KiN\". Leave him alone. You weren't close to your brother to be making such demands, and focus on your grieving instead of lashing out at others who did nothing to you.

Your title is misleading and demonizes her, I was about to say NTA til I read the appalling OP.\n\nUnless you paid this dog's bills, it is NOT yours and you are harassing this man. There is no contract either from your brother saying Adam has to hand him over. If he really wanted to, he'd draft it a long time ago tho some info would be nice (was it an accident or did he know his time would run out). And if family came first he would've told you. Or indicated. But he didn't, did he? \n\nI wouldn't want a pet around someone who loses their temper either. I feel bad for your mother.

This feels like an issue with a lot of grey areas and the situation escalated quickly so I wanted to ask here for some unbiased opinion if I\u2019m the asshole here.\n\nTL;DR: Brother passed away. Me & Dad wanted to keep the dog. Mom gave away the dog to brother\u2019s roommate. I yelled and got angry at my mom for that. \n\nMy (33M) brother Niko (25M) passed away 4 months ago.\n\nFor context: Niko moved from our house when he was 18. He was working a 9 to 5, and he was doing fine by himself. We weren\u2019t particularly close but I knew that he was living with a roommate, Adam (25M probably), for around 3 years, and doing good on his own. He\u2019d visit us for holidays, call us for b-days. He adopted a puppy 2 years ago, Udon. From that day, he would visit us with Udon, send us pics and stuff.\n\nAfter Niko passed away, and after the funeral, our dad was the one that recovered Niko\u2019s belongings. He talked to Niko\u2019s roomie and recovered Niko\u2019s smartphone and his laptop even though they were formatted, some clothes, books, etc. His roommate, Adam, sent us the rest of his stuff later. Adam was also there for his funeral service even though he was helpful, he was clearly very affected by his death. \n\nThe only thing that was up in the air was Niko\u2019s dog, Udon. My dad called Adam and asked him about the dog. Adam said Udon was fine, and that he was hoping to keep Udon with him. My dad was furious. Right after, Adam texted me and told me he was very close to Udon and he really wanted to keep taking care of him. I said it was \u2018a difficult situation for the family\u2019.  My dad was seeing red, and went directly to Niko\u2019s place later that week. He used Niko\u2019s spare key and took the dog while Adam wasn\u2019t there. My dad is a lawyer so he\u2019s 100% sure he was on the right side of the law in this situation. Niko didn\u2019t leave a will or testament, or any note for that matter, but my dad said the dog belongs 100% to us, as we\u2019re next of kin. \n\nAdam called me while I was working, later that day, asking for Udon. I said I stood by my dad\u2019s decision, it was hard because he was sobbing, but you know, family comes first. He hung up on me. My mom told me Adam called her too that day but she was too anxious to speak with him at that moment. After that, my dad asked Adam to stop contacting us or he would take legal actions. \n\nMy mom was not happy with how things went down and she said she was losing sleep over it. A few days ago she told me and my dad that she gave away the dog to Adam and that it was her final decision and we should end this situation. She told us Adam promised to send pics and allow us to visit. My dad and I were furious, honestly. My dad left for a walk but I was so angry that I yelled at her and probably said some harsh stuff as 'traitor'  that I regretted quickly. I apologised but I was still mad at her decision.

The only decent person in this story is your mother for realizing that you and your father\u2019s actions are extremely elfish", "YTA, and so is your dad. Have either of you thought about what\u2019s best for the dog? Udon is a living being with feelings, not a piece of furniture to be fought over. \n\nWhat your father put that poor dog through is unforgivable and so is your stance on this. Thank God your mother has compassion and thinks of others. \n\nI hope Adam has changed the locks and consulted an attorney. And I hope your father\u2019s clients see this and find someone else to represent them.", "YTA, the dogs owner died, at least leave him in the home he knows with someone he saw daily.", "YTA. Grieving is hard but he's not you or your dad's dog.\n\nYou are not family to that dog. Luckily your mother understands this.", "YTA, Adam lived with Udon. Udon probably loves and trusts Adam nearly as much as your brother. It's traumatic enough for Udon to lose one of his people, to suddenly lose both will be even harder. It's better for the dog to stay with Adam and selfish of you and your father to want to keep it because the law says it belongs to you. You want to keep the dog for you without thinking about the well being of the dog.", "YTA your dad used a spare key and went into someone's home and took the dog when Adam wasn't home isn't that breaking and entering? Secondly you said you weren't close to your brother and you only saw the dog when brother visited so obviously he is closer to Adam the right thing for the dog is to stay with Adam they have already bonded", "YTA its obv to anyone than can read.", "YTA: I really hope your brother can't see how you're acting from wherever he is. He lived with a friend and his dog and made his life there. You treated both like crap because a young man didn't have his will in order. Your mother is kind one with her head on straight in your family and you should take her lead rather than tearing her down. I know grief is hard, but you don't get to treat other beings badly.", "YTA. This is pretty heartless. You already took every material possession of Niko's. The dog's home is with Adam. Don't you understand that Adam is probably as gutted as you are to lose someone he's been living with for three years? And it sounds like it may have been extremely difficult circumstances based on your mention of there not being a note. Adam is the person Udon has left. Please do not take him away from Adam, who obviously loves the dog. And apologize to your mother. It sounds like she has empathy where you and your dad are completely lacking it.", "You are 100% the asshole dude. Jesus. And your dad is just a dick.   How can you treat a dog like that?", "YTA -", "You and your dad don\u2019t give a fuck about what would be best for the dog: THE PERSON HE LIVED WITH FOR NEARLY HIS ENTIRE LIFE.\n\nYTA.", "YTA, everyone else has already driven home the reasons why", "YTA, you're not attached to the dog, you think of dog as property but a dog is not a memento you can remember your brother by. He's a living creature you have to do what's best for him. Your mum did the right thing and honestly you and your dad are pretty monstrous for taking the dog from the also grieving roommate, who you acknowledge was very affected by your brother's death, without even warning the roommate or giving him a chance to say goodbye.", "YTA. Have some compassion.", "YTA \n\nReally just your dad for screaming at someone who your brother was close to, and who is also grieving, before essentially breaking in and stealing the dog. I get he\u2019s in an awful emotional state, but that was *not* an appropriate way to handle things and absolutely the biggest asshole move of this entire situation. \n\nAdam has lived with this dog as long as your brother has. Of course he is incredibly attached. And if the dog is truly your concern, Adam is the only option that allows him to stay in the home he knows, with a caregiver he loves and is deeply familiar with. At a minimum, Adam was happy to have you all visit the dog, and communicate through this whole situation. And that is quite a bit more courtesy than you and your father extended to him.\n\nI think your brother would probably be very sad to see the people he cares about treating each other this way. Maybe you all can extend a little compassion to Adam and behave like adults moving forward if you keep that in mind.", "YTA. Your mom didn't \"give away\" Udon, she returned the dog to his rightful owner. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso LMAO at the \"my dad's a lawyer so he's definitely right\" implication. If Adam paid any money towards the acquisition of the dog, or to care for him, he could at least have a claim to Udon. I'm sorry that you're dealing with the loss of your brother, but his roommate also lost someone here. They shared some amount of their lives together. If they lived together for 3 years then he's not just some dude that your brother knew. And the dog could easily be a FAMILY MEMBER to him.", "YTA. Adam bonded with Udon much more than you or your father.  My former roommate always said if something happened to her I would keep her dog because I was the one other than her than the dog was really comfortable living with. To try to take the dog away from his home and 2nd human is just cruel. I understand you are hurting but it sounds like the dog is where it should be.  Glad your mom had empathy and actually considered the best for the dog.", "YTA. Adam lived with the dog the same amount of time as your brother did and knows the dog much better than you do. It\u2019s best for the dog to remain in his home with the other human he\u2019s known for his entire life than to be uprooted and put with people he doesn\u2019t know as well. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry for the loss of your brother but you aren\u2019t the only people grieving his loss. His roommate and his dog both had a big loss as well and they both have their own feelings about it. Your dad was wrong to sneak in and steal the dog, your mom was right to return him, and you were a jerk for yelling at your mom about it.", "Yta", "Yeah sorry, Udon lived with Adam, not you. It is best for the DOG to be with the other person who helped care for him. You weren\u2019t close to your brother or the dog. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, and I\u2019m sorry for your grief, but your mom actually did the right thing here. Your feelings are not more important than continuity for this poor pup who lost his person.\n\nGently, YTA.", "I am sorry for your loss but YTA. It is best for the dog that the dog stays with what he (Udon) understands to be his home and family. Dogs don't get abstract ideas like extended family. The know the smell, touch and sound of their surroundings and caregivers. If you want a dog to comfort you in your time of grief, get a dog of your own.", "You and your Dad are big AH's and just stop and let the dog and Adam be.  Stop being mean to your Mom for doing the right thing and apologize now.", "Wow... just coming on to the internet to tell everyone y'all stole a dog and then tag-teamed screaming at your mom about it. That's certainly is... a choice.  I shudder to think what this comment section would look like if you weren't also grieving.  YTA.", "You and your dad suck.\n\nMom and Adam are the only decent person here. \n\nGood on mom. Sad she has to live with you assholes, though.\n\nYTA.", "NAH - Grief does terrible things to people and everyone here is grieving.  This is such a hot mess situation.  Sorry for you loss.  If opinions matter to you I think your Mom did the right thing for Udon and Adam.", "YTA.\n\nI get the feeling that your brother and Adam were together. And Udon is their furbaby.\n\nBut even if they were not like that, none of you have bonded with Udon. And Adam has. And wants Udon to stay.\n\nWhy are you putting the dog through more instability?", "This sounds like another post I read from the other perspective and it was her late boyfriends dog and even though she wanted him the parents still got to take the dog because they weren\u2019t married. It turned out to be a really bittersweet situation because it helped her boyfriends family heal. I\u2019m saying NTA but I do think that you guys could\u2019ve went a better route with it because he is probably grieving too.", "NTA\n\nGet your family dog back. Take legal action.", "I suspected this as well.\n\n> our dad was the one that recovered Niko\u2019s belongings. He talked to Niko\u2019s roomie and recovered Niko\u2019s smartphone and his laptop **even though they were formatted**\n\nSounds like Adam was either under instructions to, or made the educated decision to make sure OP's dad never got to see Niko's personal files.", "The dog was adopted after they were living together, so even if they weren't in a secret relationship it was a household pet.  Adams reaction to the dog being taken is all the proof judge Judy would need to determine that, this guy's lawyer dad can touch grass.  YTA op and dad.  Good for your mom, she did the right thing.", "Yes, exactly. Was thinking this, but didn't know how to say it.", "This!", "OP also assumed the brother adopted the dog solo and not they adopted.", "The roommate had to deal with the death of a close friend and then the family coming to steal essentially his dog.", "This. It's hard to be too firm about calling them assholes because they're all going through so much grief right now, which is going to affect your thought process. It just sounds like they want the dog because they think they're owed the dog.", ">I\u2019m sorry for your loss and hope things work out.\n\nThank you \n\n>That\u2019s his home, you\u2019d be removing an animal that doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, for what reason?\n\nWe're his family too", "Totally agree. The dog bonded with him for 3 years. To the dog, you're the family members that are seen during holidays", "Not to mention THREE YEARS and Adam was 'clearly effected' by his friends death. Sounds like they were really close.", "Yeah the inheritance part, probably has the law on his side, the \"enter someone else's home without permission\" part, generally not so much.", "As a lawyer, he knows what he can get away with despite the law. My mother's a lawyer and we are Texans. I was taught that if I ever have to shoot a person, make sure you kill them because the dead can't testify against you. And you are more likely to get off. Lawyers are taught how to bend the law in law school.", "*Also side note there is a very high chance Adam was more than just a roommate.*\n\nI'm glad someone else got there too. That would make this situation even more heartbreaking.", "> You say your father was \"furious\" that Adam wanted to keep the dog.\n\n\"Hoping to\"!  Not assuming, not demanding, just literally *hoping* to keep his own pet, and OP's dad went from 0 to *RAGE*.", "My first thought: moved out right at 18, went low contact, phone and laptop formated and the way Adam treated the dog... Well, we'll never know. But judging by dad's behavior, he may have had reasons to move out...", ">Have you ever considered hey were more than roommates?\n\nMy brother was straight.  Nothing wrong with being gay but my brother was not. That's not up to discussion.", "This was my first thought. Given that they weren\u2019t that close by OP\u2019s admission, it\u2019s a pretty plausible scenario. Maybe OP should ask Mom straight up.\n\nAlso, even if they were just roommates, everything else people are saying about the bond between Udon and Adam is correct. The dog isn\u2019t an asset, and Adam is clearly heartbroken.", "> Your dad might be legally in his rights,\n\nNot to enter another persons property without permission he isn't", ">Sorry for you loss.\n\nThank you", "It's not a family dog, never was anyone's besides Niko and Adams", "Everyone needs a grave buddy to wipe the evidence!", "Thank you for kind of explaining that. I didn\u2019t realize what the big deal was about that word. Sounds like Adam & Nico had a close relationship, regardless if it was romantic or not. I already thought Adam deserved Udon as a member of their little family, and your comment solidifies that.", "I got the impression that Niko's exit from life was planned and self-inflicted and Niko himself tied up loose ends like formatting his phone and laptop.", "And OP had to deal with the loss of his brother. OP'S father is dealing with the loss of his son and is probably desperate for any connection he can have to his dead son, and the only living connection is the dog. Everyone sucks here. There should have been a real conversation, everyone working together instead of this bs back and forth", "That\u2019s not how it works in dog world. Adam and your brother were his family. You\u2019re a person who vaguely smells like Nico. \n\nHe sees Adam as his family. Adam IS his family. Taking him away was cruel.", "How do you figure that? You think that being related to someone makes their pet your family? Even if that were true, wouldn't you want what's best for your \"family\" member? You obviously don't love the dog and you and your father are being petty. Your mom is the only one in your family that cares about doing what is right and she doesn't deserve to be yelled at and scorned by two selfish jerks because of it.", "Get your own dog. Stop trying to remove the dog from the only home it has known for the past two years. The dog is a living, breathing, sentient being who is grieving the loss of one of his people. Do not remove the dog from his home or his other person.", "How exactly are you the dogs family as well when you clearly stated that you barely even saw your brother? Your obviously grieving but you need to think about what's best for the dog.", "You can still think of Udon as family, but the fact is that he never lived with you so he wouldn't be as attached as you are. The dog would be most comfortable where he was already living in a familiar situation, and you and your dad stole him out of a selfish want. You aren't thinking about the dog, you're thinking about yourselves. YTA", "So it\u2019s ok for \u201cfamily\u201d to put a dog or any being through that type of stress? Basically, your brother\u2019s dog, who is grieving the death of his owner, was snatched out of his safe space. That\u2019s ok? Because you\u2019re \u201cfamily?\u201d Your father treated your brother\u2019s very loved dog as if he were a piece of furniture, as just another piece of property. That\u2019s ok with you?", "You never lived with the dog, never spent much time with it. You don't even care about the dog, you just want to take it. You're a cruel AH.", "I understand that, I guess where I\u2019m looking at it from, I\u2019ve got a daughter who\u2019s father isn\u2019t in her life, if I died Technically he\u2019s next of kin. But would that make it ok for him to come take her away from her home and everything she\u2019s ever known? \nDo you guys have a good relationship with Udon? I\u2019m sorry from the story it sounded like you haven\u2019t had much interaction with the dog but if you\u2019ve got a good relationship with the animal that\u2019s a different story.", "How well are you and your das are knowing the dog?", "I was thinking the same thing. And Mom knew, which is why she was so distressed about the whole situation. Dad and brother obviously didn't know. And judging by the quick, \"he's straight and that's all there is to it!\" reaction from OP, they wouldn't have accepted him. And Mom knew that too. But that's just pure internet speculation.", "OP said that thier brother being gay \"isn't up for discussion\"...", "You know what else is more than a roommate? A friend. Your brother and Adam were obviously very close, and here you are treating him like crap.", "YTA \n\nPretty bold statement to make after saying you guys were not particularly close", "Sure, Jan.", "And your father is a thief. That's not up for discussion either.", "Lol ok bud.  How are you so sure? You seem to be jerks", "I would bet good money your brother would be absolutely appalled and ashamed of how you and your father are treating his friend.", "> make more sense if your brother was gay\n\nAnd as has been commented on above, the phone and laptop were re-formatted, so wiped clean of any photos, messages etc. As if Adam was protecting something in Niko's life", "True, I actually overlooked that.", "even formatted the laptop and phone to get rid of any evidence", "I shared a home with him for 18 years. He was my brother. \n\nAnd I can tell you Niko was a handsome guy, he got all the good genes, had plenty of girlfriends when he was a teen. \n\nAs far as I know, gay men date men, not women. IIRC.\nThat's why I'm sure about it.", "I totally glossed over that!  does make hyou wonder what Adam was hiding about Niko to protect him from his family.  \n\nHmmm, another thought, Niko sounds very greek, family is probably Greek Orthodox which could be telling", "I don't appreciate this comments. Have some respect. Seriously. \n\nI mentioned that just because we weren't sure those were his or Niko\u2019s devices. There wasn't no way to tell if that was Niko\u2019s smartphone or laptop.  \n\nFormatted devices can belong to anyone, you know. But Adam told us they were Niko\u2019s, so we trusted him.  It was an example of how we trusted him and the communication was great BEFORE the issue with the dog.\n\nYou can call me an AH but I truly don't appreciate any of this \"more than roommates\" stuff and it's disrespectful to my brother's memory.  Have some respect please, have some respect.", "You didn't share a home with the dog, though. You and your family are selfish, vain people.", "Lol, you know Bi people exist, right?\n\nNot saying your brother wasn't straight, but plenty of families were totally in the dark before their family member decided to come out. Your assumptions may be more educated than ours, but they are still assumptions.\n\nAnd regardless of weather or not your brother and Adam's relationship was anything beyond friends, they were friends.\n\nHow would your brother react to you treating his friend this way? You think he would be proud?", "If you wanted to write a story to give the impression that they were in a relationship without actually stating it, it would probably read a lot like this.  Specifically pointing out how emotional Adam was about the whole thing is the biggest part to me, almost like it is working to that reveal."]}
