It's not just the stepping over the side of the tub to get in and out - a grab bar mounted in the studs immediately to the side of the tub enclosure help. But I see many people saying to install some type of slip prevention.  My tub, and all new-ish fiberglass tub surrounds, actually made the bottom somewhat wavy as an anti-slip measure. Not only do they not work at all, they provide channels for soapy water that don't drain as fast. You also cannot use any type of non-slip mat because the suction cups won't adhere to the bottom due to the waviness, and the anti-slip strips won't adhere. This was never a problem with old tubs - I could use mats with the flat, slippery surface. But now, even with a grab bar, getting out of a slippery tub, using the grab bar, and stepping over the side has become very dangerous. It is to the point that I am putting off showering and doing more sponge baths and washing my hair in the sink. I only slip rarely, but it is enough to make me afraid to take showers in that tub. I am getting older, and my balance is not the best either. Your in-laws may be able to ride bikes, but that's not the same type of movement needed to get in and out of a slippery tub.\n\nI wanted to say this because it may be something your in-laws experience too, but may be afraid or uncomfortable explaining. They may not want to tell their children that they are having balance issues.\n\nAnyway, just thought I would add a different perspective from somebody who is afraid to use a tub/shower combo.
