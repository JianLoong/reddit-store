It's not just the stepping over the side of the tub to get in and out - a grab bar mounted in the studs immediately to the side of the tub enclosure help. But I see many people saying to install some type of slip prevention.  My tub, and all new-ish fiberglass tub surrounds, actually made the bottom somewhat wavy as an anti-slip measure. Not only do they not work at all, they provide channels for soapy water that don't drain as fast. You also cannot use any type of non-slip mat because the suction cups won't adhere to the bottom due to the waviness, and the anti-slip strips won't adhere. This was never a problem with old tubs - I could use mats with the flat, slippery surface. But now, even with a grab bar, getting out of a slippery tub, using the grab bar, and stepping over the side has become very dangerous. It is to the point that I am putting off showering and doing more sponge baths and washing my hair in the sink. I only slip rarely, but it is enough to make me afraid to take showers in that tub. I am getting older, and my balance is not the best either. Your in-laws may be able to ride bikes, but that's not the same type of movement needed to get in and out of a slippery tub.\n\nI wanted to say this because it may be something your in-laws experience too, but may be afraid or uncomfortable explaining. They may not want to tell their children that they are having balance issues.\n\nAnyway, just thought I would add a different perspective from somebody who is afraid to use a tub/shower combo.

But then I can no longer run either and climbing ladders would end up in a hospital visit - probably after the second rung.\n\nThey sound like they really don't *need* it but they want it and don't care if they have to stomp all over your boundaries to get what they'd prefer. This is unbelievably rude. I think you have various options. Two of which could be\n\n* try to get them to reduce their visits (I saw someone mentioned they'd got you up after surgery which is dreadful). Here though it partly depends on how those visits are currently managed: do they just turn up and expect to be housed?, do they have a set day each month (last Monday/second Tuesday)? Do you mutually agree a day for their visit or do they phone and tell you what they expect? Your strategies for tackling them will partly depend on how this situation has emerged.\n* tell them that you haven't liked to complain but them using your bathroom is seriously disruptive to you and you have especially especially upgraded their bathroom to stop the need for this. Either have the grab bars installed (mine are at just above waist height - you need one at a convenient point for them to hold onto as they step into the bath and possibly one they can hold as they get up from the bath). If you're feeling flush, get the bath replaced with a walk-in shower as you don't need to redo the entire bathroom to do this. Look for advertisement for seniors, there are companies that offer this - a simple unit that can be inserted when the bath is taken out though use the company or a proper plumber. I would also ostentatiously ensure grab bars are put in this too as your ILs are apparently too frail to step over a bath edge......... (we all know it's lies but that's what they are pretending. You'll probably have to paint the bathroom as it's not a simple process to remove and install.
