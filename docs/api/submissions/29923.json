You're already aware of the safety measures you need to be taking with regard to the litter boxes and you are very right about treating pets as disposable commodities. \n\nThe top result if you google \"Can I keep my cat while I am pregnant \" is from the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and says-\n\n>Yes, you can keep your cat. You may have heard that cat feces can carry the infection toxoplasmosis. This infection is only found in cats who go outdoors and hunt prey, such as mice and other rodents. If you do have a cat who goes outdoors or eats prey, have someone else take over daily cleaning the litter box. This will keep you away from any cat feces. If you have an indoor cat who only eats cat food and doesn\u2019t have contact with outside animals, your risk of toxoplasmosis is very low\n\nTell the busybodies that you prefer to get your medical advice from your health care professionals.", "NTA. Toxoplasmosis is very serious, but the risk can totally be mitigated as long as you're hygienic and baby proof so that your kid can never get into the litter boxes. Thousands (at least) of women have pregnancies while sharing a home with cats. Baby dad can clean the boxes during your pregnancy and going forward make sure everyone washes their hands after doing so.", "Keep your kitties. I had three cats when my babies were born.

You'd be the AH if you were to get rid of your cats, let alone do it because of the baseless fears of somebody else.\n\nThe standard way to handle the problem of the litter box is to let somebody else do it while you're pregnant.

Did she ask you that just so she could berate you?! because it kind of comes off like that. Plenty of women have successful, healthy pregnancies while also have a cat. It doesn't take a whole lot of extra effort to keep yourself safe. Maybe changing the litter becomes your partner's chore for the duration of your pregnancy. Honestly, Josie being so quick to judge you and calling you an AHis a red flag and i'd be questioning if this is actually a relationship worth having in your life", "Ask your HR team whether being called an asshole and a shit mother for not getting rid of household pets is an acceptable workplace interaction.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

I agree with you. \n\nYour friend might have started off out of concern for you, but she took it on whole another level. \n\nPets are a part of family.

I wouldn\u2019t be able to remain friends with someone who expected me to get rid of beloved pets over something that is not actually a risk. No doctor in their right mind would advise you get rid of your cats. I am only using pregnancy as an excuse not to clean litter boxes because my sweet husband is humoring me about it - our cats are indoor and we\u2019ve had them both for more than a decade, there\u2019s basically zero risk of new toxoplasmosis infection.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, that isn't how toxoplasmosis works. It isn't some disease that every cat has forever. It's parasites and they shed them for 2 weeks in their poop, about 10-12 days after they become infected. Once they stop shedding them, *they stop shedding them.* The risk of infection is for those 2 weeks. If you've had those cats for months, then unless you let them outside to go eat infected animals, you have nothing to worry about. Source: I rescued a feral cat and her kittens and she actually had toxo and I did all the necessary things until she stopped shedding them. She's been in my house now for 2 years. No more toxo.\n\nSecond, you would be TA if you got rid of your cats. Because they aren't disposable, they're family members.\n\nYour friend is an idiot. And quite frankly, if my friend was demanding I just toss my cats away like old shoes, that friend would be an ex-friend really fast.", "NTA. Everything you told Josie is correct. Also having cats will help protect your child against getting allergies.", "No. Thanks for your concern, Josie, but no one asked. NTA.", "NTA", "I have 3 kids (youngest now 18) and we have always had cats since before they were born. Still have 3. They are family.\n\nWtf is wrong with your 'friend'?", "NTA. And I applaud you for keeping your pets. Not many people do it nowadays and the shelters are suffering.", "NTA. Get rid of the friend, not the cats.", "I had toxoplasmosis while pregnant. Got it from the garden, not my cat. \ud83e\udee0 had cats since a baby and never had it so it\u2019s standard here to test in early pregnancy and later on again.", "NTA While there is a risk, with effort, the risk can be managed.

Too much internet for her and not enough thinking.", "NTA, and that ain't your friend.", "NTA \nCongrats on your baby and your awesome cats.", "Look at all those families out there who don't get a cat until after baby 1 or 2 is there and have more babies after. Are they supposed to just not have cats ever until menopause? Are only child-free people allowed to have cats? This is a dumb take from your 'friend' and you're NTA at all. I'd also have a very stern talk with people at work that your home life is none of their business and that it's pretty gross that they're sitting there in their judgmental chairs, judging you for living your life the way you want and doing so in a smart way and not in a hyperbolic reactionary way.
