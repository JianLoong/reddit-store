You're already aware of the safety measures you need to be taking with regard to the litter boxes and you are very right about treating pets as disposable commodities. \n\nThe top result if you google \"Can I keep my cat while I am pregnant \" is from the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and says-\n\n>Yes, you can keep your cat. You may have heard that cat feces can carry the infection toxoplasmosis. This infection is only found in cats who go outdoors and hunt prey, such as mice and other rodents. If you do have a cat who goes outdoors or eats prey, have someone else take over daily cleaning the litter box. This will keep you away from any cat feces. If you have an indoor cat who only eats cat food and doesn\u2019t have contact with outside animals, your risk of toxoplasmosis is very low\n\nTell the busybodies that you prefer to get your medical advice from your health care professionals.", "NTA. Toxoplasmosis is very serious, but the risk can totally be mitigated as long as you're hygienic and baby proof so that your kid can never get into the litter boxes.

Baby dad can clean the boxes during your pregnancy and going forward make sure everyone washes their hands after doing so.", "Keep your kitties. I had three cats when my babies were born.

You'd be the AH if you were to get rid of your cats, let alone do it because of the baseless fears of somebody else.\n\nThe standard way to handle the problem of the litter box is to let somebody else do it while you're pregnant.

Did she ask you that just so she could berate you?! because it kind of comes off like that. Plenty of women have successful, healthy pregnancies while also have a cat. It doesn't take a whole lot of extra effort to keep yourself safe. Maybe changing the litter becomes your partner's chore for the duration of your pregnancy.

I wouldn\u2019t be able to remain friends with someone who expected me to get rid of beloved pets over something that is not actually a risk. No doctor in their right mind would advise you get rid of your cats. I am only using pregnancy as an excuse not to clean litter boxes because my sweet husband is humoring me about it - our cats are indoor and we\u2019ve had them both for more than a decade, there\u2019s basically zero risk of new toxoplasmosis infection.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, that isn't how toxoplasmosis works. It isn't some disease that every cat has forever. It's parasites and they shed them for 2 weeks in their poop, about 10-12 days after they become infected. Once they stop shedding them, *they stop shedding them.* The risk of infection is for those 2 weeks. If you've had those cats for months, then unless you let them outside to go eat infected animals, you have nothing to worry about. Source: I rescued a feral cat and her kittens and she actually had toxo and I did all the necessary things until she stopped shedding them. She's been in my house now for 2 years. No more toxo.\n\nSecond, you would be TA if you got rid of your cats. Because they aren't disposable, they're family members.\n\nYour friend is an idiot. And quite frankly, if my friend was demanding I just toss my cats away like old shoes, that friend would be an ex-friend really fast.", "NTA. Everything you told Josie is correct. Also having cats will help protect your child against getting allergies.", "No. Thanks for your concern, Josie, but no one asked. NTA.", "NTA", "I have 3 kids (youngest now 18) and we have always had cats since before they were born. Still have 3. They are family.\n\nWtf is wrong with your 'friend'?", "NTA.

Are they supposed to just not have cats ever until menopause? Are only child-free people allowed to have cats? This is a dumb take from your 'friend' and you're NTA at all. I'd also have a very stern talk with people at work that your home life is none of their business and that it's pretty gross that they're sitting there in their judgmental chairs, judging you for living your life the way you want and doing so in a smart way and not in a hyperbolic reactionary way.

Same goes for when my daughter made her grand entrance.\n\nI had the best two kitties that were her guardian angels. Before she was born, they were always on my belly, rubbing their scents on it, purring, napping, being generally sweet and adorable.\n\nAfter she was born, they surrounded her. They'd been trained not to get in her crib before she was born, but they'd sit and sleep right beside it. One pressed against each side of me during feeding and baby cuddle times. They knew not to get on her, they just had to constantly be near her.\n\nIf visitors that they didn't know well came by, they would stand between the \"newcomers\" and wherever the baby was like they were her bodyguards. They'd hiss, growl, yowl, and arch their backs until the visitors were greeted in a friendly manner. Then the cats would realize these \"strangers\" were okay in my book, and they'd let the Very Suspicious Humans near the baby (although they kept an eye on them until they knew them better.) Every interaction that didn't involve folks they didn't know near the baby, they were the sweetest, most affectionate cats. Never hissed, they cuddled in everyone's laps, one would climb onto his favorite peoples' chests and wrap his arms around your neck and head while purring - he gave hugs!!! Seriously, his hugs were the best and it was wild to see the 180\u00b0 he'd do if he felt that OUR kitten was in danger.\n\nThe other cat was so protective, she'd come and get me if the munchkin started moving in her crib or fussing. I have a hard time falling and staying asleep, but when it catches up to me, I tend to be dead to the world. There were several times that she came and would gently tap me with her paw while meowing quietly to wake me up, only for me to discover the baby had just woken up and needed to be changed/fed/etc.\n\nShe wouldn't even let me change the baby's diaper by myself. She would jump onto the changing table and wedge herself under baby girl's head as a pillow, or between her head and the edge of the changing table where there was a decorative edge built in. One time the cat was sleeping. I was sleep deprived and not paying enough attention to detail. I laid the baby down on the changing table and accidentally placed her too close to the top edge. I lifted her feet to do the scoot-wipe-scoot fast diaper change (you know the one). Her head slid up towards the edge, and I suddenly heard the loudest, most demanding *MRREEOOOWWWWWWW* from this tiny, sweet cat. She jumped up, wedged herself in the space between the baby and the edge (YES, I had to pull the baby back towards the middle because of this, there was an inch of space max). She glared at me like I was intentionally trying to hit kiddo's head on the edge and was so agitated, her tail kept hitting my arm. Like, thank you, sweet kitty, for keeping my sleep-deprived self from accidentally hurting what is very obviously OUR baby.\n\nSometimes I think those two were more human than they were cat.

She's ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\nI changed the litter boxes almost daily throughout all of my pregnancies and nothing happened. \n\nJust wash your hands after you've touched cat shit, which I'm sure any sane person would do anyway.\n\nYour friend needs to calm down. There's going to be a whole host of legitimate worries once the baby comes along, and you don't need neurotic, ill-informed people around you adding their nonsense to that list.", "NTA!!! All you have to do is stay away from the litter box. Besides, if your cats never got to a rodent with it there\u2019s no risk. If your cats are indoors the risk is very low.", "NTA - these people clearly don\u2019t understand the actual issue and re probably basing their fears offf of headlines and not the real situation in daily life. You can also already have it or antibodies by being exposed to it - you can get testing done to see. But ya the litter can just be cleaned by your partner, no harm done. As a cat owner and breeder, you may find that the cats get territorial or act up like peeing outside the box as your pregnancy progresses though, my friend had that issue.", "NTA the only reason (in my opinion) to rehome an animal when you have a baby is if the animal becomes aggressive or a danger to the baby in some other way. I.e. baby is terribly allergic or you can\u2019t keep them from trying to sleep on the baby.", "Sounds like peak clucking hens to me. NTA. It sounds like she wanted to create a controversial topic and make you listen to her. You aren't the a hole and know how to handle the situation, without her help or input.", "NTA. I would take the risks seriously though. Your partner can change the litter box until after the baby comes.", "NTA We had cats and my husband cleaned the litter box during pregnancy. I\u2019m surprised a whole office thinks that is not good enough.", "NTA\n\nToo many please think animals are disposable just because they have a baby. You are a good parent and pet owner. Plus it can help teach the baby to be gentle with animals. You keep those cats.", "NTA. My family always had pets. We had both dogs and cats, and my parents had them before, during and after my mum's pregnancies with me and my sister. No issue with our cats being around my sister during her pregnancy or the baby when she was born, either.\n\nPets are part of the family. They're living, breathing creatures, and are in no way disposable. Anyone who says you should throw away a pet, for any reason, is a monster in my opinion. \n\nObviously do what needs to be done to keep yourself and baby safe, but with cats, that's just things like washing hands and asking your partner to change the litter box, keeping an eye out when baby is born to make sure the baby or cats don't get hurt. \n\nI'll tell you this, my eldest cat at the time, Scooby, was awesome with my sister when she was pregnant. She used to curl up on my sister's stomach and pad at the spot my niece was kicking. It really helped my sister relax. When my niece was born, Scooby and her own daughter Suggs became little guard cats whenever they were visiting. One would always be there watching over the baby and hissing and spitting at anyone who came near. They were my nieces most fierce protectors.", "Your partner can scoop the litter box for 9 months. That\u2019s what OBs tell you to do. It\u2019s not that serious.\n\nThere is no reason you should have to give up your cats. I had one cat that was feral and another that was extremely attached to me and I didn\u2019t know how he was going to handle the newcomer when he arrived, so the main accommodation we made was change out the nursery room door with a screen door that had a little hook lock on the outside and inside so we could keep the cats out of the nursery if we needed to but they could still see in there and it not cause them any stress or anxiety. We only closed the door when the baby was sleeping in the crib. \n\nTurns out they were scared of him anyway and would never have jumped in the crib so it was a moot point but it didn\u2019t hurt to have that safety measure in place just in case.", "NTA\nMy daughter has had her 2 cats forever.  She was recently pregnant.  Her husband changed the litter as needed.  They tried to change the litter to a natural type.

He does the litter now but it has never crossed anyone\u2019s mind to suggest we get rid of them. My cats are my BABIES. You would be the AH if you got rid of your cats. There are lots of ways to keep safe from toxoplasmosis without rehoming your beloved pets.", "NTA and I\u2019d go to HR about her creating a hostile work environment", "NTA. Literally don\u2019t even waste your breath lol, I\u2019m sorry your friend\u2019s an idiot.", "NTA.\nYour partner can change the litter box.\nJosie and your other coworkers can mind their business.\nYou're correct - pets aren't disposable.", "Nta.

Your friend is right in some of her tirade, but also very wrong. You're not just going to get toxoplasmosis by having cats. As long as your partner cleans the boxes while you're pregnant and you don't let your baby near the boxes, you should be fine. Especially if your partner is wearing gloves, washes their hands, and your cats are groomed so they don't spread litter too far around the house. \n\nI had folks asking me the same thing about my dogs when I was pregnant. \"Oh, you're going to get rid of that big one, right? It'll attack the baby!\" - I take great pleasure in telling those folks that my dog (a rottweiler/german shepherd mix) loves my kids and would take on anybody that would try and hurt them.

Move the litter box where the Mom doesn't go much. A back porch? Old bedroom noone uses? Basement? Have the Husband clean the box during the pregnancy. *clean it more then normal* Cats are family your friend went to the extreme.", "NTA- I\u2019m guessing none of these people have medical licenses? When my wife was pregnant she was worried about this but we never considered getting rid of our cats. I changed the litter the whole time and even her Dr said that yes, be careful but people blow the whole cat/pregnant women thing out of the water when it comes to how much of an actual issue it is.", "Report her to HR. She\u2019s getting people to gossip and gang up on you, over something that\u2019s not her business. Plenty of people have cats, and it\u2019s easy enough to wear gloves and a dust mask to prevent breathing in the dust and directly touching the fecal matter. If you\u2019re now extra concerned, you can also purchase those self cleaning litter boxes so that you don\u2019t have to sift through the sand yourself.\n\nUnless you let your cats outside, they will not have toxoplasmosis if they\u2019re indoor cats.
