Does your wife have a medical degree?\n\nThat being said, it's already a bit concerning that your wife refuses to acknowledge your son's \"potential\" ASD. If 4 psychologists and 3 therapists already listed it as a confirmation, why deny the accuracy?", "NTA\n\nSharing medical records with other providers is a common practice.", "NTA. \n\nThis is relevant past medical history. If she disagrees with the initial assessment, then she will. But knowing the history is important for medical professionals so they know what to assess for.", "NTA. It's very common for people in your wife's position to not want to believe the diagnosis. They think that if they label their kid as \\_\\_\\_, they'll be pigeonholed and grow up being treated like \\_\\_\\_ and spend the rest of their lives being \\_\\_\\_\\_. But if they just ignore it, the kid will absorb neurotypical traits by osmosis and eventually catch up. But that's not how it works.\n\nASD therapy is obviously an evolving thing and you should do your research on practitioners and methodology, but overall their whole goal is to allow your kid to get as close to \"normal\" as possible, from talking through behavioral norms that will allow them to fit in to speech support.\n\nAs an adult who is non-neutotypical, I am SO GLAD that my parents diagnosed me early. I needed support, and that support was invaluable, yes. But the bigger privilege was that I understood from a young age that I wasn't broken or stupid or just not trying hard enough. I knew that I needed strategies and hd the space over my childhood to develop those strategies in partnership with the adults/teachers in my life. On a more practical note, it did not \"follow me\" anywhere where I didn't want it to follow me. I've never chosen to formally disclose it to my university or in any job application, nor had it been found out retroactively. But I've been able to obtain treatment much more easily because I'm able to walk into a medical office and say \"I have a documented history of this dating back to age 5.\" That makes a world of difference.", "NTA.  You and your wife got a second opinion and that confirmed the diagnosis.  When getting a second opinion they need to know what the first opinion was.\n\nIt sounds like your wife is in denial about your son's diagnosis.  If your son had been misdiagnosed by the previous group the new group wouldn't have referenced that report in their assessment, except to say that the diagnosis was incorrect.  They referenced the report and confirmed the diagnosis.", "NTA - if this was any other potential diagnosis, say cancer, you would want the medical practitioners to have all the information available wouldn't you?", "NTA. I'm about 15 years further along this journey than you and your wife and it gets way less scary as time marches on. A diagnosis doesn't change anything, but it's hard for some of us to come to that realization. Good luck my friend and welcome to the tribe", "NTA. The would most likely have come to the same conclusions. Why put your son through all of that twice?", "NTA\n\nYour medical records should all be provided to your new medical professionals.  That's pretty much how it works.\n\nI can understand your wife wanting your son to be assessed without any preconceived ideas, but if the recommendations in the report were working for you son in your home country then surely telling his new therapists what these were is a no brainer.\n\nIt does sounds like your wife was hoping the therapists would come up with a different diagnosis which is why she's angry about you giving them the information.  The problem seems to your wife's attitude towards autism rather than anything you did.", "NTA", "NTA- it\u2019s relevant past medication information", "NTA. Your wife is in a truly ridiculous amount of denial. I really hope it isn\u2019t coming from shame over having a \u201cdefective\u201d* kid, but I\u2019ve seen that attitude FAR too many times. You guys need a BIG talk and she needs to deal with her shit. Accept it. Because otherwise she\u2019s going to cause your kid a LOT of damage. \n\n* Autism is a natural brain difference and not a defect but there is a LOT of prejudice.", "As someone whose been in the system since 7 it\u2019s always best when going to a new place to tell everything. My mom decided when I transferred school I shouldn\u2019t tell them I had adhd or anxiety ( now also know it was more lol ) even though I literally had went from a special aid class all my life to a normal class. Trust me they knew something was wrong and eventually asked me who admitted what I had and I actually ended up getting help even if my mom didn\u2019t want to actually agree to all of the help\u2026 \nNTA", "NTA.\n\nIf these therapists thought that you providing them the report would interfere with their ability to assess your son, they would have said so when you provided it for them. And then, you know, not looked at it. \n\nYour wife is just scrambling for a reason to not have your son be diagnosed with ASD.", "NTA.\n\nMedical professionals need as much information as possible to make any diagnosis.", "NTA but your wife needs to be removed competently from your sons healthcare. You will need to be the point person to manage everything. My mom was like your wife and denied that I had autism so hard she got people to diagnose me with bipolar instead. I was then put on medications that resulted in a stroke (which people with asd have increased risk of anyway, and the medication I was on was known for causing strokes). It\u2019s essential that you as the parent who exists in reality handle ALL of your sims health needs, and do not allow her to interfere in any way.", "NAH - I suppose you should have let your wife know before giving the new therapist his previous diagnosis, but I\u2019d like to think that they would do their own independent assessment regardless of a previous report. But if your wife was seriously concerned about a mis-diagnosis you shouldn\u2019t have provided all that information. Either way, good for you for getting your son the help he needs. I don\u2019t think either of you are inherently in the wrong.", "NAH - I understand where she's coming from. Especially if she thinks he was misdiagnosed, but I think it's fine that you were trying to avoid reinventing the wheel by setting his therapist up with all the information you felt was pertinent. I think this boils down to miscommunication. The default should be to disclose everything to the therapist (so they can do the best job) so if she wanted to confirm the diagnosis, she should have spoken to you first on withholding that information.", "NTA. Your wife is trying to pretend this diagnosis doesn't exist and is looking for someone to agree with her.", "NTA. I do agree that it is common practice to review all medical records. In theory, and in practice (in most cases), the complete record would be best.\n\nHowever, I do think there can be value in getting a 2nd opinion on something without sending the first opinion when you think the first opinion was potentially inaccurate. In my experience, being in healthcare for many years, it can be difficult to actually get a 2nd opinion that isn't influenced by the first, and that can be a bad thing. Healthcare professionals often don't want to outright contradict other healthcare professionals. I am not in any way saying that is what is happening here, but as a general concept, wanting fresh eyes on a situation does not automatically mean someone is in denial about a diagnosis. Mistakes aren't uncommon, and they can be compounded in some situations by over reliance on previous assessments.", "YTA. \nYou knew that your wife had concerns about the previous diagnosis. Also, the diagnosis is not valid in your new country. Finally, those records should be completely irrelevant to what the new team is doing. \nThey should make their diagnosis or assessment completely independent of a previous report, especially since this is does involve any physical  pathology.  There are no x-rays or other medical records that would be of use.  \n\nIn short, these assessments are subjective, so I don\u2019t see how the previous assessment would be of any value to the new team.", "YTA\n\nYou and your wife have different views on the diagnosis. \n\nYou say your son was previously diagnosed by \"4 therapists in 2 days and a half\". From the way you wrote it, the checkup was done at a single clinic, right? They had multiple doctors, but you got back *one* report, right? If that's the case, you cannot consider you had a \"second opinion\", which is what your wife really wants.\n\nYour wife is desperately looking for a second opinion. You had the chance to get exactly that. An unbiased, second opinion, which could have confirmed the original diagnosis.\n\nUnfortunately, now you'll never know. By sharing the original diagnosis you influenced the new doctors. You cannot be sure now how much is their own-made opinion, and how much of it was influenced by the previous report, because it just fit the symptoms.\n\nYou were wrong and you are not doing your son a favor by denying him a second, uninfluenced, opinion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It would have been irresponsible to NOT share past medical information with current providers.\n\nAs an adult autistic woman, I\u2019m am enraged at your wife on behalf of your child. She cares more about your child appearing normal than about your child\u2019s actual well-being.\n\nI\u2019m in my forties. I received my diagnosis less than two years ago. You know what my mother\u2019s denial did? It taught me to internalize EVERYTHING because she wasn\u2019t a safe person for me. It taught me to mask. Instead of acknowledging my neurodivergence and working with it to my benefit, I pretended to be normal, didn\u2019t learn things that neurotypicals learn naturally, and ended up in situations that led to PTSD and severe depression.", "NTA.

But if this is not the US, take it from someone with experience, all the doctors in the world can not \"fix\" him, and not socializing him while young is only detrimental, and I am not talking about his family or best friends.  These individuals are already knowledgeable on his situation, and the more situations he can be in, ie with his peer group, is better.\n\nBy the way your wife is obviously going through some form of denial, and must realize she needs to support her child in the proper way to garner success", "It\u2019s also best for docs to have that info so they can review, compare, and potentially come up with different/better treatments\n\nThere\u2019s a reason they ask for medical history, even if not \u201cvalid\u201d in their current country, OPs kid\u2019s medical history still exists and should be communicated as such", "Right?

I\u2019d understand a second opinion but damn\u2026 what you should be asking and worried about is if your wife is going to be accepting ever of your son the way he is or is she going to for his whole life deny it? The latter isn\u2019t a healthy environment for the lad", "Going to add onto this as an adult who is currently trying to get an ASD diagnosis (my psych can't do it but both she and my therapist believe I'm on the spectrum). I didn't get a chance to develop any sort of coping strategies and that has followed me into being an adult.\n\nI was talking to my mom very recently and she regrets not pushing for a more thorough diagnosis when I was going into special ed. A lot of things slipped through the cracks; while I wait for someone to get back to me I'm stuck trying to duct tape those cracks as they grow larger and larger.\n\nOP's wife is as it stands currently trying to block any potential help that kid gets, probably due to the stigma, but she will end up failing him in the long run.", "Such a great point. I have a friend with what was formerly known as Asperger\u2019s and he credits his parents for getting him a ton of help and support while he was growing up. By the time I met him when we were 16 he\u2019d already done a lot of work on himself and was leaps and bounds ahead of where he used to be (in his words).\n\nMeanwhile I have ADHD and while not as severe as his Asperger\u2019s, I didn\u2019t get any support or diagnosis as a child and grew up thinking I was lazy and broken, because that\u2019s either what I was told directly, or what was communicated in more subtle ways, my entire childhood. It takes a long time to unlearn those lessons and it wreaks havoc on your mental/emotional well-being for decades.", ">But if your wife was seriously concerned about a mis-diagnosis you shouldn\u2019t have provided all that information.\n\nNo, they needed that information to rule out the original diagnosis.  What OP and his wife got was basically a second opinion.  There have been many reports of people going for second opinions and that doctor going \"What was the first one thinking?!  They were wrong!\"\n\nPersonal story time:\n\nWhen I was three, I was finally diagnosed with migraines.  This was in **1983** and imaging technology sucked so \"exploratory surgery\" was commonplace (MRI was invented in 1985).  The first group of neurologists that my mom took me to wanted to do some exploratory brain surgery to find the tumor they were convinced existed and they'd diagnosed me with.  My mom told the \"Hell no\" and took me to a second opinion private practice pediatric neurologist.  They redid all of the tests and had my mom keep a headache diary of everything I'd eaten, what the weather was like, and how much I'd slept.  The neurologist then diagnosed me with \"chronic childhood onset migraines with *no* indication of a brain tumor.\"  The second opinion doctor knew about the brain tumor diagnosis and didn't confirm it.  I'm now almost 43 and still have migraines but no tumor has popped up on any MRI.", "You know there's a reason when you go to NEW doctors, they request OLD records right? To see what's been or hasn't been diagnosed/addressed.", "Good point! Yeah, I feel like the wife may just be in denial.", "I need more information. In your home country are women typically blamed for anything that's wrong with the child they gave birth to? Are they discriminated against in your community for it? Will this affect her family and their future(education options, choice of spouse?) This may impact her choices. If not, then I agree with the people below. If so, you got bigger problems.", "NTA.", "NTA - as a therapist seeing kids I always ask about any precious diagnosis, it\u2019s standard to inquire.", "NTA", "NTA.

At that point reconciling the two.", "Not to mention their child was removed from kindergarten because the school didn't have the resources to care for a child with autism, that was before the father shared information with the newest therapist. So it is enough of a problem that it is affecting the child. Her denial is actively hindering him from thriving. If he has a valid diagnosis for the country they are in, hopefully he can get the care and guidance needed to grow manage his differences.  It isn't shameful!  I was actually excited when my daughter had some pings on the spectrum simply because it meant she has an IEP in school and is able to get some specialized help that has made her school life so much better, and even helped her manage her emotions and communicate her thoughts better in general.", "Exactly. It sounds like she desperately doesn't want it to be true. I worry that she might try something desperate, like the various quack \"cures\" you can find on the internet.", "My kiddo got his \u201cofficial\u201d diagnosis after about half an hour with a doctor. Because sometimes it really is that obvious, especially to a trained person. At the time I remember hearing about studies where early childhood development specialists trained to recognize ASD in kids could watch home movies of first birthday parties and pick out the kids who\u2019d gotten diagnosed later from the general population with near perfect accuracy.", "Yeah -  and fundamentally okay let's say you're diagnosed with ADHD as a kid. You're given support, you're validated, and you're given grace when you make mistakes. You work closely with adults and develop custom strategies for taking notes, for paying attention in boring settings, for remembering your lunch, for motivating yourself to do something you're dreading. And then one day they invent a magic perfect test where it's revealed that you technically don't have ADHD, you're just disorganized and inattentive. Okay well I guess you developed all of those executive functioning and prioritization and organizational skills for nothing then.\n\nI have ADHD and benefited from having a parent with diagnosed ADHD as well. It was far from perfect and took a lot of push-and-pull, and I still struggled with feeling inadequate but it's different when you can label it. I know multiple people who were told as adults \"oh yeah we got you assessed and they said you had \\_\\_, did we never mention that?\" To me, that's like letting your kid grow up without telling them they have a bad leg and letting them wonder why everyone else is so much better at running than they are.", "Do not let your wife treat your child differently because of an ASD diagnosis.

My daughter was working on a diagnosis before we immigrated to our new country and it was that information I provided, that helped them determined her trajectory.  What they witness firsthand, will matter more in the end, but it NEVER hurts to supply them with prior details and documents from your previous country.  In fact, it could help them make a more well rounded decision.  As others are saying, it sounds like your wife is hoping a little too deeply that this diagnosis is wrong.  I'm sorry to say, it most likely \\*isn't\\* wrong.  They don't diagnose this condition on a whim.", "NTA. They can do their best evaluation if they have all the background.", "NTA.

There should never be a bias for what was written. Good clinicians base their diagnosis on their work with the child.", "NTA. Autism diagnosis are not given lightly.", "NTA, If 4 psychologists agreed that your son has ASD then he most probably does and your wife seems to be in denial of that, especially if 3 other therapists agree with it too, they're trained in this and should be capable of figuring out if a previous diagnosis is wrong, that's literally their job for which they spend years in university studying.\n\nHell it took just two to figure out that I'm on the spectrum.\n\nEdit: Also it's not uncommon for people to be in denial of their childrens' disabilities, while she's surely well intended it's the best for your kid if he gets the support he needs early.", "They\u2019re doctors\u2026.
