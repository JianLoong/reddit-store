No?

I am curious if having a service animal now was something she maybe thought she didnt have to mention because she talks about it on social media a lot and assumed you knew or something though. Her level of assholery depends on whether she was intentionally hiding this from you in case you said no, whether she's lying outright about it being a service animal (Red flag: she showed you documentation), or if she genuinely thought you knew and made an asshole mistake in not mentioning it. But she is an asshole regardless.\n\nBut unless she was lying, you did the equivilant of a friend showing up in a wheelchair that they didn't use last time you saw them and saying you don't want wheelchairs in your home because the wheels could track in dirt from outside and you dont want to clean that ip. That's kind of problematic unless there was some other allergy going on here? You aren't a place of business with a legal obligation to let in a service dog, but this is AITA not AI-Legally-Allowed. I do think morally turning one away is an asshole move unless there's an allergy or phobia involved? Just \"I don't want to clean up pet hair\" or whatever is an asshole thing.", "ESH - She should have mentioned she has a service dog (though, depending on how long she's had it, she might have assumed you already knew). You could have handled the situation a lot better, though. It's your house, and you're within your rights to not allow a friend's service dog in the house, but that absolutely qualifies as an AH attitude in my book. \"I don't care that you need this service animal to get through your life, I don't want dog hair in my house\" is pretty shitty.", "ESH. I\u2019m acc amazed the amount of people saying you\u2019re nta. It\u2019s always awkward when people reach out to you, maybe she was trying to reconnect etc, but at the end of the day she was probably just using you as a place to crash, but you never know. That makes her the AH. She also should have mentioned the dog.\n\nHowever everyone immediately presuming the dog is a fake service dog, and you refusing to allow a service dog into your home make you the AH. I get it it\u2019s your home, but you need to actually consider that these aren\u2019t pets, service animals are necessary to people, and you are essentially saying to your friend you don\u2019t care about them or with whatever they are suffering from. The fact that some dog hairs and you \u201cjust not liking them\u201d is more important than someone\u2019s safety or health is wild.\n\nI mean, also, who doesn\u2019t like dogs?

They aid people in living more independent lives, and vastly improve quality of life, too. \n\nBut the reason that I find myself torn is that even the *best* trained service animals ultimately are unlike any other piece of equipment that aids disability access, because they are a living, breathing creature. People do have allergies to them, sometimes deathly ones. Even the best-trained service animals will sometimes have accidents. When I worked as a bartender, one service dog suddenly developed diarrhea while his owner was having a few drinks with friends. It was no one's fault, the owner was mortified and so apologetic, especially as their friends had to help clean it up, as they were physically incapable of doing so. I truly felt awful for them. But we ultimately had to close for the rest of the evening, because it was a biohazard. \n\nAdditionally, the rise of fake service animals presents another problem.

God forbid people with disabilities try to live their lives.", "a rolling oxygen tank is not comparable to bringing an animal. it\u2019s her house her decision, acquaintance should have disclosed beforehand that she had a dog w her, what if the person was allergic? never just assume it\u2019s okay to bring an animal to someones house especially someone u havent seen or heard from in forever.", "I would. I have a cat who doesn\u2019t like dogs. Someone\u2019s home is not a business.", "Many people use the term service dog to cover a wide variety of situations. If her friend were blind, I think OP would have known that. And there are plenty of options for keeping up with friends that don't include having dogs in your home if they are a hard no for you.", "And if the animal starts to act up and cause a disturbance you are allowed to ask them to leave. Like if it starts damaging property, or being aggressive towards people.", "Yup, ESA designation is primarily for housing consideration. It doesn't mean these are the same as trained service dogs and can be taken everywhere. I call my cat my \"unofficial Emotional Support Animal\" (significant difference in my quality of life). I've had a medical provider offer to write me a letter to make it official, but so far I've declined since I've been able to find housing that allows my cat.", "What\u2019s the point in asking if legally you can just not answer?", "You don\u2019t get it. OP doesn\u2019t want a dog around. That\u2019s the whole point.", "I prefer people choose better animals to be around.\n\nA cow is going to shit everywhere too, but people have the common sense to leave them on farms.", "??? I was answering your question as to what OP might find objectionable about a dog peeing in their yard. Why so hostile? I have a dog and a xeriscaped yard; she can pee to her heart\u2019s content.", "That happens often. I usually just make a few new friends. Didn\u2019t mean to rile any feathers in my original comment. However, I try to do everything I can to help others whenever I can. I don\u2019t recall ever feeling like I was stepped on. I\u2019m totally fine with asserting myself when I feel that it\u2019s necessary. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. Just my opinion. I\u2019m sure that sometimes it stinks.", "OP didn't say they were allergic or afraid. They said they didn't want to deal with the hair. OP is entitled to disallow service animals for that reason, and I'm entitled to think they're an AH for doing so. Disallowing animals because you don't want to vacuum their hair isn't significantly different from disallowing wheelchairs because you're worried that one will leave tire marks on your carpet. You're entitled to do so, but it still makes you an AH.", "Yeah weirdly enough you can have compassion for just about anyone. If their priorities are dog hairs over the comfort of a person then that\u2019s their moral compass, it ain\u2019t mine and I\u2019ll look down on people for that", "Ok here\u2019s the thing though. This friend was going to a concert, with loud music, flashing lights, pyrotechnics\u2026all things that could trigger seizures and in all that noise and chaos would the dog REALLY be able to perform its task? I think that\u2019s why people are questioning the legitimacy of THIS \u201cservice dog\u201d and that the guest never mentioned it to OP before showing up at the door.", "So if my service dog alerts me to oncomming seizures and cardiac changes....im just never allowed to go to my friends house?

He was very anxious about the surgery.", "I\u2019m my dog\u2019s emotional support person. She is a rescue from a puppy mill. She was a breeding dog until about a year ago, when she was surrendered to a rescue. Since we\u2019ve had her, she clings to me in all unfamiliar situations. I always joke that she trained me.", "You don't seem to understand service dogs, given the phrase \"that you need this dog to survive\". Service animals are there to provide aid in dealing with a disability, in various ways. If you start drawing a line at \"you are only entitled to aid if you otherwise would not survive\" you would be making the lifes of disabled people a lot harder. Many things are not \"necessary for survival\" but do regardless improve the lifes of people with disabilities.  \n\n\nOne of the reasons many are against requiring registration of service dogs is because that opens the door for gatekeeping whether an individual is \"disabled enough\" to need a service animal, what kind of tasks performed by an animal can qualify as a service dog, and perhaps the largest: cost. In the US especially, where disability accommodations are something people tend to have to pay for themselves, self-training a service dog is the only way many people have access to them.", "Similar to my leg braces, my service dog doesn\u2019t keep me alive but does help me leave the house and navigate the world. And I do have a drivers liscense like thing for her but although I\u2019ve preemptively offered to show it to many people, no one has ever accepted", "your last point is the crux of the matter. there is a balancing act of your privacy and access and the dealing with the frauds. \n\nthe approach of \"protects our access and our privacy\" its a clear case of \"you deal with it\" with regards to any cost of dealing with fraudsters.\n\nregarding your privacy. given that you already have to admit a SD is an SD, showing a card attesting to that effect causes no injury to privacy in excess of what is necessary already for the access. actually this causes less injury to privacy because in the us today it is permitted to inquire as to the service the dog provides whereas a card can just say \"SD\" and nothing more. \n\nregarding access - the same logic applies there is no injury here in excess of what is already necessary due to the dog being, well, a dog. \n\nbut, are you willing at all to say, that fraudsters should have some push back? or do you say, no, someone else's problem?", "An emotional support animal is a housing qualification. It doesn't have to do anything tasks but it improves your health by vibing near you.\n\nA service animal is trained to perform disability-related tasks.", "ESAs are literally just pets recommended to you by a therapist. Also they can be basically be any (legal) animal. You can have an emotional support turkey if you wanted.\n\nThe only official advantage of an ESA over a pet is in regards to housing. Though other places like air travel companies and hotels may allow ESAs voluntarily no one is actually  required to accommodate one unless you are renting out an actual residence.\n\nServices animals are a different category that instead fall under ADA rules. When requesting a disability accomodations under the ADA, you don't need to disclose it, or provide a doctor's note or anything. You just say you have a disability, and require some specific accommodation. And maybe negotiate on alternatives of your request isn't actually reasonable for the situation.\n\nAs such service animals get \"reasonable\" access to all public places, unless there is a very compelling reason not to. And similarly there isn't a need to prove or justify anything beyond a statement that they are a service animal, and what tasks they trained to do. Oh and also they can only be dogs or miniature horses.", "but that wasn\u2019t your argument: you said that there is \u201creally not\u201d a difference between a service animal and a wheelchair. *only that* is what i responded to.\n\nof course you are fully entitled to call OP an AH and I am not judging you for that - after all this is what this sub is for. \n\nstill, that wasn\u2019t what you originally expressed.", "How does compassion come into play in this scenario? The friend isn\u2019t someone who is struggling or in need, they just wanted a free place to crash to go to a concert. You believe we need to show \u201ccompassion\u201d to people who *need* to go to concerts? That the need for a concert is more important that someone else\u2019s comfort in their own home? The the rudeness and gall of that \u201cfriend\u201d is ridiculous IMO.", "The friend was going to a concert; everything after that is assumption. We don't know what concert. We don't know if it was indoor or outdoor. We don't know what the dog is trained to do. We don't know if the concert is even going to have pyrotechnics and flashing lights. Presumably, Friend knows more about her own situation and whether her dog is able to perform under the conditions of a concert than we or OP does. \n\nPeople with service dogs absolutely do go to concerts, and it's completely fine. People are making a lot of assumptions about the situation based solely on the fact that she didn't specifically tell OP about the dog when it's just as possible that she's had the dog long enough and, since she reached out to OP over social media, just assumed OP knew about the dog. \n\nI'm not saying that Friend didn't do anything wrong. She *absolutely* should have warned OP that she had a service animal with her, to be clear, but all of the jumping to assumptions that it can't possibly be a service animal mostly just hurt people with service animals. People who are lying about their animals don't give a shit if you don't believe them. People who have a service animal and need it, though, are the ones who suffer.", "Then you can stay in a hotel.", "Maybe instead of just assuming it's okay like that person did you ask.", "Would you give up your privacy because of *other people* committing acts of fraud? That isn\u2019t about a balancing act, we\u2019re each entitled to a level of privacy. \n\nIf the card you\u2019re suggesting literally just says Service Dog, how would it be any different to the issues we already have with false Service Dog vests? People tend to make fake copies of things swiftly. \n\nAccess can already be rough, even with two legal questions we can be asked. Some people like to try to play guessing games regarding our illnesses, or make comments about how we *don\u2019t look disabled*. Things aren\u2019t always as smooth as simply answering questions. \n\nFraudsters should absolutely have push back. They make our lives hell too. One of my friend\u2019s Service Dogs was recently retired incredibly young after being bitten by a pretend Service Dog.\n\nBut, we can offer that pushback by asking the appropriate questions (someone refusing to answer can result in them being denied access) and removing dogs that are showing they\u2019re out of control.", "Fair enough; I was talking about it in the context of OP's story, but maybe that wasn't obvious. \n\nCertainly, there are situations where the differences between a service animal and an assistive device are relevant. A service animal also differs from a wheelchair in that one can predict the onset of seizures and the other cannot. One can transport a person, the other cannot. Definitely there are differences; in the context of the story that OP presented, the differences between them don't seem particularly relevant to the verdict, imo.", "If you literally read what I wrote I agreed in parts that the friend overstepped. But guess what, you can literally show compassion to anyone. Somebody doesn\u2019t even need to be close to you for you to show compassion.

Many of us *do* experience the questions we can already be asked to verify the legitimacy of our Service Dogs, to the point where we have rehearsed answers, even though our Service Dogs are legitimate.\n\nI know quite a few handlers whose disabilities you can see who also experience those questions regularly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the people who don\u2019t look disabled who would be questioned.\u201d\n\nHonestly, I find everything about this disgusting. Many of us already have to deal with idiots talking about how we don\u2019t *look disabled*. So many disabilities aren\u2019t visible.\n\nPeople singling us out because we don\u2019t *look disabled* isn\u2019t a solution to the wider problem here.", "> Would you give up your privacy because of other people committing acts of fraud?\n\nWe already do, all the time. For one example, people over the age of 21 (or 18, 19, etc. if you're not in the US) get carded going into bars/dispensaries/clubs, etc. because other people lie about their ages. Whether or not you agree with that as fair under the law \u2013 there are some great arguments there regarding the 4th Amendment \u2013 is a totally different story. But we absolutely do, in the US, require people to give up privacy because of others' fraud. Another interesting example is proof of vaccination in order to enter establishments in some areas during COVID. There's some really cool stuff going on in international law discussions about paper vs. QR codes in different countries and the competing rights to public safety vs. data privacy (the risk of QR codes) vs. fraud (the risk of paper cards). \n\nI agree with you that fake IDs would be a huge problem, the same way that they are with service vests, or regular old fake IDs at bars. But the violation of privacy in and of itself without wrongdoing wouldn't be the issue under US law.", "We have a different view of who deserves compassion. In this scenario the compassion should be for OP not the friend. The friend was clearly using OP and to say she needs \u201ccompassion\u201d is a bit of a stretch. Why does the friend need it? Just isn\u2019t warranted here. When people use the term compassion in these scenarios it seems like ploy for the person to be bulldozed into doing things that make them uncomfortable in the name of \u201ccompassion\u201d.  Respecting yourself and your own boundaries doesn\u2019t mean someone lacks compassion. OP had a reasonable boundary and protected it. No one was harmed and the worst that could happen is the friend had to pay for a hotel or miss her concert. IMO, OP\u2019s comfort mattered for than her \u201cfriend\u201d seeing a concert. Now if they were close friends and the reason she was visiting was a funeral or something then I would have a different opinion. Just don\u2019t think OP\u2019s comfort needs to be squashed for something as trivial as a concert. \n\nSo I guess we agree to disagree on who needs compassion and agree that the friend overstepped. Hope you have an awesome day!!", "What if they're allergic to dogs, scared of dogs, or just don't like dogs? Sorry but it's not my job to inconvenience myself for someone who I haven't spoken to since highschool. \n\nIt's crazy to feel comfortable enough to bring a dog over to someone's house like that without any warning.

People aren't getting carded because *other people* lie about their ages. You get carded to make sure *you* aren't lying about your age. Not the same thing. Also, because alcohol and tobacco are controlled substances.", "At the end of the day OP agreed to host her. She agreed to that, I agree that she should have mentioned the dog. But what OP is essentially saying is that even if she had a best friend who was blind and has a service dog, or knew someone who had a dog that alerted them of seizures, she would still rather that person\u2019s life at risk when allowing them into her home, then allow a dog, because she doesn\u2019t like dog hairs. This isn\u2019t just about that friend, as OP has said. Essentially she is barring anyone who REQUIRES a service dog into her home. Again, it\u2019s no illegal so if she is happy being that uncaring then on she goes.

You are thinking the big picture of her whole stance on service dogs in their home and I was just discussing this specific incident and not thinking bigger. Now your point about compassion makes *way* more sense to me! \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t know if I have a strong opinion on people allowing medically necessary service dogs into their homes and feel very uneducated on the topic.", "Jeez. Dog hair on your clothes is different than a whole dog being in someone's house. You got some things to figure out if you think what she did was okay."]}
