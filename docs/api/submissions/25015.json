First off fake service dogs are so rampant that I have to seriously question if it actually is one.

Ok cool, do you have any of the appropriate paperwork or anything to prove to me, a worker at this hotel, that is required by the hotel and a bunch of safety and comfort standards to check these things, that your dog is indeed a service dog? No? Why would you be so irresponsible as to not bring required documents and inform us at the time of booking? \n\nI'm not seeing any info about the dog in question, but I would probably have the same response as you did.

I am curious if having a service animal now was something she maybe thought she didnt have to mention because she talks about it on social media a lot and assumed you knew or something though. Her level of assholery depends on whether she was intentionally hiding this from you in case you said no, whether she's lying outright about it being a service animal (Red flag: she showed you documentation), or if she genuinely thought you knew and made an asshole mistake in not mentioning it. But she is an asshole regardless.\n\nBut unless she was lying, you did the equivilant of a friend showing up in a wheelchair that they didn't use last time you saw them and saying you don't want wheelchairs in your home because the wheels could track in dirt from outside and you dont want to clean that ip. That's kind of problematic unless there was some other allergy going on here? You aren't a place of business with a legal obligation to let in a service dog, but this is AITA not AI-Legally-Allowed. I do think morally turning one away is an asshole move unless there's an allergy or phobia involved? Just \"I don't want to clean up pet hair\" or whatever is an asshole thing.", "ESH - She should have mentioned she has a service dog (though, depending on how long she's had it, she might have assumed you already knew). You could have handled the situation a lot better, though. It's your house, and you're within your rights to not allow a friend's service dog in the house, but that absolutely qualifies as an AH attitude in my book. \"I don't care that you need this service animal to get through your life, I don't want dog hair in my house\" is pretty shitty.", "ESH. I\u2019m acc amazed the amount of people saying you\u2019re nta. It\u2019s always awkward when people reach out to you, maybe she was trying to reconnect etc, but at the end of the day she was probably just using you as a place to crash, but you never know. That makes her the AH. She also should have mentioned the dog.\n\nHowever everyone immediately presuming the dog is a fake service dog, and you refusing to allow a service dog into your home make you the AH. I get it it\u2019s your home, but you need to actually consider that these aren\u2019t pets, service animals are necessary to people, and you are essentially saying to your friend you don\u2019t care about them or with whatever they are suffering from. The fact that some dog hairs and you \u201cjust not liking them\u201d is more important than someone\u2019s safety or health is wild.\n\nI mean, also, who doesn\u2019t like dogs?
