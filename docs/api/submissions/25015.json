Ok cool, do you have any of the appropriate paperwork or anything to prove to me, a worker at this hotel, that is required by the hotel and a bunch of safety and comfort standards to check these things, that your dog is indeed a service dog? No? Why would you be so irresponsible as to not bring required documents and inform us at the time of booking? \n\nI'm not seeing any info about the dog in question, but I would probably have the same response as you did.

I am curious if having a service animal now was something she maybe thought she didnt have to mention because she talks about it on social media a lot and assumed you knew or something though. Her level of assholery depends on whether she was intentionally hiding this from you in case you said no, whether she's lying outright about it being a service animal (Red flag: she showed you documentation), or if she genuinely thought you knew and made an asshole mistake in not mentioning it. But she is an asshole regardless.\n\nBut unless she was lying, you did the equivilant of a friend showing up in a wheelchair that they didn't use last time you saw them and saying you don't want wheelchairs in your home because the wheels could track in dirt from outside and you dont want to clean that ip. That's kind of problematic unless there was some other allergy going on here? You aren't a place of business with a legal obligation to let in a service dog, but this is AITA not AI-Legally-Allowed. I do think morally turning one away is an asshole move unless there's an allergy or phobia involved? Just \"I don't want to clean up pet hair\" or whatever is an asshole thing.", "ESH - She should have mentioned she has a service dog (though, depending on how long she's had it, she might have assumed you already knew). You could have handled the situation a lot better, though. It's your house, and you're within your rights to not allow a friend's service dog in the house, but that absolutely qualifies as an AH attitude in my book. \"I don't care that you need this service animal to get through your life, I don't want dog hair in my house\" is pretty shitty.", "ESH. I\u2019m acc amazed the amount of people saying you\u2019re nta. It\u2019s always awkward when people reach out to you, maybe she was trying to reconnect etc, but at the end of the day she was probably just using you as a place to crash, but you never know. That makes her the AH. She also should have mentioned the dog.\n\nHowever everyone immediately presuming the dog is a fake service dog, and you refusing to allow a service dog into your home make you the AH. I get it it\u2019s your home, but you need to actually consider that these aren\u2019t pets, service animals are necessary to people, and you are essentially saying to your friend you don\u2019t care about them or with whatever they are suffering from. The fact that some dog hairs and you \u201cjust not liking them\u201d is more important than someone\u2019s safety or health is wild.\n\nI mean, also, who doesn\u2019t like dogs?

They aid people in living more independent lives, and vastly improve quality of life, too. \n\nBut the reason that I find myself torn is that even the *best* trained service animals ultimately are unlike any other piece of equipment that aids disability access, because they are a living, breathing creature. People do have allergies to them, sometimes deathly ones. Even the best-trained service animals will sometimes have accidents. When I worked as a bartender, one service dog suddenly developed diarrhea while his owner was having a few drinks with friends. It was no one's fault, the owner was mortified and so apologetic, especially as their friends had to help clean it up, as they were physically incapable of doing so. I truly felt awful for them. But we ultimately had to close for the rest of the evening, because it was a biohazard. \n\nAdditionally, the rise of fake service animals presents another problem. The ADA is designed to protect the privacy and rights of the disabled with service dogs, hence why you can't ask for ID/certification/etc. But the rise of fake service animals have resulted in cases like [these](https://abc7.com/toddler-dog-attack-girl-bitten-by-that-bit-now-in-custody-bites-at-restaurant-old-town-spring/10042002/), where a toddler's face was mauled by a fraudulent service dog.

Whether or not you agree with that as fair under the law \u2013 there are some great arguments there regarding the 4th Amendment \u2013 is a totally different story. But we absolutely do, in the US, require people to give up privacy because of others' fraud. Another interesting example is proof of vaccination in order to enter establishments in some areas during COVID.

When people use the term compassion in these scenarios it seems like ploy for the person to be bulldozed into doing things that make them uncomfortable in the name of \u201ccompassion\u201d.  Respecting yourself and your own boundaries doesn\u2019t mean someone lacks compassion. OP had a reasonable boundary and protected it. No one was harmed and the worst that could happen is the friend had to pay for a hotel or miss her concert. IMO, OP\u2019s comfort mattered for than her \u201cfriend\u201d seeing a concert. Now if they were close friends and the reason she was visiting was a funeral or something then I would have a different opinion. Just don\u2019t think OP\u2019s comfort needs to be squashed for something as trivial as a concert. \n\nSo I guess we agree to disagree on who needs compassion and agree that the friend overstepped.

Was she expecting you to take care of it or would she have been allowed to have the dog there with her? I'm not up to speed on those things and suspect that she wouldn't be able to have it with her unless she was very careful to reserve special seating.\n\nSometimes people with disabilities end up being very sweet and patient folks.

Yes, of course, because being disabled in the US is an endless litany of awfulness.  \n\nHaven't seen it yet.

I difficult chose a poodle in my example as they are a hypo-allergenic breed that doesn't really shed. German Shepherds are very much the polar opposite.

Where do we draw the line? Regular pets aren't invited into stores, etc, because it's a hygiene issue already. Service dogs are held to a higher standard, but where do you draw the line? I can go to a restaurant without my dog if I'm going with my mother or partner, but if neither of them are there, I need the dog, or I can't safely go. It's a bit unfair to be not allowed to go out with friends, isn't it? I also require the dog to do my grocery shopping and access healthcare. Both places that could arguably be said would require a hygienic environment. Should I be denied access to groceries and doctors?\n\nAs it is right now, I'm pretty independent. But remove my dog's access to public spaces, and I lose that. Unfortunately a lot of areas aren't set up to support disabled people, I don't have access to a home doctors service, I can't get my medication or groceries delivered, I can't pay someone to do the job my dog does, because those services aren't readily available and disability care is already extremely strained.\n\nMaybe one day we'll have robots that can do the job service dogs do now, and banning service dogs from public will become feasible.

It's a thin difference, but it is necessary, because bans on dogs in public places are for safety and hygiene reasons, and without this rule, they would be unenforceable.
