{"id": 17305, "submission_id": "13idd74", "title": "WIBTA Asking our friend to return a baby shower gift after a miscarriage?", "selftext": "I know this sounds awful and I feel like it might be a terrible thing to do so I need some advice.\n\nMy husband has a long term family friend named Jen. Jen and I aren't friends at all but we are friendly when we see each other. When Jen had her first kid my husband purchased a fairly expensive item off of her baby shower registry as a gift (around $200-$300 if I recall correctly). I had no issue with the gift or how much he spent, it was a nice item to gift her and we were excited for her to grow her family with her then boyfriend now husband.\n\nFast forward a few years, Jen and her husband are high earners (both making over 6 figures). Jen announced she was pregnant again very early along and sent my husband her baby shower registry with her announcement text which was full of high priced items. \n\nPersonally, I thought this was strange because she should still have most of the items from her first kid and I didn't think people usually did full blown baby showers/registries after their first. I was also surprised she was asking for gifts when she was still in the first trimester, but I'm a cautious person who didn't announce my pregnancy until 20 weeks which I know is extreme on the other side. I left it up to my husband what he wanted to do but mentioned to him that I was surprised she was organizing another shower/gifting event since she already has a young kid and got brand new stuff then. \n\nMy husband spent around $400 on a gift for her, fine with me. A few weeks later Jen had a traumatic miscarriage. I won't get into the details but she was devastated and the cause of the loss likely means she won't be able to carry future pregnancies to term. It's incredibly sad and while I'm not close with Jen my heart hurt for her. \n\nIt's been a few months since her loss and my husband is now unsure of how to navigate the gift. It's not something she can use for her older kid. Asking her to return the gift seems cruel, like adding a chore onto her grief, and it's probably past the return window anyway. I'm also not sure if she's going to keep trying to have more kids (very risky for the baby and herself) and it seems incredibly insensitive to ask, plus she may not have decided yet. Asking her to pay us back for it also seems very cruel. My husband and I are also decently high earners but $400 is still a lot of money. It's one thing if she's able to get a few years of use out of the item, that's money well spent. But if it's going to sit in a box in her attic for years....that's where we are getting stuck.\n\nSo, would we be TA if we asked about getting the gift back? Ideally we could get our money back somehow although it's probably too late. If we can't then I'd at least like to gift it to someone else who can use it (I feel awful just saying that but it's how I feel). However this is such a sensitive subject and we don't want to pressure her if she's not ready to discuss it.\n\n\nUpdate: I appreciate the feedback I've gotten. We will not be asking Jen about the gift. We don't want to make her feel worse than she already is. Given her statements in the past regarding adoption I doubt she will find alternative ways to have another child if she is unable to do so biologically. But that's her path to walk. If she doesn't use it I hope she at least donates the item to someone who needs it. \n\nPeople have also commented on my tone and I just wanted to clarify that Jen is truly only my husband's friend, not mine. We aren't \"couples friends\" with her and her husband. Jen and my husband were close as kids but haven't been close for years (before I ever came into the picture), sort of like a cousin you grew up with but only talk to at major holidays now. I don't hate Jen but we have very different world views so we likely won't ever be close. I'm sympathetic to Jen's loss as a person and as a person who has also experienced miscarriages. But I am not personally devastated by it if that makes sense. If my husband wrote the post the tone would have been different.  Given how long they've known each other and how she's so integrated into their family he felt it was appropriate to gift her a big ticket item which I thought was justified. I do wish he had waited to send it because I warned him that it was very early in her pregnancy and anything could happen.\n\nI will be logging out of this throwaway.

It was a mistake to buy a gift that early (I didn't get if she threw a shower or just sent the registry though). They still may try to have kids you don't know.

Jen and I aren't friends at all but we are friendly when we see each other. When Jen had her first kid my husband purchased a fairly expensive item off of her baby shower registry as a gift (around $200-$300 if I recall correctly). I had no issue with the gift or how much he spent, it was a nice item to gift her and we were excited for her to grow her family with her then boyfriend now husband.\n\nFast forward a few years, Jen and her husband are high earners (both making over 6 figures). Jen announced she was pregnant again very early along and sent my husband her baby shower registry with her announcement text which was full of high priced items. \n\nPersonally, I thought this was strange because she should still have most of the items from her first kid and I didn't think people usually did full blown baby showers/registries after their first. I was also surprised she was asking for gifts when she was still in the first trimester, but I'm a cautious person who didn't announce my pregnancy until 20 weeks which I know is extreme on the other side. I left it up to my husband what he wanted to do but mentioned to him that I was surprised she was organizing another shower/gifting event since she already has a young kid and got brand new stuff then. \n\nMy husband spent around $400 on a gift for her, fine with me. A few weeks later Jen had a traumatic miscarriage. I won't get into the details but she was devastated and the cause of the loss likely means she won't be able to carry future pregnancies to term. It's incredibly sad and while I'm not close with Jen my heart hurt for her. \n\nIt's been a few months since her loss and my husband is now unsure of how to navigate the gift. It's not something she can use for her older kid. Asking her to return the gift seems cruel, like adding a chore onto her grief, and it's probably past the return window anyway. I'm also not sure if she's going to keep trying to have more kids (very risky for the baby and herself) and it seems incredibly insensitive to ask, plus she may not have decided yet. Asking her to pay us back for it also seems very cruel. My husband and I are also decently high earners but $400 is still a lot of money. It's one thing if she's able to get a few years of use out of the item, that's money well spent. But if it's going to sit in a box in her attic for years....that's where we are getting stuck.\n\nSo, would we be TA if we asked about getting the gift back? Ideally we could get our money back somehow although it's probably too late. If we can't then I'd at least like to gift it to someone else who can use it (I feel awful just saying that but it's how I feel). However this is such a sensitive subject and we don't want to pressure her if she's not ready to discuss it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're being an AH even asking if you should ask for a gift back after someone's suffering & it's extra foul even if it weren't this kind of situation, which is all the worse. Don't give gifts to anyone if you feel like you may wind up asking for it back at a later date. You said you were fine with what your husband got but evidently you weren't okay with it. The both of you even considering asking for it back is beyond low. If you want to ruin the friendship, go on and ask for it back.

To answer your question, YWBTA 100% if you asked for it back.\n\nYour husband\u2019s friend went through something incredibly traumatic that is likely going to effect her mental and physical health for the rest of her life and you have the nerve to not only think about how much money you spent, but also consider it a waste of money because it\u2019s not being used in the way that you wanted it to be used. IT WAS A GIFT. Aside from the fact that, yes, she could potentially use the gift for another child if she decided to adopt or use a surrogate, even if she just wanted to keep it in the box and never use it, that is her right since it is hers. You decided to make the fiscally irresponsible choice to buy it, so that\u2019s on you.\n\nThe thing you need to seriously examine about yourself right now is your genuine lack of empathy. A mother lost her child. If you truly felt as bad for her as you claim, you would at least be to figure out what you could do to help her, even if it\u2019s just something small. When the tragedy first happened, I\u2019m sure everyone around her was jumping at the chance to support her, but this far down the road, she probably doesn\u2019t have nearly as much support. And you decide you want to contribute to her pain by rubbing salt in the wound.\n\nImagine how that conversation would go: \u201cHey, we know you suffered the loss of your child, but since you\u2019re not gonna be using that expensive gift we bought you, on account of losing your baby remember, we wanted it back so we could maybe get to pawn it off to someone whose willing to give us some of our money back or gift it to a mother who can ACTUALLY use it, cause you lost your child.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s awful.

There are many cheaper, much more useful things you can get a parent who is expecting, even if it is not on the registry. And remember this every time she makes a list and wants stuff. Any gift should be given with no expectation of the money or gift being returned. Any gift given should be given unconditionally. If you cannot afford to lose the money, don't spend it.

Doesn\u2019t matter if the wedding gets called off because someone cheated or because someone died - the marriage isn\u2019t happening  and any gifts given to the couple based on their pending marriage should be returned.", "The op is a monster and has a scewed moral compass and what a evil thing to ask a cupple to return your gift after they had a miscarriage. \n\nI hope op friend blocked and deleted op from there life .", "Right? I can\u2019t believe that any sane person would actually even consider this. All the justification is just noise - you are an asshole for even THINKING about asking for the gift to be returned. \n\nGod Almighty.", "Posts like this are honestly shocking to me. In what reality would someone even consider this to be a reasonable thing to do? 100% agree with your response. AH for even considering.", "Uh, a miscarriage is way different than a called-off wedding. She lost her baby and is likely in an intense stage of grief.\n\nNobody forced OP\u2019s husband to buy a gift. I\u2019ve gotten tacky requests for gifts for both showers and weddings, and I simply ignore them. It\u2019s very easy to do. And if you buy someone a gift for a baby shower and then the baby doesn\u2019t make it, chalk it up as a loss. Be glad all you\u2019re losing is money. If you want to avoid that risk, wait until the baby is born before purchasing something.", "On one hand I agree, on the other hand I don't. I feel like every child should be celebrated, not just the first one, so doing something like a diaper party instead of a \"baby shower\" is fully appropriate. More about a gathering of friends celebrating the baby, with the perks of diapers cause you're damn sure gonna use those and it's not an overly expensive or frivolous gift.\n\nI would also never blame a family for doing an actual baby shower if they are lower income. Many baby items get broken, trashed, overly worn..some get recalled or there are better/safer options out there as compared to oh so many years ago when baby number 1 came around. So asking for some newer items would be very helpful.\n\nBut that's not the case for this family. Asking for the higher priced newer items is a \"money grab\" of sorts. Rich people don't stay rich by spending all their money..and these kinds of rich people clearly are just looking to not have to spend their own cash for new baby stuff.\n\nThat said, OP would still be the asshole. Either herself for the idea of wanting to ask for a gift back in general, let alone from a grieving mother...or OP's husband for spending that kind of money without consulting her first. She claims it's \"fine\" but I don't think it was actually fine, especially if they share a joint account.", "OP keeps saying she was fine with what her husband did but obviously she isn't. \n\nBe honest with yourself and be honest with your husband OP.", "She goes to great pains and length to explain that the woman is not her friend, but her husband's friend. Sounds like she has some mean issues.", "You watched him sell it for drugs? Did you follow him around as he went and traded the umbrella for money and then drugs, or did he straight up trade it to a guy for drugs while you were standing there after giving him your umbrella? He didn\u2019t even wait for you to walk away? How long was the time between giving him the umbrella and him having drugs?\n\nThis is so bizarre.", "Correct!", "THIS! Would I expect a gift to be returned if the engagement failed or they divorced shortly after marrying? Maybe...but I would never ask for the item back. If the person LITERALLY DIED!!! Never in a million years would I expect ( or want ) the item back. I'd hope they use the gift reciept and use the money to buy something else they needed at that time or to help pay for funeral costs.\n\nBut especially with a miscarriage or an infant death? I'd be writing my deepest condolences and the gift ( as gifts should be ) would be written off as money I could clearly afford to lose in the first place.", "I look for clothes in the clearance area of TJ Maxx, personally. I can't afford to spend a huge amount on gifts and getting a clearance outfit allows me to add in a book or something else without breaking the budget. The prices get covered anyway, who cares what the cost is?", "Seriously, something is badly wrong with you.", "I\u2019m curious what this condition is that makes you so sure Jen will never carry a baby to term after one miscarriage? I know of several complications associated with preterm labor, and none of them are an immediate \u201cnever have kids again!\u201d They all have surgeries or treatments with pretty high success rates that one can try.", "I kept very little because I simply did not have space for it. I got almost everything back because the timing was right with the people I had given things to. But I was grateful for everything and certainly didn't expect anyone to give stuff back if they were using it. It would almost be like asking someone to give back a gift...", "It\u2019s funny how you\u2019re saying we when it\u2019s just you who wants the gift back", "Frequently yes. If you\u2019re going to a wedding where the ceremony and reception are happening at the same place, you\u2019re dropping your gift off before the wedding actually happens.", "It's important to OP. Not sure OP's hubby got the memo that *he wasn't supposed to spend $400 on f'ing Jen.* \n\nBut she's fine with it.", "When people ask what to get our toddler and baby- we always say books! By far the best gifts we get are books. We have family reading every night before bed where we all cuddle on the big bed and read my toddlers choice of books.", "Target gift card.\n\nThey'll get doubles and triples of lots of things or too many of one size and IDK if you buy coffee or diapers or baby butt cream or cooling spa masks. You're getting Target or Walmart gift cards. Something useful and you won't have to exchange it.\n\nSpend it when you need it, on what you need. Groceries. Clothes. Whatever you need. Idk. Go for it.", "Many registries let people team up or partially contribute toward expensive gifts, too. So the item might be hundreds of dollars but that doesn\u2019t mean you expect anyone to spend that much on their own.", "Yeah.  And she said they\u2019re high earners.  They\u2019re not feeling this gift financially,  she must really hate Jen.", "I wanted about a 2-3 year gap between mine. They're 2 years and 4.5 months apart. I did keep a lot of things, but some were just worn out, like the baby swing. My son loved it so much, and he used it well beyond when he probably should have stopped. He was still within the weight limit of the swing, but the motor wasn't doing so well. So, we got a new one for our daughter, who really didn't want anything to do with it. I sold it for $30, a fraction of what we paid for it, and it had been used 2 or 3 times. She just hated it. Kids, man. Smdh", "I feel like $400 for someone who is grieving isn't a waste anyway? It could go towards meals if they are struggling getting things done because of grief, or pay for a couple nights away to make space to deal with it all. OP, I would actually message her and say \"do whatever you want with it, we could return it and give you the money, or whatever you want.\"", "This is why people usually buy several different sizes for a baby shower. I always assumed most people do that. With my kid, I even got some 2t clothes. But I didn't get too many newborn sizes, which was great because he was a huge baby.", "Well thankfully I've only had to buy baby stuff maybe 3 times in my life, so this isn't something I need to put that much thought into. I get an outfit that'll fit when they're nearing a year old, a big thing of wipes, and then it'll depend on what else I can spend after that.", "That's because you realize that it's an incredibly insulting gesture.  Nothing says \"I love you\" like hoping her marriage fails, right?  I think I'd still take the money, though.  The insult was the gesture itself, and that that's not going to be undone by turning it down.  May as well make the most of the situation and relieve the asshole from some of their money.", "That makes no sense to me. Where am I going to store all that baby stuff for years? Or if the kids are too close in age (less than 2 or 3 years) the first baby is probably going to still be using their crib and other big items.\n\nIdk most people ive known dont have huge houses to store nurseries worth of stuff for years. We just donate the stuff to family, friends, or the community once the babies outgrow them, unless you have a definitive plan to have another baby.", "They call them baby sprinkles here.  Absolutely no registry, many people will bring diapers or wipes but there is no expectation for such.  It's just a lunch and games. There is a trend away from the first kid getting the fatten calf.", "Exactly what I thought when I first read that bit. A miscarriage and not being able to have another child are life altering events - and OP just assumes that their occurrence won\u2019t change Jen?", "u/Additional-Pickkk stole this comment from u/babsiegirl70. Downvote and report.", "If she went through with asking this and it got out she is going to ruin a lot of relationships. \n\nWhat kills me besides the obvious is that the return window is already past and they aren't even going to get their money back!", "Not to mention she very likely has ASTRONOMICAL medical bills if this miscarriage went down in a way that permanently affected her fertility. It\u2019s likely that gift 1.) either got returned or resold to cover those costs 2.) is sitting in with all the other shower gifts because Jen hasn\u2019t been able to go through them 3.) might get donated (along with other big ticket shower items) to the hospital Jen was at for moms in need or to a women\u2019s shelter or any other number of good causes.", "Everyone, I know always puts items at a large variety of price points on the registry.", "Yeah. Good call on the bigger size. They'll get so many teeny weeny baby outfits. Not useful when you have too many.\n\nI just go with like something small and a gift card. They'll have not gotten something they need.", "No, but to me you offer gift ideas when someone asks you what you\u2019d like. Not, \u201cHey I\u2019m having a baby. You can get me one of these items!\u201d\n\nAlso OP mentioned that the gifts on the list were high priced items. I would assume they have all the basics from baby #1.", "I had a full term loss. I did ask people who bought big ticket items if they wanted the item back. ALL said no. I donated everything to an expected mother in need. Why would you just jump to assume that they would sell the items for greed?", "Yeah we got 10% off some very expensive wedding china at a very high end boutique if it was not bought off the registry. So we registered for 2 sets and bought one. That 10% save me thousands", "If they were having a shower for a second kid, I assume they are greedy. Tacky AF.", "\"Hey can I have my wedding gift back since your fiance died and so you never actually had a wedding? \ud83e\udd2a\" \n\nI really don't understand how OP could think to ask this unless it's family, you became homeless and you know for a fact that the gift is going to sit there for forever  and that you actually would be able to get the money back. That's a tricky situation with no happy endings.\n\nI cannot for the life of me think why it is a tricky situation here. Next time don't buy so expensive and so early. Lesson learned.", "Ugh that sucks! I would want the gift back so I could return it too. I think the friend is an asshole for not proactively asking.", "Don\u2019t ask ever. At all.", "The weird part is that OP used the excuse for wanting her money back because it would sit in an attic unused\u2026 realistically (a total assumption) Jen would probably donate it.", "Eh if they\u2019re wealthy and so are all their friends then it\u2019s not weird. We live in affluent area and there\u2019s nothing more awkward than finding only a few cheap items left on the registry and having to pile them all together to reach a socially acceptable price point. I\u2019d rather buy the one big gift and have it delivered.", "Yeah, but if you had sent someone a wedding gift and then the groom died the next day, you wouldn\u2019t ask for it back\u2026", "Yep, I put the expensive things that we planned to buy ourselves on our registry. Also, the way Amazon worked, if a certain dollar amount was bought from the registry (I think it was $500), you would get a 20% discount on diapers for a year. So everything wet bought from Amazon, we added to the registry and then bought. New phone case? Put it on the registry then order it! But we made the goal and it really did help us save a lot on diapers.", "Right, hey since you no longer need that four slice toaster\u2026.", "Car seats expire? Wait what?", "If you are going to ask for it back, it's not a gift", "Also comes across as judging Jen every step of the way, judging her husband for buying the gift in the first place, and jumping on a tragedy to try to retroactively get the outcome she preferred. \n\nNow we\u2019re all feeling the same type of judgement for OP being tacky enough to write this post. \ud83d\ude43", "We haven\u2019t seen the registry so we don\u2019t know if op\u2019s husband picked a giant item that was one of only three or a registry full of expensive stuff.

It\u2019s not the bulk of what you typically ask for like bottles, that damn $20 bottle warmer nobody uses, onesies, diapers, etc\u2026 even if the registry was full of baby items from Nieman Marcus you don\u2019t have to purchase off the registry. Diapers are always welcome. It just sounds like sour grapes on op\u2019s part. The poor woman lost a child and the ability to have children in the future. The amount of pain and suffering she likely feels is immense and op is wondering about getting a gift back. How cruel.", "diapers always an option", "Haha we bought zero newborn clothes and got a ton of unworn ones from friends and family\u2026and my kids were too tall to ever fit in any of it so we passed it down too", "Poodles are awesome.

My daughter's roommate has one so we get poodle time.", "Yeah, my mom actually stored a bunch of my sisters\u2019 baby stuff after their kids grew out of them (she\u2019s very into keeping anything that might be remotely useful someday), but now that I\u2019m expecting, a surprising amount of it has been recalled or isn\u2019t recommended anymore.

Crib bumpers? Suffocation hazard. Drop side crib? Not even legal, and nobody will take them on donation, even. They go straight to the dump. That roller baby walker? Has literally killed and maimed babies. They have been straight up banned in Canada and pediatrician groups are trying to get them banned in the US and have major retailers stop selling them. #1 cause of accidental baby injuries in ERs. Really. Super dangerous. It's wild. Like 50% of babies who use them are injured in some way. Super sketchy.\n\nStationary jumper? Recalled. Some kid's finger got severed. Stoller? Recalled because it collapses when toddlers crawl under it or weight is under it and kids ended up with broken arms.\n\nSome of the stuff was just *wildly* dangerous.\n\nCheck hand me downs. Some is just straight up dangerous. Car seats have expiration dates and are soaked in bodily fluids, applesauce and general toddler and baby goop. They shouldn't be reused indefinitely.

It sucks but they've had to refund ten's of thousands of dollars worth of baby products to mother's/parent's who have lost their child due to a miscarriage, still birth or other reasons. It's heartbreaking but it's a part of reality. I'm going to say YWNBTA, however there's a right way and a wrong way to approach this. First DON'T just say can we have x back, that is an AH move. Remember she is grieving and having baby items would be a painful reminder. Instead you could approach this in a compassionate way and say that you're sorry for what happened and offer support. Some of that support could be in dealing with baby stuff if she doesn't want it anymore. I'm not saying take it for your own money back btw, just offer to help in whatever way **she** wants, so if she wants to donate them, give them back to the people who bought them or just toss them, respect her choice as they are now her property not those that gave them to her.", "YWBTA. My god. Can you imagine?\n\n\"Hey... I'm so sorry about the loss of your baby and fertility. But about that mamaroo...

It was a hard time. I subsequently went on to have 2 beautiful rainbow babies but yeah, that time has given me a different perspective.

The fact she cany be honest about it suggests that she cant talk openly with her husband about how much is appropriate to gift, or their relationship with Jen as a couple.", "She's clearly not as fine with it as she says, or she wouldn't be fantasizing about asking for it back. \n\nMaybe she didn't want to make a fuss as her husband and inlaws think this is a normal amount to gift, when it feels healthy high to her. Or maybe her husband sent the gifts before clearing the amount with her. But she evidently resents how much was spent.", "Omg the audacity of blatantly asking for gifts.", "It could have been money to help her start a new life?
