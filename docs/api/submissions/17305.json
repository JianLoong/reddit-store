{"id": 17305, "submission_id": "13idd74", "title": "WIBTA Asking our friend to return a baby shower gift after a miscarriage?", "selftext": "I know this sounds awful and I feel like it might be a terrible thing to do so I need some advice.\n\nMy husband has a long term family friend named Jen. Jen and I aren't friends at all but we are friendly when we see each other. When Jen had her first kid my husband purchased a fairly expensive item off of her baby shower registry as a gift (around $200-$300 if I recall correctly). I had no issue with the gift or how much he spent, it was a nice item to gift her and we were excited for her to grow her family with her then boyfriend now husband.\n\nFast forward a few years, Jen and her husband are high earners (both making over 6 figures). Jen announced she was pregnant again very early along and sent my husband her baby shower registry with her announcement text which was full of high priced items. \n\nPersonally, I thought this was strange because she should still have most of the items from her first kid and I didn't think people usually did full blown baby showers/registries after their first. I was also surprised she was asking for gifts when she was still in the first trimester, but I'm a cautious person who didn't announce my pregnancy until 20 weeks which I know is extreme on the other side. I left it up to my husband what he wanted to do but mentioned to him that I was surprised she was organizing another shower/gifting event since she already has a young kid and got brand new stuff then. \n\nMy husband spent around $400 on a gift for her, fine with me. A few weeks later Jen had a traumatic miscarriage. I won't get into the details but she was devastated and the cause of the loss likely means she won't be able to carry future pregnancies to term. It's incredibly sad and while I'm not close with Jen my heart hurt for her. \n\nIt's been a few months since her loss and my husband is now unsure of how to navigate the gift. It's not something she can use for her older kid. Asking her to return the gift seems cruel, like adding a chore onto her grief, and it's probably past the return window anyway. I'm also not sure if she's going to keep trying to have more kids (very risky for the baby and herself) and it seems incredibly insensitive to ask, plus she may not have decided yet. Asking her to pay us back for it also seems very cruel. My husband and I are also decently high earners but $400 is still a lot of money. It's one thing if she's able to get a few years of use out of the item, that's money well spent. But if it's going to sit in a box in her attic for years....that's where we are getting stuck.\n\nSo, would we be TA if we asked about getting the gift back? Ideally we could get our money back somehow although it's probably too late. If we can't then I'd at least like to gift it to someone else who can use it (I feel awful just saying that but it's how I feel). However this is such a sensitive subject and we don't want to pressure her if she's not ready to discuss it.\n\n\nUpdate: I appreciate the feedback I've gotten. We will not be asking Jen about the gift. We don't want to make her feel worse than she already is. Given her statements in the past regarding adoption I doubt she will find alternative ways to have another child if she is unable to do so biologically. But that's her path to walk. If she doesn't use it I hope she at least donates the item to someone who needs it. \n\nPeople have also commented on my tone and I just wanted to clarify that Jen is truly only my husband's friend, not mine. We aren't \"couples friends\" with her and her husband. Jen and my husband were close as kids but haven't been close for years (before I ever came into the picture), sort of like a cousin you grew up with but only talk to at major holidays now. I don't hate Jen but we have very different world views so we likely won't ever be close. I'm sympathetic to Jen's loss as a person and as a person who has also experienced miscarriages. But I am not personally devastated by it if that makes sense. If my husband wrote the post the tone would have been different.  Given how long they've known each other and how she's so integrated into their family he felt it was appropriate to gift her a big ticket item which I thought was justified. I do wish he had waited to send it because I warned him that it was very early in her pregnancy and anything could happen.\n\nI will be logging out of this throwaway.

Jen and I aren't friends at all but we are friendly when we see each other. When Jen had her first kid my husband purchased a fairly expensive item off of her baby shower registry as a gift (around $200-$300 if I recall correctly). I had no issue with the gift or how much he spent, it was a nice item to gift her and we were excited for her to grow her family with her then boyfriend now husband.\n\nFast forward a few years, Jen and her husband are high earners (both making over 6 figures). Jen announced she was pregnant again very early along and sent my husband her baby shower registry with her announcement text which was full of high priced items. \n\nPersonally, I thought this was strange because she should still have most of the items from her first kid and I didn't think people usually did full blown baby showers/registries after their first. I was also surprised she was asking for gifts when she was still in the first trimester, but I'm a cautious person who didn't announce my pregnancy until 20 weeks which I know is extreme on the other side. I left it up to my husband what he wanted to do but mentioned to him that I was surprised she was organizing another shower/gifting event since she already has a young kid and got brand new stuff then. \n\nMy husband spent around $400 on a gift for her, fine with me. A few weeks later Jen had a traumatic miscarriage. I won't get into the details but she was devastated and the cause of the loss likely means she won't be able to carry future pregnancies to term. It's incredibly sad and while I'm not close with Jen my heart hurt for her. \n\nIt's been a few months since her loss and my husband is now unsure of how to navigate the gift. It's not something she can use for her older kid. Asking her to return the gift seems cruel, like adding a chore onto her grief, and it's probably past the return window anyway. I'm also not sure if she's going to keep trying to have more kids (very risky for the baby and herself) and it seems incredibly insensitive to ask, plus she may not have decided yet. Asking her to pay us back for it also seems very cruel. My husband and I are also decently high earners but $400 is still a lot of money. It's one thing if she's able to get a few years of use out of the item, that's money well spent. But if it's going to sit in a box in her attic for years....that's where we are getting stuck.\n\nSo, would we be TA if we asked about getting the gift back? Ideally we could get our money back somehow although it's probably too late. If we can't then I'd at least like to gift it to someone else who can use it (I feel awful just saying that but it's how I feel). However this is such a sensitive subject and we don't want to pressure her if she's not ready to discuss it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're being an AH even asking if you should ask for a gift back after someone's suffering & it's extra foul even if it weren't this kind of situation, which is all the worse. Don't give gifts to anyone if you feel like you may wind up asking for it back at a later date. You said you were fine with what your husband got but evidently you weren't okay with it. The both of you even considering asking for it back is beyond low. If you want to ruin the friendship, go on and ask for it back.

To answer your question, YWBTA 100% if you asked for it back.\n\nYour husband\u2019s friend went through something incredibly traumatic that is likely going to effect her mental and physical health for the rest of her life and you have the nerve to not only think about how much money you spent, but also consider it a waste of money because it\u2019s not being used in the way that you wanted it to be used. IT WAS A GIFT. Aside from the fact that, yes, she could potentially use the gift for another child if she decided to adopt or use a surrogate, even if she just wanted to keep it in the box and never use it, that is her right since it is hers. You decided to make the fiscally irresponsible choice to buy it, so that\u2019s on you.\n\nThe thing you need to seriously examine about yourself right now is your genuine lack of empathy. A mother lost her child. If you truly felt as bad for her as you claim, you would at least be to figure out what you could do to help her, even if it\u2019s just something small. When the tragedy first happened, I\u2019m sure everyone around her was jumping at the chance to support her, but this far down the road, she probably doesn\u2019t have nearly as much support. And you decide you want to contribute to her pain by rubbing salt in the wound.\n\nImagine how that conversation would go: \u201cHey, we know you suffered the loss of your child, but since you\u2019re not gonna be using that expensive gift we bought you, on account of losing your baby remember, we wanted it back so we could maybe get to pawn it off to someone whose willing to give us some of our money back or gift it to a mother who can ACTUALLY use it, cause you lost your child.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s awful.

There are many cheaper, much more useful things you can get a parent who is expecting, even if it is not on the registry. And remember this every time she makes a list and wants stuff. Any gift should be given with no expectation of the money or gift being returned. Any gift given should be given unconditionally. If you cannot afford to lose the money, don't spend it.

She lost her child and the ability to carry a pregnancy to full term- that\u2019s a lot to process.\n\nAlso you don\u2019t ask for a gift back no matter the circumstances. That\u2019s tacky as hell. You should\u2019ve waited to send the gift until much later- that was the decision your husband made.\n\nLet it go, bringing it up now serves no purpose than to make you both look like callous AHs.", "YTA", "First, who has a baby shower for their 2nd kid? I mean really?  But you would be an AH to ask for the gift back. Think about it this way:  1. It would be extremely awkward conversation to ask for the gift back. I wouldn't want to ask even if someone paid me $400 dollars to do it. 2. It is not financially devastating for you, it sucks and I am sure there are more fun ways (and less fun ways) to lose $400 but thats life. 3. Is $400 worth the potential strain on your marriage?", "You shouldn\u2019t have given a $400 gift if you couldn\u2019t afford it. This is a lesson you and your husband are learning the hard way, \nDo not ask for a gift back. You\u2019ll burn a lot of bridges, and rightfully so. Don\u2019t ever tell anyone that you considered it, because it\u2019s such a terrible thing to even think about doing it will cast you in a really bad light.", "YWBTA, but I also understand where you're coming from. If you're worried about the use, consider reaching out and letting her know that you're OK with her re-gifting it, donating it, or even asking her to return it so you can do something \"nice\" for her and her husband. Or just send them the gift receipt so they can do whatever. \n\nA gift is a gift even if it doesn't get used in the intended way. If you couldn't afford to spend $400, you should not have allowed your husband to do so in the first place. I appreciate your edit and update, but letting them know it wouldn't insult you for them to do something else with it (after giving them time and space) would be fine, imo.", "OP, if your husband had a fatal car crash, how would you like people coming to ask for their gift back as he wont need them anymore \\^\\^ It's not a question of how close you are to this person, it's just basic human decency. And it's so wild I hope it's a fake...", "YTA , and on a massive scale. Don't give a gift if the gift is conditional. It could be that the hope that they will conceive again is what is keeping Jen and her husband going right now, so they have those gifts stashed. Or maybe choosing to donate those gifts gives her some small comfort that a needy person can benefit from her loss. Either way, its her business.", "YTA. Who asks for a gift back, regardless of the circumstances?!", "Don\u2019t give gifts unless you can afford to give them and want to, regardless of the recipient\u2019s financial state. \n\nAsk for the gift back and you\u2019ll never have to get anything for this couple or see them again.", "Yeah she said that her husband spent $400 which she was fine with\u2026so it\u2019s not like they seem strapped for cash or anything", "They shouldn't have given such an expensive gift if they couldn't really afford it. But it would be so tacky to ask for it back.", "I am glad she asked here before moving forward with this idea.  That would be very insensitive and callous to ask for the gift back or money for it.   Instead, they could ask Jen if there is anything they can do for her.", "I disagree with this, some gifts ARE \u2018conditional\u2019.  You give a couple a wedding gift, and they break up before it happens, you should get the gift back.  You give a gift for a baby, and IT never happens, the gifts should be returned.", "Agreed. OP understands that asking for the gift/money back is cruel, so why have they been mulling over this for months. It was also a gift. Once a gift is given, it's gone. It is no longer the concern of the gift giver.\n\nThis is on par with asking for wedding gifts to be returned if the bride or groom passes away.... You just don't.\n\nThere is also a lot of judgement for Jen in this post......", "Especially if they're well off. If they were just scraping by it might be different (in which case they shouldn't have bought such an expensive gift)", "Also it seems like OP's husband bought the gift way earlier than he needed to and had it sent to Jen instead of waiting until she had her baby shower. That's on them (him).", "Can you imagine going up to someone who just had a miscarriage that possibly cost them their fertility and asking for your gift back \u201cbecause it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be using it anyway, lolz.\u201d \nThe absolute cringe.", "I've been to tons of baby showers and never heard of someone returning gifts from one. Whenever someone has lost their baby, I've never once thought about whether or not I'd get the gift I gave them returned.", "This^^^ or some items like convertible beds are in use by the in older child", "Its not really tacky? It sounds like they all are rich and probably get a lot from other rich friends so they make a registry to not get the same stuff 10 times.  My aunt comes from a rich family and friend network. She got over 15 huge bears lol with her first child. Aftewards she made a list and yea it was filled with stuff that was 500-1000$ but thats normal in circles where people earn a few 100k a year.", "Everyone I have known had a babyshower for every baby. To me it's weird that some people think it is weird..", "The woman is suffering and the only thing you're worried about is that someone can use the gift? That is so effing weird. None of this is literally any of your business. She can donate it when and if she wants to. I can't even imagine doing this to someone I hate. Like why would you potentially ruin relationships and hurt her further over this?", "So is this a miscarriage or still born most people have showers at minimum 20 weeks plus. Which would mean she fully had to deliver her dead baby. Like thats the equivalent of getting a gift for her kid that's about to turn one and died and ask for it back.", ">Yes I have had multiple miscarriages actually\n\nUgh, now anyone questions you on this will be an AH...\n\nWell played though.", "Typically, people aren\u2019t holding their hands out for gifts in the first trimester. A shower is generally held with 4-6 weeks to go.  \n\nI don\u2019t think OP should ask because I agree it\u2019s rude.  But a gift is unopened and unused, yes it should be returned to sender.", "It's not technically an obligation, that's true, but when the recipient sends around a registry and stocks it with only pricey items, then there isn't much choice if you intend to give a gift. Thoughtful registries provide a range of price points to accommodate guests at different income levels. Lower-cost goods aren't necessarily undesirable or poor quality. Sometimes you have to spring for the expensive option, but sometimes the expensive option is marked up for no reason other than branding. \n\nI would never ask for the gift back. I feel second-hand embarrassment just thinking about it. But I think if I were in that position of receiving a gift for a life event that will no longer be taking place, I'd contact people asking if they'd like the gift back or if they want me to donate it. Not initially. Grief and recovery time are needed. But eventually I would do that.", "If you\u2019re talking about tact, it\u2019s relevant. Any baby shower after your first should be a \u201csprinkle,\u201d not a shower. It\u2019s not about whether or not they have money in regards gifts being given for the first shower. But 2nd, 3rd, etc. showers with big gift registries are not really appropriate. Future \u201csprinkles\u201d are supposed to be about low cost gifts and a celebration, not a greedy gift grab.", "Yeah, my ex-wife had one for our first child, but not our for our second one 2 years later.  \n\nBut when she got pregnant with our third child 5 years after that she had a shower.", "It's not weird, it just looks like you're cashing in on your pregnancy and being greedy.", "She wasn't the one who spent the money on the gift. Her husband bought the  gift. Out of his own account. But she has decided to try and get back.  \nIf her husband has the issue then he could try and discuss it.", "You re being stupid, of course you keep expensive item", "A gift once given is no longer yours. Of course you cannot ask for a refund. Did you know that there are other ways to enrich your family besides your own children? Perhaps one day they will try to adopt her.", "Took too long to find this comment", "The gift has been given. It no longer is a thing you have any right to, including asking for it back. What the recipient does with it is none of your goddamn business.\n\nIf you have someone else you'd like to give it to, then buy another one. If I were that person and found out you'd taken it back from a person who'd lost their baby  I would cut you out of my life for the monster that you are.", "The givers shouldn\u2019t ask, but yes, the other half of the couple should return gifts.", "Can you cite which etiquette says that it includes miscarriages? Emily Post never would said that. I think you can make exceptions when extremely painful traumatic events occur."]}
