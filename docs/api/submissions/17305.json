Jen and I aren't friends at all but we are friendly when we see each other. When Jen had her first kid my husband purchased a fairly expensive item off of her baby shower registry as a gift (around $200-$300 if I recall correctly). I had no issue with the gift or how much he spent, it was a nice item to gift her and we were excited for her to grow her family with her then boyfriend now husband.\n\nFast forward a few years, Jen and her husband are high earners (both making over 6 figures). Jen announced she was pregnant again very early along and sent my husband her baby shower registry with her announcement text which was full of high priced items. \n\nPersonally, I thought this was strange because she should still have most of the items from her first kid and I didn't think people usually did full blown baby showers/registries after their first. I was also surprised she was asking for gifts when she was still in the first trimester, but I'm a cautious person who didn't announce my pregnancy until 20 weeks which I know is extreme on the other side. I left it up to my husband what he wanted to do but mentioned to him that I was surprised she was organizing another shower/gifting event since she already has a young kid and got brand new stuff then. \n\nMy husband spent around $400 on a gift for her, fine with me. A few weeks later Jen had a traumatic miscarriage. I won't get into the details but she was devastated and the cause of the loss likely means she won't be able to carry future pregnancies to term. It's incredibly sad and while I'm not close with Jen my heart hurt for her. \n\nIt's been a few months since her loss and my husband is now unsure of how to navigate the gift. It's not something she can use for her older kid. Asking her to return the gift seems cruel, like adding a chore onto her grief, and it's probably past the return window anyway. I'm also not sure if she's going to keep trying to have more kids (very risky for the baby and herself) and it seems incredibly insensitive to ask, plus she may not have decided yet. Asking her to pay us back for it also seems very cruel. My husband and I are also decently high earners but $400 is still a lot of money. It's one thing if she's able to get a few years of use out of the item, that's money well spent. But if it's going to sit in a box in her attic for years....that's where we are getting stuck.\n\nSo, would we be TA if we asked about getting the gift back? Ideally we could get our money back somehow although it's probably too late. If we can't then I'd at least like to gift it to someone else who can use it (I feel awful just saying that but it's how I feel). However this is such a sensitive subject and we don't want to pressure her if she's not ready to discuss it.", "created_utc": 1684169360, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13idd74/wibta_asking_our_friend_to_return_a_baby_shower/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a husband problem", "YWBTA. It\u2019s very clear from what you wrote that you judge this woman for having a registry for a second kid and for announcing her pregnancy when she did.

I suggest that you stop buying gifts for people that you don't care about. Once you give a gift, it doesn't belong to you. Divorce, miscarriage, etc happen, don't ever count on getting a gift back.", "I think YWBTA. It was a mistake to buy a gift that early (I didn't get if she threw a shower or just sent the registry though). They still may try to have kids you don't know. It would be a low blow to ask to be reimbursed.\n\nMaybe if you have them over dinner, and in the conversation they say they won't have anymore babies, you can ask them what they're gonna do with the gifs they received.

That money is gone, you shouldn't even be thinking of the possibility of getting it back. It is not up to you to police whether the recipient will use the gift (or use it enough for you to consider it worthy of the cost). If you couldn't afford this, then you shouldn't have done it. If you were not ok with spending that amount despite being able to afford it, then you shouldn't have done it. Now it's too late. \n\nIt doesn't matter what Jen does with the item.

By asking for it back you are saying to Jenn we don\u2019t care if you\u2019ve had a miscarriage, return the gift. She\u2019s experiencing grief and You\u2019re concerned with the gift. You said your heart hurts for her but your actions make it seem like you have zero empathy.", "YWBTA. Imagine it is your friend, what if your best friend had a miscarriage like this and you gave her that $400 gift, would you ask for it back? Or would you realize it\u2019s incredibly cruel and let her keep it. Of course you would. Because what\u2019s $400 compared to hurting your friend while she\u2019s already hurting. It\u2019s time to ask yourself about what boundaries you want between y\u2019all because from the sounds of this post, you don\u2019t seem to like Jen. The title alone made me gasp because I wondered how someone could be so insensitive. You know it is awful, you opened with that. But somehow you still felt the need to ask ask if you had any sort of justification for this, which begs the question, why? What part of this scenario gives enough reasoning to do something so cruel? I mean I wouldn\u2019t even do that to an acquaintance. The only reasoning that I could have to do something so cruel is if I did not like the person. You don\u2019t like her. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not okay to take a baby gift back after a miscarriage. It is okay to tell your husband to not spend so much money on something you don\u2019t agree with spending so much money on, like Jen.", "YWBTA. You have no say over a gift once it\u2019s given. It is poor etiquette to ask for a gift to be returned. Not just that, but you would definitely add to Jen\u2019s trauma by asking her to return the gift.", "Yes you would be the asshole. YTA because you\u2019re aware and still asking. You let your husband choose the value of the gift without your input so you can\u2019t complain about it now. You\u2019re assuming she won\u2019t have anymore children (how privy to her medical info are you? There could be options like IVF or they may pursue adoption or fostering). It\u2019s too late to return the item.

And she is absolutely hurting. \n\nAnd just a quote that often goes around on Reddit - once you give a gift, you don\u2019t get to decide how it\u2019s used.

You'd ABSOLUTELY be the asshole if you did. I know $400 is a lot of money but it's also nothing compared to the pain your friend is going through right now.

A few weeks later Jen had a traumatic miscarriage. I won't get into the details but she was devastated and the cause of the loss likely means she won't be able to carry future pregnancies to term. It's incredibly sad and while I'm not close with Jen my heart hurt for her. \n\nIt's been a few months since her loss and my husband is now unsure of how to navigate the gift. It's not something she can use for her older kid. Asking her to return the gift seems cruel, like adding a chore onto her grief, and it's probably past the return window anyway. I'm also not sure if she's going to keep trying to have more kids (very risky for the baby and herself) and it seems incredibly insensitive to ask, plus she may not have decided yet. Asking her to pay us back for it also seems very cruel. My husband and I are also decently high earners but $400 is still a lot of money. It's one thing if she's able to get a few years of use out of the item, that's money well spent. But if it's going to sit in a box in her attic for years....that's where we are getting stuck.\n\nSo, would we be TA if we asked about getting the gift back? Ideally we could get our money back somehow although it's probably too late. If we can't then I'd at least like to gift it to someone else who can use it (I feel awful just saying that but it's how I feel). However this is such a sensitive subject and we don't want to pressure her if she's not ready to discuss it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To answer your question, YWBTA 100% if you asked for it back.\n\nYour husband\u2019s friend went through something incredibly traumatic that is likely going to effect her mental and physical health for the rest of her life and you have the nerve to not only think about how much money you spent, but also consider it a waste of money because it\u2019s not being used in the way that you wanted it to be used. IT WAS A GIFT. Aside from the fact that, yes, she could potentially use the gift for another child if she decided to adopt or use a surrogate, even if she just wanted to keep it in the box and never use it, that is her right since it is hers.

When the tragedy first happened, I\u2019m sure everyone around her was jumping at the chance to support her, but this far down the road, she probably doesn\u2019t have nearly as much support.

There are many cheaper, much more useful things you can get a parent who is expecting, even if it is not on the registry. And remember this every time she makes a list and wants stuff. Any gift should be given with no expectation of the money or gift being returned. Any gift given should be given unconditionally. If you cannot afford to lose the money, don't spend it.
