Also she really shouldn\u2019t lie to her husband either.", "NTA. She could have given you a heads up.", "NTA You should not be required to keep track of other people\u2019s lies", "NTA. You can't be expected to keep a secret if you did not know it was a secret.", "NTA. It's okay to tell others but not her husband? Makes me wonder what else she's hiding.", "Nta you didnt know it was a secret!!!", "It wasn't a secret", "Your friend is a liar and a poor planner.  This isn't a winning combination. NTA", "NTA \nI have heard of cases where people have had work done and then have kids that don\u2019t look how their partner would\u2019ve thought and it becomes a whole thing. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had kids with you/been with you if I had known this is what you looked like before, etc\u201d.

So once again. How were you supposed to know? She told you she tells new people she meets so again how were you to know that her own husband didn't know ..lol maybe she shouldn't have lied ans told you that only people in that circle know about it. Just weird. And the old photos...... what did she think was going to happen. Especially if it's visually apparent.?!

I am pretty curious what she had done. Nose?", "NTA\n\nIf I were him, I'd be wondering what else has she lied about?", "NTA. She didn\u2019t swear you to secrecy nor ever even implied that you should.", "Yes that what I thought too like we never had a discussion of it being a secret most of it were like how she is open about it and makes sure she wants everyone to know so she\u2019d get their opinions on PS", "Maybe that's the real secret?", "I'm a year younger than OP but call me old fashioned. I feel like you can't expose someone if that \"dirty secret\" is well known by everyone around them...", "Look I personally dc if she tells him or not I think she could\u2019ve gave me heads up and I would\u2019ve been careful. This actually the first time she lies about it.", "Exactly! And how can you be a terrible secret keeper if you don\u2019t know that that particular piece of information is a secret?", "Right? Like can you imagine marrying someone thinking they are beautiful and have great genetics that your future kids are going to inherit, and it turns out it was plastic surgery? Don't get me wrong, I have *nothing* against plastic surgery and people should do whatever they want with their bodies. But I just think it's something you would tell your spouse.... It's a lie by omission.", "I, too would like to know.", "Idk but some people just forget about it some people know about it and still go \u201cyou look different\u201d I don\u2019t remember him sounding surprise actually it cane to me as everyone else said it before. His surprise appeared after my answer.", "Nonsense. It would be completely normal to say that in a surprised voice even if he knew his wife had work done. Further, considering that her friend was so open with everyone else, there was no reason for OP to think anything of it. NTA at all, and OP's friend is for expecting OP to read her mind.", "No it kinda sucks that your partner isn\u2019t honest with you about themselves like it is the number 1 rule to be honest. It even sucks more when he believes I knew about it while he didn\u2019t.", "To her it never been catty she always told me about how she wouldn\u2019t shy away from it.", "It is not the first time someone says that and not first time I am the one who answers what cue?", "You\u2019re not a terrible secret-keeper; she\u2019s a bad liar and a bad person.", "She might not think so but that anger she has for you is her angry at her self for lying to her husband.\n\nHow are you to know not to say anything \n\nNot a very good or true friend to act like that and toss a friendship", "Exactly. Like I said, she could have warned you but she didn't. She's to blame, not you. \n\nIt's always easier to point fingers at other people instead of yourself.", "Agreed! Very well said!", "I don\u2019t think it makes her a bad person. Just terribly insecure", "having ps doesn\u2019t make her a bad person, or insecure. lying to her spouse and blowing up on a friend when they don\u2019t read her mind and play cloak and dagger with the person she\u2019s supposed to share her life with makes her a bad person. nta."]}
