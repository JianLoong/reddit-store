Could you try to compromise with your wife, and limit clapping along to once per evening, or even just once per week? Since she doesn't have any habits that drive you bonkers which you could negotiate with, could you strike a bargain by doing something extra nice to make up for the annoyance? \n\nAlso, as a fellow fan of clapping, may I recommend Adam O'Dell's arrangement of the Friends theme that morphs into Steve Reich's \"[Clapping Music](https://youtu.be/H95F2UTHhxE)\"?

OP is trying to understand why it bothers her so much- I understand not needing a \"valid\" reason to be annoyed by something, but shutting down the conversation and getting mad at OP for it is not a mature way to handle it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this needs to be a sit down conversation between OP and wife about boundaries and pet peeves.

If this is the biggest issue in their relationship I say it\u2019s alright to just avoid dealing with this issue. Alternatively maybe take turns clapping and not clapping every other episode?

Do you repeat every sound on tv?\n\nAre you perhaps 3 parrots in a trenchcoat?\n\nBut seriously, please don't ridicule this. I'm assuming it's misophonia, and we know it's not logical, but some sounds just are enraging. For some people it's snoring, for some it's sudden clapping noises, etcetera. Ofcourse in most situations we learn to deal, but I'd think you'd want your wife to not feel on edge when wanting some fun, relaxing times with her husband.", "You're being condescending with this comment and your attitude towards you're wife's pet peeve. Why are some people afraid of any spiders (even the small ones)? Some things like fears are irks are not logical.", "Why do you need to clap to the Friends theme song?\n\nDo you also bark when you hear a dog bark?", "What does it matter? There are some people who find turtlenecks unbearable like they feel choked. Some people hearing chewing noises can send them into a rage. I personally have a phobia of roaches where if I see one I will be shaking and crying. Does it make sense.. no but my husband runs to smack the everliving shit out of it instead of pushing a roach in my face saying it\u2019s so small! Why are you scared for? Like you would probably enjoying doing. \n\nWhy do you choose to die on this hill. You have the right to clap just like she has the right to walk away.", "She is an asshole for being that dramatic. I'm Autistic with misophonia - his mouth noise makes my brain hurt - I suck it up because I'm an adult and I don't control other people.", "Let's hope so.", "Saying \"I appreciate your perspective\" is the same as not commenting at all. It adds no new info to the post, and is completely meaningless.", "Then she should use her big girl words and tell him if she has noise sensitivity.", "I can see the compromise of not doing it every time, or doing it more quietly, but I don't get why her dislike trumps his joy. There will always be mild irritations between loved ones, but I'm a firm believer in not yucking on someone's yum unnecessarily. Like my partner is a terrible singer - no pitch, no rhythm or anything, whereas I'm a trained singer. I wouldn't dream of telling him to stop singing along to his favourite music, even if it's off-key or out of time, because it makes him happy!", "If he's clapping several times quickly- presumably while being near her- I'm thinking that it might also be loud or startling. \n\nFor a while my partner had a habit of reading jokes on his phone and laughing really, really loudly, to the point where it felt like I couldn't sit next to him without getting a headache. I didn't want him to stop laughing at things but it got easier when I communicated that I'm sensitive to loud noises and he started dialing it back a bit when we're together.", "Reminds me of raising hope when burt barks at the dog when the dog barks. His logic is something like it's because the dog is barking so he (burt) should barking too. Virginia tells him dogs barking, humans don't, the dog is just doing what he does.", "It shows the op is taking in criticism at least. Plus if we're gonna brand any comment they make with downvotes we might not get more context later on if they become scared to comment", "No it doesn't. It's a complete non-answer. It's the same thing you say at work when someone is droning on and on and you just don't feel like arguing lol"]}
