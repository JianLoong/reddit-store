If this is the biggest issue in their relationship I say it\u2019s alright to just avoid dealing with this issue. Alternatively maybe take turns clapping and not clapping every other episode?

He would have the tv on, or we would all watch as a family, but when I was little (I'm talking 5-8 probably), I really did not like the interactive red button that was shown on screens. When I was those ages too interactive TV and these red button add ons were popular so some channels had big, bold, and bright red buttons that couldn't be ignored. But worry not! A simple press of the 'back up' button on the remote removed the lightly inconvenient button distraction. \n\nSo I asked if he could press backup to remove the red button, and he said no. I, as a child, asked again stating it isnt being used. He again, said no, and almost laughed as he asked why. I said it is distracting to the TV show. He wouldnt do it. He would not simply move his finger for 3 seconds to press the button. He wasn't using the features. Even if you remove the red button, the features are still there, just the essentiall button advertisement is not. Not that he ever used it. He purposefully left it there to distress me (obviously an isolated incident would not lead me to this conclusion, multiple surrounding events over years did). He said no for the sake of saying no. It had no affect on him but it did on me. \n\nWhat was once a very minor inconvenience/annoyance to me, followed me into adulthood as a majorly distressing issue. Should he had removed the button, or given a reason, I highly doubt I would remember this incident or have an issue about this topic. Luckily now I am an adult, the adults I choose to surround myself with are not narcissistic bullies who ignore or enjoy distress of others.\n\nPetty of me to feel this strongly about a red button? Absolutely, yes. But did somebody else in my past cause a completely unnecessary trauma surrounding this? Yes.

This is healthy.  \n\nGetting upset with your partner for clapping is not setting boundaries.  It is an attempt at controlling their behavior because you think the behavior is silly.  This is not healthy.", "... Doesn't everyone do that? My husband and I even have different parts \ud83e\udd23", "WWEEEE OOOO OOOOOOOOOOO", "Because it\u2019s not like she\u2019s asking him to stop doing something like watch TV entirely, or reading books at all, or going out with his friends. She\u2019s asking him to please stop making four clapping noises that irritate her. \n\nWhy does he insist on having to do it? Why does he \u201cenjoy\u201d doing it so much that he has to do it even though it bothers her? Yeah, it might be a dumb issue to be bothered by but i\u2019m looking at this from the perspective of is HE the asshole because he\u2019s the one who asked. \n\nIf she was here asking I\u2019d be asking if it bothers her because it\u2019s loud/a sensory issue, or if it\u2019s because she asked him to quit and he didn\u2019t so she is now pushing the issue. Is there other stuff she\u2019s asked him to stop doing and this is just the last in a long line of things he feels annoyed about being asked to stop doing that makes him happy? We don\u2019t know, these posts are never an accurate picture of both sides", "Yeah nothing ruins a song for me like listening to someone else sing over it. It's like if I was trying to watch a movie and people were standing in front of the screen acting out all the scenes.", "Interesting! The more you know...", "Yeah but the husband liking something is just as valid as his wife not liking something. They really need to figure this out because it's a petty issue. But simply \"not doing something you like because I don't like it\" is not valid in itself.", "I think that depending of the post and the context, I'd probably do a dialogue too. Sounds simpler than writing \"then I said X, then she said Y\". English I'd not my first language tho", "Totally agree. Exact quotes are a big tip off to me. Who remembers exactly who said what?", "Are they taking it in though?  Because it came across to me as passive aggressive.  Sort of like the non-apology \"I'm sorry you feel that way.\"  This seems to be OP's modus operandi.", "It's just a general observation. There just seem to be a lot of people who have perfect memory of every word in a conversation, so it comes across as suspicious. Especially when the other person says totally irrational things, and OP sounds calm and logical.", "Especially if it's like:\n\n\"Something totally irrational!\"\n\n\"A calm and logical response.\"\n\n\"NOW I'M YELLING IN ALL CAPS!\"\n\n\"Completely reasonable comeback.\"\n\n\"STILL ALL CAPS!\"\n\n\"Calm and measured burn.\"\n\nAnd then everyone clapped.", "That's the problem -assuming there's more to it than her being petty.", "Then she can leave during that part. The issue is hers. He enjoys it, there arent enough joyful little things. Instead of him refraining due to her annoyance, she should see the joy it brings him and get over herself.", "If she is having that much of a reaction over harmless little hand clapping I think she doesn't like him very much. That ordinarily wouldn't bother anyone including me. She just doesn't like him anymore. I don't know the fix to that.", "Except he finds it fun. He gets enjoyment from it. \n\nIt's not that it does nothing for him - he enjoys it. \n\nI have a relative with misophonia. I feel it, understand it, respect it. But we are forever altering OUR behaviors around it. We can't take a sip of water on the phone. We can't eat in the same room. We can't clear our throats. Her kids can't do this or that. I understand that it's real. I understand that it produces real feelings.   \n\n\nBut at what point does it ever become the person's responsibility to find coping mechanisms and not everyone around them?", "This sounds less like \u201cI remember every word\u201d and instead like \u201cI\u2019m paraphrasing from my POV\u201d so I think it\u2019s not that OP remembers the exact conversation but that he\u2019s telling what he remembers with his perspective on it (hence why he sounds calm and logical and why partner sounds irrational) \n\nNot arguing that this might be fake though, I genuinely don\u2019t know", "I am not genuinely upset. \nI understand what you're saying and that works sometimes but not always. But my question is if there's a small meaningless thing you do and someone repeatedly asks you to stop, why can't you stop for them? Assuming you care.", ">me: you are being an ahole and overreacting\n\nIt's right there in the OP. I'm not debating the words in front of me, sorry. \n\nAlso, aren't you speculating about the length of the discussion? Don't remember that in the OP.", "Well the clapping takes a little over a second. Have you heard the Friends song? The discussion he describes definitely took several seconds. Read it out loud and compare to the clapping in the song."]}
