It\u2019s under management, but it won\u2019t get better and absolutely won\u2019t be completely cured. I made peace with that long ago, it doesn\u2019t bother me mentally (physically that\u2019s a different story though).\n\nI\u2019m friends with my ex (F18), who recently invited me to her wedding. We\u2019re friends since middle school and parted ways back in high school, so no hard feelings. Her mom, I\u2019ll call her Jen (F53), for some reason was always obsessed with my condition in that weird morbid curiosity way, constantly asked whether I\u2019m feeling well, what\u2019s the prognosis, what the doctor said, offered some weird natural remedies/alternative cures or whatever it\u2019s called. I never really made a big deal out of it, mostly just said \u201cI\u2019m okay thanks\u201d out of politeness and changed the topic.\n\nSo fast forward to the wedding, it went smoothly, but it had a free bar and by the middle of the reception most of the guests were noticeably drunk. I didn\u2019t drink much bc the meds I\u2019m on don\u2019t interfere with the alcohol in a good way, but I was somewhat tipsy as well.\n\nObviously, Jen, who was already drunk to the point she had issues standing, approached me and started questioning me about my illness. I tried to maintain the polite tone and said \u201cI\u2019m okay don\u2019t worry\u201d as usual, but she kept pushing for more info. \n\nSo, here\u2019s where I might be the AH. I guess I just lost it since it\u2019s not exactly the most pleasant topic to talk about during a wedding, plus I was tipsy as I said, not that it excuses my behaviour, but I guess it explains it. I snapped and told her that no, I\u2019m in fact not okay, my internal organs are slowly failing and I won\u2019t make it past 50, and no, no goddamn home remedies would magically cure me or else I\u2019d be healthy and thriving. Of course she got upset and started crying, saying that she doesn\u2019t want me to die and loves me and wishes I\u2019d be there instead of the groom (WTF bitch). I tried to comfort her, but no avail. Needless to say it started some drama, I\u2019d spare you the details since I left shortly after it all started and basically spent the whole night comforting the crying bride and eventually drove her home while risking getting a DUI in the process.\n\nNext morning her mom texted me saying that I\u2019m an AH, that I ruined the wedding by starting the drama and possibly damaging the newlyweds\u2019 relationship. She said that I upset her and I had to be positive and hopeful and even proceeded to say that god cursed me with my illness (WTF bitch x2) and that if I used her natural remedies I\u2019d be healthy.\n\nI personally don\u2019t think that I\u2019m the AH, yeah I could\u2019ve handled it better, but the second option won\u2019t hurt.", "created_utc": 1698664178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jqx6l/aita_for_ruining_the_wedding_by_upsetting_the/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However well-intentioned people mean to be, it's incredibly upsetting to be continually asked prying questions, given incorrect and inappropriate advice and made responsible for everyone's response. It is hard enough to have a health condition like this. You do not need to carry the weight of everyone else's reactions to your illness as well. I always say. 'I don't talk my condition with anyone but my doctors, let's talk about something else.' And if they don't respect that, just walk away.
