It\u2019s about someone\u2019s brother purposely scheduling a party on the OP\u2019s birthday causing his own parents to not attend his birthday party. They\u2019re all pretty clearly adults and his disappointment isn\u2019t borne out of immaturity.\n\nSo you\u2019re asking an irrelevant question about the OP\u2019s age while also making weird implications that OP being upset his own brother knowingly double booked and refused to reschedule when his gf asked him to is immature.", "If you cant accept that downvotes dont necessarily make any sense, then this is not the sub for you. \n\nAnd tbh from the comments below it sounds like these downvotes did make some sense.

It depends on the context, one factor is the OP's age.\n\n> They\u2019re all pretty clearly adults \n\nI honestly don't know that nor do I know how much of an adult the OP is (so 18 years old is an \"adult\" but is, to me, could be different level of maturity).  Asking for clarification should not be a negative thing.  I mean, just answer it (even an age range) and move on.  Don't ask for pre-justification to vet things out.", "Yes. You do know that. Your downvotes are well earned bud!", "I found it pretty incredible that a mod created the first mega asshole award for some 20 year old kid who suggested his gf didn\u2019t pay her parents back for her tuition. I mean, sure, he\u2019s an Asshole, but given the level of assholery you\u2019ve seen, this is the first time the Mega Asshole award is given?

And they were sometimes made up on the spot. [Tomato ass mfer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/8s56a3/aita_for_throwing_a_soda_on_the_ground_near_the/) is a classic. This was also before the judgment acronyms were formalized. That\u2019s something that evolved with the ability to automate the flair.\n\nThat stuff is really fun to do too.", "Yeah. Lady who sold her boyfriend/fiancee's project car to the junkyard illegally was just a regular old asshole, while asshole 20 year old does asshole 20 year old things gets special bullying courtesy of the mod?", "Downvotes are against the sub rules so really, when someone downvotes, they are themselves TA.  I wouldn\u2019t take the opinions of assholes personally because, well, they\u2019re assholes.", "Hahahaha! The tomato ass mfer sent me! fun facts indeed. thanks for sharing!", "Your equivocation is incredibly poor.\n\n\"Why does my son hate me -> I beat him but that doesn't matter\" is an absurdism, while it hardly matters what age someone is when their birthday is effectively usurped."]}
