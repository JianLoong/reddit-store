I was stunned & didn\u2019t really know what to do, & didn\u2019t want to cause a scene. I hugged her, excused myself, and that was that. The next day I was speaking with my sister about the incident & she told me to read thru my texts from that day.

They made the decision and that was that. ( I will note that they were not involved with any of the wedding. They had made it clear from the beginning that they did not want to be involved) I replied back that I was hurt by their behavior, that they did not have the right to do that, & that they were incredibly rude to my husband & I.

I sent the text to my aunt telling her the rule was in place for a reason, that we did not have the capacity for kids, & that her behavior to my guests was unacceptable. I went so far to ask her if there was something going on and that I hoped that she was alright. My younger sister sided with my parents, and we haven\u2019t spoken since.

Then the aunt finds out truly what consequences are.", "Same with parents and sister", "Oh yes, please do this!!\n\nYour family are TA's here!\n\nGo live your best life with your man and skip the drama that is your family!", "I like you.", "This is passive aggressive perfection.", "\"matters because if she's not inviting a 17 year old under the guise of it being a \"childfree wedding\"\n\nI would think that would make OP the ahole. At that point you are purposely not inviting one/some individuals of the household. Absent that person doing something bad to you inviting one person and not another is ahole behavior. \n\nThat would be like inviting family members but not inviting their spouses to keep numbers down. We are inviting aunts Jane, Anna,  and Susan but not their spouse, we invite uncle Bob, Jim, jack but not their spouses. \n\nOP didn't really have a no children rule, she had a \"no people under 18? Rule\"\n\nGenerally the no kids/children rule is about kids/children getting bored and being noisy at the wedding/reception.", "Calling her out tells her aunt that she will not tolerate her behavior. It also leaves no room for misunderstanding when the aunt doesn't get invited to any more events.", "My dad and step mom. This had caused drama amongst my family (my parents trying to play both my sisters against me, my older sister of course not falling for it) and I originally agreed because I wanted to keep the peace, but clearly I shouldn\u2019t have.", "People are children well into their teens. In most countries (AFAIK) they're legally so until they're 18.", "#1 - NTA\n\n#2 - you need to go further than this. Multiple family members betrayed your trust, and your action is to send a text? You didn\u2019t even kick them out at your own wedding \n\n#3 - you share this publicly with everyone you know so the entire family can find out how much your parents and aunt DO NOT RESPECT YOU. Then you tell them that unless you hear sincere apologies from all, it\u2019s the last time you will be talking or seeing them again. Seriously. They are walking all over you and your marriage and you\u2019re letting them", "YTA, I feel really sorry for your new husband that you\u2019re putting emotion and effort (even taking the time to write this) into this big nothing burger. You had a teenage wedding crasher who didn\u2019t cause any trouble. In the grand scheme of what can go wrong at a wedding, this was nothing. You should have dropped, not discussed it, and filed it away in the back of your mind that you can\u2019t trust that aunt in the future.", "Nope NTA if your parents don\u2019t pay for the wedding, they don\u2019t get a say it\u2019s not about them it\u2019s about you and that\u2019s all there is to it.", "You are the only non asshole in a family full of them it seems.\n\nNTA", "No not you. But you seem to come from a long line of A Holes!  All of them, their wants and whims are way more important than yours you see. Some people elope to avoid this kind of bullshit drama.", "Not the a hole.. you set a boundary and people cleaned to come and disrespect you. You will find peace by removing people from your life. My mom came to my wedding snd was rude to my wife and I haven\u2019t spoken to her since. Cut her off along with my brother for their toxic behaviour", "Honestly I can see it both ways. I wouldn't want the aunt's kid to feel bad because if she aunt is like this then I'm sure the poor kid is already embarrassed and probably wanted to go. But I do agree you're nta they shouldn't have went behind your back. I'm sorry this happened at least you guys had a good wedding otherwise. Don't let it ruin your big day.", "NTA by far. Don't ever put your aunt & cousin in a position to do this again. Permanently uninvited.   The father...whatever.  You have your own family now. Time to back off these", "They were all dead wrong, but let it go. You are newly married and the intent was to make u unhappy in your new space.  Don\u2019t bring that BS into your new marriage.  The best revenge is living your best life.", "NTA! Wow! Your parents are horrible!!! Your aunt is the same!! They all disrespected you. I would go NC and wouldn\u2019t feel bad about it.", "No they did not pay for it. We paid for it ourselves with help from my in laws", "I\u2019d made a decision to not let anything get to me that day. There was a lot of other family drama & in the scale of things this was minor. I didn\u2019t know the baby was there until we were doing the rounds of the tables to speak with our guests so it didn\u2019t really impact me. \n\nBut, I\u2019ve always found that cousin spoilt, rude & unfriendly. So I just never bothered with her again. She\u2019s the type who would never say hello or ask how you are. So after that I just never bothered with her, so we\u2019ve been at parties etc together, I never said a word to her & she to me. Once we were literally the only people in the room & she still didn\u2019t say a word to me! \n\nDoesn\u2019t bother me, she\u2019s dull as fuck so it\u2019s a relief! But I know she\u2019s complained to her mum about it, but I\u2019m just treating her as she treats me. If she spoke I\u2019d respond! \n\nAt one party I was having a laugh with one of the other cousins & I felt someone looking at me. I looked up & she was full on GLARING at me, & didn\u2019t break eye contact when I looked up. I held her gaze for a moment & just laughed! She\u2019s so odd! It\u2019s lovely not bothering with arseholes & concentrating on the people you like, it\u2019s so freeing!", "Not at their own wedding. Who is their right mind would want that?", "Yes. Why do you ask?", "l disagree", "l disagree", "Ugh.  Okay, then they had no say in who could attend.  But the wedding is over, it\u2019s said and done now.  You can choose to focus on moving forward and embracing your marriage, or you can choose your hang onto the grievances you have regarding your rude and entitled aunt and family.  I suggest you move on, focus on your family, which is your husband.  Don\u2019t let their shitty behavior ruin things your you.  Start making a list o& everything that was good and enjoyable about your wedding, the people, the moments that were good.  Ad anytime you think about the negative things whip out that list and replace those negatives with the good stuff.  Really focus on those moments.  Don\u2019t let them have anymore of your time thinking on their shitty selves.", "This is the way!", "LUV IT!!!!!", "Or else the family could ignore her boundaries again.", "This would be a wonderful way to get the message across. Family should support and help you, not demean and irritate you. NTA, I'm honestly astounded you even had to ask.", "My parents were once invited to a wedding with a \"no children\" rule and I was excluded when I was 19(still living at home/in college). But no one threw a tantrum or tried to bring me anyway. They didn't have enough space or funds, so only people listed on the envelope were invited. This isn't hard", "Is she your dad's sister?"]}
