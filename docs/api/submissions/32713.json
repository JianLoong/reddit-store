Leading up to our wedding we had no issues.  The wedding was pretty laid back, not many guidelines, the only significant one being no children unless they were in the wedding (1 flower girl, 2 jr bridesmaids, 1 ring bearer). I knew that my aunt didn\u2019t like this rule from the beginning. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t like kids, we simply did not have the capacity for them. Fast forward to the wedding day. Things were going really well & I was speaking with some other guests when my aunt comes up to me with her teenage daughter and announces that she brought her anyways, & that she didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. I was stunned & didn\u2019t really know what to do, & didn\u2019t want to cause a scene. I hugged her, excused myself, and that was that. The next day I was speaking with my sister about the incident & she told me to read thru my texts from that day. My MOH had my phone for most of the day, but my sister had warned me that this was going to happen & that this had been the plan the entire time. She wanted her daughter there & she was going to sneak her in behind my back. On top of that, I had also found out that my aunt had been rude to many of my guests; ignoring them when they said hi, or straight glaring at them.  I decided I was not going to let this go & was going to text my aunt about her behavior. I texted my father & step mother letting them know I was going to be messaging my aunt about her behavior at my wedding & was just giving them a heads up because drama spreads thru my family like wild fire. I honestly thought they would ignore the text & go on with their lives like they normally do, but instead they became incredibly rude. Apparently they had told her it was ok to bring her regardless of my wishes. I was told I was being overly emotional, I was overreacting & that they were well within their right to do so. They made the decision and that was that. ( I will note that they were not involved with any of the wedding. They had made it clear from the beginning that they did not want to be involved) I replied back that I was hurt by their behavior, that they did not have the right to do that, & that they were incredibly rude to my husband & I. I told them I would be sending a message to my aunt anyways & that was that. They did not like this. I sent the text to my aunt telling her the rule was in place for a reason, that we did not have the capacity for kids, & that her behavior to my guests was unacceptable. I went so far to ask her if there was something going on and that I hoped that she was alright. My younger sister sided with my parents, and we haven\u2019t spoken since. I know it has spread around my family that I was disrespectful for not inviting my cousin to begin with and for sticking up for myself to my parents and aunt. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702172126, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18esh4v/aita_for_calling_my_family_out_for_going_behind/", "score": 695, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The tables were all round & she insisted that everyone at her table scooch round so they could pull the high chair into the table (no need for this). So everyone moved their chairs, but couldn\u2019t move place settings so were sat uncomfortably on top of each other eating their dinners sideways.
