He was saying it a bunch of times. This worried me though because we have a cousin (9M) who actually is adopted, but I don\u2019t know if his parents have told him. He wasn\u2019t there when this happened thankfully, but him and his parents were invited that day and would soon arrive, so I was worried that this kid would still be making adoption jokes in front of him. \n\nI then took my cousin aside and told him not to joke about adoption like it\u2019s a bad thing, and when he asked why I explained that our cousin is adopted but I\u2019m not sure if he knows, so he shouldn\u2019t bring it up either way. I explicitly told him that he shouldn\u2019t say anything about it, in case he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s adopted.

Bad move! He may have shared it on social media within the hour.\n\nAnd the issue shouldn't be that another adopted kid might hear it; it's that there's nothing shameful about being adopted, yet your only concern is that an adopted kid you knew might overhear. But it's his statement that's wrong, period.\n\nAnd your mother is 100% right; it's not your job to tell the kid. It's the parents' job. Don't butt in where you're not wanted.\n\nYou blew it; YTA.\n\nEdit to add: you need to own up to this and inform the adopted kid's parents that you told his cousin he's adopted.", "My entire family knew one cousin was adopted. Even his siblings knew. \n\nBy the time he found out he was furious that not only was he lied to, but that he was the last to know. \n\nYta for bringing a child into this secret when he already showed how disrespectful he is", "YTA\n\nLet the adopted child's parents know.", "YTA because the chances of a 12 year old being aware enough to not blurt out \"hey did you know you're adopted\" to his 9y old cousin is virtually zero. \n\n>I also think that if he doesn\u2019t know, eventually he\u2019ll find out anyway but that\u2019s beside the point. \n\nThis is also not for you to decide, and definitely does not make it ok; how he finds out is between him and his parents.", "YTA a 12 yo who is already behaving inappropriately is not mature enough to carry an important secret that impacts his younger cousin\u2019s life. You should have spoken to the 9 yo\u2019s parents first. They could have intervened in the 12 yo\u2019s behavior if necessary.", "YTA. As she said, it wasn't your place to say anything. You could have told him not to make that joke without telling him a family secret.", "YTA. There\u2019s no way this kid will keep his mouth shut. It would have been very easy to have a conversation with your cousin without revealing this information.", "I think you\u2019re dumb as a bag of rocks. \u201cLet me tell the immature kid ammo sized information\u201d fucking think before you act my dude.", "YTA but also the 9yo's parents are TA too for hiding the fact that he's adopted. He will find out and he will resent his parents for it. I adopted my daughter and my wife and I have never tried to hide it or even dance around it.", "YTA. Do you really think that a 12yr old, making \"you're adopted\" jokes, would actually keep the secret of a younger cousin being adopted? \n\n\nAs an adult, you just needed to say it wasn't appropriate and not make those jokes anymore. End of story. Instead, you gave a pre-teen ammo.", "YTA\nThat was not your secret to share.  You don\u2019t know that a 12 year old is going to have the judgment to keep his mouth shut. \n\nIn fact, all indications point to that he won\u2019t have good judgment given his teasing the other kids about this very issue.", "Eh, this is a weird one. YTA but with good intentions yet terrible execution. It's as simple as that with this information, that your cousin is adopted, you don't have authority to bring up, even if you're aware or have good intentions. It's one thing for telling your cousin that your other cousin is adopted with good intentions, but who's to say that this information won't spread? Even if your cousin isn't aware he's adopted, the whole point of that is for the parents to eventually break it to him, why should anyone else know let alone share that information on the side? Again, YTA but with good intentions, it wasn't your information to tell.", "There's a good chance that the edgy kid will make fun of the adopted kid because he's adopted.

I know you had good intent, but sorry, YTA.", "Yta that was not your decision to make, you should have asked 9ms parents. You need to learn that first thought isn\u2019t the best thought and you should have group sources and appropriate response. Because trusting a 12 year old is not a smart decision also it isn\u2019t fair to give a big secret like that to a 12 year old. At that age I would have a hard time processing the best thing to do because I would want to know if I was adopted and I might think 9m would want to know as well. Or if he gets into a fight with him it might slip out because he\u2019s only 12. \n\nGo to 9ms parents and explain what you did and how to fix it.", "YTA, because that kid you told is highly likely to actually say something. \ud83e\udd26 It wasn\u2019t their business, in any case.", "Yta.  This is when you should had gone to 12m\u2019s parents and you tell them what he is saying and they deal with it.", "The people who I know who were adopted knew of the adoption from a young age.  It wasn't a secret.\n\nI think you did the right thing by talking to your 12 yr old cousin to say that it wasn't funny, but maybe bringing your other cousin in as an example was a little bit of over sharing.\n\nIt is a very soft YTA", "YTA", "Soft YTA. Your intentions were good but execution was not. You could have educated him on why what he was saying was insensitive, without using the 9 yo as the example", "NAH I think your intentions were fine and as long as the 12 y/o doesn\u2019t say anything it\u2019s fine. If the little cousin does know, it could definitely hurt their feelings to hear him making fun of adoption.", "YTA. You seem sure that the 12yo wouldn\u2019t tell the 9yo to hurt him, and I\u2019ll accept that. But the 12yo is also demonstrating bad judgement around what\u2019s funny and is trying to be edgy, and you just gave him more information to accidentally mess with.\n\nI suggest you find a way of ensuring that the 9yo\u2019s parents know that the information is starting to be known by some of the kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I knew from a young age that I was adopted (since I was about 4 probably) so I grew up knowing it wasn\u2019t shameful and as an adopted person I will always think keeping it a secret from the adopted child when everyone else know is the biggest A-holey thing to do", "YTA learn to mind your own fucking business\n\nIn your stupid haste to show just how more grown up you are than a 12yo - tawwwwwww - you showed your gross lack of maturity", "Not your business.

Do his family a favour, call them and let them know what you did so that if their son doesn't know yet that he's adopted, they may want to tell him before someone else does. That was very thoughtless on your part. You could have talked to him without letting him know about your adopted cousin. Let's hope you haven\u2019t opened a can of worms here.

It's like telling any other personal information about somebody else.\n\nYour 12 year old cousin should not have been telling jokes about adoption in this vein because they're inappropriate - not because you personally have an adopted family member. What would you do if he was telling jokes about people from a different religion or ethnic group than your family? Or about LGBTQ people and, to your knowledge, nobody in the gathering is LGBTQ? You wouldn't say \"Well, nobody hearing this can be offended, it isn't about them\" and walk away, would you?\n\nWhat you would say in that situation is that these jokes are inappropriate, no matter who you think is listening.

Many adopted kids (I am one, and have been to many support groups, also studied this in when I did social work in university) go through trauma their whole lives related to abandonment, identity and belonging, and it\u2019s widely agreed by both professionals and adoptees that being smacked in the face with that later is far worse than explaining adoption in an age appropriate way from early childhood and getting the adoptee resources to manage those feelings of belonging, identity issues, and abandonment.", "THIS is the best answer!", "Yeah, this whole family situation is bizarre. Adoption shouldn\u2019t be a secret - it shouldn\u2019t be a secret from the kid, nor is it something the parents should be treating as a secret from members of the family, like it\u2019s something to be ashamed of. If the parents haven\u2019t told their kid, they\u2019re assholes, and if they have, it\u2019s so weird that it would still be this much of a taboo subject in the family. OP was the asshole here but the whole family dynamic sounds just weird."]}
