You're still having a baby. That baby will still need all the things in that nursery. Maybe this is a good chance for you to reconsider your attitudes to sex and gender - because, spoiler alert, the baby doesn't care what colour their clothes and blankets are.", "ESH \n\nI cannot imagine why she thought it would be less painful for you to think you were having a boy and then disappoint you later. Getting your hopes up accomplishes nothing.\n\nThat said\u2026you very much did overreact in clearing out the nursery and disinviting her mother from coming over. This reaction is crazy and you talking about this pain and devestation surrounding having a girl is probably the reason she was afraid to tell you. Because she probably wants to be excited about this child and didn\u2019t want to deal with you acting like it\u2019s something devestating that it\u2019s a girl. \n\nAlso, you are projecting wayyyy too much on an unborn child. What if you did have a boy, but he wasn\u2019t as interested in this intense father-son relationship that you are craving? Can any real life father-son relationship actually even live up to the one in your head that is supposed to heal your past wounds? \n\nYour kids are real people, don\u2019t set them up for failure by having all these weird expectations for how they will better your existing traumas.", "INFO: be very honest. How would you have reacted if she told you it was a girl up front?", "ESH. Your wife allowed you to develop a bond with a child who doesn't exist. Asshole and just really stupid. How long did she think she was going to protect your feelings for? But you seem to have an extreme preference for a boy, not to mention some pretty unrealistic expectations about what a baby can do for you, which makes you a bit of an asshole yourself.", "ESH / YTA ~~I N F O~~\n\nWould you have been angry / upset if she had told you right away? I feel there is some missing information.\n\nYou reacted violently when the truth was revealed.\n\nShe lied, that is bad.\n\nEdit - I still think the OP is the bigger asshole.", "ESH\n\nShe\u2019s really cocked up there. Not sure what she was thinking\u2026 and don\u2019t know why she played the long game on this (why didn\u2019t she argue for gender neutral at least!).   You were going to be devastated one day or another.  But packing up the nursery is counter productive, and your MIL will be at a range of baby related events, or your wife might wonder why she\u2019s married to you. You can be as hurt or angry as you are\u2026 but you aren\u2019t going to win with that one at all, it will create life long rifts in the family. Does she deserve your trust? Hell no! But you are in a difficult situation here, so go for the one that keeps your marriage intact.  (Edit, because skim reading skipped a paragraph changed my vote)\n\nWhich leads me to my second comment... a baby isn\u2019t a chance for you relive, replay, rewrite or re script the things you didn\u2019t have in your own childhood. This baby will be an individual in their own right, please don\u2019t place too much pressure on yourself or them. Instead please love them for who they are, not what they might represent or repair of your past.", "ESH, your wife\u2019s lies were bad, however your reaction and words show that you would have reacted otherwise if you knew it would be a girl. Please seeek therapy and resolve your issues, your daughter does not deserve potentially being loved less than a baby boy.", "ESH\nShe shouldn't have lied, but you shouldn't be so focused on having a boy. You can be a strong male role model to your *daughter*\u2014if you can put aside the bias. It sounds like you want a re-do\u2014like raising a son would be like your father raising you\u2014but that doesn't work. Your child won't be you and you won't be your father, and doing things \"right\" with a son won't change how things transpired. Have a strong relationship with your child, no matter their gender.", "ESH. She lied not cool and I\u2019m not sure how you come back from that but you care that much about the gender and not just hey I want a healthy baby\u2026.. WTH. You can have a close bond with your child if you put in the effort but you have to not care about the gender. I\u2019m a girl and I was my dads best friend and his shadow growing up. He taught me how to fix cars, lawn mowers, clocks how to drive a huge stick shift tractor, ride horses. Gender doesn\u2019t matter the opportunity to teach and grow is there if you take the chance.", "ESH.\n\nHer and her mum for lieing.  You for over reacting.\n\nBut you do know you can apologise, and raise a badass girl instead, right?", "ESH. You are putting a lot of emotional weight on your pregnant wife about your unborn child.\n\nTry some therapy.\n\nNot sure what she was hoping to accomplish, as the truth would have eventually come out. \n\nTry to be a better husband.", "Children aren\u2019t emotional support animals. I\u2019m guessing your wife lied because she was scared of your reaction and also wanted to save HER feelings because she knew you\u2019d become a huge bummer once you found out. You need therapy immediately to deal with your issue. ANY healthy baby that is delivered earth-side is a miracle- no matter the gender. My husband and I have tried for the past 7 years to get pregnant and I\u2019ve had 5 miscarriages. Remember just how lucky you are that your wife is pregnant and (assumably) carrying a healthy child. YTA.", "ESH your wife for lying, you for the overreaction. A girl can wear blue land you\u2019re going to \u201cban\u201d her mother bc your wife lied wtf??? This reaction and your comments clearly showing how overly invested you are to having a boy is probably what made her worried.", "ESH. Your wife shouldn't have lied to you; finding out later has got to be harder. You clearing out the nursery and banning MIL is a rotten reaction.\n\nListen, my Mom had a very difficult childhood with abusive parents and difficult relationships with her siblings. She REALLY wanted a boy because her and her sisters got along terribly and she was terrified she'd have trouble getting along with a daughter. Back then the doctors were stupid and refused to tell her the gender so they did the nursery in gender neutral colors (yellow and greens). Low and behold, I'm her only child and I'm a girl. My Mom and I are best friends and always have been. \n\nThe relationships you have as a child, with siblings or parents, has no bearing on what your relationship with your child will be. Gender doesn't and shouldn't matter for either of you. You want to be a great parent... then BE one. I work with kids and have seen girls who are closer to their mother and girls who are closer to their father just as I've seen boys closer to their father and boys closer to their mother. How this goes between you and your kid is up to you now. Don't let the past ruin the present or the future for you and your kid.", "I was on your side until I read comments about how you'd have been a little sad to have a girl. Gross. YTA for creating an environment that made your wife lie to avoid dealing with your reaction", "ESH. If you continue this attitude, your daughter's childhood will be just like yours - without father figure. Your wife is AH for hiding the truth, but you are following her asshollery pretty close.", "ESH lying about the gender was obviously a stupid choice but \"I would have been sad but I would have come to terms after some time\" is a horrible reaction to a gender reveal. I feel really sad for this little girl. Also throwing out the nursery when you will have a child anyway is just dumb. Also What if your next child is a boy? Even if you say now you would treat them equal you by no means will. Seek counseling, also as a couple. You need to do waaayyy better than this in order to raise a child", "ESH but honestly you sound REALLY unstable: You are not going to get your trauma healed by a child?! You\u2019re actually at risk of really screwing up a boy by expecting that the wound from your lack of a decent father figure will be healed by having someone entirely dependent upon you. Also, you can\u2019t just say you really don\u2019t want a girl as much and then say that that\u2019s not problematic because it\u2019s rooted in a bad childhood. Nope, you\u2019re about to not be a decent father to your daughter. You need to be ready to accept a child of any gender if you want to be a parent. I hope you\u2019re going to grow up and redo the nursery FYI, girls can sleep in blue rooms\u2026 I\u2019m a woman and my childhood bedroom was blue and I still collect Disney Mattel dolls as a hobby! Blue doesn\u2019t make your kid a boy or even masculine presenting!\n\nYour wife and MIL were ridiculous, though you overreacted. The lie is (unintentionally) cruel and hurtful but looking at your reaction\u2026 you can see why she was probably literally scared (not for safety but for your relationship) to tell you the truth. You\u2019ve not been able to attend any appointments with her, ok maybe it\u2019s clashed with work but the way you\u2019ve expressed this here is by sounding like you\u2019re a victim of this too and heroic for working. You seem to feel the fates consipire against you - it\u2019s scary to let someone down when they present like that. You\u2019re also giving your trauma as justification for a lot, again, it\u2019s hard to let down a traumatised person even if you can\u2019t avoid it. So, you\u2019re wife has been dealing with all the realities of pregnancy without you and she tried to avoid a huge, anguished confrontation when you came back, by lying. Selfish and stupid but I see why she did it, she bought herself some time.\n\nYou now need to deal with your feelings and get some decent, intensive therapy (individually and couple\u2019s counselling). You really need to apologise to MIL, this may be controversial but in attending appointments she was basically doing something which should be your job and she was just trying to support her own daughter. Also, info (for you to consider as well as us): What would you have said at first if you knew it was a girl? Because it sounds like you\u2019d be incredibly disappointed. You need to rid yourself of expectations before the baby arrives and for the rest of the pregnancy or you\u2019ll be wanting mother and baby to take responsibility for your trauma by providing you with a catharsis that will never come. You\u2019ll move past childhood issues by working on yourself, not by projecting your trauma onto an unborn child.", "So if you have another child, are you going to prefer the son over your daughter?", "Info: why did you clear out the nursery? Does the baby no longer need a place to stay? My guy wtf?", "YTA - your wife shouldn't have lied, but your reaction was so wildly inappropriate and completely proves her fear right. You packed up the nursery and basically screamed to the world that a *girl* child is valueless, not worth preparing for or being excited about. \n\nI feel bad for your wife, and worse for your daughter.", "Info - whats missing here \n\nYoud find our eventually sooo\u2026 yeah there\u2019s something missing here.", "This was not saving your feelings, it was stringing you along. So now instead of being excited for a daughter, they\u2019ve managed to make the daughter announcement a let down. I\u2019d be pissed too", "YTA\n\nThe presence of that child will not paper over the gaping wounds of your childhood.\n\nplease go to therapy so you don\u2019t inflict your childhood trauma on your child(ren)", "NTA. I don\u2019t care if you would\u2019ve been initially disappointed about having a girl, you invested time, money and energy into making that nursery for who you thought was your little boy. It\u2019s not the fact it\u2019s a girl, it\u2019s the fact she lied to you.", "ESH. Obviously lying is shitty, but you\u2019re way worse imo for not questioning your preference for a boy and reacting so strongly. Honestly, if you\u2019re still so attached to this idea of having a boy because of your childhood, you might benefit from talking to a therapist.", "NTA, I have known people in similar situations to you craving a strong female or male bond in their lives, so I can empathize with the sentiment.\n\nYour wife and her mom were way off base lying about the gender. That is about as bad as lying about a pregnancy in general. especially given that she knew how you felt. \n\nI think a long conversation needs to be had with your wife.

She shouldn't have lied, but go watch some videos on the Internet of gender reveal parties and you'll see the looks of utter disappointment on the faces of the father to be when he discovers it's going to be a girl. There's a lot of misogyny buried in there and the poor girl is going to grow up with a father who resents her because of her gender.

What does that actually do for anyone? Definitely does not provide any benefit whatsoever.  Definitely not normal.. is that what she will teach this child??\n\nJust wanted to add that you can definitely have a strong relationship with a daughter!! You know there is a term like daddys girl! Gender  does not define a relationship! Take her fishing, hiking, play catch in the yard, teach her how to change a tire or check oil in the car, have tea parties with her and her dolls, play dress up, barbies, etc etc whatever you feel you missed out on\u2026 just build her up with all different hobbies, experiences, to be independent, etc.. \n\nGood luck!", "ESH\n\nGod damn daddy issues are wild.

Your wife was mentally and emotionally manipulating you in a cruel and inhuman way.\n\nTime to get into therapy. Time to take a step back from the relationship - not the child - and get your head around her behavior.\n\nNTA but there's a whole lot more here to unpack. I do NOT recommend couples counseling with someone who is mentally manipulative. Individual therapy.", "Esh. go to therapy.", "NTA. This may be going against what most say, but IMO, this has much less to do with whether you're having a boy or a girl than it does about being lied to and deceived. You're a grown man, and your wife and MIL treated you as if you were emotionally immature and incapable of being a father to your own child, whether boy or girl. Sorry, OP. \n\nIF my husband had somehow lied to me as your wife did to you, I would have been devastated. First, because I felt sad about not having a boy. But more importantly because of how cruel it was to be lied to.", "While I firmly hold that you should be prepared to love any gender of child equally, I honestly don\u2019t see that you weren\u2019t prepared to do that from the start.\n\nIf your wife and her mother for some weird reason hadn\u2019t decided to lie and deceive you it\u2019s more than likely you would have been just as thrilled with having a daughter. \n\nThey let you build up a specific dream for no reason and then expect you to just not react to it? \n\nNope. \n\nExcluding your mil from interacting with your child I can actually understand as who would trust anyone who was fine and comfortable lying to your face about your child with said child?  I sure wouldn\u2019t be. Obviously you can\u2019t stop your wife the same way.\n\nAs for packing up the nursery, the child you build it for never existed and so metaphorically died for you. Just like a miscarriage you loved them but never got to hold them. That your daughter will need a nursery isn\u2019t the point here, she will get one obviously but not the one you made for her sibling that never was. This is about emotions not logic. \n\nNTA. They Never should have lied.", "So to protect your feelings she lied to you and led you on for months... Even seeing you paint the room blue? Did she ever intend to tell you? I don't know how you could stay with somebody like this after she purposely stabbed you in the back and twisted the knife for months! \n\nYou're NTA but you have a big problem with your wife. What she did was downright cruel. Finding out you were having a girl would have been slightly disappointing, but it wouldn't have been a big deal. Instead she dangled this boy in front of you like a carrot then snatched it away... Why? Does she enjoy your suffering? Because she caused a lot of it unnecessarily! I don't know how you can continue to be with somebody so cruel. I can't even imagine how she's going to treat children.", "NTA. I (37f) became unexpectedly pregnant 4 years ago. I never thought I would have the opportunity to be a mom, but I always knew that if it did happen, I would be a better boy mom than a girl mom. I was thrilled to finally have the chance to be a mom at all, and I knew that regardless of the child\u2019s gender, I would love them unconditionally. I was just extra thrilled when I found out I would be having a boy. I think it\u2019s sweet that you want to have a strong paternal bond with your child, just realize that both genders need that in their lives. Your wife, on the other hand, is fucking nuts about lying about something so important. If she was so concerned about revealing the sex to you, her husband and the father of this unborn child, she never should have found out and the two of you could have gone into the whole thing together not knowing what to expect. Instead, she allowed you to decorate for a traditional boys room. Her mother is just as complicit in this game. I think your actions were rash but understandable when you consider they both knew how important gender was for you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d love a baby girl any less (most dads will tell you that the moment they set eyes on the baby they were gone, hook, line, and sinker [apparently my own father told my mom I was better than a puppy lol]), , but now is the time for you to start rebuilding your trust and relationship with your wife and her mother in order to provide your sweet, innocent baby girl the loving family she deserves. Change the paint to a beautiful sky with clouds, green at the bottom, and wildflower appliqu\u00e9s. Put the furniture back in, switch from Dino\u2019s to unicorns.

Your wife shouldn\u2019t have lied to you, but if she were telling the story from her perspective I would imagine her reasoning would be that you were completely against having anything other than a boy and she was scared that you would react angrily and not accept the baby if you knew she was a girl.\n\nTrue story, I overheard a guy in in a restaurant once telling his wife while pointing to a father being affectionate with his sons, how gay the behaviour is, the wife visibly upset pointed out that there\u2019s nothing gay about a parent showing affection to their child and the guy retorted something along the lines of, well he thinks it\u2019s gay and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so glad they had girls because he could never show affection to a boy and would get angry and not be able to control himself instead of feeling like consoling a boy if they were to cry and probably be cold and distant with them otherwise because he knew he would be like his father was with him growing up and that he could only be a good girl dad. \n\nThe wife looked completely mortified at this point like it was the moment she realised how much she regretted having any children at all with a man that reasons like this and they were both quiet throughout the rest of the dinner.

I unfortunately believe that that story and yours are in a similar vein, where your expectations are not only unrealistic and skew but somewhat selfish. Because children are not an extension of us or an opportunity to heal our own inner child and past traumas. It\u2019s very unfair to place such a heavy idealistic expectation on a child before they\u2019re even born and not their burden to carry.  Even more so to place it on a factor outside of their or your own control like gender. The guy in the story probably isn\u2019t a very good dad to girls either or alternatively isn\u2019t giving himself the credit of the possibility that he would love a boy just the same.

(She was not one of the special education students, but there was a special ed teacher in the class who didn't only concentrate on the special ed students, they would also help out with the \"regular\" students.) Never in those ten years did I ever hear even a whisper of a suggestion that I might want to get her tested. Not just for autism, she also has ADD and GAD. I noticed and got her tested. I'm just a mom--a very well educated mom, but still, a mom who doesn't have any background in education.

I wish I had been more on top of this myself, but I even more wish her teachers had done their job and didn't ignore her becasue she was quiet, polite, well behaved and while her grades weren't good, she didn't start flunking classes until 8th grade.

Now they've re-done it as 115, but I'm convinced it's still quite a bit too low. She's very smart, but the tests aren't designed for her. Not to compare my kid to my dog, but I own Great Pyrenees, who I've seen listed many times as not being intelligent dogs.

My mum did the same, and it wasn't her fault, she made sure I felt safe being me and supported me the only way she knew, but society has only just started to accept that maybe girls and women can be autistic too.\n\nI was diagnosed at 26, I was non verbal till 5 years old, and I had a really, really harsh childhood due to my undiagnosed neurodivergency. All the signs were there, but I was a girl born in the 90s, and little girls in the 90s weren't autistic, that's just boys! \n\nYou support and advocate for your little girl, and that's all she needs. I'm sure you're a fantastic mother, and allow your little girl to be whatever she needs to be in that moment.", "You hope it had, but as a woman in IT, it's still prevalent that the \"softer\" parts of IT are lumped off on the women, and the more technical sides are more given to the blokes, even though some of the best coders I've come across are women.\n\nMy biggest issues with the gender is there's still a overarching belief that men will earn more than women, therefore being more 'valuable'. The number of guys I've had dates with that freak out  with a woman that may earn more is depressing. My last ex even lied to me for 4 years to make out he earnt more. It really shouldn't matter.", "Thank you! I had a brother with very bad ADHD and severe dyslexia so he got all the attention. He needed it, but as I said, I also had the traits, my older sister also had the traits, but we got good grades and, again, were polite and well behaved so we were easy to ignore. No one cared that my good grades could have been better if my dyslexia was diagnosed--I had to figure it myself in graduate school when trying to learn a non-alphabetic writing system. When I told my mom about my daughter, and how she was ignored, and how I missed them because I have a lot of the same traits and she...started talking about my brother. Not \"oh no, I missed it in you?? I'm so sorry!\" Nope. And my mom was a great mom. But he was the baby of the family and we were girls.\n\nI'm very glad my daughter will be getting help now. She was diagnosed with ADD and GAD two years ago and things have improved a lot, but now that I know where a lot of the anxiety is coming from, I hope we can alleviate more.", "Also, why refer to the wife\u2019s mother as her adopted mother?", "In India you don\u2019t get to know the gender for that exact reason. My husband\u2019s family was shocked when we told them that we knew the gender since we live in the states. They were happy since it was the first grandchild of the family.  It didn\u2019t matter to them that it was a girl or boy.", "Your interests being weird is no reason to treat you differently. That just shows you have individuality. As for your mental health, he should have been invested in getting you help. \n\nMy oldest struggles with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I try my hardest to help by taking her to appointments, getting her meds, and being there to talk. That\u2019s honestly the bare minimum a parent should do. Your dad deserves the blame.", "That's what I'm reading between the lines, a woman scared of how her emotionally dysfunctional husband will react so she puts it off as far as she can. OP, get yourself some therapy to deal with your past trauma instead of dumping it on your future generation.", "I thought that was weird too. Like what is the point of saying that", "My mother was so determined to have a boy that she never went to an ultrasound while pregnant with me because she\u2019d convinced herself I was, in fact, a boy.\n\nI was not. She\u2019s never fully forgiven me lol.", "Seriously, it\u2019s so immature. \n\nMy sister said her whole childhood she wanted to have a daughter or daughters. She said she didn\u2019t want any boys. Up until she was in middle school she said she\u2019d \u201cshove it back\u201d if it was a boy. \n\nNow she\u2019s 17 and just says she doesn\u2019t want kids. She\u2019s mature enough to realize that there\u2019s no character creation screen where you get to customize it. You get pregnant, and you\u2019re stuck with whatever that kid grows into. And that is unpredictable. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t want kids, OP wants to play daddy role model with a very specific image of a kid in his head. Two completely different things.", "OP doesn\u2019t really care about a potential son either. Kids are fully entitled to not like or be super close with their parents. In fact it ebbs and flows; kids go through phases of favoring one parent or the other all the time. OP is not ready for parenthood. I hope he can find a good therapist fast.", "Or just adopt. If you\u2019re going to have a literal tantrum about having a daughter then you shouldn\u2019t have one, go and adopt a boy. But I\u2019m sure the kind of people that throw tantrums about the baby being a girl are the same type of people that think if your kid isn\u2019t biologically related to you it isn\u2019t \u201creally yours\u201d.", "> My first thought was that she was afraid he'd pressure her to abort if it was a girl.\n\n\nI admit I didn't consider this but it actually does follow the logic based on his post. Makes her deception much more valid.", "And his behavior after he found out only confirmed her concerns."]}
