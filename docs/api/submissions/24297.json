You're still having a baby. That baby will still need all the things in that nursery. Maybe this is a good chance for you to reconsider your attitudes to sex and gender - because, spoiler alert, the baby doesn't care what colour their clothes and blankets are.", "ESH \n\nI cannot imagine why she thought it would be less painful for you to think you were having a boy and then disappoint you later. Getting your hopes up accomplishes nothing.\n\nThat said\u2026you very much did overreact in clearing out the nursery and disinviting her mother from coming over. This reaction is crazy and you talking about this pain and devestation surrounding having a girl is probably the reason she was afraid to tell you. Because she probably wants to be excited about this child and didn\u2019t want to deal with you acting like it\u2019s something devestating that it\u2019s a girl. \n\nAlso, you are projecting wayyyy too much on an unborn child. What if you did have a boy, but he wasn\u2019t as interested in this intense father-son relationship that you are craving? Can any real life father-son relationship actually even live up to the one in your head that is supposed to heal your past wounds? \n\nYour kids are real people, don\u2019t set them up for failure by having all these weird expectations for how they will better your existing traumas.", "INFO: be very honest. How would you have reacted if she told you it was a girl up front?", "ESH. Your wife allowed you to develop a bond with a child who doesn't exist. Asshole and just really stupid. How long did she think she was going to protect your feelings for? But you seem to have an extreme preference for a boy, not to mention some pretty unrealistic expectations about what a baby can do for you, which makes you a bit of an asshole yourself.", "INFO\n\nWould you have been angry / upset if she had told you right away? I feel there is some missing information.", "ESH\n\nShe\u2019s really cocked up there. Not sure what she was thinking\u2026 and don\u2019t know why she played the long game on this (why didn\u2019t she argue for gender neutral at least!).   You were going to be devastated one day or another.  But packing up the nursery is counter productive, and your MIL will be at a range of baby related events, or your wife might wonder why she\u2019s married to you. You can be as hurt or angry as you are\u2026 but you aren\u2019t going to win with that one at all, it will create life long rifts in the family. Does she deserve your trust? Hell no! But you are in a difficult situation here, so go for the one that keeps your marriage intact.  (Edit, because skim reading skipped a paragraph changed my vote)\n\nWhich leads me to my second comment... a baby isn\u2019t a chance for you relive, replay, rewrite or re script the things you didn\u2019t have in your own childhood. This baby will be an individual in their own right, please don\u2019t place too much pressure on yourself or them. Instead please love them for who they are, not what they might represent or repair of your past.", "ESH, your wife\u2019s lies were bad, however your reaction and words show that you would have reacted otherwise if you knew it would be a girl. Please seeek therapy and resolve your issues, your daughter does not deserve potentially being loved less than a baby boy.", "ESH\nShe shouldn't have lied, but you shouldn't be so focused on having a boy. You can be a strong male role model to your *daughter*\u2014if you can put aside the bias. It sounds like you want a re-do\u2014like raising a son would be like your father raising you\u2014but that doesn't work. Your child won't be you and you won't be your father, and doing things \"right\" with a son won't change how things transpired. Have a strong relationship with your child, no matter their gender.", "ESH. She lied not cool and I\u2019m not sure how you come back from that but you care that much about the gender and not just hey I want a healthy baby\u2026.. WTH. You can have a close bond with your child if you put in the effort but you have to not care about the gender. I\u2019m a girl and I was my dads best friend and his shadow growing up. He taught me how to fix cars, lawn mowers, clocks how to drive a huge stick shift tractor, ride horses. Gender doesn\u2019t matter the opportunity to teach and grow is there if you take the chance.", "ESH.\n\nHer and her mum for lieing.  You for over reacting.\n\nBut you do know you can apologise, and raise a badass girl instead, right?", "ESH. You are putting a lot of emotional weight on your pregnant wife about your unborn child.\n\nTry some therapy.\n\nNot sure what she was hoping to accomplish, as the truth would have eventually come out. \n\nTry to be a better husband.", "Children aren\u2019t emotional support animals. I\u2019m guessing your wife lied because she was scared of your reaction and also wanted to save HER feelings because she knew you\u2019d become a huge bummer once you found out. You need therapy immediately to deal with your issue. ANY healthy baby that is delivered earth-side is a miracle- no matter the gender. My husband and I have tried for the past 7 years to get pregnant and I\u2019ve had 5 miscarriages. Remember just how lucky you are that your wife is pregnant and (assumably) carrying a healthy child. YTA.", "ESH your wife for lying, you for the overreaction. A girl can wear blue land you\u2019re going to \u201cban\u201d her mother bc your wife lied wtf??? This reaction and your comments clearly showing how overly invested you are to having a boy is probably what made her worried.", "ESH. Your wife shouldn't have lied to you; finding out later has got to be harder. You clearing out the nursery and banning MIL is a rotten reaction.\n\nListen, my Mom had a very difficult childhood with abusive parents and difficult relationships with her siblings. She REALLY wanted a boy because her and her sisters got along terribly and she was terrified she'd have trouble getting along with a daughter. Back then the doctors were stupid and refused to tell her the gender so they did the nursery in gender neutral colors (yellow and greens). Low and behold, I'm her only child and I'm a girl. My Mom and I are best friends and always have been. \n\nThe relationships you have as a child, with siblings or parents, has no bearing on what your relationship with your child will be. Gender doesn't and shouldn't matter for either of you. You want to be a great parent... then BE one. I work with kids and have seen girls who are closer to their mother and girls who are closer to their father just as I've seen boys closer to their father and boys closer to their mother. How this goes between you and your kid is up to you now. Don't let the past ruin the present or the future for you and your kid.", "I was on your side until I read comments about how you'd have been a little sad to have a girl. Gross. YTA for creating an environment that made your wife lie to avoid dealing with your reaction", "ESH. If you continue this attitude, your daughter's childhood will be just like yours - without father figure. Your wife is AH for hiding the truth, but you are following her asshollery pretty close.", "ESH lying about the gender was obviously a stupid choice but \"I would have been sad but I would have come to terms after some time\" is a horrible reaction to a gender reveal. I feel really sad for this little girl. Also throwing out the nursery when you will have a child anyway is just dumb. Also What if your next child is a boy? Even if you say now you would treat them equal you by no means will. Seek counseling, also as a couple. You need to do waaayyy better than this in order to raise a child", "ESH but honestly you sound REALLY unstable: You are not going to get your trauma healed by a child?! You\u2019re actually at risk of really screwing up a boy by expecting that the wound from your lack of a decent father figure will be healed by having someone entirely dependent upon you. Also, you can\u2019t just say you really don\u2019t want a girl as much and then say that that\u2019s not problematic because it\u2019s rooted in a bad childhood. Nope, you\u2019re about to not be a decent father to your daughter. You need to be ready to accept a child of any gender if you want to be a parent. I hope you\u2019re going to grow up and redo the nursery FYI, girls can sleep in blue rooms\u2026 I\u2019m a woman and my childhood bedroom was blue and I still collect Disney Mattel dolls as a hobby! Blue doesn\u2019t make your kid a boy or even masculine presenting!\n\nYour wife and MIL were ridiculous, though you overreacted. The lie is (unintentionally) cruel and hurtful but looking at your reaction\u2026 you can see why she was probably literally scared (not for safety but for your relationship) to tell you the truth. You\u2019ve not been able to attend any appointments with her, ok maybe it\u2019s clashed with work but the way you\u2019ve expressed this here is by sounding like you\u2019re a victim of this too and heroic for working. You seem to feel the fates consipire against you - it\u2019s scary to let someone down when they present like that. You\u2019re also giving your trauma as justification for a lot, again, it\u2019s hard to let down a traumatised person even if you can\u2019t avoid it. So, you\u2019re wife has been dealing with all the realities of pregnancy without you and she tried to avoid a huge, anguished confrontation when you came back, by lying. Selfish and stupid but I see why she did it, she bought herself some time.\n\nYou now need to deal with your feelings and get some decent, intensive therapy (individually and couple\u2019s counselling). You really need to apologise to MIL, this may be controversial but in attending appointments she was basically doing something which should be your job and she was just trying to support her own daughter. Also, info (for you to consider as well as us): What would you have said at first if you knew it was a girl? Because it sounds like you\u2019d be incredibly disappointed. You need to rid yourself of expectations before the baby arrives and for the rest of the pregnancy or you\u2019ll be wanting mother and baby to take responsibility for your trauma by providing you with a catharsis that will never come. You\u2019ll move past childhood issues by working on yourself, not by projecting your trauma onto an unborn child.", "So if you have another child, are you going to prefer the son over your daughter?", "Info: why did you clear out the nursery? Does the baby no longer need a place to stay? My guy wtf?", "YTA - your wife shouldn't have lied, but your reaction was so wildly inappropriate and completely proves her fear right. You packed up the nursery and basically screamed to the world that a *girl* child is valueless, not worth preparing for or being excited about. \n\nI feel bad for your wife, and worse for your daughter.", "Info - whats missing here \n\nYoud find our eventually sooo\u2026 yeah there\u2019s something missing here.", "This was not saving your feelings, it was stringing you along. So now instead of being excited for a daughter, they\u2019ve managed to make the daughter announcement a let down. I\u2019d be pissed too", "YTA\n\nThe presence of that child will not paper over the gaping wounds of your childhood.\n\nplease go to therapy so you don\u2019t inflict your childhood trauma on your child(ren)", "NTA. I don\u2019t care if you would\u2019ve been initially disappointed about having a girl, you invested time, money and energy into making that nursery for who you thought was your little boy. It\u2019s not the fact it\u2019s a girl, it\u2019s the fact she lied to you.", "ESH. Obviously lying is shitty, but you\u2019re way worse imo for not questioning your preference for a boy and reacting so strongly. Honestly, if you\u2019re still so attached to this idea of having a boy because of your childhood, you might benefit from talking to a therapist.", "NTA, I have known people in similar situations to you craving a strong female or male bond in their lives, so I can empathize with the sentiment.\n\nYour wife and her mom were way off base lying about the gender. That is about as bad as lying about a pregnancy in general. especially given that she knew how you felt. \n\nI think a long conversation needs to be had with your wife.

She shouldn't have lied, but go watch some videos on the Internet of gender reveal parties and you'll see the looks of utter disappointment on the faces of the father to be when he discovers it's going to be a girl. There's a lot of misogyny buried in there and the poor girl is going to grow up with a father who resents her because of her gender.

What does that actually do for anyone? Definitely does not provide any benefit whatsoever.  Definitely not normal.. is that what she will teach this child??\n\nJust wanted to add that you can definitely have a strong relationship with a daughter!! You know there is a term like daddys girl! Gender  does not define a relationship! Take her fishing, hiking, play catch in the yard, teach her how to change a tire or check oil in the car, have tea parties with her and her dolls, play dress up, barbies, etc etc whatever you feel you missed out on\u2026 just build her up with all different hobbies, experiences, to be independent, etc.. \n\nGood luck!", "ESH\n\nGod damn daddy issues are wild.

The betrayal is amazing decorating the nursery, choosing names, etc. The trust may be irretrievably broken.\n\nWhat is also amazing is the people being apologists for your wife.

Your wife was mentally and emotionally manipulating you in a cruel and inhuman way.\n\nTime to get into therapy. Time to take a step back from the relationship - not the child - and get your head around her behavior.\n\nNTA but there's a whole lot more here to unpack. I do NOT recommend couples counseling with someone who is mentally manipulative. Individual therapy.", "Esh. go to therapy.", "NTA. This may be going against what most say, but IMO, this has much less to do with whether you're having a boy or a girl than it does about being lied to and deceived. You're a grown man, and your wife and MIL treated you as if you were emotionally immature and incapable of being a father to your own child, whether boy or girl. Sorry, OP. \n\nIF my husband had somehow lied to me as your wife did to you, I would have been devastated. First, because I felt sad about not having a boy. But more importantly because of how cruel it was to be lied to.", "While I firmly hold that you should be prepared to love any gender of child equally, I honestly don\u2019t see that you weren\u2019t prepared to do that from the start.\n\nIf your wife and her mother for some weird reason hadn\u2019t decided to lie and deceive you it\u2019s more than likely you would have been just as thrilled with having a daughter. \n\nThey let you build up a specific dream for no reason and then expect you to just not react to it? \n\nNope. \n\nExcluding your mil from interacting with your child I can actually understand as who would trust anyone who was fine and comfortable lying to your face about your child with said child?  I sure wouldn\u2019t be. Obviously you can\u2019t stop your wife the same way.\n\nAs for packing up the nursery, the child you build it for never existed and so metaphorically died for you. Just like a miscarriage you loved them but never got to hold them. That your daughter will need a nursery isn\u2019t the point here, she will get one obviously but not the one you made for her sibling that never was. This is about emotions not logic. \n\nNTA. They Never should have lied.", "So to protect your feelings she lied to you and led you on for months... Even seeing you paint the room blue? Did she ever intend to tell you? I don't know how you could stay with somebody like this after she purposely stabbed you in the back and twisted the knife for months! \n\nYou're NTA but you have a big problem with your wife. What she did was downright cruel. Finding out you were having a girl would have been slightly disappointing, but it wouldn't have been a big deal. Instead she dangled this boy in front of you like a carrot then snatched it away... Why? Does she enjoy your suffering? Because she caused a lot of it unnecessarily! I don't know how you can continue to be with somebody so cruel. I can't even imagine how she's going to treat children.", "NTA. I (37f) became unexpectedly pregnant 4 years ago. I never thought I would have the opportunity to be a mom, but I always knew that if it did happen, I would be a better boy mom than a girl mom. I was thrilled to finally have the chance to be a mom at all, and I knew that regardless of the child\u2019s gender, I would love them unconditionally. I was just extra thrilled when I found out I would be having a boy. I think it\u2019s sweet that you want to have a strong paternal bond with your child, just realize that both genders need that in their lives. Your wife, on the other hand, is fucking nuts about lying about something so important. If she was so concerned about revealing the sex to you, her husband and the father of this unborn child, she never should have found out and the two of you could have gone into the whole thing together not knowing what to expect. Instead, she allowed you to decorate for a traditional boys room. Her mother is just as complicit in this game. I think your actions were rash but understandable when you consider they both knew how important gender was for you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d love a baby girl any less (most dads will tell you that the moment they set eyes on the baby they were gone, hook, line, and sinker [apparently my own father told my mom I was better than a puppy lol]), , but now is the time for you to start rebuilding your trust and relationship with your wife and her mother in order to provide your sweet, innocent baby girl the loving family she deserves. Change the paint to a beautiful sky with clouds, green at the bottom, and wildflower appliqu\u00e9s. Put the furniture back in, switch from Dino\u2019s to unicorns.

Your wife shouldn\u2019t have lied to you, but if she were telling the story from her perspective I would imagine her reasoning would be that you were completely against having anything other than a boy and she was scared that you would react angrily and not accept the baby if you knew she was a girl.\n\nTrue story, I overheard a guy in in a restaurant once telling his wife while pointing to a father being affectionate with his sons, how gay the behaviour is, the wife visibly upset pointed out that there\u2019s nothing gay about a parent showing affection to their child and the guy retorted something along the lines of, well he thinks it\u2019s gay and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so glad they had girls because he could never show affection to a boy and would get angry and not be able to control himself instead of feeling like consoling a boy if they were to cry and probably be cold and distant with them otherwise because he knew he would be like his father was with him growing up and that he could only be a good girl dad. \n\nThe wife looked completely mortified at this point like it was the moment she realised how much she regretted having any children at all with a man that reasons like this and they were both quiet throughout the rest of the dinner.

I unfortunately believe that that story and yours are in a similar vein, where your expectations are not only unrealistic and skew but somewhat selfish. Because children are not an extension of us or an opportunity to heal our own inner child and past traumas. It\u2019s very unfair to place such a heavy idealistic expectation on a child before they\u2019re even born and not their burden to carry.  Even more so to place it on a factor outside of their or your own control like gender. The guy in the story probably isn\u2019t a very good dad to girls either or alternatively isn\u2019t giving himself the credit of the possibility that he would love a boy just the same.

I didn\u2019t hesitate to use my nephew\u2019s baby clothes though, nobody really cared.", "yup", "Like a lot of other commenters here, it speaks volumes to me why she lied about it. I mean, not that I can actually understand why or that I think it was a right thing to do or a smart idea at all but I can't help but wonder why she felt she needed to lie to him.

That he would clear out the nursery and disinvite her mother upon finding out that he was having a girl? Because thats not healthy. What she did was wrong, sure, but why is he so emotional about this subject that his wife felt pressured to lie about it, and when he did find out he overreacted so thoroughly?", "Maybe worth considering why you aren\u2019t tired of men being violent instead.\n\nShe had a an instinct for a reason. \n\nShe knows OP, you don\u2019t.\n\nConsider these statistical tidbits, my guy:\n\nWomen in the US are more likely to be murdered during pregnancy or soon after childbirth than to die from the three leading obstetric causes of maternal death.\n\nThe risk of homicide by partner nearly doubles during pregnancy. \n\nA third of domestic violence cases start during a pregnancy.\n\nIt is so bad it\u2019s now the standard of care to ask an expectant mother how she\u2019s being treated at home and if she\u2019s in any danger at Every Single Appointment.", "Having rigid ideas about gender is an indication in itself, preferring a boy this much and so unrealistically says he doesn't value girls, deciding and being able to clear the whole nursery is unsettling, and it's such a stupid thing to lie about, suggests there is a reason.", "Given how he reacted?", "It doesn't sound like either of these people should be having kids. At least not right now. OP should have been in therapy long before getting someone pregnant. It's one thing for a potential parent to have a slight preference for the baby's sex. But there's something deeply wrong with having such an unhealthy obsession over having a particular gender it causes your spouse and in-laws to lie to you about it to prevent (what I'm assuming they feared) a very dramatic, over-the-top response. OP's wife should have refused to get pregnant with someone that she's scared of/ unwilling to tell the truth to. She's also a terrible decision maker- I cannot imagine how she thought lying to her spouse for several months over something he's placed incredible (if misguided) importance on could possibly work out ok. Because of course he's going to feel betrayed.\n\n There was a 50% chance the fetus was going to be a girl. It sounds like neither of these soon-to-be-parents considered that to be a real possibility and prepared for it. Which seems like the bare minimum that should have been done before trying to get pregnant.", "Yes, but I presume you painted that room blue *for* your daughter. That's the difference.\n\nI don't think theres a problem with having a babys room any colour.", "if he was just upset about the betrayal, he wouldnt target the nursery. he wouldnt target his future baby as he did by destroying the nursery. if he cleared out OPs and his wife's personal bedroom, then you could point to him being upset about the betrayal. the nursery is a direct sign that he is harboring resentment toward an unborn child.", "I agree. I believe my judgement leans into ESH, and also Everyone Needs Therapy, because this is breeding grounds for a miserable and dysfunctional family environment years down the line, with the daughter being caught in the crossfire as the middle person.\n\nThis isn't just AITA; this is just sad.", "It's fucked up that he is sad and disappointed about his own child before she is even *born* just because she is a girl, he may \"come to terms with it\" or whetever but the second he has a male child the girl is gonna be ignored, emotionally neglected by him, and he passes kn the generational trauma he so claims to want to end with his son's birth.\n\nTo treat children as emotional Investments already makes him TA.", "I think what they mean is that there\u2019s deep rooted reasons for a reaction like that.

Imagine being pregnant and terrified that you are the only parent who'd love this little girl unconditionally. She's uncomfortable, maybe in pain but the magic  of pregnancy is lost even for her because it's replaced by the fear of what if he doesn't love the little one. She definitely made a stupid choice but hormones and fear and for all we know all the negative emotions piled up.", "This is supposed to be a partnership. Lying to your partner about something critical that they're going to find out anyway it's not exactly helping the problem. \n\nThis is already dumped on her. And yes, it absolutely was her responsibility to encourage her husband into therapy instead of running away from the problem.

Come off it. \n\nI mean, we *know* the wife lied to him. She is the one showing unequivocally questionable behaviour in this story, not OP.", "Because she's the AH here. All of this is on her.

Two adults decided to lie to another, and now are all Pikachu face when the lied-to-adults reacts badly.", "> i can't help but wonder why she felt she needed to lie to him\n\nSo you're assuming that reason is because he's someone who would actively hate a daughter. Theres a lot of reasons you can insert here. You can make either party to be the asshole if you just make stuff up. \"Maybe she wanted to lead him on and pull the rug out from under him for fun.\" See, I can do it too.", "Does it actually speak volumes though or is this just an assumption?", "He\u2019s clearly got issues and should be seeking therapy, he should\u2019ve sought therapy way before putting a baby in his partner.", "The lie would be enough for most people to lose it, I don't think it's fair to say he reacted this way because she's having a girl.\n\nShe let him build up a whole idea of the baby he was going to have, for no reason, and then ripped it away. Meanwhile the MIL was sitting by casually watching it all. I'd be beyond pissed.\n\nIf she felt the need to lie or buy time she could always say that the doctors weren't sure of the gender because they baby was in a weird position or something. What was her end game in telling him it was a boy?", "From my perspective, while the sex of the child was at the centre of the lie, it wasn't what caused the clearing of the nursery. That was the lie that was told to him for a long time by two people who he thought he could trust, but they betrayed that trust by lying to him. \n\nTo clear the lie from the house, the nursery has to be redone. When he found out about the lie, he took the now unnecessary stuff out of the nursery and banned one of the lying people from the house.", "To answer your question - NO I don't think that it is that big of a deal to him. What is a big deal to him and rightfully so, the lie and illusion that her and her mother created and sold him. This is a complete betrayal of his trust. And what it did was plant an idea in his head, an idea that he was very receptive to, due to his past trauma with his father. In the movie \"Inception\" there is the dialogue that if you can plant a false idea in someone's conscious that is the most powerful thing possible. Because then that person constructs an entire storyline in their head based on that falsehood. Wife and MIL engaged in the ultimate betrayal here. Imagine an entire lifetime of never ending trauma that you have always hoped to reverse, then you begin constructing in your mind all the different scenarios of how you are going to reverse all the hurtful things that you experienced in your life, and continue to experience, and then to have that entire world of hopes and dreams you had crafted be shattered by the betrayal of the people you trusted the most- it's debilitating and something you can't come back from. OP needs to leave, and if not, know that you can never fully trust your wife again, not fully. She has shown a willingness to lie and betray about not just anything, but lie to destroy your dreams and hopes. \n\nThere is not one piece of evidence that indicates OP wouldn't love a daughter any less than a son, and there is not one piece of evidence that suggests OP would or is violent about anything. He acted the way he did due to a complete and absolute betrayal by the one he trusted the most. \n\nDefinitely NOT THE ASSHOLE\nSave yourself a lifetime of wondering when the next betrayal is going to occur. Walk away", "What about it? Overreacting as in taking shit out of the nursery they decorated for a boy - as a reaction to his wife lying about the baby being a boy for months? His wife created an attachment to a kid - gender, name and all - that doesn't exist that way. Even mothers who were given the wrong gender prior to birth report feeling weird about it, like the kid they were preparing to have didn't exist. And he's reacting not just to that, but his wife's intentional deception and betrayal knowing how much it'd hurt.\n\nGiven all that - that reaction makes someone likely to be violent and abusive? How about him actually being violent or abusive towards her? He was upset and angry, but all he did was ban his mum from his house over partaking in the lie and clearing out a nursery. Like, really?

They refused to tell him my gender. Because the thought back than was: Men want sons. So, don't tell them the gender. So, they'll definitely come to the hospital and they'll fall in love with the baby despite it being a girl. If they learn it's a girl beforehand, fathers might not turn up.\n\nBy the way, I was born in the GDR. We had enforced equality. Women were expected to work. Our abortion law explicitely stated it's a woman's choice to terminate a pregnancy. My mother was studying a STEM field and wasn't one of a handful of women, but they were a sizeable group. Like 30%, even going up to half of the sudents in certain subjects. And still, some fathers had to be basically tricked into loving their daughters.", "Eh at least she would have had support and love for the baby for the first 9 months.", "OP needs therapy, not a baby ... :(", "He specifically wrote a paragraph about how his 'childhood trauma' is the reason he wants a boy (already a red-flag, considering children an emotional investment and way to cure your own trauma), he clearly wanted us to sympathise with his 'need' to have a baby boy and had this overreaction specifically because he found out the baby's a girl. He even said past trauma was reopened for him, when previously he had specified his past trauma was what determined the preference he had.\n\nImagine his wife for whatever reason says she was having a girl, later he finds out its a boy. Do you imagine the same reaction? He may react somewhat negatively because he was 'hurt' thinking about the 'terrible dissapointment' that a girl would be, but suddenly the lie becomes a lot less potent when the truth is the sweet one he desires, right?", "Now let's switch the genders, the wife lied to him that she was having a girl, mother-in-law slips it's a boy. Is she still disinvited?", "Yes, violent. Do you think he calmly threw out everything in the nursery? I get maybe kicking something out of frustration but emptying a whole room takes some time during which he could have calmed down. No normal person comes up with this plan if she isn't scared of his reaction. She probably intended to make it pass as an error in the ultrasound or something (which accomplishes nothing anyway). They both need therapy, separately, but OP is YTA.", "He made it pretty clear to her that the kid better be a boy.\n\nShe was clearly counting on his being smitten with the baby upon seeing it.", "And if the gender of the baby is the determining fact on if your partner will love the child you had together then you shouldn\u2019t be having kids with that person.", "Yes because being supported through the pregnancy makes being a single mom or married to a man who doesn\u2019t want the child so much easier.", "I\u2019m sure given his rigid gender expectations he won\u2019t think it\u2019s manly to seek counseling.\n\nThere\u2019s a decided whiff of avoiding awareness on why she felt the need to lie. Most women don\u2019t feel that need with their partners.\n\nAnd so the generational trauma will continue\u2026", "First of all, I don't really think this is an overreaction. That is a huge deal, to lie to someone about their baby and then go so far as to pretend to name it after their grandfather ect.\n\nI'm not saying it's great that he has such a preference for a boy. But we don't actually know what his reaction would have been to learn it's a girl, without all the lies, so I feel it's unfair to judge him on it.\n\nIt's a time of a lot of emotions so I don't think you can predict how people are going to feel about things, most people don't even realise how they'll feel about things themself.\n\nHe should 100% get therapy for his past trauma, and not dump it on a kid, whatever the gender, but OP's wife really stirred this up in the worst way and guaranteed that it would bring out the worst emotions in everyone.", "If she helped lie for months, yes.
