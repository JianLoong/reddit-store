You're still having a baby. That baby will still need all the things in that nursery. Maybe this is a good chance for you to reconsider your attitudes to sex and gender - because, spoiler alert, the baby doesn't care what colour their clothes and blankets are.", "ESH \n\nI cannot imagine why she thought it would be less painful for you to think you were having a boy and then disappoint you later. Getting your hopes up accomplishes nothing.\n\nThat said\u2026you very much did overreact in clearing out the nursery and disinviting her mother from coming over. This reaction is crazy and you talking about this pain and devestation surrounding having a girl is probably the reason she was afraid to tell you. Because she probably wants to be excited about this child and didn\u2019t want to deal with you acting like it\u2019s something devestating that it\u2019s a girl. \n\nAlso, you are projecting wayyyy too much on an unborn child. What if you did have a boy, but he wasn\u2019t as interested in this intense father-son relationship that you are craving? Can any real life father-son relationship actually even live up to the one in your head that is supposed to heal your past wounds? \n\nYour kids are real people, don\u2019t set them up for failure by having all these weird expectations for how they will better your existing traumas.", "INFO: be very honest. How would you have reacted if she told you it was a girl up front?", "ESH. Your wife allowed you to develop a bond with a child who doesn't exist. Asshole and just really stupid. How long did she think she was going to protect your feelings for? But you seem to have an extreme preference for a boy, not to mention some pretty unrealistic expectations about what a baby can do for you, which makes you a bit of an asshole yourself.", "INFO\n\nWould you have been angry / upset if she had told you right away? I feel there is some missing information.", "ESH\n\nShe\u2019s really cocked up there. Not sure what she was thinking\u2026 and don\u2019t know why she played the long game on this (why didn\u2019t she argue for gender neutral at least!).   You were going to be devastated one day or another.  But packing up the nursery is counter productive, and your MIL will be at a range of baby related events, or your wife might wonder why she\u2019s married to you. You can be as hurt or angry as you are\u2026 but you aren\u2019t going to win with that one at all, it will create life long rifts in the family. Does she deserve your trust? Hell no! But you are in a difficult situation here, so go for the one that keeps your marriage intact.  (Edit, because skim reading skipped a paragraph changed my vote)\n\nWhich leads me to my second comment... a baby isn\u2019t a chance for you relive, replay, rewrite or re script the things you didn\u2019t have in your own childhood. This baby will be an individual in their own right, please don\u2019t place too much pressure on yourself or them. Instead please love them for who they are, not what they might represent or repair of your past.", "ESH, your wife\u2019s lies were bad, however your reaction and words show that you would have reacted otherwise if you knew it would be a girl. Please seeek therapy and resolve your issues, your daughter does not deserve potentially being loved less than a baby boy.", "ESH\nShe shouldn't have lied, but you shouldn't be so focused on having a boy. You can be a strong male role model to your *daughter*\u2014if you can put aside the bias. It sounds like you want a re-do\u2014like raising a son would be like your father raising you\u2014but that doesn't work. Your child won't be you and you won't be your father, and doing things \"right\" with a son won't change how things transpired. Have a strong relationship with your child, no matter their gender.", "ESH. She lied not cool and I\u2019m not sure how you come back from that but you care that much about the gender and not just hey I want a healthy baby\u2026.. WTH. You can have a close bond with your child if you put in the effort but you have to not care about the gender. I\u2019m a girl and I was my dads best friend and his shadow growing up. He taught me how to fix cars, lawn mowers, clocks how to drive a huge stick shift tractor, ride horses. Gender doesn\u2019t matter the opportunity to teach and grow is there if you take the chance.", "ESH.\n\nHer and her mum for lieing.  You for over reacting.\n\nBut you do know you can apologise, and raise a badass girl instead, right?", "ESH. You are putting a lot of emotional weight on your pregnant wife about your unborn child.\n\nTry some therapy.\n\nNot sure what she was hoping to accomplish, as the truth would have eventually come out. \n\nTry to be a better husband.", "Children aren\u2019t emotional support animals. I\u2019m guessing your wife lied because she was scared of your reaction and also wanted to save HER feelings because she knew you\u2019d become a huge bummer once you found out. You need therapy immediately to deal with your issue. ANY healthy baby that is delivered earth-side is a miracle- no matter the gender. My husband and I have tried for the past 7 years to get pregnant and I\u2019ve had 5 miscarriages. Remember just how lucky you are that your wife is pregnant and (assumably) carrying a healthy child. YTA.", "ESH your wife for lying, you for the overreaction. A girl can wear blue land you\u2019re going to \u201cban\u201d her mother bc your wife lied wtf??? This reaction and your comments clearly showing how overly invested you are to having a boy is probably what made her worried.", "ESH. Your wife shouldn't have lied to you; finding out later has got to be harder. You clearing out the nursery and banning MIL is a rotten reaction.\n\nListen, my Mom had a very difficult childhood with abusive parents and difficult relationships with her siblings. She REALLY wanted a boy because her and her sisters got along terribly and she was terrified she'd have trouble getting along with a daughter. Back then the doctors were stupid and refused to tell her the gender so they did the nursery in gender neutral colors (yellow and greens). Low and behold, I'm her only child and I'm a girl. My Mom and I are best friends and always have been. \n\nThe relationships you have as a child, with siblings or parents, has no bearing on what your relationship with your child will be. Gender doesn't and shouldn't matter for either of you. You want to be a great parent... then BE one. I work with kids and have seen girls who are closer to their mother and girls who are closer to their father just as I've seen boys closer to their father and boys closer to their mother. How this goes between you and your kid is up to you now. Don't let the past ruin the present or the future for you and your kid.", "I was on your side until I read comments about how you'd have been a little sad to have a girl. Gross. YTA for creating an environment that made your wife lie to avoid dealing with your reaction", "ESH. If you continue this attitude, your daughter's childhood will be just like yours - without father figure. Your wife is AH for hiding the truth, but you are following her asshollery pretty close.", "ESH lying about the gender was obviously a stupid choice but \"I would have been sad but I would have come to terms after some time\" is a horrible reaction to a gender reveal. I feel really sad for this little girl. Also throwing out the nursery when you will have a child anyway is just dumb. Also What if your next child is a boy? Even if you say now you would treat them equal you by no means will. Seek counseling, also as a couple. You need to do waaayyy better than this in order to raise a child", "ESH but honestly you sound REALLY unstable: You are not going to get your trauma healed by a child?! You\u2019re actually at risk of really screwing up a boy by expecting that the wound from your lack of a decent father figure will be healed by having someone entirely dependent upon you. Also, you can\u2019t just say you really don\u2019t want a girl as much and then say that that\u2019s not problematic because it\u2019s rooted in a bad childhood. Nope, you\u2019re about to not be a decent father to your daughter. You need to be ready to accept a child of any gender if you want to be a parent. I hope you\u2019re going to grow up and redo the nursery FYI, girls can sleep in blue rooms\u2026 I\u2019m a woman and my childhood bedroom was blue and I still collect Disney Mattel dolls as a hobby! Blue doesn\u2019t make your kid a boy or even masculine presenting!\n\nYour wife and MIL were ridiculous, though you overreacted. The lie is (unintentionally) cruel and hurtful but looking at your reaction\u2026 you can see why she was probably literally scared (not for safety but for your relationship) to tell you the truth. You\u2019ve not been able to attend any appointments with her, ok maybe it\u2019s clashed with work but the way you\u2019ve expressed this here is by sounding like you\u2019re a victim of this too and heroic for working. You seem to feel the fates consipire against you - it\u2019s scary to let someone down when they present like that. You\u2019re also giving your trauma as justification for a lot, again, it\u2019s hard to let down a traumatised person even if you can\u2019t avoid it. So, you\u2019re wife has been dealing with all the realities of pregnancy without you and she tried to avoid a huge, anguished confrontation when you came back, by lying. Selfish and stupid but I see why she did it, she bought herself some time.\n\nYou now need to deal with your feelings and get some decent, intensive therapy (individually and couple\u2019s counselling). You really need to apologise to MIL, this may be controversial but in attending appointments she was basically doing something which should be your job and she was just trying to support her own daughter. Also, info (for you to consider as well as us): What would you have said at first if you knew it was a girl? Because it sounds like you\u2019d be incredibly disappointed. You need to rid yourself of expectations before the baby arrives and for the rest of the pregnancy or you\u2019ll be wanting mother and baby to take responsibility for your trauma by providing you with a catharsis that will never come. You\u2019ll move past childhood issues by working on yourself, not by projecting your trauma onto an unborn child.", "So if you have another child, are you going to prefer the son over your daughter?", "Info: why did you clear out the nursery? Does the baby no longer need a place to stay? My guy wtf?", "YTA - your wife shouldn't have lied, but your reaction was so wildly inappropriate and completely proves her fear right. You packed up the nursery and basically screamed to the world that a *girl* child is valueless, not worth preparing for or being excited about. \n\nI feel bad for your wife, and worse for your daughter.", "Info - whats missing here \n\nYoud find our eventually sooo\u2026 yeah there\u2019s something missing here.", "This was not saving your feelings, it was stringing you along. So now instead of being excited for a daughter, they\u2019ve managed to make the daughter announcement a let down. I\u2019d be pissed too", "YTA\n\nThe presence of that child will not paper over the gaping wounds of your childhood.\n\nplease go to therapy so you don\u2019t inflict your childhood trauma on your child(ren)", "NTA. I don\u2019t care if you would\u2019ve been initially disappointed about having a girl, you invested time, money and energy into making that nursery for who you thought was your little boy. It\u2019s not the fact it\u2019s a girl, it\u2019s the fact she lied to you.", "ESH. Obviously lying is shitty, but you\u2019re way worse imo for not questioning your preference for a boy and reacting so strongly. Honestly, if you\u2019re still so attached to this idea of having a boy because of your childhood, you might benefit from talking to a therapist.", "NTA, I have known people in similar situations to you craving a strong female or male bond in their lives, so I can empathize with the sentiment.\n\nYour wife and her mom were way off base lying about the gender. That is about as bad as lying about a pregnancy in general. especially given that she knew how you felt. \n\nI think a long conversation needs to be had with your wife.

She shouldn't have lied, but go watch some videos on the Internet of gender reveal parties and you'll see the looks of utter disappointment on the faces of the father to be when he discovers it's going to be a girl. There's a lot of misogyny buried in there and the poor girl is going to grow up with a father who resents her because of her gender.

What does that actually do for anyone? Definitely does not provide any benefit whatsoever.  Definitely not normal.. is that what she will teach this child??\n\nJust wanted to add that you can definitely have a strong relationship with a daughter!! You know there is a term like daddys girl! Gender  does not define a relationship! Take her fishing, hiking, play catch in the yard, teach her how to change a tire or check oil in the car, have tea parties with her and her dolls, play dress up, barbies, etc etc whatever you feel you missed out on\u2026 just build her up with all different hobbies, experiences, to be independent, etc.. \n\nGood luck!", "ESH\n\nGod damn daddy issues are wild.

The betrayal is amazing decorating the nursery, choosing names, etc. The trust may be irretrievably broken.\n\nWhat is also amazing is the people being apologists for your wife.

Your wife was mentally and emotionally manipulating you in a cruel and inhuman way.\n\nTime to get into therapy. Time to take a step back from the relationship - not the child - and get your head around her behavior.\n\nNTA but there's a whole lot more here to unpack. I do NOT recommend couples counseling with someone who is mentally manipulative. Individual therapy.", "Esh. go to therapy.", "NTA. This may be going against what most say, but IMO, this has much less to do with whether you're having a boy or a girl than it does about being lied to and deceived. You're a grown man, and your wife and MIL treated you as if you were emotionally immature and incapable of being a father to your own child, whether boy or girl. Sorry, OP. \n\nIF my husband had somehow lied to me as your wife did to you, I would have been devastated. First, because I felt sad about not having a boy. But more importantly because of how cruel it was to be lied to.", "While I firmly hold that you should be prepared to love any gender of child equally, I honestly don\u2019t see that you weren\u2019t prepared to do that from the start.\n\nIf your wife and her mother for some weird reason hadn\u2019t decided to lie and deceive you it\u2019s more than likely you would have been just as thrilled with having a daughter. \n\nThey let you build up a specific dream for no reason and then expect you to just not react to it? \n\nNope. \n\nExcluding your mil from interacting with your child I can actually understand as who would trust anyone who was fine and comfortable lying to your face about your child with said child?  I sure wouldn\u2019t be. Obviously you can\u2019t stop your wife the same way.\n\nAs for packing up the nursery, the child you build it for never existed and so metaphorically died for you. Just like a miscarriage you loved them but never got to hold them. That your daughter will need a nursery isn\u2019t the point here, she will get one obviously but not the one you made for her sibling that never was. This is about emotions not logic. \n\nNTA. They Never should have lied.", "So to protect your feelings she lied to you and led you on for months... Even seeing you paint the room blue? Did she ever intend to tell you? I don't know how you could stay with somebody like this after she purposely stabbed you in the back and twisted the knife for months! \n\nYou're NTA but you have a big problem with your wife. What she did was downright cruel. Finding out you were having a girl would have been slightly disappointing, but it wouldn't have been a big deal. Instead she dangled this boy in front of you like a carrot then snatched it away... Why? Does she enjoy your suffering? Because she caused a lot of it unnecessarily! I don't know how you can continue to be with somebody so cruel. I can't even imagine how she's going to treat children.", "NTA. I (37f) became unexpectedly pregnant 4 years ago. I never thought I would have the opportunity to be a mom, but I always knew that if it did happen, I would be a better boy mom than a girl mom. I was thrilled to finally have the chance to be a mom at all, and I knew that regardless of the child\u2019s gender, I would love them unconditionally. I was just extra thrilled when I found out I would be having a boy. I think it\u2019s sweet that you want to have a strong paternal bond with your child, just realize that both genders need that in their lives. Your wife, on the other hand, is fucking nuts about lying about something so important. If she was so concerned about revealing the sex to you, her husband and the father of this unborn child, she never should have found out and the two of you could have gone into the whole thing together not knowing what to expect. Instead, she allowed you to decorate for a traditional boys room. Her mother is just as complicit in this game. I think your actions were rash but understandable when you consider they both knew how important gender was for you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d love a baby girl any less (most dads will tell you that the moment they set eyes on the baby they were gone, hook, line, and sinker [apparently my own father told my mom I was better than a puppy lol]), , but now is the time for you to start rebuilding your trust and relationship with your wife and her mother in order to provide your sweet, innocent baby girl the loving family she deserves. Change the paint to a beautiful sky with clouds, green at the bottom, and wildflower appliqu\u00e9s. Put the furniture back in, switch from Dino\u2019s to unicorns.

At least he\u2019s honest and if the child never knows/he doesn\u2019t treat the daughter any different there\u2019s no problem.

If we decide on more kids, there might be a part of me that's quietly hoping for a boy", "that he would react badly to finding out it was a girl.  Which he has admited to.", "You should read his comments about having a girl", "So having a girl is like having a carrot snatched away?", "I think it was an overreaction, but regardless of that, they\u2019re still having the baby. There\u2019s no point in throwing away perfectly good stuff just because it\u2019s blue.", "It clears a slate, in a sense. It allows her to bring honesty to the table regarding anything going in there, and you deserve that.", "The ultrasound person would do that accidentally. His wife and MIL didn't just lie to him about the gender and that was that. They deceived him for literal months and even went through the motions of buying boy related things and painting the room as if they were going to have a boy. I can understand where she's coming from. I get that he came on too strong about wanting a boy but but saying YTA is diminishing what she did. EHS", "Kids are not therapy to solve your daddy issues, pay a professional ffs", "I\u2019m just wondering if she was legitimately scared to tell you because she didn\u2019t think you would respond well. Honestly, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re really in a mental place where you\u2019re ready to be a father if you would have needed that much time to \u2018come to terms\u2019 with your child\u2019s sex. I\u2019m gonna say ESH.", "That's EXACTLY why she lied. She knew how you would react. It's very upsetting to know you're carrying a girl knowing your partner wants a boy more.", "I really hope you're in therapy, because it will never be your child's job to fix your bad childhood, and it is never appropriate to put that kind of pressure on a child. You really need to work on your own issues for yourself, and not expect other people to cure the past for you. What if you have a son, but he turns out to be very different from you, and the two you just never manage to be particularly close? What will you do? Will you pressure him to change who he is in order to fit your idealized notion of who your son should be? If he resists, will you blame him for failing you? People do things like this to their children every day, and it is enormously destructive. My father (who spent a lot of time counseling people) used to say that parents love their children not so that their children will love them back, but so their children will love their own children \u2013 because it's the parents' love that helps to transform a totally self-focused infant into an adult who can care about and love others. But your focus is entirely on what you're going to get out of parenthood \u2013 what your child will give you \u2013 which is backwards. \n\nFurthermore, I can't help but worry about what will happen if you have a son down the road. Is your extreme focus on having a son to cure your past pain going to lead to your daughter sitting by and watching as her father pours all his time and energy and love into her brother?\n\nSeriously, you need therapy, and you need it now, before you f--k up your children.\n\nI'm sorry your wife lied to you. That was a bad decision on her part. I suspect she did it, at least in part, because she was worried about the things I've mentioned here, but that isn't an excuse. So therapy for the two of you would probably also be a very good idea.", "You do know fathers and daughters have a stronger bond and you will be her hero.", "[deleted]", "Idk why you\u2019re getting downvoted, you\u2019re not an asshole and you\u2019re being honest about your feelings, you\u2019re chillin", "People don't lie about something that easily found out unless they think there's a reason.  Why do you think your partner was afraid to tell you?\n\nFFS get some therapy, both for your past issues and to make sure you don't perpetuate this cycle with your child.  Because nothing they can do will live up to the fictional bond you have in your head.", "Agreed. What do you do when you're \"a little sad\"? Not what OP did.\n\nEven if you're cool with that level of gender preference, OP is still has ridiculous expectations for their relationship with their child.", "Poor kid", "That\u2019s not great. ESH", "So homecoming would have been jolly: \u201cThanks for dealing all the pregnancy related issues, practical and emotional, without me whilst I travel for work. Now that I\u2019ve arrived back and you\u2019ve told me what a letdown our unborn child is, I\u2019m just going to quietly cry in a corner and make you feel like a failure. Because when you push a human I helped to create, out of your vagina, it\u2019s genitala will be suboptimal for me.\u201d\u2026\n\nYou need to look beyond your own trauma at how utterly selfish and hurtful that attitude is and you need to fix it (and she needs to heal the trust between you!) before this completely innocent girl is born.", "Not the right emotion not even close", "Why are people upset that you would be sad. Go to any pregnancy community and this happens everyday to so many women and men on there.

She\u2019s dumb but if anyone is showing signs of severe mental illness, it\u2019s OP.", "He's probably been vocal about wanting a son throughout the pregnancy", "I don\u2019t get all the downvotes on your comment. Yes he had an extreme reaction to find out it was a girl but his wife lied to him about his own kids gender - like what the hell! I could never imagine doing this to my husband, it is absolutely psychotic", "I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nMy question would be: why did you always want to be a boy mom? What can your daughters not do or what needs in you can they not satisfy?", "I don't see any other reason someone would lie about something like that, that's exactly what I thought, especially after I saw him directly mention it. I hate that people who claim they want children put conditions on it like that. Some people can't even have them and desperately want them and would love every gender; meanwhile there are people like this who tear down a whole nursery in dissapointment because hurrr boys blue girls pink even though a newborn can't possibly have a preference. Like what does he think, having \"boy\" stuff in a \"girl\" room is going to warp her mind??? What year is this even", "I was the first child and a daughter, my brother came next and it was abundantly clear to myself and everyone surrounding my family that my father preferred the child with a penis. \u201cMy Boy\u201d was the golden child and everything I did from an incredibly early age was to attempt to get my father to love me like he loved him. Please get your priorities in line before the possible future son. Us daughters KNOW when a son is preferred and it can really mess us up.", "You need to get therapy like yesterday because if you ever do have a son, you will make him your golden child while your daughter is put on the back burner and give her a childhood filled with hurt without a strong father figure. You will always hope for that boy, but why can\u2019t your daughter have a strong bond with her dad? Why only your son? You need to go to therapy because god forbid you have a son, this absolute desire to bond with a son will hurt your daughter and even if you don\u2019t. Do you want to hurt your daughter and continue the cycle of dysfunction or do you want to end it?\n\nYou also focus heavily on your past hurts, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you are the only one considering your wife has an adopted mom that you felt comfortable banning.", "And therein lies the issue. You are too emotionally invested in having a son. I am sure you will treat your daughter well, but she will never be a son. I don\u2019t condone what your wife did at all, but I can see why she did it", "How can your daughter ever hope to live up to your dress for a boy?", "Yes, but a bad reaction at first would have been far better because the more time he had to get used to the idea, the more he would have possibly started looking forward to having his baby girl. Now, he has two of the most important women in his life, having lied to him. So he can't trust them. How on earth is that meant to make him feel. I imagine he's thinking, will she be like her mother? Will she lie to me, too? And OP, if you're reading this, no, she might take after you in more ways than you expect. Just spend time with her bond with her, and your farther daughter relationship will be a beautiful one. Have faith and be there for her.", "It was the deception that made him react the way he did. He literally even said so himself. He did not express it in a remotely appropriate way but ig that's what happens when you break someone's trust over something so monumental. He's a asshole but so is she.", "Christ, what did I miss. Let me check...", "It's tinged with lies.", "Wrong, ultrasound people still get it wrong. \n\nThe only thing she did wrong was get pregnant by a boy pretending to be a man.

Human beings are naturally bias.

Women often experience gender disappointment, and they get less trouble for it. I don\u2019t understand the issue - as long as you get on board, what\u2019s wrong with being privately disappointed for a moment? As a woman, I am really looking forward to having both a son and a daughter - if I have only boys or only girls, I definitely see myself being disappointed.

I went through torture to carry mine. Even when I knew I always choose neutral anyway. Like winning the pooh or hot air balloons or Disney in general", "Lol he's sad and disappointed", "Also wrong. Ultrasound people aren't trying to deceive you, she was doing that knowingly. She should have been an adult and actually given him the opportunity to react. Instead she ASSUMED how he was going to react. Do we know he was whining about it to her? Or was he confiding in her as a partner about what he hoped? \n\nShe is absolutely not without fault. That's a monumental thing to lie to someone about. Like someone else said, now instead of giving him the chance to be excited to have a girl, she turned this into a negative experience where he is sad not to have a boy AND now has to wade through the emotions of having had his trust broken.", "It bananas, but it's clear OP would have been disappointed as hell so I can see how the wife (as crazy as it is) lied. Frankly, it sounds like a....not very healthy relationship if the wife is so scared of her husband's disappointment she lies about the gender.", "Hence, ESH.", "With almost 29 years of experience of being a woman, I\u2019d be terrified to bring a daughter into this world.

For some inexplicable reason she tells OP it's a girl and he finds out later it's actually a boy. Would OP have reacted the same way, tearing down the nursery and banning MIL? Feeling lost? Given how much OP's past factored into his pain on discovering the real betrayal, I suspect this reverse betrayal would be less painful. OP, feel free to weigh in if you're reading down here in the weeds.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong and it is just the lying that has OP so upset.

Why might you have envisioned protecting sons rather than daughters? I believe that you're probably a good mum and it's great that you take care of them so well. I'm just not sure why you were so attached to the idea of boys rather than girls in the first place.

My bigger desire would be for people to really think about where this desire for a boy is coming from. A lot of women suffer because of this gender bias. Honestly, boys suffer too because parents seem to desire this stereotypical idea of what makes a boy, and boys are far from a monolith.
