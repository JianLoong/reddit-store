But you did, so my official ruling is NTA.\n\nThat said: it would not be productive. You already told her twice. She will not listen. Generously, she has a different idea than you of what makes a gift good; in her mind, the fact that it\u2019s what you want AND cheaper made it a good gift. That\u2019s the generous read\u2014the other read is that she simply doesn\u2019t care enough to listen closely, and cares more about her savings. \n\nAnd the truth is probably in between those things, and no matter what, it really, really sounds like at best she would just ignore what you said and at worst be really hurt and feel that you were causing problems over nothing.

I got a ton of presents that more than covered the cost of a furby and then I opened up what looked like a furby, but was just a stuffed animal. I was soooo disappointed. I remember nothing else I got that year. Yes, I appreciated the other stuff. But I would have traded it all in in a second to have a real furby. Instead I had a stuffed animal that I am pretty sure I ended up chucking a few months later. \n\nI would be honest and tell your mom you really wanted the official Lego set.
