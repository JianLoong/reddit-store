Stepping outside the house for a few moments is no different, nothing magically changes because you are in the fresh air. They are safe, you can see them and you can get to them as quickly as you could if you needed to from the toilet. \n\nHowever, use their outrage to your advantave. Ask your MiL to come and spell you a while. And you are looking after three babies 24/7 and studying online. Dad can spell you too - he is working less than you are just paid for it. An half-hour to walk round the block shouldn't be unreasonable.", "NTA. \nI\u2019m a mother and I know how hard it can be, especially in the beginning, and I only had one to deal with. \n\nWith triplets, it must be hard and I can only send positive thoughts your way.\n\nSomeone once told me, when I was dealing with my newborn, that if my mind started to go to a dark place, it was okay to set my baby down and take a breather. Even if they were crying.\n\nWe go through so much with pregnancy and birth during the early months and it can be overwhelming.\n\nYour husband needs to get you some help or take some time off to stay at home. And also, stop with the judgemental attitude. It\u2019s not helping anyone.\n\nGood luck and sending positive thoughts your way!", "NTA it\u2019s important to do this when you\u2019re overwhelmed.", " I get that you are just right outside, but since they are in the house and you are not, it could be minor neglect? Not really sure. It's a bit of a gray area. If you want fresh air you probably ought to take the babies with you in a stroller, or at least have them very close by to the door.\nEdit: I doubt that harm is going to come to them , especially when you have the monitor available and can rush back, but this does seem like a bit of extreme reaction, having to leave the house like that. You may want to seek out therapy, and/or figure out some kind of schedule for taking care of the kids that gives you more time off from looking after them. How often is the husband taking shifts?", "NTA.  There is no difference between being on the porch (not in the same room) and being in a different room in a very big house.

Those first few months are tough, but I believe in you.", "NTA , but your hubs needs to stop sharing negativity with his fam.\n\nStepping outside to take a breather is good for you and therefore good for the babies. That said - try not to make those breathers too long while babies are so upset, but it sounds like you're just taking a second to breathe and calm down. \n\nDad shouldn't be saying anything but positive things about you to his family. In general, unless there is an active way they can help with something, there's not good that will come from complaining about your spouse to your family, as that will stick in their minds moving forward. If he just needed to complain about being frustrated, which is fair, he needs to go to a trusted friend. I hope you can talk to him about how much his family means to you and that him sharing complaints with his parents causes a rift in your relationship. The only reason I could imagine him mentioning this and it being positive would be for him to say, \"Hey fam, OP is getting really overwhelmed during the day. Totally understandable since there are three babies crying! It helps her to step outside for a few minutes for fresh air, but the babies don't love this. It would be really helpful if anyone has some free time one day to go give her a break.\" If they're gonna be mad about it, they can help.\n\nNow, if you were doing something to actually harm the babies and he needed advice or help with that, obviously that's a different scenario.

But if you talk to your fianc\u00e9 and in laws about getting overwhelmed the in laws might give you ideas on how to go about it. Also try parenting classes. Going outside feeling when you are feeling overwhelmed is ok though keep the door a bit open. Also babies cry sometimes it is for no reason. I babysat a baby that cried when she wanted to held then a literal second later she didn\u2019t want to be held and the process started over again. She was just a having a bad day because of teething. \n\nNTA by the way.", "Everyone does this. Do you think parents don't go into the garden with a baby monitor? This is as stupid as them being hysterical about you leaving the room when a baby is sleeping (Again, baby monitors)! I would split and take your husband for everything he has. Ask for joint custody. Even if you gave him main custody there is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA and you are actually doing the *right* thing by taking yourself out of the situation to cool down. \n\nYour fiance and family shouldn't be shaming you, they should be offering up support and solutions to help you. \n\nI only had a single baby, at 37.

This fiance should be looking for ways to support you, not blame you.", "NTA, I think.\n\nMy own approach to parenting has been to embrace stoicism. That is, I brought this self-conscious being into existence without its consent. My duty is absolute. So it doesn't matter what I'm feeling inside. I *must* do what I *must* do. So whatever it is, I just let it batter me. Let me be miserable. I'll live....\n\nBut then I'm not left alone caring for triplets all day.

You have a monitor on them. They are as safe as if you were inside the house. Experts recommend taking a break when you're at your wits end with a baby that won't stop crying for no immediate reason. It won't cause any long term harm & shaken baby syndrome often occurs when a parent can't or won't walk away from a crying baby when they're frustrated & exhausted.

Reach out to your doctor. Often health insurance offers newborn care, particularly in the case of multiples.\n\nEven if it's just for a couple of hours per day, you need a break. Reach out to friends and family. Reach out to your local college with an early childhood education program. Many colleges with early childhood programs offer sitting, parents as teachers programs, etc for a discount.

You might want to ask your doctor to refer you to a physiologist to evaluate you for port parts depression. \n\nYour fiance needs to get a grip and realize that at some point, 3 crying infants is too much for one person to handle alone. And with multiples, who tend to be born early, they are going to be behind slightly on milestones. \n\nJust know that 8 weeks is about \"breaking point\" for most new parents.

You alone cannot take care of three babies without either them or you suffering mentally from time to time. In your current situation you have to calm yourself by leaving the situation sometimes.

You are doing EXACTLY what you are supposed to do when overwhelmed. Three newborns is a lot to worry about even if that is all you were doing. Sounds like you need more support. \n\nAlso, if hubby and your in laws have such an issue with it, THEY need to step up and help support you with your newborns.", "NTA  How is being outside on the porch any different than being in a different room of the house?  If you went around the block, that would be inappropriate, but outside the door with a monitor?  That's necessary for your sanity.

I just want you to know you\u2019re an amazing Mom. The fact that you\u2019re taking the time out to write this post is an indicator to me that, at the end of the day, all you care about is the wellbeing of your babies. There are two pieces of parenting advice that I always try to remember:\n\n- if you find yourself getting frustrated in the moments that you can\u2019t be a perfect parent, count yourself amongst some of the best. It\u2019s impossible to be perfect; but the fact that you\u2019re trying each and every day means that you\u2019re a committed parent. \n\n- you know best. You\u2019re young, practically a child yourself. At times you won\u2019t feel confident in your abilities. At times, friends and family will impose their views on you. It\u2019s okay to listen to their perspectives. But you\u2019re their Mom, trust your gut. No one in the world wants better for them than you. \n\nMotherhood is going to be the hardest but best thing you\u2019ll ever do. Sending you love from the frontlines!\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nUr home all day with them, you can still see them and hear them. As long as it's only a few minutes at a time, and you're still monitoring them absolutely nta", "NTA. Taking a breather when you\u2019re overwhelmed with babies is recommended. One baby is hard enough, 3 is extremely difficult and most people need a nanny or help when it comes to 3. So unless your fianc\u00e9 wants to pay for a nanny, you get to make the decision when you need a break. They have the monitor and they\u2019re fine. They can work on self soothing for small amounts of time. You can\u2019t hold all of them at once anyway.", "NTA. You can't be with your babies 24/7, you need to eat, sleep, use the bathroom... etc. As long as you had the baby monitor and they were in a safe place where they couldn't harm themselves everything's okay.\n\nIf your husband thinks you are such a terrible mother, then maybe he should try taking care of triplets all by himself.", "NTA, assuming that you\u2019re only stepping away for a few minutes at a time.

It's hard :( it'll get easier as they get older. Maybe ask if the in-laws can help sometimes cause you can't catch a break. I think dad would maybe feel differently if he had to do all the childcare for a week without a break. Don't give up.", "NTA - What you\u2019re doing is preventing shaken baby syndrome. When the caregiver is overwhelmed, you need to step away for a few minutes to collect yourself and *breathe.* Center yourself, calm down, do what you need to do.

Also, you\u2019re raising triplets by yourself?! Where are his parents and why are they not offering to help you?  Girl, you really need help.

It allowed me to do what I needed to do without feeling guilty. And those few minutes really do help in those times when they won't settle.

I don't disagree that an inexperienced mother who has to take care of triplets herself will sometimes have to let them cry, but it's in no way gonna be beneficial to these children. It's **bad** for their development. It does not teach them to self regulate and self soothe. It simply teaches them that even crying their heart out isn't gonna cause anyone to help them. They will stop screaming as much - not because they self regulated, but because they learned that nobody's there for them.\n\n*Edit: This ain't a reply to OP but to the person encouraging people to let babies cry as long as they're full and clean because it's allegedly beneficial to their development.

Or water. Or scroll Reddit for 5 min for cute puppy pictures. Or cry yourself. \n\nYou\u2019re doing wonderful as a mom. In fact, you\u2019re doing the right thing. \n\nOur pediatrician encouraged me to set baby down and walk away sometimes if I was getting stressed or emotional. My OB encouraged me to do the same. You SHOULD put your babies down and walk away so you don\u2019t get too upset. It\u2019s HARD. Newborns and infants are so hard. You have to take care of your needs also.\n\nEvery parenting resource ever says it\u2019s ok to put your baby down and walk away. Every other experienced parent you meet has put their baby down and walked away. \n\nIf you were walking down the street, leaving your property, sleeping, etc. It would be different. But you\u2019re not. You\u2019re right outside your door for goodness sakes - does tour husband think you need to physically have your eyes on the babies 24/7? Do you never leave the room to pee alone? You\u2019re no further from them in the bathroom than you are outside the front door. \n\nYour husband needs some sense knocked into him. It\u2019s is absolutely not sustainable for you to be home alone 24/7 with infant triplets and no help. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s often not sustainable for moms to be home alone 24/7 with ONE infant without help. Honestly, this scenario isn\u2019t very safe for you or your babies either. \n\nIf your husband is so offended by the idea that you need 2 minutes alone, he needs to find someone to help you. His mom can come help one day a week so you can go for a walk and get a nap. He can hire a nanny to help in the afternoons. He can take over on his day off while you leave and go get some fresh air at a park (or\u2026nap lol) \n\nI really wish you the best and I hope you are able to sit your husband down and have a real come to Jesus talk with him about how things are going. You\u2019re not magic. You can\u2019t do this all on your own without help. \n\nAnd hell, you might be kicking absolute ass! Maybe you ARE the best mom on earth and parenting like an absolute PRO.

Your husband is an AH for even going to them about this. This is a marriage/parenting issue. It\u2019s to be worked out between the two of you. Their opinions don\u2019t count. They don\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t get a say. \n\nAnd the fact your in laws are even taking this stance much less being mad at you about it and hounding you, is astonishing. I\u2019d be livid. It sounds like some boundaries around their involvement in your life are needed. \n\nI tried not to comment on your ages, because I don\u2019t want to come off as a crotchety old lady (im in my 30s and have a toddler) but the more I think about it, it is relavent here. \n\nYou are so young. So so young. Your husband too, but 20 is so so young, immature, naive\u2026. Not in a bad way. You just don\u2019t have the life experiences yet. And it makes it really hard to set boundaries and to stand up for yourself. It can be hard to be confident in yourself and be firm with expecting your needs to be met when you\u2019re that young. Add three babies in the mix? Motherhood makes us doubt ourselves so so much. As moms, we are so unfair to ourselves! \n\nBut from an outside perspective OP, this post makes it clear to me you\u2019re doing amazing. You\u2019re a badass of a young woman already. There\u2019s no way I could have done what you\u2019re doing at 20 years old. If you can find ways to build your confidence in yourself i think it would help with setting boundaries and not allowing people to treat your poorly.
