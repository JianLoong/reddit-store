Even if they were crying.\n\nWe go through so much with pregnancy and birth during the early months and it can be overwhelming.\n\nYour husband needs to get you some help or take some time off to stay at home.

Not really sure. It's a bit of a gray area. If you want fresh air you probably ought to take the babies with you in a stroller, or at least have them very close by to the door.\nEdit: I doubt that harm is going to come to them , especially when you have the monitor available and can rush back, but this does seem like a bit of extreme reaction, having to leave the house like that. You may want to seek out therapy, and/or figure out some kind of schedule for taking care of the kids that gives you more time off from looking after them.

In general, unless there is an active way they can help with something, there's not good that will come from complaining about your spouse to your family, as that will stick in their minds moving forward. If he just needed to complain about being frustrated, which is fair, he needs to go to a trusted friend. I hope you can talk to him about how much his family means to you and that him sharing complaints with his parents causes a rift in your relationship. The only reason I could imagine him mentioning this and it being positive would be for him to say, \"Hey fam, OP is getting really overwhelmed during the day. Totally understandable since there are three babies crying! It helps her to step outside for a few minutes for fresh air, but the babies don't love this. It would be really helpful if anyone has some free time one day to go give her a break.\" If they're gonna be mad about it, they can help.\n\nNow, if you were doing something to actually harm the babies and he needed advice or help with that, obviously that's a different scenario.

The fact that you\u2019re taking the time out to write this post is an indicator to me that, at the end of the day, all you care about is the wellbeing of your babies. There are two pieces of parenting advice that I always try to remember:\n\n- if you find yourself getting frustrated in the moments that you can\u2019t be a perfect parent, count yourself amongst some of the best. It\u2019s impossible to be perfect; but the fact that you\u2019re trying each and every day means that you\u2019re a committed parent. \n\n- you know best. You\u2019re young, practically a child yourself. At times you won\u2019t feel confident in your abilities. At times, friends and family will impose their views on you. It\u2019s okay to listen to their perspectives. But you\u2019re their Mom, trust your gut. No one in the world wants better for them than you. \n\nMotherhood is going to be the hardest but best thing you\u2019ll ever do. Sending you love from the frontlines!\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nUr home all day with them, you can still see them and hear them. As long as it's only a few minutes at a time, and you're still monitoring them absolutely nta", "NTA. Taking a breather when you\u2019re overwhelmed with babies is recommended. One baby is hard enough, 3 is extremely difficult and most people need a nanny or help when it comes to 3. So unless your fianc\u00e9 wants to pay for a nanny, you get to make the decision when you need a break. They have the monitor and they\u2019re fine. They can work on self soothing for small amounts of time. You can\u2019t hold all of them at once anyway.", "NTA. You can't be with your babies 24/7, you need to eat, sleep, use the bathroom... etc. As long as you had the baby monitor and they were in a safe place where they couldn't harm themselves everything's okay.\n\nIf your husband thinks you are such a terrible mother, then maybe he should try taking care of triplets all by himself.", "NTA, assuming that you\u2019re only stepping away for a few minutes at a time.

It's hard :( it'll get easier as they get older. Maybe ask if the in-laws can help sometimes cause you can't catch a break. I think dad would maybe feel differently if he had to do all the childcare for a week without a break. Don't give up.", "NTA - What you\u2019re doing is preventing shaken baby syndrome. When the caregiver is overwhelmed, you need to step away for a few minutes to collect yourself and *breathe.* Center yourself, calm down, do what you need to do.

Also, you\u2019re raising triplets by yourself?! Where are his parents and why are they not offering to help you?  Girl, you really need help.

It allowed me to do what I needed to do without feeling guilty. And those few minutes really do help in those times when they won't settle.

If you neglect your own sanity, everyone suffers. \n\nEveryone seems to think moms need to completely sacrifice themselves, but self care is crucial to caring for your kiddos. \n\nI\u2019m in a few different mom groups and all of us talk about how we\u2019ll take a break to cry when it\u2019s overwhelming.

I don't disagree that an inexperienced mother who has to take care of triplets herself will sometimes have to let them cry, but it's in no way gonna be beneficial to these children. It's **bad** for their development. It does not teach them to self regulate and self soothe. It simply teaches them that even crying their heart out isn't gonna cause anyone to help them. They will stop screaming as much - not because they self regulated, but because they learned that nobody's there for them.\n\n*Edit: This ain't a reply to OP but to the person encouraging people to let babies cry as long as they're full and clean because it's allegedly beneficial to their development.

Or water. Or scroll Reddit for 5 min for cute puppy pictures. Or cry yourself. \n\nYou\u2019re doing wonderful as a mom. In fact, you\u2019re doing the right thing. \n\nOur pediatrician encouraged me to set baby down and walk away sometimes if I was getting stressed or emotional. My OB encouraged me to do the same. You SHOULD put your babies down and walk away so you don\u2019t get too upset. It\u2019s HARD. Newborns and infants are so hard. You have to take care of your needs also.\n\nEvery parenting resource ever says it\u2019s ok to put your baby down and walk away. Every other experienced parent you meet has put their baby down and walked away. \n\nIf you were walking down the street, leaving your property, sleeping, etc. It would be different. But you\u2019re not. You\u2019re right outside your door for goodness sakes - does tour husband think you need to physically have your eyes on the babies 24/7? Do you never leave the room to pee alone? You\u2019re no further from them in the bathroom than you are outside the front door. \n\nYour husband needs some sense knocked into him. It\u2019s is absolutely not sustainable for you to be home alone 24/7 with infant triplets and no help. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s often not sustainable for moms to be home alone 24/7 with ONE infant without help. Honestly, this scenario isn\u2019t very safe for you or your babies either. \n\nIf your husband is so offended by the idea that you need 2 minutes alone, he needs to find someone to help you. His mom can come help one day a week so you can go for a walk and get a nap. He can hire a nanny to help in the afternoons. He can take over on his day off while you leave and go get some fresh air at a park (or\u2026nap lol) \n\nI really wish you the best and I hope you are able to sit your husband down and have a real come to Jesus talk with him about how things are going. You\u2019re not magic. You can\u2019t do this all on your own without help. \n\nAnd hell, you might be kicking absolute ass! Maybe you ARE the best mom on earth and parenting like an absolute PRO.

Your husband is an AH for even going to them about this. This is a marriage/parenting issue. It\u2019s to be worked out between the two of you. Their opinions don\u2019t count. They don\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t get a say. \n\nAnd the fact your in laws are even taking this stance much less being mad at you about it and hounding you, is astonishing. I\u2019d be livid. It sounds like some boundaries around their involvement in your life are needed. \n\nI tried not to comment on your ages, because I don\u2019t want to come off as a crotchety old lady (im in my 30s and have a toddler) but the more I think about it, it is relavent here. \n\nYou are so young. So so young. Your husband too, but 20 is so so young, immature, naive\u2026. Not in a bad way. You just don\u2019t have the life experiences yet. And it makes it really hard to set boundaries and to stand up for yourself. It can be hard to be confident in yourself and be firm with expecting your needs to be met when you\u2019re that young. Add three babies in the mix? Motherhood makes us doubt ourselves so so much. As moms, we are so unfair to ourselves! \n\nBut from an outside perspective OP, this post makes it clear to me you\u2019re doing amazing. You\u2019re a badass of a young woman already. There\u2019s no way I could have done what you\u2019re doing at 20 years old. If you can find ways to build your confidence in yourself i think it would help with setting boundaries and not allowing people to treat your poorly. Your husband should be COMMUNICATING with you if he\u2019s uncomfortable with a parenting choice. \n\nIt\u2019s not wrong of him to be uncomfortable in the moment, but he should NOT be yelling at you and involving family members. \n\nIn a loving and supportive partnership, if he came home to his wife sitting outside the front door with the baby monitor just trying to get some fresh air while the babies cry 15 feet away inside\u2026\u2026 His first instinct should be \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?
