That is so not an age appropriate way of saying don't steal. \n\nThe children are honestly the only ones I see as innocent, one just didn't want her stuff stolen and the other was just believing what his mom told him was ok.", "This is why you never call the cops for nonviolent crimes \n\nVirtually guaranteed to escalate way beyond what is reasonable. Relative stole your video game? Let's send armed adults to lie to and threaten her 6yo. Jfc", "I'm willing to wager she shoved or body checked one of them after verbally abusing them.  Depending on their state, just cussing a cop out is illegal.", "this. i can\u2019t believe how many people are going after the six year old for stealing and saying he needed to be scared straight. he is SIX. six year olds think they are the main characters of the universe and that they deserve to own the toys they want. it is a completely normal phase of child development and is gradually corrected with good parenting. the six year old\u2019s mom is evidently not making any effort to grow him out of this stage, but that isn\u2019t the kid\u2019s fault and it certainly doesn\u2019t warrant a call to the cops. ffs. \n\nOP must live in a small town where the cops have nothing to do and nobody to power trip over except kids, cuz if you tried to call the cops for this shit in my city they would never even show up.", "That\u2019s what I was leaning toward. While I think the kid is too young to be an AH, it doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be a brat. But brats can learn and can grow up to be better people. He\u2019s so young, he can\u2019t be malicious. He just thought \u201cI want this. My mom let me have it. It\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\nI also was surprised that OP was going to use the police in *that* way. Kids look up to authority figures at that age. Could have been a way, way better experience to just have the cops talk to him like a buddy and explain why he shouldn\u2019t take things from people. He probably would\u2019ve left that experience actually learning a valuable lesson. Now the poor thing is struggling to sleep. Threatening to arrest a child? Mind boggling.\n\nI would\u2019ve doubted this story, but I had something very similar happen to me as a kid. Cousin switched out our video game console for a broken one. We snuck in their room later and took it back. They accused us of stealing and got the whole family involved. \n\nSome relatives to this day still remember that side of the story. Ridiculous.", "Thank you! First reply I've seen that points out that Kara did something that could've gotten her busted.  Now,  call it right or wrong but I have heard of officers telling kids,  not tens but kids,  that if they break the law they will go to jail.  \n\nI have to ask,  is what really terrified him the officers alone or whatever his mother did as well because I can't think of any situation where someone almost got arrested for what this is sounding like and they weren't yelling at the officers and having to be yelled at back. \n\nAll around,  legally, it was within OP's right to report stolen property,  and I think Kara's soon will need therapy for a *lot* of things,  if not now then in the future and likely all because of his mom.  \n\nNta", "I haven\u2019t seen anyone point out the \u201cinsult\u201d was also incredibly racist. Kara sounds like a winner all the way through!", "This!!!!", "Agree, this is all on mom.", "Yes, this. Damn, I haven't hears that crap since the early 80's when I was in elementary. \nI had forgotten about it.   It's best forgotten.", "I didn\u2019t even know this one, had to read up on it. Oh, man, that woman deserves all the police. And maybe this way the son will see that he shouldn\u2019t follow his mother. I am sorry he got scared, but not sure what else OP could have done \ud83e\udee3", "Yeahan. And it's inaccurate too. We didn't break the treaties.", "I hate the cops. Absolutely hate them. But this is the stuff \"peace officers\" are SUPPOSED to deal with.\n\nThings like petty theft, disagreements between neighbors, noise complaints, etc, frequently escalate to violence. The idea is that just having an officer standing there to mediate for 5 minutes is often enough to defuse shit. The cops shouldn't be shooting anyone. Just saying, hey, these are the rules. Follow them, or face the consequences. And it sounds like that's exactly what they did.\n\nIn this case, his SIL should have said \"oh, yeah, looks like my 6 year old did a 6 year old thing. I'll bring him over tomorrow morning to give it back and apologize.\" Everything after she failed to do that was on pretty much on her. Including any trauma the kid has from talking to a cop, because she's the one that pushed everything into that escalation.", "Get out of here with this.\n\nWhen I was young, I stole candy from a grocery store. They \u2018called the cops\u2019 on me after my mom brought me back to the store and made me apologize. I also had to tell them I\u2019d work off the cost of the candy bars by cleaning until I earned enough to pay for them instead of just taking them. It was like 2 candy bars and back then they were maybe $.50\n\nAnyway. The police officer came and told me what would happen if I got caught stealing again. And going to jail was a possibility. Heck, I didn\u2019t know, I was young.\n\nWant to know what happened? I DIDNT TAKE ANYTHING AGAIN WITHOUT CHECKING WITH MY MOM, OR PAYING FOR IT.\n\nThere was no \u2018oh, I\u2019m scarred for life now\u2019 \n\nI learned that it was most definitely NOT OK to take things without paying for them, or checking with my mom first.\n\nUnfortunately in this case, the boys mom apparently doesn\u2019t know right from wrong, but hopefully with someone responsible telling and showing him the right thing, he\u2019ll take away something and put it to future use. \n\nThere\u2019s absolutely NOTHING WRONG with having someone lay out possible future consequences to a kid, even if he\u2019s six. I actually have a six year old boy, and would welcome someone other than myself or his dad teaching/telling him about consequences. Just because they do something wrong doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end of the world. That\u2019s the best times to talk to them about what happened and what to do / not do the next time. They are six, not stupid.", "This is partly speculation, but if the officer was calmly telling the child about the consequences of stealing, then I think that's fine. But it sounds like the mom tried to get gully with the officer & things got a bit escalated. The mom actually has some major character flaws & unfortunately, she is raising this child. So that interaction with the officer probably was scary, but hopefully in a good way to mitigate the values that his mom is showing him.", "you're blaming the wrong person. the mother stole and used her kid to do it. the police rightfully got involved, boo hoo.", "We only have the moms word for what was said and she obviously escalated the situation with the police. We already know she\u2019s a liar. I would probably say the kid got told stealing is bad and if he keeps stealing he\u2019d end up in jail, either that or they threatened to arrest his mom for the other thing that happened and that\u2019s what upset him.", "That\u2019s the mom\u2019s fault. She could\u2019ve just gave OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s game back.", "So I guess we just let the kid keep the item he stole that is worth several hundred dollars because he is 6?", "Probably not but that\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the fault of the mother of the six year old. When you steal from someone the police get involved. She knows that. She should have given the Switch back when given the chance. Instead she forced OP to get the police involved.", "I was told I would go to jail for so many things as a kid. Sometimes it\u2019s the only real potential repercussion kids see. Clearly it worked.", "Do we even know if the officers said this to the kid?  It seems we are only going on what his wife's sister said.  She's already a thief and lying about being a thief.  I would not put it past her to lie about what the officers said to her and her son.", "It sounds like the sister-in-law did some thing to create a much more dramatic situation when the cops arrived, and that is probably what traumatized the kid. \n\nWhat did she honestly think was going to happen? It\u2019s not like the kid stole a paperback book.", "Gotta be honest and ask, how's this any different from fuck around and find out? Honestly, calling in a favour like this seems pretty softer than actually placing in a police report for stolen property.", "The cop didn\u2019t frighten him. His shitty mother did.", "So its okay to traumatize a 13 yo who had her stuff stolen and is very upset that a FAMILY member stole from her and lied about it, but a 6yo who can and does know the right and wrong of stealing (evidenced by the gift lie) is traumatized after finding out that stealing is a serious crime with serious repercussions? You're pathetic. Fuck around and find out you 6yo little shit! LOL.", "As the parent of a 6 year old this is all kinds of fucked up. Six is YOUNG. The kid probably did think he\u2019d been given the switch, it sounds like it\u2019s his mum who was trying to steal it. ESH except the poor child who has been terrified by police officers abusing their power.", "The kid knows not to steal, mom wasn\u2019t teaching him and was even encouraging stealing from family no less! OP IS NTA", "He's not traumatized for life but he learned a lesson about actions having consequences and about stealing. Sure the cops could have done better by putting more emphasis on the mother's criminal acts and turn the boy's lesson into more of a stern talking and explanation but they actually reacted rather kindly given that they had 2 grounds for arresting the mother (which would have been more traumatising to the child than being told such actions can lead to her being arrested).", "When I was six, I stole a deck of Scooby Doo cards from Walmart. I didn't mean to, I was fucking six, but I liked Scooby Doo and picked them up. I didn't pocket them or anything, literally just walked out with my mom next to me.\n\nWhen she realized that I had them, her reaction was to have the nearest cop handcuff me and put me in his car while I got drove around the block and she waited in the parking lot while I screamed my lungs out. I vividly remember this and I came out somewhat fine.\n\nShe was a very bad mother in many ways and in no way am I saying that this or what OP did was correct, but that kid is fine. I also agree with the person who said that the mother was deflecting by claiming trauma.", "The police were only called because the mother dismissed & encouraged her little angel\u2019s theft by refusing to give the property back.  Any subsequent action taken by the victim to retrieve their stolen property does not make the perpetrator into the victim.  \n\nSix years old or not, he\u2019s a thief.  In a few short years, he\u2019ll be an even bigger/older thief if something is not done.  His mother has proven that she has no interest in correcting this behavior.  So I am very thankful the police spoke to him & hope they scared the hell out of him as much as his mother is claiming that they did.  Maybe he\u2019ll think about that the next time he wants to steal from someone & maybe it\u2019ll lead him to make a better choice.", "He\u2019s probably upset but his mother caused that, not OP.", "Yes lmfao it happened to my sister too after she did something stupid around the same age and after some discussion with my dad, my mom contacted her cop friend to show up and set her straight. Guess what. She laughs about it now. \n\nThe kid will be fine.\n\nOP, NTA.", "6-year-olds don\u2019t have enough understanding of what jail is to be traumatized by the mere mention of it. My friend threatened to send hers to jail for misbehaving and her kid laughed and said she wanted to go.", "Oh come on now, kids aren't *that* fragile. The cop didn't beat up his mom in front of him or wave a gun in his face. They told him if he steals he's going to jail. It takes more than that to traumatize a kid. They're more resilient than you think. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the kid is just fine and the mom is lying to try and guilt trip the OP.", "The Native American community used the term \u201cIndian\u201d as part of the title of the National Museum of the Indian American so I think they are okay with it in that context.", ">Native Americans as a race cheats people\n\nIt's not so much they cheat people but have a different cultural understanding of possession. Traditionally Indians tended to give freely; if you mentioned you liked something they had they would give it to you but by the same token, if they wanted it back it was expected you would give it back as freely as it was offered. Many tribes also believed no person could own land, anymore than someone could own the water or the sky, which is why they gave up territory for such little compensation, historically speaking.", "TIL.

I think the child might be crying out of shame for his gesture maybe more than fear. \n\nI remember the one time I took 2 bottles of silver beads I took 2 bottles of silver balls used for cake decorating from the grocery store where my father had brought me with him. They were so pretty, the first pretty things I saw since many years. I was little, I didn't fully realize this was wrong. I had strictly nothing, not one toy since I was 2\u00bd years old and my mom threw every toy I had in the garbage because I was her scapegoat. She hurt me physically and emotionally as much as she could. She made me live in total isolation. I had nothing pretty in my life and these were like a wonder I felt needed to have.\n\n Through a strike of luck my father who was never home came home and saw these things in my drawer. He didn't punish me. He patiently asked where they came from. Then we went back to the grocery store and he made me put the 2 bottles on the counter. He did it very gently. The cashier didn't scold me either, none of them added to my burn but I felt so much shame at bringing back these 2 bottles of silver cake decorations that it still stings when I remember that moment. I clearly learned a lesson that was beneficial for my whole life even if the shame hurt. \n\nSo the child might have remembered the shame of his gesture too if his dishonest and manipulative mother hadn't added her drama on top of it.\n\nSuch a small child who maybe didn't have many toys maybe lied to his mother about how he got the game. I Nintendo Switch is still worth a good amount of money. It wouldn't have been ok to let him keep the game he took. \n\nBut his mother is a total unethical wreck. She knew the value of the toy. She didn't want to give it back. Would her child have kept it or would she have sold it? She blames others for what her son did, she didn't want to consider that her son might have taken something, she didn't care about right and wrong, she didn't have any empathy for the little girl nor for her son she didn't guide towards an appeasing resolution. \n\nSome understanding of the kid's motives and at the same time not letting him benefit from a gesture that was wrong even if he didn't have the maturity to realize the implications of what he did.\n\nWith a decent mother, maybe he could have been made to bring the toy back to his cousin and apologise for taking it and depriving her of her game station. That would have been right and constructive. Instead, the child is left with his feelings of guilt and shame towards his mother, the policeman, his cousin, etc. And with nothing to resolve these feelings and realizations.", "Sure. He's probably upset but it is a natural consequence. If you steal you go jail.\n\nNormally your parents get to decide consequences when you mess up but this mother didn't.

This is some serious dysfunctional stuff and I feel sorry for the child.", "Seriously! Who uses that phrase?"]}
