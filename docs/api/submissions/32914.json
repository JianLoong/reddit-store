They are (31F), (40F), and (48F). 40F and I are not close to put it lightly. We tolerate each other when we have to. Recently my (5m) nephew who is her (40F) son had a birthday party. The only reason I knew it was happening is because (31f) asked me if I was going. This is about the 5th time (40F) \u201cforgot\u201d to send me an invite to an event. If this was the first time, I would\u2019ve been way more understanding. I ended up not going to the birthday party. Here\u2019s the current issue I\u2019m asking about though. My step dad (66M) called her out after the birthday party and now all of a sudden she\u2019s making sure to message the group chat on Facebook when inviting us to things. She invited me to a Christmas party at her house, and after much thought I decided to decline the invite. I feel like she\u2019s only inviting me to things because she got called out and she doesn\u2019t want me there. My mom (59F) contacted me today and asked me to reconsider and to please attend so I don\u2019t cause any issues. When I explained to her and my stepdad how I felt, they told me that they think she is making an effort and I\u2019m refusing to forgive her. I love my stepdad and he is now upset at me for refusing to go and be the bigger person. I\u2019m just afraid that if I do attend, she\u2019ll think she can continue to be rude to me.

Say you have another party, you\u2019re getting dental work that day, anything so it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re the one being petty. \n\nYes, I know you shouldn\u2019t have to, but on the flip side, there are things that you both have to go to, like holidays with your parents or their birthdays, or the other sisters things, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re avoiding the whole family just because you don\u2019t want to see her. \n\nBetween your whole family there are bound to be many things through the year that you all get together for, so the few of hers you miss won\u2019t be seen as a big deal. She would probably be the only one who notices that you decline only her events. And if she points that out to you or her dad, you downplay it- hers just happen to fall on days that aren\u2019t good for me.", "NTA - your choice as whether to go or not, but you might want to rethink based on future interactions with a SD you are very fond of.  ie:  make a quick appearance at the party and then leaving for another previous invitation.", "NTA\n\nYour step dad is a major problem with the current situation.  He stepped in on your behalf and made everything worse.\n\nHe needs to understand that being invited now isn't enough at all.  She needs to directly apologize for her past treatment of you.\n\nBut I think the underlying issue is that your step sister simply does not consider you family.  This isn't uncommon in so-called blended families.  She may even have some legitimate beef with this dynamic and the history behind it.", "Don\u2019t cause issues?

I\u2019m just afraid that if I do attend, she\u2019ll think she can continue to be rude to me.\n\nWe train people how to treat us. You might consider going but if she is rude to you in the slightest, get up and leave. And don't be quiet about it.  On your way out, you can say to your parents, \"See, this is exactly what I was telling you about. This is why I was hesitant to be here.\"\n\nA couple instances of this might make your stepsister think twice about how she's treating you, especially with your parents there in witness.", "NTA.

Why would you want to go to her home and be uncomfortable?   And what issues would you be causing exactly just by declining?  Yes, step dad may want all the family there and maybe for that reason, I would have an adult conversation (even in this case, text message would be ok), and say \u201chey, step sister, I know we do not have a great relationship and probably never will, and I understand you feel you might have to invite me to things because of step dad, but I think he would love it if we were all together or at least appear to be together for your Christmas party.  Do you mind if I come for this event? We can say a howdy do and then find other ways to not necessarily co-mingle throughout the evening, wadda ya say?\u201d  Or step dad and mom should have something at their home if they want all to attend.  But no matter what, do what you are comfortable with.  Because let\u2019s face it, she is not making an effort.  She is doing it for her dad.", "You\u2019re 10 years apart so you didn\u2019t exactly grow up together. You don\u2019t have to be besties. Why does anyone care if you go? \n\nNTA", "NTA. *You* aren't the cause of any issues. And an invitation at this point is like a back handed compliment. It isn't designed to correct the errors of the past. Its designed to shine more light on an old issue. \"I'm nice to everyone! Stop picking on me!\" is all your stepsister is saying in the group chat.\n\nSo do what the rest of us do and drop out of the group text.

Sometimes it feels like a barrel of monkeys and - just no thanks.)\n\nTell your mom, \"My calendar isn't fixed yet. But, thanks for reminding me.

Your dad called out her bad behavior.  She changed the behavior and you still are not satisfied.  Based on your current logic, nobody can EVER be forgiven.  You go to the party and if she is rude, then you decline the next invitation.  If being treated rudely at a Christmas party is the worst thing that ever happens to you, then you are a charmed person.  You have to give people the opportunity to be forgiven, or should no one forgive you for any of your mistakes?", "ESH. She sucked for initially excluded you and you claim to be upset about that, she purposely starts to include you to correct past behavior and now you're not going just to be petty.", "NTA. Go and be the bigger person. The second she starts getting rude leave and you are free and clear to not go back again.", "ESH. Neither of you like each other, so why is there an issue about not inviting you to HER parties? She's completely within her rights to not have someone she doesn't like or consider family around her and her kids. So, yes, the only reason she invited you now is because she got bitched at and probably got told to be the bigger person. \n\nEither go and equally be the bigger person or stfu and leave her and her family the hell alone.\n\nOr let me put it in a petty way: If you go and she's even remotely an asshole to you, you win. You can prove your point and have carte blanche to never deal with her again. If you don't go, she can go to the family and prove that she was the bigger person and you were the bad guy all along. She wins.", "Hello, I\u2019m not trying to stand up for myself and claim I\u2019m 100% right. But I wanted to give a bit more background. First thing is that I have tried the entire time she had been my step sister to be polite to her and her family, talk to her, invite her to things, etc. I wanted to get along with her because she\u2019s my step sister, but it just never happened which I don\u2019t blame either of us for. I have tried being a part of her kid\u2019s lives, but as a commenter did point out she has a right to not want me around them. I also wanted to state that I never asked my stepdad to say anything to her, that is something he did on his own. I even asked him and my mom to please change their minds when they decided not to go to the nephew\u2019s birthday party after how they treated me because I didn\u2019t want the kid to be punished for what his mom did. I actually didn\u2019t even want to tell them I wasn\u2019t invited to the birthday party, but my step sister (31f) told them before I could ask her not to. I also was planning on making an excuse and not telling (40f) the real reason I wasn\u2019t going, but I wanted some insight first. I appreciate all the advice I have gotten so far. To those who are asking why it would upset me if we don\u2019t get along to begin with, it is because I was hoping to have a great relationship with her kids which never happened.", "Just think of her as supplying a venue\n Go for the rest of the family.
