{"id": 13312, "submission_id": "123lqej", "title": "AITA for telling my sister I won't talk her kids into anything?", "selftext": "My sister has two children Reese (9f) and Skye (8m). My sister lost her husband and the kids lost their dad 3 years ago. My sister has now met someone else. His name is David. And she is marrying David in June. David has a 4 year old son James. James' mom passed away I believe. My sister and David decided they wanted to include the kids in the wedding somehow, and really show off the uniting of the two families. So they wanted to have all three kids standing with them for part of the ceremony and have James in the middle to show Reese and Skye accepting him as their brother. David said it's sort of like a protective and loving act by standing united with his hands in theirs. They also wanted to walk down the aisle holding hands with the kids.\n\nReese and Skye have said they do not want to do this. They have told their mom they want to just sit during the wedding. They don't want to hold James' hand or be part of the wedding. My sister attempted to talk them into it. She asked them why, they said they just don't want to take part in the wedding, they admitted they're not excited about the wedding. She wanted to know why and they told her they miss their dad, wish he was here instead and it's weird seeing her get married. She told them how much it would mean to her and how James will be their brother after the wedding and how it would be something they look back on fondly. She also told them they might consider David to be a second dad one day and regret not holding his hand down the aisle as their new dad. They said they wouldn't ever see David as their dad.\n\nMy sister came to me and asked me to talk to the kids. I did. They admitted they wish their mom wasn't getting remarried, admitted they don't love David or James, they don't really know how they feel but they don't think they want them as a dad and brother. When asked why they don't really know. Just that they can't imagine feeling that way about them, especially David. They essentially want to get the wedding over with and not have a big deal made. I empathized with them and told them it was okay to be feeling weird and maybe try telling their mom how they feel.\n\nMy sister wasn't happy with me just talking to the kids. She said she and David had failed to talk them into it and so had David's parents. She told me I should try and that someone needs to get through to the kids. That she doesn't want it to look like they're being forced. I told her I didn't feel comfortable forcing this on them and she shouldn't want to force it either. I suggested she talk to the kids and help them with all the changes and the mixed feelings they have. She told me I was being very unhelpful and should be doing more as her sister.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679920563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123lqej/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_wont_talk_her_kids/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is being a huge AH by ignoring her kids feelings and putting her own first. Forcing an unwanted family relationship on grieving kids is absolutely going to backfire on her.", "NTA\n\nIf she forces the kid to do this, they will pull even further away from step sibling and step dad.  Very bad idea.", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing. SOMEONE should be listening to those kids. Ideally, their mom would, but since she's not, they are lucky you've been there for them.\n\nIn terms of the kids' feelings about this marriage, she has no idea what she's doing.", "NTA if showing a united family is so important to them then wait until the kids are comfortable before getting married.", "NTA. Those kids sounded like they needed someone to actually listen to their feelings rather than have their mother ignore them. You did a good thing by letting them open up OP. Trying to force them to do something they're uncomfortable with in front of an entire extended family will probably become a bad memory for them rather than a happy one, as they seem to still be grieving.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister and her soon to be husband should be putting money towards therapy for the kiddos instead of the wedding.", "NTA and they\u2019re both being insensitive and unreasonable. Getting married while your kids are uncomfortable with it is one thing, attempting to force them to participate is a whole other thing. They need to start seeing their children as individual people instead of props to use in their own happiness.\n\nForcing them to participate will only serve to damage their family relationship. It\u2019s only going to push them into resentment.", "NTA. Forcing them to do this will probably push them further away. Frankly, if appearing to be a 'united family' is so important to them then they should wait until the kids are comfortable.", "NTA I think that they all should go to therapy. There is going to be big mess if they will be forced to play big happy family. Your sister is going to put rs with her daughters in jeopardy over 15 min picture-worthy circus. I would say that when she looks back in 10-15 years she would regret that she pushed so hard for her selfish reasons.", "Nta, they are obviously still grieving & her attempting to force any new relationships of any sort is just going to end up badly. She needs to understand that although she's moved forward, their journey isn't hers and they are allowed to feel that way. The best thing they can all do is let things move organically before permanent damage is caused.", "NTA\n\nThey're not your kids. It's not your duty to somehow magically make them change their feelings. Losing a parent and remarrying is one of the most jarring things a kid has to go through.\n\nSister, however, is trying to force her kids to do something they clearly don't want to do. She should have a sit down talk with them and try to understand their feelings as opposed to trying to have you do her job for her. Pretty gross behavior on her part.", "You\u2019re NTA but your sister is pushing the line. Poor kids!", "NTA\nAttempting to force a relationship is a very good way to destroy any chance of it existing.", "NTA but your sister sure sounds like one.\n\nIn the face of the kids refusing multiple people her response is to look for even more people to \"get through\" to them.\n\nRather than hearing no and changing her plans accordingly she clearly intends to force the kids to comply as she's only concerned about them not looking like they're being forced.\n\nPutting aside the piss poor parenting of it all, she must realise that the Instagram moment she's trying for is never going to happen even with children who are willing. They are going to get bored pretty damn quickly and ruin her vision. She would be better off just trying to recreate the moment in the photos afterwards.", "NTA and your sister is well on her way to alienating her children.  She needs to stop pretending this is going to be a perfect blended family and actually listen to her kids for once. They may be a lot more accepting if their feelings and needs were being considered. \n\nOr just get the kids t-shirts that say Team Dad for the ceremony.", "NTA.\n\nAll your sister wants is the perfect picture and is willing to steam-roll her own children in order to get it. And she\u2019s employing flying monkeys on her own young children in order to fulfill her narcissistic vision. She is nuking her chances at getting what she wants by forcing what she wants, and those poor kids will pay for it.", "NTA. The way your sister is going about this is so wrong.\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t be trying to \u201ctalk them into\u201d anything. She and her fianc\u00e9 are more worried about this stupid wedding than children who are likely still traumatized-including his own son.", "She doesn\u2019t want it to look forced as she literally forces them to do it. \n\nNTA.  I get that she\u2019s excited to find love and a new family but she\u2019s really failing her original family in real time.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your sister is taking out her frustrations about the situation on you.\n\nHer kids are still grieving and they clearly aren't ready for this. She is. And it's hard to say what's best; I will say that if the kids aren't comfortable then maybe they should postpone the wedding and seek counseling for the kids both with and without their mother & David.\n\nThis sucks for everyone but they're clearly not okay and forcing this will just be bad.", "NTA - Poor kids , they are in pain and they mom should listen to them and dont invalided their feelings", "NTA.\n\nShe's doing her kids dirty by disregarding their feelings.  She seems to only care about her own happiness.
