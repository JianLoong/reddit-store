My sister lost her husband and the kids lost their dad 3 years ago. My sister has now met someone else. His name is David. And she is marrying David in June. David has a 4 year old son James. James' mom passed away I believe. My sister and David decided they wanted to include the kids in the wedding somehow, and really show off the uniting of the two families. So they wanted to have all three kids standing with them for part of the ceremony and have James in the middle to show Reese and Skye accepting him as their brother. David said it's sort of like a protective and loving act by standing united with his hands in theirs. They also wanted to walk down the aisle holding hands with the kids.\n\nReese and Skye have said they do not want to do this. They have told their mom they want to just sit during the wedding. They don't want to hold James' hand or be part of the wedding. My sister attempted to talk them into it. She asked them why, they said they just don't want to take part in the wedding, they admitted they're not excited about the wedding. She wanted to know why and they told her they miss their dad, wish he was here instead and it's weird seeing her get married. She told them how much it would mean to her and how James will be their brother after the wedding and how it would be something they look back on fondly. She also told them they might consider David to be a second dad one day and regret not holding his hand down the aisle as their new dad. They said they wouldn't ever see David as their dad.\n\nMy sister came to me and asked me to talk to the kids. I did. They admitted they wish their mom wasn't getting remarried, admitted they don't love David or James, they don't really know how they feel but they don't think they want them as a dad and brother. When asked why they don't really know. Just that they can't imagine feeling that way about them, especially David. They essentially want to get the wedding over with and not have a big deal made. I empathized with them and told them it was okay to be feeling weird and maybe try telling their mom how they feel.\n\nMy sister wasn't happy with me just talking to the kids. She said she and David had failed to talk them into it and so had David's parents. She told me I should try and that someone needs to get through to the kids. That she doesn't want it to look like they're being forced. I told her I didn't feel comfortable forcing this on them and she shouldn't want to force it either. I suggested she talk to the kids and help them with all the changes and the mixed feelings they have.
