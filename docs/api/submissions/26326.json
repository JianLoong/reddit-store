To be fair at first the money was rolling in, he was often doubling, tripling and even quadrupling the money he \u201cinvested\u201d but as we all know now it was all an elaborate Ponzi/Pyramid scheme and like all get rich scheme\u2019s it all crumble\u2019s down at the end. But Micheal continued to pretend things were going well and then my sister was pregnant with baby number three and was made redundant as covid lockdowns started, which meant he could no longer pocket my sisters wages to keep trying to recoup the money lost on his \u201cinvestments\u201d. He then stopped paying the mortgage and used his wages and credit cards to desperately try to get back the money he wasted on being a genius business savy alpha. And as luck would have it in this time period laws were put into effect from evicting people. Then it was lifted and the banks came to collect. They moved in with me in my small 2 bed apartment and it was hectic with 3 adults, two toddlers and a baby, they stayed with me for 3 months (had to give decent time to my tenants to move out before I could move them in). We agreed they\u2019d pay reduced rent for the apartment and I had my lawyer draw up the paper work. \n\nHe paid his rent and all was well for a few months. Then he suddenly stopped working saying he was depressed. My sister continued working and paying the bills. He then got another job and quit after a few months. Again stating depression and anxiety. Just to be crystal clear I seriously doubt he\u2019s depressed and if he really is he refuses to do anything about it as I have given him many opportunities to see mental health professionals as I\u2019d be happy to pay. He just wants to play games, talk shit online and find \u201cways to make money\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve had it and I told him he needed to pay rent or move out. He said that my sister was already paying it but I told him that he needed to be working as I agreed to reduced rent if both adult parties were working. Since he isn\u2019t upholding his end of the bargaining I\u2019ve started the eviction process.\n\nMy sister is upset but she understands my frustrations and in many ways agrees with me as she is also fed up with his bullshit but unfortunately my sister loves this man deeply.\n\nMicheal is crying to everyone who would listen to him including our mother and my bum ass father. Who have both been saying I am destroying a family and should be ashamed of myself. To be honest I don\u2019t really listen to my parents because they\u2019re kind of stupid but having told two co-workers of the situation. They\u2019re saying I\u2019m being a bit of an asshole and putting a husband and wife against each other as well as causing my brother in law to move in with his parents and so be separated from his family since there is no way for them to find affordable housing at the moment. \n\nHave I gone too far?\n\nEdit for clarity- My sister and the children will be able to remain at the apartment.

It was good of OP to rent the apartment to his sister's family at a decreased rate, but does that give him the right to exert this level of oversight and control of his adult sister's family?
