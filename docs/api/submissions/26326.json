To be fair at first the money was rolling in, he was often doubling, tripling and even quadrupling the money he \u201cinvested\u201d but as we all know now it was all an elaborate Ponzi/Pyramid scheme and like all get rich scheme\u2019s it all crumble\u2019s down at the end. But Micheal continued to pretend things were going well and then my sister was pregnant with baby number three and was made redundant as covid lockdowns started, which meant he could no longer pocket my sisters wages to keep trying to recoup the money lost on his \u201cinvestments\u201d. He then stopped paying the mortgage and used his wages and credit cards to desperately try to get back the money he wasted on being a genius business savy alpha. And as luck would have it in this time period laws were put into effect from evicting people. Then it was lifted and the banks came to collect. They moved in with me in my small 2 bed apartment and it was hectic 3 adults, two toddlers and a baby, they stayed with me for 3 months (had to give decent time to my tenants to move out before I could move them in). We agreed they\u2019d pay reduced rent for the apartment and I had my lawyer draw up the paper work. \n\nHe paid his rent and all was well for a few months. Then he suddenly stopped working saying he was depressed. My sister continued working and paying the bills. He then got another job and quit after a few months. Again stating depression and anxiety. Just to be crystal clear I seriously doubt he\u2019s depressed and if he really is he refuses to do anything about it as I have given him many opportunities to see mental health professionals as I\u2019d be happy to pay. He just wants to play games, talk shit online and find \u201cways to make money\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve had it and I told him he needed to pay rent or move out. He said that my sister was already paying it but I told him that he needed to be working as I agreed to reduced rent if both adult parties were working. Since he isn\u2019t upholding his end of the bargaining I\u2019ve started the eviction process.\n\nMy sister is upset but she understands my frustrations and in many ways agrees with me as she is also fed up with his bullshit but unfortunately my sister loves this man deeply.\n\nMicheal is crying to everyone who would listen to him including our mother and my bum ass father. Who have both been saying I am destroying a family and should be ashamed of myself. To be honest I don\u2019t really listen to my parents because they\u2019re kind of stupid but having told two co-workers of the situation. They\u2019re saying I\u2019m being a bit of an asshole and putting a husband and wife against each other as well as causing my brother in law to move in with his parents and so be separated from his family since there is no way for them to find affordable housing at the moment. \n\nHave I gone too far?\n\nEdit for clarity- My sister and the children will be able to remain at the apartment. The only one being evicted is Micheal.", "created_utc": 1694016174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bo3ji/aita_for_starting_the_process_to_evict_my_brother/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's a lazy, entitled shit who mooched off the entire family until everyone but his mom cut him off. Now my GF is \"dead to him\" because she won't give him money. After they finally let him become homeless, he went and got a job. He's still a long way from okay, and the first thing out of everyone's mouth when talking about the useless brother is: \"Don't give him money!\" The guy is 40 years old and has the mentality of a petulant 12-year-old.\n\nYour BIL won't get better if others keep solving HIS problems.", "Your sister needs to learn she can love somebody \u201cdeeply\u201d - and still be sick of their shit. \n\nNTA for still housing your *sister*.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t hear any offers for anybody else to take in the whole family?

But BIL keeps quitting jobs when his family needs his paychecks to recover from his foolish \"investments.\" Yet he refuses to work, spending all day gaming and looking for get-rich-quick schemes. That was not the agreement, it was never the plan nor my responsibility to support him, and he needs to find work if he wants to live with his family. If he chooses not to, he only has himself.to blame. My decision is final, and I will not be discussing this with you further.\"", "NTA.  Also, they should move in with your parents.  Seriously, your sister could move in with them until she could figure out a way ahead. Michael needs to grift in a new location.", "NTA.  And as someone with several people in my life who suffer from mental illness, it infuriates me when people claim to have one as an excuse to get their own way.

Michael is a parasite that is going to keep draining resources from your sister and Niblings.", "NTA.\n\nIf you continue to have him live with you without consequences, he'll just keep doing this over and over and over again. Throwing crap at a wall and hoping to see what will stick is not a good career path as you get older and have more responsibilities, didn't you say he has THREE KIDS now?\n\nIf you start the process, and he sees that he pretty much has to shape up or pretty much be on the street, he will shape up hopefully.", "NTA...What's the end game here if you don't evict him?
