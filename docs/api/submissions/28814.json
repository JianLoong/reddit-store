I obviously dress up for the occassion, however, a lot of the partners of his colleagues and his female colleagues really, really dress up. I might show up wearing a dress from Reiss - which to me is still extremely fancy, but they'll be there in Balenciaga or other very expensive clothes.\n\nRecently my boyfriend asked if I'd consider buying something like that for an event we were going to (an evening awards ceremony). It was just one night and it was very fancy, so I agreed and spent an eye-watering amount of money on a dress.\n\nSince then he's asking if I'd consider doing this for every event I go to. I said it's a waste of money and I'm not going to spend thousands on clothes and shoes, but that every once in a while I'm happy to splash out. I also said if he's happy to buy it then I'll wear it, but otherwise I'd rather spend my money on other things. He doesn't like that idea because we've never had that kind of a relationship, and he said it would feel like our dynamic was changing if he started buying me stuff like that - like we're not equal partners - which I totally understand because I would feel the same.\n\nI personally feel like he wants me to wear this sort of stuff because we don't come from this lifestyle, and he feels like he has something to prove (although he won't admit that).

You legends, thank you!**\n\n**Edit 2: Thanks for all your feedback guys, I think I'll take the \"discuss the price\" with him option and talk him through how much it would all actually cost, then maybe look at renting.** \n\n**I get where the people calling him an arsehole are coming from, but he's not - I think it's just imposter syndrome (which I get because I feel the same way).

Designer is costly, you wear it maybe once or twice, and then it gathers dust. Him? He can rotate a few suits, and change the look with the tie and pocket square. \n\nNTA. \n\nDoes he understand exactly how much designer costs? He\u2019s expecting you to bear the financial burden in order to look good for his events. I\u2019d say his request has changed the dynamic. He\u2019s in finance, I\u2019m assuming he understands numbers. Write it all down: the cost of a few suits and accessories that can be worn frequently, and the costs of a new dress and accessories for each event. Show him his costs are tiny in comparison to what he wants you to spend. \n\nPS - maybe try rent the runway? Or thrift stores? Consignment stores?", "NTA. Your job is to dress appropriately for the dress code of the event, not spend thousands to keep up with his co-workers\u2019 partners. \n\nIf he wants you to wear clothing that is out of your budget, he needs to be willing to pay for them. Also, I\u2019m guessing if he asked, most of his co-workers are footing the bill for their dates\u2019 ensembles.", "NTA. You're being completely reasonable! Does your boyfriend seriously expect you to pay for stuff HE WANTS?? He makes more than you and if he really wants it he should pay for it. He's probably embarrassed that you're not wearing super expensive clothing like the other women there and he wants you to fit in.", "NTA\n\nhonestly, you are not equal partners, as he makes you spend money on his behalf basically. \n\nNow if you truly enjoy the name-brand clothing and want to buy it for yourself then ok , but to ask you to buy it for an event if absolutely crazy. \n\nI know you two have a lot of history so this seems trivial now, but honestly have a talk about your finances going forward. I imagine you are thinking about this relationship being permanent at this point? If so, you need to sort this out because the fact is, your salaries are very very different, that it a reality and can't be disregarded. \n\nOP I really really do hope for your sake, that he's just a bit slow and does not realize how big of a deal are those demands in regard to your salary, cause that can be easily fixed. IF he does realize, then he's slowly changing into a huge AH and I am afraid that one cannot be fixed.", "NTA the expensive clothes are for his benefit, not yours. Even if you'd be the one wearing them, they're being bought for him, his reputation and his insecurity. If he doesn't like what you're wearing he should be the one to pay for it.", "His reasoning that the dynamic of your relationship would change if he bought you a dress makes no sense, he\u2019s changing the dynamic by asking you to spend more on clothes to impress whoever. NTA he should WANT to treat you if he has more money and it\u2019s his events you\u2019re attending. Gosh he needs to give his head a wobble", "NTA\n\nThis behavior is referred to as \"Keeping up with the Joneses\"\n\nThat is, trying to match the spending and lifestyle of others to impress them\n\nDont get sucked into this way of being", "No your are nta and the title does not make you sound like one either. It is not unreasonable to noteantto spend that kind of money, and if he really cares then he should be willing to pay for it himself. It is not your job to please others. I came fro. Low income, and I am still in low income. I have met some snobby people who talk down on me for not wearing fancy enough clothing. I try to ignore them. In the end it is about how you treat others. Notabout what you wear.", "It costs a lot of money to be a woman and to show up to events like this and look as showy as what some are looking like.\n\nAnd at the same time, it's a huge class signifier, to spend that much on a dress to be worn only once, to go glam, to wear expensive jewelry, even to know how to put together a look. All these things are a function of wealth and status. \n\nHe needs to get real and start paying if he wants to appear to fit in with this crowd. If the woman in his arm is a reflection of his own status, then he needs to pay to get the look. Tell him to give you a budget for a glam event. \n\nAnd give him an itemized option: \nPlan A, buy designer, include shoes and shapewear, see what it costs to get a stylist consult, and a full look from a makeup artist and salon hairstyle. Include cost of waxing and nails. Request jewelry to go with it.\n\nOption B would be the basics to fit in the way he wants: the cost of makeup and hair but a cheaper option like makeup counter, a manicure + a blowout, rent the runway or buy consignment, and re use shoes. \n\nShow him the balance sheet. If he wants a high maintenance date even for a night, he's got to see what high maintenance costs and make it clear you're doing it for him and his networking events.", "NTA- I understand why he wants you to see 'nicer' (more expensive and name brand) clothing, but you aren't wearing trash and as you said you bought a nice expensive dress, its not illegal to wear a dress more than once, and you are wearing relatively nice clothing to these events --- just not as fancy as the other richer people (I cannot for the life of me phrase a sentence in a way that sounds good sorry) and if your bf insists on you wearing something that costs over $1,000 you should not have to pay for something especially if you already have a 1000$ dress- you do not under any circumstances have to spend over 1500$ on a wardrobe so you can ''prove something\" to his peers and if he's doesn't want to at least help pay for it then don't buy it or simply don't go.", "NTA you have your values and he has his. ( I prefer yours). They don\u2019t seem to be aligning here. I don\u2019t know what he expects you to do; he\u2019s an AH if he expects you to pay to keep up appearances for him to impress his coworkers.", "Your attending his events which are for his  business purposes. Does he expect you to subsidise other business activities of his, like pay his petrol money or professional membership fees. He\u2019s a knob, and you are NTA. I\u2019d say if he needs you to attend and dress a certain way one - he\u2019s a massive AH if he\u2019s dictating your clothing and wants you to pay to meet his standard. and two don\u2019t go if you don\u2019t want to invest to meet his requirements,m. Ie darling I\u2019d love to go and hang out with your boring mates and talk shop with you which is little to minor interest to me but frankly I don\u2019t want to pay \u00a32k for the shit night out.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s his work. \n\nIf he cares that much, it\u2019s basically a business expense. He should therefore be paying.\n\nIf the roles were reversed and you were asking him to pay thousands every time you guys went to your work functions, I doubt he would be OK with it.", "It's your money OP.\n\nIf you don't want to spend thousands and thousands trying to impress his colleagues, then don't spend thousands and thousands *trying* to impress his colleagues.  Because, you see, you have no proof that all that money spent is sctually impressing anyone.", "He wants you to spend your money for his benefit. He can pay.", "NTA. He is asking you to spend thousands of dollars on clothes for his functions. No way.", "Can you rent those fancy dresses? And get it to fit especially if it is a one night thing and you\u2019re not likely to rewear them?", "NTA. Reiss dresses (I assume floor length gowns?) are beautiful. I\u2019m a big fan of their products. But if you want something fancier, renting a dress might make more sense. Especially since you\u2019re only going to wear it once.\n\nBut I\u2019m also petty, so you can also suggest to him that if you\u2019re expected to buy new dresses every time you attend a fancy dinner, he can splurge on yet another bespoke tux", "NTA, wear what you like", "I read this in a Yorkshire accent,  was that right? \nAnyway,  plenty of people have advised on this.  Just be wary your boyfriend is not Working Class anymore. Sounds like  he's full finance wanker  now wanting to display his wealth as often as possible. If things start getting difficult between you as he transitions to a Partick Bateman type,  you might have to just let him go before he replaces you with someone more glamorous to impress his friends.", "NTA\n\nHE wants you to dress up and spend money on clothing for HIS work event, so HE looks good with you on his arm. The fact that you rightfully brought up, if he has this request, which is simply down to aesthetics and appearances, then he can pay for them, whether rental or not.\n\nThe fact that he put this expectation on you and refuses to compromise is a bit concerning, is this the first incident in your relationship where he has displayed this attitude/behaviour? I'd definitely say it's worth a proper sit down and open conversation, show him how much a fancy outfit costs (including accessories, hair, nails etc), surely he would see then how ridiculous an ask this is?", "NTA, your dynamic already shifted when he asked you to spend your money to solve his ego problem. I\u2019m guessing most of the plus 1\u2019s at these events are married and sharing finances too. \n\nThis is a problem that can be solved but not if his attitude doesn\u2019t.", "NTA. He wants you to spend *your* money for *him*. Those dresses are not for you. They clothe your body, but they are for *his* events and because *he* wants you to wear them. There is no reason why him buying them should change the dynamic and why you should front the bill.", "You're saying your problem is solved but you have a solution only to part of the problem. \n\nYou and your boyfriend need to work together to reconceptualise his work events. Partners are *allowed* to attend but does your attendance enhance his work relationships/career? If so, then all expenses for your attendance comes from his work budget. You are being a supportive partner by choosing to attend (though if the answer to the question is no, you might choose to stop attending instead).\n\nA comparison from my own relationship where we try to be equal: my partner now has a car allowance with his job. We've made a collective decision not to get a second car for now, so we have agreed that if he needs the car for work, he will pay for my taxis. This won't be a shared expense, it will be a *him* expense, because his job has led to the expense and they pay him accordingly. I know your boyfriend doesn't have a 'dress allowance', but his higher wage does reflect that.\n\nJust stepping back a bit too, you've said you're both not financially motivated. Could you convince him not to go with the status quo of lavish displays of wealth including on his living, breathing girlfriend? You might find yourselves less wealthy than you should be on your incomes if not. (I recommend 'Bonfire of the Vanities', though that is extreme)", "NTA. I get that he might feel he has something to prove to his colleagues but if that's how he feels then yes he should at least like. Split the cost with you even if you rent it. If I ask my partner for something or to go somewhere specifically for my sake? I'm paying. Granted I'm currently the breadwinner in general but like even when she's got an income I wouldn't expect my partner to shell out for events I want her to come to with me. I don't think it makes it less of an equal partnership for him to pay for the things he is requesting. Or at least pay for part of it.", "I'm nobody's expert on clothes but Reiss makes very nice stuff which 99% of the population would consider to be stylish and expensive.\n\nSpending any more - whilst being absolutely fine if you can afford it - serves absolutely no purpose beyond wealth-signalling. Which again is totally fine, if that's your thing, but to the average person it might appear shallow, vacuous and pretentious.\n\nYou seem like your head is screwed on properly.", "NTA - he\u2019s the one with bank money, if he wants you dressed up it\u2019s his bank money that pays for it. It pays for everyone else there to be so dressed at these events he\u2019s joining. He should just consider it a \u201cwork expense\u201d and budget an amount for it if he doesn\u2019t want it to feel like luxurious gifts. It\u2019s important socially that y\u2019all look the part but that does mean he has to pay for it.", "NTA. I usually have a long winded comment following my judgment but you're financially wise and there's not much more to say!", "NTA. Him asking that of you is changing the dynamic because it was never an expectation before. If designer clothes is now the expectation, then he needs to foot the bill or be happy with what you are already doing. I agree with the person who said to do an itemized list of everything required for a designer outfit and show him the comparison of what you would have to get (gown, Jewelry, hand bag, shoes) vs what he would have to get (new tie and pocket square? Possible new shirt?). Once he sees what it takes to be a designer woman he might change his attitude. Also, those other women probably are not paying for that themselves. I bet they either have a shared income with their spouse or the man is paying because it is not common for both in the couple to have well paying jobs for the woman to pay like that completely out of her own pocket. Now I'm not saying that the woman can't be the head of household and be the financial breadwinner, but I do believe it is uncommon in the banking/finance industry. Correct me if I'm wrong here.", "NTA. You have different values. You place other things above 'looking a part'. If he values the latter, then he should pay for it.", "NTA. He should just buy 5 dresses for you and you can rotate them. Or rent as some people have suggested.", "NTA \n\nHey, I\u2019m UK based - rent clothes on Hurr or By Rotation! You can select where there from and how long you want to rent it, we\u2019ll worth it if you\u2019ll never wear it again", "NTA.

It's HIS request. You don't need fancy dresses. He wants you in them.", "NTA He is asking you to fit the cost of his appearance so he should fit the bill. That's my take.", "Just reading the title made me go NTA. You are being rightfully prudent with money.", "NTA, but I see too many people focussing on the money. The change in dynamic is that he is seeing these women as arm candy for their husbands, only present to look pretty and exude wealth. \n\nHe now also wants to look the 'successful rockstar' part with the great looking arm candy. Now if he wants a trophy wife he should be paying for it. But then ... he is attaching your worth to what you wear. \n\nIs that something you, a smart woman with a great career, who is financially savvy, is willing to put up with? \n\nPlease tell me you think higher of yourself than a self-funding accessory. \n\nFeminist rant over.", "I would just wear the same expensive dress you've bought to every event. Just with different accessories. \nI think you need to have a chat about how this expectation of his doesn't match your own values. If you give in to this minor request, what is he going to ask of you next? Next thing, you're not who you are anymore, just playing the role of his arm candy.", "> neither of us are massively financially driven\n\n> he has a very good job at a bank\n\nNot really relevant as to weather or not YT/A, but I genuinely don't think both of those statements can be true at the same time. The skillset required to do a \"good job at a bank\" are better, more healthily and more ethically utilized literally anywhere else, if your motivation is not purely (massively) financial.\n\nI think you might benefit from having a ponder as to what kind of person your partner really is.", "NAH for not wanting to spend money, but if you're underdressing for these events (and it sounds like you are\u2014unfortunately designer clothing is just sometimes part of the dress code) then you should just decline to go.", "YTA\n\nDollars to donuts those dresses are rented and that\u2019s what you should be doing too.", "NTA but for different reasons. You\u2019re an architect and can afford a closet full of Louboutins if you wanted them so the argument that he should buy your clothes is BS. It\u2019s also BS in your favour if you dress smartly but not overly expensively. Good taste doesn\u2019t have a price. On the other hand sometimes it\u2019s not keeping up with the Joneses as one comment wrote it\u2019s a necessary part of the shallow part of business you probably don\u2019t like and thus making it an issue. Sometimes these \u201clittle\u201d things make the difference to a client sometimes not but if your BF is a big swinging dick in the business world esp banking then why not just roll with it what\u2019s the harm and the reward is nice. You\u2019re not claiming any other relationship issues so if this is it, life is good. Calm the fuck down and rock some Loubies once in a while!", "NTA, you could rock up in trackies and he should be happy you've turned up.

Even if you love clothes you might think - I\u2019d much rather spend money on a really great pair of boots I\u2019ll wear a lot than a dress I\u2019ll wear once.", "ESH, not quite AHs but..  ick", "I think the idea of renting dresses is great - and increasingly common where I live. I totally get why you don't want to spend silly money on a dress that you may wear only a very few times.", "NTA I'll take it you are appropriatly dressed for the occasion, just not enough for him to show off.\n\nTell him how much you usually spend with hair, make-up, dress, etc. for his events, ask him how much he spends on your events and tell him that you will gladly support him how you always did, but if HE wants to shift the dynamic by making you dress more to his coworker's wifes standards HE has to financially support you", "NTA.\n\nThere is a whole [Simpsons episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenes_from_the_Class_Struggle_in_Springfield) that's related to this.\n\nBtw OP - I looked at dressed from both companies: the Reiss dresses look very sophisticated. The Balenciaga stuff is very pretentious and try-hard - the models look like they're in The Matrix.", "OP, this actually really pisses me off on your behalf. Ask him if he's willing to spend around $50k yearly on your career. He would never! And you guys aren't married, which is totally fine if that's what you both want, but you have no commitment, protections, but he's asking for this huge financial outlay from you.\n\nTo me, a life partnership or marriage is about being all in. Financially you are living as roommates. Sorry if that sounds harsh.\nI did the same for a long time with my now husband but we worked it out and revised things. You are equals bc you want to be equals and don't resent sharing.", "Ha! I was coming here to suggest renting but then I saw your edit.", "Y'all been together 14 years and he thinks buying you stuff would \"change the dynamic of the relationship\"? What kind of relationship do you have now? NTA", "\"Plus, he goes to events with me and spends hours talking to my colleagues about the difficulties of plumbing in skyscrapers , so I think I we can meet in the middle with this.\"\n\nWhat, you don't do any talking at his events?? I assume you have conversations at his events too, so that doesn't make this an even exchange..", "NTA, Reiss-level clothing is imo a perfectly acceptable level of fancy, most designer stuff is honestly just for status", "You can follow @melissaswardrobe or even @kaicollective or @reniabina or @fisayolonge on instagram, they dress really well and they\u2019re not breaking the bank plus they share recommendations", "If his colleagues are making equal kind of money to him, you can be 90% certain that the men buy those dresses for their spouses, unless the woman is ridiculously wealthy as well (and even then they might). I mean it, the men are paying, and the female colleagues buying themselves if they make the same money.\n\nWhile the dynamic might not be like that in your relationship, you might point out to him that if he wants to fit in with the culture of his colleagues, him paying is actually part of that culture. \n\nOr be smart and rent \u2013 but he should still pay!", "OP, might I suggest you take your partner to one of these fancy dress rental shops and get him to pay for a dress to rent to the next event you both attend. \n\nThis way he has a hands on experience with what he's requesting of you (taking time out of your busy day to go and pick dresses, paying for them, taking them back a day or so later, then doing it all again for the next event).", "YTA. You can afford your own clothes. He should start dressing like he's homeless until you get it together.", "I'd never heard of Rent the Runway or renting in general, I think you might've just solved my problem!", "Yes and he should pay the renting fee lol", "Spot on about the coworkers. \n\nPerhaps those women already own those expensive items themselves, but I'll bet none of them are buying Balenciaga dresses just to wear to their partners' work events. OP's bf wants her to dress up to make *him* look good in front of the coworkers, but refuses to do what his coworkers actually do - footing the bill. OP's expensive clothes can only make him \"look good\" if his coworkers think he's the one paying for them anyway, so he wants to benefit from that assumption without bearing any of the costs. It's embarrassing.", "This.\n\nIf he wants OP to look like the other kept women at the event, he sorta has to start keeping her, doesn't he?", "Slowly changing? He's already an AH!", "This!", "100 percent. They're for him to look good at his job and he should be responsible for them. To me this is a sign of a fairly large problem. It's like that old Dan Savage post someone linked too, where expenses should be shared proportional to income.\n\nAlso, the aren't married, which is fine, but op has no protections/formal commitment yet is responsible for this outgoing for her husband's benefit.\n\nOp, you might not be particularly money focused but your partner is. Why does he have a job in banking and want you to wear incredibly expensive clothes if he's not fairly money focused?", "Exactly. He\u2019s changing the dynamic of the relationship anyway, OP.", "He sounds like an ass. Hope he's paying his *equitable* not equal share.", "My husband and I know a couple like this. \n\nHe use to be on great money, she a bit less, but they spent what I can only imagine to be around 1 million minimum for an old house in a fancy suburb (knocked it down and rebuilt a big house).\n\nHe then lost his job (got another for a lot less pay) she got pregnant (he's about 57m, she's about 40f) and now the interest rates have risen I can imagine they're in quite the pickle. \n\nDon't keep up with the Joneses people!", "This is a bandaid solution. The problem isn\u2019t the dress. The problem is his attitude. If I started earning more I\u2019d definitely share it with my partner because you know that person is your husband/wife and not some roommate. I do not understand this mentality of you go your way I go my way but we are still married and you have to fulfil all responsibilities of being married.", "This is an amazing idea, I didn't even know you could do that!", "Reiss is my favorite. They have such effortlessly gorgeous clothes. But honestly they are expensive!", ">but I genuinely don't think both of those statements can be true at the same time\n\n\nIt's almost as if Op lives in the real world where horses don't fly and where having money is better than not having it, right? \n\n\n>The skillset required to do a \"good job at a bank\" are better, more healthily and more ethically utilized literally anywhere else, if your motivation is not purely (massively) financial\n\n\nPoint still standing. \n\nAlso, YOU keep your money in the ground these days? Cos we wouldn't want people like Op's bf going anywhere near it, right?", "You are totally missing the point. It doesn't matter that OP can afford to buy the designer stuff.  She doesn't want it. OP'S BF doesn't get to decide how she spends her money. If it's really that important to BF, he can pay for it.", ">Sometimes these \u201clittle\u201d things make the difference\n\n\nGood. He shouldn't have a problem paying for these \"little\" things, right?", "Where do you get that she can afford that? It doesn't sound like she can.\n\n\nAnd they aren't HER clients. These aren't HER work events. If HE cares about her clothes impressing HIS coworkers and clients, it should be HIS money that pays for them. \n\n\nHe makes way more than she does, and he obviously doesn't share any of it with her.", "Perhaps the dress aspect, but how he thinks about this situation seems a bit off and that he doesn\u2019t appreciate you / if very caught up in the look of things. Theses are his work events. He wants you to finance his work events when he makes significantly more than you. That is not an equal partnership.", "This doesn't solve your problem. It's a bf problem, not a cost problem.\n\n\nThese fancy clothes are not for YOU, even though you are wearing them. They are for him....his events, his image, his preference. \n\n\n\nThink of someone saying, \"I want you to go a Taylor Swift concert/Super Bowl/whatever with me, even though you aren't a huge fan and have limited interest. Tickets are $1000 and you have to pay for your own.\" Except repeat this over and over. \n\n\n\nDon't give in here just because Rent the Runway is cheaper. He needs to admit this is more for him than for you.", "Get him to pay the rental fee too.", "His attitude is the problem,  not your ability to buy/rent outfits to satisfy his demands.\n\nThink about this. He's treating you like a dress up object.\n\nThis is not your problem to solve.", "He makes more money than you, is asking you to wear expensive clothes for HIS events, and he's getting defensive when you ask him to pay for something he is asking you to do for him?\n\nGirl, you need to rethink this relationship. You've been together 14 years and he can't even handle giving you a nice gift that he is requiring you to have? WTF is that relationship? He's cheap and selfish, two things that dry out my vagina personally.", "You still shouldn\u2019t feel like you have to. I work in the city too - Reis is PLENTY posh enough. I\u2019ve worn H&M dresses to posh dinners - and plenty from asos or charity shops. If you accessorise right and pick the right clothes it looks just as good.\n\nMy boss is my fave - it\u2019s just so unpredictable. Prada boots, \u00a31 ring from a charity shop \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f always looks great though.\n\nIf you actually like the high end stuff Vestiare is good too (bit like Vinted but only high end fashion)", "This is kind of just a band aid solution, no? This is his issue. He should still be the one fronting the bill, or at least helping with the cost", "I did my wedding dress from rent the runway, I even had a coupon so it was a designer gown for 75.00 and they sent it in 2 sizes just to make sure it would fit.  This will solve the problem.", "That's not your only problem.  You have a husband problem.", "PLEASE do not pay the rental fee yourself! it\u2019s his work events and his request that you dress up\u2014you should not be bearing the expenses for that.", "You don't really have a \"problem.\" He's creating a problem and he should be financially responsible for it.", "Rent the runway is nice but you\u2019re not getting Gucci quality you\u2019re getting like Reis level dresses. There are higher end rental ones tho", "I still think that he should pay to rent fancy attire for his events. Otherwise, you have one designer dress that you\u2019ll wear over and over. You\u2019re not refusing to wear appropriate attire, you\u2019re just declining to buy a new dress for each event. And I also don\u2019t think you should have to pay for the rental fee each time when it\u2019s his event\n\nAlso he needs to think about who is paying for the dresses and accessories that other women are wearing. I\u2019m guessing the ones buying the expensive dresses are the one working in finance, regardless of gender. (Women at his workplace buy their own clothes but men are paying for their wives or partners. In summary, his job affords the means to buy expensive dresses. Yours not as much). I think he\u2019s being quite cheap here", "Plus then you're not stuck with a closet full of clothes you never wear. It's much more environmentally friendly. And if you're prone to fluctuations in weight, you always get something that fits. \n\nI would like to hear more about the difficulties of plumbing in skyscrapers though; that genuinely sounds interesting.", "He's not! Not sure why you're being downvoted.", "No doubt, but just a suggestion to sort of compromise for now. the problem might pop up again, or it might not. Who knows.", "I\u2019m in the UK - I used ByRotation to rent a dress for a wedding last summer and would recommend the service.\n\nHurr is another one in the UK that I\u2019ve heard good things about.\n\nTotal life saver for your exact situation\u2019", "> It's almost as if Op lives in the real world where horses don't fly and where having money is better than not having it, right?\n\nYeah, exactly, she lives in the real world where it is entirely possible to live a comfortable and happy life without working for a bank. Working for said bank literally only grants you money. It then logically follows that working for a bank for lots of money means you are \"massively\" financially motivated (massively meaning past a standard deviation of above average financial motivation for people with a similar skillset). OP believes her partner is not massively financially motivated. I'm simply stating I can easily show objectively that he is. I'm not making a value judgement as to weather that's bad or not.\n\nThough, it probably is pretty obvious what my judgement would be, were it my place to make one.", "Exactly. Plus the gift is for him, not for her!\nShe's already spending a large amount of time and effort getting ready and attending these events and he's the one who cares about the fancy clothes, not her.", "Finding designers' stuff second hand is so time consuming tho - the bf should be trolling Vestiare for deals and paying for them himself if he's too stingy to shell out the money for her clothes but then still demanding she wears certain things."]}
