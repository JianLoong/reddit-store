My boyfriend (22m) and I (22f) have been in a relationship for just over a year now. He\u2019s a great man and I\u2019m so in love with him. His only flaw is how attentive he is to his younger cousin, M (15f), I\u2019ve tried to overlook this but just can\u2019t anymore.\n\nIf M calls, no matter the situation, he will run to be there for her. For example, on my birthday, four months ago, M called him crying, saying her and her boyfriend just broke up and she needed him. He ran to be with her, he didn\u2019t even say \u201cI\u2019ll be there in an hour, I\u2019m celebrating my girlfriend\u2019s birthday.\u201d This frustrates me beyond belief, but anytime I asked him if he could just put it off for a little he would get mad at me. M\u2019s parents went through a really messy divorce, parental alienation was involved and she\u2019s been in court ordered therapy. That\u2019s his excuse for leaving me. Every time.\n\nAnother thing is that he\u2019s really, really close to her. I get that she doesn\u2019t have the best relationship with her parents but he literally treats her like his own kid. If she\u2019s over he\u2019ll go above and beyond for her. If she wants to watch a movie they\u2019ll sit together on the couch, mainly with her in his lap.\n\nThe other day, we went out to the movies and she called him again. This time, it wasn\u2019t even anything serious, just that she was doing her homework and can\u2019t figure out the math and was having a panic attack. I begged my boyfriend to just go after the movie was done, but no. He said that he\u2019d call me an uber home and that M would be staying at our apartment for the night. I stayed at the movies and then took an uber home, sure enough, they were cuddling on the couch. This set me off but I didn\u2019t say anything, until she left the next morning to go back to her mom\u2019s house. \n\nThen I asked him. Why do you always do this to me? Why does M\u2019s wants come before mine, every single time? He told me I was being ridiculous. That M is a young girl whose father is not at all present and he has to fill that role. He even went so far as to say that I am jealous because M is a really pretty girl. I don\u2019t even know what looks had to do with it but I felt insulted. Now I feel guilty, M is generally a sweet girl who really seems to like me and I think I\u2019m resenting her for no reason.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1700515821, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zzkuq/aita_for_fighting_with_my_boyfriend_for_being_so/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their relationship sounds unhealthy in other ways too, like they're emotionally enmeshed or something. \n\nAnd regardless of the above, you have valid concerns. If he's doing this to you now, he will continue to do so if you get married and if you decide to have kids. You can't build a life with someone who does not prioritize you. I would have dumped him by now.", "Run for the hills.", "Why is no one pointing out how creepy 'Him calling her pretty' is!!.. as someone filling 'father's' role, calling a 15 year old pretty is weired as F!! OP run for the hills", "NTA\nThat's weird. That would annoy me too. Sounds like it isn't negotiable and you should just break up with him and find someone else.", "NTA. Especially with a teenage girl cuddling on his lap (super inappropriate) and his comment about her being prettier than you, I'm very concerned about his relationship with her. That's not him setting a good example of a father figure. A teenage girl shouldn't be cuddling on the couch with her father, either. The two of you need to set some healthy boundaries, and agree on some ground rules regarding his niece. Things like he doesn't leave in the middle of your time together unless you both agree it's an emergency. She needs to learn patience and respect for his time. No more cuddling or her sitting on his lap. That's not appropriate for a 15-year-old girl and any adult. And you both need to agree on overnight guests; he doesn't just get to decide she's sleeping over without your permission, or her mother's for that matter.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are his SECONDARY girl. He even drops your dates for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnd the relationship, you can do better.", "NTA\n\nTheir relationship is WEIRD. it\u2019s not appropriate how they SNUGGLE or her SITTING in his LAPS. Don\u2019t get me started on the ppl saying they\u2019re just close. No, it\u2019s gross. My dad and I snuggle in an appropriate way, as in his arm around my shoulder while I have my head on his shoulder. No spooning or sitting in laps. \n\nThey seem to be emotionally incest, maybe they don\u2019t realize it, but they are way too close for comfort. It\u2019s clear this girl gonna come first to anyone he\u2019s ever with so I suggest breaking things off. Don\u2019t listen to anyone saying you\u2019re insecure or jealous because these feelings are valid considering the circumstances. \n\nAgain NTA", "Are you sure nothing is happening between them? She's the perfect person to be taken advantage of & possibly being groomed. Her parents arent really around & he's running to the rescue & then doing everything possible for them to be alone. To the point of telling you that ur just jealous because she's pretty. Like if that was a father daughter type relationship he wouldn't be thinking that at all I suggest u hide some hidden cameras around the apartment & higher a PI because I would bet he's abusing her. How long has he been the one running to her rescue trying to be her savior? I would talk to her parents too & see if they have any of the same concerns.", "Weird", "NTA. You don't really have to reconcile whether this girl genuinely needs him, or if she's taking advantage of him, or if he's overbearing, etc. He's not a good partner. He doesn't intend to change. You deserve better.", "NTA. While it is nice that your bf takes care of his younger cousin who is in difficult circumstances at the moment, I find it creepy that they cuddle on the couch. There's help and then there's inappropriate behaviour. I think that it is inappropriate for M to be sitting on his lap.", "NTA. Oh god, there's so many red flags here. Honestly don't know why she hasn't left him yet.!\n\n>*\"They were cuddling on the couch.\"* ***\" He says that I am jealous because M is a really pretty girl.\"*** *\" If she wants to watch a movie they\u2019ll sit together on the couch, mainly with her in his lap.\"*\n\nHe left you, not only on your birthday but while y'all were in the middle of date watching a movie together to help her with homework.? He seems too overprotective of her, even going so far as suggesting your jealous of the attention he's giving her. That's not appropriate for a 15-year-old girl and any adult, regardless of blood-relativity or not. I can understand if he's trying to be a good role model for his cousin, which is the respectable thing to do. You should be happy to have a man who is that committed to the wellbeing of his family. Family comes first, for him, which is something you're going to have to understand with anyone you date but their relationship does not seem appropriate.\n\nRun. Far away and fast.", "This relationship is weird. I\u2019d be bothered by it. Sitting in his lap and jumping to her every need!  My male cousins use to throw apples at me and trip me up and pull my hair. Never did I have a boyfriend girlfriend relationship with them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve even spoken to them in over 10 years. Start pulling away from your relationship. And start looking for somewhere else to live. He should not of left your birthday or left you at the movies. I wonder if they\u2019re sleeping together. Maybe set up hidden camera\u2019s in your lounge and bedroom.", "NTA- supper creepy she sits in his lap... she's 15 to his 22. Sounds like she may have a crush on him.

We messaged every day, he made career sacrifices for me, dropped anything he was doing if I needed something.  Fast forward a year or two and he confessed he was in love with me and wanted me to run away with him. I\u2019m not drawing any conclusions about this situation, but I\u2019m just leaving this here as something real that happened and I wish someone had protected me. It\u2019s not just inappropriate that they\u2019re cuddling, it sounds like he is taking advantage of and crossing boundaries with his cousin. Calling her \u201cpretty\u201d makes my skin crawl. This can be dismissed as me projecting from my own trauma, but what happened to me was real and I wish I had been protected, so I\u2019m leaving this here hoping that OP and anyone else won\u2019t overlook the signs of something really wrong going on", "Honestly I feel like both of you are partially assholest here. \n\nHe is trying his best to be a good role model for his cousin, which is a respectable thing for him to do.

Wow.\n\nYou should be happy to have a man who is that committed to the wellbeing of his family. He decided to be there where he is needed, not where it is just nice to be.

But comparing his underage cousin to his GIRLFRIEND, and appreciating the cousin\u2019s \u201cprettiness\u201d and valuing her appearance over OP\u2019s, shows an incredibly alarming capacity to perceive his cousin in the same/equal way he does his gf, even if just for the sake of comparison.
