Our husbands are old college friends, and we all have a lot in common (kids the same age, same hobbies, live close). They're a little \"crunchy\" and judgy; for example, when my husband converted to Catholicism before we married they had nasty things to say about it. There's also always been weird rural competition between us, mostly on their side. Whose garden is better, who killed the biggest deer etc. But the real weird spot is money. We clearly make more money than them; J makes a comfortable living (A stays at home) but my husband and I make quite a bit more. You can just sense there's tension when money comes up. \n\nA is really sweet and I enjoy having her as a friend. We workout together while our kids play, we volunteer at the same place, and have many mutual friends. However, she's made some comments in the past and I don't think I realized how much they got under my skin, mostly about me being a working mom (I have a very successful psychiatric practice) and less \"crunchy\" than she is. Little comments about how home schooling means she loves her kids and cares about their future, etc. I don't ever take the bait, I'm usually levelheaded and calm, but maybe resentment was building up? \n\nRecently A joined an MLM, Plexus, which sells \"gut health\" pink drinks. She tried to convince me to recommend it to clients, b/c \"gut health and mental health are connected\" and I firmly but politely said no. I was pretty upset that she'd even suggest it, but was calm. I thought that was the end of it. But recently at a social function she gave me some without my knowledge, then tried to convince me I should sell Plexus. I kept saying no, being polite, and it was becoming more and more embarrassing as some of the other moms there also do MLMs, and she kept saying I could make more money than I make at my practice and \"be a real mom instead of a half-time mom\". I snapped. I saw red. Real mom?\n\nI went off on her about how I make $250k+/year and probably outdid even the top Plexus sellers, which she'll never be as she doesn't have some crazy IG following. I told her MLMs are dumb and predatory, and for moms with superiority complexes about staying home but still want an income - but most likely won't ever get one from MLMs. That she should look up MLM statistics and not live in fantasy land. I was really awful and harsh, and after getting home I felt really bad about what I said and how I said it.\n\nI apologized that night for the mean parts of what I said, but she demanded I walk back what I said about Plexus, and wouldn't apologize back. I don't think I should have to lie to stay friends with her, even though I want to go back to how things were. She's since blown up about me to friends and social media. Our friends are split on who's the AH, but nobody's taking strong sides really. My husband supports me either way, and thinks I was in the right, but I'm really not sure I was. So, AITA?\n\nEdit as suggested from the comments: I am 6 months pregnant, and when she switched my drink I was already on the verge of seeing red because I especially don't want to ingest unregulated drinks while pregnant", "created_utc": 1683682900, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dcs9t/aita_for_bragging_about_how_much_money_i_make_and/", "score": 338, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She isn't a confidante or someone I would hang out with just for the fun of it, but we're at the same stage in our lives, our husbands are very good friends, our kids are very good friends, and we do a lot of the same things. We also live in a small rural community so you run into the same people over and over as your options for social circles are small. I did generally like her, before she spiked my drink and questioned if I'm a \"real mom\" lol", "Not to mention the risks to the baby", "Homeschooling can be beneficial but that doesn't mean your experience is also wrong. My husband was homeschooled so he wouldn't interact with other kids that could influence him away from the religion he was being raised in (they did that on their own), but there are people who are homeschooling in the states simply because of the gun violence in schools. So a blanket statement shouldn't be made entirely. But it has to be done the correct way, anyway.\n\nBut A has no right to criticize people on their parenting especially when she gave a pregnant person an unregulated drink that could contain god knows what", "I agree it seems there's something off with OP's story, especially not seeing sooner that this so-called friend is no friend at all if they do work in psychiatry.\n\nBut, some psychiatrists and others in the mental health/social work umbrella call their patients clients; by using 'client', it emphasizes that their therapeutic relationship is a collaboration, whereas the client has the innate ability to be resilient, and the practitioner is the facilitator or guide in that process. Conversely, 'patient' implies that there is something wrong with the individual, and the relationship is one in which the practitioner is there to fix them. A practitioner might empower individuals as clients versus enabling them as patients. So, it boils down to preference, the comfortability of the one seeking help, and the style of help the practitioner offers. I've been referred to as both and heard both terms used for others, but I understand that might be less common outside Aus or the UK.\n\nAnd psychiatrists who essentially run a private practice, as I think OP is implying she does, call their work psychiatric practice, which is very common here in Aus, so I don't find it odd she's referring to it as such.\u00a0Unless she doesn't have a private practice, again, I agree it's odd, but I've seen a few comments pointing out the client thing and calling it\u00a0psychiatric practice instead of\u00a0psychiatry practice, and as I've had experience with both, I thought it might clear some things up, though again OP isn't in Aus so I don't know how things are where she is.\u00a0", "You should add that to your post", "What ? This is about her neighbor and nobody needs to pay for anything?", "I have an adult child with severe mental illness.  If a Dr were promoting something to help their gut and in turn help their mental illness I might try it.  But if I found out it was a MLM and not backed by professional studies I\u2019d see red.  My thoughts would be that this person is not only unprofessional but also unethical.  It might mean I lose a good professional because of their promoting  a snake oil. The Dr who makes my child sane is one of my greatest allies and are worth every Penny we spend on mental health care. If people were offended maybe they needed to be.", "Personally, it doesn\u2019t matter if she is pregnant or not.

So glad you've found someone that helps your child!!!!!!!!", "yes which makes it worse about dosing", "Thank you.  At one point psych visits, and meds ran us $1500 a month.  If a drink substitute could offset that cost some it would have been tempting.  I heard enough from some MLM sellers on how their product would heal the MI brain, it\u2019s exhausting.  If not for the Rx and competent care we\u2019d have lost our child years ago.

She dosed your drink - which I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t toss at her - and then started up again. And then, to add insult to injury, she called you a half time mum. \n\nWhat?\n\nOf course you went off. I\u2019d have exploded ages ago. You\u2019re not the one \u2018tearing other women down\u2019.

If you were less confident in yourself, that could easily have made you feel horrible about your life and parenting choices. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse, is if you did cave, and become a SAHM, she\u2019d find something wrong with that too. A wants to feel big, and she thinks the best way to do that is by making you small. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a psychiatric term for that, but even if there\u2019s not, it\u2019s not healthy, it\u2019s not kind, and you want nothing to do with it.", "NTA\n\nEeerrrrr drop her like it's hot!

Explain to her husband like this, in most states dosing someone\u2019s drink, whether it be with an illegal substance or not, is a felony.  As you are with child, in most states, this is a double felony.  This is her one and only warning. Should she pull this crap again, cops will be called and charges will be pressed. She has no right to put you or your unborn child in danger. Imagine had you been allergic to one of the ingredients.  This could have caused you and your unborn child sever medical issues. Death by allergic reaction is not off the table, it happens often, even in the US. She owes you an apology. Your husband and hers need to insist she apologize."]}
