Our husbands are old college friends, and we all have a lot in common (kids the same age, same hobbies, live close). They're a little \"crunchy\" and judgy; for example, when my husband converted to Catholicism before we married they had nasty things to say about it. There's also always been weird rural competition between us, mostly on their side. Whose garden is better, who killed the biggest deer etc. But the real weird spot is money. We clearly make more money than them; J makes a comfortable living (A stays at home) but my husband and I make quite a bit more. You can just sense there's tension when money comes up. \n\nA is really sweet and I enjoy having her as a friend. We workout together while our kids play, we volunteer at the same place, and have many mutual friends. However, she's made some comments in the past and I don't think I realized how much they got under my skin, mostly about me being a working mom (I have a very successful psychiatric practice) and less \"crunchy\" than she is. Little comments about how home schooling means she loves her kids and cares about their future, etc. I don't ever take the bait, I'm usually levelheaded and calm, but maybe resentment was building up? \n\nRecently A joined an MLM, Plexus, which sells \"gut health\" pink drinks. She tried to convince me to recommend it to clients, b/c \"gut health and mental health are connected\" and I firmly but politely said no. I was pretty upset that she'd even suggest it, but was calm. I thought that was the end of it. But recently at a social function she gave me some without my knowledge, then tried to convince me I should sell Plexus. I kept saying no, being polite, and it was becoming more and more embarrassing as some of the other moms there also do MLMs, and she kept saying I could make more money than I make at my practice and \"be a real mom instead of a half-time mom\". I snapped. I saw red. Real mom?\n\nI went off on her about how I make $250k+/year and probably outdid even the top Plexus sellers, which she'll never be as she doesn't have some crazy IG following. I told her MLMs are dumb and predatory, and for moms with superiority complexes about staying home but still want an income - but most likely won't ever get one from MLMs. That she should look up MLM statistics and not live in fantasy land. I was really awful and harsh, and after getting home I felt really bad about what I said and how I said it.\n\nI apologized that night for the mean parts of what I said, but she demanded I walk back what I said about Plexus, and wouldn't apologize back. I don't think I should have to lie to stay friends with her, even though I want to go back to how things were. She's since blown up about me to friends and social media. Our friends are split on who's the AH, but nobody's taking strong sides really. My husband supports me either way, and thinks I was in the right, but I'm really not sure I was.

This was after you had already said no to her more than once.\n\nFriendly competitions over the best garden are one thing, but refusing to respect your boundaries? Implying that you're not a real mom because you also work? Feeding you something without your knowledge? That's not a friend. That's an AH predator - run.", "NTA- and that isn\u2019t a friend at all. How dare she, what century is this?", "NTA- If she'd accepted your lack of interest in shilling her overpriced caffeinated fiber supplement , none of this would have happened. \n\n>But recently at a social function she gave me some without my knowledge, then tried to convince me I should sell Plexus.\n\nShe dosed you! This person isn't a friend  at all.\n\nObviously,  your outburst was not ideal but, after everything that preceded it, between getting dosed with a product you didn't agree to sample, getting pressed *at a social function* to push this snake oil in your professional practice and getting accused of being a bad parent , I can't say I blame you for losing your cool.\n\n\n(Would it even be ethical to promote a product like this to people who are already not in a great place when you are in such a position of trust?

Did I jut read in a comment that she drugged you while you were 6 months pregnant???? Altering somebody's drink is completely unhinged especially since you were pregnant! That's insane! How did she KNOW without a doubt that you were not allergic to the ingredients? Yes MLMs are scams and she obviously has some sort of thing where she puts you down to stroke her own ego (so not a real friend!) but that crosses the line! NTA and you need to stay away from this psycho!", "NTA. She personally attacked you and your parenting in public.  She provoked the fight. You're not an AH for defending yourself though there was no need to mention how much you make as it is irrelevant.  The fact that you work outside the home does not make you less of a parent. You apologized for your harsh words.  She had no right to say that you are not a real mom. She owes you an apology. Hopefully with time, she can gain some perspective about how awful she treated you. Otherwise, I'd let the friendship cool.", "NTA - Your \"hon\" friend needs a slap of reality to the face. Nothing you said was inaccurate. MLMs to specifically target SAHMs who unfortunately don't know any better.", "NTA.\n1. She wasn't accepting \"no\" as an answer - a classic sign of asshole behavior.\n2. She tried to manipulate you by judging you as a mother, which is a sensitive topic.\n\nYou said what you said because you were pushed to your breaking point. Before that, you were civil.", "NTA.  If you are a psychiatrist - that means you have a medical degree right?  You are also a doctor?  So that means you can't sell or promote something that has no scientific basis, as you saying it gives it legitimacy and would be possibly be unethical.\n\nOf course these drinks are not scientifically proven - if they were, they would be sold in pharmacies, not at parties or on IG......sounds like a pyramid scheme to me.\n\nedit - typo", "NTA I\u2019m mostly with u after u said she slipped u the drink without ur knowledge", "NTA.

She would not take no for an answer and began insulting you and your parenting, in public. \n\nI would have gone off on her too. The money comment was relevant. I probably would not have apologized to her until she apologized for all of her above mentioned actions first. \n\nAs it stands, she would no longer be my friend/friendly acquaintance and ANYONE who give me grief over this is told about 1+2 and if they still give me grief, they too are no longer my friends. \n\nNTA", "NTA simply based on rejecting the MLM scam immediately.", "NTA. This woman is a mess.", "At that point, she had dosed you against your will and was still pushing her crap on you. You said no multiple times. Kindly and politely. \n\nThinking you would want to give up a successful practice for MLM seems like a wild idea, But MLM schemes tell you to look for people you want to work with. If she brought you in, she would be your \"up line\" or whatever kitschy term they use. Basically, over you. So that might help you understand why the idea appeals to her. \n\nEven so, she was beyond predatory to you. Violated your consent by causing you to ingest something you had already declined. Did you owe her a reason for your no? Of course not, she all but demanded it by her behavior. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe kept pushing and pushing. She just did not get the response she wanted.", "NTA.\n\nMLMs are annoying and preys on the vulnerable.\n\nThat said, you should have a prepared spiel when people try to rope you in.

Something along the lines of being a good role model to your kids when you tell them that they can be anything they want to be.", "NTA. I was leaning toward ESH, because even though she is very irritating, maybe you should have been more diplomatic.

Also her constant little jabs at you are way out of line.", "NTA\n\nAll things considered she doesn't seem like a friend worth having. The constant conpetition, the little jabs, this mother superiority, the crossing of your boundaries - she inflates herself to look bigger than you and you've been level headed and gracious enough to be the bigger person about it, but that is really exhausting. I understand you snapped.\n\nHowever, you seem to also know a lot about MLMs, so I invite you to consider that your friend is a victim, and that there is something seriously lacking in her life. There might be some subtle form of financial abuse too, if she's so desperate to make money (statistically probable, but I don't know them). Could be worth having a serious conversation about it. Or cut your losses. You could do that too.", "INFO You are a psychiatrist and you are asking some randoms for advice regarding rather mundane human behavior?", "Wow. Hell would be being friends with all of you.\n\nYou are all AHs. \n\nESH.", "eeeehhh.. ESH. sorry to say it. she had no right coming at you like that.. but you also didn't need to come at her like that. she's probably insecure that you and you alone could support your family while she's the one that stays at home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
