My parents have been doing this for 25 years and are very responsible and trustworthy people. We always encourage potential clients to check out their local shelters before buying from us because we care about animals and primarily cater to people with allergies (we have hypoallergenic breeds). We make sure to thoroughly look through applicants to make sure these puppies go to great homes and that they will be taken care of. \n\nDecember 2022 we announced that we would have a litter ready for adoption in January 2023. My mom has a coworker who has been talking about adopting a puppy with us for some years. She recently retired from her job and decided it was finally the right time. Like all responsible breeders, we make sure they are fully tested before pickup. We also include a full timeline of vet care.\n\nSome of the clients that come in prefer to pay for their dogs over time instead of all at once. We take a deposit and put them on monthly payments for however long the bill is for. It's a great way for families to not have to worry about that big cost upfront. So this is what the coworker decided to do. The morning of the pickup I gave her all the documents she needed about the puppy and what to do and not to do over the next couple of months. One of them I told her to not let the puppy in grass or come into contact with foreign dogs until they have had all their shots. This is to prevent diseases like parvo. She was on board with everything and we said goodbye to our little one.\n\n2 weeks ago my mom tells me that her coworker called her crying because she said her puppy got ill and the vets couldn't save her. This was a complete shock because the puppy had a clean bill of health before she left. My mom comforting her asked her does she know how the puppy got sick and she replied that she doesn't know. I was puzzled. I decided to call her up myself to try to get more information. She tells me that she hadn't had the chance to take the puppy to get all her shots but that she took the puppy anyway to a dog park and allowed her to sniff and walk around in the grass because she looked sad being indoors. I was livid but I expressed my condolences and asked if there was anything she needed from us. She asked if she would still have the monthly payments since the dog was no longer alive. I told her yes ma'am even though the dog isn't with you anymore, your balance is still outstanding so it would auto-draft. She got very upset and started yelling at me that I was heartless and that now she has to be reminded about her dog every month. I told her that I was sorry and offered another puppy that would be coming soon. She scoffed and said no I just don't want to pay for a dog I don't have. And then she hung up.\n\nI told my mom the story and she said she would talk with her. \n\nAITA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1678983863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11syrll/aita_for_telling_a_customer_she_still_has_to_pay/", "score": 330, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s contractually obliged to do so. As a general practice going forward, I\u2019d advise that final instalments should be paid quickly after the \u201cgoods\u201d have left the seller i.e. on completion of the transaction so as to avoid complications like this. \n\nYou would be very much the AH if you do allow her to buy another puppy knowing that her wilful irresponsibility cost a puppy their life!

I can almost guarantee you, if she\u2019s on some sort of direct withdrawal plan with her bank or credit card, she\u2019s going to cancel it and refuse to pay, in which case, Small Claims Court will be your only recourse of getting the money she owes.", "NTA - She literally failed at dog ownership at the very first hurdle!

Her negligence caused the puppy to be killed because she exposed it to a dog park without having it fully vaccinated, even though you explicitly told her to avoid such places until the puppy was fully vaccinated. She still owes the purchase price.\n\nLegally, this is no different than if she had purchased a car and decided to race down an icy road, causing her to wreck and total the car. Her negligence would have caused the wreck. Her bill is still outstanding.\n\nBUT it may be a good idea to put something into your contracts so that it is very clearly spelled out that they are responsible for the full puppy price if they are making payments and the dog dies due to their negligence. You obviously had the paperwork showing you delivered a healthy puppy to her.", "Why the fuck would you offer her another puppy?! she's clearly too irresponsible to own an animal.

You already know she was ultimately responsible for the death of the first puppy. And you go and offer to sell her another? Do you honestly care, at all, for the puppies?

Make sure you inform other breeders about her.", "Esh\n\nNot only did she not do the basic care you told her, she actively ignored it and endangered the dog to the point where they passed.\n\nYou are an ah because knowing all that, you still offered her another dog, making it seem like you don't care about the dogs, its just business.", "ESH. Clearly the customer is for being unable to follow simple instructions that may have cost the pup it's life, and probably for delaying vet care until it was too late. You are for letting your curiosity get the best of you. The customer had already been in contact with your mother, so there was no need for you to jump in right away and question the customer over what happened. You should have discussed next steps with your mother first, because now you may have created an issue for her at work.", "YTA I'm sorry but you do NOT sound like a reputable breeder. You might not be a puppy mill but you're a backyard breeder I'd say. So...yeah YTA.

Couldn\u2019t she easily get the card cut off (unless y\u2019all go by checking account) even then she can have that account closed. If they can\u2019t afford the dog in cash they should just put it on a credit card. That\u2019s what I did when I got my pup. I don\u2019t understand how a dog can die so easily, it\u2019s not that hard to keep a dog alive. I\u2019ve heard of owners who never take their dog to the vet and give them their shots themselves. Seems like a freak accident or an unfortunate accident with the dog.", "NAH - It was insensitive but she could have paid off the whole dog at once so she wouldn\u2019t have to be reminded each month.\n\nHer recklessness got the poor puppy killed so I probably wouldn\u2019t have offered to let her get another.

These are the most common signs of what is called a reputable or an ethical breeder:\n\n\\- Titles their dogs, such as IGP for working breeds, hunt tests for sporting, agility, herding competitions, etc. This means they're proven in the jobs they were bred for.\n\n\\- Health/temperament tests and reports the health scores to OFA, which is the national database for the scores of health/genetic tests. Means the breeders only breed animals without genetic markers for common health problems for the breed. The breeder will also display the OFA results on their dogs' individual pages on their website, and a potential buyer is able to look up the scores themselves on the OFA website. Also doesn't breed any dog with unfavorable or unpredicted temperament - i.e. a lab with any kind of aggression. \n\n\\- Buy-back clause. This is a big one. Means that if for any reason, a buyer can no longer keep or care for the dog, the breeder will take the dog back. Keeps their dogs out of shelters and homes not prepared to care for them.\n\n\\- Doesn't breed excessively during the year / doesn't have females always pregnant.\n\n\\- Doesn't breed for \"fad\" colors, i.e. merle French bulldogs or silver labs.\n\n\\- Thoroughly vets their buyers. If they don't feel you're a good fit, they won't sell to you.\n\n\\- Breeds to standard (I'll argue with the exception of American and English labs; they may as well be their own separate breeds at this point), and doesn't cross unless it's with purpose - an example of a purpose-bred mix would be a lurcher or a bull-herder. \n\n\\- Doesn't breed for profit. Breeding is expensive, with all the titling, testing, and vet care for numerous puppies.\n\nDoodle breeders don't do any of this. Every dog in a litter is a crap-shoot; all different coat types, temperaments, etc. They bank on creating the hot new designer breed to make money rather than breeding to create a standard.
