My parents have been doing this for 25 years and are very responsible and trustworthy people. We always encourage potential clients to check out their local shelters before buying from us because we care about animals and primarily cater to people with allergies (we have hypoallergenic breeds). We make sure to thoroughly look through applicants to make sure these puppies go to great homes and that they will be taken care of. \n\nDecember 2022 we announced that we would have a litter ready for adoption in January 2023. My mom has a coworker who has been talking about adopting a puppy with us for some years. She recently retired from her job and decided it was finally the right time. Like all responsible breeders, we make sure they are fully tested before pickup. We also include a full timeline of vet care.\n\nSome of the clients that come in prefer to pay for their dogs over time instead of all at once. We take a deposit and put them on monthly payments for however long the bill is for. It's a great way for families to not have to worry about that big cost upfront. So this is what the coworker decided to do. The morning of the pickup I gave her all the documents she needed about the puppy and what to do and not to do over the next couple of months. One of them I told her to not let the puppy in grass or come into contact with foreign dogs until they have had all their shots. This is to prevent diseases like parvo. She was on board with everything and we said goodbye to our little one.\n\n2 weeks ago my mom tells me that her coworker called her crying because she said her puppy got ill and the vets couldn't save her. This was a complete shock because the puppy had a clean bill of health before she left. My mom comforting her asked her does she know how the puppy got sick and she replied that she doesn't know. I was puzzled. I decided to call her up myself to try to get more information. She tells me that she hadn't had the chance to take the puppy to get all her shots but that she took the puppy anyway to a dog park and allowed her to sniff and walk around in the grass because she looked sad being indoors. I was livid but I expressed my condolences and asked if there was anything she needed from us. She asked if she would still have the monthly payments since the dog was no longer alive. I told her yes ma'am even though the dog isn't with you anymore, your balance is still outstanding so it would auto-draft. She got very upset and started yelling at me that I was heartless and that now she has to be reminded about her dog every month. I told her that I was sorry and offered another puppy that would be coming soon. She scoffed and said no I just don't want to pay for a dog I don't have. And then she hung up.\n\nI told my mom the story and she said she would talk with her. \n\nAITA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1678983863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11syrll/aita_for_telling_a_customer_she_still_has_to_pay/", "score": 208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s contractually obliged to do so. As a general practice going forward, I\u2019d advise that final instalments should be paid quickly after the \u201cgoods\u201d have left the seller i.e. on completion of the transaction so as to avoid complications like this. \n\nYou would be very much the AH if you do allow her to buy another puppy knowing that her wilful irresponsibility cost a puppy their life!

I can almost guarantee you, if she\u2019s on some sort of direct withdrawal plan with her bank or credit card, she\u2019s going to cancel it and refuse to pay, in which case, Small Claims Court will be your only recourse of getting the money she owes.", "NTA - She literally failed at dog ownership at the very first hurdle!

Her negligence caused the puppy to be killed because she exposed it to a dog park without having it fully vaccinated, even though you explicitly told her to avoid such places until the puppy was fully vaccinated. She still owes the purchase price.\n\nLegally, this is no different than if she had purchased a car and decided to race down an icy road, causing her to wreck and total the car. Her negligence would have caused the wreck. Her bill is still outstanding.\n\nBUT it may be a good idea to put something into your contracts so that it is very clearly spelled out that they are responsible for the full puppy price if they are making payments and the dog dies due to their negligence. You obviously had the paperwork showing you delivered a healthy puppy to her.", "Why the fuck would you offer her another puppy?! she's clearly too irresponsible to own an animal.

You already know she was ultimately responsible for the death of the first puppy. And you go and offer to sell her another? Do you honestly care, at all, for the puppies?

Make sure you inform other breeders about her.", "Esh\n\nNot only did she not do the basic care you told her, she actively ignored it and endangered the dog to the point where they passed.\n\nYou are an ah because knowing all that, you still offered her another dog, making it seem like you don't care about the dogs, its just business.", "ESH. Clearly the customer is for being unable to follow simple instructions that may have cost the pup it's life, and probably for delaying vet care until it was too late. You are for letting your curiosity get the best of you. The customer had already been in contact with your mother, so there was no need for you to jump in right away and question the customer over what happened. You should have discussed next steps with your mother first, because now you may have created an issue for her at work.", "YTA I'm sorry but you do NOT sound like a reputable breeder. You might not be a puppy mill but you're a backyard breeder I'd say. So...yeah YTA.

Couldn\u2019t she easily get the card cut off (unless y\u2019all go by checking account) even then she can have that account closed. If they can\u2019t afford the dog in cash they should just put it on a credit card. That\u2019s what I did when I got my pup. I don\u2019t understand how a dog can die so easily, it\u2019s not that hard to keep a dog alive. I\u2019ve heard of owners who never take their dog to the vet and give them their shots themselves. Seems like a freak accident or an unfortunate accident with the dog.", "NAH - It was insensitive but she could have paid off the whole dog at once so she wouldn\u2019t have to be reminded each month.\n\nHer recklessness got the poor puppy killed so I probably wouldn\u2019t have offered to let her get another.

Also doing this as a business rather than the love of preserving a breed.", "NTA.\n\nNot every underlying genetic or heritable condition can be tested for but that sounds standard.", "What tests?", "Also, the fact that they make enough to support 3 people says that they produce a lot of litters.", "There are actually many dogs that fit into the category, for instance, Maltese, poodle, schnauzer.", "Agreed. Which is why this won't happen again.", "My issue with that comment is that you're implying that this is common in which it is not. This was the first case of its kind in 20 years and I made a mistake with a family friend. I have never done anything outside of the book until this lady.", "We only sell Maltese", "That was the red flag for me.  There's no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog.  There are dog breeds that are less likely to shed allergens, but anyone claiming \"hypoallergenic\" is falsely advertising.", "\"Doodles\" probably.", "We do not advertise \"Hypoallergenic\". We are very aware of the danger of that term but I used it in this example because people would understand. We sell Maltese puppies. We don't do \"doodles\" like people suspect. We tell all clients that our dogs do not shed unless combed and that they are great options for people who do not want the cleanup or have family members who are allergic to dog hair.", "Yes it does. Our badges and clientele would disagree with you.", "That too. I\u2019m pretty sure that reputable breeders limit their dogs to 1-2 litters a year.\n\nETA: And like, sorry, but if you\u2019re breeding responsibly you are not making enough to support three people. Not with all the titling, health and temperament tests, vet fees, etc.", "The mother seems to have another job with the person who killed their puppy. So it doesn't sound like breeding alone is supporting three people to be fair.", "This is not our only income. And we do not produce a lot of litters. We have two females who will have babies around each other and that's it until the end of the year. My mom is a nurse, my dad is a contractor and I am a graphic designer who works from home.", "It\u2019s more the plural that got my eyebrows up than the claim of hypoallergenic, although that doesn\u2019t very much help either because it\u2019s a hot button phrase of Doodle breeders.\n\nBut reputable breeders rarely, if ever, commit to more than one breed.", "Might be cultural but idk anyone who breeds any of these breeds seriously and use \"hypoallergenic\" as a selling point. And I grew up with a poodle and am currently looking for another poodle.", "You have said multiple times \"breeds.\"", "That is my suspicion, but even doodle clubs have breeder code of ethics with stipulations against falsely advertising them as hypoallergenic.", "We sell Maltese not doodles", "I'm glad to hear you don't advertise it, but I'm sure you understand my and other redditors' confusion since you use that word repeatedly and comment with anecdotes about how 'hypoallergenic' they are.\n\nAlso, you'd probably get a more positive response if you explained what exactly you do that makes you a responsible breeder, rather than just stating it repeatedly.  \n\nI'm not saying these things to be a troll or asshole, just trying to help you see how things look from the outside.", "Badges? How about OFAs? What are your dogs' scores?", "I once had someone say, \"Well how would a breeder make money with all those tests and vet visits?\"\n\nThat's exactly the point. They don't do it for money.", "Came here to say this. Irks me that OP said \"breeding\" and \"buisness\" in the same sentence.  \n\nI don't know any legit dog breeder who makes more than *maybe* a few hundred bucks in profit off a litter, and those few hundred bucks is reinvested into their dogs to keep them titled, healthy etc. No one is living off it unless they run basically a doodle puppy-mill.\n\nAlso - no contact with grass??? Wth??? My late dog was playing in grass with her siblings the day we picked her up.", "We only sell Maltese but I guess I didn't know how to say \"breed\" in the sentence without it sounding grammatically incorrect. I apologize for the confusion.", "What was the correct word I was supposed to use?", "Once again, your wording makes one pause.", "Places where other dogs that may not have their shots is a fantastic way to give your puppy parvo, because parvo sticks around for weeks even with rain. No puppy without at least the first two rounds of shots should ever be put down in public places like parks, pet stores, and places dogs are allowed to frequent (lowes, home depot etc.) Because that contamination can either kill your pup or end you with a very serious vet bill because they have to be isolated and put on ivs to prevent death.", "I don't know what you want me to call it? At the end of the day our operation is considered a business. And yes you're right. Its extremely expensive which is why we decided to introduce payment plans for families. Many times its not because they cant afford it, it's just a preference thing. Also I could not say a lot in the 3000 limit like I wanted to. I went into great detail about outside public areas like a dog park where the grass could have contaminated feces etc. Not that the dog couldn't play in their backyard.", "Once again with the sell. \n\n>My side of the family have cat and dog allergies but they have never broken out with our breed and own one to this day with no reaction.  \n>  \n>(we have a hypoallergenic breed)\n\nI literally took out one letter to make it singular, and added one letter in the second sentence.", "Well you seem to be saying you breed one breed, so why would you use the plural?", "Fair! I just reacted to the blanket statement of \"no grass\" lol. I interpert things very literally often", "I mean even if you sell on payments, how do you make enough to support three adults?", "Because this isn't our main source of income. My parents have jobs and so do I. I live with them so I contribute my share with the care. You couldn't live off of just this. You would need a crazy amount of dogs and we don't think that's responsible to do that.", "Understandable! The way it was worded in OP kinda made it sound like this is your only source of income"]}
