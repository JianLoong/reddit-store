My parents have been doing this for 25 years and are very responsible and trustworthy people. We always encourage potential clients to check out their local shelters before buying from us because we care about animals and primarily cater to people with allergies (we have hypoallergenic breeds). We make sure to thoroughly look through applicants to make sure these puppies go to great homes and that they will be taken care of. \n\nDecember 2022 we announced that we would have a litter ready for adoption in January 2023. My mom has a coworker who has been talking about adopting a puppy with us for some years. She recently retired from her job and decided it was finally the right time. Like all responsible breeders, we make sure they are fully tested before pickup. We also include a full timeline of vet care.\n\nSome of the clients that come in prefer to pay for their dogs over time instead of all at once. We take a deposit and put them on monthly payments for however long the bill is for. It's a great way for families to not have to worry about that big cost upfront. So this is what the coworker decided to do. The morning of the pickup I gave her all the documents she needed about the puppy and what to do and not to do over the next couple of months. One of them I told her to not let the puppy in grass or come into contact with foreign dogs until they have had all their shots. This is to prevent diseases like parvo. She was on board with everything and we said goodbye to our little one.\n\n2 weeks ago my mom tells me that her coworker called her crying because she said her puppy got ill and the vets couldn't save her. This was a complete shock because the puppy had a clean bill of health before she left. My mom comforting her asked her does she know how the puppy got sick and she replied that she doesn't know. I was puzzled. I decided to call her up myself to try to get more information. She tells me that she hadn't had the chance to take the puppy to get all her shots but that she took the puppy anyway to a dog park and allowed her to sniff and walk around in the grass because she looked sad being indoors. I was livid but I expressed my condolences and asked if there was anything she needed from us. She asked if she would still have the monthly payments since the dog was no longer alive. I told her yes ma'am even though the dog isn't with you anymore, your balance is still outstanding so it would auto-draft. She got very upset and started yelling at me that I was heartless and that now she has to be reminded about her dog every month. I told her that I was sorry and offered another puppy that would be coming soon. She scoffed and said no I just don't want to pay for a dog I don't have. And then she hung up.\n\nI told my mom the story and she said she would talk with her. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: She will not be getting anymore animals from us. It was a lapse in judgement due to being frazzled by her yelling on the phone. \nWe have done everything by the book to ensure the safety of all our animals. She had no history of neglect and had a great home so we didn\u2019t believe anything would go wrong.

It's sad, and I feel horrible for the dog, but it is 100% on her (and was 100% preventable).\n\nPLEASE do not let that person purchase another puppy from you.", "NTA for making her pay for the dog. She\u2019s contractually obliged to do so. As a general practice going forward, I\u2019d advise that final instalments should be paid quickly after the \u201cgoods\u201d have left the seller i.e. on completion of the transaction so as to avoid complications like this. \n\nYou would be very much the AH if you do allow her to buy another puppy knowing that her wilful irresponsibility cost a puppy their life!

I can almost guarantee you, if she\u2019s on some sort of direct withdrawal plan with her bank or credit card, she\u2019s going to cancel it and refuse to pay, in which case, Small Claims Court will be your only recourse of getting the money she owes.", "NTA - She literally failed at dog ownership at the very first hurdle!

It's not your fault that the dog did not live long. If this were any other purchase, she would of course be on the hook for it regardless of whether she cares for the item well or for how long she uses it.

It sounds like you are a junior in the family business with mom or dad being the boss of the family business.\n\nWhich makes me wonder why mom didn't inquire, console and deal with the woman with the dead puppy herself, since she's been doing this for 25 years.", "NTA.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, this is pretty simple: she financed a purchase, agreeing to make payments. Her negligence caused the puppy to be killed because she exposed it to a dog park without having it fully vaccinated, even though you explicitly told her to avoid such places until the puppy was fully vaccinated. She still owes the purchase price.\n\nLegally, this is no different than if she had purchased a car and decided to race down an icy road, causing her to wreck and total the car. Her negligence would have caused the wreck. Her bill is still outstanding.\n\nBUT it may be a good idea to put something into your contracts so that it is very clearly spelled out that they are responsible for the full puppy price if they are making payments and the dog dies due to their negligence. You obviously had the paperwork showing you delivered a healthy puppy to her.", "Why the fuck would you offer her another puppy?! she's clearly too irresponsible to own an animal.

You already know she was ultimately responsible for the death of the first puppy. And you go and offer to sell her another? Do you honestly care, at all, for the puppies? Or are they just a pay check for you? Your negligence here is disgusting. \n\nGet the money you are owed, and then blacklist her. Make sure you inform other breeders about her.", "Esh\n\nNot only did she not do the basic care you told her, she actively ignored it and endangered the dog to the point where they passed.\n\nYou are an ah because knowing all that, you still offered her another dog, making it seem like you don't care about the dogs, its just business.", "ESH. Clearly the customer is for being unable to follow simple instructions that may have cost the pup it's life, and probably for delaying vet care until it was too late. You are for letting your curiosity get the best of you. The customer had already been in contact with your mother, so there was no need for you to jump in right away and question the customer over what happened. You should have discussed next steps with your mother first, because now you may have created an issue for her at work.", "YTA I'm sorry but you do NOT sound like a reputable breeder. You might not be a puppy mill but you're a backyard breeder I'd say. So...yeah YTA. This is what happens when you don't know how to properly sell dogs.", "Hmmm, never heard of a breeder taking payment plans. A deposit yes but a whole payment plan? Couldn\u2019t she easily get the card cut off (unless y\u2019all go by checking account) even then she can have that account closed. If they can\u2019t afford the dog in cash they should just put it on a credit card. That\u2019s what I did when I got my pup. I don\u2019t understand how a dog can die so easily, it\u2019s not that hard to keep a dog alive. I\u2019ve heard of owners who never take their dog to the vet and give them their shots themselves. Seems like a freak accident or an unfortunate accident with the dog.", "NAH - It was insensitive but she could have paid off the whole dog at once so she wouldn\u2019t have to be reminded each month.\n\nHer recklessness got the poor puppy killed so I probably wouldn\u2019t have offered to let her get another.

Means the breeders only breed animals without genetic markers for common health problems for the breed. The breeder will also display the OFA results on their dogs' individual pages on their website, and a potential buyer is able to look up the scores themselves on the OFA website. Also doesn't breed any dog with unfavorable or unpredicted temperament - i.e. a lab with any kind of aggression. \n\n\\- Buy-back clause. This is a big one. Means that if for any reason, a buyer can no longer keep or care for the dog, the breeder will take the dog back. Keeps their dogs out of shelters and homes not prepared to care for them.\n\n\\- Doesn't breed excessively during the year / doesn't have females always pregnant.\n\n\\- Doesn't breed for \"fad\" colors, i.e. merle French bulldogs or silver labs.\n\n\\- Thoroughly vets their buyers. If they don't feel you're a good fit, they won't sell to you.\n\n\\- Breeds to standard (I'll argue with the exception of American and English labs; they may as well be their own separate breeds at this point), and doesn't cross unless it's with purpose - an example of a purpose-bred mix would be a lurcher or a bull-herder. \n\n\\- Doesn't breed for profit. Breeding is expensive, with all the titling, testing, and vet care for numerous puppies.\n\nDoodle breeders don't do any of this.

Also those added weeks give the pups a chance to pick up much needed social skills from their mother and liter mates leading to a better more balanced dog.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally Puppy Protection Laws ensure that within the first year (typically) if a dog gets sick or dies the client is entitled to a refund or a replacement. Another reason why reputable breeders do not release their dogs without protecting them first with at least 2 rounds of shots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs irresponsible as the buyer here was the onus is on Op as the buisness owner to insure that the product, the puppies, are healthy and have enough of their shots to not be open to easily avoidable sickness like parvo.", "Given that we don\u2019t know what state OP is in & that\u2019s not the law in every state, you clearly don\u2019t know that\u2019s the case.

She still owes the balance.", "I work with a foster for Pomeranians and our worst case of puppy mills was a large Amish breeder out of Indiana. Horrible conditions, living for years in their own filth in a small cage, dead dogs in their cages, the most disgusting thing I\u2019ve ever seen. Amish do not see their animals as anything but a commodity. Do not EVER buy from them", "The Amish are notorious for their puppy mills.

Did you even read her replies?", "8 weeks is the bare minimum by law. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReputable breeders do not separate the pups from the mother until the 2nd round of shots as it is safer, 12 weeks typically especially for smaller breeds. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts also seen as unethical to separate them early from the mother and can lead to behavioral problems later on. Those added weeks allow the pups to pick up beneficial social skills from both mom and litter mates. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are being negligent by releasing defenseless animals without that second round of vaccinations and knowingly opening them up to sickness and death. Its actually shocking that this hasn't occurred more frequently. You have lucked out so far. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTW research the Puppy Protection Laws in your area. The client is absolutely within her rights to demand a refund or replacement by law within a certain time frame if the puppy gets sick and/or dies.

While the average heat cycle occurs twice a year, it can be more or less. The safest and most responsible way to breed a dog is to not skip a heat cycle. So if a dog doesn't get pregnant in a heat cycle, they should be retired. This often does come out to 1-2 litters per year, but it's not about a set number. It's about how often the dame goes into heat.", "Honestly 2 is pushing it imo, mom basically spends all year pregnant/nursing etc", "Why do you need to know so much?

It's a huge thing in the US to advertise puppies as hypoallergenic even if it isn't technically true. My seriously allergic friend and her husband bought a golden doodle.

That's a good start, but could still be considered a backyard breeder to a lot of people. \n\nFor example, did I read somewhere that you send the puppies home at 8 weeks? Because the maltese club of america breeder code of ethics requires not sending puppies home until 12 weeks. \n\nDo you compete in conformation shows, obedience trials, or any other type of competition? Because the best way to establish that your breeding stock is more worthy of passing on it's genes than any other dog is to have them evaluated by third parties and communities of your peers. \n\nIt also raises some red flags to me that you offer payment plans, because the initial purchase may be one of the cheapest parts of dog ownership. I personally would be concerned that anyone in need of a payment plan for the initial purchase does not have the financial resources to provide adequate veterinary care in an emergency. \n\nI understand that you weren't expecting to be held trial for these things when you first wrote your post, but all of these practices are related to what led to this puppy's death, so it is all relevant to our judgement. Also, obviously, people who love dogs really care about the pet overpopulation crisis, and hold breeders to very high standards because of this.", "Because OP has very much been avoiding the question about what they have done to ensure their dogs are healthy and fit for being parents, and are relying on \"clientele\" to say they're good breeders, all signs of backyard breeding.", "She actually didn't answer. These are normal things that happen at vet visits for any dog. When breeding a dog, more tests are needed for ensure the parents aren't passing on bad genes.

We have done nothing but make sure we are responsible and have fought to make sure we are not these horrible back yard breeders.

We do not put them into shows but they have been evaluated by third parties.\n\nI don\u2019t know why people are so up in arms about the payment plan. Out of 100 clients, maybe 2 will go on the payment plan. It just breaks the bill into a few months. We are not releasing our puppies to people who cannot afford them. Some people space out the payments for several different reasons. They have to pay a deposit to even get on the waiting list and then put down a 50% deposit.

Could be 10 days to 2 months... again potentially falls into timeline here.
