My parents have been doing this for 25 years and are very responsible and trustworthy people. We always encourage potential clients to check out their local shelters before buying from us because we care about animals and primarily cater to people with allergies (we have hypoallergenic breeds). We make sure to thoroughly look through applicants to make sure these puppies go to great homes and that they will be taken care of. \n\nDecember 2022 we announced that we would have a litter ready for adoption in January 2023. My mom has a coworker who has been talking about adopting a puppy with us for some years. She recently retired from her job and decided it was finally the right time. Like all responsible breeders, we make sure they are fully tested before pickup. We also include a full timeline of vet care.\n\nSome of the clients that come in prefer to pay for their dogs over time instead of all at once. We take a deposit and put them on monthly payments for however long the bill is for. It's a great way for families to not have to worry about that big cost upfront. So this is what the coworker decided to do. The morning of the pickup I gave her all the documents she needed about the puppy and what to do and not to do over the next couple of months. One of them I told her to not let the puppy in grass or come into contact with foreign dogs until they have had all their shots. This is to prevent diseases like parvo. She was on board with everything and we said goodbye to our little one.\n\n2 weeks ago my mom tells me that her coworker called her crying because she said her puppy got ill and the vets couldn't save her. This was a complete shock because the puppy had a clean bill of health before she left. My mom comforting her asked her does she know how the puppy got sick and she replied that she doesn't know. I was puzzled. I decided to call her up myself to try to get more information. She tells me that she hadn't had the chance to take the puppy to get all her shots but that she took the puppy anyway to a dog park and allowed her to sniff and walk around in the grass because she looked sad being indoors. I was livid but I expressed my condolences and asked if there was anything she needed from us. She asked if she would still have the monthly payments since the dog was no longer alive. I told her yes ma'am even though the dog isn't with you anymore, your balance is still outstanding so it would auto-draft. She got very upset and started yelling at me that I was heartless and that now she has to be reminded about her dog every month. I told her that I was sorry and offered another puppy that would be coming soon. She scoffed and said no I just don't want to pay for a dog I don't have. And then she hung up.\n\nI told my mom the story and she said she would talk with her. \n\nAITA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1678983863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11syrll/aita_for_telling_a_customer_she_still_has_to_pay/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you crash and total a car, you're still on the hook for paying it off; if a house burns down, you pay the bank, minus any insurance you might have, of course.\n\nThis is the same.\n\nYou told her not to let her dog around other animals and she did. It's sad, and I feel horrible for the dog, but it is 100% on her (and was 100% preventable).\n\nPLEASE do not let that person purchase another puppy from you.", "NTA for making her pay for the dog. She\u2019s contractually obliged to do so. As a general practice going forward, I\u2019d advise that final instalments should be paid quickly after the \u201cgoods\u201d have left the seller i.e. on completion of the transaction so as to avoid complications like this. \n\nYou would be very much the AH if you do allow her to buy another puppy knowing that her wilful irresponsibility cost a puppy their life! Why would you offer that?", "NTA, it's a contract with a payment plan. this is a horrible question, but does the contract include ongoing financial responsibility if something like this happens before all payments have been made? \n\nshe is so irresponsible, please don't give her another puppy.", "NTA.\nAnd please DONT let her have another dog. She killed her dog through willful negligence.\n\nThe next time it will be through something else she decides isn\u2019t actually important but turns out it was (ex: trash eating, sock stealing, medicine safety. Ect.)", "NTA. Do you have clients sign a contract when doing payment plans? If so, maybe this is something that should be added in.", "NTA. Let\u2019s put it this way; if a person buys a brand new car on a monthly payment plan and then wrecks it 2 months later (or does this with a smartphone, a laptop, or anything else that you pay off in monthly installments) is the company they bought it from just going to write it off because the customer doesn\u2019t have it anymore? No.\n\nShe was given very clear instructions; don\u2019t let the pup near other dogs until fully vaccinated. She chose to ignore this, and her monthly payments are the consequences of her bad decision.\n\nDon\u2019t offer her another puppy, don\u2019t offer to stop the payments. Don\u2019t allow this adult-child to continue under the delusion that there are no consequences for ignoring instructions and thinking they know better.\n\nEdit: This has no weight on my judgement but is some needed information on how to proceed from here: did you make her sign a contract specifying she should not let the pup come into contact with other dogs, and do you have some sort of email exchange where she stated that she did just that? I can almost guarantee you, if she\u2019s on some sort of direct withdrawal plan with her bank or credit card, she\u2019s going to cancel it and refuse to pay, in which case, Small Claims Court will be your only recourse of getting the money she owes.", "NTA - She literally failed at dog ownership at the very first hurdle! She seems more worried about her bill than the fact she caused the death of an animal so yeah she has to pay.", "INFO: Wouldn't all of this be stipulated in the payment arrangement contract?", "NTA. It's not your fault that the dog did not live long. If this were any other purchase, she would of course be on the hook for it regardless of whether she cares for the item well or for how long she uses it. It was inappropriate of her to expect you to waive all her pending fees. If she doesn't want to be reminded each month she should pay her balance in full.", "Last payment should be once they claim the puppy", "NTA. but maybe you should offer up the dogs as soon as the mom is pregnant and start the payments before the pups leave.", "YTA  for offering  her another dog. She couldn't be bothered to take pup to the vet for shots???", "INFO - Who is the boss? It sounds like you are a junior in the family business with mom or dad being the boss of the family business.\n\nWhich makes me wonder why mom didn't inquire, console and deal with the woman with the dead puppy herself, since she's been doing this for 25 years.", "NTA.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, this is pretty simple: she financed a purchase, agreeing to make payments. Her negligence caused the puppy to be killed because she exposed it to a dog park without having it fully vaccinated, even though you explicitly told her to avoid such places until the puppy was fully vaccinated. She still owes the purchase price.\n\nLegally, this is no different than if she had purchased a car and decided to race down an icy road, causing her to wreck and total the car. Her negligence would have caused the wreck. Her bill is still outstanding.\n\nBUT it may be a good idea to put something into your contracts so that it is very clearly spelled out that they are responsible for the full puppy price if they are making payments and the dog dies due to their negligence. You obviously had the paperwork showing you delivered a healthy puppy to her.", "Why the fuck would you offer her another puppy?! she's clearly too irresponsible to own an animal. She might as well have old yeller the dog herself. How hard is it to get some damn vaccines before you take your new puppy around other dogs and out to the world. smh. \n\nNTA but you would be the AH if you give her another puppy.", "NTA for having to pay, but some of this is odd.  I\u2019ve never heard of avoiding grass. Like how is that even a thing? Are they not potty trained to go outside?\n\nI hope your pups get their first round of vaccines before going home.  \n\nAvoiding unvaccinated dogs is good (so dog parks, pet stores, etc), just a blanket statement of \u201cavoid grass\u201d is lousy and unrealistic advice, at that point I can see people ignoring it (because it\u2019s not realistic!) but you didn\u2019t bother to tell them what\u2019s important.  You would be the AH (and irresponsible breeders) if you didn\u2019t change what you say.", "Everyone sucks here - you don't sound like a responsible breeder and quite frankly if people are allergic to something they should avoid it not get one least likely to give them a reaction", "NTA for telling her she still has to pay, but YTA massively for offering her another puppy when you know for a fact that she is not suited to be a dog owner.", "No. This woman was negligent, and caused the death of the puppy. She did not follow the proper care the puppy needed to thrive. Do not offer her another dog. That dog will be at risk too. \n\nYTA. The woman for not taking proper care of the dog. And ultimately being responsible for its death.\n\nYTA. And you for your disregard for the danger another puppy be in, if you sold her a new dog. You already know she was ultimately responsible for the death of the first puppy. And you go and offer to sell her another? Do you honestly care, at all, for the puppies? Or are they just a pay check for you? Your negligence here is disgusting. \n\nGet the money you are owed, and then blacklist her. Make sure you inform other breeders about her.", "Esh\n\nNot only did she not do the basic care you told her, she actively ignored it and endangered the dog to the point where they passed.\n\nYou are an ah because knowing all that, you still offered her another dog, making it seem like you don't care about the dogs, its just business.", "ESH. Clearly the customer is for being unable to follow simple instructions that may have cost the pup it's life, and probably for delaying vet care until it was too late. You are for letting your curiosity get the best of you. The customer had already been in contact with your mother, so there was no need for you to jump in right away and question the customer over what happened. You should have discussed next steps with your mother first, because now you may have created an issue for her at work.", "YTA I'm sorry but you do NOT sound like a reputable breeder. You might not be a puppy mill but you're a backyard breeder I'd say. So...yeah YTA. This is what happens when you don't know how to properly sell dogs.", "Hmmm, never heard of a breeder taking payment plans. A deposit yes but a whole payment plan? Couldn\u2019t she easily get the card cut off (unless y\u2019all go by checking account) even then she can have that account closed. If they can\u2019t afford the dog in cash they should just put it on a credit card. That\u2019s what I did when I got my pup. I don\u2019t understand how a dog can die so easily, it\u2019s not that hard to keep a dog alive. I\u2019ve heard of owners who never take their dog to the vet and give them their shots themselves. Seems like a freak accident or an unfortunate accident with the dog.", "NAH - It was insensitive but she could have paid off the whole dog at once so she wouldn\u2019t have to be reminded each month.\n\nHer recklessness got the poor puppy killed so I probably wouldn\u2019t have offered to let her get another. But it doesn\u2019t relieve her of her financial obligations to your business.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
