He is from the UK, which has just as many financial opportunities as the US, just not in his line of work, unfortunately. His dating record would not indicate that he is specifically trying to get a Green Card.\n\nI think he is definitely taking advantage of my financial stability, but as long as I put down strong boundaries, we don't seem to have problems.

Probably. But I don't think anyone would bat an eye if the roles were reversed. I have a PhD in my field; I love what I do and I definitely don't want to be a SAHM. My company is far, far away from my family, so him being a stay at home parent could potentially be smart, financially. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think any of it is malicious. I think he is genuinely an ex-rich kid who hasn't realized that he isn't rich any more. However, I do appreciate you bringing these items up. \n\nThe other issue here is that I definitely want my own children, and I'm mid-30s. Dating in the US has been such a shitshow and I have no time to waste on men who say they want kids and want to get married but are incapable of committing, which has been my experience for the last 5+ years.

I think you're so focused on the wanting kids part and him meeting your other requirements that you're overlooking his one big, glaring red flag! Moving to the US on your dime is not the answer. He needs to be self-motivated enough to figure out a way to move to the US on his own dime.
