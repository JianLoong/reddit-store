Part of our agreement is that the house will be in her name when she pays me in full and I will be able to use the guest room 2x a year (2-3 days) even if they are not home at that time. They agreed, because nowhere would they accept this deal without extremely high fees, plus the house was nice. All of this in a contract protecting both parties. \n\nIt's always the same dates, my  aunt and mother's birthday and another annual event in the city that I love. \n\nThe home has 4be/2ba. \n\nWhen visiting, I try not to disturb and not cause a mess, but it's not worth staying in a hotel, because it's expensive (tourist region) \n\nIt's been five years and my daughter had my other two grandchildren (4M and 2F). \n\nI was recently talking to my daughter and I remembered that I would be staying at her house for 2 days for the city event. \n\nShe seemed quiet and started saying that the boys wanted their own rooms and ended up giving the guest room to the oldest (6M), so there was no room for me and she thinks it's unfair to have to ask him to sleep on the mattress with his own ro. So I had the option of sleeping on the mattress or paying for the hotel. \n\nI asked if the bed was still the same as in the guest room. She said yes and when I asked if she would pay for my hotel she said no.\n\n Btw, I have a Lot of pain back and would end me sleeping on the mattress (she knows that).\n\n I was disappointed and said I thought it was disrespectful for her to even mention these options to me when we have our agreement.\n\n She started saying that it was her house and she could decide who would sleep where because of that. \n\nThis bothered me and I reminded her that the house is still technically mine until she pays me the full amount and that our agreement was that I could use the guest room 2x a year and that my grandson is young, does not have back pain that would not get worse if he sleeps on the maitress.\n\nShe got angry saying that the reality is different now and she has 3 children, so I should understand her side that my request is not fair, considering that at the time she didn't have so many children and the reality is different now. \n\nShe  still angry  that if I have to sleep in the hotel, she will have to pay. \n\nAITA?\n\nSorry for my english", "created_utc": 1669302667, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3mde3/aita_for_pointing_out_that_my_daughters_house_is/", "score": 8309, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We all shuffled rooms to accommodate guests when i was little, and i gave my bedroom to my visiting friends last summer because the bed there is bigger than the pull out in the second bedroom. Seriously what's wrong with people.\nNTA", "NTA\n\nObviously! You're just visiting for 2 fucking days!!! The kid can't sleep on an air mattress or the couch for two fucking days??? SERIOUSLY??? We always give up a bed in my house when my grandma would come to visit before we had our guest room. Of course she'll sleep in my bed and not on the goddamn couch for a weekend.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy reading some of these Y-T-A! She's not kicking the family out of the house for 2 days or at all, just wants the agreed upon bed for two nights!", "Nobody needs to sleep on the spare mattress, a 6 and a 4 can sleep in one bed, you get the guest room.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She is in breach of the agreement and she must remedy that breach.   When you visit, you get that room. And she has to double her kids up. What are we talking about here  2 visits a year? How big a hardship will that be? Your daughter appears to be quite the ingrate. If she is effectively kicking you out you are entitled to add the cost of hotels to her bill.", "NTA. Kids do great on air mattresses and it always felt like an exciting thing to me when I was little, to be sleeping on an air mattress. Your daughter sucks though, and it sounds like she\u2019s raising those kids to be as entitled as she is.", "NTA. You had an ironclad agreement. I think the kids should have their own rooms and you can stay there during your trips. You being there twice a year doesn't mean they can't have their own rooms. The agreement was a place to stay, not keeping it a guest room. A vast majority of people had to sleep on the couch/an air mattress when relatives came over. Your daughter is being a little dramatic.", "NTA if you staying there 2x per year is written into the agreement. Your daughter can\u2019t renegotiate the contract without your consent.", "NTA. You had a deal. However many kids she has is irrelevant. They can share a room while you're visiting. If she stonewalls you on this, call in the balance of the selling price, since she has voided the contract she made with you. If she has to choose between giving you the room for a few days or selling the house to pay you off, I guess she'd see your side a little better.", "NTA. 2-3 days sounds like a very reasonable amount of time for a 6yo to share a room or sleep on a mattress when his grandmother is visiting. \n\nThat said, it is also not enough reason to use the ownership of the house as an argument to control what happens in it. That could be a last resort in a very bad case but it is very harsh to consider it after one minor issue.\n\nEdit: Last resort, not resource", "NTA\nShe\u2019s insane -you only ask to stay in guest room twice a year and she pays no downpayment and no interest?! That\u2019s worth paying the hotel fees if she\u2019s that worried about making her son sleep on a mattress. When my grandparents came to stay at our house, you better believe we wouldn\u2019t be making them sleep on a mattress while any of us took a bed. That\u2019s just basic respect for your elders, even if it wasn\u2019t your house!! NTA!", "NTA. And remember, this is going to happen twice a year for the next 10 years", "What is with all the people not wanting their kids to \u201cgive up their room\u201d when relatives come to visit? That was a given when anyone visited our house, someone was giving up their room for the guests and bunking in one of the siblings rooms. Is that not a normal thing? \nNTA btw", "When my mom came to visit us in our home, she slept in my daughter's bed and my daughter (7) slept with my husband and I. And she stayed for little over a week. I can't believe this is even a conversation. Her son can't sleep with his brother or on a matress for 2 days? That's crazy. Even if the house buying wasn't a thing, it's absolutely not the way you treat your parents.", "Nta. I didn't necessarily like it but we always gave up our bed when grandparents stayed the odd occasion. When I was 6 I didn't really care, probably thought it would have been cool to sleep on an air mattress.", "NTA, your daughter is doing rent to own, and is breaching your contract as the owner. There\u2019s no reason your grandson can\u2019t give up his room for a couple of nights.", "NTA. You had a contract agreement. 2x a year you get the room. Your daughter doesn't just get to change that.", "NTA. You two have a contract. The contract doesn't change, just because she has chosen to enlarge her family. She obviously got a very good deal on the house and should be grateful. I would insist that she pays for the hotel. Staying with your daughter would be uncomfortable for you under the current circumstances. Failing that, your daughter could always pay up the house in full.", "NTA.  You both made an agreement and it's in a contract.  She can't unilaterally decide to change the terms of the agreement because \"reality is different now\".  She should have come to you and said what was happening and tried to work with you as to how to change the agreement.  I also agree her son could sleep on the couch for a couple of nights. \n\nThat said it's kind of an AH thing for you to hang this on your daughter but overall I give you the benefit because she knew the terms and should have approached you to discuss.", "NTA because you have a contractual agreement that you gave her good rates in exchange for use of the house twice a year. \n\nMy guess is that paying for a hotel for you is still going to be less additional funds than she would have had to pay on the open market. But I imagine paying for an entire house over just 15 years has left them without much spare money. \n\nMany of us put our kids into one room when family come to stay, so it would seem the ideal solution would be to shuffle the kids around so you get a room. Your daughter could frame it as a sleepover, or if that\u2019s not acceptable, make arrangements for the children to have an actual sleepover with a friend.", "NTA\nYou gave her the opportunity to buy the house which it sounds like she would not have been able to afford under conventional means.\n\n2x/yr twice a year use of the guest room (even if it is now a child\u2019s bedroom) is not an unreasonable request.\n\nThe children won\u2019t suffer from sharing a room for a couple of days.  Camp out in the siblings room?  We did that for fun when we were growing up (I\u2019m one of five).", "NtA. I have a solution: your daughter sleeps on the air mattress. Problem solved.", "NTA. Your daughter accepted the generous terms you laid out in exchange for the home. She would not be able to own a home otherwise. If you renege on the terms of your mortgage, you go into foreclosure. If she\u2019s no longer willing to abide by these terms, she can get a conventional loan through the bank or move.", "Yeah NTA. I don't get the E S H\n\nFirst off, people saying you aren't her landlord, you're at best her mortgage lender... sure. Let's follow this line of reasoning. In essence, OP sold the house to their daughter for money and the right to stay a combined 1.5 weeks at the house every year. That's the payment. You may not agree to it, but that's functionally part of OP's contractually obligated payment that daughter is skimping out on.\n\nSecond, it's not like OP is robbing daughter or manipulating daughter. OP sold the house for what sounds like all around a sweetheart deal money wise and potentially lost tens of thousands of dollars she could have gotten going market value. OP saved daughter money and is \"recuperating\" the lost income from selling the house so cheap by not having to pay for the hotel when they visit. It makes sense.\n\nThird, throwing a contract at somebody is NEVER an AH move if they are absolutely not obeying it. People need to get out of this \"family doesn't need contracts\" mindset. They exist to protect everyone. You hope for the best but prepare for the worst with contracts. OP wouldn't have had to threaten the contract if daughter had just followed the stipulations.\n\nFourth, daughter really should have planned better. Invested in a pullout mattress maybe. But worse comes to worst, put the kid on an air mattress. I did it for upwards of a year for family. Kids will survive for 12 or so days a year on one. Meanwhile, OP is old with back problems and an air mattress is actively detrimental to their health\n\nWas OP a bit brash? Maybe. But in no way were they an AH.", "NTA - \n\nI was usually the person who had to give up my room for a day or two if there were guests over, and the only problem I would ever have with it is if I would not be given notice, or if it was too many days in a row. You have both let them know ahead of time and are barely staying more than a night. \n\nIt would be nice to teach the children hospitality.", "NTA tell her you are happy to renegotiate the contract, as she clearly believes she is being treated unfairly.  If she wants the house to be in her name and her rules then charge her proper interest like she would be getting charge on an actual loan. \n\nShe can't have it both ways. I think either way she will think you are T A.  Yes, I understand that her situation has changed, but the fact is, this current deal is saving her a lot of money & and for the smal sacrifice of giving you a bed for a few days.", "NTA - she knew what she signed up for.\n\nIf she doesn't want her kid to sleep on an air mattress, she can offer up her own bed.", "NTA. The boys are young, why can\u2019t they share a room or share a bed for a few nights? Or even have a slumber party and put the air mattress in the other kids room or living room? That\u2019s rude as to ask an elderly person to sleep on an air mattress.", "NTA. My parents visit me and have ZERO stakes in my house... and my kids still give up their bedrooms for them when they visit. My kids are all teens now.", "NTA. How would she like it if you went back on your part of the agreement and added fees to the monthly payment to cover having to stay in a hotel? Betting she would throw a fit if any changes to the agreement didn't benefit her in some way. Also, many, many 6 year olds would see sleeping on an air mattress as something fun, especially if the adults presented it as something special like getting to \"camp\" in the living room and maybe throwing in some extras to go with it like getting to watch an extra half hour of tv or something.", "NTA, your daughter refuses to see how much of a non issue it is. It's just for a couple of a days, so your grandson should go into another room for awhile, I always thought that was fun when I was younger", "NTA - \n\nI was so ready to go Y T A when I read the title BUT \n\n1. You\u2019re only staying for 2 days\n\n2. You took on great financial risk to do a FAVOR for your daughter and her family and all you ask in return is to be able to use a BED for 4 days a year?!!! I wish my parents were this generous!\n\n3. The kids are young. Set up a tent in the living room and pretend they\u2019re camping and make it fun like a sleepover. They will be ok if they\u2019re inconvenienced for a few nights.\n\n4. Your daughter signed a contract and is now angry she has to honor it?! Nope. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nYou made the details of the agreement perfectly clear before you \u201csold\u201d her the house. Her children are quite young and are perfectly fine sleeping in a bed together, couch or air mattress. \n\nMy mother has a bad knee and back problems. I can\u2019t even *fathom* her visiting and me saying \u201chey my **toddler** wants his own room so sleep on the air mattress, cool?\u201d But add on the amazing gift (yes. A huge house in a tourist area essentially rent to own with no down payment or interest *is* a gift) you gave her and her pulling this shit is unacceptable.", "NTA. She knew the agreement and now she wants to break it. Also, there\u2019s nothing wrong with young siblings sharing a room twice a year. Yeah, she can deal with this when you visit, or she can get you a room. You\u2019re not being unreasonable.", "NTA. Seems like a simple solution- she and husband sleep on the air mattress and you  take the master twice a year. Or do they simply not want the house and are looking for a \"story we tell ourselves\" to break the contract with you and make you the bad guy that makes them move?", "NTA. She needs to pony up the money for your hotel. \n\nYour daughter has quickly forgotten what her situation would be like had you not housed her.", "So the six-year-old can't spend a couple of nights on the couch while grammy is visiting.\n\nDang, build the kid a fort in the living room for a couple of nights.\n\nThese first-world problems cause so much family discourse.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a weird hill for your daughter to die on, whenever we had my grandparents over I had to give up my room because the bed was more comfortable. A bit annoying but absolutely no problem at all. I simply don\u2019t get the issue.", "Even if you didn't own the house, isn't it normal to accommodate the grandparents? When I was growing up I always had to vacate my room whenever they'd visit. You have it in a contract which your daughter is breaking.\n\nNTA", "OMG. You are so NTA.  Regardless of what your deal was, who makes their mom sleep on an air mattress so their 6 year old can sleep in their own room?\n\nWhere does your grandson sleep when he spends the night at friends and families homes?  Kids that age usually think I fun to sleep in the living room or on mom and dad's bedroom floor.\n\nMy kid camps out with me when people spend the night.  He loves it.\n\nThe only way I could see your daughter's side is if all of her children were special needs and any sort of change to their schedule and surroundings causes chaos and meltdowns.  Other than that, she is just being rude.\n\nIf she doesn't want to abide by your previous agreement, then she needs to get a mortgage from the bank like the rest of us homeowners.  \n\nAlso, the house being in your name is a liability for you.  God forbid something happen and you end up in lawsuit because of an accident on your property.  It would be you who is liable.  Sure the homeowners insurance would cover it, but your insurance would sky rocket after.", "NTA:  When I was little we kids always got tossed into the basement with sleeping bags.  We took advantage too.  TV, bathroom, and the entire basement to ourselves?  Hell yea!  The daughter is breaking an agreement she made years ago.  She needs to honor it.", "NTA, a 6 year old can move for a few days. I did that all the time as a kid when grandparents would visit.", "NTA.  You had an agreement,  but even outside of this, what is with parents these days who don't teach their kids the concepts of sharing, compromise, and respect?\n\nMaybe it's an income thing, but I don't know a single family where kids with separate rooms (assuming their home even has space for separate rooms)  don't occasionally bunk together, stay on an air mattress, or crash in the living room or basement for a short time for visiting adult friends or relatives.  It's simply a part of life--we don't make the old folks with back issues sleep on the sagging couch!    But like I said, maybe it's an income thing as I don't hang out with a lot of wealthy folks.\n\nAnd when this is handled appropriately, much of the times kids don't resent it--they enjoy it, as a sleepover, or a chance to build and sleep in your own little fort in the attic, maybe get to stay up a little later or watch a movie, whatever...   \n\nYeah, bringing up ownership seems to me to be the last option, but daughter is being an AH IMO so I'm not going to fault OP for her response.", "NTA. She is taking advantage of you. She could have told her son that the condition of having his own bedroom is that he had to give it to you when you are in town. She is making you the bad guy.", "Perhaps it\u2019s time for your daughter and SIL to get a mortgage on the house and pay you off. \nNo more arguments. NAH", "It\u2019s been five years, if she wants out of the deal she could get a mortgage or personal loan and pay him off now. But she doesn\u2019t want to or can\u2019t, which means there\u2019s still some benefit to the bargain she made. Kid moves, he gets his room. I\u2019m also sure she isn\u2019t paying income tax on her no interest or below AFR loan.", "NTA,  the agreement apart, it's just downright disrespectful to expect an older relative to sleep on an inflatable mattress when there's kids in a bed. When we were kids we slept on blankets and cushions on the floor often when relatives visited and we loved it...it was an adventure. You have raised an entitled daughter ....she certainly doesn't remember thst she wouldn't even have a house but for your agreement.", "[deleted]", "NTA, a six year old is totally fine on an air mattress for two nights. I gave up my room as a child when family was in town for a few days plenty of times and I\u2019m totally fine. It would be a different story if it was whenever you wanted as often as you wanted, or for an extended time, but a couple of nights? No, that agreement is perfectly fine. If your daughter thinks it\u2019s not fair for only one kid to give up their room, she can either have them switch who sleeps on the air mattress each visit, or her sons can share a room for a weekend. No big deal. They could even make a blanket fort or something for him to sleep in, and it would be fun.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYou did a huge favour to your daughter with this agreement. \n\nHer situation may have changed but the contract or the initial agreement has not.  \n\nI regularly slept on a mattress in different parts of the house growing up and I didn't hate doing it.   \n\n\nShe should be more accommodating", "NTA. She should pay for your hotel room.\n\nI mean, this contact sounds like trouble from the beginning, but if that\u2019s been the agreement for five years, that shows agreement on her part.", "NTA when I was a kid I got \"nans room\" when I moved out of my shared room from my twin. Whenever nan came I went and shared with my twin again. Whether u still own the house or not, I was brought up to respect my elders and even when I grew up into my own house she had my bed if she came to visit.", "Nta. You have her a great deal and part of it is that you get to stay twice a year. Your daughter can give you her room if she doesn't want to bother her children.", "NTA - \n\n>She started saying that it was her house and she could decide who would sleep where because of that.\n\nBut it isn't, now is it? Your requests are completely reasonable. She is being pig-headed. Heck my own IL's visit us 2-3 times per year and stay at our home. There is no question that they get the kids' rooms. They're both in their 70s and I wouldn't expect them to sleep on a floor or couch. \n\nMy kids love it because they get to sleep in the family room those nights and set up their pillows, blankets, etc. there and have a fun little \"sleepover.\"", "NTA just ask you daughter what the contract says.", "Even if it wasn't your house before and all that... My family taught us to treat visits with all respect and consideration possible, I'd give my bed in any given moment and sleep in the living room without throwing a fit, don't see why they're acting this way specially with your back pain. Getting a home without down payment? Wow, the dream come true for any millennial. NTA btw, your daughter is, you got an agreement way beforehand.", "NTA. If she\u2019s okay with breaking her side of the agreement she can\u2019t get upset if you end up breaking your side. However even if there was no agreement and you didn\u2019t own the house, I can\u2019t even IMAGINE putting my mom on an air mattress instead of moving a toddler to another room for a few nights.", "I'd likely have a different verdict if firstly you didn't have a contract and also if you were charging her fees, but your daughter is getting a massive help/discount from you by not having to pay interest.\n\nPlus it's twice a year, it's like like it's twice a month. Plus if she has such an issue with her son sleeping on a air mattress she can give up her bed and she sleep on the air mattress. Hell, if I had this agreement I'd sleep on an air mattress for not having to pay interest on buying a house. NTA", "NTA \n\nWhy couldn't your daughter set up part of the living room as a \"blanket fort\" for the kids? They'd love it and you could probably take your pick of their rooms.", "NTA. Your daughter made the agreement and she needs to keep it. She can move the youngest in with her or pay for your hotel. She knew how many rooms the house had when she was popping those kids out so she needs to either pay for your hotel with the money she\u2019s saving on this interest and fee free loan, make  a room available or pay the balance outstanding on the loan immediately so you have no rights over the house. If she had made this agreement with a stranger would she be able to tell them to go elsewhere?", "Absolutely NOT the asshole. It doesn't even matter who owns the home. It's standard practice that young children bunk elsewhere when grandma comes to visit.", "NTA\n\n\nYour entitled daughter is definitely TA.\n\nYou can get a lawyer involved if she's not following the agreement. Or kick her out of the house and rent it out or even air bnb. You would make way more money that way and you wont have to give up your house in the end. \n\n\nIf she wants to act entitled then she can go and find another house to buy or rent.", "Ask your daughter if the children will each have their own rooms in their new house.", "NTA\n\nYou have a contact stating the terms. If she wants to break those terms that's fine but she can start looking for another home.", "NTA When family come to stay with me, either my kids or myself make accommodations. They bunk in with me, or each other, or we stay on the air mattresses. Even without the complication of the house situation the daughter would be the AH for asking her mother to sleep on an air mattress in a 4 bedroom house while small children have their own rooms.", "I don\u2019t think you are ta. You made a agreement with her. Plus her children are young, they can share a bedroom for a few days. And you have back pain.", "NTA. Your daughter chose to have more children than she had bedrooms for at all times, knowing the agreement she signed full well. She got a sweetheart of a deal and needs to follow through on her end.", "NTA, 2 of the boys can share a room for 2 nights. Yes, things changed, but the contract didn't.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA due purely to the fact that she signed a contract. She knew about the contract that she signed when she had more children and she knew about it when she decided that for whatever reason a 6 and 4 yo couldn\u2019t share a room. If it were a casual agreement and she communicated about it, I\u2019d say you were being a hardass, but she signed a legal document and then chose not to honor it", "NTA. A deal is a deal. If she wants out of it, she can call your lawyer.", "NTA, my family always gave up the kids rooms for traveling family. It was never a burden. Also this is basically a contract so\u2026", "NTA. There\u2019s a contract, one that needs to be held up.", "NTA you had clear rules and guidelines for being allowed to buy the house. I was thinking it would be Y T A but you\u2019re asking for 2-3 days not even in a row throughout the year.

Regardless of the ownership arrangement, grandkid can sleep on a mattress for a couple days when grandma is visiting.", "NTA that seems like such a reasonable  arrangement,  clearly laid out.  Set up a pup tent in one of the other kid's rooms or the basement or living room for the kiddo, throw down the air mattress and call it an adventure.  If he can't handle a different room (some kids really can't), move one of the other kids and use that bed.  This shouldn't be complicated, she's got a golden housing arrangement in a time when many don't have housing at all.  Honoring the agreement should be simple.", "This was always going to be a problem.\n\n She and husband should give up their room to you for 2 days. Far less disruptive that way. they knew the arrangement, it was their choice to grow the family.", "Posters seem to be treating this more as a legal issue? Even if she did own the house your daughter is horribly disrespectful.", "NTA it was an agreement in order for her to buy the house. That\u2019s be like you deciding to tell her the house will be paid in full next year abs to take a loan for the lump sum now (with soaring interest rates). When you start messing with the agreement you are putting the other party out. \n\nAlso who doesn\u2019t let the kid take the air mattress while parents visit. My husband and I always offered our parents our bed. They didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that so we have our teenagers two twins in a room when they visit and those two basically have a sleepover in the living room on the couches or in on of their rooms on air mattresses. They\u2019ve done this for years and sometimes they gripe but they would never let their grandparents sleep on the floor or air mattress either because they aren\u2019t entitled jerks. \nMaybe let her know the agreement has been kept on your side but if she can change things in a whim you could too.", "NTA In my family, it is totally normal for the kids to give up their room to allow adult guests to use the room. I gave up my room for my aunt and uncle, my cousins gave up their room for my parents, my kids gave up their room for visiting grandparents. And it was always made to be fun for the kids, with a tent and sleeping bags in the living room, or an air mattress in the siblings room, and they are allowed to watch movies or something.\n\nWhat I'm wondering though, is why your daughter is so entitled. Seems she was never taught the value of hospitality. That, OP, is on you.", "NTA. \nIf you\u2019re daughter wants to change the\nWritten contract, she can go to the bank to see if she qualifies for a traditional mortgage.  With traditional interest rates.  I bet that will change her disrespectful tone.", "All these Y T A are beyond ridiculous. There were clear terms when you sold her the house with no fees and over, I'm guessing at the very least, 10 years with no down payment. No shit you want to be able to see your elderly mom/aunt and visit your city twice a year without having to spend a bunch on a hotel. How fucking entitled do you have to be to expect a 6yo sleeping in an air mattress to be atrocious compared to telling grandma to fuck off after she gave you such a sweet deal and you decided to unilaterally change the terms. \n\nIt might be a Western thing where nuclear families mean anyone not in the very inmediate family circle is essentially a stranger, but in most cultures (even without the agreement in place nor the fact she is the reason you even have a house of your own) the normal thing would be for grandma to be able to visit and the kids give up the bed to the guest with back issues, duh. It might be an entitled white person thing, I did this even for family members I had a never even spoken to in my life that were in perfect health when they came to visit and never in a million years would I have thought to complain, it's what you do for guests and family at that. I'm so happy I got the chance to do so because it means I got to spend time with family from all over the world that I now get to visit and share with that I wouldn't have otherwise. Plus, it helped me learn how to be a good host and just a decent person in general so I would thankfully never pull something like what OP's daughter has. I would have had my ass beat with a chancla if I even _thought_ about holding it over the guest's head, which I would never have done anyways because it's a rude thing to do.\n\nI know not everyone is as lucky/privileged as me to have such amazing and supportive family where it goes both ways and I know they would always do the same for me, I don't believe in the \"but it's faaaaaaamily\" bullshit unless it's earned, but considering they'd otherwise still be renting and all it takes is letting the grandma have a fucking room for a week or two a year I'd say it's pretty safe to say she's earned some basic decency, ie not deciding to change the terms on your own.\n\nNTA all the way, your daughter sounds entitled as hell and I just hope your grandchildren don't end up the same way.", "NTA\n\nMy kids are happy to sleep on an air mattress and have grandma sleep in their beds.

Part of our agreement is that the house will be in her name when she pays me in full and I will be able to use the guest room 2x a year (2-3 days) even if they are not home at that time. They agreed, because nowhere would they accept this deal without extremely high fees, plus the house was nice. All of this in a contract protecting both parties. \n\nIt's always the same dates, my  aunt and mother's birthday and another annual event in the city that I love. \n\nThe home has 4be/2ba. \n\nWhen visiting, I try not to disturb and not cause a mess, but it's not worth staying in a hotel, because it's expensive (tourist region) \n\nIt's been five years and my daughter had my other two grandchildren (4M and 2F). \n\nI was recently talking to my daughter and I remembered that I would be staying at her house for 2 days for the city event. \n\nShe seemed quiet and started saying that the boys wanted their own rooms and ended up giving the guest room to the oldest (6M), so there was no room for me and she thinks it's unfair to have to ask him to sleep on the mattress with his own ro. So I had the option of sleeping on the mattress or paying for the hotel. \n\nI asked if the bed was still the same as in the guest room. She said yes and when I asked if she would pay for my hotel she said no.\n\n Btw, I have a Lot of pain back and would end me sleeping on the mattress (she knows that).\n\n I was disappointed and said I thought it was disrespectful for her to even mention these options to me when we have our agreement.\n\n She started saying that it was her house and she could decide who would sleep where because of that. \n\nThis bothered me and I reminded her that the house is still technically mine until she pays me the full amount and that our agreement was that I could use the guest room 2x a year and that my grandson is young, does not have back pain that would not get worse if he sleeps on the maitress.\n\nShe got angry saying that the reality is different now and she has 3 children, so I should understand her side that my request is not fair, considering that at the time she didn't have so many children and the reality is different now. \n\nShe  still angry  that if I have to sleep in the hotel, she will have to pay. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's weird to sell your house to your daughter, but still call it your house, and expect her to keep a room empty for you for the 6-9 days per year you stay there, but it's also unnecessary for her to make a thing about it and to refuse to let you sleep in the room for those few days when you all agreed (and heck, even have a signed contract).

If she'd gone with a traditional mortgage, she would have owned her own home, even if she still had future payments. If she'd missed payments, I'd see your point, but you haven't said she has.

The kind of agreement you currently have is called a contract for deed in my jurisdiction (in the US), and I always recommend clients who come to me for that sort of deal to reconsider. Most people who own property and want to go with something like that seem to think that they'll have more protections if payments aren't made and can simply evict the other party, which isn't true (at least not here). You still have to go through the foreclosure process and the buyer is usually given some equity in the property at foreclosure. And it also leads to murky issues of ownership when situations like this arise. \n\nYour daughter might be in a better position to get a traditional mortgage now. Interest rates are high right now, but a lot of lenders are offering incentives like reduced closing costs to entice borrowers. And she can always refinance in a few years once rates come back down. \n\nIf she doesn't qualify, you can also basically sell her the home outright and refinance the rest of the amount she owes with you acting as a private lender. Charge her some interest and use that money to get a hotel room when you're in town. \n\nI definitely recommend speaking to a real estate attorney in your jurisdiction about solutions.", "It\u2019s the disrespect for me!

My kids ask for sleepovers often and it's a regular weekend thing for them to sleep in one of their rooms.

If she doesn\u2019t want to keep the contract op could return the payments and just sell the house.", "NTA\n\nI suggest that you suggest to your daughter that she tries to refinance the house with a traditional bank. Since presumably she has met the conditions of your agreement, this counts as \"seasoning\" the loan.  So a traditional bank might consider refinancing the deal.  \n\nHowever, since you have a non-traditional agreement, and apparently she's not paying fees, and the interest rates are currently pretty high, I doubt she'll like any deals she gets offered.\n\nGoing through the process of the bank to try to refinance the house will open her eyes, either they will qualify and agree to refinance the house which would finally put her in the position of actually owning the house like she wants to. Or she won't like the deals, or won't qualify for the deals, and maybe she'll have a little bit more grace with you.\n\nUltimately, if this becomes untenable, you can always sell the house.\n\n\np.s. you will need to come up with her payoff amount so she knows what she needs to finance. The bank will ask for this. Also she needs to provide proof that she's been paying on time, which she might need your help with.

Having secure housing is a powerful motivator and something that would be pretty damn hard to say no to, especially with a baby. OP used that to leverage to extract commitments from her kid.

No. But it probably says something about the nature of the relationship and makes me think that the daughter really does not enjoy spending time with her mom.\n\nOP says she sold the house to her daughter but she didn't really bc the house is still in OP's name.

Assholes.\n\nFinally, there's not a kind or considerate word about anyone else in this post. Nothing about how she loves visiting with her daughter and grandchildren.

They may not have defined it this way but that is what it is as the daughter is not on the deed. In no case can a landlord put in a contract that they can still use the property.

I mean that is what is normal and should certainly not need a contract to establish it.", ">If daughter wants to invalidate the agreement then it can all be invalidated and the last five years are now rental payments.\n\nThat's not how this works. In a standard land contract you gain equity along the term of the loan, but the Seller (OP) retains Legal Title until the contract is paid in full.

Adding weird clauses like staying over so many days a year is messy, indeed. \n\nI also agree that it is straight forward.

Honestly though, it's disrespectful when you have a contract saying they can do that. My sibling lives in a place co-owned with their father in law. The rule is he's allowed to come and stay when he's in town, and so they keep the guest room a guest room. My sibling's been working from home in the living room 2.5 years because they couldn't fit a bed in there if they made it into an office, and one of the owners needs a bed to be available in that room.

You\u2019d be able to draw up and sign this contract, but you wouldn\u2019t legally be able to enforce it.\n\nPlus mom was great at teaching us we have the right to say no. It didn\u2019t matter that we were renting or that mom was the name on the lease. What mattered was they this was *my* room; that meant it was *my responsibility* to keep it clean and presentable, *my responsibility* to organize or purge toys/clothes/whatever else when I run out of space to store everything, *my responsibility* to host *my guests* in there, and *my right* to say no to being kicked out for *someone elses* guest.\n\nI don\u2019t think they just shouldn\u2019t host OP, and I don\u2019t think they should put her on an air mattress when they know her body can\u2019t handle it. But I *do* think that OP is an asshole for thinking she can/should just boot the kids out of *their own rooms* or that they should share a room to keep a spare open for the like week out of a year that OP would be using it. If you have the space to give your kids their own rooms, it shouldn\u2019t even be a question of \u201cdo I let them have their own rooms or do I keep one empty for if grandma decides to come over?\u201d And every grandma that I know IRL would agree with that. \n\nWhat *should* be happening here is grandma should be thinking it makes complete sense for the kids to have their own rooms, she should stop pushing for her daughter to kick one of her grandchildren out of their room, and her daughter should either be giving up her room or getting a good futon that won\u2019t hurt grandma to sleep on.

No complaints from me! \n\nAnd many other years I've shared a bed with my other sibling since my uncle usually spends the holidays with us. Whoever wasn't sharing a bed that year would sneak down to the others' room and we'd all open our stockings (yes, my parents still fill our stockings up even though we're all adults) on the bed and compare goodies and trade chocolate. We'd wait there in our pjs until everyone else woke up. It was tradition! There was one year nobody had to share and two of us banded together to go to the other's room, because they were being a moody teenager and wouldn't get up, so we flicked the lights on and off until they agreed to do stockings.", "This is exactly what I was thinking.

It is unconceiveble that a landlord say that they can use the property in any means during all the time the tenant is paying. Only if tenant is evicted can they legally even enter the house again. \nHere they have mixed up landlord rights and mother rights. \nAs her landlord she YTA for making a contract like that ans saying that it is her house. NTA as her mother to expect to be able to stay in the guest bedroom and the kid on the matress for her stay. I think the reason they put the clause in was probably to protect the daughter from her mother coming to stay for weeks at a time every other month. But the contract for the rent to buy (even if they fidnt word it this way it is what it is) should not have contained such a clause and would likely be considered an illegal contract if it went in front of a judge. Yes its not because both parties have agreed that the contract is always legal. A very clear exemple of this is if someone gets someone else to sign a contract that says that they will only be paid 6\u00a3/euro/$ for 12 h of work. Even if the other person did agree, it is clearly exploitation, slavery and therefore is an illegal contract and is not binding. The person who wrote it may also face criminal charges in the exemple (not in this case).
