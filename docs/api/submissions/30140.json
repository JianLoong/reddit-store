This is a personal debt he feels obligated to pay, it\u2019s not something that is to a bank or rent or even taxes. \n\nIt\u2019s because he is a good person, or feels guilty.  Which he should pay back, however he has the luxury of not needing to do so right away because it\u2019s not a real debt.\n\nNever once did OP say the ex is requesting the money. It\u2019s clearly he feels bad.\n\nThis would be completely different if it was a debt to a bank, taxes, etc or if the ex needed the money/ was asking for it.\n\nPeople are reading too much into these.", "No, a) you have no way of knowing that and are speculating, b) it\u2019s not something he contractually signed or obligated himself to as such it is and would be considered a gift and thus he is not legally required to pay.\n\nTherefore if his ex tried to sue it would have to be in small claims court and it wouldn\u2019t hold any water. She would have to prove he signed something saying it would be paid back or if he is in a state where verbal agreements are contracts then provide proof of that conversation or his acknowledgment.\n\nThe simple answer is no, she can\u2019t and you know nothing of the law and are projecting.", "She had to have mom and dad pay her student loans, she can\u2019t afford a house.", "Show me where I said to abandon the debt. I. SAID. All three of then should have communicated. \\*HE\\* incurred the debt before the relationship. The EX has not pressed the issue. The WIFE is talking about his current responsibilities. Rather than putting ALL resources towards his mistake... I said conversation should happen. I never said anything about abandoning the debt!", "I bet she would feel very differently if someone owed her thousands of dollars though...", "It's about the money. The rest are just nonsense to OP.", "Turns out they aren't even struggling. OP made a comment how she wants to own a home first before paying back the ex. So they can afford it, OP just rather save money then fix a debt.", "Her username checks out \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThe real kicker is her argument is she doesn't want him to pay off his debt, so they can take on more debt.", "I read knutty territory and thought of Mrs Nut from candyland", "It wasn\u2019t just repairs. Op also said the ex covered his rent \u201ca few times\u201d. That could be 2-3xs or 6+ times. Ambiguous wording.", "Between car repairs and a few months of rent it could be $5-$10k or more if they live in a HCOL. If OP and husband are now living somewhere cheaper that could definitely make the difference on a down payment.", "I'm not sure anyone should be buying a house in this economy. Mortgage rates are through the roof. Most people are going to be better off continuing to rent until rates come down.", "And yet... he can afford therapy? That was really a kicker. I mean, MAYBE it's covered by insurance, but that's so unusual (in my state, anyway).", "Might as well, they're already paying her debt", "That\u2019s exactly my point. I\u2019m a millennial homeowner and I was not prepared for the real cost of owning a home. It feels never ending but where I live buying an older home and renovating comes out much better so I\u2019m sucking it up. But there is no way I will be in a position to pay any body back for at least another 2 years. All my money goes into renovations and interior design so I\u2019m super glad I cleared everything up before I became a homeowner.", "So true if they can\u2019t get a down payment together easily they DO NOT want to own a home yet", "She said in the post that they both work and their child is in daycare.", "Judging by everything in her post, I don't think they're even seriously looking at buying. I think she's just using that as an excuse here to be complaining about the money. They both work, pay childcare, parents are paying off her loans! Why wouldn't they be able to afford a few thousand. But instead she's here complaining as if a few thousand is going to have any relevance whatsoever on their ability to buy a house. She seems like a spoiled princess who doesn't have a clue how the world works, let alone buying a home in your early 20s.", "op\u2019s username checks out, Shoddy-Principle is an apt description. YTA op", "Also, OPs comments, she skirts around admitting it but it's there", "Her not saying that they were broken up is all I needed to know she was a side chick. Ex probably found out dumped him so he moved in with OP. Him playing his ex back is showing her he is maturing.", "Also if they rekindled after she completed her bachelors, things moved really fast. She\u2019s 23 now, likely graduated at 21 at the earliest assuming a 3 year degree, and they\u2019ve had time to \u201crekindle\u201d, elope, and produce a child. \n\nHer mom probably took her side because it probably sucks to find out that, while you\u2019re helping with her student loans, he\u2019s planning to pay back other debt, and want him to support their daughter and grandchild instead. Hardly neutral.", "I think the guy got probably stuck with her.", "The minute they move into the house she's looking at, she'll cheat and divorce him, taking the house and the kid and destroying the dude's life. He deserves it too for cheating on his ex", "She won\u2019t deny it", "Yea but if he's already working on paying her back, the court would just make him do what he's already doing.", "In her comments basically", "What you don't seem to get is that a debt is a debt.  It doesn't matter if it is money owed to a bank or an individual.  Why do you think this isn't a \"real debt\" and this man has the \"luxury\" of not needing to pay it back right away?  \n\nI feel sorry for anyone that lends you money", "So because the ex is a kind person they get the shit stick?\n\nIf I was ex (and willing to be patient about someone paying me back) I would still be absolutely pissed if they came to me and said that. \u201cI can\u2019t pay you back now because I\u2019m buying a house.\u201d OP and husband can fuck all the way off with that BS.\n\nOwing money is an OBLIGATION \nFeeding your kid is an OBLIGATION \nBuying a house is a WANT", "Ex will never see the money if they buy a house first. It\u2019ll always be something. A new roof, plumbing, electrical, etc. And it will always be because \u201cthat\u2019s best for our family\u201d. OP is so selfish and doesn\u2019t realize her having a kid isn\u2019t ex\u2019s problem", "OP probably logged into another account to make that comment, lol.", "Definitely, she sounds like a stingy little thing.", "Right? The guy is starting to realize he fucked up by getting back with op and eloping and having a baby in such a short time.

Her replies/comments are even more delusional.", "If it\u2019s not a: no way we cheated, it\u2019s a yes.", "It's also kinda showing ops immaturity. Does she think that if he pays his ex back, it'll open a line of communication, however small, that eventually he'll leave the side piece and go back with his ex?", "Weird to say this of a cheater, but he isn\u2019t as rotten as OP.", "It doesn\u2019t have weight on the situation because either way he owes her the money and needs to pay her back. \nHowever it again shows how inconsiderate and selfish you are, at least he\u2019s trying to do this right despite fucking up there.", "     Let\u2019s say that happened\n\nThen he\u2019s a man of low moral character and it\u2019s not a surprise that he might try to get out of paying his debt.", "I\u2019m so glad you won this prize.\n\nHe\u2019s an AH.

If he had had to take out  a loan to fix his car or put it on his cc he would've had to pay it back a long time ago unless he wanted to incur paying a lot of interest.
