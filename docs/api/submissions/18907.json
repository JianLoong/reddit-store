My family just told me to give them a heads up in the future because they might want to change plans if a baby is coming.

It at least give them wiggle room to accommodate or discuss a change of plans. \n\nYour father reaction seems like it\u2019s one sided. He\u2019s looking at a portion of a big picture. He\u2019s not considering the fact that it\u2019s you and three other adults taking care of the child and it\u2019s giving your SIL the time to heal herself properly. If you don\u2019t feel any burden was placed upon you then I\u2019m not sure why they have an issue. Your family should support your decision to lend a helping hand.", "NAH  It sound more like a miscommunication/lack of communication to me.\n\nYour family ASSUMED that baby was gonna be left behind and you ASSUMED that everyone knew you have a temporary sidekick.  After all, it has been a few months.\n\nYour dad's comments would hit a nerve with me. I am sure he is concerned for you and taking on too much, but ...there are a small amount of people see this as taking on \"other people's problems\". Not to mention nephew isn't their family, it's your husband's family.  So, back to \"other peoples problems\" and baby not belonging with your family events.\n\nSo now you know to ask if babykins can join in, or if the invite it just for you.", "YTA\n\nI understand that you're taking over a stand in mother now, but I think that its still important to communicate or even better, ask if your nephew can come. He's not a nephew on your family's side if that makes sense and I just think that bringing a child to a birthday dinner isn't appropriate without asking because he wasn't a factor in the equation when the plans were made. Would you bring him to a no kids allowed wedding or other event without asking just because his mom is in the hospital?", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter why you\u2019re in a parental role, right now, you still need to act like any respectful parent should and that means not assuming your child is welcome anywhere you feel like going. You need to ask first, and if the answer is no either get a sitter or respectfully decline.\n\nAnd your Dad was literally just expressing empathy for the difficult situation you\u2019re in.", "NTA, and I really can't fathom all the answers saying you are.\n\nYou've previously communicated to your family that you have taken on the primary care role of this baby.\n\nThat means the basic expectation is that he would come places with you.\n\nI would never, in a million years, invite a family member with a baby or small child to any family event and expect the baby/child to be excluded.\n\nIt is a given that primary caregiver is a package deal with a baby and all events would allow for that.\n\nBasic assumption is that baby comes unless the host explicitly communicates that no children are allowed. That's on the host, not on you.\n\nThey are definitely being the AHs to act like he doesn't count as family because he's not related to them by blood. WTAF.", "NTA. You and your husband and his family are wonderful to all step in and help. Your family sounds selfish. Good for you for not being like them and for helping. Bless you.", "NTA your family is dense, it is clear that y'all are a package deal and they should be giving you a heads up if kids aren't allowed. I'm baffled at all these YTAs, wild how ridiculous some people are about kids.", "I had the same response: What is wrong with people?  \n\n\nFamily isn't just blood relations...in fact, that quote about blood being thicker than water is a misquote. It really says \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.\"  \n\n\nYou and your ILs and husband go right on being kind, decent people, and ignore the rest. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA. They should be applauding your efforts to help your SIL instead of taking it as an inconvenience to themselves. You are to be commended for your generosity", "NTA they should be able to see that you and your family is in a tough spot right now. If they can\u2019t find some empathy that\u2019s on them. Maybe it\u2019s their guilty heads because they know they wouldn\u2019t do the same things. They should have known you\u2019d have the baby. Your family sucks.", "NTA\n\nwtf is wrong with them all? I mean...it's an infant. Seriously. wtactualf", "You are so NTA. Your nephew is lucky to have loving family to care for them vs entering foster care and shame on your family for not understanding", "NTA", "YTA for taking your nephew without forewarning - I don\u2019t take my children places without asking if that\u2019s ok with the person who invited me. It\u2019s just common courtesy. \n\nHowever you\u2019re definitely not an AH for taking on the role you have - I had two kids at your age. It\u2019s a lot for sure. It\u2019s selfless to care for someone else\u2019s baby whilst they recover - but you can\u2019t expect everyone around you to jump into the roles you expect without warning too\u2026", "NTA.  You're caring for the baby, as are other family members.  They should be thanking you not complaining.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nYou should have given a heads up. I never took step-children or my baby without letting the person issuing the invite know that I would like to bring kids. If they weren't good with that I either wouldn't go or I would GET A SITTER! Be reasonable, you don't need to nor should you take the baby to every event you attend, especially if it is a restaurant. At someone's home fine but not all restaurants are family friendly so be considerate.\n\nYou are not too young to take on or have a baby. It's great that you are able to step up and help but next time consider asking your in-laws if they will watch the baby. I doubt your friends will be any happier then your parents if you bring the baby without notice.", "YTA\n\nBut a soft one. You should have asked about bringing a baby. It sounds like it was an upscale restaurant, given that they said they would change plans if they knew the baby was coming. I\u2019m getting the feeling that they were looking forward to an adult night out. A child changes the dynamic of an all-adult gathering. \n\nMy guess is your father was expressing empathy to you in that he sees you sacrificing you time to take on someone else\u2019s baby. If so, yes it was badly said. \n\nBut even a bio parent should know better than to bring a baby to an all adult gathering, and should know when to have someone else watch the baby while you go out.  Next time, ask first before bringing the baby.", "YTA. This wasn\u2019t an emergency in which you had to bring your nephew. It was a planned dinner. If you and your husband are both caring for your nephew, it\u2019s not on your sister or family to assume you two are a package deal. It\u2019s not appropriate to bring an additional guest to a birthday dinner without asking. Also your father was trying to be supportive to you and you blew up on him.", "I hope SIL recovers soon.\n\nAs for the restaurant, yea in general you shouldn\u2019t assume babies or children are welcome to an adult event, especially a restaurant.\n\nSoft YTA", "YTA. \n\nI understand why you\u2019re watching him right now and its very noble of you. You need to still give people heads up when you bring your nephew to events. Especially events that weren\u2019t your own plans or that your nephew wasn\u2019t explicitly invited to, like your sister\u2019s birthday party.", "Soft YTA. Even parents of newborns have to sometimes arrange childcare if they\u2019re going out to more adult-only events. I guess you\u2019ve *now* communicated this to your family, but it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to be more transparent in advance. \n\nBut major, major kudos for stepping up in such a major way to take care of your SIL and your nephew. I hope your SIL is able to get some adequate compensation for the car accident. Also, have your family enquirer whether insurance would cover the costs of a FT carer while she recovers? Just a thought.", "YTA, I understand your situation but that doesn't mean you shouldn't have still notified them that you're bringing a kid. \n\nIf you and the nephew are a package deal, then the onus is on YOU to tell people that *before* accepting social outings.", "YTA. You said your husband and his parents have become fulltime caregivers. Even if you meant for SIL and not for baby, the baby's grandparents could have had him while you went to dinner. That's what your family expected and a heads up isn't much to ask since you do have options other than taking baby to a restaurant.", "I feel like it's both YTA and NTA I have a  question\nWere there other kids there or just adults?\nWhy couldn't your husband watch him?\n\nI feel like your nta bc you are doing something nice and taking care of your SIL kid and there the ah bc they should be more understanding of the situation. But you TA bc you should have given them a heads up bc there could have been lots of things going on or they just didn't want a kid around. Probably getting away from there own kids. I just feel like there was misunderstandings and miscommunication", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your family should be proud of you for stepping up, not acting like it\u2019s a problem.", "NTA they are stuck up\n\n\nIt takes a village and they are not kosher", "Gentle YTA. I AM a new parent and I regularly check if it's alright to bring my newborn to events. You're doing a good thing by helping, but your obligation doesn't get to dictate other people's recreation. \n\nAlso, because of how you've phrased some things - I hope you're taking time to have your own space and social time without the kid from time to time. Even if you were his mother, you're not expected to bring him everywhere. Take some down time.", "Your poor SIL , if I had gone through that and my SIL referred to herself as \"primary mother role\" I would be so devastated.", "NTA. If this wasn't the situation and you randomly brought the baby that would be weird, but they should know what's going on at this point. In the future I guess clarify when you bring him but this is a huge overreaction on their part. It's a lunch. Not some crazy activity...\n\nAlso best of luck for your SIL recovery and kudos to your family for stepping up. That kid is going to be so loved and supported his whole life.", "I disagree,  it\u2019s common courtesy to let people know if you\u2019re bringing a child to an event or ask if it\u2019s ok. They only asked that she lets them know ahead of time if the kid is going to be with her. She can\u2019t just randomly bring the kid to events without letting them know.", "Agreed NTA! If you had a step child, fostered a child, or adopted a child, they had better assume you\u2019re bringing them. This situation isn\u2019t all that much different from those.
