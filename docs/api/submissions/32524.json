He won\u2019t be able to enjoy all the activities and he would probably stay in his room for the whole trip again, and to be honest he could do it at home.

He said he\u2019d be fine at home.\n\n\nHowever, when I brought it up with my brother, he told me that it was an AH move to exclude Carter from the family activities and that we should switch the location of the trip to something that Carter could actually enjoy.

What a clear way to tell him he does not matter to you as much as a bit of skiing. YTA \nYour other son sees it and they both know what kind of emotionally immature father they have and you can bet this is not the first time you hurt and shocked them by your narcissism. If your wife enables this you are terrible parents.", "YTA. \n\n>I told him that the majority of the family would enjoy the ski resort trip and that we gave Carter an option that he was fine with\n\nNo you didn't give him an option. At dinner you announced that you all would go on the trip without him.\n\n>During the dinner I announced that we\u2019re planning to go without him and that he would have the whole house for himself for the whole time we\u2019ll go on the trip.\n\nIt was only when you saw that he was upset that you told him...\n\n>I explained that it\u2019s a family tradition and that he can tag along if he wants, but I don\u2019t want him to spoil the mood with his constant whining\n\nThat is not the same as 'giving him an option'. You purposely excluded him, then you gave him a pity invite that included a warning and clearly indicated you don't want him there.\n\nYou could always create a new tradition and go on a trip elsewhere that all of you would actually be able to enjoy. It's not really maintaining tradition anyway if you intentionally leave out one of your two children. You've already broken tradition there.", "This is egregious.  Your kid has a Long Covid type disability, so he doesn't get to go on family vacations anymore?  You're telling him he's going to \"spoil the mood\"?  And saying he's fine with it, even though he was visibly upset?\n\nListen:  Nobody wants to be chronically ill.  Nobody wants to be excluded and abandoned because they're chronically ill.  You could choose a lovely vacation in a place that accommodated your entire family.  But what you're doing is telling your child that a ski vacation is more important to you than being with him.  Do better!\n\nYTA", "YTA and I'm genuinely heartbroken you even had to ask. It isn't his fault he has long covid aggravated by the cold. Why on earth not use that ski money and start a potentially new tradition that both children could partake in?? It's not a fun \"family\" tradition if you are excluding 25% of that family and leaving them at home, miserable in a lonely house, thinking about how much fun his family is having without him on a trip he used to cherish as much as you do.  \n\n\nFor the love of god please reconsider. This is so damaging.", "YTA\n\n\nWhy don't you plan a vacation everyone can enjoy? How is the ski resort a tradition that is important but the that everyone is involved/family is not important? Wtf.\n\n\n\nAlso- you couldn't have talked to him about. No, you had to announce it, infront of the family, that he is unwelcome. Please feel applauded for being a real ahole here. \"You can tag along if you want to...\" ... yeah... so nice.", "YTA -This is monstrous. Your son is ill, he cannot help that, and what you describe as whining is pain and struggling. So yes, the ski trip probably isn't great for him, but the answer would have been to find something you could ALL do, instead of your answer which is to leave him alone so he doesn't ruin your fun times. And you abuse him verbally to his face to get him to do what you want. Of course he's not coming, he now knows his family don't actually give a damn about him. And don't start with the 'we deserve this, we paid his medical bills.' That's what family are supposed to do when they love each other. You know what family who love each other don't do? Tell one member they are a burden and will ruin the \"mood' because of a medical condition outwith their control and then leave them alone on Christmas so they can ski down a mountain!  Your brother is right, you are selfish, uncaring and cruel.", "YTA he's not \"whining\" he has a health issue he didn't choose to have and now You're basically telling him that you like the resort more than your own kid who probably wants to spend the holidays with his family", "YTA but don\u2019t worry you will have many opportunities to go skiing without your son when he goes NC with you. I do believe you are a troll because no father would be this much of an AH to their child who suffers from a chronic illness. Hopefully when you become ill no one will pit up with your whining and just leave you home on your own. Family traditions/vacations are not about the location, they are about sharing experiences with the people you love. You could have easily included your son by choosing a different vacation but you are obviously too much of a selfish AH to do so.", "Holy shit YTA did you even consider Carter's feelings for half a second?", "YTA - congratulations, you\u2019ve introduced a dynamic of conditional love and considering one of your children a burden!!! He will remember this forever and this will probably be one (of many) huge causes of resentment in your family. This kind of stuff hurts. You couldn\u2019t holiday somewhere else?", "YTA \n\nDo you even like Carter? Because this doesn't sound like a loving parent writing. Did you stop liking him when he got sick? Or was it before?", "YTA\ncongratulations on ruining your relationship with your son because of his MEDICAL CONDITION he has no control over.\nEnjoy your skiing asshole.", "Let\u2019s do a traditional family trip without a member of the family because he can no longer do the activities on the trip comfortably.

Obviously", "YTA. \"He was visibly upset\" but \"we gave Carter an option that he was fine with.\" You don't even believe your own story, do you? \n\nCarter is now differently medically able, and so you're going to just dump him instead of considering him part of the family. WOW. Your brother is correct- you change the \"family\" activity. \n\nHope you enjoy the low-quality nursing home he puts you in... /s", "YTA why not find a new place to visit he can enjoy the activities?", "YTA. I'm a dad of 3 boys. They're men now. How else did you expect Carter to react?  My wife and I would never do that to one of our kids. You're leaving him out of a family tradition. Why not include him and offer to let him stay home. If he still wants to go fine. You can't accommodate your own kid when he obviously has a medical problem? Excluding him without asking is just wrong.", "YTA. Holy hell you are cruel. Can't be a family trip if not all the family is going. \n\nYour disdain for you son and his health comes through heavily in your post. \n\nYou didn't ask, you didn't give him a choice, you just excluded him, you went with rejection over inclusion. There was no option that you gave Carter that he was fine with, he clearly isn't fine with it but probably used to your abhorrent ableist behaviour. \n\nAt least your brother has a heart and cares for family. Maybe they should do a \"family\" trip that's more inclusive and just exclude you for your behaviour.", "YTA\n\nYou are excluding your own child from a family trip because of his disease.\n\n\nYou and your family (expect Carter) are so horrible persons for doing this.", "YTA you blame your kid for being ill? You are going to end up one of those people who doesn\u2019t know why their kids don\u2019t speak to them.", "YTA. 'Hi son, because of an illness out of your control you are no longer a family member. Byeeee!'", "This has to be fake. If not, my god of course YTA. Why not just say you resent your son for being sick and save us all the time?", "YTA, to paraphrase, my kids got a health issues and he\u2019s a buzz kill, I told him so and and that because of this we think his company sucks on holidays and won\u2019t let him come.

Seriously, you only seem to care about how it\u2019s affecting you, and I\u2019m sorry, but my sympathy lies with the young man who had his life ruined by what sounds like Long COVID and has shitty dad only caring because it\u2019s annoying to listen to. \n\nTwo, in general, it\u2019s shitty of you to try and frame this as \u201cWe\u2019re excluding you for you!

His valid complains about being sick annoy you. \n\nThree, it should be obvious that excluding one of your children for the holidays is an asshole move. \n\nFour, one day you are going to be old, needing to be taken care of, and complaining about all of what you\u2019ve got going on, too. I wonder how your son is going to deal with that. \n\nYou\u2019re *way* worse than an asshole of a parent, but I don\u2019t want to get banned, so I\u2019ll leave it at that.", "YTA.

It\u2019s not like he was complaining about having to wake up early. He can still enjoy some things, especially if you help find activities he\u2019s able to do. \n\n\u201cHe can tag along if he wants\u201d so you\u2019re expecting him to pay for it? \n\n\u201cWe gave Carter an option that he was fine with\u201d. No, that option was to stay home. Your lack of empathy as a parent is truly unfathomable. \n\nSincerely, someone with a chronic illness similar to long COVID.", "YTA - Did you try to see if there are additional activities that could be added during the ski trip that wouldn't aggravate his medical issues? Something as simple as a game night with all of the family? Does the trip have to be the exact same every year? Unfair to the others, but none of you see how unfair this is to him? You booted him out of the family in a public announcement instead of sitting down as a family and discussing it and options. The family had no respect for his membership in it, which has been obvious to everyone here. And so what that he complained on the last trip?! Is it possible he complained because the limitations frustrated him? He can't do what he once did with ease. He's young. His body shouldnt fail him this early in life. Or does membership to your family mean a person has to adopt a brainwashed Pollyanna attitude before going downstairs every day for family breakfast? \"No unhappiness allowed, mister!\" The dude has an illness that has compromised his ability to live life healthily...maybe for the remainder of it. That's another 50+ years that he'll potentially have to make adjustments to accommodate himself and others. Fifty plus years of his family telling him he spoils things and they'd rather he just hide away like Quasimodo to alleviate they're discomfort? \"Damn Carter to hell for getting sick! He's just not fun anymore.\" Geez. You're not only an AH but you're dense. Your backpedaling after seeing how he reacted at his dismissal makes this 10x worse. It wasn't even for him. It was to make you seem less of an AH when you knew it was wrong and got caught.", "I would think that picking a new tradition would be nice.", "You're a raging AH for excluding your son because of an illness, and brushing it off as whining, Maybe find a new tradition that all of you can join in on.  \nYTA and so is your wife", "YTA. Damn", "YTA and you\u2019re a bad father/person, and if your wife is okay with this? She sucks too. Your poor kid deserves better parents.", "Definitely YTA.  \nYour kid is disabled and you are penalizing and excluding him because of it.  \nBTW, there are plenty of resorts where you don't actually have to go outside - you can stay in, drink hot chocolate, have a massage, etc.  \n\n\nOr skip the ski resort and choose a different vacation.   \n\n\nOr go with your wife - on a couple's vacation, then take each of your sons on a (cheaper) vacation that is appropriate to their abilities.  \n\n\nAnd even if you gave your son the option - as you said - what sort of thing is that? \"Dear son - we want to go on a vacation you can't enjoy, now - you can say no but we'll probably all resent you and hold it against you\".

You planned something he couldn't do and he was left alone on holiday whilst the rest of you had fun together. He was alone in his room to hide his emotions.\n\nBeing disabled/having a disability isn't fun. The world isn't set up to make life easy for you. Everyday is more difficult. Having a family like yours must surely make it even worse for your son.  I became disabled last year, my family did everything they could to make sure they've booked disabled friendly accommodation, checked the areas for accessibility and what activities/days out we can have altogether. When I suggested something they'd like and I couldn't do, the response was, 'No, this is a family holiday. You're part of this family we're not leaving you alone for the day'\n\nThat is the response of a loving family.

Man when I was growing up, and even now, you\u2019d have to kill me and carry me in a coffin if you want me to bail on my sibling over the holidays. Fuck no.\n\nLast winter my sibling was very sick. So we all gathered round and spent weeks together , just spending time with them.\n\nThis winter, my sibling is firing on all cylinders .. they are the life of the holidays!\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of family if you can\u2019t even show basic love and support", "Imagine describing your kid who was so sick they were in the hospital with enough medical bills to make money tight as \"whiny\" when they're still dealing with symptoms years later. OP you're a bastard and YTA.", "I agree.  Just letting him know so he\u2019s not surprised some day when he\u2019s sitting alone in a nursing home wondering why his wayward kids didn\u2019t do more to include him in their lives and aren\u2019t visiting him in his final years.", "Probably mad about the medical bills as though it\u2019s his fault.", "They said they didn\u2019t think I could afford to take the time off of work.  (A decision they should have let me make when they planned the trip.)  I think it\u2019s because they just didn\u2019t want to incur the extra expense for my airfare and (my dad who is big on appearances) couldn\u2019t let me buy my ticket myself because then he wouldn\u2019t be the big man treating his family to a holiday trip.  \n\nI also have no doubt he told the extended family I didn\u2019t want to come/ was too busy.  Because if he told them it was due to my financial status, that would reveal that he had also cut me off financially and wasn\u2019t helping at all with my college and living expenses.\n\nI think the thing that also was hurtful was they didn\u2019t tell me until last minute, when they were leaving.  Here I am thinking it would be a typical Christmas at home and my parents disappeared when there was no time to purchase a ticket/ be included.  They justified it all by asking my uncle to let me be with them for the holidays.  My uncle and aunt knew how fucked up it was and were great about trying to make me feel welcome, but if I\u2019d had more notice I would have just spent it with friends/ done my own thing.", "That does suck.  My parents were pretty poor and never had much money, but during my high school years I was permitted to stay home for a week alone (my sister had to stay with extended family) because my parents went to\u2026(wait for it!!!)\u2026DISNEY Fucking World!!!!  How the hell do you NEVER take your family on a real vacation and then ditch your school-aged kids to go to Disney!!  Lol.  Karma is a bitch and (blood) families absolutely can suck.

GTFO with that kind of transactional perspective.\n\nFamily holiday? For the whole family.

So simple I go to hot places to holiday. It really does help my breathing.\n\nNot sure why a hot holiday destination wasn\u2019t offered.", "Spoken by someone that doesn\u2019t have breathing issues. Let me tell you I\u2019m lucky I\u2019m only prone to chest infections so as long as I\u2019m careful I\u2019m good. However if I do get one it hurts just to breath and if it\u2019s cold it\u2019s exactly like someone described earlier \u2018razor blades in your chest and lungs\u2019. If they want a family vacation and to enjoy it I bet Carter would soon notice the difference in a hot climate. No it\u2019s easier to just exclude family from a family vacation.", "So, if one of your loved ones became disabled, you'd say, \"tough shit, figure it out, and if we don't see you for the holidays because you're disabled, we're fine with that\"?", "My apologies. I was not trying to paint the child free community as lacking in empathy. Far from it. Most people who choose to be child free are tremendously self-aware AND empathetic. My message is that those incapable of empathy should remain child-free. Indeed, those people should avoid relationships of any kind.", "Poor kid better prepare for a lifetime of therapy", "That\u2019s too bad.", "And if your 18-year-old became disabled, you'd kick them out of the family?", "This! imagine being poor Carter.\n\nLike you finally get to go on your beloved family holiday after being really ill, only you can't enjoy any of it like you used to anymore.\nYou're really sad, so you turn to your parents to try to say how upset you are, thinking they love you enough to show basic empathy.\n\nNext year you're not invited to the skiing trip because your loving parents think you're annoying and would rather you not be there than change their plans.", "\"tag along,\" like he's some outsider, an after thought and guest next to his literal family. wtf is wrong with this person?", "Don't worry. This guy is destined to be posting on an abandoned parents subreddit.", "The fact that OP doesn't see the err of his decision and how he excluded his son and then tells him, \"You have the house\", is beyond mind-blowing.", "Ahh, that's awful. You're right, though. They should have asked you if you wanted to go, left the decision up to you. Asking your uncle and aunt for you to go there makes me think that they had planned it. I'd be fucking fuming!!! I also don't understand how it would be an extra expense for them when you're their child!! Make your own plans for the next Christmas and do what you want to do. Don't include them if you don't want to. Wonder how they'd feel about that. I'm so sorry you had to go through that.", "21 is not a kid.", "Their thought process is \u201cwe want to ski!!!\u201d \ud83d\ude44", "Distancing in the sense of moving out, working, etc, yes they should be doing by 21.

I am NC with my dad for 10 years and have never been happier.  LC with my mom.  They split up and I think she realized in later adulthood that she hadn\u2019t been the parent and has worked to make amends.  I will never treat my kids this way, they will always be welcome for the holidays/ have a safe place to lay their heads regardless of where they are in life.", "Thank god I'm 45 and my mom still considers me a part of the family and still wants to travel and spend time with me. Even though I am disabled.", "Oh honey did mommy and daddy hate you for being a whiney brat and now you want that to happen to others", "I know it's cruel, hence probably good to distance yourself from shitty people. I was replying to someone saying they should go no contact at 18 which they have already passed.", "Oh yes 100% agree. Though to be honest I\u2019m not sure op even likes Carter.", "No, he never used that word. But his child has a chronic medical condition that  causes fatigue and respiratory issues that limit his ability to participate in his normal activities. That's a disability. The fact that OP can't admit it's a disability is part of the problem.", "Same. I was a sick child, so blessed they didn\u2019t just leave me home alone during the yearly family vacation and hope for the best.", "Wow. That's disgusting", "OP's child is disabled, based on OP's description of the limitations of his medical condition. You're saying that it's okay for a family to exclude an adult child from family traditions that they can no longer participate in due to a disability. If my family treated me that way, I'd conclude that I was no longer part of the family.", "Ahh, that's great that you're in a better place now, I'm so happy for you.

You tell yourself that people doing better with their lives have just been luckier than you.\n\nDon't worry you're not alone.", "Twenty bucks says they lit the fire on purpose.", "Pretty much wrong on everything, but good effort."]}
