First thank you for treating them as equals! We often see too many times that doesnt happen. \n\nSecond your SIL and borther should be the ones having a conversation with them on their entitlement and how you were the one being respectful!", "NTA but honey you can't let everything a 12 and 8 year old say affect you this much. \n\nYou made absolutely the right call and you're a great aunt. It was unfortunate that the bracelets were gone but you didn't intend for that to happen. \n\nThey're kids. They're upset. Hopefully their parents will explain to them that you were doing the right thing and trying to look out for all of them, as well as make sure they didn't get in trouble with them for having those bracelets. And they'll get over it.", "NTA \n\nThey'll get over it. You were being cautious. Eventually they'll forget those bracelets even existed.  It would be nice if their mom stepped in and explained to them that what you did was the right thing to do and that they're being brats for shunning you.", "Jesus, NTA\n\nYou are 100% right.  You aren't the mom and you don't want to buy things she might disapprove of.  Let them sulk.  See how they behave when you send your nephew a nice gift on his birthday.", "NTA\n\nAlways defer to the parents and let them be the bad guys.", "NTA I do the same with my sisters kids. Unfortunately, in this situation, you were kind of damned if you do damned if you don\u2019t. If you bought it and your sister-in-law didn\u2019t like it, you wouldn\u2019t hear the end of it but you didn\u2019t and now the girls are mad at you. One day when they\u2019re older, they will understand.", "NTA! \n\nUnfortunately, it happened, but you made the right decision by asking your SIL for permission before buying them. Your nieces are young kids, and they might not understand your reason, but I think your SIL need to talk to them about that.", "NTA - you seem like a lovely aunt. They're in tough ages where they get attitude streaks but you did the right thing. Don't take it too hard or hold it against yourself or them. They'll warm back up.", "NTA \nYou did everything right and it's unfortunate that your nieces are upset with you. You should speak to their parents and let them have a conversion with your nieces. It's much safer and better to err on the side of seeking permission before getting them things than to end up in a medical emergency because you wanted to please your nieces", "NTA,\n\nYou were being respectful and responsible.\n\nThey're just kids, won't get it just now but will in the future.\n\nDon't worry about it, will be yesterday's news when some kid at school acts like a jerk with them.\n\nJust give them time and they'll forget all about it. You did not a thing wrong!", "Nta. I guess your nieces are going to learn that their extremely narcissistic response is okay or not by the way everyone responds. They need help regulating their emotions and learning how to be empathetic and what healthy communication looks like. Normal for them to be disappointed but not okay to take it further and go on this long- this is really a parenting issue and not yours to be involved in. Not your job. \nIf you are cut out just by them, be polite and sweet but don\u2019t focus on them next time you happen to be around, but don\u2019t buy them anything, ever, beyond a card. If they sincerely apologize accept it but explain that going forward you probably won\u2019t be buying them anything because you don\u2019t want to go through that again. See how they respond with just a card or very small gift before engaging in this set up again. Not punishing, just natural consequences for their choices. Be the same as always with your nephew. \nNot your monkeys, not your zoo.", "NTA. They\u2019ll get over it. It\u2019s always best policy to check with parents first.", "NTA\n\nKids need to learn you don't always get what you want and you were right to ask mom\nSafety trumps their wants", "NTA\n\nThese girls need a serious talking to. You weren't mean to them. You were being very respectful to their parents wishes. Their mom should definitely step up and handle this situation.", "NAH", "NTA. You wanting to check first was a very reasonable thing to do. Their comment to you that you need to be an adult was waaaay out of line. Kids will be kids, but just because they\u2019re continuing their tantrum doesn\u2019t mean you were wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou made the right call by asking your SIL first.

No offense, but your nieces sound like little brats", "nta just children being childish, they will move on eventually", "NTA I think your brother and sil appreciate that you respect them and don\u2019t over step boundaries. I think they need to teach the girls that they can\u2019t have everything they want.", "NTA but those kids have entitlement issues", "NTA. You did your due diligence and wanted to be sure they'd be safe. Which is what adults who love children do. If they are mad about that, they're brats.

How could you not have anticipated them wanting things? Did you tell your SIL that you were taking them there?\n \"Hey, SIL, I'm going to take the girls to a flea market. They have stuff like jewelery,  purses, trinkets. Can I buy them each something? Are there any types of items that they can't have?\"\n\n\nTaking them to a flea market with the possibility of not being allowed to buy them something, and not setting that as a clear expectation, is kinda an AH move.
