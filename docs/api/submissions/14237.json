Classic rich parents attitude. He was going to ditch you to fly business. He unnecessarily waited to book. Now he wants things to go his way cause he messed up. Yeah, I think I figured out who is the AH.", "NTA, he should have considered things at the time when you told him you and your other 2 friends were booking tickets.", "NTA\nIts a seat on a plane for crying out loud. You told him when you were booking. He didn\u2019t want to book the same time and that\u2019s just naturally what happens when you don\u2019t book together. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect others to change what they already booked because you wanted to wait.", "NTA. This was *his* choice.", "NTA. If Steve wanted to sit with you guys he should\u2019ve booked his ticket earlier, especially if he had the money. And as you said, he was happy to sit alone when he was going to book a business class ticket. I recommend patching things up before the trip though, so it\u2019s not awkward.", "NTA.\n\n\\>I feel kind\u2019ve bad about leaving him alone\n\nYou didn't leave him alone.  You gave him the freedom to make his choices, and he made them.  He decided he wanted to better-deal you by going business class.  He decided he was fine with being alone, provided he could get more than you could afford.  When that didn't work, he wanted you to take less so that he could have what you rightfully paid for.  He is entitled.  This will prevent him from being a good friend in the future too, because he is putting himself first, and expecting you to take the scraps.  This behavior will come out in other ways too.  Expect it, and don't feel bad about not playing into it.", "NTA - he chose not to book when you two were. Its on him.", "NTA\n\nThis one pretty open and shut. You communicated everything to him. You informed him with everything he needed to know in order to be with y\u2019all. He made decisions based on the information. He did not like the outcome of his own decisions. That\u2019s on him. Not everybody has the resources to cover for his mistakes.", "NTA. The flight is such a small part of the trip and sitting together is overrated anyway.", "Nta he is in the find out portion of F around and Find out.", "\nNTA   you booked early to pick your seat. \nToo bad for him", "NTA\n\nI would tell Steve, hey why don't you upgrade us all to business class and then we can sit together.
