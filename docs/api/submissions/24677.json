{"id": 24677, "submission_id": "15rdz5t", "title": "AITA for starting to plan vacations without my wife?", "selftext": "I (m50) have been married to a wonderful woman for 30 years now.  We met when I was stationed in Germany in the Army.  We moved back here to the states after I got out of the Army.  I make a decent living not extravagant, but enough to pay the bills.  She for the most part has been a stay at home mom with some side jobs here and there, but nothing long term maybe four years of working all together.  \n\nThe problem is my wife and I completely disagree on what a vacation is.  My idea of a vacation is going somewhere and doing something, rent a cabin at a lake, go to a beach somewhere and get drunk from morning till midnight.  My wife hates all of that.  Her idea of a vacation is to go to some city she has never been before and walk around ohhhhing and ahhhing at the buildings, or go to a museum.  That is my definition of torturing me for the nuclear launch codes.\n\nThis has been an issue our entire marriage.  We can never agree on a vacation, so we just end up spending most of our vacation budget on sending her back to Germany every other year to visit family and friends (when she goes back it's for a month or two).  On the years that she doesn't go to Germany she usually does some girl trip with some of her friends; Las Vegas, Nashville, Gettysburg (her family from Germany came over and wanted to go), New York, etc.\n\n  In our 30 year marriage I've been on two vacations. one was in 1998 to a lake cabin that my parents paid for and invited us to go with them.  Once in 2019 for our 25th anniversary, we rented a motorcycle in Miami and went to Key West and Naples Florida.  Now that trip to Miami was what I thought a start to something we both enjoyed.  \n\nI bought a cheap used motorcycle and we started riding all over our home state.  Then when I came in to a little bit of unexpected money I upgraded to a bigger touring bike thinking that we could use it for vacations.  Well right after I got the new bike my wife had an unrelated injury and couldn't ride for awhile.  No biggie, right?  Well now I can't get her back on the bike.  I know I can't force her, but I spent a LOT of money on this bike because I thought it was an investment in something we both enjoyed doing together.  I'm not going to let the investment go to waste and so I'm planning a 2,500 mile road trip on the bike here in a few weeks for my vacation.  My wife doesn't like the fact that I planned a vacation without including her.  To be fair I asked her to go, she said \"no\".  I guess she thought that meant I wasn't going to go either.  We had a big argument and basically I just put my foot down and said \"I get to have a vacation that I want also\".  She already had another Vegas trip planned for later this year and is planning on going back to Germany for X-mas and New Years.  I honestly don't know why she is so upset about me taking a week for myself.  Am I missing something?\n\nEdit** Didn't realize that I left out the part where I may be TA.  I am using most of the budget for her Vegas trip that she was planning.  She can still go, but it may mean she will have to use the money from her trip to Germany and so she would probably have to cut the trip to Germany shorter than she would like.", "created_utc": 1692063325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rdz5t/aita_for_starting_to_plan_vacations_without_my/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She gets a vacation and you get a vacation. It sounds like she's been getting her preferred vacation for years without you taking a similar opportunity, so fair is fair.", "NAH. Sounds like you two need to sit down and have a conversation about budgets and establish money each person can have for vacations, with an eye towards equity in your different styles.  Some advice: also tie that to some repairs in your relationship regarding the hurt feelings this fight clearly has done, and calmly express your viewpoint about what you want to be different in your ideal vacation without shitting on her idea of one.", "Uhmmmm\u2026 getting drunk from morning til midnight and also wanting to ride around on a motorcycle??? \n\nYTA just for that", "INFO\n\nIs there a reason you can't go to Germany for 2 weeks, and do half a week in a city, a week getting drunk in an alpine chalet, and half a week in another city?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr for that matter, get a chalet in Bavaria and let your wife day trip it to Munich or Fussen or Neuschwanstein?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously, the beauty of the alps (besides the literal beauty) is you can be in a mountainside hut and still less than an hour from a town or city.", "NAH. I don\u2019t think you are being unreasonable for wanting a vacation, and I do think your wife got comfortable with her two yearly trips. But I also think that your change in heart is a bit late in the year, and should have been more of a discussion than you arbitrarily changing possibly set plans.\n\nI think you should just have a conversation with your wife and explain the situation.\n\nHowever, a suggestion: set a separate fund for your wife\u2019s trips back to Germany to see her family, and two separate funds that are equally financed for each of you to take a vacation. The intervals and length will be completely dependent on what type of trip each of you schedules. I suggest a separate fund for her trips to Germany as a few other commenters indicate it may not really be a vacation and with that long of a flight and flight costs, spending more time less frequently may actually be more financially logical.", "Info:  did you actually bother to ASK your wife before you spent the money to upgrade to a 'bigger touring bike' or did you just assume she wanted to go on another bike vacation with you on it?

You're married, this should've been discussed first.", "Wait wait wait. She is using YOUR money to fund her vacations that she has sometimes twice a year but you have only gone on 2?? Absolutely not. NTA, it\u2019s a shame that she can\u2019t use all YOUR money in Vegas, you are entitled to a trip on your hard earned dime, and if she\u2019s complaining about not having enough money for her trip, she\u2019s more than welcome to get a job and pay for herself.

Seems like what you're doing is completely reasonably, though obviously it would be best if you could get your wife on board.", "NTA   It seems as though you've bent over backwards for years, time after time, to fund her expensive international travel.  The least she could do is to reciprocate one time.  Nothing wrong with separate vacations given the wildly divergent goals between you two, but you certainly deserve one.", "YTA\n\nYou're renting a cabin and getting drunk?\n\nA cabin doesn't have the services of a hotel and restaurants.\n\nSo who is doing the cooking, making the beds, keeping things tidy, while you're drunk?  \n\n(And who is doing all these things when you two are at home?) \n\nBeing your hotel staff isn't a vacation for your wife, and vacation money should not be put towards trips that put her in that role.  \n\nAnd a motorcycle trip, after she's been injured?  Even if she's cleared to ride, she's going to be far from at her best, strength-wise.  Short, easy rides, not a multi-day trek, are the place to start.  She may never be at the point where such a long trip is comfortable and enjoyable again, age catches up with us all.\n\nFamily vacations need to be planned that gives everyone a break.  First you're choosing cabins where you plan to be drunk, which would leave the housekeeping to her, and next you choose a trip that's an obvious bad idea for someone in their 50s coming back from an injury.  \n\nMaybe do a cruise together, or the like, where you can relax and drink, and she can explore during shore excursions, go to shows, etc.  And neither of you are stuck with the housekeeping.", ">I guess she thought that meant I wasn't going to go either. \n\n>I am using most of the budget for her Vegas trip that she was planning\n\nYTA. I'd hazard your wife is upset because you pulled the rug out from underneath her.\n\nIt's ok to want your own trip, the way she has hers. It's ok to not want the same things from a holiday. But you organised a biking holiday you knew she wouldn't come on because of her injury, with you shared budget, and you just assumed it was fine? \n\nYou need to communicate and make decisions together, even if the end result is you going off on holiday alone.", "We lived overseas for many years and pretty quickly learned to differentiate between \"vacations\" and \"trips.\"  Vacations were what you described - relaxing/no pressure/everybody chill.  Trips were sight-seeing adventures - and that seems to be what your wife likes.  \n\nWith \"Vacations\", we always made sure there was something for everyone - good food/wine (hubby), spa (me), on-site activities (kids).  \"Trips\" were to fun/exotic destinations - but we didn't want to over-do it, so in terms of sights/activities - we had a \"must-see\" list, a \"would be nice\" list, and an \"if there is time\" list.  It worked out well for us.\n\nAs for separate vacations due to separate interests - I'm all for it.  My husband has certain activities he likes and he does that with his buddies.  I have my fun activities....and I do that with my friends. \n\nBut....a HARD NO to you using her Vegas money for your trip!

I think your idea of a vacation is most men's idea of a vacation. Rent a beach house or cabin, day drink, grill out, etc... well *most* women aren't into this. They're into the touristy ooh ahh take a picture at this monument sort of vacation. \n\nMost people on reddit hate this phrase, but happy wife happy life. I say this because as men we require little to be happy and we tolerate lots of discomfort. A good chunk of women don't tolerate much discomfort and require substantially more to be happy. \n\nWith that said, you **should** bite the bullet every once in a while battle. I hate waking up early on my own vacation to go see some statue I don't give a shit about, but hey suck it up. Smile for the pictures. Don't have an attitude. Part of being a husband and father is spending *at least* 65%+ of your time doing shit you don't want to do without complaining. You only gotta do it like once a year bud. \n\nIf you did this once a year or at least more than twice in 30 years, you would have a leg to stand on. You could go on your guy trips or solo trips. But look at the optics of your situation. On her end it doesn't look good. It's a \"we do what I want or I go alone\". I get where you're coming from, I think you deserve your vacation, but not in this way bud. You should have framed this differently. It's all about optics. \n\nAlso, please be careful bud. 5 years in the Army. I have lost almost as many friends to motorcycle accidents as suicide since getting out.

She does not get to complain if she doesn't get to spend the full budget on just her vacations going forward. Nor does she get to complain about you enjoying your style of vacation without her.\n\nI hope you enjoy your trip. You may want to discuss with wife how the vacation fund is now going to be split between the two of you. (You may also want to highlight for her how much money she has got to spend on her vacations over the years compared to you.) If she can agree to something that you also agree to, you both equally support that and spend the remainder of your share doing what you want. If there is not appealing shared vacation, then she needs to accept that you are going to enjoy the same vacation perks she has been enjoying for years.", "Let me get this right she gets to go where she wants.

I'm not sure why you two are still together if neither will compromise on holiday destinations in order to spend quality time together.\n\nI would note that the trips back to Germany may involve looking after elderly relatives, so may be as much duty as anything else.

You're married and need to discuss things. If the money was budgeted for her trips it's absolutely wrong of you to decide that your trip takes precedent over those already budgeted.\n\nYour idea of a vacation is getting drunk every night, which is a shitty vacation for anyone who doesn't want to get drunk every night.\n\nThere were a lot of ways to deal with finances and vacations, most of which involve communication which you can't bother with.\n\nYears ago you should've talked to her about consistently working pt once your kids were in school. Now that you're TA you need to wait until she returns from Germany and is no longer jet lagged to talk to her about getting a pt job, doing project work or what have you to finance her extended visits and girls trips. \n\nYou've also had the option of seeking higher paying work yourself and haven't. \n\nIt's normal for people who left their home country for a partner to take extended visits. Seeing her family regularly is part of what she gave up for you and you need to support her keeping that connection. \n\nAs far as the very expensive motorcycle is concerned it sounds like you bought it without conversation with your wife; you say you came into money which sounds like inheritance, work bonus or gambling.

Where were the kids - presumably they went with her, so you got to live the \u201cyoung, free, single, childless\u201d life for 6-8 weeks every summer.\n\nDid you never invite friends over & take a week off, and have your (allegedly) ideal holiday week of drinking while they were away?\n\nCould you not have invited yourself to stay at a friends house while the family was away, and had a holiday that way, if budget was tight?\n\nAnd if there\u2019s such an easy fix to \u201cyou just spent her Las Vegas holiday money\u201d of \u201cshe just cuts her German trip short\u201d - then why haven\u2019t you been doing that all along?

There\u2019s a huge amount of holiday locations where you can base yourself in the country, but have day trips to a local city for museums etc. Or you could plan a two-locations holiday - stop in a city for 2 nights on the way, then onto the country retreat for the rest of the week. \n\nYou haven\u2019t tried, for 30 years, and now you\u2019re being dramatic & going back on a previous agreement.

And, OP, you should have an annual vacation budget. Split it in half between you or negotiate it to some other agreeable split, but make sure you are getting some fun time. Heck, you may want to negotiate the split year by year depending on what each of you wants to do. \n\nAnd do try to have a vacation for the both of you from time to time.

Barcelona is one that comes to mind (tons of museums and beautiful beaches a train ride away). St. Petersburg, FL is another (Dali Museum and amazing beaches). South of France (more art and beaches). Athens, Greece (history, art, nightlife, beaches, island hopping).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also encourage you to at least GO to Europe with her. It's a lot easier and cheaper to hop around and split your time doing different things there. Go to Italy. Spend a week in Rome or Venice together and then split and you can go on a road trip to the coast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont think each of your needs are mutually exclusive. You just haven't figured out how to actually mesh them and I dont think you fully understand what each other actually wants. Like you tried and got shut down and were like this is impossible. I think you guys just need to have better brainstorming sessions. I am drawn to both of your meanings of travel. I want my trip to have meaning, adventure, beauty, and to experience something I couldn't do somewhere else, to understand the place I am, and usually to be near/in water or nature, but also in a city. You *can* have it all but you have to be better planners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt might actually work in your favor to travel in a larger group too. That way your wife can hang doing cultural things with a friend while you stay chilling on the beach with some beers with your friend and then meet up to do excursions if you'd like or have dinner etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: spaces", "That's unfortunate, because it sounds like a great compromise. You are NTA.", "I'm not sure what you disagree with me on, I said he deserves a vacation. \n\nMy point is that communication is key and this is something that should've been discussed.", "I just find it awful that you have been together 30 years and she won\u2019t compromise, it could easily be a tag team of \u201cthis year we\u2019ll do your vacation, next year we do mine\u201d. Her selfishness really shows and I feel so bad for you.", "Housekeeping vs cooking is no comparison. Housekeeping is much more work.", "Take the money from her Vagas trip, she has already been there! It's your turn to enjoy a vacation so ha fun and enjoy.", "Because trips to visit family don't count as vacations in my life. And Germany or not, that's what her second trip is.", "My bad. I misread the \"most of the budget\" into \"most of her budget\". In this case NTA definitely.", "How does this not count as discussing it?\n\nHe asked her to go. She said no. He said 'okay well I'm still going on my trip which means you will have to cut not this one but the next one of yours short.' She said no. He said no back. \n\nI mean neither are compromising so I don't understand why she just \"wins\" this argument and gets to do what she wants, which is what she's been doing for 30 years?", "I think that depends on whether they had discussed and agreed to her going to Vegas then Germany.

And he should have put that in his original post.", "Well I mean I'm simplifying but it's clear they tried talking about it, it ended up in a big argument where \"he put his foot down\" per the post.\n\nWhich is quite frankly understandable after *30 years* and she's not willing compromise by cutting short one vacation she gets *every year* to give him a week off doing what he wants to do.\n\nI really can't imagine being this insanely selfish. She's so very clearly in the wrong that if the \"discussion\" however short didn't end in her realizing she needs to compromise on this, well that's on her.", "I think it's just weird to assume that about someone you don't know of. It's either she's this knowingly malicious person or maybe, like most marriage issues, this is something that could be talked out like adults but hasn't yet."]}
