They need to grow up and act like adults, yes it's hard for someone to be pregnant, but the whole household doesn't go into food or clothing lock down to appease her. You are NTA and allowing this to continue will let her set more ridiculous rules to control you all. It's trash.", "NTA...

Sure I asked the windows be opened when they were made, we avoid restaurants that sell those items due to smell and specifically no talking about pork (even pork related words made me sick which was weird), but banning it like that is going too far.

If your dad wishes to go on a restrictive diet, he can do so.  You and your siblings don\u2019t have to.

Did I not allow my ex husband to eat said pizza? No.  He ate it. I ordered different pizza for myself or ate something else. Pregnancy is wild.  You are a child and NTA, but your dad is.

Pregnancy can be rough like that.\n\nBut you shouldn't be so restricted outside the house. It's not your baby. You weren't involved with getting her pregnant. You weren't consulted (I assume). Your dad is being a donkey about this one.", "No.  Can I \"understand\" not eating these foods in front of her but not being able to eat them outside??  Her father is mad if he thinks this makes the least bit of sense.  How big is your stepmother's range of smell to know what you eat or don't eat when you're out of the house.  This \"we have to go through this together with her\" thing is not applicable in this situation, it seems to me that her stepmother has become a nuisance because of her father's pampering.  I understand from the heart that being pregnant must be difficult, complicated and even painful, but that doesn't give you the power to define other people's food even more when they're not even at home. Sorry for any grammar mistakes. English is not my mother tongue.", "NTA, at all. Your dad is being ridiculous. From your comments, your stepmom hasn't even asked for you all to do this; your dad is taking an idea and stretching it into ludicrous. You eating food that your stepmom will never even *see* does not affect her in the slightest, and it is how you'll get through another half year without losing it or resenting them for these restrictions. \n\nHe needs to get over this and start respecting your agency and your time. Telling you what you can and cannot eat to this extent is NOT healthy -- and quite frankly if he keeps this up, he's bound to lose what he's taking for granted: a kid who is honest about where they're going and what they're doing.

I also am not one of those women who's morning sickness fades as soon as I get further into my pregnancy. I puke the whole pregnancy with both of my viable pregnancies. You figure out how to push through with finding something to smell or eat to help head off nausea the best you can. There is an alcohol swab hack that works really well, I have set hand sanitizers that help or lotion scents to help me. \n\nHeck we have a special whiskey he only drinks when he passes a final exam for his master's degree and I waddled my giant butt down to the basement to pour him his glass when he texted me his results.

However, I would never in a million years till my family they couldn't enjoy those things. My first pregnancy, I couldn't stand Domino's Pizza. Literally, the smell of it would have me running to the bathroom. Sell my compromise and my husband when he wanted it was that he could order it when he knew I wasn't going to be around as long as it was gone before I got home.\n\nIf she's losing her s*** at just the idea of you eating something she can't that's not pregnancy hormones that's an entitled little brat.", "NTA. Pregnancy doesn't make someone a controlling bad person. I had severe morning sickness for 7 months out of 9. And I never tried to control who ate what or where they could go. It's highly inappropriate and controlling. Your dad is an idiot to fall for it. It's not your role to cater to two irrational adults' delusions. Good for you to stand up for yourself. But just get ready because if Anna is this controlling while pregnant it's gonna be hell when she will have a kid. I'm feeling sorry for you already.

I had hg, basically morning (all day) sickness all the way through and couldn\u2019t keep down anything but tomato soup and porridge (not even plain water, it was weird). \n\nMy husband ate whatever he wanted.

It only lasted properly for about 2 hours before I was fine but couldn\u2019t eat much if I wanted to stay that way, but that Sunday dinner was food of the gods!\n\nMy husband certainly kept in mind I couldn\u2019t have stuff and smell triggered the vomiting most days, but I never asked him not to eat stuff, it was probably easier that on a bad day I couldn\u2019t roll over in bed, nevermind get up (sick bucket\u2026 yay!) so I wasn\u2019t eating with/near him anyway!", "Jesus fuck. I've been pregnant and I've wanted things I couldn't eat and got really jealous over the fact my balloon of a belly made it so everyone else looked amazing and I just looked like a sphere but that is no excuse at all for this woman's entitlement and control. And your invertebrate of a father enabling her is creating a rod for not only his back but yours. Kick off more. Why should you take this? If it makes her ill, that's reasonable to not allow certain things, but this is just selfish on her part. Don't talk to me about pregnancy hormones - I had plenty of those in my system, but that gives no one the right to control like this.\n\nShame on her, huge shame on your dad and NTA.", "Nta\n\nYour dad is favoring his wife.

If what you say is true hopefully her response will be to direct those pregnancy hormones straight at your dad and rip him a new one.", "This is not about smell. It's about control. She wasn't allowed to leave the house to meet friends because she needs to be mindful of her stepmother. She cannot eat those food outside of the house. She can't meet up with friends because of this issue. It's not morning sickness. It's control.", "Also if she\u2019s amenable, plan to go out somewhere post birth with her, so she can have the food she actually wants.

Anna, apparently, cannot eat quite a number of things she previously enjoyed because they now make her sick \u2013 she didn't stop eating beef, pork, fish, and all desserts/sweet things just for funsies \u2013 but she is also trying to exert way too much control over her husband and step-daughter, and her husband is supporting and assisting her in it.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: Apparently, Anna *isn't* trying to control them; it's all OP's father.
