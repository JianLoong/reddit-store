This is completely unreasonable. I can get not having those specific food in the house (even that is extreme) but to deny food to you in \"solidarity\" - some on...  When the kid is born will you be woken up at night in solidarity as well", "NTA, this is absolutely unreasonable and so immature of them! They need to grow up and act like adults, yes it's hard for someone to be pregnant, but the whole household doesn't go into food or clothing lock down to appease her. You are NTA and allowing this to continue will let her set more ridiculous rules to control you all. It's trash.", "NTA... That is a completely unreasonable request and you are being more than accommodating to your step mom. She is the one that needs to grow up and your dad should stop enabling her.", "Pregnant lady here. NTA! Yes hormones are definitely a vicious thing, your patience is definitely next to zero. However, restricting everyone else's diets is very unfair.\n\nYour dad is projecting your step mom's issues onto everyone else and it's making it stressful for everyone. Hang in there.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been pregnant, and at one point Mexican food was just about the only thing I *could* eat. I get it. Pregnancy is hard. But your dad and stepmom are being ridiculous.\n\nReasonable: please don\u2019t eat foods near your stepmom that make her gag. Unreasonable: you aren\u2019t allowed to eat those foods at all. Even outside the house.\n\nAlso: pregnancy hormones aren\u2019t fun, but they also aren\u2019t a license to be a self-centered, unreasonable AH to other people.", "NTA.  Immature?!?  You are FIFTEEN.  Yes - you ARE immature and you are meant to be but your behaviour here is NOT immature.  That whole 'don't eat it out of solidarity' is BS.  Sure, maybe for HIM it would be nice to show solidarity and likewise not eat it too - but that does NOT extend to you - nothing about that pregnancy is your doing.  Your father is very much the AH here.", "NTA. She\u2019s the one who can\u2019t have that stuff", "NTA- but your dad is absolutely being one. Everyone else shouldnt have to stop living, restrict their diet, and suffer because your stepmom is pregnant. I had horrific sickness during my pregnancies, but I didn\u2019t expect everyone to stop eating because I couldn\u2019t.", "NTA. This may sound a bit crude, but it tags two to tango, not three. Why should you have to restrict your diet for her. I get not eating it around her because it makes her sick, but you shouldn't have to cut it out entirely.", "NTA maybe he should give it up with her out of solidarity b/c that\u2019s his partner but you should be able to eat whatever you fucking want especially when she\u2019s not around to get sick. \n\nNow screaming isn\u2019t the best reaction but you\u2019re sad is being ridiculous and you shouldn\u2019t have to put up with that I would have totally gone off too", "NTA.\nYeah you probably shouldnt scream at your Dad and you should apologize for the outburst. However it is not fair to post restrictions on people's diet for them. Food in the house is understandable because of the food scents, but outside the house when your stepmother isn't even there is too much.", "It\u2019s like your dad is trying really hard for you to dislike Anna and that\u2019s even worse, what he\u2019s doing is gonna hurt your relationship with her and at the end of the 9 months it will be hard to put everything back together, calmly talk to him and tell him this, because it\u2019s not your responsibility to keep the same diet as someone else for whatever reason, try to be empathetic to her because she\u2019s clearly going through a tough time but don\u2019t keep wearing off because of it", "You are not TA!! Pregnancies can be very rough but your dad is coddling Anna. It\u2019s a bit ridiculous to not allow everyone else to enjoy their lives away from the house just because Anna will feel left out. He is putting her above everyone else and all the breeds is resentment. \n   You are already supporting Anna by not doing everything in front of her. He is just mad because you are bringing to light what he is doing wrong and you aren\u2019t just rolling over now. Super sad on your dad\u2019s part. Good luck sweetheart and don\u2019t be too hard on yourself.", " Not even Rachel Green herself dare tell the gang they couldn't have a turkey for Thanksgiving during her aversion to poultry!! NTA", "NTA. Your dad got Your stepmom pregnant. You had nothing to do with it. What benefit are you getting from the situation other than giving up your food to put up with her likes and dislikes? So many pregnant ladies in this world got by without imposing their likes and dislikes on the kids in the family. Your dad is the AH for pandering to his new wife and making you suffer in doing so.", "Oh god.. I really was gonna say YTA until that fourth paragraph. Not even being able to GO OUT because someone else is pregnant? I would\u2019ve been upset too. \n\nThat said, pregnancy sucks big ol donkey leg. I definitely got upset over some really small stuff. As the months passed, it was harder and harder to focus on anything except for my stomach ripping and trying to keep my health. \n\nYour dad is taking the easy way out by making everyone else in the house responsible for his wife\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s very easy for him to go in there and rub her feet and say \u201chey, (OP) is gonna go out with a friend.
