It would\u2019ve made so much more sense to ask her before she left, or wait until she got back, than to choose the tiny window of time she was out of the way to go rifling through her kitchen.\n\nSpeaking of which: opening cabinets made sense, but who keeps glasses in drawers?

She doesn\u2019t know you that well, and dating is about getting to know someone, not \u201cletting boundaries down\u201d.

You could have asked for water either before or after she went to the restroom.

Maybe it was a simple misunderstanding, but where you fucked up was in not apologizing.\n\nNo, you didn't apologize: You said you were sorry \"she got upset,\" you didn't apologize for your actions. Minor mistake made far worse by your response to it.\n\nThis early in a relationship, probably a deal breaker unless you apologize much more convincingly, IMMEDIATELY, and convince her you understand what you're apologizing for, because now you have two things to apologize for:\n\n1) The misunderstanding about the glassware.

Enough trust to leave you alone to go to the loo.  But not enough trust to have you help yourself to water?  \n\nThe lack of offer of refreshments is kinda rude, but also adds an informality to the date.... a lack of politeness on her part, leading to a guest in her home uncertain how to handle her private space and feeling uncomfortable through hunger or thirst.  You're not a kid that you should feel you need to ask for something so basic.\n\nSo your date contributed to this situation.  I also believe your explanation as to how the situation arose.  I don't think kitchen cupboards are private, but kitchen drawers are more private than cupboards... not the ones that clearly hold pots tho.  I think she was overly defensive and territorial, given she contributed to the necessity of you needing a drink.  So far...Not an AH.\n\n(What I would've done as host and guest is irrelevant.... for reference I would've shown a guest around so they knew where the bathroom was and so they could get to know me better, and I would've made food and drink readily available.   As a guest I would've gone looking for water, and if unable to find a glass without touching anything, I would've scurried back to my seat and waited until they were out of the bathroom.)\n\nBut.... you went badly wrong after that.

You can't just tell someone in their own home they are wrong for how they wish their home and themselves to be treated!  Their wishes may not align with your values, and that's a learning moment,  but they are never wrong in the scenario you describe!   Ever. \n\nAnd you show your own morals here to be unfortunately lacking.   If you've offended anyone, whether inadvertent or not, you don't believe you should simply apologise for hurting them.  You believe defending yourself and attacking them is correct.   Saying you're sorry they are angry with you is passive-aggressive, underhanded bullshit.   I'm disappointed you're such a person,  and hope that you can consider if this is the person you want to be to anyone in your future... let alone a potential partner.

The reason why it's kind of okay to open cabinets in this scenario is because there's other people around, and with people helping themselves already there's an acceptable level of chaos.\n\nIt's different when you're at the apartment of the woman you're dating, hanging out with just her, and you're in the kitchen alone while she's in the bathroom, completely unaware you've even left the couch. When it's your first time in her home, you should act like a guest and *ask* for water. Eventually, if you date long enough that is, you get comfortable enough and you know where the glasses are, you can start getting your own water. But definitely not on the first visit. You can tell us until you're blue in the face you \"only\" wanted water, but you need to understand how this looked to her: a guy she's only known for a few weeks was rooting through her stuff.

But I would encourage you to stop seeing this as a water issue, and instead see 3 underlying things:\n\n\n1.  Canceled consent:  I bet that as the householder, hosting a first visit, her antenna were pretty attuned to minding her space.  When you opened the cupboards without first asking, it removed her ability to express consent to an opening of something in your direction.  This probably felt heightened too, because it appears this was going to be the night on which she wanted to consent to sex with you.\n\n\n2.  Lack of empathy/awareness of her feelings:  When she pointed out the crossed boundary to you, like 97% of guys you went to facts and litigated her facts.  What didn't happen, was you didn't acknowledge her feelings.  It's not a concession or surrender to acknowledge another's feelings.  Just say, \"Hey, wow, I hear you about having a boundary, getting those crossed feels violating.   Thank you for looking out for yourself.\"  \n\n3.  Attempted day-after apology text which repeated the wrongs:  Here, do you see how your text referred to \"getting water?\"  To her ear, you are litigating the facts again.  She doesn't see it as recognizing her feelings.  I know you said the word sorry, but the term has no value to her because you are litigating, not empathizing.\n\nSee if you can view the occurrence through this lens.

Then you started exhibiting behaviors that violated her boundaries at that level and when she got upset you called her illogical.\n\n\"She cut the date short and said she wanted time to think. I texted her later that night\"\n\nWhen she had JUST SAID she needed time??\n\n...\"I was sorry that she got mad at me\" \n\nSure, because why develop social skills at this point?\n\n\"She hasn't messaged me back\" \n\nWhy would she? You overstepped her boundaries, insulted her as a \"knee jerk reaction\", and then instead of respecting her request for time to think you sent her an obnoxious non-apology", "My *own mother* was recently a guest in my new home for the first time and she asked me for a glass of water rather than assuming she could rifle through my cabinets. \nAnd I won\u2019t even address the \u2018I\u2019m sorry you were mad\u2019 non-apology. YTA, OP\n\nEdit: added missing word", "Yes! I hate when people attempt to apologize by saying I\u2019m sorry you got upset.", "My cups are in drawers to.  But I wouldn't want someone digging threw my drawers, especially first time there and wait until I leave.  Then not apologize...bye bye", "She\u2019s obviously not upset about the water. It probably was a medication drawer, documents or something like that. Also opening drawers for cups? Lol. \n\nand I agree 100% with this apologizing advice. You messed up. We all do. Time to responsibility.", "Exactly. She would be gone long if she was just in the bathroom. He waited until the second she left the room, then darted into the kitchen to get in as much snooping as possible before she got back.", "I have disposable cups in a drawer, so I guess I could see it happening. It's not a silverwear drawer, its more of a full-ass dresser drawer. Random picture stolen from Amazon for reference - https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81078zegCIL.\\_AC\\_SX522\\_.jpg", "It's the fact his apology was I'm sorry you got angry at my action", "You're not automatically wrong, but I've been in a lot of kitchens where they were stored in drawers and where I had a hard time finding them. The \"looking through the kitchen\" part of the post is not weird to me at all, I was going for NTA but then his statements of \"you should be letting your guard down\" and stuff made me rethink.", "Neither me nor my friends are like that... It's always been obvious that of course you can grab what you need from the kitchen without asking. They're a guest, not a prisoner.\n\nMaybe it's a US thing though to have to ask. I'm in Australia.", "Mine are in an \"illogical\" spot- in a cabinet to the left of the oven, as far away from the dishwasher and sink as possible.  It works better for me because of the way the cabinets in my kitchen are sized.\n\nEven so, everytime someone new tries to find my cups or mugs, it takes them less than a minute.  Unless she has an insanely massive kitchen, I don't see how OP needed to spend that much time searching for cups.", "Yeah, neither would I. That is such a rude thing to do. It's not like looking for the bathroom and opening the wrong door...", "It's just a Reddit thing, it's also totally normal in the US. People on this Subreddit are *obsessed* with private property. Literally no one offline has ever objected to someone rummaging around for a glass of water in a goddamn kitchen, and if someone does you should run away from that person as fast as possible."]}
