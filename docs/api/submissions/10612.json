Enough trust to leave you alone to go to the loo.  But not enough trust to have you help yourself to water?  \n\nThe lack of offer of refreshments is kinda rude, but also adds an informality to the date.... a lack of politeness on her part, leading to a guest in her home uncertain how to handle her private space and feeling uncomfortable through hunger or thirst.  You're not a kid that you should feel you need to ask for something so basic.\n\nSo your date contributed to this situation.  I also believe your explanation as to how the situation arose.  I don't think kitchen cupboards are private, but kitchen drawers are more private than cupboards... not the ones that clearly hold pots tho.  I think she was overly defensive and territorial, given she contributed to the necessity of you needing a drink.  So far...Not an AH.\n\n(What I would've done as host and guest is irrelevant.... for reference I would've shown a guest around so they knew where the bathroom was and so they could get to know me better, and I would've made food and drink readily available.   As a guest I would've gone looking for water, and if unable to find a glass without touching anything, I would've scurried back to my seat and waited until they were out of the bathroom.)\n\nBut.... you went badly wrong after that.

You can't just tell someone in their own home they are wrong for how they wish their home and themselves to be treated!  Their wishes may not align with your values, and that's a learning moment,  but they are never wrong in the scenario you describe!   Ever. \n\nAnd you show your own morals here to be unfortunately lacking.   If you've offended anyone, whether inadvertent or not, you don't believe you should simply apologise for hurting them.  You believe defending yourself and attacking them is correct.   Saying you're sorry they are angry with you is passive-aggressive, underhanded bullshit.   I'm disappointed you're such a person,  and hope that you can consider if this is the person you want to be to anyone in your future... let alone a potential partner.

The reason why it's kind of okay to open cabinets in this scenario is because there's other people around, and with people helping themselves already there's an acceptable level of chaos.\n\nIt's different when you're at the apartment of the woman you're dating, hanging out with just her, and you're in the kitchen alone while she's in the bathroom, completely unaware you've even left the couch. When it's your first time in her home, you should act like a guest and *ask* for water. Eventually, if you date long enough that is, you get comfortable enough and you know where the glasses are, you can start getting your own water. But definitely not on the first visit. You can tell us until you're blue in the face you \"only\" wanted water, but you need to understand how this looked to her: a guy she's only known for a few weeks was rooting through her stuff. Just because you're dating doesn't mean she has to let her boundaries down completely, *especially* if you only matched a few weeks ago. Trust builds over time.\n\nAlso, your apology sucks.

But I would encourage you to stop seeing this as a water issue, and instead see 3 underlying things:\n\n\n1.  Canceled consent:  I bet that as the householder, hosting a first visit, her antenna were pretty attuned to minding her space.  When you opened the cupboards without first asking, it removed her ability to express consent to an opening of something in your direction.  This probably felt heightened too, because it appears this was going to be the night on which she wanted to consent to sex with you.\n\n\n2.  Lack of empathy/awareness of her feelings:  When she pointed out the crossed boundary to you, like 97% of guys you went to facts and litigated her facts.  What didn't happen, was you didn't acknowledge her feelings.  It's not a concession or surrender to acknowledge another's feelings.  Just say, \"Hey, wow, I hear you about having a boundary, getting those crossed feels violating.   Thank you for looking out for yourself.\"  \n\n3.  Attempted day-after apology text which repeated the wrongs:  Here, do you see how your text referred to \"getting water?\"  To her ear, you are litigating the facts again.  She doesn't see it as recognizing her feelings.  I know you said the word sorry, but the term has no value to her because you are litigating, not empathizing.\n\nSee if you can view the occurrence through this lens.

When you're alone in someone's kitchen, particularly when you don't know that person, you should not be poking around for stuff.", "That's weird and irresponsible.", "It's almost elegantly cruel in a perverse way, lol.", "Knee jerk reaction involves you usually realizing you\u2019re wrong , dude you came on the World Wide Web looking for someone to defend your creepiness . This seems like a pattern of behavior . I imagine getting  you to admit fault is like .. well looking for a glass cup in a strangers cupboard - useless and makes no sense", "So one of two things happened then:\n\n- you got caught snooping and got super defensive as an overreaction. But you claim it didnt happen because she has \u2026 large drawers? Sure. \n- or she felt what you did made her uncomfortable and expressed that. You didnt think her feelings were valid and tried to discredit her \u201cboundaries as an excuse\u201d\n\nEither way, AH.", "you got caught going through her cabinets and drawers and your reaction was that she was being weird and controlling when she got upset?", ">I have never seen anyone use them for cups.\n\nWe do exist though. It's really common in my area, at least.", "One of my best friends still asks before getting water herself. She has been to my house too many times to count and she still says \"hey, Im gonna get some water\" and waits until I nod.", "Yeah, that's The usual course of action. You asked at least the first time, because you never know how individual people individual families feel about that kind of thing .\n\nI have a really close friend that I've known for a long time, who actually loves when people go through his kitchen, and try to rummage up a small snack or meal or something - because he thinks it means that they all feel close to each other .\n\nI would actually super hate someone going through my kitchen stuff, even if they were old friends .\n\nYou just never know about that kind of thing until you tap into it with the first - Hey can I get a glass for water?", "A kitchen is different than a bedroom though? You keep stuff that are more private in bedrooms like your underwear, medication, condoms, whatever. It just felt weird to me since there's nothing particularly private in a kitchen so her accusation that I was violating her privacy felt super defensive/accusatory for no reason.", "How so? It is much better than in the bathroom.", ">there's nothing particularly private in a kitchen so her accusation that I was violating her privacy felt super defensive/accusatory for no reason.\n\nNo, no, no, you don't get to just blow on past this...\n\nYou yourself truly believe there were some private things in there - which is why you literally rifled through all her kitchen drawers the second she left the room. She should be defensive about you! That's the correct feeling to have when a strange man is doing weird as fuck mind games with you while rummaging around in your personal belongings.", "\n>A kitchen is different than a bedroom though?\n\nBut you did say to feel at home? At home i can go to the bedroom and through the drawers. \n\nSee? That's the point. Even when someone is \"free\" to do whatever is still expected to not invade personal boundaries. \n\nAnd you don't know how private her things are around the house. You don't know if she has a drawer in the kitchen with paperwork for, let's say, taxes, since she's using all the prep space to sort it all out. \n\nYou also don't know if she has a save inside and cupboards, because it's a strange place to have one, so more secure. \n\nYou simply don't care about other's boundaries. Just admit to it. You feel your stuff is out of line, but you're perfectly happy to step all over her line.", "Plenty of people keep medication in the kitchen. You seem to have a real stumbling block with assuming your experience and feelings are universal.", "Here are some things people keep in their kitchens they may not want to keep hidden, or may not want people they barely know discovering:\n\n\\- valuable items, like family heirloom silverware or serving trays that someone may want to pilfer\n\n\\- the good whiskey, or nice wine they bought on a vacation and may be saving for a special occasion (in other words, they don't want their drunk friends chugging it at a house party)\n\n\\- drugs, like psychedelic mushrooms and weed edibles\n\n\\- medications or supplements that have to be taken with food\n\n\\- embarrassing junk drawers", "Especially for OP's first visit, and they had only been dating a few weeks. We don't know if that means like 3 weeks or 12 weeks. \nWomen usually have to have their guard up early in the relationship for any 'worries'. Inviting a guy over for the first time, her guard would definitely be up at least passively.", "You know what, I did keep mortgage and tax papers in my kitchen drawer for like a year. Maybe I just have a really good sense of security that no one I've been on several dates with is out to steal my SSN and stuff, but I can understand why women in particular might not have that sense of security. Point taken, thanks.", "Good point. I keep pills in the kitchen I'm supposed to have before I eat. I would prefer a new first to not look through anything I'm taking.", "Yup. My mom keeps her meds in the kitchen because she has to take them with food. Also, one of them is refrigerated.", "Add to that, there are knives in the kitchen. You are a strange man in her house looking through her kitchen. That's scary.", "Yup. One of the cupboards in my kitchen holds all of our meds / vitamins / first aid stuff etc.", "I\u2019m amazed this is the first comment I saw mentioning knives, that was my first thought!", "I have a drawer in our kitchen that holds all kinds of stuff that I'd be pissed if someone was going through.  Bills, tax paperwork, emergency cash, pet vaccination records, my precription info...  It's maybe an odd place to keep such things but it's my kitchen and that's what's convenient for me.\n\nIf I walked in from the bathroom and found someone with their nose in that drawer I'd be extremely suspicious and annoyed."]}
