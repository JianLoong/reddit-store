We were together for 14 years and have 3 young children 10,7,3. Our separation was for many reasons but the main ones were how my ex treated fatherhood as something he could just pick and chose to be involved in. For example if I wanted to go out at all, even grocery shopping, i either had to take the kids, ask a family memebr to baby sit or wait till after i put the kids to bed because he was too tried from work and it was my job(his words).\nWe have been separated for 6ish months and I have our kids 6 days of the week . Their dad has them every Friday after school until Saturday dinner time.  We are mostly civil and have done things with the kids together like going to the movies or the beach etc. My ex doesn't overly like Christmas and after a bunch of discussions we decided i would have the kids Christmas eve and Christmas morning before taking them out to his families house for the afternoon. My plan was always to drop them off and come back to pick them up later(he's working boxing day so I am having them), but his mother called me and asked what time me and the kids were getting to her house on Christmas.  When I said I was dropping them off she said absolutely not and that I had to stay and spend some time with the family. I am still on really good terms with his mum and 2 sisters and we all keep in contact as much as we did before my ex and I split. When I told my ex that his mum invited me to Christmas he got really angry and said he doesn't want me going and it's weird because they're not my family. \nI texted his mum that I didn't know if I would be coming to Christmas and I almost immediately got messaged by both his siblings telling me to ignore my ex and jsut come to Christmas with he family.\nWould I be the asshole if I went?", "created_utc": 1702856468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18kupp3/aita_if_i_go_to_my_exhusbands_family_christmas/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you do go, be prepared for him to get upset and leave.\n\nHe's feeling understandably rejected by both you and his immediate family. You have to figure out how to successfully coparent with him, so tread carefully.

I\u2019d schedule a ladies brunch or something to spend time with MIL and SILs. Unfortunately you need to coparent with him and not respecting his boundaries will set a bad precedent and give him an excuse to violate yours.

What I don\u2019t understand is why you have not continued with visiting with your children and their grandmother on non-holidays if you had been in the habit of doing so. That\u2019s really what you should be doing especially because you say the children are asking you to. Don\u2019t make the first Christmas harder than it already will be for all concerned. Explain to the children that daddy and his family want to see them for Christmas and that you are available to come get them if they want you to.

I was in the exact same situation years ago. Got on well with inlaws and invited to Xmas lunch first year of split. Whilst my ex didn't object (me still looking after the kids), it was still awkward. Everyone was nice enough but it is difficult to hold any sort of meaningful conversation about your family and future plans.  \n\nMy ex had visitation every other weekend but he still wanted me to take the kids to visit his family on my weekends. I told him that it is now his responsibility to organise the kids for his family and my weekends were mine to see my family. I gracefully declined future invitations from inlaws but still maintained communication for kids and we remained on good terms. My ex stepped up to the single dad role and we kept a flexible schedule to swap and change for family/work plans. \n\nYour ex doesn't want you at Xmas and this is a good opportunity for him and his family to see him in his new role as a single dad.

Best to respect his boundaries and let his time with his family be his own if that is his desire.  I doubt you\u2019d want him at your family\u2019s Christmas dinner, even if they invited him?  If you want to still have time with his mom and sisters, set that up separately but it seems unkind to dump the guy and then insist on still attending his family functions after he told you he doesn\u2019t want you there. Very uncool of his mom and sisters to override his wishes (he must really be a jerk). If you are serious about ending this relationship, it will likely require changing how you engage with his family.  My brother has been divorced over 15 years and his ex wife still tries to invite herself to our family events and it is very awkward - I genuinely like her but she is no longer part of our family\u2026if he was cool with it, that would be different, but he doesn\u2019t want her there and we as is family honor that.", "NTA, but I don't think you should go. You can have a relationship with the family, of course, but do it on your own time. He might eventually have another woman in his life, the family will have to accept her, and you being always there might be uncomfortable for him and his gf. Whether he uses his tima and space with his family, good or not, it is his prerogative to decide not to be with you in a holiday, and it would be nice for you to respect that. Do not misunderstand me, OF COURSE you will still be part of the family, but you both need some boundaries, and this seems reasonable.", "YTA, it\u2019s not your family", "lol at the people asking what the kids want. \n\nThe kids parents split up 6 months ago - of course they want their mom and dad to have Christmas together.  \n\nYTA if you go.  Kids don\u2019t know what is best for them and false expectations that parents might get back together because they spent Christmas together is not in their best interests. \n\nYou can also maintain a good relationship with your former MIL and SIL without attending the family Christmas.", "NTA but I don\u2019t understand why you would want to go. It\u2019s nice of his family to insist that you attend their gathering, but they\u2019re not the ones who have to coparent with your ex, you are. He doesn\u2019t want there and if you show up, it\u2019s guaranteed to cause issues between the two of you. Respecting each other\u2019s boundaries is a key aspect of any coparenting relationship. There are going to be times when you want space from him and when that happens, you\u2019re going to want him to respect that.", "YTA", "Ugh, this is tough. I'm going to go with a light YWBTA. I'm probably biased as I separated from my exwife 1.5 years ago. I totally understand what his family is doing, but I think it's pretty inappropriate for them to invite you behind his back and against his wishes.  It's really something they should have worked out between them.\n\nI could maybe see a not the asshole vote based on the fact that he sounds like a pretty shitty dad, so to hell with him. But I dunno, it's tough.\n\n6 months, the separation is still really fresh, and I'm sure having you around will completely ruin his holiday. I know my exwife and I are pretty amicable now, but it took some time to get there. I actually wish my family was MORE supportive and communicative with my ex, but they immediately went into over-protective of me mode and cut her out immediately.\n\nHonestly, I think the best option, as hard as it might be, might be to thank them for the offer, explain that you really appreciate the offer and their support, but you don't think it's appropriate this year, and say let's see if we can make it work next year....\n\nBut fuck, I dunno. This one hits a bit close to home and I dunno how much my own bias is affecting it.\n\nEdit: I see comments about the kids wanting you there. While I'm a big proponent of putting the kids first, I don't think putting them first necessarily means doing everything they want. Of course the kids want you there, it would be the first separate Christmas. They probably want you to get back together too. I think it might be best to start the new normal, which is doing things separately, now and not later. They need to get used to it. I also worry that it might give them false hopes of things returning to the old normal. I still struggle with this one myself. My exwife is taking the kids on a weekend getaway soon, and they keep asking me if I'm coming too (they are 3 and 6).  I have to tell them no, and it just kills me every time they ask why not. They still don't fully grasp the complete situation. Though overall they've adapted REALLY well.", "YWBTAH\n\nThe most important thing you can do for your kids is work to foster a LONG TERM coparenting relationship \n\nThis would probably tank that.   And honestly possibly harm the relationship between kids and their grandma/aunts, etc. as dad would have every reason to stop taking them someplace his boundaries aren\u2019t respected.", "YWBTA Big time. Unless you have your ex\u2019s explicit permission that\u2019s not coerced by guilt-tripping him thru his kids.\n\n6 months is far too little time for him to heal after a 14 year relationship. It\u2019s cruel to throw that into his face at such a special time - especially as it sounds like you dumped him! Maybe he\u2019ll be ready in 3-4 years, but that should be up to him.\n\nAlso, **it\u2019s OUTRAGEOUS to involve your kids in this discussion**. That\u2019s a HUGE parenting fail. Of course the kids want their parents back together, but they don\u2019t know ANYTHING about why you dumped him - especially at their ages. You\u2019re just baiting the kids to make your ex look like crap in front of his kids. \n\nThe rest of his family sucks for even considering inviting you without consulting their own son and brother. Do they even know the details of what happened? And why your ex might be soooo pissed off at them inviting you?\n\nYour separated. Joint parties are a 2 yes, one no decision. And you already have your 1 no. Just don\u2019t do it. And definitely don\u2019t blame your ex if it doesn\u2019t happen. You - and his family - never should\u2019ve put him in this position and the kids shouldn\u2019t even know you\u2019re talking about any of this.", "If you go then YTA. Thank them for their kind and polite offer but let them know your ex does not want you there and that it\u2019s kind of awkward. Get together with them after the holidays. Seems to me they like you more than they like him.", "YTA if you do that. You should aim to ensure a good and long lasting coparenting relationship with your ex and give your children stability. That means you have to set new boundaries for your new family structure and respect them. You should listen to your ex on this and respect his need to have his own family time as he is also healing. You risk conflict with ex, conflict between ex and his family, conflicts that will involve the children. What about next holiday? Or next Christmas? Will you show up when your ex is having Christmas with his new girlfriend? You should detangle when it\u2019s not a joint affair like a birthday or graduation and show your children this is how it\u2019s going to be.", "Please do not do this. Just don\u2019t. He won\u2019t just resent you, but he\u2019ll resent his family too. If the marriage is over, then they aren\u2019t your family anymore and everyone has to learn how to handle that.", "YWBTA.

He is more than happy to come to mine and have a \"family\" Christmas and he even invited me away for new years with the kids. It's simply about him noy wanting me to have any sort of contact with his family", "Unfortunately I  feel like if I don't go it will still have the same effect on my ex and mine relationship. He doesn't like my having any sort of contact and relationship with his family bwcuase I was the one to end our relationship.", "I think this is the way. Go, visit for a portion (30-90min since it's an all day thing) invite sisters and mom to a brunch or something and bow out for him to have additional family time. He'll still be mad but you are balancing the other people's asks as well.", "No he isn't. He still wants us to reconcile. His only reason for not wanting me there is becusse he believes that me separating from him means I have ti separate from his entire family and never see ot speak to them again", "Except the damage is already done. The moment he found out his mum and sisters invited me to Christmas he lost the plot.he believes I shouldn't have any sort of contact with his family at all because we are separated. Unless I never see or speak to anyone in his family again, he isn't going to be happy", "Perfect response.", "I just don't get why she should have to 'respect his space' when he spent his whole marriage not respecting her. I think she should do what's best for the kids. Besides, their grandparents invited her. When you have a child(ren) with someone, that person will be in your life as long as the kids are. The ex needs to get over himself.", "He doesn't have a need for space. He is the one who needs to figure it out.\n There is no way I am willing to respect his wishes because his wishes are that I stop any and all contact with every member of his family and never see or contact them again. Those people sre my family and have been my family for 14 years. His sisters are 2 years younger than me and are as much my sisters as my blood sisters are. \nIf he was genuinely hurt or upset about our relationship ending and needed space then yes I would respect that but he isn't. He wants me to go away with him and the kids for new years. He has no issue with us spending time together. He simply doesn't want me to have anything to do with his family because he's angry.", "I want to go because they are my family. 14 years of them being my family. His mother was there for the birth of all 3 of my children, and we used to see them at least once a week before the split. One of his sisters and i also had all 3 of our babies within weeks of eachother so we havr been spending time every week with thevkids growing up. Now I talk to them often but I haven't seen them because my ex has been very vocal about me having any sort of relationship with his family so wr havr all been trying to respect that and not stir anyrhing up by visiting.", "NTA", "If be choses not to take the kids to see his family becuase of the relationship I have with them then I will take them instead, I'm not going to let them niss out just becusse he is angry.", "He gets them once a week due to his own choices , it wouldn\u2019t hurt the relationship with his grandma and aunts. The family made it a point to invite her , she wasn\u2019t going to go until they insisted. If he can\u2019t be mature that\u2019s on him.", "Did you read the post? Dude barely parented in the first place. Sounds like the in-laws know their son/brother is an idiot and want to salvage a relationship with the only adult parent.", "On what planet do we call a 6d6h/18h split a \"coparenting relationship\"? Guy is a deadbeat, likely will continue to be a deadbeat. She loses nothing by going and having a good time.", "Christmas is as much a joint affair as birthdays. They're about family and his family has been my family for over 14 years. I would respect his wishes if he genuinely was upset about me being there for sny reason other than being angry that I decided to separate. He has admitted the only reason he doesn't want me there is becuase I chose to separate so therefor I can't havr any sort of relationship or communication with his family. If it was up to him I would never talk to anyone in his famiy ever again. He invited me to spend new years with him and the kids and go away for a few nights, but he doesn't want me to havr contact with his family at all.\nIf he had a new relationship then it would likely be different but he doesn't.", "It sounds like dude is a dick he doesn\u2019t get to punish her for being a bad husband", "Except it's not his parenting time. Christmas is my day, but we decided I would drop them off at his parents' house for their family Christmas that they do as the kids were invited. And I was also invited.", "He is. He is spending the whole day with his family.  They do a big Christmas eve thing at his mums house and all the adult children stay the night then they have Christmas morning jsut immediate family and invite the extended grandparents and aunties/unclea/cousins for the afternoon/dinner. So If I went it would be to the extended family thing.", "I feel like at this point, it's already drama, so me going to the family christmas isn't going to be much more.\n He's already angry that I'm still speaking and spending time with his family. \nI'm Definitely leaning towards going to it. Partially so I can see all the cousins and aunts/uncles that i haven't seen in a while. But mainly because I genuinely love his family as my own, I've brought them presents and I'm looking forward to spending Christmas with them. I haven't spent much time with them the last 6 months as I was trying to respect ny exs wishes but its definitely been hard for me.", "I honestly don't think he will start a fight. We have had many arguments about the way he speaks infront of the kids and I believe if he wants to say something he will wait till another time when the kids aren't around. If anything I think he is more likely to jsut ignore me unless I ask him something directly.", "You were married to the man for several years. You have the grandchildren. Of course you are still part of HIS family whether he likes it or not. You will always stay in contact to notify them of something great that happens in your kid's lives. If you want to go, go. You were invited. Ex can pound sand", "you\u2019re not the one being the asshole. The kids should come first anyway, even more so at Christmas and this is their first one experiencing it without you both. Just go - you have enough support already from his mum and sisters to not make it awkward for you and they will likely dress him down if he creates an atmosphere. Even if he does, the kids will see it and it\u2019s up to him if he wants them to see that selfish side.", "The kids desires should win 100% here. Your ex is acting like a massive pratt. Go and enjoy yourself. You\u2019d be an asshole to your kids if you didn\u2019t go.", "That's his opinion, not a fact, and clearly not his family's opinion.", "His logic is broken. Does that mean you need to leave the children you had with him too? LOL", "Ignore him. His mom decided that she wants you there. She can determine if it's at a different time than when she invited her son. \n\nI would confirm with her that if he is there and makes a scene, what she would like you to do. Asking that question, you already know the answer..... but it does show that you are a better person and you care about how the \"host\" deals with an unruly guest - even when it is her own adult son. But it also lets you know how to handle things if it goes sideways. 99.9% of the time she's going to tell you that she will kick him out.", "Nope go anyway, he doesn't get to decide if you have a relationship with them. If he wasn't a pick and choose parent he wouldn't even be in this situation.", "That's not how it works though. You are the mother of his children and those children are grandchildren and cousins and nieces/nephews to his family.\n\nHe's going to have to suck it up.", "NAH. I would probably just drop the kids off on this one. However I would arrange a time maybe on Boxing Day to go and visit Nana.", "That is not his choise.", "Sounds like you got custody of the kids *and* his family in the divorce. You\u2019re allowed to have a relationship with his family independent of him. It may fade out as time goes on, but everything is still very fresh for all of you. Even they may just be craving a bit of \u201cnormality\u201d in all of this. Go to his family occasions for now and allow distance to grow gradually. Considering how terrible a father it sounds like it is, maintains a good relationship with his family may help your kids further down the line.", "It\u2019s possible he would rather not have you in contact with them in order to make sure the version of events he has given them is not revealed? They say there\u2019s two sides to every story and it\u2019s quite likely that the side he gave his family made him sound less at fault and he is concerned that things may come undone through general conversation.\nI\u2019m going with NTA though, the main concern here is what is best for the kids and having a functioning family unit is obviously best if it can be maintained after a divorce! He is putting himself first rather than thinking of what is best for his children, from your post it sounds like that is pretty standard for him though.", "He cannot speak on behalf of his family. If they want a relationship with their grandchildren\u2019s mother, that\u2019s up to them. \n\nAnd your husband is a terrible father, BTW. I don\u2019t care if I get downvoted, but he has deliberately avoided intimate time with his kids as a dad, not to mention the obvious - a terrible partner. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t want you there because he\u2019s jealous his family likes you more and has more respect for you than  him as a parent.\n\nEdit: more respect for you THAN him (not for him)", "But that's kind of understandable, isn't it?", "It\u2019s too bad.\n\nI mean, even if it is unreasonable, that attitude is pretty common. If the goal is to make things between you and him as smooth as possible (though still not smooth) I\u2019d tell him that even though you would like to go, you aren\u2019t going to solely because he doesn\u2019t want you to.  In the long run he may remember that.\n\nBut in any case NTA.\n\n(Edit to correct typo: as I said earlier, NTA.)", "Lol. No. What an idiot he is.\n\nDon't reconcile with him either.", "You will always be connected to the family through the kids", "No, he doesn't want you there because if you can only see them through him, and you miss them, then that's leverage he can use to force you to reconcile. \n\nThis is about isolating you, and making the kids unhappy that you're not there, so that he can wear you down with those things. \n\nSo now you get to pick: whose desires here win? Your kids'? Your ex's? Your kids' family's? Yours? The way it seems, it's three to one in favour of 'go' - why are you prioritizing the one?", "From what you said in the post and comments it seems like he is trying to punish you. You finally stood up for yourself and he is not liking it. This is your family as well as your children's. Did others not read the comment where YOU alone took the kids to see the in laws every week? Where was he when you wew visiting HIS family? Why was it okay then but not now? His focus should be on the kids not his ego.", "I get it but you can spend time with his family any other time. You don\u2019t need his permission to do that. Let him have Christmas to himself this year. It\u2019s only been six months since your separation and you\u2019re the one who initiated it. Maybe next year or the year after, he won\u2019t feel as strongly about you spending time with his family, but right now it might be best to give him his space.", "My Grandma continued to foster a relationship with my dad after my parents divorced.  I lost so much respect for her seeing how she disrespected her own daughter (who had done nothing wrong).  \n\nThis is disrespectful, people don\u2019t forget that easily", "And when he has them he cuts out the other family?  You really don\u2019t think that won\u2019t have impact?  Putting all onus on ex. Or him being even more resistant to involving anyone who would betray him?\n\nWe are constantly telling people to maintain boundaries.  Family that chooses your ex over you is 100% family most would feel they\u2019re better off without", "Some people can get better or learn.  Cutting em off at the knees doesn\u2019t help\n\nMaybe he never will, but this is still is a completely unnecessary act", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be the AH, however, I wouldn\u2019t go. I\u2019m not saying this for him, I just don\u2019t know how comfortable you\u2019d be with him there. You know him best, is he going to make it awkward or tense for you if he doesn\u2019t get his way? I wouldn\u2019t want to spend my Christmas holiday that way. He sounds like a dick so I wouldn\u2019t put it past him. His family sounds like they care about you, tell them that you still see them as family but don\u2019t want things to be uncomfortable at Christmas since the breakup is still pretty recent. If they\u2019re reasonable people, they\u2019ll understand. And your ex will end up looking worse for this.", "Yeah, he definitely doesn't see it like that. He thinks because I chose to end the relationship between us that I also chose to end any relationship I have with anyone in his family.\nWe have had many arguments over me talking to his family still since we split.", "That's kind of my thoughts. When we were together i was the one who took the kids to see his family each week by myself and typically I was the one to go to the family events with them and he would show up separately and the kids and I would go home earlier than him at bedtime. I also have always been the one to chase them round and sort food etc at family events .", "I genuinely don't think the relationships I have with his family will fade. It's been 14 years, we lived with his family for almost 3 years including the first year of our eldest sons life. We also lived with them again for a few months right before our youngest was born whole we were waiting for our house construction to finish. His mum was present for all 3 of my kids' births and the kids and I had seen her atleast once a week before my ex and I split.  He has never overly liked how close I was to his family and I think thsts because he's the only boy and he doesn't get along with either of his sisters husband's.", "I mean it's possible he's told them things that aren't true about our separation. But i know he has been at least somewhat truthful about his issues and behavior that contributed to our split because both his sisters and his mum have mentioned things that I haven't told them about our relationship.", "What is? him not wanting me to have any contact with his family?  I wouldn't say it's understandable. If we had only been dating a short time then yes but it's been over 14 years of me being part of their family. Dropping contact immediately and never seeing or speaking to them again is unreasonable. If we weren't close with his family then sure, but the kids and I saw them weekly and spoke more frequently. For 14 years we built a life together with family snd friends, him not wanting me to havr any contact with any of them now we are separated is not understandable.", "He is the one creating the problem.  She could bail him out at her cost, but the best thing for the kids would be to see everyone capable of getting alone. The only person getting in the way of that is the ex.\n\nIf she chooses to go, he\u2019ll get over it.", "OP stated they have a good relationship with them , even if he did cut them off they would still see that side of the family because OP would bring them over. No one is betraying him , he doesn\u2019t want to be a full time parent or even a half time parent. It\u2019s his mom\u2019s home and she can invite anyone she wants , even his siblings want her there . We don\u2019t have the full back story, but it sounds like they know how he is, and they value the relationship they built with her and still want her around.", "It's only one day that they would get cut out, sounds like mom still has a good relationship with them and would still let the kids see them.", "My aunt and her husband split when her kids are young. Their kids are adults now and she is still invited to her in laws for holidays - the ex is only sometimes invited.\n\nYou don't need to keep discussing this with him. He had his say and you are not obligated to keep trying to convince him.", "You need to have your MIL step up and tell him that he's got no control over who she invites to *her* house, that *she* wants you there, *she* invited you, and *she* will make the rules in *her* home, not him.", "He sounds very controlling.", "Then it sounds like his family needs to set him straight. Family isn't always blood. Family is who you choose.", "Well too bad for him.\n\n\"His\" family is your kids family, your friends, and a support system for you and the kids. You have the kids most of the time so it's actually better for the kids if you keep visiting his family. Then they won't miss out on time with grandma and their aunts.", "Yup go anyway, they want you there he will have to suck it up.", "The fact you have a genuine and independent relationship with his family means he\u2019s going to just have to get used to it to an extent. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll always have a good relationship with them, but as both of you move on and meet other partners, it\u2019s natural that you\u2019ll distance yourself a bit more. There\u2019s no need to force distance now just because he\u2019s too emotionally immature to deal with this like an adult, but it may help you move on and forward if you allow some distance to grow.", "So the question is, do you want to punish and cut off these people who you care about and who have supported you, and limit access to their nibblings/grandkids, to make your ex feel better?\n\nI'd say don't. I get it sucks for your ex, but too bad. He should have watched his own children while you went to the grocery store. He thinks he's the victim in this divorce but he's not.", "Well, I understand it.\n\nI'm not saying you need to drop contact with them, I'm just saying it's natural for him to not want it.\n\nHe'll probably get over it when it stops being so raw, and he starts thinking about how it will negatively affect his kids. Or at least, one would hope so.", "His family and I have had many conversations about our relationship and the breakdown of it. He has also spoken to them about it and told them a lot more about it than I had, and I know that because they have mentioned stuff to me that I hadn't told them.\nHis family are amazing and they are very insistent that I go to it because it's a big family event and I am family.", "It wouldn\u2019t be a one day impact.\n\nIt is completely reasonable to not want your ex had your family events.  If you can heal and get to that place, that\u2019s AWESOME, but both need to be there.\nDon\u2019t force this when they aren\u2019t both ok with it", "I think you are being far too kind. Her ex is a total clich\u00e9 of the failed husband who doesn't want his family to know what a stinker he was to the wife they've come to think of as their own family.  It's unfortunate for him that they already know him to be the one at fault here, and that they love OP for who she and want the best for her and the kids.  OP is NTA and the family's insistence that she be there for the holidays without bothering to tell their son/brother kind of says it all about his standing among those who know him well.  I hope their relationship continues to overflow with love and family feeling that fills the children with love and a sense of security.  Whether the ex can grow up and catch up is his problem, not OP's.", "They actually aren\u2019t amazing if they\u2019re rejecting the feelings of their own son and brother\n\nThey should absolutely NOT be inviting you with out his consent and comfort with it\n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t have any contact with them, just don\u2019t get in the middle of the holidays.  Very strong likelihood of doing further permanent damage to your ability to coparent.  That should matter to you more"]}
