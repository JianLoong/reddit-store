Since we started, I was interested in one of my classmates, \u201cMyra\u201d, and I developed a bit more than a crush on her. I had asked her out casually a her times but she never seemed that interested, saying she wanted to focus on school. Which I got and was cool with, especially because her drive and ability to not get involved in petty stuff was part of why I was attracted to her. I would still hang out with her and we were sometimes in group study sessions, which is when I heard something kind of surprising. She was joking around with some of the other girls about being too old for some thing they had been into while younger, and one the girls asked what Myra meant by that. Myra then said, \u201cwell, I\u2019m 31, and was like 20 at the time\u201d and then laughed. I think we were all pretty surprised, probably me more than anybody because I felt like she had made us all look stupid.  She\u2019s older than all of us, and I think it\u2019s weird that she never told anyone before. I told her that, and she just gave me a funny look and said sorry. I told her she had been lying to us for two years and that was pretty shitty of her, and just left.

People dont have to share their age the instant they meet others. YTA", "Lmao wait she \"lied to you\" because she didn't actively offer up her precise age without being asked?

To lie to someone you have to lie about something, she just didn\u2019t discuss her age with you.

What, this woman was supposed to make sure she announced her age to each of the maybe 150 members of her class alone?

At least consider she maybe isn't going to medical school to try and hook up with you.", "you have issues. Major issues", "Why? It seems like it would\u2019ve been appropriate for her to tell you if she had had any interest in saying yes, but she said no.", "This would only be relevant if she had been interested in you and wanted to pursue a relationship. She wasn\u2019t, so you\u2019re not really entitled to her personal information.", "Why? She rejected you. She owes you nothing. If her age was incredibly important to you, why didn't you ever bother to ask? \n\nDo you just go through life assuming everyone's characteristics are all exactly like yours and feel betrayed if they are different from you and don't shout it from the rooftops? \n\nWork through your issues. None of them is this woman lying to you.", "So, by your own information, the conversation should have gone:\n\nHey, I like you, wanna date?\n\nNo, I'm 30.\n\nYTA - Did you even need to ask?\n\nGrow up.", "She doesn't owe you anything, and you're an AH for assuming she does. My in laws are 10 years apart, it's not a big deal unless you make it one. \n\nYTA", "Why though? Lots of people have 10 year age gap. The age gap clearly wasn\u2019t a factor in her rejection", "But she turned you down so her age is a moot point. Had she agreed to the date and a relationship had happened you\u2019d have a good point but\u2026that\u2019s not this situation.", "No. And while we\u2019re on the subject it would have been incredibly appropriate of you to back the fuck off when she turned you down the first time instead of asking her out multiple times", "How about her age is none of your fucking business, whether you\u2019re interested in her or not? She doesn\u2019t owe you a damn thing.", "Holy shit Tate, no. She's not interested. You kept trying, then felt bamboozled when you found out she was 31 and feel betrayed because someone who wasn't interested in you and was focused on her work didn't randomly go around saying \"IM 31 YALL!\"\n\nShe does not owe you a damn thing. The fact that \"everyone was shocked\" but your reaction got you called an asshole sounds like her age only meant something to you. Because you feel betrayed by someone who showed no interest in you. YTA, no question here man.", "Yeah, because you did so well in leaving her alone after you asked her the first time, so she should have been inclined to tell you even more? Because men have had the perfectly clean history of positive responses when women have been honest with/rejected them? \n\nYour reaction alone is the reason why she hasn\u2019t said anything until now. You seriously need to cope and move on. Maybe find a whole new med cohort because wow you took \u201cshitting where you eat\u201d to a whole new level. YTA.", "You\u2019re living proof that there\u2019s a massive difference between being book smart and being Street smart. \n\nGood on you got getting into me school, but boy are you dumb.", "Her age is absolutely none of your business. It doesn't matter that you were interested in her.\n\nYou're butthurt about being rejected. Get over it, you monumental weirdo.", "What a strange way of thinking. You came onto her and she refused. Why is she socially obligated to disclose her age?", "Why do you think you're owed this information?\n\nShe said no. She doesn't owe you anything else", "No is a full sentence", "No, if a woman in her mid 20s asked out a man who happened to be several years older *and he wasn\u2019t at all interested* exactly no one would think he was obliged to share his age. That\u2019s just a bizarre expectation no matter how you try to phrase it and clearly it\u2019s influenced by you feeling rejected and being salty about it.", "BFFR. \n\nIt would have been appropriate if she accepted the date and entered a relationship with you, but she rejected you.

Your totally immature.\n\nShe didnt have to tell you shit. she declined you more than once and you are now butt hurt cause you assumed she was your age??? YTA.\n\nYou sure your not 12? You are acting like a 12 year old who got their ass handed to them on Call of duty.", "I am 37.88621 years old, since that is required communication in order to reject you. YTA.", "Yeah no.", "oh gosh, why does that app give me the creepy crawlies? :o", "Of course she doesn\u2019t. But op is hinting that she lying. She was never asked and therefor never lied.", "It's just odd that you have what appears to be an excessive fixation with age and opaque rules of decorum around it, but you then casually refer to her as a girl. I have nothing more to base my opinions on than what you've provided here, so if you say you're not an incel, then sure, you're not an incel. But I'll earnestly caution you that what you've written in this post *really* suggests some dark attitudes toward women, and I hope you'll reflect on that and work on it. Good luck.", "exactly what an incel would say.", "Her age isn\u2019t your business. She doesn\u2019t owe you an explanation of her age. Why would you think she lied to you? She didn\u2019t say she was 20, that would be lying. Did you just randomly offered up your age? Did you ask her her age? I can\u2019t see how you think she lied. She didn\u2019t lie, you assumed. You were rude. You owe her an apology", "A dude lied to me about his age once, by omission. I just said oh! So you\u2019re 25! Cool\u201d like no big deal he didn\u2019t say anything. Fast forward about a year and a half past we\u2019d been dating, turns out he was two years younger when we met. I would have not gone for that because I\u2019d have known I was more than 5 years older than him. But no, he lied by omission. \n\nSee, this is different from your situation because she owed you nothing.", "I\u2019m mid 30\u2019s but have ALWAYS looked much younger than I am. I also work in service industry and refer to my employees as \u201cmy work kids\u201d since most of them are actually closer to my children\u2019s age than mine. Their minds are *blown* when they find out how old I am, how many kids I have, and how old my actual children are. Never ever ever have I had someone *mad* at me for being my age. His response is disgusting and says way more about him than anything else.", "Also older, 48, and people always think I\u2019m in my 30s. Not my fault if someone decides I\u2019m younger and I don\u2019t assume that\u2019s what they think and correct them.

It's actually none of your business whatsoever.

Period.\n\nYTA", "By nearby\u2026 do you mean stalking her?", "Because she has ruined his little fantasy/obsession with her now. He's a creep.", "I think the issue is the age difference is a reason he wouldn't want to date *her.* He's embarrassed that he was accidentally attracted to an old. And if he had known, he wouldn't have had to ask her out and get rejected, or feel insecure about the rejection. How dare she withhold information that would have made him feel superior to her and immune to rejection? \n\nUnfortunately this phenomenon of men thinking women owe them a date, or owe them some kind of magical rejection that won't hurt their egos, is not rare.", "Literally just childish to assume everyone is the same age as you - egocentric, much? \n\nOP is only mad because he paid ZERO attention to actually becoming interested in her and only cared about his fantasy of her he made up in his head.
