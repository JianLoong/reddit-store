Since we started, I was interested in one of my classmates, \u201cMyra\u201d, and I developed a bit more than a crush on her. I had asked her out casually a her times but she never seemed that interested, saying she wanted to focus on school. Which I got and was cool with, especially because her drive and ability to not get involved in petty stuff was part of why I was attracted to her. I would still hang out with her and we were sometimes in group study sessions, which is when I heard something kind of surprising. She was joking around with some of the other girls about being too old for some thing they had been into while younger, and one the girls asked what Myra meant by that. Myra then said, \u201cwell, I\u2019m 31, and was like 20 at the time\u201d and then laughed. I think we were all pretty surprised, probably me more than anybody because I felt like she had made us all look stupid.  She\u2019s older than all of us, and I think it\u2019s weird that she never told anyone before. I told her that, and she just gave me a funny look and said sorry. I told her she had been lying to us for two years and that was pretty shitty of her, and just left.

People dont have to share their age the instant they meet others. YTA", "Lmao wait she \"lied to you\" because she didn't actively offer up her precise age without being asked?

To lie to someone you have to lie about something, she just didn\u2019t discuss her age with you.

What, this woman was supposed to make sure she announced her age to each of the maybe 150 members of her class alone?
