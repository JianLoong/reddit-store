How selfish to only think of his own comfort while our child is sick \n\nParents don't need to martyr themselves when their kids are sick. \n\nI have two grown kids. I've been through it.

I worked early the next day and he would be off so he didn\u2019t even think that maybe he should be the one to get up if she needed something ? \n\nIt's not a contest of who needs more sleep.

I have severe tinnitus from operating loud machinery for the past 25 years, and absolutely cannot sleep in a quiet room, and it is absolutely unsafe for me to go to work and operate said machinery if I haven\u2019t slept. \n\nAlso, your child is five years old and has a cold, for crying out loud. You don\u2019t need to listen out for her like that. A kid that age is perfectly capable of calling out for you or coming to your room while she need anything.

(Her bedroom is right next to ours and if we leave the doors open I could hear her if she got worst).\n\nWell, if you keep phrasing like this everything related to take care of your common daughter, that will not change. I think it clearly reflects how the child care is addressed at your family: \"I would be able to listen\", \"I could hear her\" instead of \"we as parents\". If that's the case, and while I am not saying you are thr only one to blame because it is both your fault, I would say it is unrealistic to think he will suddenly realise he also has responsabilites regarding being alert to your daughter's coughing.", "YTA for being passive-aggressive. If your daughter were a baby, or if she were more seriously ill, that'd be a different story, but your husband is not selfish or neglectful for thinking a five-year-old with a cold probably doesn't need overnight monitoring.

If she had pneumonia or already has other lung issues that would warrant extra worry, it may be different.\n\nObviously, he's in the same mindset as most of us that have raised children... it's a cold, and she is of the age to seek out help if needed by yelling or coming to the room. \n\nI understand you had to get up early, but it doesn't seem like turning off his white noise was essential with the information given, just a request that made no sense to him given the situation.

What\u2019s the problem.", "Eh, soft yta? I mean, it sounds like maybe he was a bit grumpy, but did you talk about it? Sounds like you both have very different ideas about how serious this cold is.

Would you please listen for child?\"  You went with the assumption (which you clearly already resented) that you would be the one, asked husband to turn off the white noise machine, likely meaning that he couldn't sleep, and then got pissed when he went with a different solution. \n\nUse your words people.", "YTA   \nAre you worried your daughter's head might explode?
