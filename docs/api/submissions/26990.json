You don\u2019t need to listen out for her like that. A kid that age is perfectly capable of calling out for you or coming to your room while she need anything.

(Her bedroom is right next to ours and if we leave the doors open I could hear her if she got worst).\n\nWell, if you keep phrasing like this everything related to take care of your common daughter, that will not change. I think it clearly reflects how the child care is addressed at your family: \"I would be able to listen\", \"I could hear her\" instead of \"we as parents\".

I made a first comment and now I am just following the conversation about it and clarifying what I meant. I am not bashing at anyone, I am giving my opinion. You don't know if it as healthy dynamic either. And you definetely don't need to be rude and imply I need help. Help with what?", "Even though I agree with you, I can't believe how pedantic this conversation has become.", "What's tfg?", "Help with finding a lick of sense \ud83d\udc80. You pressed someone for saying their husband helped them. Take your projections back to twitter."]}
