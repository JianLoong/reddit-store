You don\u2019t need to listen out for her like that. A kid that age is perfectly capable of calling out for you or coming to your room while she need anything.

(Her bedroom is right next to ours and if we leave the doors open I could hear her if she got worst).\n\nWell, if you keep phrasing like this everything related to take care of your common daughter, that will not change. I think it clearly reflects how the child care is addressed at your family: \"I would be able to listen\", \"I could hear her\" instead of \"we as parents\".
