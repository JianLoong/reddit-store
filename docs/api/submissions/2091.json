You better believe I have options for her to eat. \n\nWe had a birthday party for my fianc\u00e9e and invited her. I didn't have time to cook tons of stuff for her, but I made sure to bake cookies she could enjoy and got her pizza that fit her needs (with help from her wife). I also made sure to buy chips, crackers, and brownies (since I couldn't find gluten-free cupcakes) so that she would feel included. \n\nYour dietary restrictions suck and the people who love you should want to make sure you have things available that you enjoy.", "I don't know where you are but if it's the USA or Canada, Kinnikinnick has several products that are vegan and all of them are free from the top 8 allergens including nut, peanut, and gluten.", "Awesome, I\u2019ll hope they make their way to the uk where I am based. Thanks for the tip!", "Terrible metaphor.", "The metaphor made sense to me--you likened the situation to giving someone a poisonous gas to breathe, just like SIL gave OP poisonous food to eat.", "I\u2019m trying to perfect vegan/gf baking (me coeliac, some family vegan). I can\u2019t use oats as they\u2019re not considered gluten free in Australia and I react to them (no everyone does though).", "That sounds delicious. Now I want fruit crumble \ud83e\udd24", "Red tractor do a wheat free oats, you can get it at Coles, might be worth checking out?", "I'm same, something about even the certified gf oats doesn't sit right with me. It's so disappointing as there's no even passable sub for oats. Breads, biscuits, cakes, weetbix etc are good now, but porridge? Even Anzac biscuits, are just not good without real oats", "Assuming nuts are okay, you can make peanut butter cookies with a 1:1 ratio of peanut butter and sugar. Then roll into balls and flatten with a fork, and bake for about 10 minutes. So good.", "So easy to make!!", "It\u2019s not the cross contamination, it\u2019s the actual protein that I react to the same as would with wheat rye or barley. And our threshold of ppm (parts per million) of gluten to be declared gluten free is a lot stricter than say the US/Europe [we can\u2019t have *any* detectable gluten but others say 20 ppm is considered gluten free.]", "Anzac biscuits \ud83d\ude2b"]}
