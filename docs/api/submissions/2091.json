We live with his mom and sister, who both have health issues (FIL passed away recently). My SIL insisted on making me a cake, which was very nice of her considering her health and mobility issues. She asked what flavor of cake I like and I told her. And reminded her of my dietary restrictions (definitely not a choice or preference). She knew about one of them but seemed to forget about the second. She seemed to get upset that my restrictions limited what kind of cake she could make but said she\u2019d see what she could do. I told her I have the supplies that meet my restrictions so she didn\u2019t have to buy them. I also offered to just buy a dessert I could eat so I wouldn\u2019t inconvenience her (or anyone else). She talked to my husband and asked about my restrictions and how bad the symptoms were for me. She then told him she could only meet one of the restrictions and not the other. \n\nMy husband said I\u2019m TA because his sister is doing something nice for me and I should just take a small bite at the party to be nice (even if it makes me extremely ill). \n\nI took a small bite at the party and got sick that evening. I got a separate cake for everyone else to enjoy since not everyone has the same restrictions as me. I wasn\u2019t able to eat any of other desserts. Part of me worries that I\u2019m TA/a spoiled brat for wanting food I could eat and the other part of me feels that because it was my birthday, I should have had a dessert I could fully enjoy without worrying that I could get sick.

NTA. Sister in law is  massive jerk because she absolutely could have made something or shouldn't have offered. And hubby is a jerk for siding with his sister over your actual health. No you are not the jerk for wanting to be able to eat the food at your own party. Don't ever let someone guilt you into eating any foods no matter if they make you sick or not. No is a full answer. They should both be embarrassed by the way they treated you", "NTA, but your SIL and your husband certainly qualify.", "NTA.  If she can't meet both of the restrictions, she's not qualified to provide the cake.", "NTA but does your husband routinely demand you compromise your health to appease others?", "NTA \n\nI'm beyond shocked that happened to you when it's YOUR birthday and you couldn't even have a cake that you could eat. Your husband apparently doesn't have your back, belittling your medical restrictions, calling you TA and urging you to eat something that you knew would make you sick. And he professes to love you???\n\nYou must start being your own advocate. They obviously aren't looking out for your best interests and don't care about your health and well-being. That wasn't your birthday cake she made for you. It was a half-assed cake she made to fool everyone into thinking she cares about you.", "NTA. Your dietary restrictions should have been accommodated. Next time, don't make yourself sick to please other people.", "NTA I feel bad for you that you have to ask that question. You absolutely should be allowed to have a cake you can eat on YOUR OWN birthday. Your SIL is being awful.", "Definitely NTA. Health related food restrictions do not require you to be nice. Why should you be physically ill so someone else\u2019s feelings aren\u2019t hurt? Particularly someone who has the opportunity to actually do something nice and make you something that you CAN eat.", "NTA. And seriously, does your husband really want you to have a bite of a cake that will make you ill? That's an extra special way to end your birthday celebrations", "NTA Why is this so hard for people to do?  How is it for you if you cannot eat it?  You are supposed to appreciate something that will make you ill?  Uh\u2026thanks?", "Your husband is TA. Does he think you're faking the food issues?  Or does he just not care? She couldn't figure out how to make a safe for you cake. It happens. The gesture was still there. If you or your husband buying one you can eat is a problem for anyone, then I guess it's their party.", "NTA. It\u2019s ridiculous for someone to expect you to eat something that you\u2019re allergic to or eat something that you\u2019re not necessarily allergic to but your doctor says you can\u2019t have. If they can\u2019t make something that you can eat, or aren\u2019t willing to, then they need to not make a big deal over you bringing something you can eat. That\u2019s really weird of them making you out to be the bad guy for trying to appease everyone despite your allergies. I\u2019d have just straight up said nope. Can\u2019t eat it without having negative consequences so y\u2019all have fun while I eat the food I brought with me that won\u2019t make me hurl.", "\u201cIt\u2019s rude/obnoxious to demand that someone must make themselves sick. Health is more important\u201d.  That is the response as soon as anyone suggests you eat something you cannot eat.  Every single time.  Choose between rude and obnoxious depending on the situation.  Don\u2019t argue, just keep saying it.", "NTA, but Jesus\u2026 both of them are.\n\nShe really went out of her way to get you some ammonia, stop being rude and breathe just a little bit.", "NTA. In the slightest. At all.\n\n\u201cMy sister said I\u2019m TA because his sister is doing something nice for me.\u201d Making you a cake that will make you sick and insisting you eat it is not nice.\n\nYour husband is the biggest AH here for not shutting down his sister the second she reached out to him to ask how bad the symptoms here, then calling YOU the AH. Does he often make you second guess perfectly reasonable requests like \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me a birthday cake that will make me vomit\u201d?", "NTA. Your SIL tried at least, so I\u2019d say she\u2019s NTA either.

You buy another cake that you also can't eat. Some unspecified person provides other desserts that you can't eat.\n\nESH\n\nYour SIL who surely knows about your restrictions because you live together, and could figure out that making a cake with one of the forbidden ingredients is not going to work.\n\nYour husband for throwing a party, allowing his sister to make a cake you can't eat without getting one you can, and telling you to eat something that's going to make you sick.\n\nYou, for getting another cake you can't have, but not one you could eat; for sampling something you knew would make you sick; and for not just telling both of them no in the first place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
