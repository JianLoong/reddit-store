They don\u2019t even care about your health.", "NTA. Your husband told you to poison yourself and you are wondering if you\u2019re in the wrong?", "NTA. And what kind of man are you with, one that is ok with you being sick.  That is wrong in so many ways to me.", "I can't get over the part where SIL asked what OP's symptoms were. She very obviously knew she won't be catering to OP's allergies, and just wanted to know if she'll be committing murder or just casually poison her...\n\nI've read a lot of entitled bullshit on this sub, but this fucking one, quite literally, *takes the cake*.", "NTA Seriously, as someone who can\u2019t have dairy or gluten I would toss the whole group to the curb. The second someone hints I could just have a little I would not have continued being involved with them. This isn\u2019t a friend, this isn\u2019t an acquaintance, this is supposed to be a partner. \n\nScrew your husband, screw his family. Screw ANYONE who thinks your health isn\u2019t worth them not doing what they want (which is watching you eat something you can\u2019t.) And that\u2019s the truth, you *can\u2019t* eat those things. \n\nI understand this might have happened after you started dating or married your husband. But if he\u2019s not supportive, leave. That may seem extreme to many, but for someone who has intolerances or allergies\u2026 this is a fact of life. We have no choice but the be with people that care about our well being.", "It didn\u2019t even sound like SIL had an issue really, just that she was trying to understand how bad OP\u2019s symptoms could be. OP did say she had the ingredients, but maybe SIL didn\u2019t know how to properly make a cake with those ingredients. \n\nThe HUSBAND however, is a Major AH. There were no issues, and there were even compromises set in place. He literally started drama, and then told his wife to try a bit of what would cause her to get sick anyways.", "And her husband is also a huge AH, for forcing her to disregard her own health to make other people happy. OP has admitted to having a people-pleasing problem and it sounds like they\u2019re taking advantage of that to get their own way, and make her feel bad for something she can\u2019t control. This probably isn\u2019t the first time either", "There are so many gluten free flours that are simply a 1:1 exchange for regular flour, and it\u2019s not that hard to swap dairy for non-dairy items. This was a jerk move. Maybe a bit of therapy to help with the standing up for yourself?", "They should be glad OP didn't end up in the hospital... wouldn't hesitate to file for divorce if it was me in her position.", "Almost every grocery store has GF cupcakes or an actual cake now. Hell Target has this delicious strawberries and creme one that I\u2019m addicted too. \n\nEven if you can\u2019t cook GF or you if your kitchen has too much gluten contact it\u2019s fine. There are other options.", "I\u2019m glad I could help! The 300-500 number are for cookies though, I couldn\u2019t imagine making that many cakes! My kitchen would quit on me.", "Yes. I have Celiac. I will absolutely not cross this boundary. My SM made a big deal to try to make me a roast I could eat last Christmas but despite my reminder she neglected to check the spices - sure enough they had gluten. I didn\u2019t eat it despite her efforts. Not worth my health. \n\nIf she has celiac she is slowly killing herself just so SIL doesn\u2019t feel bad. WTF. \n\nOP, STOP EATING IT!!!!", "Haven't tried tiger nuts but will keep an eye out for them! I'm okay with pistachios (seeds not nuts) and sunflower seeds so I use them a lot.", "I'm not sure", "Do you have a recommendation for an oat flour? I have a deathly nut allergy and my MIL has celiacs. I cook GF when she visits but would love to have more variety or be able to bake her Christmas cookies as well,  but every flour I've looked at is processed on the same equipment as nuts so I would be putting myself at risk", "I buy gluten free oats and throw them in a coffee grinder.", "Have used before, works well.", "NTA. It is not nice to make a cake for someone's birthday that will make them sick. In what world is that nice of her?", "NTA. I am disabled, but love making desserts for people when I can. No egg? No problem. No milk? Same as me then. No nuts? Also same as me, no problem. No flour? I can fix that. No sugar? No worries, there are other options. All of the above? No biggie, I can work some magic. \n\nIn no way would I ever force anyone to eat something that made them sick, no matter what. Your family is AH, you are not.", "I love how the expectation of your husband was to risk getting sick just \u201cto be nice\u201d to family. It was your birthday and you don\u2019t have to compromise yourself on this day, especially for your health. NTA", "NTA- I have celiacs if I have a typical dessert I\u2019d be in a world of hurt for at least a week. If it causes serious harm you should never just suck it up. Your husband is an ah for suggesting so.", "NTA, Your SIL did not do something nice for you, and If your husband doesn't see that then you have a husband problem.", "NTA, tell that part of you saying you may be TA to shut up. Would you ever tell someone else to be okay with being physically ill to protect someone's feelings? Not likely, because that's selfish. Do not be afraid to advocate for yourself. It's okay to say no thanks to SIL.", "YTA to yourself for eating food that mades you sick (on your own birthday!) to avoid hurting the feelings of inconsiderate people.\n\nYou need to stand up for yourself.", "NTA, your husband is an asshole for prioritizing his sister over you when your health is a concern. She's not giving you a gift if she's giving you poison.", "If it is your bd or not is irrelevant. You should ALWAYS get an option by de host of food you can eat without getting ill. Even if it is by choice. If they can't meet that, they should tell you so you can bring sth of your own for yourself.\n\nNow, specially because it is your bd, they should make an extra effort to accomodate you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your husband and SIL don\u2019t care about your health. Did you confront them after you fell sick ?", "NTA but your SIL and husband definitely are. She wanted the credit for doing a good deed until the deed proved more complicated than she expected.\n\nSorry you were put in that situation and hope you are feeling better.", "NTA and your husband is an ableist jerk for minimizing how one of your restrictions would make you feel. As someone with allergies and food sensitivities, I get it and he is the one who should apologize not you. BTW his actions are also abusive period.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to poison yourself for the convenience of others. NTA\n\nThese people don\u2019t really care about you and insisting you eat things that make you ill is abusive.", "It's your party and you should eat cake if you want to. NTA", "It's your party and you should eat cake if you want to. NTA", "It's your party and you should eat cake if you want to. NTA", "This 100 percent. And then for the husband to prioritize his sisters feelings over op(his wife\u2019s) health issues. I personally cancel the whole thing and go out with people who truly cared about me.", "Absolutely NTA! And OP, my mom is gluten intolerant and we ALWAYS do our best to make sure there is something she can eat if she\u2019s present, ESPECIALLY IF ITS HER OWN PARTY.", "This right here, like the sister-in-law was just making sure that the poison she gives her won't be lethal. Like that's so fucked up", "My hubby can tolerate some gluten but not a lot. So we always try to do gluten free for him, if I don\u2019t like the taste of texture then I take the extra time to make two meals. One for him and one for me, I don\u2019t mind as long as he can eat and not be sick. Our two year old son is a sour dough bread lover and thankfully has no issues with gluten like his dad for now.(I say that because I\u2019d feel horrible if he got sick because of my cooking) honestly I\u2019m amazed by how much gluten free stuff is showing up more and happy for it.

Completely 100% this!", "It sounds like your husband knows about your people pleasing which is why he's trying to endanger your health to satisfy others. Is your people pleasing going to get better if you're with someone who is directly trying to keep you in that position?", "My four year old son understands that I can't eat gluten. He's not always sure what gluten is, but if I tell him that a good has it in it he doesn't try to make me eat it. He also washes his hands and face it he eats something with gluten before kissing me. How can't adults understand this?!?!", "I make my sister gf tiramisu. For the easy way, you can order gf ladyfingers off of Amazon. But if you don't want to do this, I found this weird gf pie crust recipe that absolutely did not work as a pie crust. However I thought it would make good tea cookie/almost shortbread type cookies so I just kind of lay that out on a cookie sheet in pieces the size and shape of ladyfingers. They're harder and more dense than the really light airy ones but work just as well. You could even make kind of gf sugar cookies but shape them differently and use those. And with the Amazon gf ladyfingers, not one person knows it's gf.", "This right here, you need to examine your relationship and see how your husband is affecting your mental health. He's asking you to people please at the expense of your health, what else is he demanding of you?", "Lol!! It's still a lot of baking! I only make bread. I used to make bread every Sunday afternoon for the week, especially as a poor single mom. I still love making bread whenever I can.

Your husband and in-laws though\u2026 they all seem to have forgotten who your birthday party is about: YOU! You should never ever feel bad for wanting food you can eat at YOUR PARTY! And did your husband really encourage you to eat something that he knew would make you sick, just for the sake of \u201cbeing nice\u201d? Girl I am so sorry this happened to you, go out and buy yourself a cake YOU will enjoy and have a redo party with some friends, other family, people who actually care about you.", "Nta\n\nOp this is so messed up! You 100% do not eat something that you know will make you sick to appease anyone! \n\nAnd anyone who would ask you to, is a colossal A**, and they do not care much for you!", "Yikes that red flag age difference again. NTA. You have a husband problem. He's willing to let you get sick.", "WTF?!?\n\nThere are a lot of AHs but YOU are none of them.\n\nWas SIL trying to poison you? \nAnd your husband is a full on jerk for expecting you to suck it up and try it even though he must have known you'll.be getting sick. \n\nWow...\n\nNTA", "NTA. Not sure how anyone has the energy to bake a cake for someone and make it inedible for them. I mean they could have just.... not done anything and it would have been better and kinder to you (and made you feel better). It's so weird that it doesn't even seem like power play,  just still verry AH of them to do.", "NTA. Making someone a cake they can't eat is not \"doing something nice\" for them. It's doing it for show.", "Food is literally one of the few basic human requirements, and they got you thinking you're an asshole for wanting to eat on your own birthday without getting sick?\n\nNeither of them deserve you in their life. Your SIL didn't do anything kind *for you*. She was just showing off. NTA", "NTA", "Absoultely NTA. \nYou're worried about being a brat or an A hole and even took a bite of cake you knew would make you poorly.  I think you might be a co-dependent, because you're putting other people's needs before your own.  You're definitely NTA, but your husband is.
