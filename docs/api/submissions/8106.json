They spoiled Connie and didn\u2019t enforce boundaries. They outright encouraged her to misbehave because they thought it was cute/funny for her to throw tantrums or show people the finger.\n\nMy parents have continued to enable Connie well into adulthood. They allowed Connie to drop out of high school because she wanted to get a GED and enter college early. Connie never actually got a GED or returned to school. She still lives with my parents and refuses to get a job.\n\nMy parents will try to nag Connie to earn her GED or get a job, but she just won\u2019t and there\u2019s no real consequence if she refuses anyway. If Connie wants something and my parents refuse, she\u2019ll scream her head off like a child until our parents give in. My mom is in her late sixties and my dad just turned seventy. They claim they just don\u2019t have the energy to deal with Connie.\n\nMy parents had a grandparent day with my children and took them to the mall. They brought my children back to my house, stayed for dinner, and then asked to talk with me privately. They explained that they can\u2019t deal with Connie\u2019s behavior anymore and wanted Connie to move in with me and my family so that I could essentially become Connie\u2019s disciplinarian and re-raise her to be a proper adult.\n\nI told my parents no. I have three actual children and don\u2019t have time to parent a 28-year-old toddler. Nor do I want Connie\u2019s tantrums and screaming in my house. My mom tried to make the excuse that I need to step in because she and my father just don\u2019t have the energy to deal with Connie.\n\nI was frank with my parents that Connie\u2019s behavior is their own fault and now is their problem. They weren\u2019t always in their late sixties. They had years to step up and stop enabling Connie. I\u2019m certain there\u2019s some boot camp or other program that exists to get adults like Connie to grow up. But that\u2019s their responsibility to arrange and look into.\n\nSome family members have reached out to tell me that I was being selfish and childish because my mom and dad were both great parents to me and now it\u2019s supposed to be my turn to support them. Most of these family members understand why I don\u2019t want Connie\u2019s tantrums and fits around my kids, but said that I should still help my parents look into other options. I don\u2019t deny that my mom and dad were great parents to me but it\u2019s still not my responsibility to be a parent to my adult sister.

Raising an entitled and lazy menace and then wanting to pawn them off on their other adult child to deal with, raise, and to fix.\n\n\nThey don't want to take accountability for what they did, they don't want to literally make her upset.  However they are fine with your 3 kids having to deal with her behavior.  You know young kids are impressionable and will likely learn to behave like she does.

You might consider investing a little time and effort into helping to change her trajectory. Why? Enlightened self-interested.
