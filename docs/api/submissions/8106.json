They spoiled Connie and didn\u2019t enforce boundaries. They outright encouraged her to misbehave because they thought it was cute/funny for her to throw tantrums or show people the finger.\n\nMy parents have continued to enable Connie well into adulthood. They allowed Connie to drop out of high school because she wanted to get a GED and enter college early. Connie never actually got a GED or returned to school. She still lives with my parents and refuses to get a job.\n\nMy parents will try to nag Connie to earn her GED or get a job, but she just won\u2019t and there\u2019s no real consequence if she refuses anyway. If Connie wants something and my parents refuse, she\u2019ll scream her head off like a child until our parents give in. My mom is in her late sixties and my dad just turned seventy. They claim they just don\u2019t have the energy to deal with Connie.\n\nMy parents had a grandparent day with my children and took them to the mall. They brought my children back to my house, stayed for dinner, and then asked to talk with me privately. They explained that they can\u2019t deal with Connie\u2019s behavior anymore and wanted Connie to move in with me and my family so that I could essentially become Connie\u2019s disciplinarian and re-raise her to be a proper adult.\n\nI told my parents no. I have three actual children and don\u2019t have time to parent a 28-year-old toddler. Nor do I want Connie\u2019s tantrums and screaming in my house. My mom tried to make the excuse that I need to step in because she and my father just don\u2019t have the energy to deal with Connie.\n\nI was frank with my parents that Connie\u2019s behavior is their own fault and now is their problem. They weren\u2019t always in their late sixties. They had years to step up and stop enabling Connie. I\u2019m certain there\u2019s some boot camp or other program that exists to get adults like Connie to grow up. But that\u2019s their responsibility to arrange and look into.\n\nSome family members have reached out to tell me that I was being selfish and childish because my mom and dad were both great parents to me and now it\u2019s supposed to be my turn to support them. Most of these family members understand why I don\u2019t want Connie\u2019s tantrums and fits around my kids, but said that I should still help my parents look into other options. I don\u2019t deny that my mom and dad were great parents to me but it\u2019s still not my responsibility to be a parent to my adult sister.

Raising an entitled and lazy menace and then wanting to pawn them off on their other adult child to deal with, raise, and to fix.\n\n\nThey don't want to take accountability for what they did, they don't want to literally make her upset.  However they are fine with your 3 kids having to deal with her behavior.  You know young kids are impressionable and will likely learn to behave like she does.

If she can go air force, get a personnel job or something like that, she'll have it easy af.\n\nOh yeah, NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut unless there's a developmental issue here someone needs to have a serious discussion with Connie and ask her what she intends to do when her parents aren't around to cater to her anymore. OP you need to tell her in no uncertain terms she will never be welcome to live in your home under any circumstances. \n\nMaybe your parents should downsize their home.", "NTA but, geez. I get your parents not raising her right, but uh. Is something wrong with Connie? I've seen so many people with undiagnosed, debilitating neurological disorders that I have to ask. Most people would have the motivation and skills to launch, with the right support.", "NTA. But maybe I can provide my experience?\n\nWhen I was born, my parents died, and I went to live with my grandma. I had my troubles in school. Eventually I was diagnosed with mental illness and dropped out.\n\nI got my GED and tried for several years to graduate from 2 year college, to no avail. \n\nI was spoiled too, in some ways. In other ways, I feel I was neglected. Either because my grandma didn't have the time, or didn't want me to be bothered, I never learned the most important thing: how to take care of myself. \n\nSo, at nearly the same age as your sister, I'm having to catch up FAST. Now that my grandma is sick, and people are talking about selling our house after she passes, and who I'm going to live with, I'm scared. I need my independence so the people making decisions about my life don't pass me around like an old fruitcake. Or worse, before I end up homeless.\n\nSo, I'm learning to cook, and clean, how to budget, and how to travel place to place on my own. How to grocery shop, and shop for home essentials,  etc, learning one skill a week.  It's a lot but I'm highly motivated. \n\nWhich I guess brings me to my point. Connie is a grown woman. If she wants to change, that has to come from her. And I don't think anyone likes to be talked about like they're an object, to be decided what to do with. \n\nInstead of a camp, how about a therapist? They would be able to help Connie set her own goals, and start moving towards them.", "Nta tell those relatives to take her in. Don\u2019t even let your kids near Connie. They might learn her bad behaviors", "I would laughed and then kicked out your parents for their audacity. And your other relatives: tell them to parent those 28year old toddler.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Don't even think about letting her move in.  Don't get involved.  Keep your distance.  Don't help, or else you will be slowly pulled in until she becomes your dependant.   She can be on her own if it has to come to that.", "NTA. This is your parents nightmare. They need to clean it up", "NTA. She's an adult and won't listen to you even in your house. It's just going to add chaos to your home. \n\nGood luck forcing an adult into a boot camp and making her stay there. You legally can't. \n\nThe only thing that will help is if your parents kick her out. Period. There's no hope for her in any other situation. Damage has been done.", "Even if you had no kids and won the lottery so you have no financial or other obligations and just slobbing all day at your home, you're not responsible for this 28 year old grown-ass freeloader.", "NTA, she's 28, it's beyond ridiculous, and if she doesn't want to they can't force her to stay in a bootcamp anyway.\n\nThey simply need to tell her she's moving out, if she refuses they need to take the appropriate steps to kick her out.", "\u201cHey you know your terrible and useless sister?  We don\u2019t want her in our house anymore because she\u2019s just a nightmare.  Can she live with you?\u201d\n\nWTF.

But they do want YOU to bear all the consequences of both because they can't be arsed.\n\nI know someone just like Connie. Except she's now almost 60, still living with mom, still not working, and living off mom's meagre pension. If Connie doesn't get cut off and the safety net completely taken away, she will never change.

Same age as well. He went to school and finished but is legitimately a child. Ended up kicking him out because it was just insane. Wasn't able to act like an adult at all. Currently lives with his parents", "nTa", "Actually, her parents have no cojones. That's the problem.", "Will Connie go? She's a legal adult, no one can force her to attend if she doesn't want to.\n\nI think it certainly sounds like she needs intervention, but the sad thing about raising a kid who fails to launch is that once they're old enough that the permanence of the situation is clear, they're usually to old to be forced to change their ways unless they want to.", "100%\n\nThough I\u2019m skeptical about a boot camp for failed to launch adults. Their failure to parent will still be a problem when your sister returns from any kind of external environment \u2014 there is no free lunch. The first thing that they need is a good psychologist (for themselves to relearn how to parent and hold their hands along the bumpy path they are going to embark on).", "I don't think that bootcamp for adults will work, as she doesn't have to stay there if she doesn't want to. You have no legal power to keep her there. It'd be better for your parents to give her an ultimatum to find a job (maybe part-time in the beginning) or move out. They need to stop enabling her.", "At 28, she's really not your parents' responsibility anymore either.", "I\u2019d heavily push for the military. It\u2019ll set her straight and set her up for the rest of her life if she learns to play her cards right. But yeah, not your problem by any means.", "To be honest.. at 28 Connie is not your parents responsibility. Nor is she yours. She is her own responsibility. It is sad your parents did not raise her right and she is unable to be an adult. At 28 she should be able to have her own house and work.\n\nETA: NTA.", "I can't imagine how an \"adult boot camp\" is really supposed to work for someone who doesn't want to grow up.  If she's 28, your parents/aunt can't legally force her to go or stay, so it would have no power over her.  And if she wanted to grow up and stop being an adult toddler, presumably it wouldn't have gotten to this point.\n\nAre they trying to apply some kind of threat/leverage, like \"Go to this or you have to move out?\"", "your aunt-in-law is older and therefore more experienced as a parent. good on you for recognizing the parent-child boundary correctly! apples and oranges \ud83d\ude02", "It makes me laugh about the comment of you bring childish. Hmm bringing a disruptive very bad example of an adult to follow for your own kids is clearly being a very immature person. /S\n\nNTA OP you need to do what's right for your own kids.

She's not your responsibility. She's really responsible for herself as this age. They're still babying her by trying to force her on someone else instead of just making her try to make it on her own as an adult without a GED. (which she can still pursue, if she finds that she needs it) Their lack of boundaries isn't on you.", "If they'd found the energy to start dealing with it 25 years ago, they would have spent way less energy over the long term dealing with Connie's bullshit because there would have been significantly less bullshit.", "Take my poor man's gold for this \ud83c\udfc5 The girl hasn't graduated *high school.* She can function about as well as a 15-year old, maybe.

The former friend also a tantrum thrower.

The answer for most children is that when they become teenagers they naturally want to separate from their parents and forge their own identities. Also throwing tantrums is not a sign of normal psychological development after the early elementary years and even that\u2019s a stretch.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s worked with developmentally disabled adults in the past I  can\u2019t help but wonder if she needs some sort of psychological help or if she\u2019s cognitively delayed. Perhaps getting a psychological or \u201cneuropsychological\u201d evaluation would help. A psychologist can run cognitive testing and suggest whether she\u2019s delayed or has a social disability or something else.\n\nIf it\u2019s truly just selfishness and low work ethic, then getting out of the house and having to work should give her the motivation she needs, but if she lacks cognitive skills to figure out adult life she might need professional help.", "Just want to add.. a suggestion. Not a great thing to do but when Connie has a screaming fit record her with your phone and play it back for her. \nIt could give her actual insight into how she behaves. \n\nI'm also petty so I'd tell your parents to play it whenever she gets huffy or starts trouble. If she wants to act like a child she can see the mirror image of herself to where she becomes embarrassed or sick the screaming to where she may stop it all together", "This is really weird.  Is there something wrong with Connie?  I.e. are you sure she's not on the spectrum and never was taught how to deal with it?  Still NTA, but there's something missing here.", "Yeah - let's not take unfair advantage of people's kindness.", "NTA. You have your own children (who are actually children) and they are your primary responsibility. Your parents seem to understand the basics of parenting and they raised you to be an independent adult. Therefore they had the skills to raise Connie to become a functioning adult but for whatever reason *they didn't*. That is neither your fault nor your responsibility. By trying to handball Connie to you, your parents are reinforcing the narrative that Connie isn't responsible for anything and that someone else has to 'parent' her. Unless she has a diagnosis or medical condition there is no reason for a nearly 30 year old to behave like a toddler. Your parents made this mess, they have to fix it.", "[removed]", "She would turn that house into a state of constant chaos.

So tried living their lives this time instead of raising a kid again.", "True, but since she's an adult, there's no way they can force her to see a doctor/therapist.", "This exactly, like... screaming tantrums are not normal for a 28yo unless there is a neurological issue involved. The haze of sibling resentment, been there, might just be covering up a salient reason to explain a 28yo failing to launch this hard.
