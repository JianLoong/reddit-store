This one hit home. I have a similar relationship with my sister, I went NC to get away from her abuse and toxicity. I recognize that it is more difficult for moms to do this so I don\u2019t expect her to follow the same path, even though my sister treats her like crap. But I do expect her to respect the boundaries I have set with her and limit cross-over. I constantly have to remind mom of this and what it means, and I suspect you will too. I would suggest sitting mom down for a heart to heart and let her know that the more she tries to push you on this in these subtle, passive-aggressive ways, the lower your contact will go with her. You respect that mom has a relationship with sis and dad but in order to continue a relationship with you there can\u2019t be overlap. And you need to enforce that too.

Unconditional love and all that lol. And the whole bit about no overlap, this is very hard for them to do, we are asking them for an impossible balancing act. I have to check myself constantly before getting angry with her for things I wanted in the first place (like not telling me she\u2019s going over to sis\u2019s house for dinner or something - she has every right to do this and I told her not to involve me so why am I mad?! Lol). It was easier once I had an open discussion with her and we set up some \u2018ground rules\u2019. Still tough but they help. Seriously, good for you for making the choice that is best for you and good luck (in a non-sarcastic way!)."]}
