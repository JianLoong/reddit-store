Ever since I was 14 I realised that my dad never raised me. I would only see my mum at important events like art contests and award ceremonies. She would be the one to drive me to my first job, to and from school, and let me live by doing things my dad wouldn't let me like going out with friends and going to concerts.\n\nI live in an ethnic household, my dad was raised overseas and has the traditional expectations of a woman and a man. This lead him to never let me get a bike because it was for 'boys'. Be home before dark. Only tell me I'm pretty when I wear a dress and makeup. And always comments on my weight, which makes me uncomfortable since I feel like I barely know him.\n\nNow that I'm older, I'm a lot more independent, making my own money and taking myself to my own appointments etc. I never spoke much to my father when I was younger because a lot of our talks would be met with 'I'm right, you're wrong. Listen to me, go away.' type of talk. So I stay away from him and never ask for money from him because I want to try and disassociate from him as much as I can. Days go by where I only say hi to him when I come home from work or university.

When he would force me into a hug, I would turn my head to my mother and roll my eyes. My mother (F45) and I have a run-on joke about my dad thinking he raised me when really my mother did all the 'raising'. My sister thinks I'm a horrible daughter for being blunt around my dad but also gets upset when he does the same stuff to her that he does to me. She, however always asks for money from him and actively talks to him more than I do.\n\nI respect my dad but I don't love him. He gave me a home, food and electricity. It was all physical love, the type he was brought up to believe was the role of a father. But he never said 'He loved me' unless I was doing the dishes or cleaning the house. He never took me to places I wanted to go. Always yelled at me for small things. He was never an emotional parent and never gave me the comfort of being there for me.

Your feelings don't need validation.  You feel because of the circumstance of your childhood.  It's good that you are grateful for what his actual contribution to your life was ... food, shelter, most of the tangible necessities.  Too bad that he was unable to give the intangibles ... love, affection, attention.  You can never forget what he did, nor didn't do, but maybe someday you will get the maturity to forgive him for his failures.  Just my thoughts offered for your consideration.  I hope that your decisions about this and all other life's choices lead to greater happiness.", "NTA\n\nThat said, your father is but a fallible human being with which you hold up to seemingly idealistic standards that, in my opinion, are unreasonable \n\nMy father was very much like this. I was bitter around your age too. But as I got older, I came to realize at the end of the day, he really did care but like all imperfect people, made mistakes. But he did the best he could. At the time I didn\u2019t really realize or care about that, but at the end of the day, that\u2019s all anyone can expect from someone. That\u2019s the absolute best any of us are doing at any time. So how could I judge someone else for what I myself was also doing? (Trying my best yet falling short of idealist expectation)\n\nWith parenting especially, it\u2019s not too often parents end up polar opposites of how they were parented. If he himself was not emotionally fostered when growing up, that especially underscores an element of forgiveness\n\nGrowing up, all my father knew was survival. Nobody asked him how he was doing and nobody cared. Yet, he did everything he could knowing what he did, which was that survival is everything, and emotions come later (or never.) so his idea of being a good parent was providing the tangibles, which he did, and I\u2019m very grateful because many don\u2019t get to say that \n\nPerhaps one day you\u2019ll grow up and find that the things that make you feel resentful now, were actually perhaps his only way of knowing how to say \u201cI love you\u201d at the time \n\nI\u2019m 36 now and my father is one of my best friends. I\u2019m very glad we got closer as I got older and understood his perspective more. I would have deeply held an immense amount of regret if I let him pass without ever really having tried to understand his side \n\nYMMV", "You may be expecting more from him than he has to offer. My dad was one of the last generation who got the full-bore pre-war 'stiff-upper-lip' English upbringing, and while he had a lot of good qualities, he was emotionally stunted his whole life because of it. The last time I saw him he was dropping me off at the train station after a visit, and I hugged him good by. It was like hugging a board. He never could have been the father I needed. It wasn't in him. I daresay it isn't in your father, either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your father was not really a parent, he sounds more like a stranger that unfortunately has authority over you. I would do the same thing tbh and not even accept his hugs. Good for you for realizing this was not normal. NTA.", "I don't want to issue a judgment, but I do have some insight into this. My father was a lot like yours.... less authoritarian, maybe, but just as emotionally absent. I was about your age when he died. He died right after my sister did, so it took me a long time to parse out my feelings about our relationship, and what losing him actually meant to me. I can't say I really mourn my dad. I didn't really know him, even though we lived in the same house. I'm fifty now, and mostly I feel sad that I don't know where he came from or who he really was. I don't know his family, what his childhood was like, what funny or outrageous things he saw or did, the traumas he faced, or how he felt about things beyond the typical political and societal views a white Southern man born in 1932 would have. \n\nI don't know if you're familiar with \"This Be The Verse\" by Philip Larkin, but I spent years - decades - viewing my relationship with my dad with that idea in mind. But now that I'm older, I realize things could have been different. You were, like I was, once a child your father wounded deeply, but now you're an adult in your own right. You can choose to take the lead, and change the course of your relationship. You may be able to find out who he is, and maybe guide him to a more loving relationship with you. You may have that in your power. But only if you want to - and whether you want to or not is just a choice about what is best for you, not about what is right or wrong. But, either way, know that the possibility won't be there forever.", "Thank you, I feel when I mature more or live life more I will see things from a new perspective maybe.", "Our fathers are very similar in their upbringing so I think you\u2019re accurate with what\u2019s in my father.", "The tragedy is, a lot of these guys *feel* just as much as everybody else; they just have no idea how and no ability to express it. My dad was a botanist and a gardener, and loved animals. He could show love to plants, he could express it to the dogs, but never to his son.", "NTA your father sounds like he came from a generation similar to mines where they believe only giving you the means to survive but no emotionally support/affection is what dictates a parent. \n\nYour father is at this point where he\u2019s unlikely to ever change or realize his flaws. Accept that he\u2019s just mentally limited. Love is earned and unfortunately for him he has not done his part to earn it.", "NAH. Your father possibly grew up in a household where men are deemed \"less manly\" or \"not man enough\" if they show emotions and would get berated, beaten, or ridiculed if they even shed a single tear or show a sliver of affection. I understand both you and him because the same thing happened with my dad and I.\n\nHowever, I never gave up in wanting to have a relationship with my dad despite me being independent now. And so, little by little, he's finally opening up to me in my 20s and him in his 40s. But, like you, I also went through the same experience in hating him because he never showed me affection. But then I realized how toxic my grandparents treat him even now, to the point where they would verbally abuse him in front of the entire family and no one even cared enough to speak up for him.\n\nIn the end, it's your choice whether you still want a relationship with him or not.", "NTA sounds like your sister is annoyed that you're exhibiting self-respect/boundaries that she never did.", "OP please do yourself a favor.  Find a way to move out as soon as possible.  Then you can finally go NC with this asshole that was supposed to be a father to you.\n\nNTA", "One thing I've realized as I've gotten older is that our parents are often working against their own upbringings and the bad stuff they learned as kids. I acknowledge that my parents loved me, and did the best they could. But they also screwed up in some pretty significant ways. Like you, I try to appreciate the good things they've done. It's possible to do that but still keep the distance you need for your own mental health. You're only responsible for your own choices and outlook.", "You are NTA, but you are a bit of a putz for respecting him at all. Merely existing does not mean one is entitled to respect, conservative thought holders least of all.", "NTA.  You have a father.  Unfortunately you do not have a dad.  A very distinct difference.  Hopefully he will realize this as well and try to do better (not that he can make up for your childhood but maybe have a better relationship with you and your sister).  Best of luck."]}
