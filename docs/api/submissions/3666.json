She had a fairly large collection of jewellery that is made from various precious metals and gems, it is all very valuable. \n\nBefore her passing, my mother and I talked a lot about what her wishes would be, and she told me she wants the jewellery passed from generation to generation for the women in the family.\n\nMy brother [m40s] has three daughters, [f20], [f15] and [f11]. I discussed it with my brother and I mentioned that I intend to gift my eldest niece some of her grandmother's jewellery.\n\nMy brother asked about me giving some of the jewellery to the other two daughters. \n\nI said I will when they're both 18 and done with high school. I think kids their age usually aren't mature enough to understand the importance of the heirlooms or to take good care of them. When I was a teenager lots of girls at my school would bring family jewellery to school and it would be stolen.\n\nMy brother said I'm being unfair to my nieces and that if I'm going to give jewellery to the eldest, all of them should receive jewellery straight away or they'll feel left out. He said that I'm not the one who will have to deal with the younger two being sad. \n\nHe suggested I just gift all of them the jewellery now. I don't think this is reasonable, kids of different ages get treated differently in certain situations because that's what's appropriate. He thinks I'm being harsh on the younger two and being selfish.\n\nSo, would it make me the jerk to just gift my eldest niece some of the jewellery, leaving out the younger two, against my brother's wishes? \n\nThere isn't much my brother could do about it if I did, my eldest niece is financially independent and lives with her fianc\u00e9.\n\nEdit to add: for those asking why I don't wait until the youngest is 18, I want to gift my niece some of the jewellery before she gets married next year.

Second, you're NTA. The two younger girls are absolutely at an age where they can understand that sometimes one person gets a gift and the others won't.

That way they don't feel left out. Plus, hopefully, they should understand why you would want to hang onto actual precious stone jewelry until they're 18.", "NTA. \n\nRe: feeling left out \n\nControl the narrative. \n\nI would let the girls know if there are specific pieces for them. Show them to them and let them wear it once in a special occasion at your private house, e.g. a memorial lunch for grandma. \n\nThen, they take them off. You show them how you\u2019re going to be taking care of it and keeping it safe for them by putting it into a safe or bank security box. \n\nThis helps them learn that the items are precious and how to best secure them. \n\nYou can present the three of them with similar matching less expensive jewelry. The younger girls will have something to wear. It\u2019s a new set of special jewelry commemorating the relationship between the women of your family, the nieces, you, and the grandma. \n\nI would get a backup of each necklace to gift the girls if they lose it, after they have a stable adult living situation with lower risk of theft or loss. \n\n\n\nRe: wedding:\n\nI recommend lending the items out to the eldest for her wedding but holding onto it for her until she has a living situation in which theft isn\u2019t a concern. You also want to gauge her responsibility regardless of her age. You know your family best. \n\nIt is extremely easy for folks to lose wedding jewelry and other heirlooms during the wedding. Offer to help transport it and keep it safe when she takes it off. It is super easy to accidentally leave it by the sink or let it fall in a hotel toilet. \n\nIt\u2019s why I really really recommend using replicas or cheaper items for weddings. You cannot replace some things. If it\u2019s her something borrowed, awesome. She can give them to you for safe keeping after the reception.\n\nMy advice is to wait until the youngest is 18 because even if you give the jewelry to the eldest niece, he could still let the younger nieces wear it. \n\nI like accessories and tried to take care of them. I lost so much costume jewelry as a kid even while being careful. 11 and 15 are not great ages for that. \n\nPlus, let\u2019s say they take the necklace off for PE and someone steals it. That would suck. \n\nHonestly \u2014 I would wait until they\u2019re settled in situations where the jewelry is less likely to get stolen. So for instance, not living with random Craigslist roomies.

It had been in my family for over 150 years, and I was the only grandchild that had actually lived on it\u2014the others were raised out of state.  She chose me because since it had been my home, she believed that I would do my best to keep it in the family.  It is on a coast and quite valuable.  The mistake was that she knew nothing about trusts and my father convinced her to leave it to him, with the verbal promise that he would bequeath it to me.  This agreement happened in a family meeting, and all of my aunts and uncles were present and agreed.  Fast forward many years, and my father has remarried and is diagnosed with esophageal cancer.  He never made a will.  The moment the chemo started affecting his mind, my step-siblings tried to take everything.  I got nothing except for my grandmother\u2019s land, and I was only able to save that due to a quirk in Texas\u2019 law that they did not know about.  \n\nMy point is that the minute you turn over that jewelry to minor children, you have no control over what happens to it.

Discuss it again with your brother, so you are both on the same page.", "NTA but kinda sounds like your brother is gonna sell the younger ones jewelry as soon as he gets it cos l don\u2019t see his side at all. Otherwise, you could always gift it to her for Christmas or a birthday if it\u2019s such a big deal.", "All of this. For another perspective, I was gifted one of my great aunt's rings when I was a child. I lost it very quickly and am now devastated by that. Wait until they are older.", "Agree, but an 11 year old is going to pick something she will hate when she's 18. Let them look and tell them their choice will come when they are 18", "The OP should choose the pieces and just try to make it even.\n\nLetting the girls choose may cause a fight, and also, the two younger kids' taste in jewelry may change by the time they turn 18.", "I mean, right or wrong, they are his kids.  I think you should defer to how they'd prefer to parent, even if you don't personally like it.", "No, I'd likely say don't buy a PS5 for only one of my kids, especially if its going to be in the same house with the other 2.", "Why does this sound so familiar\u2026.oh yeah\u2026.i lived this \ud83d\ude2d", "just because its his kids doesnt mean everything he says is correct. if that was the case then CPS wouldnt be a thing", "so then dont give kids anything because to protect others from learning that they cant get everything in life? are you a teacher at an elementary school by chance?", "NTA and it sounds to me like the younger children rule the roost in the house. They don\u2019t ever get told \u2018no\u2019, do they? I feel sorry for the oldest, because she probably never gets anything special.", ">my mother left all of her jewellery to me.\n\n**NTA**. cut, print, we're done here", "NTA. But, I suggest you contact your nieces and let know that you have special items from grandma that will gifted to them on their eighteenth birthdays.", "The jewelry was left to you and it is your decision who you wish to share with and at what age the sharing will happen. I personally would make the marker a college graduation or a wedding. You are very generous to want to share and to recognize that your nieces loved their grandma's jewelry too. Also, if the jewelry is that valuable the brother could sell it if it was given to minor children.", "Too young she will lose it", "For others reading this, get a trust/will and set it all out before, and be specific. A relative w/o kids did this, and I'm the executor, so I won't have to deal with this b/c the trust spells out specifically who gets what, even down to which rug goes to which person.", "NTA. 18 is more than acceptable to wait for the heirlooms. Your brother shouldn't have a say in your decision.", "18 might still be a bit young.  How about 21 or when you get married, whichever comes first.", "NTA. Give it to the first niece as a gift for graduating high school and do the same with the other 2 when they graduate too in the next few years. Your brother is TA because that jewelry is now yours and he\u2019s telling what he thinks you need to do with your stuff. I don\u2019t know why this reminded me of the mom who had a trophy made for her snowflake daughter because her painting was better but she didn\u2019t make it into the top 3 in the competition. The younger nieces are too young and they can wait, no one will be traumatized.", "NTA.", "I got a gold and diamond ring from a family friend who was like a are to my mother.  It was given to m on my 9th birthday.  I took very good care of it and passed it on to my niece for her high school graduation.  I do not know if she took care of it.  I was given a women's gold pocket watch that my grandfather had engraved for his only daughter in 1888.  I got it in 7th grade.  It was still working when I gave it to another niece for her college graduation.  She had the same name as my great aunt.  Point is, some people take care of jewelry, other do not.  Tell the younger nieces that they will be gifted some jewelry when they hit significant milestones , like high school graduation, or when they turn 21.  Your property, your choice.  kt", "NTA.", "NTA, and you're exactly right. The younger ones won't be sad unless your brother tells them they should be. If they're raised to believe expensive jewelry is for adults, it will be natural to them that they wait. If there's trouble here, it will be because brother is stirring the pot.", "Why is it necessary that the girls choose mine? I foresee years of unpleasantness and backbiting as individuals change their minds. Why don't you hold on to it and divide it fairly yourself, so the sisters don't get into fights over it.", "NTA OP. I was going to say this as well. When I was a child my great aunt brought back jewelry from her travels for me and her other nieces. When we each graduated she gave each of us a ring. I was the eldest and received mine first. Two years later another sister received hers, then my youngest sister another two years later. \n\nNo big deal. We understood there was jewelry and saw it when we were young, but there was a a milestone before receiving the gift.", "To add to this, I received my great grandma's engagement ring (which has a fabulous story about being lost on the prairies of Canada after slipping down a drain on the train my great grandparents lived on.) I knew about the ring for years because it was part of my mom's collection, but I was only given it after I graduated university. Not because I graduated but because I had finally reached an age where she felt I would properly appreciate the history .", "That's an excellent point about pawning, and can easily be a sensible discussion ahead of giving.\n\nMy Dad had this happen, he didn't get any of his Mum's jewllery when she passed (because Tradition), but when his sister wanted to sell off an heirloom he bought it from her and gave it to my Mum (they were already married, I was nearly 2). He's big on Family, really bought it more because he didn't want a stranger to have the ring than anything else, but it's still a nice ring and Mum still wears it sometimes).", "op has clearly said that it is only inherited among women. why wasn't the brother offered anything. i think the jewelry has 1. an emotional value that needs to be balanced. 2. a monetary value that needs to be balanced.", "Its people's inheritance plus the brother didn't contest it. Plus in the end he wants the daughters to have the jewelry, which they will all get when they are at an age where they cant get it stolen. School kids can be very evil", "That was you. Did you wear it to school? Kids will want to show that stuff off, so one day it goes to school and never comes home again. Maybe you were the exception, but since teenagers do not routinely wear expensive jewelry, you wouldn't be missing it if it was kept for you to receive later.", "I'll try to describe it with an example. If parents were to bequeath the family home to the eldest boy without offering the other children something of equal emotional as well as monetary value, that would be favoritism. especially if there is an older daughter. For me it's just sexism when a gender is excluded and an age order is observed. what can someone be born as a 2nd or as a girl for that.", "that's not my point. I said the 18+ rule is good. I just said that I find it sexist that only women can inherit the jewelry as described in the post.", "I understand the purpose of CPS.  But this isn't a case of abuse.  Lets not decide that parents can't even dictate how others interact with their children", "I mean, in the case of something like that, absolutely.  I think its fair to ask other people from outside your home to not only buy some big gift for only 1 kid that you know all the kids will want.  Because then he'll have to deal with all the whining, etc. \n\nThis isn't some necessity.", "Sorry, but i think thats information not really relevant to the situation or else that would be the focus", "Parents can say what they want, but its ops jewelry and the eldest is already an adult so the dad cant say shiz", "I mean, its a simple rule of life, people get things others dont, like there are subs of people trying to spoil their kids so they dont whine", "Shouldn't I point this out to op? You say there would be no problem because then you would just give the boy some of the jewellery. Which is purely fictional. It is clear in the post that it should only be inherited by women. so you think gender preference is ok?", "Yes, I understand that.  She can do what she likes.  But if you value the relationship with the parent, you will take their wishes into account.  This isn't a question of legality or ability to do so", "I understand that.   That doesn't mean the dad shouldn't do his best to keep the peace in his house.  There are a lot of hard lessons kids should learn, but I also think its fair for the parents to decide the best way to teach them those lessons.", "NTA. You're the only one who gets to decide what to do with your belongings, especially ones as important as your mom's jewelry! It's not selfish to want to keep it safe. I'd say you could get jewelry to give them that isn't from your mom's collection but I don't think your brother would be happy with that", "NTA. Girls will understand.", "NTA\n\nYou can let the girls know, all of them, that they will receive pieces of their grandmother's jewelry for them to wear at their weddings. That way each of the girls knows they're getting something. Now if one or more choose not to get married in the future then you can set a specific age that they can receive the jewelry. \n\nLike one commenter said you can even let them choose jewelry that they like personally. I would have them choose one piece or if it's a set then one set and you put each in an individual box with their name on it and set it aside for each of them. And if you wish to give them more jewelry at that point then the choices are yours.\n\n I would suggest though if you're going to do this to allow the girls to do it one at a time so that there isn't a fight if all of them like the same pieces or two of them like the same set or whatever or if they do then take that piece of jewelry out of contention so that it belongs to nobody, or if it's a set split the set between them whoever gets what be your choice as the tie breaker. And then you can even save some extra pieces for each of their daughters as they have them so that not all the jewelry is given out at once.", "You could still gift them all the pieces you wish at the same time. Just have them over, show them what they will be getting and let them know it\u2019ll be in safe keeping until the age of whenever you feel is reasonable.", "Someone stole my phone the one singular time I forgot my gym lock and the skeezy feeling of knowing someone went through your stuff and took your things is just the fucking worst.", "Honestly the brother probably doesn\u2019t know how easily delicate jewelry can get broken because he\u2019s a guy. I had to wait for heirloom jewelry too and I\u2019m so glad I had to wait because the few things I did get as a kid I destroyed accidentally and now I\u2019m so upset with myself as an adult.", "yes, this.", "My dad gave my sister and I small diamond earrings when we turned 16. I still have them and wear them now at 26.", "NTA.  Your mother left you in charge.  Follow your own judgment.  Certainly you can have a talk with the younger nieces and tell them that you intend to gift them pieces when they are older.  Personally, I wouldn't put a specific age in my promise as people mature at different ages.  One might be responsible at 18 but another still not ready at that age.", "NTA. I seriously question why your brother wants the jewelry in his family before the children turn 18. So he can hock it? Very suspicious.", "NTA.\n\nJust tell them they too will be gifted jewelry before their weddings. Personally I wouldn't at 18, but it's your choice. No one else's.", "NTA. You're not excluding the other girls, you're just setting an age when you will give it to them. It is no different than if your mom had set up trusts that they can only access at certain ages. Just let the girls know they will get their jewelry when they turn 18 or whatever other milestone you want.", "NTA. Simply tell all three girls they\u2019ll all receive some of their grandmother\u2019s jewelry after they turn 18. That way your can gift the pieces you want to to the eldest (and as you said she\u2019s an adult so your brother can\u2019t really do anything) now and the youngest two know they\u2019ll get something special later on.", "I thought the same. \n\nOP NTA but perhaps you should create an actual trust or legal equivalent for your nieces and future heirs for this valuable jewelry and make sure to include a clause or something that explicitly spells out that that they can\u2019t give it away/sell it (needs to be returned back to the trust?) \n\nI am admittedly ignorant as to the best way to go about this legally but it might make sense to put some restrictions (age one would need to be to receive the jewelry, keeping pieces in the direct family descendants etc.)", "heres the thing, if its not a smart decision then its best to ignore the parent asking for the ridiculous request", "you do realize keeping the peace is enabling assholes right? why would the victims be forced to cater the aggressors. also, this is literally the perfect example to teach the girls that they will all get their fair share when the time comes. not once in the story are the girls feelings actually being considered. this is all the brother in law assuming since hes a bad parent that rather have his daughters be set up for failure in life if it means he can stride on by", "NTA.", "NTA but I'd make the age 20. A lot if 18 yr olds are still in high school. And when they first move out and get desperate for  money I can see them using the jewelry. So I'd also let them know you'll always be there to \"buy it back\" from them if they want to sell it.", "NTA but I would make sure that they get the same items. Like necklace, ring. Apparently in my grandma will the female grand kid will get 2 items of jewellery. My uncle is pissed and is saying it\u2019s not fair on his daughter. Due to the fact my mum has 4 girls. Also my grandma never really wore any jewellery.", "I remember having to wait until I was 13 to get my ears pierced. All of us were told that was the rule. But to make it \"fair\" my sisters got theirs since a few months later in their birthdays... 9 and 11. They were able to take care of the piercings but that wasn't the point for me. I'm still upset that rules only applied to me for much of my childhood."]}
