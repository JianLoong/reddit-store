She had a fairly large collection of jewellery that is made from various precious metals and gems, it is all very valuable. \n\nBefore her passing, my mother and I talked a lot about what her wishes would be, and she told me she wants the jewellery passed from generation to generation for the women in the family.\n\nMy brother [m40s] has three daughters, [f20], [f15] and [f11]. I discussed it with my brother and I mentioned that I intend to gift my eldest niece some of her grandmother's jewellery.\n\nMy brother asked about me giving some of the jewellery to the other two daughters. \n\nI said I will when they're both 18 and done with high school. I think kids their age usually aren't mature enough to understand the importance of the heirlooms or to take good care of them. When I was a teenager lots of girls at my school would bring family jewellery to school and it would be stolen.\n\nMy brother said I'm being unfair to my nieces and that if I'm going to give jewellery to the eldest, all of them should receive jewellery straight away or they'll feel left out. He said that I'm not the one who will have to deal with the younger two being sad. \n\nHe suggested I just gift all of them the jewellery now.

You mum would not warn you falling out over this. \n\nHopefully what I\u2019ve suggested could be a solution for you", "NTA, give the jewelry to you niece (maybe for her 21st birthday) and explain to the younger nieces they will receive jewelry when they are the same age as your niece is when she receives the jewelry", "First of all, I'm very sorry for your loss. Second, you're NTA. The two younger girls are absolutely at an age where they can understand that sometimes one person gets a gift and the others won't. Plus, waiting until they're 18 is absolutely a fine enough compromise.  \n\n\nI also 100% agree with the top comment saying to sit all the girls down, explain to them the reasoning, and let them pick their own/see what jewelry they're going to inherit. That way they don't feel left out. Plus, hopefully, they should understand why you would want to hang onto actual precious stone jewelry until they're 18.", "NTA. \n\nRe: feeling left out \n\nControl the narrative. \n\nI would let the girls know if there are specific pieces for them. Show them to them and let them wear it once in a special occasion at your private house, e.g. a memorial lunch for grandma. \n\nThen, they take them off. You show them how you\u2019re going to be taking care of it and keeping it safe for them by putting it into a safe or bank security box. \n\nThis helps them learn that the items are precious and how to best secure them. \n\nYou can present the three of them with similar matching less expensive jewelry. The younger girls will have something to wear. It\u2019s a new set of special jewelry commemorating the relationship between the women of your family, the nieces, you, and the grandma. \n\nI would get a backup of each necklace to gift the girls if they lose it, after they have a stable adult living situation with lower risk of theft or loss. \n\n\n\nRe: wedding:\n\nI recommend lending the items out to the eldest for her wedding but holding onto it for her until she has a living situation in which theft isn\u2019t a concern. You also want to gauge her responsibility regardless of her age. You know your family best. \n\nIt is extremely easy for folks to lose wedding jewelry and other heirlooms during the wedding. Offer to help transport it and keep it safe when she takes it off. It is super easy to accidentally leave it by the sink or let it fall in a hotel toilet. \n\nIt\u2019s why I really really recommend using replicas or cheaper items for weddings. You cannot replace some things. If it\u2019s her something borrowed, awesome. She can give them to you for safe keeping after the reception.\n\nMy advice is to wait until the youngest is 18 because even if you give the jewelry to the eldest niece, he could still let the younger nieces wear it. \n\nI like accessories and tried to take care of them. I lost so much costume jewelry as a kid even while being careful. 11 and 15 are not great ages for that. \n\nPlus, let\u2019s say they take the necklace off for PE and someone steals it. That would suck. \n\nHonestly \u2014 I would wait until they\u2019re settled in situations where the jewelry is less likely to get stolen. So for instance, not living with random Craigslist roomies. Not living in a dorm.", "NTA. Your brother has his own plans for that jewelry.", "NTA\nI received gold and diamond heirlooms from my grandpa when I was 15 (he was a jeweler). Lost all of them over time as I would take them off for sports. It sucks and now that I lost my grandpa I wish I had them. Your nieces will understand if you speak to them about it. Your brother doesn't need to be involved in this decision. He should respect that this will be more special because it's a latent gesture from grandma given by their beloved aunt.", "NTA, the younger nieces are 2 young", "NTA. 11 and 15 are old enough to understand that family jewelry is something to look forward to for their 18th birthday. It's a gift not a requirement. \n\nYour brother needs to remember it isn't his to do with as he sees fit. Fair is a weather description not life.", "NTA.  The jewelry is yours to distribute as you choose\u2014those were your mother\u2019s wishes.  One possible resolution is to make the necklace and earrings a wedding present\u2014you know it could be either the something old or something borrowed.  If you choose the latter, you could tell her to keep it when no one is around to hear you.  That way you have tied the gift to her wedding and also set the expectation that this will be a new tradition\u2014the pieces will commemorate big occasions in their lives\u2014wedding, graduation, etc.  Personally, all of my fine jewelry are \u201ctrophy\u201d pieces\u2014I bought them for myself to celebrate significant achievements in my career.  I will never part with them because I had to work so hard for them, and I do plan to pass them down as heirlooms to my nieces, so they have something tangible to remind them of what\u2019s possible.", "INFO: would the jewelry be safe in your brother\u2019s home/care?  Is it at risk of being stolen, pawned, given to someone else?", "NTA. Let them know you\u2019re keeping it for them till they\u2019re 18. And if they\u2019re sad, well they\u2019re sad.", "NTA.\n\nMy grandmother had a tradition with all the cousins that they got a very nice and already seasoned cast iron pan for a wedding gift. It was very much understood by all the cousins that we would not get our pan until we got married. It was just something special and a little ceremonial and none of us got jealous or sad that we had to wait. Even when my grandmother circumvented tradition and gave me my pan at 25 (only cousin still not married, whoohoo!) the only comments made were some gentle ribbing from my cousins about the family giving up on me getting married. \n\nGive the eldest her gift and explain to the younger ones that they will get their special gifts when they come of age. Make it seem special and exciting. They'll be fine.", "NTA\u2014I already posted, but I had an afterthought, and I noticed that a few other people have touched on it as well\u2014the possibility of Dad needing money and wanting the jewelry now so that he can sell it.  You see, when I was little, my grandmother wanted to leave me the family land.  It had been in my family for over 150 years, and I was the only grandchild that had actually lived on it\u2014the others were raised out of state.  She chose me because since it had been my home, she believed that I would do my best to keep it in the family.  It is on a coast and quite valuable.  The mistake was that she knew nothing about trusts and my father convinced her to leave it to him, with the verbal promise that he would bequeath it to me.  This agreement happened in a family meeting, and all of my aunts and uncles were present and agreed.  Fast forward many years, and my father has remarried and is diagnosed with esophageal cancer.  He never made a will.  The moment the chemo started affecting his mind, my step-siblings tried to take everything.  I got nothing except for my grandmother\u2019s land, and I was only able to save that due to a quirk in Texas\u2019 law that they did not know about.  \n\nMy point is that the minute you turn over that jewelry to minor children, you have no control over what happens to it.  If something happens to your brother\u2019s current spouse, the next one could decide that she wants the jewelry.  Can you trust your brother to say no under those circumstances?", "NTA.  Gift it to  your eldest niece as an engagement gift.  You can gift pieces to each of them over the years for significant milestones.  (18th bday, graduations, engagements, weddings...)  You'll fulfill your mother's wishes, make your nieces feel special & never have to purchase another gift for them again.  You get to gift to any/everybody you desire.  It's yours to give freely as you wish.", "Sell the jewelry and buy them each a car. Somehow I bet your brother won't think they should each be getting the same thing in that situation. NTA", "NTA. When I was 16, my dad upgraded my mom's wedding ring. They took the smaller, original diamond, put it in a new setting, and gave it to me for Christmas. I wore it to school and had to take it off for sports. Guess what? I lost it and to this day I have deep regret over it. I was young, dumb, and not yet responsible enough to handle that kind of jewelry.  \n\nI'm not saying that your nieces will do the same, but I can never get that ring back and have to live with losing something that was not only expensive but had a lot of significance to me and my parents. I would just explain to the younger ones that they will also get jewelry when they turn 18. If they can't accept your reasoning, then, in my opinion, it shows that they are not yet responsible enough to take care of the jewelry.", "NTA\n\nSeems like a wise choice to me.", "OP=NTA\n\npeople need to learn that everyone doesn't get the same things or at the same time.\n\nDoes brother let his 11 year old date because his 20 yr old has a fiancee or his 15 year old is going to a school dance?  \n\nDoes the 11 yr old have the same bedtime? same chores, get driver's permit too?  SOME things are simply age connected.   \nDad can take it in the chin when the kids whine and say, Your aunt has said you'll get your gift when you are a RESPONSIBLE Adult too(if you want him to even say that).  And then he can add something to the effect, that showing Auntie how you care for your belongings will likely promote you getting the gifts at 18 instead of 30.", "NTA.  You will be giving the younger two girls jewelry, just not right now.  And I agree with you that different ages dictate different gifts.", "NTA. I would tell the other girls that they will inherit at 18 and let them each pick a piece they want and can look forward to receiving. Jewelry does tend to disappear. In the meantime, give them each something smaller, like a locket or a pretty ring, that they can wear and know that more is on the way.", "NTA But I can see how it might be an issue between the girls. Is this a case of you already having their \u201cshares\u201d picked out? Then tell that to them. But if you intend to let them pick when they inherit, that\u2019ll cause some hurt feelings.

OP should show each of the girls what they will receive when they turn 18 and give the oldest her share because she is 18.
