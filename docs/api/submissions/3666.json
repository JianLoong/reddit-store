She had a fairly large collection of jewellery that is made from various precious metals and gems, it is all very valuable. \n\nBefore her passing, my mother and I talked a lot about what her wishes would be, and she told me she wants the jewellery passed from generation to generation for the women in the family.\n\nMy brother [m40s] has three daughters, [f20], [f15] and [f11].

I think kids their age usually aren't mature enough to understand the importance of the heirlooms or to take good care of them. When I was a teenager lots of girls at my school would bring family jewellery to school and it would be stolen.\n\nMy brother said I'm being unfair to my nieces and that if I'm going to give jewellery to the eldest, all of them should receive jewellery straight away or they'll feel left out.

Now that my maternal grandmother and my mom have passed and I inherited a very large jewelry collection, I have many pieces I want to give to my daughter and my younger Cousins' daughters.
