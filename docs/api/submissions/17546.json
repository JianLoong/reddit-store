For a backstory, I\u2019m a transgender male. I came out when I started my freshmen year. My mom didn\u2019t support that idea. She isn\u2019r religious or anything, but her stance on it is if I am born female, I will always be a female. \n\nAnyways, I met my wife when we were in college. Around that time me and my moms relationship was rocky, but still kept in touch here and there. My wife met my mom at a family gathering. My mom ignored her a lot and barely talked to her, she felt so overwhelmed that we just left. I apologized profusely for my mom\u2019s behavior, but she just told me it was fine and we went home to cuddle and watch a movie. \n\nSkipping forward a few years, I told my mom I was going propose to my girlfriend and she told me in her exact words \u201cI don\u2019t like that you\u2019re going to marry a girl, that\u2019s disgusting\u201d it really broke my heart for my mom to say that, while we had a rocky relationship, I still loved and respected my mom. After that day, I just left and cried to my wife. After I proposed and we were planning our wedding, we thought about who we should invite and who we shouldn\u2019t. My wife suggested I should invite my mom but I said no and that she wouldn\u2019t support us getting married. She told me that the least I could do is send her an invite and if she doesn\u2019t show up, then it\u2019s fine. I budged anyway and sent my mom an invitation, a couple days later she told me would come so she could see me on my big day. \n\nOn my wedding day, everything went great! Until the reception. My mom came up to me and told me how disgusting I was for kissing a girl and she didn\u2019t raise her \u201cDaughter\u201d to be this way. I had enough! I blew up at her saying she was a horrible mother, she gaslit me too many times to count and never supported me even though it made me happy. I told her she was verbally abusive and still is. The only reason I kept in contact with her was because of my sisters. I told her to get the hell out of my wedding and told her not to ever contact me again. She refused to leave so I told my best man and one of my groomsmen to take her out. It made suck a huge scene that I was slightly embarrassed but it felt so good to let all my anger out. During me and my wife\u2019s honey moon, I got a bunch of text messages from my aunt and uncles telling me that I was an asshole for blowing up at my mother and calling her a horrible person. They told me at least she showed up. I ignored all the messages but I have been feeling slightly guilty.

Now your child is older and becoming the person they were meant to be, and you should want the same thing, for them to be healthy and happy.\" I never thought of my child as depressed or sad, but after he started his transition process, I look back and see that he is such a happier and healthier man now than he ever was prior to his transition.

My heart hurts that your mom can\u2019t be happy for you as you are and that she needed to bring her nastiness into your bright and shiny beautiful day.

I have never thought of that. What an exceptional way to express your unconditional love for your trans child and to help another trans parent understand that their parental role does not change.", ">you should be greatful she took the time to abuse you on your wedding \n\nHonestly I'd ask the shitty relatives if this is what they intended to convey, because that's EXACTLY what they conveyed.\n\n\"So just to clarify, I should be greatful that she showed up in bad faith, intending to cause a scene and to disrespect my wife and I and to abuse me at my own wedding? She does not accept the reality that I am a man or that I'm married to a woman and never has, and the only reason she even was invited was that my WIFE wanted to give her grace and was hoping she'd be better than she has been thus far, but she showed up and instead completely embarrassed my wife by making a scene and showing her ass. Anyone who treats my wife like that has no place in our life.\" and then let them respond. They may only have Mom's side of the story; once they hear from OP, they may change their tune.

We are trying our hardest to remember not to mis-gender them, and we are terrified that this could make their life harder in the future, because we just want them to be happy. We did say when they first told us that we are likely to make mistakes, because it is difficult to suddenly switch after 15 years, but there is a difference between accidentally forgetting to use the correct pronouns and actively refusing to try. I guess we're lucky in that our child has chosen to keep their name since it's relatively gender neutral anyway, so that's one less thing to remember to get right\nHonestly, as a mother, the hardest thing for me is that now they are more comfortable being a bit more gender fluid, all my nail polishes have been stolen, and I strongly suspect that as soon as their newly pierced ears heal properly, I'm going to start losing earrings too! On the bright side, they want to wear a dress to their upcoming prom, so now I get to go prom dress shopping, which I never expected to get the chance to do!\nTheir grandparents on my husband's side will be another matter. We know they won't accept them (they are very bigoted and racist), but I'm letting my child decide how they want to navigate that. So far they just don't want to tell them because they don't want to cut contact, but I've let them know I'll support their decision, whatever it may be. My dad just went \"ok! As long as they're happy!\"", "Probably because I said I'm trans. A sizeable number of people hate us for that.

And of course one of the reasons those ventures went super into the hole was the large 'Salary' paid to him and his kids and supporters., for running the business so well...\n\nSo yeah, mom showed up and said what they weren't willing too but were thinking anyway, of course they'll support her.", "\"at least she showed up\"\n\nTo do what?

He was super awkward and shy. I was his supervisor and had an actual conversation with him maybe twice. He left for 2 years and came back a few months ago. He's a totally different person. Confident and friendly. It's amazing. It's so great to see him come out of his shell.", "I have a child who transitioned during middle school into high school. The before and after of their academic performance was blinding. Went from A's in elementary school to Cs and Ds in middle school (with zero motivation) back to As in high school, along with volunteer work and extra studying, and ended up in one of the best universities in the country. \n\nI guess feeling optimistic about your future and comfortable in your own body is a good thing.", "I like the way you phrased that and I really wondered if the fiance didn't press in the wrong direction. I've had almost the same exact experience as you describe where I needed the time and space to process, with my husband just being supportive of where I was in the moment. \n\nI don't love the way OP phrased the bit about \"budging\" to the fiance's desire to invite his mother. That feels like OP had a gut instinct about this whole thing, was set on the non-invite, and really it was the fiance who needed the wedding day to go a certain way. \n\nIf you've never imagined yourself NC with your own family I think it's almost impossible to imagine, or be fully comfortable with, a partner going NC with theirs. So it's not like I don't get it, but dang this was avoidable if the fiance had just trusted OPs instinct on his mom from the start.", "That\u2019s true, but the title pertains to familial issues and typically the biggest issue that trans people have with their families is that their families don\u2019t accept them.

And as someone here has said, having you SO encourage you to cut ties can make things feel more tense, make you feel more alienated. obviously given OP caved, he still felt some hope and it sucks that it ended the way it did but the wife is in no way an asshole and you maybe need to work on not projecting your feelings into strangers.", "Yes exactly, that was my assumption & that\u2019s unfortunately what happened for this person", "She has the same damn kid though.", "Ah yes, the ol' \"random\" changing of the genders.\n\nAlso what Hoggmen said.", "As someone who had a narcissistic parent, I feel this.

Parents could raise their children to become doctors and they instead decide to become an art major, does that warrant those parents to be abusive assholes to their kids because that's \"not what they had in mind when having a child\"?
