For a backstory, I\u2019m a transgender male. I came out when I started my freshmen year. My mom didn\u2019t support that idea. She isn\u2019r religious or anything, but her stance on it is if I am born female, I will always be a female. \n\nAnyways, I met my wife when we were in college. Around that time me and my moms relationship was rocky, but still kept in touch here and there. My wife met my mom at a family gathering. My mom ignored her a lot and barely talked to her, she felt so overwhelmed that we just left. I apologized profusely for my mom\u2019s behavior, but she just told me it was fine and we went home to cuddle and watch a movie. \n\nSkipping forward a few years, I told my mom I was going propose to my girlfriend and she told me in her exact words \u201cI don\u2019t like that you\u2019re going to marry a girl, that\u2019s disgusting\u201d it really broke my heart for my mom to say that, while we had a rocky relationship, I still loved and respected my mom. After that day, I just left and cried to my wife. After I proposed and we were planning our wedding, we thought about who we should invite and who we shouldn\u2019t. My wife suggested I should invite my mom but I said no and that she wouldn\u2019t support us getting married. She told me that the least I could do is send her an invite and if she doesn\u2019t show up, then it\u2019s fine. I budged anyway and sent my mom an invitation, a couple days later she told me would come so she could see me on my big day. \n\nOn my wedding day, everything went great! Until the reception. My mom came up to me and told me how disgusting I was for kissing a girl and she didn\u2019t raise her \u201cDaughter\u201d to be this way. I had enough! I blew up at her saying she was a horrible mother, she gaslit me too many times to count and never supported me even though it made me happy. I told her she was verbally abusive and still is. The only reason I kept in contact with her was because of my sisters. I told her to get the hell out of my wedding and told her not to ever contact me again. She refused to leave so I told my best man and one of my groomsmen to take her out. It made suck a huge scene that I was slightly embarrassed but it felt so good to let all my anger out. During me and my wife\u2019s honey moon, I got a bunch of text messages from my aunt and uncles telling me that I was an asshole for blowing up at my mother and calling her a horrible person. They told me at least she showed up. I ignored all the messages but I have been feeling slightly guilty.

Now your child is older and becoming the person they were meant to be, and you should want the same thing, for them to be healthy and happy.\" I never thought of my child as depressed or sad, but after he started his transition process, I look back and see that he is such a happier and healthier man now than he ever was prior to his transition.
