For a backstory, I\u2019m a transgender male. I came out when I started my freshmen year. My mom didn\u2019t support that idea. She isn\u2019r religious or anything, but her stance on it is if I am born female, I will always be a female. \n\nAnyways, I met my wife when we were in college. Around that time me and my moms relationship was rocky, but still kept in touch here and there. My wife met my mom at a family gathering. My mom ignored her a lot and barely talked to her, she felt so overwhelmed that we just left. I apologized profusely for my mom\u2019s behavior, but she just told me it was fine and we went home to cuddle and watch a movie. \n\nSkipping forward a few years, I told my mom I was going propose to my girlfriend and she told me in her exact words \u201cI don\u2019t like that you\u2019re going to marry a girl, that\u2019s disgusting\u201d it really broke my heart for my mom to say that, while we had a rocky relationship, I still loved and respected my mom. After that day, I just left and cried to my wife. After I proposed and we were planning our wedding, we thought about who we should invite and who we shouldn\u2019t. My wife suggested I should invite my mom but I said no and that she wouldn\u2019t support us getting married. She told me that the least I could do is send her an invite and if she doesn\u2019t show up, then it\u2019s fine. I budged anyway and sent my mom an invitation, a couple days later she told me would come so she could see me on my big day. \n\nOn my wedding day, everything went great! Until the reception. My mom came up to me and told me how disgusting I was for kissing a girl and she didn\u2019t raise her \u201cDaughter\u201d to be this way. I had enough! I blew up at her saying she was a horrible mother, she gaslit me too many times to count and never supported me even though it made me happy. I told her she was verbally abusive and still is. The only reason I kept in contact with her was because of my sisters. I told her to get the hell out of my wedding and told her not to ever contact me again. She refused to leave so I told my best man and one of my groomsmen to take her out. It made suck a huge scene that I was slightly embarrassed but it felt so good to let all my anger out. During me and my wife\u2019s honey moon, I got a bunch of text messages from my aunt and uncles telling me that I was an asshole for blowing up at my mother and calling her a horrible person. They told me at least she showed up. I ignored all the messages but I have been feeling slightly guilty.

Why show up at all of she's going to be offended by you kissing your bride? Did she not think that would be part of it?", "You\u2019re absolutely not an a/h. But your extended family is definitely in contact with one. Your mother has their \u2018ear\u2019 and has cried loudly to them about how horribly you treated her on YOUR wedding day. But in doing so are totally glossing over the reason why you blew up at her in the first place. \n\nYou can bet that even some of your uncles and aunts recognize how cruel your mother may have been over the years, but they are just doing their part to speak on her behalf because in some way they almost have to. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to acknowledge that you did anything wrong. Let them all vent, and don\u2019t look back. Look forward to creating the life you deserve with people who you know really care about you.", "NTA, she's a miserable asshole who abused you. Congratulations to you and your wife", "NTA, you absolutely do not need to have your transphobic and homophobic mom in you and your wife\u2019s lives. she showed up to your wedding to treat you like shit, she deserves no benefit of the doubt.", "NTA I'm so sorry. If you can maybe go no contact with mom and everyone who supports her abusive behavior. I'm sorry your mom is so cruel and I am glad you confronted her. I wish you and your wife all the best.", "NTA - She showed up to be a close-minded bigot. *At your wedding.* What did she think would happen, that you would magically turn into a woman once she told you she was upset you kissed your \\*checks notes\\* **WIFE**??\n\nAnyone siding with, or enabling, her behavior also needs to be cut off. The last thing you need is more people with their heads up their rumpasses griping that you told their leader that you won't tolerate her b.s.\n\nIf she isn't loving you for who you are, then she IS a horrible mother. If the truth hurts, she should change her behavior.", "NTA. First of all, your wife has a heart of gold. Despite your mother ignoring her and not being supportive she still wanted to invite her. That's sweet.\nSecond. Go NC with your mother.

And if anything the day got better after your birthing pod was ejected from the venue.\n\nYou gave her every chance.\n\nIf you ever start to feel any regret when it comes to contact with your mother (or lack there of)  just remember that.\n\nCongratulations on getting married too", "Definitely, 100% NTA. Congrats on the wedding.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry the whole event was in front of family and friends. At your wedding no less. This reminded me of something my mother would do, making a scene. Sometimes you have to set that boundary and that truly makes my heart hurt for you OP.", "NTA. You did the right thing and your mom sucks", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve been dealing with this for so long. Your feelings are valid and you are valid. I went no contact with my mother 2 years ago to protect my peace. It was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made.", "NTA. Your mother never supported you like a parent should, and on your wedding day (of all days!), you deserve to be surrounded by those that love and support you.\n\nI wish you and your wife many, many years of happiness together \u2661", "NTA! Mom of a transgender son here. And I think she is the disgusting one. I tell all of the moms that ask me for advice about how to deal with their child coming out as trans the same piece of advice: \"when you were pregnant and people asked do you want a boy or a girl, you probably responded 'I don't care as long as they are healthy and happy!' Now your child is older and becoming the person they were meant to be, and you should want the same thing, for them to be healthy and happy.\" I never thought of my child as depressed or sad, but after he started his transition process, I look back and see that he is such a happier and healthier man now than he ever was prior to his transition. And that makes me happy and proud of him for finding and being who he truly is.\n\nI'll be your mom if you want one who accepts and loves you for being you!", "NTA. You owe that awful woman NOTHING. Not even a glass of water, and anybody who wants to say otherwise is kindly invited to fuck right off. You had the kind heart to invite her to YOUR WEDDING even when she was a bigot about your feelings and your life all along and you're to blame? Nope. You have a wonderful family in your wife and I hope both of you are very happy without that human shaped turd in your life.", "YTA because I refuse to believe it\u2019s real, any sane person would feel 0 guilt", "I DON'T understand the family. He didn't make them uncomfortable, she started a scene, the victim who is man enough to stand up for himself and call out a bigot is an awesome thing to see, not something awkward to chastise", "The first sentence can be misunderstood.", "OP should \"just show up\" to the family gathering, make a huge mess, then ask if showing up is good enough.\n\nSadly it would make everything worse, but hey, the logic is sound.", "RIGHT?! Didn't even have the spine to do it in the speak now section, had to try to be a slimy little coward about it", "Yeah, people are so quick to act high and mighty for the wrong people. If someone is against you, you dont show them your submissiveness, you simply leave them.", "IDK that that makes you an asshole, just wrongly hopeful", "Can we stop with the \u201cytA to yOUrSeLF\u201d comments. Op isn\u2019t an asshole for suffering transphobic abuse from his mother.", "I definitely think he was in his rights but yelling at a wedding is usually not a great way to get the party going. Again he is completely right for doing so", "Also in addition. I guess a lot of people didn't hear the mom being an ah but probably everyone heard him shouting to his mom."]}
