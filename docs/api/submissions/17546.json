For a backstory, I\u2019m a transgender male. I came out when I started my freshmen year. My mom didn\u2019t support that idea. She isn\u2019r religious or anything, but her stance on it is if I am born female, I will always be a female. \n\nAnyways, I met my wife when we were in college. Around that time me and my moms relationship was rocky, but still kept in touch here and there. My wife met my mom at a family gathering. My mom ignored her a lot and barely talked to her, she felt so overwhelmed that we just left. I apologized profusely for my mom\u2019s behavior, but she just told me it was fine and we went home to cuddle and watch a movie. \n\nSkipping forward a few years, I told my mom I was going propose to my girlfriend and she told me in her exact words \u201cI don\u2019t like that you\u2019re going to marry a girl, that\u2019s disgusting\u201d it really broke my heart for my mom to say that, while we had a rocky relationship, I still loved and respected my mom. After that day, I just left and cried to my wife. After I proposed and we were planning our wedding, we thought about who we should invite and who we shouldn\u2019t. My wife suggested I should invite my mom but I said no and that she wouldn\u2019t support us getting married. She told me that the least I could do is send her an invite and if she doesn\u2019t show up, then it\u2019s fine. I budged anyway and sent my mom an invitation, a couple days later she told me would come so she could see me on my big day. \n\nOn my wedding day, everything went great! Until the reception. My mom came up to me and told me how disgusting I was for kissing a girl and she didn\u2019t raise her \u201cDaughter\u201d to be this way. I had enough! I blew up at her saying she was a horrible mother, she gaslit me too many times to count and never supported me even though it made me happy. I told her she was verbally abusive and still is. The only reason I kept in contact with her was because of my sisters. I told her to get the hell out of my wedding and told her not to ever contact me again. She refused to leave so I told my best man and one of my groomsmen to take her out. It made suck a huge scene that I was slightly embarrassed but it felt so good to let all my anger out. During me and my wife\u2019s honey moon, I got a bunch of text messages from my aunt and uncles telling me that I was an asshole for blowing up at my mother and calling her a horrible person. They told me at least she showed up. I ignored all the messages but I have been feeling slightly guilty.

Now your child is older and becoming the person they were meant to be, and you should want the same thing, for them to be healthy and happy.\" I never thought of my child as depressed or sad, but after he started his transition process, I look back and see that he is such a happier and healthier man now than he ever was prior to his transition.

Your mother is abusive and likely mentally ill. Your relatives are either also sick transphobes or, likely, your mother fed them a version of events that was most flattering to her.

Did she not expect a kiss at a wedding ceremony? \ud83e\uddd0 She's horrible, mean, and transphobic and it's completely understandable that you blew up.

It was your wedding.  You and your wife's special day.  And your mom just came to insult you.  She came to hurt you.  After a lifetime of it it sounds like.

But she intentionally sought out the way to hurt you the most. On your wedding day. Deliberately.\nShe could have just stayed home.\nIf your family needs explanation, tell them that.

I know she\u2019s your mom and it really sucks when a parent can\u2019t get over themselves and their own views and put their child first. Unfortunately there are parents who just don\u2019t want to. This is almost more frustrating then most as usually at least they\u2019re like this cause they\u2019re super religious and from their view they think they\u2019re looking out for you- trying to save your soul from damnation or whatever.\n\nNo offense but your mom doesn\u2019t even have the delusional moral high ground on her side; she\u2019s just being a hateful bigot.\n\nSorry you had to deal with this and that you have idiotic family members who thing showing up to ruin a wedding is a way of showing support.

However, as someone who is now estranged from my mother, if my partner would have tried to get me to cut ties sooner or didn\u2019t try to encourage me to have a relationship, I think I would have felt like I was being alienated by everyone. There\u2019s a big piece of it that when a partner accepts your family for what they are, you feel more accepted and lived yourself. My partner was always supportive of what I needed but really wanted me to make sure I didn\u2019t cut ties flippantly or prematurely.

I explained why I encourage him to, he decided against inviting anyone from his family. \n\nOP\u2019s wife isn\u2019t an asshole from my point of view. Had I not encouraged my husband to reach out, he\u2019d be constantly crying in my arms about how much he misses his family despite how awful they are.

And do NOT say drugs because they do not bring you true happiness, just short term dopamine. If you\u2019re a parent, I hope your kids are okay. Id imagine if any of them ended up being gay or trans they would hide their true selves from you out of fear.  A parent is supposed to show unconditional love to their child.

This was a learning experience. If his wife pushes for him to have a relationship with his mom again after seeing what happened at the reception, THEN she would be an asshole.  But at the moment, I think her original intentions were good. Was she a bit naive? Absolutely.  But weddings mess people up.  I can see her being worried that Op would regret not having his mom there in the long run, and she just wanted to leave the door open for reconciliation.  ...But then ops mom decided to slam it in their faces and bolt it shut instead.
