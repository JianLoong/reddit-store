That I didn't seem to be taking him remarrying and having half siblings well, and that he was worried I would end up isolating myself in the future and that I would hurt my half siblings when they realized I clearly favored my full blood siblings over them. He asked me to give therapy a go to see if I could find a way to process mom not being there and move on to fully accept my half siblings, and maybe even to see my stepmom as something more than his wife. I told him I'd go. First therapist was a bust. She spent the whole session talking about religion. Dad didn't send me back. Second therapist was different. He saw that therapy wasn't something I was totally comfortable with and he set me up with a therapy diary. He told me to call it my therapy notebook, my therapy scrapbook or whatever made it feel the most comfortable for me. But he told me I could write stuff I could not express out loud. He also told me I could write stuff to bring up in future sessions.\n\nEarly sessions I wrote a lot about missing my mom and the family we should have and how things would never be the same. After a while I also wrote down how I felt like my half siblings could never mean as much to me as my full siblings because my full siblings and I shared our parents. And there was this more natural bond. I wrote how I did not think I would ever love my half siblings but I still thought they were part of my family and I hoped they would have good lives. There were some notes in it about how something happened and I missed mom and I wished my dad's wife and half siblings could go so we could get mom back. That was maybe written three or four times. There was also a page where I talked about how I wanted a tattoo of the family I wanted us to be and how that wouldn't include my dad's wife or my half siblings.\n\nI did three years of therapy and then ended it and threw the diary out. But dad fished it out and decided to keep it. Then he read it. Then showed his wife. They left it where the kids found it and then read it as well. Now everything has gone crazy. My dad ended up confronting me and we argued because he told me I had written some very unfair things. I told him therapy can't always change how you feel, just how you act. He said he didn't send me to therapy to act the part. I told him he was getting off the point and he should never have read the diary, shared it around, etc. He said that he was my father and he had a right to read it. I told him that diary was none of his business and never should have been family reading. He told me that's a poor point to make when I wrote that my half siblings were unlovable for simply having the wrong mother.

If you have kids or work with kids or teenagers (for e.g. you are a teacher or social worker) please educate them about the secrecy of correspondence.

Absolutely NTA\nWhat the fuck?\nSo very sorry you are dealing with this.  Now your dad has turned your whole family against you for normal 11 year old blended family feelings.  Your dad is the one that needs therapy!!! Who the hell does this to their child??  Everyone else\u2019s feelings are more important than yours?  Who in their right mind would let everyone read that??  Holy cow:  what a violation of trust.  I can\u2019t even imagine.  Can you move in with a grandparent or something?  This is insane.", "NTA\n\nHe is in the wrong. That diary is for you and at most, your therapist. Him reading it was a major breach of trust, one that is hard to regain. It wasn't ever meant for him to read and he has no justification to be hurt by its contents.", "NTA. it doesn't matter what you wrote in there, it is a massive violation of your privacy and shows a complete lack of respect for your boundaries. He is majorly TA.", "NTA. \n\nThe most toxic thing parents do in these situations is share the journal WITH THE KIDS. It really does NOTHING good for the family dynamic (especially one the parent so desperately craves) to share it with the kids. \n\nIt would\u2019ve still been disrespectful for him to read it as he seems to forget they were \u201cprivate thoughts\u201d but for him to let the whole family read it is something else entirely. \n\nThis is a violation of trust and you are in no way wrong for writing down how you felt. \n\nYour dad is a MAJOR AH.", "Wow! Talk about crossing major boundaries.  Your father is a major asshole to have not only kept it but then to share it as if it is OK to blast someone's personal thoughts. He needs to get over himself, and he seems to be the problem with trying to force a perfect family.\n\nYou are NTA in any shape or form, and he needed to hear that he should have minded his business and left it in the trash. Talk about turning his back on his own child to simply please his new wife and kids.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYour dad is an arsehole. He is an arsehole for reading the journal.

Your diary was private and yours. He had NO right to read it much less share it with anyone else. You were in the right to call him out on it.", "Comprehensively NTA.\nYou are entitled to having your feelings, firstly. Having those feelings (whatever they are) is not wrong.\n\nBut secondly/mainly, anyone who reads another person's diary or goes through their phone without permission deserves everything they get.\nLiterally, even if the person wrote how they wished the snooper dead, the snooper is still the bad person here and the writer the wronged party.", "NTA. He\u2019s pissed he can\u2019t control you via therapy, so now he\u2019s shared your therapy journal with the family to guilt you. If they feel bad about what you wrote, it\u2019s his fault they read it and to be honest, he sounds pretty crap.

Sometimes the children take to their new family dynamics, sometimes not. Unless there\u2019s bullying, isolation, neglect, etc it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault.  Just the way we are as fallible and flawed humans. The diary incident is what makes him a rock solid AH. Teens are difficult to talk to but spying doesn\u2019t help.", "Very clearly NTA, diaries in general are highly personal, a therapy diary even more so.

Your father sent you to therapy to \"fix\" you so you'd be and act the way he wanted. He then decided that his ridiculous entitlement meant he could invade your privacy because he wanted to.

What your father did was a massive privacy violation and a breech of trust. He had absolutely no right to read that book. He had no right to show his wife. Leaving it for their kids to read is a sabotage of your relationship with them. He behaved exceptionally badly, and he owes you a huge apology. You have done absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA.\n\nBut boy oh boy is your father.  That was private and confidential and reflected how you felt then.  This is an incredible violation of trust and your father absolutely owes you an apology.\n\nI suggest that you, as soon as you can, leave the house and go no-contact with your father.", "NTA. Your father, however, broke all trust and made everything worse for everybody involved. If you were to blame for anything, it was for not destroying the book totally, but your father should still have respected your privacy.", "NTA- I actually understand the sentiment. In split families, the weight is on the parents to make the situation work. I'm sick to my stomach that they all did this, especially the two adults. If there is anything salvageable in the relationships with the step-siblings, since this should have started as a friendship first, try. Especially since now they may be scared the parents will do the same with their private thoughts. I saw nothing unusual in your writings, in fact they seem pretty heartfelt, and well written. Keep up the writing, in fiction form, there's a reason why so much fiction really seems like the truth. Also, if you have a guidance counselor you can talk to?", "NTA. You\u2019re entitled to your feelings. If he doesn\u2019t like then, that\u2019s just too damned bad. Also what did he hope to gain by sharing it with other people? The only possible result was hurt feelings. I\u2019m sorry but your Dad is totally in the wrong here. If he doesn\u2019t realize it just steer clear as much as possible. Sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "NTA.\n\nLike I always say and society always shows you, family will always betray you before strangers will. \n\nBlind love of family is a blindspot for too many people. It's actually a red flag of mine when talking with potential friends.", "NTA.\n\nAnd honestly, I with it weren't true, but I don't know that this breach of your trust is something you will ever fully be able to get past.", "NTA. Therapy is private, and your journal was part of that. But even if it was just a journal you kept on your own without therapy, your father is guilty of a major invasion of privacy and broke your trust.\n\n\nAlso, he invalidated your feelings. Nobody can force someone to love someone else, whether a step sibling, or even a blood sibling. You may never love your step siblings like your blood siblings, but you may grow into the best of friends. It takes time.\n\nIf there are any AHs here, they are your father and step family for disrespecting your privacy.", "NTA\n\nWhat he did was just as bad as if he had stolen your therapist's notes to read and share. It's honestly an unforgivable violation of your most personal safe space. The only justification would be if he was sure that you were in a place where reading it might save your life.\n\nYour feelings are valid, even if they (or even you) don't like them. Some mixed families blend perfectly, and some never will. It doesn't sound like you have any animosity towards your newer family, but you're willing to go along to get along. Your dad's gross violation is what's responsible for all this awkwardness.", "NTA.  Talk about self fulfilling prophecies.  He sent you to therapy because he was worried you would isolate yourself and that you would hurt your half siblings feelings\u2026.queue your father\u2019s actions causing you to pull away from him and your father\u2019s actions hurting your half siblings.  He violated your trust.  You are absolutely entitled to your feelings and your hurt. I\u2019m so sorry he did that to you.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA  but your dad is. He\u2019s trying to force this perfect relationship between you and your now stepfamily. The more he forces, the less receptive you\u2019ll be to doing it. And he was absolutely wrong to read it. Him being your father doesn\u2019t entitled him to. What was rotten in the journal is no different that if it had been said out loud to your therapist. And the therapist would not of shared any of those thing with him, nor would your dad been in with you during each of your sessions. It\u2019s a breach of confidentiality. And it completely normal to miss you mom and the family that you had. It\u2019s also normal to not love and care for stepfamily like you don\u2019t our bio family, and no amount of therapy can change that, which is what your dad hoped would happen. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with all this and for the loss of your mom.

He was 100% wrong to read the diary. You are allowed to have a place where you can talk freely about your feelings. He over stepped some major bounds and damaged your relationship.

They are completely normal feelings for an 11 yo going through a traumatic life change. I couldn't imagine what that must have felt like for you, then having your family make you feel bad about your legitimate feelings? That's rough, but you should feel proud that you have gotten through everything without the support you needed from your family. You're a strong person and don't let your family put you down or feel bad about this.

Dad seems to have been hoping you'd be reprogrammed, rather than gain any personal insight and coping skills.\n\n It sounds to me as if your father wants to disown any part his choices had in the situation. That doesn't mean he was wrong to divorce and remarry, though if the divorce was the result of his having an affair with the woman he subsequently married he bears a great deal of blame.

Part of me thinks he showed everyone what you wrote because he knew keeping and reading the journal was terrible, but now everyone is upset, so you're the bad guy now as far as he's concerned, not him. He seems to be forgetting that him keeping the journal and reading it was his choice. He chose to show his wife, knowing it would upset her. He left that journal out where the kids could see it.

I wrote once about my suicidal thoughts but that I wasn\u2019t planning or going to act on them. The school official took my diary and decided to read it and once they did all they did was stare at me and shake their head and in front of the whole class said \u201cI can\u2019t believe you would write this.

You then felt like you could get no more benefit from this diary and threw it away. Your father fishes it out of the trash and stashes it away for 3 years before finally reading it and showing it to your stepmom and the half siblings.

Drama ensues.\n\nYour diary was not intended as family reading. NTA. \n\nTrust and respect have to be earned (epic fail on his part). It's not like you went out of your way to tell them these things, and after 3 years when the diary reappears, you were blindsided by this betrayal. Your father demanded \"love\" on your part (demanding that you feel a specific way) rather than simply requesting that you show courtesy and respect to your stepmom and half siblings (asking that you act a specific way) when interacting with your blended family. Clearly, you cannot help how your feel (emotions) but you can look at your interactions to show courtesy and respect to the family.
