My dad sat me down before sending me and told me he was worried about me and our family. That I didn't seem to be taking him remarrying and having half siblings well, and that he was worried I would end up isolating myself in the future and that I would hurt my half siblings when they realized I clearly favored my full blood siblings over them. He asked me to give therapy a go to see if I could find a way to process mom not being there and move on to fully accept my half siblings, and maybe even to see my stepmom as something more than his wife. I told him I'd go. First therapist was a bust. She spent the whole session talking about religion. Dad didn't send me back. Second therapist was different. He saw that therapy wasn't something I was totally comfortable with and he set me up with a therapy diary. He told me to call it my therapy notebook, my therapy scrapbook or whatever made it feel the most comfortable for me. But he told me I could write stuff I could not express out loud. He also told me I could write stuff to bring up in future sessions.\n\nEarly sessions I wrote a lot about missing my mom and the family we should have and how things would never be the same. After a while I also wrote down how I felt like my half siblings could never mean as much to me as my full siblings because my full siblings and I shared our parents. And there was this more natural bond. I wrote how I did not think I would ever love my half siblings but I still thought they were part of my family and I hoped they would have good lives. There were some notes in it about how something happened and I missed mom and I wished my dad's wife and half siblings could go so we could get mom back. That was maybe written three or four times. There was also a page where I talked about how I wanted a tattoo of the family I wanted us to be and how that wouldn't include my dad's wife or my half siblings.\n\nI did three years of therapy and then ended it and threw the diary out. But dad fished it out and decided to keep it. Then he read it. Then showed his wife. They left it where the kids found it and then read it as well. Now everything has gone crazy. My dad ended up confronting me and we argued because he told me I had written some very unfair things. I told him therapy can't always change how you feel, just how you act. He said he didn't send me to therapy to act the part. I told him he was getting off the point and he should never have read the diary, shared it around, etc. He said that he was my father and he had a right to read it. I told him that diary was none of his business and never should have been family reading. He told me that's a poor point to make when I wrote that my half siblings were unlovable for simply having the wrong mother.

If you have kids or work with kids or teenagers (for e.g. you are a teacher or social worker) please educate them about the secrecy of correspondence.

Absolutely NTA\nWhat the fuck?\nSo very sorry you are dealing with this.  Now your dad has turned your whole family against you for normal 11 year old blended family feelings.  Your dad is the one that needs therapy!!! Who the hell does this to their child??  Everyone else\u2019s feelings are more important than yours?  Who in their right mind would let everyone read that??  Holy cow:  what a violation of trust.  I can\u2019t even imagine.  Can you move in with a grandparent or something?  This is insane.", "NTA\n\nHe is in the wrong. That diary is for you and at most, your therapist. Him reading it was a major breach of trust, one that is hard to regain. It wasn't ever meant for him to read and he has no justification to be hurt by its contents.", "NTA. it doesn't matter what you wrote in there, it is a massive violation of your privacy and shows a complete lack of respect for your boundaries. He is majorly TA.", "NTA. \n\nThe most toxic thing parents do in these situations is share the journal WITH THE KIDS. It really does NOTHING good for the family dynamic (especially one the parent so desperately craves) to share it with the kids. \n\nIt would\u2019ve still been disrespectful for him to read it as he seems to forget they were \u201cprivate thoughts\u201d but for him to let the whole family read it is something else entirely. \n\nThis is a violation of trust and you are in no way wrong for writing down how you felt. \n\nYour dad is a MAJOR AH.", "Wow! Talk about crossing major boundaries.  Your father is a major asshole to have not only kept it but then to share it as if it is OK to blast someone's personal thoughts. He needs to get over himself, and he seems to be the problem with trying to force a perfect family.\n\nYou are NTA in any shape or form, and he needed to hear that he should have minded his business and left it in the trash. Talk about turning his back on his own child to simply please his new wife and kids.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYour dad is an arsehole. He is an arsehole for reading the journal.

Your diary was private and yours. He had NO right to read it much less share it with anyone else. You were in the right to call him out on it.", "Comprehensively NTA.\nYou are entitled to having your feelings, firstly. Having those feelings (whatever they are) is not wrong.\n\nBut secondly/mainly, anyone who reads another person's diary or goes through their phone without permission deserves everything they get.\nLiterally, even if the person wrote how they wished the snooper dead, the snooper is still the bad person here and the writer the wronged party.", "NTA. He\u2019s pissed he can\u2019t control you via therapy, so now he\u2019s shared your therapy journal with the family to guilt you. If they feel bad about what you wrote, it\u2019s his fault they read it and to be honest, he sounds pretty crap.

Sometimes the children take to their new family dynamics, sometimes not. Unless there\u2019s bullying, isolation, neglect, etc it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault.  Just the way we are as fallible and flawed humans. The diary incident is what makes him a rock solid AH. Teens are difficult to talk to but spying doesn\u2019t help.", "Very clearly NTA, diaries in general are highly personal, a therapy diary even more so.

Your father sent you to therapy to \"fix\" you so you'd be and act the way he wanted. He then decided that his ridiculous entitlement meant he could invade your privacy because he wanted to.

What your father did was a massive privacy violation and a breech of trust. He had absolutely no right to read that book. He had no right to show his wife. Leaving it for their kids to read is a sabotage of your relationship with them. He behaved exceptionally badly, and he owes you a huge apology. You have done absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA.\n\nBut boy oh boy is your father.  That was private and confidential and reflected how you felt then.  This is an incredible violation of trust and your father absolutely owes you an apology.\n\nI suggest that you, as soon as you can, leave the house and go no-contact with your father.", "NTA. Your father, however, broke all trust and made everything worse for everybody involved. If you were to blame for anything, it was for not destroying the book totally, but your father should still have respected your privacy.", "NTA- I actually understand the sentiment. In split families, the weight is on the parents to make the situation work. I'm sick to my stomach that they all did this, especially the two adults. If there is anything salvageable in the relationships with the step-siblings, since this should have started as a friendship first, try. Especially since now they may be scared the parents will do the same with their private thoughts. I saw nothing unusual in your writings, in fact they seem pretty heartfelt, and well written. Keep up the writing, in fiction form, there's a reason why so much fiction really seems like the truth. Also, if you have a guidance counselor you can talk to?", "NTA. You\u2019re entitled to your feelings. If he doesn\u2019t like then, that\u2019s just too damned bad. Also what did he hope to gain by sharing it with other people? The only possible result was hurt feelings. I\u2019m sorry but your Dad is totally in the wrong here. If he doesn\u2019t realize it just steer clear as much as possible. Sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "NTA.\n\nLike I always say and society always shows you, family will always betray you before strangers will. \n\nBlind love of family is a blindspot for too many people. It's actually a red flag of mine when talking with potential friends.", "NTA.\n\nAnd honestly, I with it weren't true, but I don't know that this breach of your trust is something you will ever fully be able to get past.", "NTA. Therapy is private, and your journal was part of that. But even if it was just a journal you kept on your own without therapy, your father is guilty of a major invasion of privacy and broke your trust.\n\n\nAlso, he invalidated your feelings. Nobody can force someone to love someone else, whether a step sibling, or even a blood sibling. You may never love your step siblings like your blood siblings, but you may grow into the best of friends. It takes time.\n\nIf there are any AHs here, they are your father and step family for disrespecting your privacy.", "NTA\n\nWhat he did was just as bad as if he had stolen your therapist's notes to read and share. It's honestly an unforgivable violation of your most personal safe space. The only justification would be if he was sure that you were in a place where reading it might save your life.\n\nYour feelings are valid, even if they (or even you) don't like them. Some mixed families blend perfectly, and some never will. It doesn't sound like you have any animosity towards your newer family, but you're willing to go along to get along. Your dad's gross violation is what's responsible for all this awkwardness.", "NTA.  Talk about self fulfilling prophecies.  He sent you to therapy because he was worried you would isolate yourself and that you would hurt your half siblings feelings\u2026.queue your father\u2019s actions causing you to pull away from him and your father\u2019s actions hurting your half siblings.  He violated your trust.  You are absolutely entitled to your feelings and your hurt. I\u2019m so sorry he did that to you.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA  but your dad is. He\u2019s trying to force this perfect relationship between you and your now stepfamily. The more he forces, the less receptive you\u2019ll be to doing it. And he was absolutely wrong to read it. Him being your father doesn\u2019t entitled him to. What was rotten in the journal is no different that if it had been said out loud to your therapist. And the therapist would not of shared any of those thing with him, nor would your dad been in with you during each of your sessions. It\u2019s a breach of confidentiality. And it completely normal to miss you mom and the family that you had. It\u2019s also normal to not love and care for stepfamily like you don\u2019t our bio family, and no amount of therapy can change that, which is what your dad hoped would happen. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with all this and for the loss of your mom.

He was 100% wrong to read the diary. You are allowed to have a place where you can talk freely about your feelings. He over stepped some major bounds and damaged your relationship.

Still an idiotic thing for him to do.", "Absolutely!!!", "I guess he can ironically get part of his wish and have you like your half siblings more than him now.", "Show him this, since he likes reading so much!", "That does suck, a lot. But this situation isn't your fault either. I hope you don't put that blame on yourself.", "You are old enough to move in with them now and the police not take your back. The police often see it as a waste of time and resources to force home a 17 year old who is staying somewhere safe. Regardless, get a part time job so you can save up some money.", "I\u2019d say try calling your therapist to see if they can talk to your dad (maybe even just in the phone) about why him reading that and sharing it was absolutely awful. I think your therapist (if they\u2019re a good one) would for sure side with you and maybe even berate your father for what he did !", "Tell your dad he should get therapy to deal with his disagreement on how you should feel dealing with merging families. I don't think the therapist will agree with anything he has done and said regarding how he treated you. Hopefully that will open his eyes to see how he's being a huge asshole and not a very good father. I have a 12 year old and I couldn't imagine saying and treating him how your dad did if he were going through such a huge change. I'm sorry, none of this is your fault and you've done nothing wrong.\n\nYour family has likely already told others about this, especially since they shared your therapy journal with the other kids. You may want to ask other family members if they heard anything from your family about you if you don't want to over share. You can see if they know about before revealing anything you don't want to.\n\nOh, and those feelings you wrote about? They are completely normal feelings for an 11 yo going through a traumatic life change. I couldn't imagine what that must have felt like for you, then having your family make you feel bad about your legitimate feelings? That's rough, but you should feel proud that you have gotten through everything without the support you needed from your family. You're a strong person and don't let your family put you down or feel bad about this. You are definitely NTA here and good for you that you were able to express your feelings in writing and therapy rather than lashing out verbally and physically towards your family. That's a very mature way to go about handling difficult feelings.", "Plus he chose to upset your half siblings by leaving it out where they could find it. That is some serious emotional manipulation there.", "You shouldn't have to do more than that. Your father has shown that what he, his wife, and your step siblings feel is monumentally more important than you, how you feel or basic human decency towards you.\n\n\nJesus. Is he trying to get back at your mother or something. This is just so hateful and hostile of him.  \n\n\nI'd ask for another therapist. Say you guess you have some more things to work out. Then talk it out, don't write anything down, and ask for tips to help escape from this hellhole, retain your \nself respect and self-regard, and choose the most effective steps to successfully fly away and succeed in life despite having such a ridiculous homelife.\n\n\n(NTA obviously)", "Prob should have burned it just to make sure.", "NTA because everyone deserves privacy and your father didn't respect that.\n\n\nThere are multiple lessons you can learn from this.\n\n1. Your father has a different approach to privacy than you expected him to.\n2. If you write something down it can be read and shared.\n3. Even though the way you feel is not surprising it can still hurt someone.\n\nI'd recommend to talk to everyone involved one to one to make sure they know you didn't intend to hurt their feelings and that even though you're hurt by their actions you respect them (and their privacy).", "Good, OP. Stay firm on that. You are NTA. This man does not deserve your forgiveness, your trust, or your respect. His actions violated doctor-patient privilege, and also any potential for a real bond between the two of you. I\u2019m so sorry you were treated in this way. As an 11 year old child you had every right to process your grief and loss privately however the fuck you needed to. It is so beyond gross that your father would not only read it, but inflict harm on your half-siblings by letting them read it, as well as hold you accountable for the way you expressed your grief at the loss of a parent AS A CHILD. I hope you know you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. You deserve much better treatment.", "Make your exit plan. When youre of age and have a new living situstion lined up, give your dad notice.", "God no, I just don\u2019t waste peoples time and use therapy like I should. If they didn\u2019t wanna go. That\u2019s fair,   someone who actually wanted help could\u2019ve used that time. Genuinely asking is it fair for the half siblings to be punished just because they\u2019re half siblings.?", "It's also the opposite of what the dad said he wanted. Dad made it even more difficult for the family to bond.", "Honestly getting therapy with someone of OPs choice to help them deal with the abusive situation might not be a bad idea. It's not therapy's fault the dad is abusive and going did help. The fact that the dad just blew the entire family apart with this is mind boggling to me.", "I Support that. They cannot be trusted.", "> make a plan to make out ASAP.\n\nI assume you meant to write \"move out\".", "I wouldn't say therapy is out of the question. The problem here is OP's father has ruined any trust they had.", "I don't think kids finding the diary was unintentional.", "Forcing OP into therapy with specific behavioral goals that he laid out from the beginning. \n\nI don't know how actively malicious the dad is, but I'm getting major controlling and manipulative vibes from what OP describes of his actions. What a sleaze.", "I am no longer seeing the therapist. Haven't been his patient for like 3 years.", "I haven't been in therapy for like 3 years. Don't really want to go back right now either.", "God my mum went through the trash too because she was obsessed with recycling and thought nobody but her could do it correctly. If I had to throw some things away unnoticed I had to bring them out of the apartment.", "That isn't normal. Looks like you had to learn the hard way too buy OP has enough going on without being blamed for his dad's paranoia.", "Well, he was not thinking about you, that's obvious. But this is also damaging to your half-siblings. OfC you're closer to your full siblings but maybe you could have had an OK friendly relation to the half-siblings. Letting them read your notes and guilt-tripping you about it destroys any hope of that.\n\nIt's very compassionate of you to say you don't want to involve others, but perhaps your grandparents or other family would actually like to have a say?\n\nNTA, of course.", "I know this may seem extreme for some, but I would go NC with him. Just keep in touch with your siblings that you care about.", "I'm petty.  I'd also print this thread and leave it behind for him to find when you're gone.", "Yes. Spell check sucks.", "Ah I see, I misunderstood that you saw him for three years and that it ended recently.. was it only recently then that he read your diary or is this an issue from 3 years ago? Honestly even if you haven\u2019t seen the therapist in three years, it might be worth a try to still call them. \n\nOr better yet, convince your dad to bring the whole family to a new (family)therapist and talk about that situation, because this is not something that can just be left like it is imo", "That's part of the worst of this for me. You wrote those things years ago. He's acting as if you wrote them yesterday. Its an insane breach of trust to read it. Pure stupid to have allowed step siblings to read it. Down right unfair to pretend like you wrote them this week.", "I understand. I meant only if one would serve as your ally, someone in your corner who could help you plan for your future in a self respectful way, since your father feels you are not due any basic human respect.\n\n\nAt the same time, finding a good therapist can be a pain in the ass so I understand why you don't want to.\n\n\nTry to find allies in your life who will support you and respect you to balance out what you're dealing with. People to help you plan for your future and emphasize how worthy you are of good things, respect, support, unconditional love. Never forget that!", "I'm so sorry you are going through this. I genuinely hope this doesn't result in you feeling bad for how you feel, that's not healthy in the long run. \n\nIt's okay to want your mom back and the life you had with her. It's okay not to feel the same about your half siblings. Feelings are feelings, the best thing you can do is accept them and process why you feel that way. \n\nIt sounds like you've done a great job of working on yourself and not treating your half siblings differently (or at least trying to). \n\nHopefully your grandparents or someone else positive in your life is willing to step up and let you live with them while you get on your feet. It sounds like, with the work you've already done, you'll be in a much better place than many young adults.", "Yes, he is making you feel bad and making you feel ashamed and embarrassed. Not sure if that's going to warm you up to the step-family or make you miss your mom any less. He's the expert in psychology i guess.", "Honey I have read a bunch of your replies and just want to say what an incredible young man you seem to be. You're obviously very upset but are processing these huge emotions rather than jumping straight to rage. You're a lot more emotionally mature than many adults on this sub. You should be super proud of yourself. \n\nPlease don't let this put you off therapy. Remember it's not the therapist or the therapy process who hurt you, it's your asshole of a parent who couldn't respect you and your right to privacy. Being betrayed by a parent is tremendously hurtful and if one day you want to talk to someone about it, therapy is always there. You can ask to use their office shredder if you're worried about people reading your thoughts. \n\nI am so sorry this happened to you. You had the right idea about therapy. You clearly got something out of it. Your dad doesn't understand what therapy is for and will always be wrong about this.", "So when you say \"half siblings\" you mean children your father had with your step mother, not her children from a different relationship ( husband or bf) right?", "Can't blame tech for that one, that was a You-mistake. An amusing one, granted!", "He read the diary a few weeks ago, so he held it for 3 years and then decided to read it.", "Might be a tech mistake. I've had autocorrect make some pretty bizarre substitutions on me .", "You are probably right. I'm not good with writing and reading. I swear the words jump over the page and I misread things.", "What the fuck , that makes it even worse", "Same! It also doesn't help I write in English and Spanish all the time, but the worst offences were same-language corrections.", "Re-reading something before posting doesn't require technology, it takes consideration for your readers. I make loads of typos and sometimes fight with auto-corrupt. I like spell check wiggly lines, but I don't trust them to be complete. They won't catch a wrong but validly spelled word ..\n\nI am less militant than this comment might sound though!", "No worries - humans make errors and it was a Reddit comment, not a post. I only took issue with you blaming technology rather than you making a human error. At least blame a pet!", "Yeah, for me it doesn't help that I practice French, German and Japanese in addition to English, but you're absolutely right that the most bizarre substitutions are always same language.", "Catching that takes not having ADHD."]}
