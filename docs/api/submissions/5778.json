Did you tell your husband you did not want to hear another damned word about it until he returned all his gifts, gave you the money, and took total responsibility for the girls for a day while you went and spent it on something you like? \n\nNo? Then you have nothing to apologize for. And you are not at a stalemate; your husband has asked you to do something you are not going to do. That's fine. Because this is not going to stop. They are going to keep calling you \"mama\" and buying you mother-themed gifts, deliberately to annoy you now. I bet everything they buy you is pink, too, isn't it? \n\nI think you are just going to have to call everyone in your husband's family Mommy or Daddy from now on. Including your husband. In public.

It is after all fair, you are Mama, the queen of the house, rules and authority goes along with the title.", "NAH.  You don\u2019t need to apologize for your feelings.

Like have you ever said you wouldn't like matching outfits? Do your SILs do things like that? They may have assumed you would enjoy it too. The concern that SIL2 and 3 didn't sound fake either, but I'm assuming you hate them too.", "I read the responses that are saying you're NTA and they all seem reasonable but reading your post I can't help but think YTA. A name doesn't have to be a limit, much less a nick name. Being called Little John didn't actually make him little, and he, according to legend, was not little. \n\nYour family seems to be impressed by how good of a mother you are and seem to want to highlight that about you. That doesn't seem demeaning at all, quite the opposite. Being a mother is in fact the most important thing you're ever going to do. Your family is highlighting how good you are at doing the most important thing a human can do, so to me it makes sense that they're a little confused by how you respond to them. When I got to the part where your SIL looked at you crazy when you asked her not to call you mama I totally understood what you were saying but I could also see why she would look at you crazy too. To her, calling you mama doesn't limit you but more so compliments you and for you to take that negatively would be confusing from someone who can't see where your coming from. \n\nMaybe to me you just sorta sound egotistical, which isn't always bad, but the idea that you are more than a mother almost seems to demean the importance of being a mother. It sounds like you just want to be seen as your full self and not just the barer of your children and you're NTA for that at all. But the perspective of \"I don't really care about your cycling class or your new hobby, I really just love your beautiful children and I'm blown away by how good of a mother you are\" doesn't necessarily seem demeaning either. \n\nSorry you're feeling this way though and I hope you're able to find some reconciliation. Your family just seems like some really sweet, charming people, if not a little dense.", "NTA but\u2026 in some families this is a term of endearment, it is a compliment and acceptance. Rejection could cause tension. You are not alone. Traditions have an emotional basis and you may not be readily understood.\n\nMarriage is the melding of at least two family cultures and navigating the waters requires understanding and communication.\n\nBest of luck in the new year.", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH. They should not reduce you down to only being a mom, especially after you\u2019ve asked them to stop. However, you never explained to them why what they were doing bothered you until you basically exploded. Seems like your MIL understood just fine and apologized, seems like your SILs were defensive in response to your explosion. \n\nWhat is concerning is how you speak/write with total anger about being associated with being a mom. Maybe you are just frustrated, but if you are struggling with your own identity and finding it hard to want to be a mom, and spending one weekend with your in-laws sets you completely over the top, it may be time to actually (not sarcastically or fake) seek some outside help/therapy.\n\nEta: the reason they are treating you this way is because it is normal to them. Do you find yourself getting annoyed with other people associating you as a mom? Does it happen every time someone associates you with mom things or just with your ILs?", "It doesn\u2019t sound like they were being malicious or mean about it, it also sounds like they listen to you when you did speak up.  I would have to see the dynamic to make a decision about AH I think.  Leaning towards exploding on them is AHish when simply explaining to them why you don\u2019t want to be called momma like you did with us in this post would have been far more effective than what you did.", "Mama needs a vacation.", "ESH.\n\nIt's just weird. I only refer to mother as \"mama\" when I talk to their children, like \"did you show it to (your) mama/mommy ?\". \n\nBut your eldest is 4.

I was like, \u201cso do my girls.\u201d One of my kids picked up an extra hockey stick and ran out into the street to play with the neighbor kid in her little dress. I mean\u2026 kids are kids.", "Why does any adult have to sit at the kids table? I'm so confused", "When my brother took up golf our family overwhelmed him with golf stuff for a few years. No one played golf in our family and we were all impressed that he was trying to learn. He actually announced at Thanksgiving dinner a few years later that he had all the golf stuff he needed but he liked to fish as well. This got all the guys in the family to get their fishing boxes out and load him down with all the lures that don't work for them. Lol", "You are not the Ah\u2026if you don\u2019t want to be called mama then your have the right to express that. If you aren't in favor of all the mama gifts you have the right to explain that\u2026BUT\u2026.yes there is a but\u2026doing it at a family Christmas would not be my first choice for creating drama and making an issue about it. You could have tackled that afterwards, perhaps one on one or at a family dinner after Xmas. Just my thoughts here. But since it's done, I'm not sure about apologizing\u2026if you need to, just apologize for the timing, not the message. You've made your feelings clear, I home that changes things for you in the future.", "My ex used to call me mom. I said if he ever wanted to have sex with me again hed better start calling me by my name", "No, but I do think you\u2019re taking the anger a bit far. Are they concerned that you almost sound resentful of the title and role? Because that\u2019s how I was when my PPD was at its worst, I snapped at a nurse to call me my name.", "NTA, unless you are very insular about your interests and personality.  I get put in a tight spot every Christmas when buying my dad and stepmother things,  because my dad has very transparent interests,  and my stepmother does not. I think your complaints are fair though, I'm pretty conservative and even I felt bad when the only gifts I could think of for my stepmother revolved around her 1 year old baby.", "Honestly. I guarantee that the point you're trying to convey is lost on them... You obviously do not share their values either, so in the end, you will be seen as the asshole regardless. This may be innocent/unintentional. Or...\n\nI'd assume they do not like you and prefer only to acknowledge you based on the one thing they perceive positively. Creating your child.", "So i hope you will be petty for his birthday... i heart he wants a child carrier or something else child related \ud83d\ude05", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen Bad Sisters (a dark comedy series from Ireland), but, the main character (who you hate more and more as the series goes on) calls the wife he consistently mentally abuses \u201cmami,\u201d and, this whole conversation just reminds me of that and makes me retch.\n\nDo watch this show. It\u2019s fantastic.", "And make sure you pay for it from the joint account, if you have one. If hubby asks, what was this charge? Tell him, \"I went and got myself a proper Xmas gift.\"", "Right? If I didn't birth you don't call me mama", "I think she's likely a whole lot of other things as well... her inlaws are already reducing her to only being something because of her relation to someone else ( her kids)  so as outsiders,  we should probably avoid doing that exact same thing.\nFor example, she could be a reader, or musician, or a gardener, or hiker, or painter, or a shower-singer, or an enjoyer-of comedy, or a theatre-goer, or cat-lover, or, or, or", "lol I swear we have the exact same step cousin. I guess they really are a dime a dozen."]}
