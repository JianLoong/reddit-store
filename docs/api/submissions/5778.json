Did you tell MIL that if she is so excited about being a grandmother she better start showing a little respect to her grandchildren's mother? Did you tell your husband you did not want to hear another damned word about it until he returned all his gifts, gave you the money, and took total responsibility for the girls for a day while you went and spent it on something you like? \n\nNo? Then you have nothing to apologize for. And you are not at a stalemate; your husband has asked you to do something you are not going to do. That's fine. Because this is not going to stop. They are going to keep calling you \"mama\" and buying you mother-themed gifts, deliberately to annoy you now. I bet everything they buy you is pink, too, isn't it? \n\nI think you are just going to have to call everyone in your husband's family Mommy or Daddy from now on. Including your husband. In public.

It is after all fair, you are Mama, the queen of the house, rules and authority goes along with the title.", "NAH.  You don\u2019t need to apologize for your feelings.

Like have you ever said you wouldn't like matching outfits? Do your SILs do things like that? They may have assumed you would enjoy it too. The concern that SIL2 and 3 didn't sound fake either, but I'm assuming you hate them too.", "I read the responses that are saying you're NTA and they all seem reasonable but reading your post I can't help but think YTA. A name doesn't have to be a limit, much less a nick name. Being called Little John didn't actually make him little, and he, according to legend, was not little. \n\nYour family seems to be impressed by how good of a mother you are and seem to want to highlight that about you. That doesn't seem demeaning at all, quite the opposite. Being a mother is in fact the most important thing you're ever going to do. Your family is highlighting how good you are at doing the most important thing a human can do, so to me it makes sense that they're a little confused by how you respond to them. When I got to the part where your SIL looked at you crazy when you asked her not to call you mama I totally understood what you were saying but I could also see why she would look at you crazy too. To her, calling you mama doesn't limit you but more so compliments you and for you to take that negatively would be confusing from someone who can't see where your coming from. \n\nMaybe to me you just sorta sound egotistical, which isn't always bad, but the idea that you are more than a mother almost seems to demean the importance of being a mother. It sounds like you just want to be seen as your full self and not just the barer of your children and you're NTA for that at all. But the perspective of \"I don't really care about your cycling class or your new hobby, I really just love your beautiful children and I'm blown away by how good of a mother you are\" doesn't necessarily seem demeaning either. \n\nSorry you're feeling this way though and I hope you're able to find some reconciliation. Your family just seems like some really sweet, charming people, if not a little dense.", "NTA but\u2026 in some families this is a term of endearment, it is a compliment and acceptance. Rejection could cause tension. You are not alone. Traditions have an emotional basis and you may not be readily understood.\n\nMarriage is the melding of at least two family cultures and navigating the waters requires understanding and communication.\n\nBest of luck in the new year.", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH. They should not reduce you down to only being a mom, especially after you\u2019ve asked them to stop. However, you never explained to them why what they were doing bothered you until you basically exploded. Seems like your MIL understood just fine and apologized, seems like your SILs were defensive in response to your explosion. \n\nWhat is concerning is how you speak/write with total anger about being associated with being a mom. Maybe you are just frustrated, but if you are struggling with your own identity and finding it hard to want to be a mom, and spending one weekend with your in-laws sets you completely over the top, it may be time to actually (not sarcastically or fake) seek some outside help/therapy.\n\nEta: the reason they are treating you this way is because it is normal to them. Do you find yourself getting annoyed with other people associating you as a mom? Does it happen every time someone associates you with mom things or just with your ILs?", "It doesn\u2019t sound like they were being malicious or mean about it, it also sounds like they listen to you when you did speak up.  I would have to see the dynamic to make a decision about AH I think.  Leaning towards exploding on them is AHish when simply explaining to them why you don\u2019t want to be called momma like you did with us in this post would have been far more effective than what you did.", "Mama needs a vacation.", "ESH.\n\nIt's just weird. I only refer to mother as \"mama\" when I talk to their children, like \"did you show it to (your) mama/mommy ?\". \n\nBut your eldest is 4.

She's not the only one either.
