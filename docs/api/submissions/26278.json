After college we both moved back home so we could live at home and get our feet underneath us.  Alex started dating Stella (35F), a lovely girl, around 4.5 years ago, and from the get go she seemed to politely dislike me, idk why, oh well c'est la vie.  Alex and Stella moved across the country in 2021 after Stella earned a promotion at work,  In 2022 Alex proposed, she said yes, and they set a wedding date for the end of September 2023.  \n\nI got a save the date card at the beginning of the year, and based on the conversations I had with Alex assumed I would be in the wedding party, either as a groomsman or the best man, but never received any official confirmation from either of them.  Couple months before the wedding I saw that wedding invitations had gone out on social media, and figured mine was on route.  It never came.   I waited a couple weeks, figured it might have just gotten lost in the mail, before I checked in with him.\n\nI called Alex and had a brief conversation with him where he was clearly agitated and said he was dealing with a lot, would be incommunicado for the near future, to direct any wedding related questions to Stella, and he'd called me when things cooled off.  I called, texted, and emailed Stella several times over the course of a week but she didn't respond to any of them.  At this point I figured I wouldn't be attending the wedding, and that things were really fucked up for some reason between the two of us.  \n\nYesterday, a little over three weeks after our last conversation, Alex dm'd asking if I was free to chat.  I jumped at the opportunity to get some answers, and after exchanging pleasantries Alex jumped right into a spiel saying that he knew I was super busy with work and dealing with a lot of personal stuff but he'd love it if it could attend his wedding, even just as a guest, and wanted to know if there was anything he could do to help make that happen.  I just blurted out that I's love to but hadn't received an invitation.  Alex stared blankly at me and said \"what?\", and i just kinda verbal vomited out that I hadn't received an invitation, that was the reason I'd called him a few weeks ago, that I'd contacted Stella about it but she never got back too me and left me on read, and that I had not idea what he was talking about me dealing with too much to be involved in the wedding.  After a very pregnant pause, he said he needed to go sort things out, and that he'd call me when it was done.  \n\nMy phones blowing tf up since with wedding attendees asking me wtf happened and why the wedding might be off now.  My girlfriend has reaffirmed to me that I did nothing wrong, but I've had people from all sides saying I stuck my nose where it didn't belong, and caused a stink, which is really fucking with my head.

In your case, Alex wanted to invite you but Stella said oh he's not sure he can come, he's  swamped with work, etc, etc. When in reality you weren't even invited.\n\nIf everything's blown up, it's because Alex found out the truth about Stella, what she did and what she's really like.

She doesn't have to like you, but she is a fool if she thinks that it wasn't going to come out that she actively tried to keep you away from the wedding. My best guess is that Stella probably lied that you declined and hoped that Alex would find out until after the wedding and it would be too late (as though divorce or annulment don't exist). If the wedding is called off, you may have helped Alex dodge a bullet.", "NTA at all! You did nothing wrong, and your friend needed to know that his fianc\u00e9 was going behind his back.", "NTA you legit told him the truth. Unfortunately for her that's not something he accepts. You did nothing wrong and I would block any attendees trying to contact you with nonsense. Expect a message from the girl at some point.", "NTA. \n\nIf the wedding is ruined because she somehow intercepted the wedding of one of his guests, that isn't your fault for telling him this.", "NTA. This girl was obviously lying to Alex, and that's not a good way to start a marriage anyway.", "NTA\n\nWhat were you supposed to do...? Keep up a lie you didn't know had occurred? Even if you knew she lied you're 100% in the right to ask why you were not invited to your best friends wedding (without his knowledge!) and seeing as you didn't even know that much, were you supposed to simply guess and say \"c'est la vie\" to a lifelong friendship??", "NTA, the bride got caught being a word that would not be necessarily appropriate to say. You were honest with your friend and that's that.", "NTA. You were just honest and honorable. It looks like Stella was pulling strings to get you out of the picture. All you did was explain what had happened (or not happened) from your side. YOU DID NOTHING WRONG. Ignore the chorus of criticizers--listen to your girlfriend!", "NTA. Good thing he found out now what she\u2019s like. Who the hell are these people saying you stuck your nose in? No you didn\u2019t you corrected him and told him what had happened! Listen to your girlfriend.", "Nta, I am curious if they go through with the wedding or not, please update!", "Pregnant pause \ud83d\ude02 i don't know if that is an expression or a typo, but I found it funny.\n\nAnyway, NTA. How come telling the truth is stucking your nose where you don't belong? You had no idea what was going on, you literally just told your friend the facts.
