For the past month I've been traveling for work so my mom has been looking after my little fur ball.  Unfortunately we've come to realize that our cats don't get along and the environment in her apartment is tense between them.  Both of the cats are stressed but are generally at a bit of a truce as they've moved to their own spaces in the house and stay there.  I have no choice but to leave her there for a couple more weeks as its too late to make other arrangements, but decided in the future when I have to travel I will find a way to bring her with me or leave her elsewhere to prevent stress on our cats.\n\nMy sister's cat is 22 years old.  Yesterday she called me and told me that she was going to bring her cat to Christmas.  I responded no, she can't do that because that will do nothing but stress all of our cats out more and she'll only be gone for a night.  She got SUPER upset but I asked her if she seriously thought that her old cat would be less stressed in a house full of cats that hate each other rather than spending a single night alone in her own bed.  Note that my sister would leave this cat alone for days at a time when she went backpacking with her boyfriend last year.  Also keep in mind that my sister let this cat go with an eye infection for like 3 months last year and it didn't get treated until I took a day off, picked up her cat myself, and took her to the vet because I actually DO care about her cat.  And I work like 70 hours a week. \n\nShe ended up absolutely freaking the fuck out, telling me that she deserves to be at Christmas as much as I do and that her cat deserves to be there as much as mine.  My cat is literally living there right now... if she didn't have to be there she wouldn't. I went to bed and she texted me for several hours a bunch of nasty shit and then she BLACKMAILED me lmao \n\nI literally never said she shouldn't be at Christmas, just that she should leave her cat at home for the night because the 2 cats already in the house are feeling stressed and there is literally no reason to add a third to the mix.

Like the cat doesn't understand the meaning of Christmas.  All the cat is going to do is be stressed out.  At 22 the stress could kill the cat.  It's not going to be a picture perfect moment like she's imagining it.  It's going to be a disaster.", "NTA. Most cats do not even want to travel with their owners.

Your sister sounds like a real piece of work. Tell her that if she brings the cat, all consequences fall on her. If she agrees to not bring it and throws a tantrum then just out her about all the neglect with her cat and see if sense gets in her head. If neither work then just straight up uninvite her. You said she blackmailed you and said a bunch of nasty shit over the cat... to me that's just pathetic and childish and a straight up no.

Respect what is best for the cat on home turf. If it's one night and sisters cat has been left alone before, that also sounds best for that cat too. Sounds like sister is entitled and trying to do a power move. Blackmailing is also crazy and I would consider disinviting her too, although that would certainly cause more drama.

Bringing another cat into an already stressed group of animals is frankly dumb and endangers all of them.\n\nThat said, it's your MOM'S house. She needed to be the one to decide what was allowed", "NTA. Honestly I'm surprised she's kept a cat going to 22.", "Info: What has your mom said about your sisters cat coming to Christmas, after all, it is your mom's apartment, right?  She's allowing your cat to stay there, so, wouldn't it be your mother's decision on whether your sister is allowed to bring the cat, not yours?", "Lol!! I used to do some crazy stuff in my early 20s that I obviously didn't tell my mom about because she doesn't need to know.  Im not ashamed of it, I went though a phase and was having fun and I've grown out of it.  Im staying at my mom's until Christmas so this morning I just told her that my sister is blackmailing me with some stuff I didnt want her to know, so if she hears some stuff thats why.  My mom's pissed about it and doesn't wanna know lol", "No it definitely has to do with the cat, youre overestimating my sister's level of sanity.", "It's a 1 bedroom apartment that already has 2 cats in it.", "The cat is a total trooper.  Im convinced she'd survive through the apocalypse", "Yeah don't do this. Stand firm on 'no' and let her have a tantrum.   \nCaving now will teach her that this behaviour is acceptable and will get her what she wants.   \n\n\nAdults who act like children should be treated as such IMO.", "NTA. An older cat tends to like their own territory plus if there are already two cats at odds at your mom\u2019s place why would you add to that situation?", "YTA\u2026because your sister is not coming to your house, but your parents and it is their choice to let her cat come or not.  Sheesh, who in the world takes their dogs everywhere let alone cats?!  Never heard of taking cats on field trips.  Although, there are those who travel well.  Although, I do agree with you in that a 22 year old cat would be best kept at home for a night.  As for you, pet sitter is your best bet for future travel.  Come in once a day to change litter, check food and water.", "YTA not only is it not your place so you don\u2019t get to make the decision, you are also a hypocrite since your cat is there as well. Anyone with a bit of common sense knows that cats that do not know each other well will not get along in anyway. You set the precedent by taking your cat.", "NTA. I've had cats my whole life and her negligent behavior of this one is keeping me simultaneously horrified and in awe that she can still keep a cat alive to the ripe old age of 22. I would never leave my cat alone, even for a whole night, but I baby her and we have meds to deal with etc. But I also wouldn't take her with me, holy shit. I'd call our pet sitter. How does she not have a pet sitter?? \n\nBut since she's willing to blackmail you, you have to know this won't be the last time. Time to get ahead of this. How bad is whatever she has on you? Can you just rip off the bandaid and get ahead of it so she loses her leverage?", "NTA\n\nThat cat shouldn't be traveling anyway", "NTA.  She isn't thinking about what's best for the cats. A 22 year old cat shouldn't be stressed out that much.", "NTA, I'll be going to my mums for a 1 night stay over Christmas. Our cats are not coming they will be fed when we go. My dad is driving me through to feed them on the evening. Her idea will cause her cat so much stress.", "INFO: is Christmas at your house or your moms?", "ESH. Not your house not your call (but the blackmailing is seriously a bit much on her end) and you may not know her cat's daily needs (see below for my own cat as an example) but from the sounds of it I'm not sure she does either. It's deeply concerning about her leaving the cat with an eye infection for that long. \n\nAnd for all you Redditors saying you can leave the cat alone for a night, god I miss those days. I love my little fur demon but I can't leave her alone for my than 12 hours now that she's hit 14 (15?). She used to be on an auto feeder due to food addiction, then after a kidney scare last year vets prescribed wet food and when she gets left alone too long she tends to induce vet visits since that typically means she's not fed on schedule. I think she mostly does it out of spite and she does quite like her vet. So yes cat's can be highly independent (when that auto feeder program was running she was also toilet trained too so no litter box), but not all cats remain that way in old age.", "NTA, Cats are SOOOOO territorial. having an unfamiliar cat in their space is going to end up getting one of them hurt pretty badly, if not spraying etc.", "I will take my older cat w me to my parents. With that, she loves car rides and my parents spoil her rotten when she is there. She wound up staying w them for 2 weeks when I had to move and was changing jobs.

My youngest would shiv someone if he thought he'd get a treat out of it.", "Is your mom aware of the situation? Is she agreeing with you about not allowing your sister to bring her cat?", "It\u2019s as Dan Savages mother used to say: there are some things a parent has a right NOT to know", "Your cat is only there because you failed to make adequate arrangements. You forced your cat and your mothers into a stressful situation that could have been avoided. You are at fault for that.", "My mother offered to watch my cat.  I didnt force her into anything."]}
