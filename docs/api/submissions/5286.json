Yesterday she called me and told me that she was going to bring her cat to Christmas.  I responded no, she can't do that because that will do nothing but stress all of our cats out more and she'll only be gone for a night.  She got SUPER upset but I asked her if she seriously thought that her old cat would be less stressed in a house full of cats that hate each other rather than spending a single night alone in her own bed.  Note that my sister would leave this cat alone for days at a time when she went backpacking with her boyfriend last year.  Also keep in mind that my sister let this cat go with an eye infection for like 3 months last year and it didn't get treated until I took a day off, picked up her cat myself, and took her to the vet because I actually DO care about her cat.

My cat is literally living there right now... if she didn't have to be there she wouldn't. I went to bed and she texted me for several hours a bunch of nasty shit and then she BLACKMAILED me lmao \n\nI literally never said she shouldn't be at Christmas, just that she should leave her cat at home for the night because the 2 cats already in the house are feeling stressed and there is literally no reason to add a third to the mix.

She's allowing your cat to stay there, so, wouldn't it be your mother's decision on whether your sister is allowed to bring the cat, not yours?", "Lol!! I used to do some crazy stuff in my early 20s that I obviously didn't tell my mom about because she doesn't need to know.  Im not ashamed of it, I went though a phase and was having fun and I've grown out of it.  Im staying at my mom's until Christmas so this morning I just told her that my sister is blackmailing me with some stuff I didnt want her to know, so if she hears some stuff thats why.

Stand firm on 'no' and let her have a tantrum.   \nCaving now will teach her that this behaviour is acceptable and will get her what she wants.   \n\n\nAdults who act like children should be treated as such IMO.", "NTA. An older cat tends to like their own territory plus if there are already two cats at odds at your mom\u2019s place why would you add to that situation?", "YTA\u2026because your sister is not coming to your house, but your parents and it is their choice to let her cat come or not.  Sheesh, who in the world takes their dogs everywhere let alone cats?!  Never heard of taking cats on field trips.  Although, there are those who travel well.  Although, I do agree with you in that a 22 year old cat would be best kept at home for a night.  As for you, pet sitter is your best bet for future travel.  Come in once a day to change litter, check food and water.", "YTA not only is it not your place so you don\u2019t get to make the decision, you are also a hypocrite since your cat is there as well. Anyone with a bit of common sense knows that cats that do not know each other well will not get along in anyway. You set the precedent by taking your cat.", "NTA. I've had cats my whole life and her negligent behavior of this one is keeping me simultaneously horrified and in awe that she can still keep a cat alive to the ripe old age of 22. I would never leave my cat alone, even for a whole night, but I baby her and we have meds to deal with etc. But I also wouldn't take her with me, holy shit. I'd call our pet sitter. How does she not have a pet sitter?? \n\nBut since she's willing to blackmail you, you have to know this won't be the last time. Time to get ahead of this. How bad is whatever she has on you? Can you just rip off the bandaid and get ahead of it so she loses her leverage?", "NTA\n\nThat cat shouldn't be traveling anyway", "NTA.  She isn't thinking about what's best for the cats. A 22 year old cat shouldn't be stressed out that much.", "NTA, I'll be going to my mums for a 1 night stay over Christmas. Our cats are not coming they will be fed when we go. My dad is driving me through to feed them on the evening. Her idea will cause her cat so much stress.", "INFO: is Christmas at your house or your moms?", "ESH. Not your house not your call (but the blackmailing is seriously a bit much on her end) and you may not know her cat's daily needs (see below for my own cat as an example) but from the sounds of it I'm not sure she does either. It's deeply concerning about her leaving the cat with an eye infection for that long.\n\nAnd for all you Redditors saying you can leave the cat alone for a night, god I miss those days. I love my little fur demon but I can't leave her alone for more than 12 hours now that she's hit 14 (15?). She used to be on an auto feeder due to food addiction, then after a kidney scare last year vets prescribed wet food and when she gets left alone too long she tends to induce vet visits since that typically means she's not fed on schedule. I think she mostly does it out of spite and she does quite like her vet. So yes cats can be highly independent (when that auto feeder program was running she was also toilet trained too so no litter box, those were excellent days), but not all cats remain that way in old age.", "NTA, Cats are SOOOOO territorial. having an unfamiliar cat in their space is going to end up getting one of them hurt pretty badly, if not spraying etc.", "I will take my older cat w me to my parents. With that, she loves car rides and my parents spoil her rotten when she is there. She wound up staying w them for 2 weeks when I had to move and was changing jobs.

My youngest would shiv someone if he thought he'd get a treat out of it.", "Is your mom aware of the situation? Is she agreeing with you about not allowing your sister to bring her cat?", "It\u2019s as Dan Savages mother used to say: there are some things a parent has a right NOT to know", "Your cat is only there because you failed to make adequate arrangements. You forced your cat and your mothers into a stressful situation that could have been avoided. You are at fault for that.", "My mother offered to watch my cat.  I didnt force her into anything.", "The ONLY reason to take a cat on a one day trip is if they need medication and cannot miss a dose without negative consequences. My best friend is a petsitter with experience with elderly animals. If your sister is concerned about leaving the cat for a day, but it doesn't need medication, she needs to find a similar pet sitter. Probably too late for that this year, but something she should look into for the future. And I agree that the stress on an elderly cat could kill it, especially if it is not a good traveler. That there are already two stressed out cats in the house just multiplies the amount of stress on the 22 year old. NTA. Honestly,  if she is that concerned about leaving her cat alone, she should either shorten her trip, or skip it entirely. Yeah, it's Christmas, but how bad would she feel if something did happen? Just a thought, can she confine the cat to a single room with everything it needs and get a nanny cam to monitor it?", "NTA obviously your sister doesn\u2019t understand cats. They are territorial and have no desire to \u201chang out\u201d with other cats. It sounds as if she thinks her cat should be \u201cincluded\u201d and she\u2019s picturing a furry love fest. Trust me, the cat does not care, and it will not be a furry love fest.", "We bring one of ours with us if we can\u2019t find a sitter. She\u2019s diabetic and can only go 12 hours between insulin doses. In the summer when we take longer vacations, my MIL keeps her and spoils her rotten.", "Lol I do but only when I\u2019m asked to! Or for car rides. I have a one year old, oddly husky like, Norwegian Forrest cat and she\u2019s leash trained. I was originally asked to bring her on Christmas Eve but I ended up actually offering not to in favor of my grandmother bringing her dog. It\u2019s an absolute pain in the ass to lug her litter box around and to be frank I miss the dog\ud83e\udd23 but OPs NTA for sure. I couldn\u2019t imagine acting as though I\u2019m entitled to bring any pet to anyone else\u2019s house. SPECIFICALLY ones with other, stressed out, cats. That\u2019s wildly unreasonable and the equivalent of my 3 year old brother throwing a tantrum for not being allowed to bring my cat to his house.", "Ha. That sounds ideal for your cat. A bit of a spa visit. But for OP's sister's cat, the situation seems a bit stressful.", "so obviously this comment isn\u2019t about you", "My parents had a diabetic cat, too. They had to leave my doctoral graduation early so they could be home on time to give Turkleton his insulin. As well they should have. He was...well he wasn't a good boy, but he was ours.", "That makes sense, and your cat is very lucky to have such a caring and responsible human. It doesn't seem like that's the case here, though.", "I don\u2019t remember saying leave a cat for 7 weeks.  Her sister is only coming overnight.  As for the OP, I understand her situation right now, I meant for future.  Very few cats like to travel.  They are most comfortable in their own home.  That is why I said a pet sitter.", "Mom and Dad did an amazing job. Mom brushed her 4 times a day for 15-30 min at a time (she was newly retired).", "Dad fed her chicken before bringing her over... However, she does protest leaving their house vocally for 5-10mins ever since.", "Absolutely. And 100% would not want to put my cat in the position OP's sister's cat is in. She would be ok w meds a bit early one day and late the other to avoid that mess."]}
