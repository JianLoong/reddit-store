For the past month I've been traveling for work so my mom has been looking after my little fur ball.  Unfortunately we've come to realize that our cats don't get along and the environment in her apartment is tense between them.  Both of the cats are stressed but are generally at a bit of a truce as they've moved to their own spaces in the house and stay there.  I have no choice but to leave her there for a couple more weeks as its too late to make other arrangements, but decided in the future when I have to travel I will find a way to bring her with me or leave her elsewhere to prevent stress on our cats.\n\nMy sister's cat is 22 years old.  Yesterday she called me and told me that she was going to bring her cat to Christmas.  I responded no, she can't do that because that will do nothing but stress all of our cats out more and she'll only be gone for a night.  She got SUPER upset but I asked her if she seriously thought that her old cat would be less stressed in a house full of cats that hate each other rather than spending a single night alone in her own bed.  Note that my sister would leave this cat alone for days at a time when she went backpacking with her boyfriend last year.  Also keep in mind that my sister let this cat go with an eye infection for like 3 months last year and it didn't get treated until I took a day off, picked up her cat myself, and took her to the vet because I actually DO care about her cat.  And I work like 70 hours a week. \n\nShe ended up absolutely freaking the fuck out, telling me that she deserves to be at Christmas as much as I do and that her cat deserves to be there as much as mine.  My cat is literally living there right now... if she didn't have to be there she wouldn't. I went to bed and she texted me for several hours a bunch of nasty shit and then she BLACKMAILED me lmao \n\nI literally never said she shouldn't be at Christmas, just that she should leave her cat at home for the night because the 2 cats already in the house are feeling stressed and there is literally no reason to add a third to the mix.

Like the cat doesn't understand the meaning of Christmas.  All the cat is going to do is be stressed out.  At 22 the stress could kill the cat.  It's not going to be a picture perfect moment like she's imagining it.  It's going to be a disaster.", "NTA. Most cats do not even want to travel with their owners.

Your sister sounds like a real piece of work. Tell her that if she brings the cat, all consequences fall on her. If she agrees to not bring it and throws a tantrum then just out her about all the neglect with her cat and see if sense gets in her head. If neither work then just straight up uninvite her. You said she blackmailed you and said a bunch of nasty shit over the cat... to me that's just pathetic and childish and a straight up no.

Respect what is best for the cat on home turf. If it's one night and sisters cat has been left alone before, that also sounds best for that cat too. Sounds like sister is entitled and trying to do a power move. Blackmailing is also crazy and I would consider disinviting her too, although that would certainly cause more drama. At the very least don't let her bring her cat.", "NTA.

I used to do some crazy stuff in my early 20s that I obviously didn't tell my mom about because she doesn't need to know.  Im not ashamed of it, I went though a phase and was having fun and I've grown out of it.  Im staying at my mom's until Christmas so this morning I just told her that my sister is blackmailing me with some stuff I didnt want her to know, so if she hears some stuff thats why.  My mom's pissed about it and doesn't wanna know lol", "No it definitely has to do with the cat, youre overestimating my sister's level of sanity.", "It's a 1 bedroom apartment that already has 2 cats in it.", "The cat is a total trooper.

Stand firm on 'no' and let her have a tantrum.   \nCaving now will teach her that this behaviour is acceptable and will get her what she wants.   \n\n\nAdults who act like children should be treated as such IMO."]}
