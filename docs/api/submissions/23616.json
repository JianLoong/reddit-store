She is going through puberty and is reaching the place where she needs to wear deodorant and shower on a regular basis. It\u2019s still new to her, she told me she just started back in June.\n\nNow, my brother, Kyle (35) struggled with personal hygiene when we were younger. Our parents were neglectful and did not teach us about this kind of stuff. It lead to Kyle and I being teased often. At one point, someone put a \u201cgift\u201d in Kyle\u2019s desk\u2026it was a bar of soap with directions how to use it. Frankly, pretty traumatizing and something I know has stuck with him to this day. Because of this, Kyle has been vigilant about his children\u2019s hygiene. Which is a good thing, that\u2019s how it should be! Yet, he tends to shame his kids a lot when it comes to this stuff. Myself and his wife have talked to him about it, but he says he\u2019s just protecting his kids from going through what he did.\n\nOn Saturday, myself, my husband, our 2-year-old daughter, Kyle, his wife and their kids, including Breanna, went out for lunch. When I hugged Breanna, I realized she reeked. Total B.O. I didn\u2019t say anything, though and instead just smiled, gave her a kiss and we sat down, with her sitting between me and her father. I don\u2019t know how Kyle didn\u2019t notice it until then, maybe she had been fine at home but a long, hot car ride had changed things? Anyway, he made a face and said, loudly, \u201cBreanna, did you put on deodorant today?\u201d She got clearly embarrassed and mumbled that she forgot. Kyle sighed loudly and said \u201cYou are humming! This is disgusting!\u201d Breanna got visibly upset and was turning bright red from embarrassment. His wife told him to cut it out and said they could discuss it with her later. I rubbed Breanna\u2019s arm and whispered it was okay, sometimes we forget these things, it\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about.\n \nAt some point, Breanna raised her arms to grab something and Kyle made another face. He exclaimed \u201cSeriously, Breanna, you can\u2019t go out in public like this!\u201d Breanna looked on the verge of tears. I put an arm around her and asked \u201cHow is this solving the problem in the moment?\u201d Kyle said he was just trying to help. I told him he was no better than the people who used to bully him for how he smelled. Breanna and my nephew (14) were confused, so I told the story. Kyle got really embarrassed and was quiet for the rest of the meal. I definitely think it helped Breanna feel better.\n\nKyle later told me I overstepped my boundaries and that wasn\u2019t my story to tell. I asked how it was any different than him loudly humiliating his daughter?

He was acting like the very thing he hated growing up. Good for you for sticking it to him in front of your niece.

Kudos to you!", "For all Kyle's wanting to spare his kids what he went through, the bullying was coming from inside the house this time. \n\nShaming is not the way. Shaming shuts kids down.  \n\nI don't know if telling Kyle's story was the right thing to do.  In a perfect world, if he hadn't chosen this shaming strategy, he could have used the story to great effect himself:  'when I was your age, I had a problem with body odour and got bullied for it. I don't want people to treat you the way I was treated, because it really hurt me. That's why I'm so serious about your hygiene' type thing.\n\nBut would he ever have been able to so frank with his kid? I don't know. But you kind of took that opportunity from him. I don't think that makes you TA, but it's something to think about. I would apologise for that, at least. It wasn't your story to tell. \n\nYou weren't wrong to stick up for Breanna. Kyle needs to be more sensitive in his approach with her. He's hurting her in his attempt to help her avoid what he experienced, because he's just replacing the other potential bullies himself with those harsh, tactless comments.  He needs to be made explicitly aware of this, but he may not be receptive to it coming from you after you told his story for him against his wishes. Or he might need time to cool off first. I don't know, as I don't know your brother like you do. Maybe speak to SIL and ask her thoughts? She may have some insights unavailable to you as the sister. \n\nI hope you find the right way to approach this. \n\nSoft  y t a? Or... We need like... YBS(AL) for 'you both suck (a little).'     \n\nSlight weight in favour of your brother being soft TA, but sort of 60/40.  \n\nI can't really choose one of the available verdicts here.  Near-equal shared soft Asshole status between you and bro, is what I want to say. With SIL and niblings obviously not at all  assholes.", "The worst part of this to me is that a parent isn't supposed to treat their children like that.

He knows how traumatizing childhood bullies are and yet has become one for the very people he should protect from childhood bullies.

So important to be kind and gentle to her in that situation!", "I think he should use his own experience to connect with his children, not shame and bully them to \"protect\" them. Right now he's creating a relationship imbalance where the kids feel belittled and embarrassed.

It seems you and his wife are trying to create that open, communicative relationship. Where he's just a jerk. Maybe when things calm down he'll be open to sharing his stories.

Last year at summer camp I literally got to the point that they had to confirm they put on deodorant before I excused them to head to breakfast (along woth sunscreen and remembering water bottles). I did not go woth my troop to camp this year and the leaders who did were not the enforcement type. Every vehicle had to travel back he with all windows down and needed 2-3 days to air out.\n\nWith teens there comes a point where you feel like a broken record and honestly, it's better to be called out by family than peers. It may be embarrassing and suck, but you have to try a ton of different tactics to get it to sink in amd become routine.\n\nJust some life experience from a mom of 2 and a scout leader of around ten biys 11-18.

You ignore things that people can't fix right away.", "i\u2019m confused on why at 11 years old they are jus now being taught proper hygiene. when i was 11 i knew better then to the leave the house without showering, putting deodorant on, and making sure i smelled fine. but to each their own i guess", "Probably Kyle's reddit account", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It is extremely common for kids that age not to shower, wear deodorant, wear the same damn hoodie every day for a month\u2026  Last year my room was so bad people could smell it in the hallway at one point.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s due to not being taught proper hygiene at home, or parents who are oblivious to the fact that their \u201cbaby\u201d hit puberty, or simply the kid is choosing not to do those things. \n\nI usually stock up on travel size deodorant to provide to students who may need to keep a stick in their locker and get some air freshener plug ins because it\u2019s the only way my sense of smell stays intact.", "Depends on the kid and the family, my family never taught me about hygiene aside from brushing teeth and I was slow as hell so I was damn ripe for a couple years after puberty started", "It sounds like she\u2019s in the process of getting there is all.

Embarrassing a child clearly isnt the same thing as doing so to an adult.
