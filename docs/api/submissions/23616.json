She is going through puberty and is reaching the place where she needs to wear deodorant and shower on a regular basis. It\u2019s still new to her, she told me she just started back in June.\n\nNow, my brother, Kyle (35) struggled with personal hygiene when we were younger. Our parents were neglectful and did not teach us about this kind of stuff. It lead to Kyle and I being teased often. At one point, someone put a \u201cgift\u201d in Kyle\u2019s desk\u2026it was a bar of soap with directions how to use it. Frankly, pretty traumatizing and something I know has stuck with him to this day. Because of this, Kyle has been vigilant about his children\u2019s hygiene. Which is a good thing, that\u2019s how it should be! Yet, he tends to shame his kids a lot when it comes to this stuff. Myself and his wife have talked to him about it, but he says he\u2019s just protecting his kids from going through what he did.\n\nOn Saturday, myself, my husband, our 2-year-old daughter, Kyle, his wife and their kids, including Breanna, went out for lunch. When I hugged Breanna, I realized she reeked. Total B.O. I didn\u2019t say anything, though and instead just smiled, gave her a kiss and we sat down, with her sitting between me and her father. I don\u2019t know how Kyle didn\u2019t notice it until then, maybe she had been fine at home but a long, hot car ride had changed things? Anyway, he made a face and said, loudly, \u201cBreanna, did you put on deodorant today?\u201d She got clearly embarrassed and mumbled that she forgot. Kyle sighed loudly and said \u201cYou are humming! This is disgusting!\u201d Breanna got visibly upset and was turning bright red from embarrassment. His wife told him to cut it out and said they could discuss it with her later. I rubbed Breanna\u2019s arm and whispered it was okay, sometimes we forget these things, it\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about.\n \nAt some point, Breanna raised her arms to grab something and Kyle made another face. He exclaimed \u201cSeriously, Breanna, you can\u2019t go out in public like this!\u201d Breanna looked on the verge of tears. I put an arm around her and asked \u201cHow is this solving the problem in the moment?\u201d Kyle said he was just trying to help. I told him he was no better than the people who used to bully him for how he smelled. Breanna and my nephew (14) were confused, so I told the story. Kyle got really embarrassed and was quiet for the rest of the meal. I definitely think it helped Breanna feel better.\n\nKyle later told me I overstepped my boundaries and that wasn\u2019t my story to tell. I asked how it was any different than him loudly humiliating his daughter? My husband thinks I wasn\u2019t wrong to stand up for Breanna, but how I went about it was bad.", "created_utc": 1690862478, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15f1kd0/aita_embarrassing_my_brother_after_he_embarrassed/", "score": 336, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What an asshole dad. he can dish it, but can't take it, like so many abusive fathers. I work with sped kids in high school and let me tell you, it gets *ripe* in there. we do give daily gentle reminders for students to bathe daily, brush their teeth and wash their faces, but its for their own sake, and we never, ever call anyone specific out. What on earth is shaming, yelling, and insulting going to do? is calling his child filthy going to apperate a shower? The only thing here that stinks is dad's attitude.", "NTA.

He was being a bully and she was clearly upset and probably traumatizing her (that age is so sensitive to things like that). I remember when I was 11 my dad made a comment that I could get a nose job when I was older if I wanted to, out of the blue (so I thought, later found out he said it reference to me banging my nose really hard on the car door and I'd been worried I'd have a bump on it). He apologized profusely but I was self concious about my nose for years afterward lol", "NTA!! i get that dad is trying to protect his child & all but humiliating and putting them through dumbass bs makes them hate the parent. Try introducing her dad ways on being encouraging on personal hygiene without being an A hole", "NTA. A good parent would kindly pull her aside and ask her if she had forgot deodorant and then would give a gentle reminder to wear it in the future. Or maybe even pull you aside discreetly and ask if she could borrow some deodorant and a fresh shirt.  You didn\u2019t overstep, you spoke the truth to protect your niece. \n(And everyone forgets deodorant sometimes!  It\u2019s not something to crucify a child over.)", "NTA. She needs to be taught and reminded to keep herself clean and smelling fresh. Not humiliated and insulted over and over. Personally I\u2019m disappointed in his wife for not doing a better job of teaching her and helping her as well. \n           He was being a bully and needed to be put in his place. He was acting like the very thing he hated growing up. Good for you for sticking it to him in front of your niece. Maybe take her on a shopping trip and let her pick out soaps that she like the smell of and get her a bathroom kit to pamper herself with. Maybe if she get to chose it will help encourage her to stay cleaner.", "NTA for speaking up. My parents did exactly what your brother did, making comments on puberty (which I was already anxious about) and pointing out things in public I can\u2019t immediately fix. Gave me terrible anxiety, low self-esteem and a warped self-image, so almost two decades later I\u2019m still working it out in therapy. He may not realize the impact what he is saying has on his daughter.", "NTA good for you. Sticking up for your niece and nephew like that. How does he not see the damage he is causing is worse since it is coming from someone that is supposed to love you!", "NTA\n\nBut pro tip, have them get the spray kind of deodorant and keep it in the glove box or trunk.  If forgets can easily do a quick fix.  It isn\u2019t perfect but better than nothing", "NTA\nHe is not \"protecting\" Breanna if he is literally doing the same bullying that was done to him. It's worse because she is getting bullied by her own father as opposed to random kids.", "NTA\n\nFuck him for trying to say you were overstepping. He\u2019s embarrassed that he got called out on his shitty behavior and is trying to make you out to be the bad guy somehow.", "NTA - If Kyle was a better parent he would have told his kids that story when he started teaching them about personal hygiene. sort of like \"I wish I had been taught this and didn't realise it was an issue until one day....\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say this as a father myself.", "NTA - it's good for the kids to know that their dad isn't just being a jerk. He could have used what you both went through as a bonding thing with his kids. But, he instead decided to do the opposite. Btw - diet can also affect how bad the problem is.", "He's not helping, he's making it worse. He needs therapy, as much as people on reddit like to suggest it.

Kudos to you!", "For all Kyle's wanting to spare his kids what he went through, the bullying was coming from inside the house this time. \n\nShaming is not the way. Shaming shuts kids down.  \n\nI don't know if telling Kyle's story was the right thing to do.  In a perfect world, if he hadn't chosen this shaming strategy, he could have used the story to great effect himself:  'when I was your age, I had a problem with body odour and got bullied for it. I don't want people to treat you the way I was treated, because it really hurt me. That's why I'm so serious about your hygiene' type thing.\n\nBut would he ever have been able to so frank with his kid? I don't know. But you kind of took that opportunity from him. I don't think that makes you TA, but it's something to think about. I would apologise for that, at least. It wasn't your story to tell. \n\nYou weren't wrong to stick up for Breanna. Kyle needs to be more sensitive in his approach with her. He's hurting her in his attempt to help her avoid what he experienced, because he's just replacing the other potential bullies himself with those harsh, tactless comments.  He needs to be made explicitly aware of this, but he may not be receptive to it coming from you after you told his story for him against his wishes. Or he might need time to cool off first. I don't know, as I don't know your brother like you do. Maybe speak to SIL and ask her thoughts? She may have some insights unavailable to you as the sister. \n\nI hope you find the right way to approach this. \n\nSoft  y t a? Or... We need like... YBS(AL) for 'you both suck (a little).'     \n\nSlight weight in favour of your brother being soft TA, but sort of 60/40.  \n\nI can't really choose one of the available verdicts here.  Near-equal shared soft Asshole status between you and bro, is what I want to say. With SIL and niblings obviously not at all  assholes.", "The worst part of this to me is that a parent isn't supposed to treat their children like that.

She forgot one time. That\u2019s what made it worse, IMO. It wouldn\u2019t be okay if she was  regularly forgetting but it was one time.", "But not in a hot climate.", "It\u2019s not a reoccurring issue. She forgot to wear deodorant once.", "Ok. Then your brother just need to be put in his place from time to time till she gets it under control all the time. She\u2019s a kid. If I got humiliated every time I forgot deodorant as an early teen.

Breanna needs some gentle guidance not complete and utter humiliation from her father.  Kyle is well out of order.  That poor girl.", "NTA. He started it.", "NAH - shaming your kid is effective in changing their behaviour. In many cases, shaming leads to psychological issues, but it's hard to see how that would apply here. People should be ashamed of poor hygiene. Your brother isn't parenting brilliantly, but nor is he crossing any lines that justify your intervention. And that story is obviously not yours to tell. But you are trying to help your niece so I wouldn't label you an AH either", "NTA. He wants to \"protect\" his kids but is being the bully himself. That's messed up.", "Absolutely. Amazing how this thread is even in contest mode.", "Key word there is sped.  \n\nAs for the shaming, clearly it will make the girl more likely to remember to wash etc next time. It might not be the nicest way of doing it, but it's obviously a great deal more effective than gentle reminders.

This IS a persistent thing and his daughter is in psychological distress. You have successfully mooted your own callous argument with that caveat.", "I feel like it's the opposite. If this happened often it would likely lead to long-term psychological harm. Whereas a one off isn't going to do that but will motivate her to make sure she remembers. Not the best way of going about it, but if you have concerns with his parenting, you ought to have brought that up to him privately", "Even if it was, baby wipes and deodorant kept in the car would sort it.", "Hey man, maybe you are used to your dad beating you down every day. But normal people know it has a huge effect on children when one of the two people they are supposed to trust the most shame them in public. Piss off.", "It's not traumatic to be told that in a gentle manner. However, this dad is behaving like a teenage bully towards his own kids. He knows how traumatizing childhood bullies are and yet has become one for the very people he should protect from childhood bullies. He's even worse than the kids who bullied him, imo, cause he's a damn adult who knows what he's doing and not a kid who is still learning how to be a decent human being.", "Telling an 11 year old to shower is humiliation now apparently hahaha", "Psychological distress because her dad told her to shower?

If a child is being abused, that kid needs to be rescued and put in the hands of guardians who will care properly for them. Do you think Kyle's daughter should be taken from him? Or do you just think that his parenting style is poorly thought out and likely to result in other issues? If it's the latter, than the problem is bad parenting, not abuse. \n\nKyle is trying to help his daughter. Rather than embarrassing him by telling a story that was not his to tell, OP could have tried to explain to him privately the effects that his words have and how better to help his daughter. And there's a much greater chance that that would have resulted in a change in Kyle's parenting, rather than causing a needless argument", "And Kyle exclaimed \"you can't go out in public like that\" so what more proof that this happened in a public place does anyone need?", "My bad, I misread and thought OP was invited round for lunch", "OP mentioned that they've discussed it in the past.
