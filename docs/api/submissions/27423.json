It\u2019s about the proportions between disposable income and cost of the purchase. If you have decent income, nice cushion and live comfortably, saying no to car might indeed be controlling.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the 2 yes 1 no rule here. Maybe it\u2019s because I never shared finances and am not planning to do so. It seems to me that regarding purchasing things there should be more of a conversation and a compromise than a rigid rule. Hubby feels like new car?

Was there a discussion about this between the two of you in which you both wanted this and agreed to it? Did one of you have to be convinced? Was one of you apprehensive about this decision?\n\n2.) You have a two-yes/one-no system. You said your husband has \u201cnever been a fan of\u201d this system. That tells me you imposed this system on the marriage and he reluctantly agreed, though he didn\u2019t want to. \n\n3.) There is a significant power differential between the two of you and you seem to be exercising all of the power and authority in the marriage. Just because he has the right to veto your major purposes doesn\u2019t mean he actually gets to exercise that right\u2014if you never propose major purchases. And it sounds like you\u2019re frugal and therefore don\u2019t. \n\n4.) The money could go towards your kids. Yes, but what for? Do they lack for food, clothing, or secure shelter? Are you behind on your bills? Is there a significant amount of consumer debt you are managing? Are you saving for college? And, almost as important, is the amount you are saving for college reasonable?\n\n5.) You\u2019re telling him how he can spend \u201chis\u201d money. That\u2019s not quite fair on his part, as you are a SAHM and it is \u201cour\u201d money. At the same time, it is equally unfair to tell him \u201cno.\u201d You aren\u2019t\u2014or shouldn\u2019t be\u2014the final arbiter of what gets spent, and neither should he. Instead, you guys should be able to sit down and assess this like adults. And as you describe it, both of you are failing at this critical communication skill. \n\nAs it stands, ESH because you\u2019re being controlling and he\u2019s (potentially) acting irresponsibly. However, if your budget could reasonably support a car note and all your other needs are met (and since you didn\u2019t bring this up as a factor it\u2019s safe to say both are true), then YTA for being controlling and telling your husband \u201cno\u201d rather than discussing the options and arriving at a mutual decision.", "First, the demand for new cars has not met the supply.  With the strike, it will get worse before it gets better.

Technically sure no one \"needs\" a new car, if the old car is functional enough that keeping it on the road isn't costing more than buying a new one, but a life based *purely* on \"need\" can be completely miserable for someone who has things they do *want.*\n\nYou're basically 100% gatekeeping the money, so should consider that.  Everyone has a different definition for what is considered \"enough\" to \"afford\" something.  Some are wildly irresponsible, but some are enormously conservative.  People always vilify the wildly irresponsible, but the enormously conservative are almost always viewed as being \"smart\"\n\nI'll make it more black and white.  If all of your bills are paid.  And your debt to income ratio is healthy.  And you're on track saving for college and retirement.  And you're not going \"without\" anything.

People agreeing with you probably think \"cars are wasteful\" also, be careful of that.\n\nDoes he get to \"veto\" things?  Is there *anything* you *do* \"waste\" money on?  If so, you should lead by example and go without.  Personally I couldn't live this way at all, but he's managing so...", "YTA based on the post and followup comments.  Rationale as follows:\n\n1. You do not have a pure two yes, one no system because the husband could have vetoed it by saying no.  At some point, OP made a unilateral decision.\n2. The \"for the children\" argument is manipulative, a lot of things could be \"For the children\" such as safer cars.\n3. OP's saying no all of the time is not a replacement for a financial plan.  The family needs to see a financial planner, set budgets and things like vehicle replacement schedules.\n\nI think OP is the right intent, the way they are going about it is YTA.", "YTA, and I say this as a wife.\n\nHe is the only person with an income. He is definitely not the only person *working* since you\u2019re a SAHM. But here\u2019s the thing: he needs to be able to ENJOY some of his income. Yes, pay bills and be responsible. But geez, that\u2019s not the only reason to work. We need small joys in our lives too. If you don\u2019t \u201callow\u201d that, he will resent you. If he resents you, your relationship falls apart. Also, you cannot mask your controlling, by claiming \u201cfor the kids\u201d. That\u2019s an excuse. I\u2019d bet the kids are absolutely fine. In fact, if you don\u2019t allow hubby to enjoy some money *that he earns*, and you siphon it to kids *who didn\u2019t earn it*, you\u2019ll likely grow spoiled entitled brats. So you\u2019ve created a dysfunctional family all around. YOU WILL BE MISERABLE. Let it go.\n\nFor the record, we have four mostly grown kids now. I was a SAHM until each kid started school, then I worked until the next birth. When the youngest started school, I returned to normal a job. Then, I officially retired two years ago. My husband (of 30 yrs) is now the only source of income. He works and makes our money. I do literally everything else. When one of us wants something big (rare), we talk about it and plan for it. There\u2019s never a \u201cno\u201d, but there may sometimes be a \u201cwhen\u201d. And guess what? We are both genuinely happy and madly in love.", "This is the problem with two yes one no. Can easily be turned into a unilateral discussion.", "I don\u2019t think you are controlling- but from what I\u2019ve heard, finances are the #1 thing people fight about. I am wondering if there just might be a healthier better way to do this. A budget of money that he gets to play with that you get no say on. Won\u2019t be big enough for a new car- but will allow him to have some of the toys he wants. I understand you work hard, but he does too. And being parents doesn\u2019t mean you have to forsake all your desires. By the way\u2026 you deserve a few \u201ctoys\u201d too.", "YTA \n\nI say this with kindness. There\u2019s acting responsibly and then there acting out of fear. You are letting your anxiety about financial stability rule your life and your marriage. From your comments it sounds as though you all are managing just fine and you are only focused on \u201cwhat if that changes\u201d. While that\u2019s a great mindset, you can\u2019t let it turn into fear and let that fear run your life. Like most things in marriage, it\u2019s more about finding the middle ground rather than your way or his way. His desires to spend on fun things isn\u2019t the problem. Your desire to save isn\u2019t the problem. Those two things being so rigid that you can\u2019t see the person in front of you is the problem. \n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of the \u201cjust go to therapy\u201d answer but honestly you guys need to really get to the bottom of this.

Yes even if the frivolous, unnecessary huge purchase would \"only put your spending back a little\" or \"only mean a few less decimal points in the college fund.\" \n\nHaving kids means you no longer have the luxury of wanton spending. This isn't a little treat yourself thing like a fancy coffee or even a pricier treat like a video game, new cars cost TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars. That's not something you commit to spending just because you want it unless you're really stinking rich, and even then I'm side eying you for buying a THIRD. CAR. This man has two children. He doesn't need a mid life crisis brand new car. If he wanted full \"control\" of his money to make random large purchases whenever he felt like it, he shouldn't have chosen to have kids and a wife to support. But he did. He made his choice. Suck it up.", "Possibly YTA? I believe in moderation.  Yes, it's important to save but - the part I think is unfair is that you feel the money is better spent on the kids.  On what though? Are you referring above and beyond basic needs? Vacations? I get you feel that the money is better spent elsewhere, and you believe his wants are frivolous but not to him.  What is the point of working hard if he doesn't get a reward once in awhile?  You work hard too, but you rather spend the money on the kids - why can't it be both?  Ultimately, you are controlling because you've already deemed his wants as unimportant, so there's no way he can win.  Make an exception  once a year, let him get the car - as long as it doesn't cause the inability to not meet current financial obligations.  Otherwise I'd be bitter too.", "YTA- based on reasoning (kids first/only/ever) unless needs based.

For some people, it creates a sense of great sense of dissatisfaction and a feeling that non of their (emotional) needs are important. Never saving anything for tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be healthy, but it\u2019s not healthy to constantly be worried that tomorrow could be worse as well, and never splurge. Set apart a specific amount per month towards the big \u201cwants\u201d and then either take turns getting a big want, or if you have none, do one for him, then a family thing. \n\nOr, it sounds like you have the budgetary flexibility to increase monthly fun money, which might allow him to save for the big wants on his own. If you *could* pay for a car payment monthly, or it wouldn\u2019t be terrible to buy an $800 Star Wars Lego set financially, then you definitively have the wiggle room available. Fun budget should be based on overall budget, not the least amount of money that can be budgeted toward it. \n\nI think it\u2019s great you think of the future, but I am going with YTA, because it\u2019s clear that he really doesn\u2019t have a day.

I get it, you don\u2019t want to spend $20k. But\u2026 you said no to an office chair? To a PS5? These things do not require taking on debt.

How this looks is you put money aside every month to create a fund so that you can pay cash for a vehicle when it comes time to replace one of your current ones. I think while you\u2019re more fiscally responsible than your husband it\u2019s probable that you\u2019re too tight with your money. \n\nA compromise would look like when we have x amount of money set aside in an emergency fund, then we will increase fun money by y amount. When we have x amount of money in these sinking funds, we can increase the fun money again by z amount, etc. The caveat is that is an emergency happens that significantly wipes out the emergency fund then both partners will immediately decrease fun money until fund gets replenished.", "Or your husband could file for divorce because he\u2019s unhappy.\n\nIt sounds like you have a values disconnect, you being quite frugal and him wanting to spend, but if you don\u2019t meet in the middle then you\u2019re saying that your values and priorities are more important than his happiness, all the time.
