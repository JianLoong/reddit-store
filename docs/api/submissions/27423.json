It\u2019s about the proportions between disposable income and cost of the purchase. If you have decent income, nice cushion and live comfortably, saying no to car might indeed be controlling.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the 2 yes 1 no rule here. Maybe it\u2019s because I never shared finances and am not planning to do so. It seems to me that regarding purchasing things there should be more of a conversation and a compromise than a rigid rule. Hubby feels like new car?

Was there a discussion about this between the two of you in which you both wanted this and agreed to it? Did one of you have to be convinced? Was one of you apprehensive about this decision?\n\n2.) You have a two-yes/one-no system. You said your husband has \u201cnever been a fan of\u201d this system. That tells me you imposed this system on the marriage and he reluctantly agreed, though he didn\u2019t want to. \n\n3.) There is a significant power differential between the two of you and you seem to be exercising all of the power and authority in the marriage. Just because he has the right to veto your major purposes doesn\u2019t mean he actually gets to exercise that right\u2014if you never propose major purchases. And it sounds like you\u2019re frugal and therefore don\u2019t. \n\n4.) The money could go towards your kids. Yes, but what for? Do they lack for food, clothing, or secure shelter? Are you behind on your bills? Is there a significant amount of consumer debt you are managing? Are you saving for college? And, almost as important, is the amount you are saving for college reasonable?\n\n5.) You\u2019re telling him how he can spend \u201chis\u201d money. That\u2019s not quite fair on his part, as you are a SAHM and it is \u201cour\u201d money. At the same time, it is equally unfair to tell him \u201cno.\u201d You aren\u2019t\u2014or shouldn\u2019t be\u2014the final arbiter of what gets spent, and neither should he. Instead, you guys should be able to sit down and assess this like adults. And as you describe it, both of you are failing at this critical communication skill. \n\nAs it stands, ESH because you\u2019re being controlling and he\u2019s (potentially) acting irresponsibly. However, if your budget could reasonably support a car note and all your other needs are met (and since you didn\u2019t bring this up as a factor it\u2019s safe to say both are true), then YTA for being controlling and telling your husband \u201cno\u201d rather than discussing the options and arriving at a mutual decision.", "First, the demand for new cars has not met the supply.  With the strike, it will get worse before it gets better.

Technically sure no one \"needs\" a new car, if the old car is functional enough that keeping it on the road isn't costing more than buying a new one, but a life based *purely* on \"need\" can be completely miserable for someone who has things they do *want.*\n\nYou're basically 100% gatekeeping the money, so should consider that.  Everyone has a different definition for what is considered \"enough\" to \"afford\" something.  Some are wildly irresponsible, but some are enormously conservative.  People always vilify the wildly irresponsible, but the enormously conservative are almost always viewed as being \"smart\"\n\nI'll make it more black and white.  If all of your bills are paid.  And your debt to income ratio is healthy.  And you're on track saving for college and retirement.  And you're not going \"without\" anything.

Yeah, YTA IMO\n\nIf you guys are barely holding shit together, bills are late, under saving, and he makes like $60k, then bro needs to accept he can't afford a new car.\n\nEDIT: in the replies you say all finances are fine, and actually acknowledge that you could afford the car, you just don't want it.  People agreeing with you probably think \"cars are wasteful\" also, be careful of that.\n\nDoes he get to \"veto\" things?  Is there *anything* you *do* \"waste\" money on?  If so, you should lead by example and go without.  Personally I couldn't live this way at all, but he's managing so...", "YTA based on the post and followup comments.  Rationale as follows:\n\n1. You do not have a pure two yes, one no system because the husband could have vetoed it by saying no.  At some point, OP made a unilateral decision.\n2. The \"for the children\" argument is manipulative, a lot of things could be \"For the children\" such as safer cars.\n3. OP's saying no all of the time is not a replacement for a financial plan.  The family needs to see a financial planner, set budgets and things like vehicle replacement schedules.\n\nI think OP is the right intent, the way they are going about it is YTA.", "YTA, and I say this as a wife.\n\nHe is the only person with an income. He is definitely not the only person *working* since you\u2019re a SAHM. But here\u2019s the thing: he needs to be able to ENJOY some of his income. Yes, pay bills and be responsible. But geez, that\u2019s not the only reason to work. We need small joys in our lives too. If you don\u2019t \u201callow\u201d that, he will resent you. If he resents you, your relationship falls apart. Also, you cannot mask your controlling, by claiming \u201cfor the kids\u201d. That\u2019s an excuse. I\u2019d bet the kids are absolutely fine. In fact, if you don\u2019t allow hubby to enjoy some money *that he earns*, and you siphon it to kids *who didn\u2019t earn it*, you\u2019ll likely grow spoiled entitled brats. So you\u2019ve created a dysfunctional family all around. YOU WILL BE MISERABLE. Let it go.\n\nFor the record, we have four mostly grown kids now. I was a SAHM until each kid started school, then I worked until the next birth. When the youngest started school, I returned to normal a job. Then, I officially retired two years ago. My husband (of 30 yrs) is now the only source of income. He works and makes our money. I do literally everything else. When one of us wants something big (rare), we talk about it and plan for it. There\u2019s never a \u201cno\u201d, but there may sometimes be a \u201cwhen\u201d. And guess what? We are both genuinely happy and madly in love.", "This is the problem with two yes one no. Can easily be turned into a unilateral discussion.", "I don\u2019t think you are controlling- but from what I\u2019ve heard, finances are the #1 thing people fight about. I am wondering if there just might be a healthier better way to do this. A budget of money that he gets to play with that you get no say on. Won\u2019t be big enough for a new car- but will allow him to have some of the toys he wants. I understand you work hard, but he does too. And being parents doesn\u2019t mean you have to forsake all your desires. By the way\u2026 you deserve a few \u201ctoys\u201d too.", "YTA \n\nI say this with kindness. There\u2019s acting responsibly and then there acting out of fear. You are letting your anxiety about financial stability rule your life and your marriage. From your comments it sounds as though you all are managing just fine and you are only focused on \u201cwhat if that changes\u201d. While that\u2019s a great mindset, you can\u2019t let it turn into fear and let that fear run your life. Like most things in marriage, it\u2019s more about finding the middle ground rather than your way or his way. His desires to spend on fun things isn\u2019t the problem. Your desire to save isn\u2019t the problem. Those two things being so rigid that you can\u2019t see the person in front of you is the problem. \n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of the \u201cjust go to therapy\u201d answer but honestly you guys need to really get to the bottom of this.

Yes even if the frivolous, unnecessary huge purchase would \"only put your spending back a little\" or \"only mean a few less decimal points in the college fund.\" \n\nHaving kids means you no longer have the luxury of wanton spending. This isn't a little treat yourself thing like a fancy coffee or even a pricier treat like a video game, new cars cost TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars. That's not something you commit to spending just because you want it unless you're really stinking rich, and even then I'm side eying you for buying a THIRD. CAR. This man has two children. He doesn't need a mid life crisis brand new car. If he wanted full \"control\" of his money to make random large purchases whenever he felt like it, he shouldn't have chosen to have kids and a wife to support. But he did. He made his choice. Suck it up.", "Possibly YTA? I believe in moderation.  Yes, it's important to save but - the part I think is unfair is that you feel the money is better spent on the kids.  On what though? Are you referring above and beyond basic needs? Vacations? I get you feel that the money is better spent elsewhere, and you believe his wants are frivolous but not to him.  What is the point of working hard if he doesn't get a reward once in awhile?  You work hard too, but you rather spend the money on the kids - why can't it be both?  Ultimately, you are controlling because you've already deemed his wants as unimportant, so there's no way he can win.  Make an exception  once a year, let him get the car - as long as it doesn't cause the inability to not meet current financial obligations.  Otherwise I'd be bitter too.", "YTA- based on reasoning (kids first/only/ever) unless needs based.

For some people, it creates a sense of great sense of dissatisfaction and a feeling that non of their (emotional) needs are important. Never saving anything for tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be healthy, but it\u2019s not healthy to constantly be worried that tomorrow could be worse as well, and never splurge. Set apart a specific amount per month towards the big \u201cwants\u201d and then either take turns getting a big want, or if you have none, do one for him, then a family thing. \n\nOr, it sounds like you have the budgetary flexibility to increase monthly fun money, which might allow him to save for the big wants on his own. If you *could* pay for a car payment monthly, or it wouldn\u2019t be terrible to buy an $800 Star Wars Lego set financially, then you definitively have the wiggle room available. Fun budget should be based on overall budget, not the least amount of money that can be budgeted toward it. \n\nI think it\u2019s great you think of the future, but I am going with YTA, because it\u2019s clear that he really doesn\u2019t have a day.

Unlike you, I am single and have no need to compromise with anyone.\n\nHowever, as much as two yes/one no makes sense in theory\u2026 it seems like you say no a lot, and you don\u2019t actually ask for much. The impact is that *you* control the finances of the household \u2014 not him. And you do not seem to be responsive when your husband wants something.\n\nA new car is one thing. I get it, you don\u2019t want to spend $20k. But\u2026 you said no to an office chair? To a PS5? These things do not require taking on debt. While your husband may not NEED these things, he may still WANT these things. I agree with you on the car, to a point \u2014 I drive a beater that is almost paid off \u2014 but if my partner looked at me and said \u201cno, you can\u2019t spend $2,000 on something you want to make your life nicer\u201d when we had a full year of savings? I\u2019d be furious.\n\nIt isn\u2019t that you should allow him to do this all the time, and on the car I would hold firm \u2014 your current cars work just fine and don\u2019t have much mileage, per your other comments. But if you\u2019re really telling him he can\u2019t have a new, comfy office chair WHEN HE WORKS FROM HOME that is really bad. If you\u2019re saying he can\u2019t have a PS5 WHEN HE IS A GAMER that\u2019s really bad.\n\nHold the line when it matters (like the car) but you need to loosen the purse strings a bit. Not because you like it \u2014 but because you value him enough to let him have something he wants that will make him happy.", "Then he should be able and allowed to get some extras like the gaming system, PC and chair.\n\nHonestly, you sound like a miser.\n\nLoosen up your grip on the finances so you both can enjoy the fruits of both your labors.", "What's an example of something you wanted, that was wasteful, but were denied?\n\nThat would help me I think.\n\nIf you wanted a $30k vacation in Hawaii, and he said \"yeah nah\", then it seems balanced.\n\nIf you just naturally never want *anything* expensive, that's pretty rough.", "I don\u2019t even know how to work through a situation like this tbh.  It seems OP is calling the shots.  I wouldn\u2019t know what to do if my spouse was just unyielding on something like this\u2026I\u2019m at a loss.", "So what if you come from a family where people keep a car for 20 years.  Your husband doesn\u2019t want to keep it for 20 years, and you don\u2019t get to run the family based on what your family did.\n\nI wish my SO would tell me some crazy nonsense like this.  I\u2019d have a new car the next day.\n\nHe works, he gets to make decisions with you, not be at your whim.", "Not 20 years. Not anymore.\n\nMy dad was a millwright for GM. I used to do all my own maintenance, tune ups, oil changes, tire rotation, all of it. Those days are gone. Cars these days are as much computer as vehicle. You can't just tinker and keep your car running indefinitely. The systems are too complex. Sure you can get 10, 12 years if you take good care of things. But even at 8 years you could wake up tomorrow with a major problem that's more to repair than the car is worth.  \n\nBut it wouldn't make sense to replace the newer car with fewer miles, so unless you're okay with taking his car, you should be the one to get the new vehicle. He gets the new one next time.\n\nI do still think this is more about anxiety and loss of control vs saving for the kids if you have enough savings to last a year. Financial planner and some outside mediation is needed. You're not on the same page and that's the real problem.", "Yeah, I replaced the 25 yo Volvo when parts started dropping off and it wasn't going to pass inspection without a serious cash infusion. I bought a 10 yo Honda which is the BOMB! It's 14 years now and still looks new.\n\nBack in the 1970s and 1980s, 8 years was getting up there, in this day and age, cars typically last 20 years or longer.", "See I think it is. I replace every 5 years at the most. Everyone is different. It's why I always advocate for separate accounts for people, my wife never cares when I buy my new cars, I don't watch her spending on cigarettes that's more than car payments etc", "See this is where you become TA for me. \n\nYou can't constantly deny him because of a \"what if\" scenario.\n\nYou need to give on some situations, otherwise YES, you are being controlling.", "If suddenly becoming poor is your concern, you should get a job that brings income to your household.", "So the opposite of that argument is what Dave Ramsey calls a sinking fund. How this looks is you put money aside every month to create a fund so that you can pay cash for a vehicle when it comes time to replace one of your current ones. I think while you\u2019re more fiscally responsible than your husband it\u2019s probable that you\u2019re too tight with your money. \n\nA compromise would look like when we have x amount of money set aside in an emergency fund, then we will increase fun money by y amount. When we have x amount of money in these sinking funds, we can increase the fun money again by z amount, etc. The caveat is that is an emergency happens that significantly wipes out the emergency fund then both partners will immediately decrease fun money until fund gets replenished.", "Or your husband could file for divorce because he\u2019s unhappy.\n\nIt sounds like you have a values disconnect, you being quite frugal and him wanting to spend, but if you don\u2019t meet in the middle then you\u2019re saying that your values and priorities are more important than his happiness, all the time. That doesn\u2019t mean he should get everything his impulses want, but since none of his wants are getting satisfied there\u2019s no opportunity for balance.\n\nDecisions should also be based on specifics, not statistics. Forget about average car age and look at the car you have versus the one you could get.", "The age of the car isn't the biggest issue-  it's mileage and the condition it's in.  I have a 20 year old truck with only about 150K on it.  But I also have a 6 year old buick with 78K on it.  The Buick gets a lot more driving and won't last as long as the truck.", "I think that your rationale and method is flawed.  You need to see a financial planner and generate an agreed upon set of budgets.  Edit to add YTA, you are controlling.", "8 years is fairly old. Safety technology has advanced quite a bit. I recently went from a 2015 to a 2023 and I feel so much safer driving now.", "Tbh, she sounds like the type that would personally use something until it dies  but give everything to her kids.", "\"The Fendi bag is for holding the formula! It has more pockets!!!!\" lol\n\nAlthough I suspect the OP *really* has like *nothing* \"wasteful\" she wants in life.  She clearly feels cars are pure functionality, but it seems like she can't even grok the *concept* of a \"want\".", "I know right? It\u2019s almost like people can find a part time job that fits the hours they need.", "3 and 1? Jeez. I\u2019m not sure you need to have their entire college fund completely before you allow your husband to buy a nicer car that he actually like (and will need soon)\u2026.", "You both would. \n\nYou have a lot of \u201creasons/excuses\u201d but no solutions\u2026", "It makes sense that you take care of the kids at home when they are so young. This is for their health and safety as well as to not be working for no net gain.\n\nTo increase your earning potential, you could also look into college or uni.\n\nYou could start studying online and then have the kids in college or uni daycare when you are accepted into a program. I did this when my son was three. Worked great.\n\nTell DH that you need to save up for tuition and daycare. You might have to agree that he can get a new car to sweeten the deal.\n\nAnd how are your retirement savings? I hope you're still paying into yours while SAHM. \n\nLay it all out. Get a financial planner, if needed.\n\nWork it out. You might feel more confident; DH might realize the power of planning instead of wanting toys.\n\nESH, but I'm leaning NTA.", "He almost certainly has life and long term disability insurance through his job.", "You\u2019re right about emotions, but with the car specifically, I don\u2019t really give a shit what her husband wants \u2014 if I were her, I would die on the hill of \u201cno new cars.\u201d She is frugal, and she is correct that new cars are the single biggest unnecessary expense in most households.\n\nAnd I told her YTA.", "Yo, my first car in HS was a used 2010 civic, that car was fun. Still have it, I recently bought a new type R but my civic still runs. Granted it is heavily modded", "Dude, you should always have a nest egg if at least a few thousand if you can afford it, especially with kids. Most people are one emergency away from bankruptcy.\n\nAn $800 Lego set when you have multiple kids? That should be a common sense \"no\". If it's a yes, plan discretionary funds to set aside per week and save up, but most of what OP described is super frivolous\n\nOne of the reason my dad was able to weather his layoffs (5 different ones when I was growing up) is he always made sure there was a savings that would cover 3 months of household expenses. When my mom got in her accident, that's what he used, and he made damn sure he put it back soon as he could. \n\nNever underestimate the freedom having a savings gives you. OP is not wrong there.", "OP has explained her income would just cover childcare. \n\nIt makes no sense for her to work.", "Sometimes it\u2019s not worth it, even in the 1980\u2019s when my mum had my brother, her pay covered his daycare and the house payment, they lived on my dad\u2019s pay", "She is a SAHM, and has two kids? How exactly would the husband pull out ahead in that situation?", "This just reminds me of an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond where Ray is put in charge of the finances and realizes it's far more complicated than it seems and ends up screwing up their checkbook because he wants to buy whatever he wants. \n\nSounds like the hubby makes the money but doesn't manage it. Plus why spend money on a new car when you have perfectly functioning cars. The only time I update is if one is dead or we actually need to upgrade size for the family.\n\nAlso, I'd save that money for family vacations/experiences. Way more fun!", "They are in fine condition, they just have an older aesthetic. Do not remember the exact mileage of my car but it has a little over 60k and it is the oldest. His is most likely lower cause he drives less and has a newer car.", "The safety features have not come that far ahead.  \n\nDriving ability and awareness will trump all other safety features. My car is 15 years old, never been in an accident.", "8 years is old for a car?", "That is a good point.", "Let's be real we all know it will most likely fall on her. Say if both jobs are not flexible the husbands job will be seen as more valuable and thus should be the one that is protected. \n\nMeans the wife will be the one having to take off work.", "That's dependent on his job, though, which she said was volatile. They could get something that's not tied to his job to supplement.", "I hear you.  Personally, I hate having a car note (I don\u2019t) and kept my last car for 17 years.  I don\u2019t plan on buying a new one anytime soon.  But those are personal preferences.  I don\u2019t impose them on my SO.  I would not die in this hill unless money were an issue, and it is not for OP\u2019s family.\n\nWhat I would do is try to arrive at a compromise.  I would not expect my SO to keep a car for 20 years, and I wouldn\u2019t be crazy enough to suggest it.", "She is if she won\u2019t even increase the \u201cfun\u201d money so he has some to save to his big wants. She says they can afford to do so but she won\u2019t even consider it. She isn\u2019t willing to compromise at all\n\nEta. She\u2019s said they have college funds and enough saved to cover expenses for a year. There is definitely enough money to give the fun money a bump", "It depends on how much you make. For those of us not living in poverty or paycheque to paycheque 800 on a Lego set is a bit pricey but still fine. Especially if it\u2019s not a daily thing. It\u2019s cheaper than a lot of other hobbies.", "It still makes sense, because at tax time it\u2019s a windfall of free money for parents. Two working parents filing separately and claiming separate kids would make a killing.", "He\u2019s not the one carefully calculating finances and basing all decisions on it. Discontent at feeling controlled may become a situation that he wants to leave, whether it makes financial sense or not. Many divorces don\u2019t make financial sense and are instead about feelings.", "Yeah, those cars sound fine.  But age is kind of less of a descriptor of condition than mileage.", "I've driven cars until they're 18 and 16 years old. I'm on my third. Never had an accident, knock on wood.\n\nI get the maintenance package, rustproofing, and paint protection.\n\nAnd YEARS of not paying a monthly expense\n\nI raised kids and built up my RRSP instead. On one income.", "It can be depending on how you are about maintenance, how much driving has been done, safety and so on. 8 years you start getting to the point where the repairs outweigh the value of the car.", "Yes. It is. \n\nWell maintained, it's got some life in it yet, but you're within the realm of needing costly repairs", "I \ud83d\udcafdisagree and think you\u2019re projecting your own issues onto the OP.", "Given everything he\u2019s bought, it doesn\u2019t sound like he lacks room in his budget.

How much more do you think you get to write off for childcare?", "Not sure how that works, say if her income goes towards childcare, would the taxes really override what she is spending in childcare?\n\nI do not have kids so idk. Sounds like her job is not exactly a high earning job if it will only cover daycare.", "That's not remotely how US tax law works. I don't want to get sidetracked into a tax law discussion, but filing separately disqualifies one from the most lucrative tax credits and is almost never going to give a better refund than filing jointly.\n\nSource: I used to research tax law as well as teach classes on how to prepare basic returns.", "That is fair, but doubt divorcing her will leave him with much fun money.", "This is my mindset I rather money go towards college fund or retirements.

I only see things he wanted to buy but wasn\u2019t allowed to do so. \n\nEta. Of course saving is good, but he should be allowed a splurge now and again", "Bumping up a tax bracket just means that the part over the threshold is taxed at a higher rate.\n\nSo if the tax rate at $50k is 10% and the tax rate at $75k was 15% and you had some personal allowance of 10k, you'd pay no tax on the first 10k, 10% tax on your next $40k and 15% tax on the next 25k. \n\nNow, if her salary is just mostly going to go to childcare there's no point because they're just going to spend it all on something they wouldn't otherwise spend it on, but going up a tax bracket isn't going to decrease the total amount of money you make unless you're getting some kind of benefits and you make too much to stay on those or something.", "It doesn\u2019t.

Decent chance you\u2019ll lose most of your savings in a market crash anyways, either for your retirement accounts or underwater on a house or \u2026.\n\nAnd I mean, how much is it really worth to you to have a few extra grand in your retirement account if your husband is god awful miserable every day? \u2018Cause I\u2019ll tell ya, the only thing more expensive than a divorce attorney is the lost life insurance policy when it\u2019s cancelled due to self-inflicted mortality.\n\nAgain, nobody\u2019s saying spend every red cent, but **both** of you should weigh the value of saving a dollar versus spending a dollar, and make sure you\u2019re spending *some* of it on things that actually bring you joy.

If you are able to earn more once the kids are older, this helps the marriage or any post-marriage budgets for you both.)\n\n2-To agree on savings goals per month and per year. \n\n3-To agree on a way to consider major purchases.\n\n4-To consult a finance and tax planner to advise on the above three points and help you make the most of your income/s and the magic of compound interest.", "Right!?!
