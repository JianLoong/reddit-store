She put up a good fight for a while. About a month ago her doctors decided it would be best for her to be on home hospice. My mom agreed.\n\nBefore she got put in hospice she was at the hospital for a while trying different treatments for her cancer. My grandparents (her parents) ended up getting temporary custody since she couldn\u2019t take care of me. \n\nSince I was 5 and my parents got divorced I spend every weekend with my dad. I enjoy the weekends at my dads. 5 years ago he married my stepmom and I got 2 step sisters. Well my dad\u2019s house isn\u2019t that big so my stepsisters share a room and whenever I stay I sleep on the couch in the living room. So it isn\u2019t an ideal place to stay all the time.\n\nWell since my mom got put on hospice I\u2019ve wanted to spend as much time with her as possible. So my grandparents didn\u2019t force me to go to my dads they understand that I want to spend time with my mom. Well it\u2019s upset my dad that I don\u2019t want to visit him even though I explained that I just want to spend more time with my mom. \n\nToday my dad and stepmom showed up at my grandparents house saying he\u2019s my dad and it isn\u2019t right they don\u2019t encourage me to see him a couple times out of the week. My grandparents said I can make my own decisions and that I have every right to rather be with my mom right now they stay at his house. My dad talk about how it is part of the court agreement and how if he has to he\u2019ll take my grandparents to court. \n\nI stepped in and said if you make us deal with family court while my mom is on hospice and we\u2019re just trying to spend as much time together as possible I\u2019ll never forgive you. My stepmom put her 2 cents in calling me a brat for trying to guilt trip him into letting me not go see him. She tried saying she \u201cunderstands\u201d I want to spend time with my mom but that doesn\u2019t mean I can just stop seeing my dad. So AITA?\n\nAlso in my moms will she stated she wants me to live with my grandparents full time but continue to see my dad on weekends if I would like to.", "created_utc": 1668381396, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yui2zz/aita_for_telling_my_dad_ill_never_forgive_him_if/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But this is clearly a temporary extenuating circumstance, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to be upset with them for not being willing to make an exception for your sake.\n\n(Also, IANAL, but the fact that there\u2019s not even a good space for you to sleep when you\u2019re there bc of your step siblings, part of me wonders if taking your grandparents to court would blow up in their face)", "NTA.

You poor baby.  I am so very sorry.   Spend a much time as you can with your momma.  And if they try to take your Grandparents to court, they won't get too far.   They literally have no where for you to sleep.   A couch in the living room is not an appropriate bedroom for a child to sleep in and would count against them.   Also, you are old enough to choose where you want to be.   Hopefully your Grandparents can get permanent custody of you.   They need to make sure to let the court know about this little event.   Document everything, this is only going to get worse.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry for all this you're dealing with. Not only your mother entering hospice, and all the emotions that go with that.

It really can't be easy. \n\nI worked in a hospice and have seen the fallout from families who have been separated, for whatever reason, and have had to come together when a loved one has been ill. \n\nYour father and in particular your SM are putting you in a terrible position which is not helpful. \n\nThe only thing I would say is to NOT allow your SM to dictate things between you and your father. \n\nAs much as you want to spend as much time as possible with your Mum, don't allow it to hinder your relationship with your dad.  You are still allowed to spend time with him and should not feel/be made to feel guilty being away from your Mum. \n\nMaybe you could spend an hour with your dad, having coffee or something? Just to catch up? This doesn't have to include your SM.

It might be worth getting your grandparents to proactively get legal custody of you *before* your mother passes.

I'm sorry they are doing this to you when you are trying to spend as much time as possible with your Mum.  You said money isn't a problem, I think this is a big factor in your Step Mum & Dad's behaviour, I know it's not a good time, but I think it is probably important that your Grandparent's & Mum speak to a lawyer about your custody arrangements until you are 18.  If you are to inherit money etc from your Mum, it sounds like they will want access to it.  Again, I'm sorry you are going through this.", "NTA. Your dad and stepmom have no heart whatsoever. They are not good people.", "NTA- I would be very wary of why your father is acting like this all of a sudden\u2026 I would guess he has his eyes on anything you stand to inherit\u2026 might be wise to have a conversation about that with your mother and grandparents and get a lawyer to ensure everything is water tight\u2026", "NTA for telling your dad the truth - that you will never forgive him if he starts a family court battle while your mom is in hospice and you are experiencing loss.  That is an absolute truth that you feel and you are not wrong to tell him that.", "NTA.  At 16 you are old enough to decide for yourself where you want to live.  Call his bluff.

You Dad may miss you, but he's going to get a lot more time with you in the future.\n\nHe took the nuclear option and his wife was disresptful. I would make sure neither of them are allowed at the your mum's funeral.\n\nI'm so sorry your family is going through this.", "NTA. Are you in the US.  If so, in some states at your age you get to choose where you want to be.  Also, in some states the fact that you must sleep in the couch \nCould be a problem.  They don\u2019t even have a room for you.", "NTA. You\u2019re a human being and he\u2019s treating you like an object, more specifically a possession. I believe parents have a right to be in contact with their children, but only insomuch as it isn\u2019t actively damaging to their children. It might be different if you were significantly younger, but at 16, you are absolutely old enough to inform your own decisions. It is clear that your desire to spend every available second you can with your mom is not in defiance of your custody arrangement.\n\nIf your father were parenting out of legitimate concern for you, then he would never consider interfering with your choice. It sucks, but he doesn\u2019t see you as your own entity; rather, you are an adjunct of him. When people tell you who they are, believe them; your father is telling you- with actions instead of words- that he believes what he \u201cdeserves\u201d is more important than what you want; that it is your responsibility to be *his daughter* rather than his responsibility to be *your father* right now. If I were in your shoes, the fact that it has already gone as far as him suggesting such action would be across a few lines. I would already be considering a life of LC/NC based on the very threat. If he actually went to court, it would be over between us. It\u2019s distressing that he would even consider prioritizing these weekends over the rest of your lives together. He\u2019s the asshole.\n\nBonus asshole: your stepmom. Holy shit. She can STFU and GTFO of this entire conversation. She has abso**FUCKING**lutely no right to breathe a word of this to you unsolicited.  Furthermore, I find it sad how many of us fail to see glimpses of our own potential futures in the current actions of the people in our own lives. For all she knows, this a behind-the-scenes view of what her life could be subject to if their marriage ever fails.\n\nMost importantly, OP, you are receiving an early and extremely education in how unfair life can be. I\u2019m sorry. Fight for and cherish every moment you can get with your mother; it is further unfair that you should have to fight for them. There is nothing stopping him from getting in the car and coming to *you* to take *you* for dinner or a movie. It\u2019s important to take a moment to breathe from time to time, and he could make an effort to be there for you in that respect. Yet his priority is about what you can do for him. He should be a rock for you, instead he\u2019s a stone tied to your leg in a rising tide. You seem to be keeping your head about you, and that\u2019s a sign of strength that will serve you well. Believe in yourself, and make sure to take time for yourself to take care of yourself. If therapy is available, start now. You\u2019re strong, but remember the strongest thing anybody can do is admit when they\u2019re feeling weak. It\u2019s ok to not be ok, and it\u2019s important to take a moment for self care when you aren\u2019t. I wish you the best.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
