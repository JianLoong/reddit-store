You are still allowed to spend time with him and should not feel/be made to feel guilty being away from your Mum. \n\nMaybe you could spend an hour with your dad, having coffee or something?

If so, in some states at your age you get to choose where you want to be.  Also, in some states the fact that you must sleep in the couch \nCould be a problem.

I believe parents have a right to be in contact with their children, but only insomuch as it isn\u2019t actively damaging to their children. It might be different if you were significantly younger, but at 16, you are absolutely old enough to inform your own decisions. It is clear that your desire to spend every available second you can with your mom is not in defiance of your custody arrangement.\n\nIf your father were parenting out of legitimate concern for you, then he would never consider interfering with your choice. It sucks, but he doesn\u2019t see you as your own entity; rather, you are an adjunct of him. When people tell you who they are, believe them; your father is telling you- with actions instead of words- that he believes what he \u201cdeserves\u201d is more important than what you want; that it is your responsibility to be *his daughter* rather than his responsibility to be *your father* right now. If I were in your shoes, the fact that it has already gone as far as him suggesting such action would be across a few lines. I would already be considering a life of LC/NC based on the very threat. If he actually went to court, it would be over between us. It\u2019s distressing that he would even consider prioritizing these weekends over the rest of your lives together. He\u2019s the asshole.\n\nBonus asshole: your stepmom. Holy shit. She can STFU and GTFO of this entire conversation. She has abso**FUCKING**lutely no right to breathe a word of this to you unsolicited.  Furthermore, I find it sad how many of us fail to see glimpses of our own potential futures in the current actions of the people in our own lives. For all she knows, this a behind-the-scenes view of what her life could be subject to if their marriage ever fails.\n\nMost importantly, OP, you are receiving an early and extremely education in how unfair life can be. I\u2019m sorry. Fight for and cherish every moment you can get with your mother; it is further unfair that you should have to fight for them. There is nothing stopping him from getting in the car and coming to *you* to take *you* for dinner or a movie. It\u2019s important to take a moment to breathe from time to time, and he could make an effort to be there for you in that respect. Yet his priority is about what you can do for him. He should be a rock for you, instead he\u2019s a stone tied to your leg in a rising tide. You seem to be keeping your head about you, and that\u2019s a sign of strength that will serve you well. Believe in yourself, and make sure to take time for yourself to take care of yourself. If therapy is available, start now. You\u2019re strong, but remember the strongest thing anybody can do is admit when they\u2019re feeling weak. It\u2019s ok to not be ok, and it\u2019s important to take a moment for self care when you aren\u2019t. I wish you the best.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your father and step mother are pathetic for not understanding this.  \nSo here are My thoughts:\n1. At your age,  most judges will say a parent can't throw you in a car and force you to go.  Same would apply to your grandparents. \n2. Your stepmother has no legal right to say a thing. She is not a party. This is only  between your father and grandparents.   \n3. Your father is being an insensitive jerk and someone should tell him that. \n4. A judge will not order you to give up time with your mom at this critical stage. \n5. By the time they get in to court,  it will be months in most jurisdictions and you will have had that time with your mom.  \n6. Your grandparents can ask that you speak to the judge. If you are in the US and the judge says no to you testifying, ask for an  attorney ad litem or guardian ad litem to represent your interests. \n7. Make sure your grandparents let the court know you sleep on the couch. Tell them to phrase it that the father gave so little  consideration to timesharing with his child that he made a decision to secure a residence that didnt included space or even a bed for you. \n\nGenerally, when a parent passes away the other parent gets custody. You can't give a child away in a will.  But depending on where you live,  your grandparents may be able to file for visitation or custody. Since your father doesn't have room for you, he may agree to let you stay with them and visiting him on weekends. \n\nGood luck OP.  Make the most of your time with your mom.\n\nEdited to say NTA.", "NTA he\u2019ll get laughed out of court considering he doesn\u2019t even have a room for you.

It's normal and natural to want to spend as much time as you can with your mom.

I'm not encouraging you to cut your Dad off or anything like that but I don't think they have quite the pull that they think they do because your say counts in this as well.

My advice would by to try not to burn down any bridges with any family you will have left after the inevitable happens with your mom, but maybe you don't to be in your dad's life later, IDK. I think your dad does miss you though and his intentions may be misguided, they are in the right place, maybe go have lunch or something just you and him sometime and explain your side before it gets to a point of no return.

Think of yourself locked in a room.  It would likely be very unpleasant.  However I\u2019d you can open the door and walk out anytime you want, it\u2019s not so bad and may be a safe space.  Sometimes parents worry that something is preventing them from seeing their kids and they have a fight response (locked room).  Often when they know they still have access and time (open door) they don\u2019t worry and this don\u2019t fight as much.

Second, my father also never had a bedroom for me and I also had to sleep in the living room.
