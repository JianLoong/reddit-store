You are still allowed to spend time with him and should not feel/be made to feel guilty being away from your Mum. \n\nMaybe you could spend an hour with your dad, having coffee or something?

I believe parents have a right to be in contact with their children, but only insomuch as it isn\u2019t actively damaging to their children. It might be different if you were significantly younger, but at 16, you are absolutely old enough to inform your own decisions. It is clear that your desire to spend every available second you can with your mom is not in defiance of your custody arrangement.\n\nIf your father were parenting out of legitimate concern for you, then he would never consider interfering with your choice. It sucks, but he doesn\u2019t see you as your own entity; rather, you are an adjunct of him. When people tell you who they are, believe them; your father is telling you- with actions instead of words- that he believes what he \u201cdeserves\u201d is more important than what you want; that it is your responsibility to be *his daughter* rather than his responsibility to be *your father* right now. If I were in your shoes, the fact that it has already gone as far as him suggesting such action would be across a few lines. I would already be considering a life of LC/NC based on the very threat. If he actually went to court, it would be over between us. It\u2019s distressing that he would even consider prioritizing these weekends over the rest of your lives together. He\u2019s the asshole.\n\nBonus asshole: your stepmom. Holy shit. She can STFU and GTFO of this entire conversation. She has abso**FUCKING**lutely no right to breathe a word of this to you unsolicited.  Furthermore, I find it sad how many of us fail to see glimpses of our own potential futures in the current actions of the people in our own lives. For all she knows, this a behind-the-scenes view of what her life could be subject to if their marriage ever fails.\n\nMost importantly, OP, you are receiving an early and extremely education in how unfair life can be. I\u2019m sorry. Fight for and cherish every moment you can get with your mother; it is further unfair that you should have to fight for them. There is nothing stopping him from getting in the car and coming to *you* to take *you* for dinner or a movie. It\u2019s important to take a moment to breathe from time to time, and he could make an effort to be there for you in that respect. Yet his priority is about what you can do for him. He should be a rock for you, instead he\u2019s a stone tied to your leg in a rising tide. You seem to be keeping your head about you, and that\u2019s a sign of strength that will serve you well. Believe in yourself, and make sure to take time for yourself to take care of yourself. If therapy is available, start now. You\u2019re strong, but remember the strongest thing anybody can do is admit when they\u2019re feeling weak. It\u2019s ok to not be ok, and it\u2019s important to take a moment for self care when you aren\u2019t. I wish you the best.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your father and step mother are pathetic for not understanding this.  \nSo here are My thoughts:\n1. At your age,  most judges will say a parent can't throw you in a car and force you to go.  Same would apply to your grandparents. \n2. Your stepmother has no legal right to say a thing. She is not a party. This is only  between your father and grandparents.   \n3. Your father is being an insensitive jerk and someone should tell him that. \n4. A judge will not order you to give up time with your mom at this critical stage. \n5. By the time they get in to court,  it will be months in most jurisdictions and you will have had that time with your mom.  \n6. Your grandparents can ask that you speak to the judge. If you are in the US and the judge says no to you testifying, ask for an  attorney ad litem or guardian ad litem to represent your interests. \n7. Make sure your grandparents let the court know you sleep on the couch. Tell them to phrase it that the father gave so little  consideration to timesharing with his child that he made a decision to secure a residence that didnt included space or even a bed for you. \n\nGenerally, when a parent passes away the other parent gets custody. You can't give a child away in a will.  But depending on where you live,  your grandparents may be able to file for visitation or custody. Since your father doesn't have room for you, he may agree to let you stay with them and visiting him on weekends. \n\nGood luck OP.  Make the most of your time with your mom.\n\nEdited to say NTA.", "NTA he\u2019ll get laughed out of court considering he doesn\u2019t even have a room for you.

I'm not encouraging you to cut your Dad off or anything like that but I don't think they have quite the pull that they think they do because your say counts in this as well.

My advice would by to try not to burn down any bridges with any family you will have left after the inevitable happens with your mom, but maybe you don't to be in your dad's life later, IDK. I think your dad does miss you though and his intentions may be misguided, they are in the right place, maybe go have lunch or something just you and him sometime and explain your side before it gets to a point of no return.

Think of yourself locked in a room.  It would likely be very unpleasant.  However I\u2019d you can open the door and walk out anytime you want, it\u2019s not so bad and may be a safe space.  Sometimes parents worry that something is preventing them from seeing their kids and they have a fight response (locked room).  Often when they know they still have access and time (open door) they don\u2019t worry and this don\u2019t fight as much.

Second, my father also never had a bedroom for me and I also had to sleep in the living room.

NTA", "NTA by a long shot.  You\u2019re father is being extremely selfish right now by not letting you spend as much time as possible with your Mom.  If he wanted to be a good father and support you during this extremely difficult and sad time, he could be coming to you and asking what you need, taking you out for a meal or an activity to give you little breaks here and there, not demanding that you leave your Mom every weekend.", "NTA I am sorry you are dealing with this and I am so sorry that on top of that you are dealing with two adults whom are not being understanding.   You are 16 the courts will be willing to listen to you and your wishes also stating that you do not have your own space at your fathers place I cannot imagine they would think this is best for you.  It would end up a disaster for your father.    I bet the court order is in place before you had to give up your room. \n\nWhat I would do is state what you want from your father.  If he could drive over to harass your poor grandparents who are dealing with losing their daughter.  To harass his daughter that is losing her mother.  To let his wife call said daughter names. \n\nThen he can drive over and take you to see your mother.  He can cook some meals and drive over and drop them off so nobody at your needs to worry about that.  He can drive over to help you with your homework or an evening. \n\nIf he insist you go there call your local social services and state you feel unsafe.   As you are left to sleep in a stared family room.  You need to tell your dad that this is not acceptable and as a young adult (teen) that you need this to be resolved.", " NTA - they are thinking once mom is gone that she will live full time with them.  Think of all the benefits- free babysitting, benefit money once her mom dies - built-in housekeeper.\n\nThey are not even concerned with what she is going through just anticipating what they will get in the end.", "NTA. Try having a chat with your dad without your stepmum there. Is there someone reasonable on his side of the family, like a grandparent, who can play mediator? Explain that were the shoe on the other foot and you had limited time left with dad you would do the same thing. Explain that you love him and you love spending time with him but that you have year left with him and very little time left with mum. Perhaps he can come visit you at grandparents house each weekend for a few hours as a compromise?", "Sorry for your situation OP.  NTA.", "NTA \n\nYour mom is on hospice, so he and his AH wife think they should center themselves?\n\nYour dad is going to try for full custody as soon as your mom is gone. Tell your grandparents to be prepared. \n\nI am so sorry for all of this. Lean on your grandparents and trustworthy friends.", "In my state, anyone 14 years or older has a say in their custody and visitation agreements.  They don\u2019t always get their way, but they get a say. I hope this also applies to you.  My best wishes to you and your loved ones.\nNTA, but your father sure is.", "Stay the course, dear girl. You\u2019re on the right track and NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re losing Mom. You and your grandparents will be a consolation to each other. Thank God for them. If not for them, you\u2019d be Cinderella at Dad\u2019s house. Hellish!", "NTA. Note for your step mum: You're sixteen - according to most courts in first world countries, you actually absolutely *can* just decide you don't want to see your dad anymore. If you tell a judge you don't want to see him, they will take you seriously. So they both need to stop acting like this is something they can *force*, because it's not. \n\nAt *best*, if they push this, they get you for two more years; before you go NC with them out of resentment and, as punishment for his behaviour, your dad literally never gets to see you again. They need to understand that they are *not* in a position to be making demands here. You basically get to decide what your relationship is going to look like from now on. You have the power here, not them.", "Girl, as a father I'm terribly sorry they are putting you  through all this in this very hard period.\n\nNTA AT ALL.", "NTA. And if they do go to court you have to bring up you\u2019ve been sleeping on the couch at all your visits. That will not look good to the judge.", "NTA. But honestly if I were you, the threat alone, and allowing his wife to talk down to you, I wouldn't voluntarily spend anymore tone with those people. How fucking insensitive can someone be.", "NTA. I had to go through losing my mum to leukemia, it absolutely tore me to pieces to see her waste away and I am more than twice your age. Your father and stepmother are absolutely selfish beyond belief. Saying or even thinking along the lines of \"Yeah it's hard but you should consider us\" is quite frankly disgusting. You are at an age when you can decide so what you said is completely fair. Sending you good vibes or hugs or whatever it is that may help.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, going to court will more than likely backfire on him.  You are 16 years old, and you are old enough that the courts will take into consideration who you want to live with. He doesn't even provide you with proper accommodation when you are there.  You sleep on the couch, in a common area, and don't even have any semblance of privacy.", "NTA\n\nAlso just want to say I am so sorry you are going through this, I lost my mum to Ovarian cancer aswell and its truly horrific, your dad should be thinking about how upset you are and going to be than to try and force this issue. If he does take it to family court after she passes tell the judges you want to live full time with your grandparents and agree to see your dad for a day at a neutral location that stepmum cannot be harassing you and calling you names! I doubt many judges would enforce you staying with him when they dont actually have the room for you to live there plus you could just leave as soon as you are of age", "NTA remind daddy dearest that a judge will laugh him out of court when you tell them you don't even have a bedroom. Tell the judge it makes you uncomfortable, you are old enough to assert your needs. And being with your mom right now is a needn't a want. Like, how having a bedroom is a need not a want.", "NTA. Not in a exact similar situation but my mom also has ovarian cancer, and if ANYONE. ever told me I was staying home in the weekends too much and they \u201ctruly understand my situation but think I\u2019m somehow using it as an excuse to get out of things\u201d I would cut them out of my life. \n\nThis shit isn\u2019t easy at ALL to deal with, good health or not. And I will never understand why some people take it to the extreme like this because it\u2019s ridiculous. I stayed home and moved out of my dorms in college (granted I go to school in the same town my parents live in) just so when my mom first went* through chemo I could still be there because family is important to me. Seems like it is to you and you should never ever be guilted or shamed about that. \n\nI hope you and your family are all doing well.", "NTA", "What's the dad's endgame here? He apparently cares enough about his daughter that he's forcing her to visit him? But he doesn't care if she resents him for the rest of her life? What does he even want?!", "Right. If he wants to spend time with her, he can take her to lunch 1 on 1. Then she gets most of her time with her mother and they get quality 1 on 1 time. That would show empathy, understanding and could provide emotional support at this time.", "The dad has the rest of his life to spend time with OP, but OP only has maybe a month to be with her mom.", "That's going to be VERY rare considering she has no room at her father's place and she is 16. Very, VERY rare.\n\nIf her father does force the issue it's a fast way to make sure his daughter never speaks to him again in less than 2 years. Hell, bet she never speaks to him again period. The courts might be able to force her to visit but they can't force her to speak to her father or her stepfamily.", "Indeed. A lot of parents don't seem to get that visitation is for the good of the child, not for the parent. When it begins to harm the child a court won't force it. Forcing contact at this point is only going to be emotionally harmful. Few courts would force it.", "Qualified Immunity is a thing, and not one judge or GAL will be held accountable. It's disgusting", "Oh, family court judges are THE WORST here in STL. Corrupt assholes, every single one of them. \nHad a judge refuse to continue a case when I had no lawyer & forced me to represent myself- lost custody of my son. \nShe was/is friends with my son's father's lawyer, so.. funny how it all just worked out for him \ud83d\ude44\nOthers just ignored me repeatedly telling the court about SA from son's father over the years. Don't go to family court if at all possible.."]}
