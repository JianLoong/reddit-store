I was living with her full time before she passed. She left me a lot of money and her house. Since the house was just going to stay empty until I was done with college my aunt (on my moms side) and I talked about it and we agreed she would stay there since she's taking care of my grandma and her place was small. I will move back in once I've finished my schooling.\n\nMy dad assumed my mom left me her money and left the house to my aunt. I didn't correct him because I don't trust my dad or have a great relationship with him. I am currently living with him, his wife Jan, and her twin daughters(17, both lovely people) in a 3 bedroom flat. 2 months ago he found out that my mom left me the house. I'm not sure how he found out but he did. Since then I haven't heard the end of it, I'm selfish for making us all stay in a tiny flat, I'm spoiled because I won't share my inheritance, I'm a terrible person for making the twins take out loans. You get the gist.\n\nThis weekend was the twins birthday at my grandma's house. Most of my dad's family was there (we get along great usually), his wife's family, and some of both of their friends there along with the twins friends. After they were done opening my present to them they asked me if that was really it. (I got the matching bracelets with their birthstones, which they both loved btw) It got quiet and I asked them what else they were expecting. They said Jan said that I was planning on surprising them on their birthday by telling them we were moving into my moms house and helping them with college. My grandma asked Jan if this was true and Jan started in on me again. She asked what she could do to make me stop being a bitch, pull my weight, help out, and be fair.\n\nI told her she could drop dead. That my mom died for me to get all these things she wanted me to give her daughters. I said if she wanted everything to be fair then she should drop dead and I would share everything I had with her daughters since we would have all lost a mother then. That it would be fair only after that happened. She and my dad started yelling at me and my grandma and uncles started yelling at my dad and  Jan and everything was pretty much over after that.\n\nThe whole ride home my dad and Jan were getting calls and texts from family and friends telling then they were disappointed in them and I was getting texts from Jan's family, the twins friends, and a few of my own cousins saying I was selfish. I don't usually fight with my cousins so I'm really starting to think maybe I am being selfish and that I went to far at the twins party.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676431677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112obi9/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_to_drop_dead_in/", "score": 2065, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're still a minor yourself.

It was generous of you to ensure your aunt and grandma had a place to live, but you gave that gift freely, and your aunt discussed it with you first. Your mom left those assets for you. They're yours. You get to decide how you use them, and nobody else.\n\nIt's true what you said to Jan was harsh and said in (righteous) anger. You can decide if you want to apologize for losing your temper which might help to ease the drama and your conscience. But what Jan did to attempt to coerce you into using your money for her gain? Don't even entertain apologizing for that. Stick to your guns and set clear boundaries going forward -- the use of that money and that house are not up for discussion or debate, and any attempts to manipulate or coerce you will be shut down.

The gifts you brought sound lovely.", "NTA-I am sorry for your loss.  Everything you said was true.  You do not owe them anything.  Can you move into your house with your aunt?", "NTA, and I\u2019m really sorry about your mom.", "NO, you are not being selfish, and YANTAH.  You lost your mother, little over a year ago and Minnie the Moocher and Brutus are counting your money.  Move with your aunt and Grandma in your home.  They have no right to money your mom left you.  You are still grieving; you do not need this BS.", "Im sorry for you loss. \n\nThey only want the money and care less for your loss. They don't care that you lost someone important. \nThey are selfish. All they are saying is me, me, me. You on the other hand, gave the house to your aunt, so that she can take care of your grandma. \n\nEven if you didn't share it and lived in the house, your mum would wanted it. She wants you to live a good life and in  the only way she could help you, after her death. \nSo keep being strong and don't listen to your father and step family!\nNTA", "Firstly - very sorry to hear that you lost your mum.\n\nNext - You\u2019re definitely NTA. Your dad is an AH and his wife even more of an AH. \n\nIf you\u2019re not able to move into your house now, maybe look for somewhere else, maybe a 1 bed place that your aunt / grandma pay for in lieu of them living at your house? \n\nI\u2019d get out of where you are living currently as soon as you can. It seems a little like you are living a real life Cinderella story\u2026", "NTA tell her that you would give all that back just to have your Mother again and you dont care what she thinks or wants this is NONE of her buisnes. She should drop dead she wants to live there and take all our stuff that your Mother left for you.", "Please stay strong and do not give in to the pressure. You should NOT share this inheritance. If it is possible to stay with a relative, you should try to do that.", "NTA. Move back into your mother\u2019s home (your home) with your Aunt and grandmother. You do not have to be abused by Jan and your father. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you lost your mom so young. I have two teenagers and I couldn\u2019t imagine them having to say goodbye to me now. I am sending mom hugs and love virtually.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is hard, but your mom raised you to be a strong, independent person so don\u2019t ever let someone like your evil stepmother try and take that away from you.\n\nAs for your inheritance, let your father and stepmother know that it is YOUR inheritance to do with as you wish. It is NOT theirs, nor are they entitled to even have an opinion on what you decide to do with it. Emphasize that their actions thus far has made it to where you are never going to share your inheritance with them or the kids, that your decision is final, and there will be NO further discussions on the topic of YOUR inheritance moving forward. \n\nI believe that you should be selfish since this was something YOUR mother left for YOU, for YOUR future. Do not let these people bully you, and yes, dad and stepmom are definitely bullying you over this. Reiterate to them that it\u2019s not your fault that your father and stepmother can\u2019t afford to buy their own home or rent a better place, that it is NOT your responsibility to take care of them. Tell them they, as the parents, are financially responsible for THEIR children because it seems they\u2019ve forgotten that fact.\n\nI wish you the best, and hope your father and stepmother stop being such selfish pricks and maybe take lessons on financial planning so they can buy their own house in the future.", "NTA and I'd start forwarding ur cousins' texts to their parents. As for Jan's family and the twins' friends texts, I'd post those online.", "You're harsh, but not the asshole. That is your inheritance, your mother left it to you so that you could do what you needed to do. It is not for anyone else to have a day in how you spend it.", "NTA. Stay strong and know that you are honoring your mother's wishes.", "NTA\n\nPerfect response", "You are so NTA here jt hurts. Dude your step mom and dad can go kick rocks. Love what you said. Good for you.", "NTA. Obviously it could have been phrased more kindly, but your stepmom deserved it completely for making promises about YOUR inheritance. The point is that the twins still have their mother, who can support them emotionally and financially over time, and you got a lump sum. That\u2019s YOUR money and YOUR house, and is meant to last you for your entire life. Don\u2019t start giving anything to anyone, or they\u2019ll never stop asking until they bleed you dry.", "NTA. If the money is enough to send 3 people to college, it should be enough to rent a small place by yourself until you graduate. You don't have to live with your dad or your aunt.", "NTA. Your dad and stepmom are awful, and creating a division between you and your stepsisters. Which is so sad! You call them lovely people and they really liked your gifts! No, you shouldn\u2019t be forced to share your inheritance, and I hope you can get out of there soon. Totally understand why you can\u2019t right now, but dad and Jan are going to make your life hell. That\u2019s so unfair, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. You lost the most important person in your life, and now you\u2019re losing the family you have left because the parents are greedy jerks. It\u2019s cruel, they are cruel. You\u2019re not cruel or an asshole, and please stay strong. \ud83d\udc9c", "Hun NTA all the way. Your mom intended for YOU to get the house and money. If she had wanted you to share it she would\u2019ve left them money. She didn\u2019t so do what you\u2019d like with it. So sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f", "Your dad and his wife are teying to financially abuse you. You need to get out of that situation somehow. You are not the twins parents, they are not your responsibility and this whole situation was caused by your dads wife attempting to coerce and control you.", "For real!\n\nAlso shout out to grandma and the uncles for not putting up with that shit.\nNTA all the way", "FOR REAL. OP is a minor which means her dad can run some bullshit through the system and possibly take her house/inheritance. Get that in order asap", "Yes this.", "I agree wholeheartedly. As I was reading this I thought, I would have completely caved at that age. Proud of you, OP!", "I'm not sure that not being able to afford a bigger house or pay their entire way through college is \"failing as a parent.\" Wealth isn't the only measure of a person's success. \n\nThe stunt at the party and trying to deprive the 17 year old of her inheritance definitely isn't successful parenting though.\n\nOP is NTA. Her father and stepmother are not doing well here. And surely OP's mother, were she still alive, would have used her money on her own mother and sister, not her ex-husband, his new wife and stepchildren. As well as OP, of course.", "but sometimes people need to see the drama to see how f-ed up their request is.", "They are her stepsisters.", "Yep, this!!", "Her father should support her because she is a minor. She shouldn't give anything because this will reopen their claims to her money.\n\nShe can move out at 18, or even sooner if she wants to emancipate.\n\nWhy would a minor be responsable for the household?", "INFO have you talked this through with the twins, you don't owe them an explanation but they sound like good people? Are you leaving your dads place too?", "Don\u2019t cave OP. That money and house is ONLY for you. Don\u2019t let them push you to share. Your mother left that all for you, no one else.", "I am very sorry for your loss! It would be terribly triggering to be in the house and your mom not being there. When my mom died seeing some spaces in the house where she often would make me cry so hard. And I was 45. Having to deal with such a terrible loss at your age is just awful. \n\nYour dad and stepmonster demanding to move in is beyond heartless. Being in your old house and seeing that woman there instead of your beloved mom would send anyone into a spiral of grief. They aren\u2019t wondering how to help their child with this tragedy. They\u2019re only wondering how they can profit.", "Make a backup plan, with how your dad and step-mom are acting, it sounds like you\u2019ll be kicked out soon, my guess is whatever your 18th birthday is. Be prepared just in case, as technically, your dad will be allowed to kick you out come your 18th birthday.", "Maybe ask other relatives on your mom's side if you could stay with them? Give them the update because with how ridiculous your dad and Jan are being, they might just head to the house and try to kick your aunt and grandmother out.", "That's entirely understandable with what you've gone though, but be prepared to be kicked out the minute you turn 18.", "Yes.  Tell anyone asking they should ask their own mother for help, not your mother", "She should also get a will. Make sure those people can't get their hands on it if something happens.", "I'd say your aunt is right about that. Very sorry for your loss; your mom sounds like a great person.\n\nMaintain your backbone, and don't let them shame you into going along with their BS.", "You are amazing. Do not give in to those selfish people. Your mom was awesome and raised a caring, smart child. \u2764\ufe0f NTA", "Your aunt is correct.  You are a very good person", "She did!", "Please, please do this !!!", "While I agree that you don\u2019t have to have money to be a good parent, one could assume that if OPs mom was well off, that her father also had the means to be that way.    We don\u2019t have enough info to know that.    But we can assume that he\u2019s and entitled jerk and has probably made some bad decisions because of it.", "I am wondering why would twins'friends get involved in this private matter if the twins didn't felt entitled to her inheritance.\n\nI mean think about it:\n\nYou say to your bff: \"I think OP will give us money for college and we're going to live in her house. Mom told us this\".\n\nThen you find out you're getting nothing.\n\nDo you think your bff will start harassing OP to guilt her into giving you money?\n\nOr your bff will say \"OMG, your mom lied!\"", "OP is 17 the money isn't even in her name, I do t think, the aunt probably has it and it'll transfer over when OP turns 18 so what did her dad think was gonna happen?", "As I was reading this I thought, I would have completely caved at that age. Proud of you, OP!", "Nah I lost my mom at that age and being around dying people was/ Is extremely triggering for me so it makes a lot of sense why OP doesn\u2019t want to be in that situation. Also I remember 17 and applying to college being super stressful on top of recently loosing a parent. I think op is right abt not staying there. It\u2019s not worth the extra distress imo.", "The texts were on the ride home.  The twins probably haven\u2019t had a chance to fill their friends in on the backstory.", "Yeah, OP, Jan was totally out of line. Greedy, insensitive, and manipulative.\n\nYour answer was perfect. \n\nDon\u2019t second guess yourself. Your dad and Jan should be ashamed. \n\nYou have money. Many people will tell you how to spend it. Ignore them. Save your money for your needs and life goals. Your mom left it to you. Kindness and gifts are fine, modest charitable giving is laudable. But you are young with a long life ahead of you.", "I don't want to sound unfeeling but I lost my father at age 5, my daughter when she was two, and plenty of sexual abuse when I was a kid. I think triggering is just a way to prevent yourself from growing past the trauma. I embrace the past and use it as a tool to heal. Hiding from it and expecting everyone in the world to save me from even hearing about things like this seems very unhealthy and a poor way to go about life.", "And honestly I can see why", "This sounds like you have a different experience regarding trauma than others, and neither are wrong. What you're suggesting however by having her live 24/7 around someone dying after a recent death is called flooding and can exacerbate the trauma and make things worse, and is not a recommended treatment.\n\nNot everyone can just \"man up\" like you seem to think, and it's not weak or unhealthy to need time to heal.", "Not everyone can handle trauma the same way though. Some people deal great with handling it head-on like yourself. Others would rather bury their head in the sand and try to forget it.\n\nThere isn't a one-shoe-fits-all advice for this unfortunately.", "Wow I\u2019m so sorry for your losses. But yeah I guess I don\u2019t mean avoid all triggers forever but at in my perspective I struggled so much after loosing my mom and nearly dropped out etc\u2026I\u2019m still young and still slowly going through school but way behind my peers. so personally I want op to focus on doing well in school right now esp if they\u2019re not doing therapy or anything to help process. \n\nI get that some people can go though great traumas and be functional but personally dealing with (I\u2019d say extreme if causing panic attacks) triggers like that while in school slowed me down exponentially and I wish done more to help cope at that time. But I\u2019m a highly sensitive person so I can\u2019t speak for OP or anyone else.", "It was mom's act of love to make sure OP was taken care of because her dad and his wife are 100% assholes."]}
