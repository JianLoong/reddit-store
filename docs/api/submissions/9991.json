I was living with her full time before she passed. She left me a lot of money and her house. Since the house was just going to stay empty until I was done with college my aunt (on my moms side) and I talked about it and we agreed she would stay there since she's taking care of my grandma and her place was small. I will move back in once I've finished my schooling.\n\nMy dad assumed my mom left me her money and left the house to my aunt. I didn't correct him because I don't trust my dad or have a great relationship with him. I am currently living with him, his wife Jan, and her twin daughters(17, both lovely people) in a 3 bedroom flat. 2 months ago he found out that my mom left me the house. I'm not sure how he found out but he did. Since then I haven't heard the end of it, I'm selfish for making us all stay in a tiny flat, I'm spoiled because I won't share my inheritance, I'm a terrible person for making the twins take out loans. You get the gist.\n\nThis weekend was the twins birthday at my grandma's house. Most of my dad's family was there (we get along great usually), his wife's family, and some of both of their friends there along with the twins friends. After they were done opening my present to them they asked me if that was really it. (I got the matching bracelets with their birthstones, which they both loved btw) It got quiet and I asked them what else they were expecting. They said Jan said that I was planning on surprising them on their birthday by telling them we were moving into my moms house and helping them with college. My grandma asked Jan if this was true and Jan started in on me again. She asked what she could do to make me stop being a bitch, pull my weight, help out, and be fair.\n\nI told her she could drop dead. That my mom died for me to get all these things she wanted me to give her daughters. I said if she wanted everything to be fair then she should drop dead and I would share everything I had with her daughters since we would have all lost a mother then. That it would be fair only after that happened. She and my dad started yelling at me and my grandma and uncles started yelling at my dad and  Jan and everything was pretty much over after that.\n\nThe whole ride home my dad and Jan were getting calls and texts from family and friends telling then they were disappointed in them and I was getting texts from Jan's family, the twins friends, and a few of my own cousins saying I was selfish. I don't usually fight with my cousins so I'm really starting to think maybe I am being selfish and that I went to far at the twins party.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676431677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112obi9/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_to_drop_dead_in/", "score": 955, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was generous of you to ensure your aunt and grandma had a place to live, but you gave that gift freely, and your aunt discussed it with you first. Your mom left those assets for you. They're yours. You get to decide how you use them, and nobody else.\n\nIt's true what you said to Jan was harsh and said in (righteous) anger. You can decide if you want to apologize for losing your temper which might help to ease the drama and your conscience. But what Jan did to attempt to coerce you into using your money for her gain? Don't even entertain apologizing for that. Stick to your guns and set clear boundaries going forward -- the use of that money and that house are not up for discussion or debate, and any attempts to manipulate or coerce you will be shut down.

It's why so many actors/athletes end up broke because their families and friends loot them. \n\nNTA! Please find another place to live. This isn't safe for you and honestly I feel like there isn't enough space for five people in a three bedroom place in this situation.

You clearly illustrated your point and her insanely selfish demands and attempts\nTo manipulate and steal from you.  \n\nCan you live with your aunt and grandma?

It is great that you can help Grandma and Aunt.\n\nSo, you were living with your father under somewhat dishonest circumstance, and you were rude in what was a *horrible* situation.\n\nIt turns out, that rudeness was kind of a normal reaction, because Jan, and presumably your Father, were *supreme* AHs.  Most people would respond poorly in that situation at that birthday party.\n\nI would say everyone sucks here, but that does not get across just how much of an AH Jan and your father were.  \n\n\nNTA, but there is a lot here\n\nGood luck", "ESH.  Obviously, telling your step mom to drop dead at your stepsisters' birthday party was not the done thing.   Now they get to remember the drama and stress instead of the fun and excitement.  Not cool.   \n\n\nBut for the situation in general, your dad and stepmom are just being awful.  You don't owe your stepsisters your inheritance.  You don't owe your dad a house.  You're still a child yourself for goodness sake!  They should be supporting you and booking appointments with a financial planner so you can make educated decisions, not guilting you and attempting to get the inheritance for themselves.     \n\n\nI'm sorry you're in such an awful situation.

I'm glad this didn't ruin your relationship with them as they seem to realize they were being used.   As a mom I applaud your ability to stand up for yourself and what is rightfully yours.

As cliche as it sounds, I'm sending you good vibes and positive thoughts for your mental health on this matter.", "Jan reminds me of my own mother. We call those kinds of people narcissists - they will do anything to get their way, and are incredibly good at manipulating people like the twins (my mother did that to me). \n\nWord of advise for them: There are those who will take advantage of your kindness and gentile nature - and they are usually the people closest to you. Do not let them fool you repeatedly, and when they do and it's discovered - put their feet to the fire and make them answer for it. Show them even if you are nice and gentle in your nature, that nature also only has so much patience and you won't tolerate lies and deceit. If you don't and continue to be toyed with and hurt, you will eventually become quite the cold and cynical person, and it will impact your future relationships in the worst of ways.", "Nta. You are amazing and owe them nothing. Don't let them manipulate you or guilt you in any way. Your cousins just don't understand and you can only do and say so much to make them understand.

They are not your responsibility.", "Good call", "This is the way", "I lost my dad when I was 9 and boy do I admire your strength and wittiness. NTA. You are my hero. Your mom is definitely grinning and laughing from heaven.", "NTA. I\u2019d give billions of dollars I\u2019ll never have to get one minute with my dad again.

In no shape or form does she have any claim to your mother\u2019s $$$.As to what you said, yes, not to the point, but she had manipulated you into a horrible situation, and after what she let everyone expect, let\u2019s face it, nothing would have been acceptable other than for you to share your $$ with your stepsisters\u2026 Don\u2019t do it because they expect this, or because she manipulated you, or because your cousins are mad about a lie that your stepmother concocted. but if you feel that you might wish to contribute to the household, offer to pay for a weekly cleaning service, or add some $$ to the monthly food budget, buy your clothes etc from that money. But it\u2019s up to the twins\u2019 parents to pay for their college, not yours. \n\nYour Mom must have left instructions on how to use the $$ and how much.
