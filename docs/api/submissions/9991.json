I was living with her full time before she passed. She left me a lot of money and her house. Since the house was just going to stay empty until I was done with college my aunt (on my moms side) and I talked about it and we agreed she would stay there since she's taking care of my grandma and her place was small. I will move back in once I've finished my schooling.\n\nMy dad assumed my mom left me her money and left the house to my aunt. I didn't correct him because I don't trust my dad or have a great relationship with him. I am currently living with him, his wife Jan, and her twin daughters(17, both lovely people) in a 3 bedroom flat. 2 months ago he found out that my mom left me the house. I'm not sure how he found out but he did. Since then I haven't heard the end of it, I'm selfish for making us all stay in a tiny flat, I'm spoiled because I won't share my inheritance, I'm a terrible person for making the twins take out loans. You get the gist.\n\nThis weekend was the twins birthday at my grandma's house. Most of my dad's family was there (we get along great usually), his wife's family, and some of both of their friends there along with the twins friends. After they were done opening my present to them they asked me if that was really it. (I got the matching bracelets with their birthstones, which they both loved btw) It got quiet and I asked them what else they were expecting. They said Jan said that I was planning on surprising them on their birthday by telling them we were moving into my moms house and helping them with college. My grandma asked Jan if this was true and Jan started in on me again. She asked what she could do to make me stop being a bitch, pull my weight, help out, and be fair.\n\nI told her she could drop dead. That my mom died for me to get all these things she wanted me to give her daughters. I said if she wanted everything to be fair then she should drop dead and I would share everything I had with her daughters since we would have all lost a mother then. That it would be fair only after that happened. She and my dad started yelling at me and my grandma and uncles started yelling at my dad and  Jan and everything was pretty much over after that.\n\nThe whole ride home my dad and Jan were getting calls and texts from family and friends telling then they were disappointed in them and I was getting texts from Jan's family, the twins friends, and a few of my own cousins saying I was selfish. I don't usually fight with my cousins so I'm really starting to think maybe I am being selfish and that I went to far at the twins party.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676431677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112obi9/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_to_drop_dead_in/", "score": 9676, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're still a minor yourself.

It was generous of you to ensure your aunt and grandma had a place to live, but you gave that gift freely, and your aunt discussed it with you first. Your mom left those assets for you. They're yours. You get to decide how you use them, and nobody else.\n\nIt's true what you said to Jan was harsh and said in (righteous) anger. You can decide if you want to apologize for losing your temper which might help to ease the drama and your conscience. But what Jan did to attempt to coerce you into using your money for her gain? Don't even entertain apologizing for that. Stick to your guns and set clear boundaries going forward -- the use of that money and that house are not up for discussion or debate, and any attempts to manipulate or coerce you will be shut down.

The twins are 17 too, are they \u201cpulling their weight?\u201d You dad and Jan are absolutely delusional. I\u2019m so sorry you lost your mom at a young age and now have to deal with this. What I suggest, is you fine a financial advisor and invest that money so that you can be in an amazing place when you are older. Only fend for yourself, you owe them nothing.", "NTA. Your answer was perfect and brought their demands into the correct context as they were pretending you just won this stuff.", "NTA\n\nIt's your money and it's your house.  Your mom left them to YOU, not your step-sisters, Jan or your Dad. It's entirely up to you whether you want to help them out.  Jan put you in a terrible position.  You obviously like your step-sisters.  Hopefully, this won't put a wedge between you three.", "I'm so sorry you lost your mom, OP.

Honestly the fact that she would push you into a corner like that makes me think you should probably try to change schools and potentially look at moving in with your aunt in your house if you can. Because I don't see her getting any less aggressive about it. Also just add it was deeply wrong of her to put you in that position. Reinforce it one more time it's your money that you got from your mother dying you need to do something for yourself with it you only need to help your stepmother father or stepsisters if you feel like the reason is justified. If you don't want to spend the money on them don't let them guilt you push you or in any way manipulate you into giving the money it will be a never-ending tab and they will never reciprocate the favor.", "NTA in the slightest.

Don't share it with them because it'll never be enough and it'll never end with people like that. I hope you can get out of there because it sounds like hell.

So get ready for the fight.\n\nYou're dealing with some mighty entitled people there and I suspect that if you give in, you'll regret it because they will suck you dry.\n\nYour reasons for why you're not sharing are valid. You lost your Mother. That is what she had left to give you, and she gave it to YOU. Not anyone else because I'm pretty sure if she had wanted anyone else to have anything, she would have arranged for it in writing.\n\nMove on with your life, ignore these grabbers, these takers.

Nta", "NTA - We\u2019ve seen similar in other threads. That inheritance is yours from your mum\u2019s passing, you should not feel compelled to make up for your Dad and Jan\u2019s lacking of finances and it is not your job or their money to fund the twins or anything else. That expectation from them is money grabbing and selfish, and completely inappropriate.\n\nWhilst understand why you kept knowledge of ownership of your mother\u2019s house from your dad (I can see why) it is slightly disingenuous to do so but still live with your dad. Was it possible to live in the house with your grandma and aunt ? I think this is perhaps the only mis-step but does not make you an AH in my eyes by any stretch. I assume your grandma is your mother\u2019s mother - maybe it\u2019s part of the cycle of life that you help look after her with your aunt.\n\nAs for being an AH for saying drop dead to Jan \u2026 this was a passive aggressive attack from them which turned into an emotionally charged argument. Yeah it\u2019s not great to say drop dead but actually it sounds like you half meant it and half used it in the context of inheritance. So NTA once again as overall you were illustrating a point. \n\nAs it stands I can\u2019t see this situation being resolved as your dad and Jan appear to feel they\u2019re entitled to your inheritance! As is common, they feel jealous and hard done by that someone closely linked with them has money and isn\u2019t sharing it. I\u2019ll re-iterate, it\u2019s NOT your job to fund them and they should NOT expect you to!!! That is completely unreasonable. \n\nThis is a sad situation and I feel for you. But you must be bold. You MUST do what is right for you! Your dad isn\u2019t on your side and your mother cannot be. Protect yourself, take a leap and move away from your dad\u2019s family, it sounds toxic.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, genuinely.", "NTA, and you did not go too far, they dragged you over that line kicking and screaming. emotional manipulation (or an attempt at it) at it's absolute worst.

If it was fine then, it\u2019s fine now. It\u2019s not your fault. You don\u2019t owe them. \n\nYou are not selfish, they are. Just because you have something that someone else wants, doesn\u2019t mean you owe them anything. Be wary of everyone who feels entitled to what is yours.", "The twins sound like they are growing up to be good people in spite of how their mother is acting.  Accept their apology and tell them that you don't hold anything against them.  Tell Jan and your Dad that if they continue to act this way they end up risking the relationship between you and the twins by using them as pawns in their messed up parenting game.", "This.\n\nOP, I'd actually ask your Aunt to take you to an attorney ASAP to get all of the assets tied up in trust with your Aunt as the executor of the estate until you are 25 (by then you will have graduated from University).\n\nPut the assets in the Trust. You should not have to deal with this crap.\n\nNEVER let Jan move into your Mom's house because the moment she does she is going to do everything she legally can to gain posession of it.\n\nWell done on dealing with Jan publicly.\n\nAs for her family - respond to every single text with \"You are CLEARLY related to Jan since you feel it is acceptable to bully a minor. This is harassment. I am blocking you now.\" Then block them.\n\nThe twins friends, respond with \"You ONLY get to have an opinion when your parent dies and you are left living with the most manipulative lying liar that lies on the face of the planet. Until then, keep your opinion to yourself. I am blocking you now.\"", "Happy cake day! \ud83e\udd73", "Of course \"dad\" picks stepmom's side. She's his bed warmer. Much more important than helping his actual blood relative, his own daughter cope with her grief. OP is just a reminder of his failed first marriage. \n\nI wish I could include a /s with that statement, but I'm probably too close to the truth for everyone's comfort \ud83d\ude15", "Yeah it's going to be the parents' fault at the very least since they pushed OP into situations he really doesn't fit in. The better way to solve this might be to go to the Aunt's house or some family relative's house that is on OP's side. And for the people angry at him, I think they just don't understand the position he is coming from. Who in the world would expect OP to always share anything with the twins at all? What the parents' did that got my blood boiling would be to not get OP's side or opinion at all, OP's the one who is going to share everything he has yet he doesn't get dibs on what he'll share? Damn, that's not okay.\nNTA.", "I get it. Sometimes you have to take the lesser of two evils is all I meant. If your two choices suck, pick the one that is going to help you grow. One is going to draw you down and the other will strengthen you.", "Thanks for clarifying. I guess I am a failed optimist. I hope for the best but I'm not surprised if it goes south. I just expect life to be difficult and my job is to carry on no matter what. It might not be overly healthy but it keeps me going."]}
