I was living with her full time before she passed. She left me a lot of money and her house. Since the house was just going to stay empty until I was done with college my aunt (on my moms side) and I talked about it and we agreed she would stay there since she's taking care of my grandma and her place was small. I will move back in once I've finished my schooling.\n\nMy dad assumed my mom left me her money and left the house to my aunt. I didn't correct him because I don't trust my dad or have a great relationship with him. I am currently living with him, his wife Jan, and her twin daughters(17, both lovely people) in a 3 bedroom flat. 2 months ago he found out that my mom left me the house. I'm not sure how he found out but he did. Since then I haven't heard the end of it, I'm selfish for making us all stay in a tiny flat, I'm spoiled because I won't share my inheritance, I'm a terrible person for making the twins take out loans. You get the gist.\n\nThis weekend was the twins birthday at my grandma's house. Most of my dad's family was there (we get along great usually), his wife's family, and some of both of their friends there along with the twins friends. After they were done opening my present to them they asked me if that was really it. (I got the matching bracelets with their birthstones, which they both loved btw) It got quiet and I asked them what else they were expecting. They said Jan said that I was planning on surprising them on their birthday by telling them we were moving into my moms house and helping them with college. My grandma asked Jan if this was true and Jan started in on me again. She asked what she could do to make me stop being a bitch, pull my weight, help out, and be fair.\n\nI told her she could drop dead. That my mom died for me to get all these things she wanted me to give her daughters. I said if she wanted everything to be fair then she should drop dead and I would share everything I had with her daughters since we would have all lost a mother then. That it would be fair only after that happened. She and my dad started yelling at me and my grandma and uncles started yelling at my dad and  Jan and everything was pretty much over after that.\n\nThe whole ride home my dad and Jan were getting calls and texts from family and friends telling then they were disappointed in them and I was getting texts from Jan's family, the twins friends, and a few of my own cousins saying I was selfish. I don't usually fight with my cousins so I'm really starting to think maybe I am being selfish and that I went to far at the twins party.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676431677, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112obi9/aita_for_telling_my_dads_wife_to_drop_dead_in/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Take every precaution to protect that money so your dad doesn\u2019t try to steal it!", "NTA. Jan is acting entitled to your inheritance and your dad won\u2019t stand up for you, which sucks.

She ruined her own daughters' birthday party. \n\nI am sure OP would give up everything to have her mother back. She is blessed that her mom provided for her future, because obviously her father would not be supporting her through school and such. Hopefully you have a lawyer you can trust because I don't trust your father or stepmother.", "NTA but you do need to be cautious. Your dad found out likely because you are a minor so he would be informed about your inheritance. Depending on how everything happened he may legally be able to make decisions on your behalf (at least until 18) so he MAY be able to evict aunt and grandma and move in (until you turned 18 and evicted them) it wouldnt be a sound decision but he maybe could. Ianal so I'm not certain. Have a discussion with your aunt and see if you are protected.\n\nCan you live somewhrre else? I think it would be better for you.", "NTA. Your financial gain, especially at the expense of such a great loss, does not mean you are suddenly responsible for the financial health of your extended family.\n\nI'm sure you're a mature young woman, and it sounds like maybe you've had to grow up older than your age, but hon. You're still a minor yourself. You're in no way responsible for the college educations of two other girls your own age, and you're definitely not responsible for providing a place for your adult father and his adult wife to live. It was generous of you to ensure your aunt and grandma had a place to live, but you gave that gift freely, and your aunt discussed it with you first. Your mom left those assets for you. They're yours. You get to decide how you use them, and nobody else.\n\nIt's true what you said to Jan was harsh and said in (righteous) anger. You can decide if you want to apologize for losing your temper which might help to ease the drama and your conscience. But what Jan did to attempt to coerce you into using your money for her gain? Don't even entertain apologizing for that. Stick to your guns and set clear boundaries going forward -- the use of that money and that house are not up for discussion or debate, and any attempts to manipulate or coerce you will be shut down. Enlist the assistance of a trusted adult (your aunt?) for backup if you need it.\n\nGood luck.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
