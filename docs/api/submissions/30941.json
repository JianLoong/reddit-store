I can't really pinpoint why but I just find it gross but I know a lot of people enjoy tampons. To each their own but nobody can force a 12 year old to wear one. As for the hygiene thing, she is old enough to take care of herself. I understand preteens and teenagers tend to not have the best hygiene in the world. It can be a real fight to get them to shower sometimes or wash their hair or remember deodorant. But that doesn't mean you just let them do whatever.\n\nHer mother needs to be responsible and sit down and talk to her. Or her father or guardian. Not trying to pinpoint this on any particular gender. The 12-year-old can then make a decision. She can switch her period products to give him more freedom in the pool or she can choose other activities. Everybody else should be swimming around in somebody's blood because somebody wants to take a fit and thinks that a preteen is exempt from all hygiene practice.\n\nIt's one thing if your teenager didn't want to wash their hair when they were supposed to.

I actually asked my husband the other day but he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. So I started my period at 8. So if my daughter starts her period at 8 is that not too young for a tampon? I only ask because an 8 year old vagina is hypothetically much smaller than a 15 year old vagina? Not because of sex or anything but literally because 8 year old are tiny and not fully grown. I was going to ask her pediatrician but I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask an internet stranger.", "I was going to say exactly the same thing. Can't use one's with an applicatior at all.", "I have tried to fixed it after insertion but it doesn't seem to work. Regardless if I sit or if I put my foot on the edge of the tub. I may try a disc and see if that does anything. Though they are pricey too, they aren't as bad as swimwear.", "The different sizes was the key for me.  Even if it was my heaviest day, I would be wearing those labeled for lighter days or for younger users because those were the ones that fit in place.", "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had worst things/people down there.", "The first time I saw an applicator I was so confused! Not commonly seen in Aus either.", "it\u2018s even drier to insert without applicator. i lived in switzerland (mostly o.b.) and mexico (applicators only). applicators weirded me out but they allow a fluffier tampon to get inside instead of a hard a short o.b. tampon.\n\ni changed to cups and eventually discs because of the treatment the fiber in tampons get and because of TSS.", "I agree with this. Also using the right size for the flow. OB is the brand I buy (US) but if I\u2019m trying to shove an ultra in when I\u2019m on a light day, I\u2019m going to have a bad time. It\u2019s less fuss and less garbage, I just wash my hands like I already should be doing.", "I know of only one brand in the US that doesn't have an applicator, it's called OB. I agree that it's easier without an applicator. Plus as has been mentioned above, you can add a little lube and that makes it much easier.", "OB tampons come with a \"lolly pop\" stick for a guide.

And now I feel these 'woke' brands are encouraging it, like womens liberation allows you to be feral and disrespectful too. No more busy public pools for me, i'd be sus of any black swimsuits around me lolz.  I learnt to use a tampon at 12 so I could go swimming.

The blood is caught between the vulva and the swimsuit.

They come in many colors and patterns, just only the cheap ones only come in black. \n\nAlso... Do you not realize how much chlorine you use in a pool?! The tiny amount of blood that would escape, would be neutralized in seconds. That's the whole point of using such strong chemicals in the pool, is to keep it clean. I've never free bled in a pool as far as I know, but we always had one growing up, an in ground, and I NEVER asked my friends if they were on their period or not if they were coming to swim. And if they tried to stay out of the fun for it I'd encourage them to join in if they want to. My parents never shamed us for a natural body function that didnt hurt anyone. Why do you feel it's okay to bully a 12 year old over something we all do? She's 12, why are we pressuring her to put ANYTHING up there. It could do more harm than good. Absolutely not. If she's not comfortable with tampons or cups, the risks are too high. She might forget it and get toxic shock syndrome (a real thing!) for all we know. SHES A CHILD.\n\nI'm 28. I've used tampons, cups, pads, ILPs, reusables, etc. You name it Ive used it. But I am not for forcing a CHILD to put anything inside them when they are not comfortable with it... And the fact you think she should be punished for not doing so is honestly... Concerning. Deeply.", "I don't like tampons because my period is often light and mostly clots. Tampons will basically remain dry and end up being painful to remove. I use period pants because they're comfortable and also it's cheaper than constantly buying period products.\n\nThey're actually very thick and honestly I could probably swim in my normal period pants. Also period swimwear and pants come in many different colours and you probably wouldn't even know who's wearing them. You're the one that's getting butt hurt over people choosing not to wear a tampon swimming. You literally admit that tampons hurt, and it was a horrible experience. Maybe, and this might be wild for you, just maybe, people don't want to make themselves uncomfortable just to make everyone else comfortable. So we should allow a literal child who isn't ready to insert period products inside themselves to choose the option of just owning period swimwear.", "For fucks sake, everything you dislike is not \"woke.\" Learn what words fucking mean before you throw them around, snowflake.", "Of course they have PFAs.
