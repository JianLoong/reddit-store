That is disgusting!!! Is this pool chlorinated at all?  If she is on her period, she needs to use a tampon when swimming or a swim diaper, something!  If she doesn't, I wouldn't let her in.  If your pool is not regularly cleaned, you do not need someone bleeding into it!", "NTA. This is an easily solvable problem. \n\nI was on a swim team for 6 years as a \u2018tween and teen, often swimming 3-4 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. Trust me that she just needs to use tampons. If she\u2019s not good at judging timing yet, period-proof swimwear is a real thing, now.", "NTA. When I was 12 I got my first period on the day a pool trip was planned with my friends. Thankfully I was educated and simply used a tampon, brought extras and that was that. If she\u2019s not comfortable with that, unfortunately sitting out on things because of personal circumstances is a part of life. If you start getting serious flack from the other adults, a nice reminder that private pools are a luxury because you don\u2019t have to worry about other people urinating/dead skin/poop/food ect is a good place to start, because this is your money therefor your rules you can set..", "Teach your niece about using tampons.

Idk but periods are gross. As a girl I feel as if they are gross and should be kept to yourself. Also like there's not just blood, like tissue also gets released and it's gross.", "NTA... you can buy period bathers fairly cheaply. My 13yr okd wears them in the pool & loves them.", "NTA\n\nSomebody can have the talk with her about using a tampon or a cup but you can't force her to do it. Personally I feel highly uncomfortable ramming one of those up there and walking around with it. I'm full grown adult and I just don't like it. I can't really pinpoint why but I just find it gross but I know a lot of people enjoy tampons. To each their own but nobody can force a 12 year old to wear one. As for the hygiene thing, she is old enough to take care of herself. I understand preteens and teenagers tend to not have the best hygiene in the world. It can be a real fight to get them to shower sometimes or wash their hair or remember deodorant. But that doesn't mean you just let them do whatever.\n\nHer mother needs to be responsible and sit down and talk to her. Or her father or guardian. Not trying to pinpoint this on any particular gender. The 12-year-old can then make a decision. She can switch her period products to give him more freedom in the pool or she can choose other activities. Everybody else should be swimming around in somebody's blood because somebody wants to take a fit and thinks that a preteen is exempt from all hygiene practice.\n\nIt's one thing if your teenager didn't want to wash their hair when they were supposed to. It's another for them to be bleeding in community water", "NTA. They clearly know nothing about how to keep a pool hygienic. The amount of additional chemicals you'd need to add would risk making the water outright dangerous - to be properly clean you'd need to change it out completely, which is wasteful.\n\nChlorine kills bacteria etc but produces byproducts that can be carcinogenic or even mutagenic. If you run your pool as a salt water pool it's not *as* bad, but it's still a problem.\n\n(If you smell that \"chlorine smell\" around a pool, that pool isn't clean enough.)", "NTA\n\nI naively assumed that they would not free bleed into the pool, but probably the same as pissing into the pool\n\nyour pool, your rules. out of interest how would this be enforced ?", "INFO \n \nWhy do you have to buy the pool?\n \nDoesn\u2019t flow stop in water?\n \nHave you confirmed niece isn\u2019t wearing period swimweear?", "This. Perhaps if OP Is up to buying the pool (and I'm still wondering why they asked OP to pay the whole shot in the first place) the parents can buy the swimwear for the niece.\n\nBut someone does need to have a heart to heart with the girl about period care. At 12, she may not know all of the options or repercussions of poor hygiene.", "Now I feel really stupid cause I\u2019m 28 and still don\u2019t know how to properly put it a tampon. I never put it in deep enough. I got so frustrated with it I just kept using pads.", "While I agree OP is NTA, assuming they can \"just put in a tampon\" is rather weird. I still can't at 34 as I have vaginismus and it just hurts like crazy. (However, I also never went free bleeding into a pool \ud83d\ude48) A 12 year old that can't put in a tampon isn't that weird to me at all", "You can also get period swimwear now, so there is literally no excuse for her", "I have a 13yo. I have been trying to get her to use tampons and she can\u2019t figure it out. No way she\u2019d have a cup figured out.", "I would be shocked if she actually is bleeding into the pool. The used pad is weird for sure. But if you go in the pool while on your period, the pressure kinda seals it in. So you don't just bleed into the water.", "And as for the adults that don't ever use tampons or cups: my best friend has never used them, and as someone who is OBSESSED with swimming, she has become very comfortable refraining from swimming on her period. It's a bummer but it's only once a month.", "Water pressure can slow your flow but it doesn\u2019t actually stop it.

They are similar to period underwear but designed for swimming. I was never able to put a tampon in properly and the period swimwear was amazing", "Try Playtex Sport (if you want to try again)", "I found the trick is to push the tampon out a little bit, smear a few drops of lube on the tampon itself, and then push it back in the applicator. Now when you try to insert it, the tampon will glide right in and go much deeper. Makes a world of difference! I discovered this at age 40 so don\u2019t feel bad! I also use the T\u00e1mpax pearl for the smooth applicator. But not the *pocket* pearl, because those applicators don\u2019t work for crud.", "Try squatting or lifting your leg onto the rim of the toilet. You gotta push it in till your whole pointer finger is inside you and there is a little bit of string hanging out. You know it's in properly because when you stand up you won't feel it.

I guess I'll just have to get this stuff next time I plan to hop into the pool if I happen to be on my period. Either that or buy overpriced swimwear meant for periods.", "Yeah but do you force your bodily fluids on others without consent because that is the lesson the 12 yr old is currently learning.", "Modi bodi have a pretty wide range and have a black Friday sale on right now https://www.modibodi.co.uk/collections/swimwear", "I think it's the tampon to applicator ratio. It never gets that \"falling out\" feeling", "The applicator is super smooth easy to insert and the tampon shape just stays in place and expands better than say tampax.", "Don't worry sweetie, the internet strangers have your back. I hate tampons too and have tried multiple times over the years. 3 kids delivered naturally and a lot of tryung different brands, but I can finally have one stay in and in place and I still find them uncomfortable.\n\nIt's all just experimenting until you find which brand and method works for you but you will get there.", "You could also have hymen leftover that is being jabbed by the tampon.", "Of course not.
