I like my job and had no plans of leaving. During this time we were not a dog friendly office.  My company owns the building we work in.  It's your basic office with cubes and offices and conference rooms and includes a grassy patio area.  Around 25-30 people work here full time. Its not a job you can really work from home consistently as it requires in person collaboration and is hands on. \n\nIf this job was dog friendly when I was hired, I would have never taken the job.  I can't stand dogs.  Everything about them really.  My dislike of dogs has never impacted my life, career, family, or friends till now.  To be honest, I usually don't bring it up to non friends/family because I get a lot of hate.  So I usually stay quiet and try to remove myself from a situation as best I can. \n\nWe recently had Salary and Benefit review one on one meetings with HR. We are all getting 6% raises. They took suggestions on benefits that we'd like to see.  I gave my input, overall I was pretty happy with our benefits.  However, a number of co-workers said they'd like to see a dog friendly office.  At the conclusion of the meetings HR took their findings to management.  2 weeks after our one on one meetings, management sent out the proposed changes and requested some final input.  Staff had 2 weeks to respond.  \n\nWell the 2 weeks we had to respond, I was on vacation.  I went on a slightly over 2 week trip out of the country that had been planned for well in advance.  On vacation I didn't check emails or messages.  I went offline as much as I could and didn't see the email asking for final input and was not able to raise any objections till I came back.  Well the dog friendly office had overwhelming support with no objections...until I came back to work.  It was supposed to start Jan 1 in the new year. \n\nWell, I saw the proposal from almost 3 weeks earlier and went straight to HR.  I raised my objections right then.  I told HR that if they were dog friendly when I interviewed I would have never worked here.  I asked them to re-evaluate.  Well they granted my wish and have re-evaluated this and let staff know this is on hold.  They have not committed to anything either way yet with no ETA on a resolution. The thing is, everyone knows it is me and i'm getting the cold shoulder from nearly everyone.  This was very popular and something most were looking forward too.  So Am I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1671063138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm6prw/aita_for_trying_to_stop_my_job_from_having_a_dog/", "score": 1877, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good decision to make an entirely dog friendly office  (even though I would love a dog friendly office) because it creates a whole host of problems for people with allergies or dog fears or other things like that.

I like my job and had no plans of leaving. During this time we were not a dog friendly office.  My company owns the building we work in.  It's your basic office with cubes and offices and conference rooms and includes a grassy patio area.  Around 25-30 people work here full time. Its not a job you can really work from home consistently as it requires in person collaboration and is hands on. \n\nIf this job was dog friendly when I was hired, I would have never taken the job.  I can't stand dogs.  Everything about them really.  My dislike of dogs has never impacted my life, career, family, or friends till now.  To be honest, I usually don't bring it up to non friends/family because I get a lot of hate.  So I usually stay quiet and try to remove myself from a situation as best I can. \n\nWe recently had Salary and Benefit review one on one meetings with HR. We are all getting 6% raises. They took suggestions on benefits that we'd like to see.  I gave my input, overall I was pretty happy with our benefits.  However, a number of co-workers said they'd like to see a dog friendly office.  At the conclusion of the meetings HR took their findings to management.  2 weeks after our one on one meetings, management sent out the proposed changes and requested some final input.  Staff had 2 weeks to respond.  \n\nWell the 2 weeks we had to respond, I was on vacation.  I went on a slightly over 2 week trip out of the country that had been planned for well in advance.  On vacation I didn't check emails or messages.  I went offline as much as I could and didn't see the email asking for final input and was not able to raise any objections till I came back.  Well the dog friendly office had overwhelming support with no objections...until I came back to work.  It was supposed to start Jan 1 in the new year. \n\nWell, I saw the proposal from almost 3 weeks earlier and went straight to HR.  I raised my objections right then.  I told HR that if they were dog friendly when I interviewed I would have never worked here.  I asked them to re-evaluate.  Well they granted my wish and have re-evaluated this and let staff know this is on hold.  They have not committed to anything either way yet with no ETA on a resolution. The thing is, everyone knows it is me and i'm getting the cold shoulder from nearly everyone.  This was very popular and something most were looking forward too.

I like to say dogs should be treated like small children, not babies. Babies are exempt from the consequence and boundaries of the world, they just need food/water/shelter/lots of attention. Once they are toddlers/small children, they need to start learning boundaries and consequences, and have structure in their daily lives to function successfully in the world.

However, a few offices I worked in proved that dog behavior can be the problem. The owner's dog chased the screaming EVP into her office. The owner howled with laughter. The EVP was terrified of dogs. The next dog-friendly office had a VP who let her dog run aimlessly through the office, and when the dog ran into mine, she squatted to poop and I chased her out - then the VP got mad at me. No, she didn't plan on cleaning up the poop, but I should be \"nicer\". \n\nFinal one was Robert DeNiro's film production company. During my first interview, I was told that one man felt it was cruel to leave his dog alone, and didn't trust the doggie day care down the block. After more than one vicious dog fight, half the office wanted dogs gone. The other half wanted to continue having them come in. In this case, as the others, the dogs are generally less the problem, and the jerk owners are the big issue.\n\nYes, I've been in offices and stores where the dogs were perfectly well behaved. Yesterday I walked past a nice service dog that somehow remembered our one meeting a year ago and stood up and looked at me and wagged his tail, and of course I had to say hello to him. But for every 50 of him, the one with the dog squatting in my office or chasing co-workers ruin it for everyone. Train the owners, not just the dogs.", "Excellent point.
