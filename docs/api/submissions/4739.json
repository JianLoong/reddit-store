I like my job and had no plans of leaving. During this time we were not a dog friendly office.  My company owns the building we work in.  It's your basic office with cubes and offices and conference rooms and includes a grassy patio area.  Around 25-30 people work here full time. Its not a job you can really work from home consistently as it requires in person collaboration and is hands on. \n\nIf this job was dog friendly when I was hired, I would have never taken the job.  I can't stand dogs.  Everything about them really.  My dislike of dogs has never impacted my life, career, family, or friends till now.  To be honest, I usually don't bring it up to non friends/family because I get a lot of hate.  So I usually stay quiet and try to remove myself from a situation as best I can. \n\nWe recently had Salary and Benefit review one on one meetings with HR. We are all getting 6% raises. They took suggestions on benefits that we'd like to see.  I gave my input, overall I was pretty happy with our benefits.  However, a number of co-workers said they'd like to see a dog friendly office.  At the conclusion of the meetings HR took their findings to management.  2 weeks after our one on one meetings, management sent out the proposed changes and requested some final input.  Staff had 2 weeks to respond.  \n\nWell the 2 weeks we had to respond, I was on vacation.  I went on a slightly over 2 week trip out of the country that had been planned for well in advance.  On vacation I didn't check emails or messages.  I went offline as much as I could and didn't see the email asking for final input and was not able to raise any objections till I came back.  Well the dog friendly office had overwhelming support with no objections...until I came back to work.  It was supposed to start Jan 1 in the new year. \n\nWell, I saw the proposal from almost 3 weeks earlier and went straight to HR.  I raised my objections right then.  I told HR that if they were dog friendly when I interviewed I would have never worked here.  I asked them to re-evaluate.  Well they granted my wish and have re-evaluated this and let staff know this is on hold.  They have not committed to anything either way yet with no ETA on a resolution. The thing is, everyone knows it is me and i'm getting the cold shoulder from nearly everyone.  This was very popular and something most were looking forward too.  So Am I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1671063138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm6prw/aita_for_trying_to_stop_my_job_from_having_a_dog/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s just how it goes, so you might have to ask yourself if this will be a dealbreaker for you. I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good decision to make an entirely dog friendly office  (even though I would love a dog friendly office) because it creates a whole host of problems for people with allergies or dog fears or other things like that.

I like my job and had no plans of leaving. During this time we were not a dog friendly office.  My company owns the building we work in.  It's your basic office with cubes and offices and conference rooms and includes a grassy patio area.  Around 25-30 people work here full time. Its not a job you can really work from home consistently as it requires in person collaboration and is hands on. \n\nIf this job was dog friendly when I was hired, I would have never taken the job.  I can't stand dogs.  Everything about them really.  My dislike of dogs has never impacted my life, career, family, or friends till now.  To be honest, I usually don't bring it up to non friends/family because I get a lot of hate.  So I usually stay quiet and try to remove myself from a situation as best I can. \n\nWe recently had Salary and Benefit review one on one meetings with HR. We are all getting 6% raises. They took suggestions on benefits that we'd like to see.  I gave my input, overall I was pretty happy with our benefits.  However, a number of co-workers said they'd like to see a dog friendly office.  At the conclusion of the meetings HR took their findings to management.  2 weeks after our one on one meetings, management sent out the proposed changes and requested some final input.  Staff had 2 weeks to respond.  \n\nWell the 2 weeks we had to respond, I was on vacation.  I went on a slightly over 2 week trip out of the country that had been planned for well in advance.  On vacation I didn't check emails or messages.  I went offline as much as I could and didn't see the email asking for final input and was not able to raise any objections till I came back.  Well the dog friendly office had overwhelming support with no objections...until I came back to work.  It was supposed to start Jan 1 in the new year. \n\nWell, I saw the proposal from almost 3 weeks earlier and went straight to HR.  I raised my objections right then.  I told HR that if they were dog friendly when I interviewed I would have never worked here.  I asked them to re-evaluate.  Well they granted my wish and have re-evaluated this and let staff know this is on hold.  They have not committed to anything either way yet with no ETA on a resolution. The thing is, everyone knows it is me and i'm getting the cold shoulder from nearly everyone.  This was very popular and something most were looking forward too.
