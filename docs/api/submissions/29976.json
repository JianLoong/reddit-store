I'm just stunned that a sister could say something like that to another sister. There is seriously something wrong with her. Yes, it's sad for her kids that they're not included, and if you could figure out a way to include them without interacting with your sister, that would be great, but I don't think you're in the wrong for not going out of your way, and I think she's just using her kids to gain some leverage in the situation so she can play more cruel games with you.", "So what is she jealous about?", "NTA. Giving birth isn\u2019t necessarily a relevant factor when it comes to being a mother; there are so many other factors that are way more important. You are a mother. Those kids are yours.

However, she is correct in that you are punishing her children for those words. You could simply tell her, while her children are invited to play dates she is not. So if she wants them to have the dates, she can drop them off or have someone else do it as she is not welcome.", "NTA. *Definitely* NTA.\n\nI wonder why she's so intent on having her children spend time with yours when she doesn't even view your children as family.", "NTA, are the kids collateral damage? Absofuckinglutely. Do they deserve it? Absofuckinglutely not. But... that's not YOUR fault. Her actions had consequences that affected both her and her children. It sucks. But this isn't your fault.

If not, then she really meant it, and I can see why you're keeping away from her and her children.  It's too bad for them, but she has to decide if she really means it, then there is no change, or if she was wrong and should apologize.\n\nI can't believe how cruel she was.  I'm so sorry, and obviously you were meant to be a mother since you care so much about your children, ignore her.", "NTA\n\nAs fucked up as that comment is of your sister. Kids should never be put in the middle of shit. My mom didn\u2019t a long with my whole family because were Christian and the rest is not religious and we weren\u2019t allowed to see our family and today I feel incredibly isolated and left out as an adult. Family is so important to kids and they will truly feel terrible when they get older.

This is a hard lesson.", "NTA. She disrespected you and the rest of the family. It seems particularly hurtful after what you have been through together.

They too blame the world for their problems, expect everyone else to solve their problems and don\u2019t take responsibility for their actions. They believe they can say the CRUELEST things to anyone and get away with it by either just storming away with some tears or a phone call later with a very weak apology. \n\nWe live out of the country and it has taken me nearly 55 years of my life to be able to stand up to my parents and tell them their insecurities and jealousies are not my problems. The fact that I have a successful family does not mean that my leech of a brother (who lives at home, is married, but does not pay rent bc my parents are afraid to ask him) should not have to pay his fair share while each month the amount \u201cexpected of me\u201d increases. \n\nI get you and your sister.

This wasn't a nasty, off the cuff remark. This is a clear reflection of her beliefs that she repeatedly remarked on. Some family isn't worth the title. It's unfortunate that the cousins are collateral damage but it's hard to maintain a relationship with a child without involving their parent.", "OP doesn\u2019t know, but given what the sister tried to convince the brother\u2019s son of, it\u2019s almost a sure thing that the sister\u2019s kids have been primed to treat OP\u2019s children as \u201cother\u201d, and the real objection is getting shut out of being around the brother\u2019s kids.", "Right? Even if there were a way for OP's kids to just hang out with their cousins and not monster aunt, there's a good chance that her kids would end up repeating hurtful things that she has said about OP's kids to them and hurting their self-identities. It can only take hearing something like that once to scar a kid for life.", "People need to start thinking for themselves. They are being sucked into popular beliefs no matter how ridiculous. I wonder if it's because it gives them a sense of belonging. I don't know the \"why\" but it's ruining lives.", "There could be a thousand reasons that we will never get to explain the situation. The reason I assumed social media is because it happens ALL the time. Not excusing anything, but it could explain it.\n\nJealousy (or one reason or another) is a normal thing people experience, and radicalization pipelines are designed to prey on those moments of vulnerability. It doesn't work on everyone, but it's similar to how people get wrapped up in cults or cult-like behavior. \n\nPeople rarely come up with these viewpoints on their own, and its even rarer for them to *voice* these opinions wothout some further validation from another source. Considering the brother was just as shocked, I doubt it came from OP's immediate family.", "Unfortunately yes. They're not all as malicious as Tater Tot and his gaggle of men sucking his dick, but they can be just as effective.\n\nSometimes the creators are sort of victims themselves. They make a post that gets a bunch of attention, so the make more similar posts. The more extreme posts get even more attention and so on. The posts themselves hit certain insecurities or vulnerabilities and strike a chord with the audience, so they keep watching. At first, something might make them uncomfortable, but as it becomes normalized with the content creator, they start to overlook it and see it as normal themselves. \n\nAnd when you're surrounded by people thinking and saying the same thing, those thoughts start coming out in the real world. But when the real world argues against those opinions, the person usually retreats back to the online space where their views aren't challenged. The cycle continues and can be extremely difficult to snap out of.", "That you know of. Most families are not open about that. \n\nAnd don\u2019t let what evil she says bother you. I\u2019ve had 2 c-sections and have been told that I am not a real mother because I didn\u2019t have them vaginally. Utter rubbish. Jealous harpies.", "I could be wrong but part of me wonders if maybe it is some form of jealousy. You meantioned your struggle with fertility and the miscarriages that you sadly went through. You finally being successful in having children must have been a big deal for you and your family, it is very exciting and happy news that you were able to have a children after that difficult time. I'm wondering if maybe she didn't like the attention your family got after. Not saying you did anything wrong because you didn't. Just i know it must have been a big deal and it should be a big deal it's exciting news. She just may not have liked the attention placed on you or your children when they were born. There is also the possibility that she also may have felt like you didn't need her anymore you said she was your support system and was there for you during your struggles it's possible she may feel like she was no longer needed after you had your children. She may have liked feeling needed when you were going to her for support.\n\nObviously this does not excuse her horrible behavior, but because you said it was out of character there has to be something that triggered the change. So i am thinking maybe one of those could be the reason. There of course could be another reason just hard to say what it could be. But you definitely are right to not include her children. She can't have it both ways saying you children aren't yours and not wanting to include them but expecting you to include hers makes no sense.", "Listen to the grandparents' family stories and you'll find it. My grandfather would tell stories about his very impulsive, always drunk and depressed mother's family. It's always in the \"funny\" family stories because nobody thought anything about it then.", "History starts a new page every day. To do something so generous in being a surrogate, but then start saying such toxic bs, something has gone very wrong with your SIL's brain. She desperately needs a psych exam.", "First of all you are completely NTA. Second of all as someone who works in the mental health field if she has been through something traumatic like you said she has been she could have some longer lasting effects from it. I have worked with people who seemed fine for years who had something trigger their trauma and they become different. This is in no way shape or form defending her because what she has said and done is completely not okay", "Did your sister become religious after your children were born? Some religions are opposed to assisted reproductive technologies like IVF and surrogacy. Catholics in particular can be quite fanatical about it. \n\nIf your sister has become more devout, she may be convinced your children came into the world illegitimately. Implying that you should have resigned yourself to not having biological children sounds suspiciously like invoking \u201cgod\u2019s will.\u201d Sadly, many people are willing to throw family under the bus to make themselves seem more pious.", "agreed.", "Maybe. It\u2019s bizarre. I don\u2019t see where OP says which SIL carried her children (brother\u2019s wife or husband\u2019s sister), but any of the latter isn\u2019t mentioned elsewhere in this close family group so it sounds like it\u2019s the brother\u2019s wife. That would mean OP\u2019s sister tried to tell their nephew (brother\u2019s son) that OP\u2019s son wasn\u2019t really part of the family because he hadn\u2019t been carried by OP but instead by the nephew\u2019s own mother. That\u2019s a really trash argument, and no wonder neither OP nor the brother want their sister or anyone who she\u2019s talking to around their kids.", "Sounds like they couldn't be *more* different!", "At some point in our lives we all say things without realising how hurtful they may mean or things we dont even actually mean because we are hurting inside. I do believe in forgiveness, but I do not suggest forgetting it happened. Especially family members, because they are so close to you, know exactly how to hurt you badly and sometimes they do it for completely different reasons than they disclose. I don\u2019t believe anybody is a perfect sibling and has never hurt their brother/sister but I do believe people make mistakes and can make some things right", "True, but it feels more like jealousy based on what is written.", "They ripped you open to pull your child from your body and that means you aren't a real mother?! The mental gymnastics required for that point of view are insane. I am glad you were able to bring your babies into this world however they got here. You are most definately a real mum.", "I've heard that before and my response is, \"Guess I'm not a real person then.\" Because I would not be alive if it weren't for an emergency C Section. And with me gearing up to have my own kid, if I have to have one myself and someone comes at me with this mentality. They will not like me.", "You hit the nail on the head .Jealousy drives so much evil behavior .Maybe the Sister is  jealous  of OP -who is NTA ,by the way .", ">I\u2019ve had 2 c-sections and have been told that I am not a real mother because I didn\u2019t have them vaginally.\n\nThat one always boggles my mind. A sign of a good mother is doing whatever's necessary to protect her children...you'd think that would extend to the manner in which she gives birth. A healthy birth is more important than the manner in which the baby comes out. Though I will say, I have a friend who had twins. She birthed one vaginally and then had to have a c-section for the 2nd twin. She has my utmost admiration for having to heal in both places at the same time. That had to have been rough!", "I once replied \"you're just jealous your kids aren't a emperor and empress\" as c-section is called 'kejsersnit' (lit. Emperor cut) in Danish \ud83d\ude05", "I\u2019ve had two C Sections and as my husband tells it: I climbed up on an operating table voluntarily, was cut open while I was awake, had a human being pulled from my body then held and nursed that human being as I was stitched up and then crawled out of bed every two hours after that to feed that human. 23 months later I voluntarily did it all again. It doesn\u2019t get more mother than that.", "Bruh what \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t safe for you to push your baby out of your cooter, therefore the time you spent carrying your kids and looking after them after they were born just Doesn\u2019t Count\u201d\n\nLike\u2026 that\u2019s the dumbest shit- are these people morons???? Did they read Macbeth in high school and see that whole \u201cnot born of a woman\u201d thing and just run with that for the rest of their lives?????", "Does that means your kids aren\u2019t real kids to these people?

They came outta my body and I can prove it.", "I was also born via emergency C-section and still have a messed up jaw from getting stuck during attempted vaginal birth.

I do feel very sad that she couldn\u2019t experience pregnancy. But I am also super fucking jealous she didn\u2019t have to go through pregnancy. Mine were rough.", "I would have been pissed. Do what needs to be done asap, but oh I would have bitched to high heaven. Kudos to her!", "Nice! I am so using that!", "Cesarian section... C-section", "Part of me wondered that too but wasn't sure. It is definitely possible due to her being her support all that time she may have wanted to support her in that and got jealous that someone else carried the children.", "I've done both and tbh vaginally birth was easier to heal from than C-section.\n\nNTA. Being a mother doesn't mean the same as being pregnant or giving birth. It means caring for a child and fulfilling their needs, teaching them and nurturing them. Whether you have a surrogate, adopt, give birth, use IVF, foster, or step-parent, you are a parent.\n\nIf you want to see your sister's kids, try to do it without your kids around until you assess their attitudes towards your kid. Your child does not need to be told the toxic things your sister has been spewing.", "Can't arge with that. Ouch.", "I have had both and they both hurt like hell in their own way.  For vaginal birth the worst paid is before birth and for a c-section the worst part of the pain is after birth.  Either way was hell because I don't respond to pain meds.", "Had both. C-section is more hard core, vaginal stitches were a comparative walk in the park for me. Pretty sure I'm mother to both my kids though.", "That's what my mom does. I haven't decided on a birthing plan yet. I'm still fighting to get insurance.", "100%! I HATE that other women will say that other who have had C sections aren't real moms.

She had a doctor who specializes in multiples and other high risk births.\n\nHer doctor had seen so much difficulty with multiple births that she highly encouraged my DIL to have planned c section.  That way, all necessary staff would be there for the babies and the mother.  No risk of babies getting in each others' way, and the baby who was laying sideways could come out without any trouble.\n\nI worked in high risk OB back in the day, and I agree with the doctor.  \n\nBtw, the twins were born at 36 weeks, both a good size, and both went home with their mother 4 days post op.", "If you live in the US go on state insurance. Welfare will help. Also sign up for WIC. Food for you and baby.", "Oh good!", "That's what I got kicked off of. When my step-dad passed away a few months ago they kicked all of us in the house off it. I resubmitted paperwork to DHS and was told that my husband I might still make too much.
