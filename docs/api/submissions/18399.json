You are asking multiple people to go through what is to them an uncomfortable situation for the sake of one person. \n\nIt sucks to not be able to bring your son up with grandparents that can be civil around one another, but you may be better off taking your BFs suggestion of 2 parties and having that be the norm moving forward.

I can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s something everyone isn\u2019t telling you about the divorce. Seems like you are missing a piece of the puzzle. \n\nBut anyways, NTA.

Why should your son suffer the consequences of their past mistakes.", "NTA \n\nUnless there is a serious reason to be worried about a relationship between your son and your dad, the rest of the family should respect your decision to make him a part of your and your son\u2019s life.

I'm really sorry there's more tension in your family, and I hope you'll be able to unite everyone.  NTA.", "Op constantly having to tell people that there's been no abuse says alot about how quick people are to shame divorced fathers. and that the father actually divorced her.

I can guarantee that the divorce was harder for them, being older and understanding all of the enmity, for three of their formative years. They have already expressed an aversion to being around him. You knew what you were doing, inviting everyone without prior notice of the attendee they would choose to avoid, and your idea that they can all behave is a fantasy. Historically, your mom and sibs have made it clear that they aren't going to come together happily, why do you expect this to be any different?

Why do people think it\u2019s okay to expect special accommodations for events that are not about them?", "Hate to say it but NAH, they clearly despise your dad and you don't. They are right in cutting you out and you are right in wanting only one celebration. Thing is, there's way too much missing from here. And it sounds like you're the one missing information.

I felt like yeah my baby shower was for me but it was also for my baby and if they couldn\u2019t put stuff aside for her then so be it don\u2019t come.

Keep being very clear with them that they\u2019re invited and you\u2019re not excluding them. It\u2019s 100% their choice not to come, and that\u2019s completely on them.

It\u2019s not your problem unless you let it be.", "NTA\n\nFrom the info your providing your dad doesn't seem like a bad person or like he did anything that would warrant this kind of hostile behaviour.

It won\u2019t be a big party, just our immediate family having some cake and chatting. \r  \n\r  \nMy boyfriend invited his parents and sister with her daughters (7,4). I invited my mom and my siblings. I also invited my dad and his girlfriend.\r  \n\r  \nMy sister asked me yesterday who else was coming as she wouldn\u2019t bring her daughter (5) if there was noone her age because she didn\u2019t want her to get bored. I told her that my boyfriend\u2019s nieces were coming as well so she wouldn\u2019t be the only child. I made the mistake of mentioning that our dad and his girlfriend hadn\u2019t told us if they were bringing her son (3) yet. \r  \n\r  \nMy sister asked me if I was seriously inviting him and I said yes. He is my dad afterall and it\u2019s his grandson\u2019s birthday. She then told me that she and her daughter wouldn\u2019t be coming if he was there. I got pissed at that and told her it was fine, I\u2019m not forcing her to go, and hung up.\r  \n\r  \nShe must have told the rest of my family because both my other siblings have now cancelled as well. My mom called me about an hour ago to tell me she wouldn\u2019t be attending either unless I uninvited my dad. I told her I wouldn\u2019t do that and that she couldn\u2019t just blackmail me like that as it is my dad\u2019s right to be there as much as hers. She got snippy and said it\u2019s my choice and if I preferred my dad over the rest of them I\u2019d have to live with that. I told her I would and she hung up.\r  \n\r  \nI told my boyfriend what happened and he offered to do two parties, one with my mom and siblings and one with my dad and his girlfriend. I don\u2019t want to do that because it\u2019s silly to go to such lengths for something my son won\u2019t even remember. I also don\u2019t want this to become the norm.  \r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m pissed off that my family chooses not to be with my son on his birthday because somebody they hold a grudge against will also be there. But at the same time I don\u2019t want to deprive my son of a relationship with either my dad\u2019s side nor my mom\u2019s side. I don\u2019t want to back down though.\r  \n\r  \nAITA if I don\u2019t reconsider?\n\n\r  \n\r  \nSome context that I didn\u2019t know how to fit in the post:\r  \n\\- I\u2019m the youngest of 4 siblings\r  \n\\- My parents broke up when I was 4\r  \n\\- They had a longwinded custody battle that lasted until I was 7\r  \n\\- My siblings stopped going to weekend visits after they became teenagers\r  \n\\- My mom would talk shit about my dad and his partner\u2019s constantly\r  \n\\- My relationship with my dad has always been better than with my mom\r  \n\\- I kept visiting and know that my siblings\u2019 choice to cut him off hurt him a lot but they were old enough that he couldn\u2019t force them to visit\r  \n\\- I love my family but they can be unbearable at times\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
