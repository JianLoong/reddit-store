Just packing her kid an iPad is ridiculous and mean to her child.\n\nObviously you do not need to take your nephews for monthly sleepovers.

If you enjoy their company and I bet they enjoy yours- ending the sleepovers because Carla is being a shitty parent isn't fair to your nephews. \n\nRather than canceling the sleepovers do not take either child into your home until they have gone through a checklist if they have everything they need. Do it with both kids and their parents so it just seems normal. Eventually if Carla can't get her shit together- her son will because he will know what is expected to be in his bag.\n\nAdditionally things like tooth brushes- you could get a few for your house just in case that stay with you.

Have you always been the family scapegoat? I\u2019m sorry that you are dealing with this and that poor kid. Good luck op.", "NTA, but it seems like this could be solved with less extreme measures. It seems like the issue is Carla gathering everything all at once the night of the sleepover. A reasonable alternative is, on her own dime but at her own pace, provide a set of needed items to stay at your house, and keep sleepovers suspended until that\u2019s done. Once that\u2019s in place, resume and use those items at your house if necessary. Your nephew is family and the sleepovers happen regularly, so it\u2019s not outlandish to have those items for him. They are relatively small and relatively durable. And you only take on the very minor extra work of laundering a set or two extra of clothes each month. And there\u2019s no drop off in comfort or safety for your nephew.\n\nShould this be necessary? No. But you love your nephew, it sounds like you otherwise enjoy the sleepovers, and it seems like the ideal behavior from Carla isn\u2019t likely to happen anytime soon.", "INFO why do you drive to get the stuff instead of insisting either she or your brother come back with the missing items?", "NTA, however I think a much better solution would be to buy all the essentials to keep at your house in a drawer. Your sister isn\u2019t going to wake up one day and not have ADHD, so better to just be proactive and have the stuff already. Nothing fancy or over the top. One outfit, underwear, socks, one set of PJ, toothbrush etc. I think your sister should be the one who purchases it all, but I guess you\u2019ll have to decide that for yourself.", "NTA but you should have made her make the trip to bring the missing stuff. You shouldn't have to drive all the way to her place to fix her mistake. \n\nIf you choose to continue sleepovers, SHE has to make the trip a second time.

Direct, natural consequences are the best way for an ADHDer to learn that they need better management skills.", "If you love your nephews, this is going to hurt them and you.

No. But it would be a nice way to support your nephew.", "I am going to go out on a limb.\n\nPartially, YTA.\n\nADHD symptoms include a poor working memory and poor time management skills.

A toothbrush is a common thing to forget for a whole lot of people. Keep a spare set from the dollar store for your visiting nephews.

I don't know why her husband won't do it, I don't think it's really my place to get involved in how they split household tasks.", "If you want to give her a list every month because she won\u2019t keep track of it, or you can just hold on to it and it be no big deal.", "That\u2019s what she should do, but she won\u2019t.", "Oh, Carla is married? Definitely NTA. I have ADHD myself. If the spouse is neurotypical, why aren't they packing up the bag to make sure their son has everything they need for the sleepover? Failing that, there are a couple of things that you could do, OP, to help and which would be pretty easy:\n\n1) Have Carla keep a bag at your house with the items needed already in it\n\n2) Use an app like Microsoft Teams or To Do that allows you to create sharable checklists. Set up a checklist that's shared between you & Carla with the items needed. Before leaving her house, have Carla check off all items on the list.", "Strongly agree. I have similar issues with my sister and her 3 kids. It drives me insane. But I try to remember it\u2019s the kids who suffer if they don\u2019t come over - it\u2019s not their fault she is like that. OP will drive herself insane getting angry over this issue time and time again - better to accept it as it is for the kids and deal with it on her own. There are only so many years for sleepovers with the kids.", "Clearly this battle is worth it to op. And makes sense. Carla needs to be held accountable for being a terrible parent.", "i mean, we have a couple full sets of toiletries in reserve for guests in case they forget something. i don't think it's that big of a deal and is a nice gesture that would also avoid this whole stressful mess.", "Just as an FYI, if it's really adhd, it's not laziness.", "Psst..the word your looking for is \"onus\". Not bonus.", "I do similar every time I have to take my nieces & nephew for the night or on a trip.\n\nLast time I got told, oh, they don't have pajamas. They just wear the same clothes from that day to bed.", "It almost feels intentional at that point.", "It is actually. It's a p*SS take that Carla has sent her kid over with just his tablet or iPad. And. Nothing else or items missing. Carla is the mother and has been warned and needs to take responsibility. Carla clearly feels she can do as she pleases.", "Adha does not prevent Carla from writing her own checklist. If Carla didn't need someone present to watch her and help her get pregnant then why must everyone now hold her hand to parent her own kid? \n\nPeople need to be held accountable for their decisions and actions. And thirst disrespect. Sending a kid with nothing but am iPad to a sleepover isn't an oversight, it's giving the middle finger to the op. \n\nCarla needs to learn that everyone is not always going to fall over themselves to make her life easier and do everything for her. She needs to take responsibility.", "Typo left it in but thanks anyway", "ADHD is a disability. We all manage it differently and are at different stages of being able to make it. Just like we are not all affected but ADHD in the same degree. \n\nThe OP doesn\u2019t have to make a list, sure\u2026\n\nHowever, it seems like it might be the best support they can provide in order to continue sleepovers.", "So Carla who is a sahm has all day to make a list and pack a bag and all she sends is an iPad. No pyjamas. No toothbrush. No clothes. \n\nYeh that's laziness", "And sit back and watch while Carla does an abysmal job of parenting. Of she can't be bothered to provide an overnight bag what else is she making her son go without? \nSomeone needs to make a stand and say enough. Do better. Be better.", "It's not being ableist to expect a parent to give more than an iPad for an overnight stay. Stop being naive to Carla being lazy", "It's not absent mindedness to put nothing but am iPad in an overnight bag. It's sheer lazyness and disregard. \nIt's not the first time, Carla has been warned multiple times. \nADHD does r stop Carla from making a list and checking items off the list. Of she is so incapable of looking after her kid maybe she shouldn't have the kid in her care.", "Where did I say it wasn't laziness? I even said she has all day to do it. And in fact, at Ben's age, she should be showing him how to make the list, check it, pack his things, etc. Work on his reading skills. Give him tools to potentially manage his own ADHD one day, should he inherit it from her. Make into a game, idk. Little kids like helping.\n\nBut there is no excuse for her not sending her child to Auntie's house without everything he needs.", "NTA - OP can decide if it bothers her or not.  Of course, if it's at her house, she'll have to do the laundry and probably replace toothbrushes and the like.\n\nShe could also try giving her sister a list, and asking to look it over when she picks up her nephew, or when he's dropped off.", "Exactly. Everyone rushing to defend Carla when all Carla can be bothered to pack is an iPad.", "If shes such a terrible parent nephew probably really need times with his cousin and aunt."]}
