If you enjoy their company and I bet they enjoy yours- ending the sleepovers because Carla is being a shitty parent isn't fair to your nephews. \n\nRather than canceling the sleepovers do not take either child into your home until they have gone through a checklist if they have everything they need. Do it with both kids and their parents so it just seems normal. Eventually if Carla can't get her shit together- her son will because he will know what is expected to be in his bag.\n\nAdditionally things like tooth brushes- you could get a few for your house just in case that stay with you.

Have you always been the family scapegoat? I\u2019m sorry that you are dealing with this and that poor kid. Good luck op.", "NTA, but it seems like this could be solved with less extreme measures. It seems like the issue is Carla gathering everything all at once the night of the sleepover. A reasonable alternative is, on her own dime but at her own pace, provide a set of needed items to stay at your house, and keep sleepovers suspended until that\u2019s done. Once that\u2019s in place, resume and use those items at your house if necessary. Your nephew is family and the sleepovers happen regularly, so it\u2019s not outlandish to have those items for him. They are relatively small and relatively durable. And you only take on the very minor extra work of laundering a set or two extra of clothes each month. And there\u2019s no drop off in comfort or safety for your nephew.\n\nShould this be necessary? No. But you love your nephew, it sounds like you otherwise enjoy the sleepovers, and it seems like the ideal behavior from Carla isn\u2019t likely to happen anytime soon.", "INFO why do you drive to get the stuff instead of insisting either she or your brother come back with the missing items?", "NTA, however I think a much better solution would be to buy all the essentials to keep at your house in a drawer. Your sister isn\u2019t going to wake up one day and not have ADHD, so better to just be proactive and have the stuff already. Nothing fancy or over the top. One outfit, underwear, socks, one set of PJ, toothbrush etc. I think your sister should be the one who purchases it all, but I guess you\u2019ll have to decide that for yourself.", "NTA but you should have made her make the trip to bring the missing stuff. You shouldn't have to drive all the way to her place to fix her mistake. \n\nIf you choose to continue sleepovers, SHE has to make the trip a second time.

Direct, natural consequences are the best way for an ADHDer to learn that they need better management skills.", "If you love your nephews, this is going to hurt them and you.

No. But it would be a nice way to support your nephew.", "I am going to go out on a limb.\n\nPartially, YTA.\n\nADHD symptoms include a poor working memory and poor time management skills.

A toothbrush is a common thing to forget for a whole lot of people. Keep a spare set from the dollar store for your visiting nephews.

I thought this was the fairest thing for me to do.", "Being fair to both...not showing favoritism to the brother's kid.", "At first I thought the same thing, but why should this be OPs responsibility to provide more for these children than they already are?", "I could agree with your point if this was something that happened only once or maybe twice but several times, including one where he only had an iPad? She knows this is a problem and it doesn't sound like sister has done much to fix it. There's a certain point where you need to wake up and be a responsible parent.", "I was going to say this. My nephews had their own toothbrushes and sleeping clothes at my house when they were younger. If she wanted to keep her nephews she\u2019d do something like that. But she\u2019s NTA for not wanting to, just needs to be honest for the reason.", "Why should she have to PAY to do her sister a FAVOR?!?\n\nNOPE.  As someone else stated, sis can provide the extras.", ">ESH. You are punishing the kids (Because they are the ones who lose out) for your sister's lack of organization. You're an aunt and a sibling who knows how her sister is, so I'm not understanding why you just don't keep spare things for your nephews at your home, so they get to have that time with auntie and that's that.\n\nNo. OP is not the only person who can coordinate sleepovers. Her brother and sister can do it, too.", "why should OP have to provide the basics for a kid that isn't hers? I get it's her nephew, but her sister blaming it every single time on ADHD is such a cop out. Sister knows. She just sounds lazy and unwilling to change since OP takes care of it each time. Buying stuff to keep in the event this happens is just enabling sister's behavior.", "Exactly. I have ADHD and suggested similar in another post. I do the same for my partner's place. I have necessities like a toothbrush, hairbrush.etc kept there and just pack clothes I think I'll need, laptop, and anything for what we've planned that weekend. It saves a lot of stress knowing I have at least necessities there.", "Right like it\u2019s not that hard to have a backpack that\u2019s set up to be the go bag! Keep a set of pajamas, underwear, comfy clothes, and maybe an extra toothbrush and charger if possible. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to OP or her kid, and I\u2019d be worried about that kid going to school and getting screwed over cause his mom is too disorganized to help him out when he\u2019s young. \n\nThat\u2019s exactly how my mom was and it just escalated as I got older. I also have adhd so I have sympathy, but the sympathy runs out when they make it everyone else\u2019s problem", "When you go pick the other nephew up, do you wait in the car, or do you go inside the house/apartment so you can check the bag he is bringing? If you know your sister is that unorganized and you and want to continue the sleepovers, then maybe you need to help her out a bit?", "It\u2019s not favoritism if sister can\u2019t pack the essentials.", "It would definitely enable the sisters shit behavior. Whenever my SIL drops off her kids she ensures they have EVERYTHING. And there\u2019s six of them", "That goes back to my point that it is a real issue for those of us. It also goes to another point. Women have always been underdiagnosed and undertreated for this.\n\nAnd you have demonstrated the lack of knowledge the general public has about the very real challenges we deal with.", "Yeah well like I said, the sister can provide extra pairs of clothes and a toothbrush, I mean toothbrushes are like \u00a31. \n\nPersonally for my own nephews, I don't mind spending money on them, if it means I get to spend time with them why wouldn't you, it's not going to break the bank....\n\nEdit: Also, I wouldn't say spending time with your nephews is doing anyone a favour...", "I could get clothes and toiletries for my niece for $50. Should I have to? No, but I happily spend more than that on her every year anyway.", "She doesn't HAVE to provide them, but this is a family treat that nephew will miss out on through no fault of his own. There will be other opportunities for ADHD mom to get her shit together.  This relationship doesn't have to be corrective for mom, just supportive for nephew.", "It just seemed like a simple solution that catered to their family members. She shouldnt have to but its not such a big ask for a family member you enjoy spending time with. No need to get in a family fight over a simple thing. Just bring it up at thanksgiving or something, like i brought the kids box incase sister forgot anything this time. Just deal with it and rib her a bit.", "6 and 7 year old kids will not understand this....  And I doubt OP's agenda is to make her nephew mad at his mom because she messed this up for him/them.", "I am with OP on this one. I would rather spend the money on McDonald\u2019s and toys and movies than toothpaste and socks\u2026 the nephew would probably enjoy it more too\u2026.", "imo it opens the door for the mom to push things further and further. It's such a simple fix for her too. Literally just make a list and pack the bag properly. if mom can't be bothered to do something that simple what other responsibilities is she shirking on? OP already said she still does plenty with both the nephews. Not spending the night once a month isn't going to be the end of the world for them."]}
