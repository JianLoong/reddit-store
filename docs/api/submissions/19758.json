We are expecting around 20-people.  We are splitting the cost of food and beverages with my brother and his wife.  During the planning process, I told everyone that I wanted to get the event catered so that no one had to spend a bunch of time in the kitchen cooking for 20 people.  Everyone agreed this was a good idea and I told them I would take care of it.  I placed the catering order last weekend.\n\nMy wife and SIL have been handling the logistics and when I told them the cost of the catering (about $300), my SIL made a comment about that being too high.  I told her it comes to about $15 per person, which is basically getting everyone fed for the price of a fast-food combo meal, but with much better food.  SIL said that we could save a lot of money if we just cooked ourselves instead.\n\nThe reason cost is an issue for SIL is that they just welcomed their second child 2 months ago and I guess they are feeling a bit pinched financially.  I explained to SIL again my reasoning behind wanting it catered because I don't want anyone to be burdened with cooking for a large group and that I will gladly pay a bit more than our fair share if that makes her feel better.  That seemed to ease her mind.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, SIL and my wife continued talking about it and SIL had taken it upon herself to plan an entire meal that we would cook ourselves for half the price of the catering order.  Without discussing anything with me, they decided to cancel the catering order and just cook ourselves.  My wife told me this last night.  \n\nWhen my wife told me their plan, I asked them who would be doing the cooking and she said me and her because SIL and my brother would probably have to be watching their kids.  I told her that since she and SIL made this decision on their own, I am not going to help with the cooking at all.  I said I would gladly watch the kids while my wife and SIL cook the entire meal for everyone.  \n\nShe told me that I am being a jerk and sexist if I think that I can just refuse to help and make the women do all the cooking.  I told her that she and SIL are the ones who went behind my back and canceled the catering order so they get to be the ones who figure the new plan out, but I'm not helping.  \n\nShe said that SIL was concerned about the cost and that SIL confessed she was worried about money.  I told her that's exactly why I had offered to pay more, but apparently that wasn't enough and that SIL and my wife just needed to be in control of this for some reason.  She told me I need to be more understanding of my brother and SIL's financial situation and that cooking isn't that big of a deal, especially when we can all save some money.  \n\nI told her that since it's not a big deal, she and SIL will have no problem spending as much time as it takes to cook for everyone while I will entertain the rest of the guests.  She told me I'm being an unreasonable AH for not helping.", "created_utc": 1686856664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14aaoss/aita_for_refusing_to_help_cook_after_my_wife/", "score": 4924, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You offered to contribute more. They should have accepted your kind offer, or at least have included you in their decision making.", "NTA - Wow.  Yeahhhhh I think SIL and BIL should help cook for sure.", "NTA\nThe people who canceled the catering order should do the cooking and not disturb anyone else. They can ask for help but if it\u2019s refused they need to accept it in good grace.\n\nDid they not have a plan for how to tackle this meal for 20+ people? As my grandmother used to say \u201cpenny wise pound foolish\u201d.", "NTA even a little bit.  Your wife and SIL however? Big time A", "nta, i\u2019d opt out of party by then", "Well I guess she FAFO. Now she\u2019s going to have to cook either with her sil or by herself. You were even willing to pony up more money but they went behind your back. That\u2019s on them. You are not the asshole but she and sil sure are!", "[removed]", "NTA \n\nThey decided \u201cIt is cheaper for us to cook. We will just cancel the catering and cook.\u201d So now they get to cook.", "Can we also talk about how they screwed the catering company if they cancelled it that soon to the party? Depending o. The company? They probably allotted budget, time, staff etc. 300 total, 15 a head is actually incredibly cheap. \n\nHowever they worked out the cost, I bet you it will be more due to astronomical grocery prices \u2026not including the labor.  \n\nA lot of catering companies get bulk groceries/ingredients for a fraction of the commercial market price.", "Easy NTA.  Your plan was just fine.  Your wife and SIL made this decision by themselves.  They can cook.  That was rude as fuck for your wife to basically volunteer you to cook for 20 people.  You offered to pay more due to your SIL's financial situation which was a perfectly reasonable solution.  Your wife is also out of line by bringing sexism into this when it has nothing to do with it.\n\nCooking for 20 people is a huge undertaking.  Ridiculous.", "NTA - But I believe that your wife is. I'm on the fence if your SIL an AH because she may not have known that your wife was going behind your back and not including you in the plans, but she also made the plans knowing that she really wasn't going to be doing the cooking. So it was more of We can save the cooking if You guys cook, than if WE cook. Your wife should have been including you about the plans, definitely if they were changing the plan and expected for you to participate. You knew that your bro and SIL might be short on money and in return were willing to cover more of the cost of the catering. And honestly you are completely right that you would be feeding people for almost the price of fast food meal combo. Lastly, if you truly were being \"sexist\" you wouldn't have volunteered to watch the children while they cook. If none of the food has been brought yet maybe you can go back to the original plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add: If it was me and food hadn't been bought yet to make a point and be petty I would send an invoice for my services, which would be higher than the original catering. And then say that's my fee for catering. Now, would you like to go with the original agreed uponplan or the bullshit that you decided to come up with by yourselves..... But I mean I'm very petty like that lol", "NTA - This entitlement is killing me.", "NTA Your wife and SIL went behind your back, canceled your plan, and it was very reasonable of you to put them in charge of executing their plan without your help. Also I agree with your logic that since it\u2019s not a big deal to cook for 20 people in their opinion, they should have no problem doing so.", "NTA. \n\nBut your wife and SIL are another matter. How dare they cancel your plans and demand you cook. Fuck them. Stick to your guns and do nothing to help.", "Wife and SIL's logic makes no sense. If their cooked meal is half the price of catering ($150 vs $300), then SIL and Brother are saving $75. And since you offered to pay more, they would be saving even more than that (depending on exactly how much you would have paid). \n\nSo they made hours of work for 2 people (and volunteered you for the work), to save SIL somewhere between $0 and $75.\n\nDefinitely NTA. In that situation I wouldn't even offer to watch the kids. Brother can watch the kids and SIL and wife can cook.", "You are easily NTA, but your wife is a major AH for trying to play the sexism card.  That\u2019s just shitty\u2026", "NTA. You offered to pay more for catering, which I think is reasonable since everyone was originally in agreement. Your SIL and wife went and cancelled the catering and expect you to join in on cooking. You're willing to watch the kids while they cook since this was their idea which is fair.", "NTA I would have loved to have seen your wife\u2019s face when you told her you weren\u2019t helping. I\u2019m glad you have put your foot down. Good job!", "NTA- SHE cancelled the catering order, so she gets to cook. Has nothing to do with her being female.  She and SIL made a choice that effects everyone else.", "NAH - you made plans so no one had to cook. They cancelled plans - but can't expect you to take on the cooking when you had already organised things so you would be free. \n\nIf you wanted to cook for 20 people you would have organised a menu. You didn't, so you organised a caterer. They cancelled it wothout even discussing it with you so they took on the task of cooking.", "NTA.  Saving money is one thing, but after you had helped plan and organize this, they took it upon themselves to cancel the catering order.  And then they didn't tell you about it until now.  It honestly does not sound like they're saving a huge amount of money, either, which doesn't seem worth it when you consider the amount of work they'll likely put into preparing that much food.  And if you offered to pay a larger portion of the catering bill, that should have offset your SIL's concerns.\n\nYou got put in the exact situation you were planning to avoid, and now you're being asked to put in the work, along with your wife, while the person with the largest issue (SIL) isn't even going to help at all.  NTA, I would refuse as well.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife and SIL unilaterally made this decision, they can unilaterally take responsibility for it. Does your wife often play the victim and immediately claim sexism for other issues too?", "NTA", "Your wife and SIL have got to be kidding me. They made their choice and now they can deal with the consequences for said choice. Your wife fell for SIL bs and frankly I don\u2019t feel bad for them. SIL knew she would need to watch her kids, therefore leaving you and your wife to do all the work. She\u2019s an even bigger AH for that. NTA", "ESH. \n\n\n300 isn\u2019t bad cost wise but if they\u2019re chipping in then it should have been discussed with all parties. I\u2019m guessing there are other financial costs included? They probably shouldn\u2019t have agreed to do a joint party tbh or budget should have been agreed on by all parties.\n\n\n300 isn\u2019t a lot but it can add up say if venue is like 1000, paper is another 50, cake is another 60, decorations, etc, \n\n\nCanceling is not cool and roping you into cooking is ridiculous. Plus what happens if you screw it up and give people food poisoning or ruin the food? That\u2019s how people get sick.", "INFO: was SIL involved in the process of approving the catering initially? How much was the 'a bit more' than your fair share that you were willing to pay? \n\nIf making it themselves cost half of the catering, so 150, splitting the cost in half between your household and SIL's household would be 75 each. Otherwise, splitting the cost of catering would be 150 each. Would you have been willing to pay the 225, so that they'd only be paying the 75 they would've had to pay anyway if they made the food themselves? \n\n\nEither way, the party is for your mom, not your wife's mom or you SIL's mom. That makes me lean slightly towards YTA, since it seems kinda rude to just opt out and refuse to participate in cooking for your own mom's party, while making it the problem of your wife and her sister who aren't related to her. Or honestly, ESH, since they're also assholes for getting so involved and making changes to a party regarding someone who they're not related to themselves. \n\nAlso, what would you do if SIL just refuses to cook at all, using her children as an excuse? Just let your wife cook everything by herself? Then you'd probably be TA, especially since her sister was the one taking charge and guilt tripping her to the extent where she cancelled the order. \n\n\nOverall, you may not be TA, but the adult thing to do here would probably just be communicating with your wife and letting her know how it makes you feel, making sure it doesn't happen again, and then helping with the cooking in order to give your mom a nice celebration. This isn't really about you, ultimately, it's about her. And it's honestly not worth it to make such a big deal about this kind of situation, sure it's kind of a rude thing of her to do, but it's family, and sometimes with family you just gotta bite your tongue and deal with it for the sake of keeping the peace. You said it yourself that you know SIL is under a lot of stress and just had a new kid, only two months ago, they're probably frazzled out of their minds. Hopefully things will get better in the future once they've had time to calm down and can think a bit more clearly, rather than having to worry about everything around them, including financial issues.", "ESH, first your wife, then you, and the least your SIL (mostly because we have little info on her side, and going behind your back is something your wife should stop)\n\nYour wife and SIL expect you to put more work in, without asking you first. I can get why SIL didnt openly say how little they would want to spend \"just for food\", even more so if after you said you could cover more it was still too much. Still, shouldnt have gone behind your back.\n\nYour whole part of the discussion sounds (from the outside) like \"they either be willing to pay, or they can cook themselves\", and you throwing your wifes arguments right back at her ultimately makes you an AH. Being an AH has nothing to do with who is right.\n\nYour wife promised your work time without consulting you, and is unwilling to see her fault. Instead of trying to look for a compromise she is throwing sexism accusations, ultimately forcing you on the defensive. BOTH of you are AH for letting it escalate, the first one to say \"ok lets calm down a bit\" would be a bit more of an adult.\n\nYou are being petty, dont want to cook out of principle because it was decided behind your back that you should. Would your SIL help if you asked her directly, could your brother help instead of you? you should have a talk about where your boundaries are and why you are SO upset (cancelling without telling you ok, planning you in while cancelling the plans you made not ok), maybe have a toned down version of the talk with your SIL too.\n\nIt boils down to SIL being worried/ashamed(?) on money issues, your wife saying \"yes\" instead of \"let me quickly ask him\" and you seeing it all as \"you\" and \"me\" problems and not as a \"us\" problem, and blowing up on your wife late at night.", "NTA.\n\nWhen they went behind your back to cancel the order, they jointly took on ALL responsibility.\n\nThey don't get to voluntELL you to clean up THEIR 'brilliant idea'.", "YTA. It's a group decision how to handle the catering, you're not a dictator. The majority decided to do home cooking and for understandable reasons - SIL has a young family and doesn't want to spend too much money. Therefore, the plan is now to cook some food for the party - *for your own mother -* and you refusing to help because they didn't go with your plan is incredibly childish. \n\nWhy is cooking some food with your wife for your family such a massive chore for you?", "NTA - cooking for that many people a LOT of work.  Offering to pay more is perfectly reasonable.  Canceling the order that everyone had previously agreed upon is not.", "Nta- you were willing to pay the extra money and are now willing to watch the kids.", "NTA throwing out the sexism card is lazy and obnoxious.

Whatever price she's come up with likely doesn't include incidentals (i.e. she might have factored in meat and vegetables but not the cooking oil, for example, which will add to the final cost).\n\nThe logistics of cooking such a large meal will be tricky unless a lot of the dishes can be prepared well in advance. That requires a lot of storage/fridge space. Having enough dishes, food storage containers, serving platters, oven/stove space will be a chore.\n\nRegardless of whether you end up helping or not, it's going to be a lot of work.

If they want to cancel the catering order without your knowledge, they can\u2019t expect you to take on the responsibility of cooking especially when you specifically said you wanted to get it catered to avoid that for everyone. It\u2019s not sexist to expect them to do the cooking when they\u2019re the ones that went over your head and canceled the catering order - it would be same situation if two men made that decision. (And honestly, I find it hard to believe that with how expensive groceries are lately, that they would be able to buy enough ingredients to feed that many people for significantly less than $300.

Not even improbably, basically impossible unless you plan to feed them all cheap Ramen and Kraft Dinner.", "Honestly they probably just trusted that since she was his wife, he must have agreed.\n\nIt\u2019s surprising how many times I\u2019ve heard stories of people getting their catering/venue cancelled because a relative called in and said to cancel it.", "I'm spending an extra $20 on me tonight because I just don't feel like cooking it cleaning. Ops wife is a bonehead at that price.", "Oh ya, there is definitely something wrong with their plan. They are either going to have really shitty food, run out of food early, or the budget will balloon to damn near $300.", "it's grad season, and I work in a grocery store.  $400 and up had been common the past few weeks even with holiday and summer specials.  and like you said, that's teen friendly burgers and dogs, not adult celebration fare.", "Instant Ramen and water for 20 people! That\u2019s like $20 Done! So much money saved!", "I just recently cooked good food for 20-30ish people at right around $100 for a graduation party of a family member. It\u2019s possible, but it does require planning ahead. \n\n$20 for a 13lb Boston butt ($1.50/lb), $50 for a 14lb prime brisket ($3.50/lb), and the remaining $30-40 on buns, barbecue sauce, macaroni, and a block of cheese. Put the pork butt and brisket into my smoker the night before to cook and someone else did the macaroni and cheese the night of. Ended up with 15-20lbs of pulled pork/brisket and more than enough macaroni and cheese for everyone to have their fill of everything. \n\nIf you\u2019re trying to provide a more expanded menu with multiple different choices and sides, however, the costs start to add up for sure. Some meals are both really tasty and quite cost effective though.", "And you need things to put the food in , they will probably end up spending a bunch of extra money on disposable aluminum trays at a minimum.", "Not to mention, the cooks will likely be exhausted and cranky and not inclined to enjoy the food they've been labouring over. \n\nHave either of them ever cooked for 20 people before? Even if you're making casserole kind of things which you can more easily make in bulk and a day or two ahead of time, it's still a LOT of work.", "I always end up paying more because i get good quality ingredients. Catering usually have ingredients already or get the in bulk so its cheaper and lesser quality. Try a supermarket and they\u2019d be doomed!\n\nEdit: typo", "At $200 for 20 I'd honestly worry about people going hungry, that won't buy a lot.", "I cannot see how 100 bucks can cover a 20-person meal.  No way.", "$300 for 20 people honestly sounds like a steal.", "And you can\u2019t even calculate the missed time with family and loved ones.", "Even if it isn't, all they're saving is labor costs, they are valuing their own time at zero.", "I completely forgot about the clean up at the end \ud83e\udd2f", "what do you even cook for 20 people in a normal kitchen on one day's notice? That's not even enough time to thaw a turkey. I occasionally cook whole blue fin tuna. Four of those bad boys barely fit in my oven and that can serve 16, maybe", "Yeah, it\u2019s half the price because\u2026 no labour costs! I hope the wife enjoys cooking, because I don\u2019t see SIL actually being willing to help.", "I literally cannot imagine having the gall to cancel someone\u2019s catering order without even offering to do the cooking in replacement, I\u2019m completely at a loss for words about that. Christ.\n\nNTA.", "It's just so dumb because if SIL had taken OP up on the offer to pay more than half, the cost could have been exactly the same. And OP's rationale for hiring a caterer was a very good one, too! Definitely NTA! Don't let your wife pull the sexist card. If she hadn't canceled, no one would be cooking.", "If OP booked the caterer, then why not call the caterer to confirm arrangements? Other people not party to the contract can't just call and cancel on someone else's behalf. The caterer might be confused because SIL has called,.but essentially, someone who isn't party to the contract can't call and cancel the contract.", "Yes the wife got played by the SIL", "No ways. I would ask my brother if he wants to split it. I don\u2019t hear anyone asking him about his opinion. Maybe he feels the same as OP?", "This is the best comment and the wisest choice for peace in the family.", "I think this is the best idea\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "That\u2019s because wife is being \u201cunderstanding\u201d of SIL and their situation!\n\n/s\n\nSomething -something Setting OP on fire to warm SIL", "OP's wife is both a pushover and clearly not bright lol.", "*high-fives in leftist pansexual LGBTQ+-positive using-the-damn-pronouns-people-damn-want*", "In what way?", "Really hard! You have to plan meticulously, and there's no room for error. You mess up any part of it, that item and anything that is dependent on it is now off the menu.", "That's a complex multi-course meal with generally specific dish requirements (like a large finnicky bird), usually if you're cooking for 20 you plan around that rather than starting with a default meal and having to make it work for 20 people. So something like bulk lasagna or other single dish casseroles, bbq/burgers/hotdogs, taco bar. Still $300 is less money and effort than would go into that in my area easily.", "If it takes a fuckload of time for 5 people cooking, how does $300 compare to minimum wage? If you enjoy it fair enough, but if not then it's really not worth the effort.", "Yes because now the catering company will add an inconvenience fee to the price. I would!", "Good for you!  Let wife and SIL cook", "If you feel like it (you don't have to at all) I am curious as to the different menu. Would you mind mentioning that? Ie what was the catering dinner food items vs. What their plan for food was to drop the cost that much? \n\nGood luck my congratulations to the retiree!\n\nEdited to add- this is called being voluntold. No one (that I know) likes being voluntold.", "Please update us after the party!", "I mean I would assume either half of a couple throwing a party would be the default people able to cancel that party. It would seem much weirder to confirm like one of them isn't a grown adult capable of making decisions. Now a relative that shouldn't have equal decision making status is a different story, but a spouse in a normal functional relationship does have equal decision making status (which the wife used to make a decision that makes seemingly no sense from any angle in this case).", "If a relative called and canceled and I owned a catering place what should I even do? \n\nIf I don\u2019t cancel the order and show up with the food they probably won\u2019t pay me, and I\u2019ll have wasted all that money.", "This, yeah. Casserole is doable on their budget, but it\u2019s still a lot of work.", "And where are you gonna store that mountain of food? Especially in summer pretty much everything besides like maybe some desserts and some appetizers needs to be refrigerated. Or good luck trying to cook food for 20 people in one day with two people.

Not a lot; this\u2019ll be heavy on sides and low on meat. \n\nCan be either a stew or casserole if you add cheese.", "It's possible if you're just cooking basic normal food, like $5/meal is very reasonable for a family's standard grocery budget. But it won't be what we generally think of as \"party food\".", "Only way it's under that and fairly easy to make is if it's all baked ziti and salad bought at a bulk store, but they will still go over after you add in the trays and heaters needed.", "Clean up before *and* after ugh", "Yeah but she is probably too proud to accept the money, that is the problem.", "If they know the name of the event, date, cost, etc, yes, they'd be able to call and cancel. They don't actually have to be OP, what is the caterer going to do, ID them over the phone?

It\u2019s so prevalent for weddings that the couple getting married will often set up passwords with the caterers (and florists and venues, etc.)", "\"Why should I pay for strangers to cook when I have a perfectly good wife right here.\"", "The catering order was for a pita party platter with salads.  The new menu is frozen pita packs from Aldi, finger sandwiches, a sh!tload of homemade macaroni salad, and homemade cookies.", "In general businesses like this are not Boeing dealing with a potential 200 million dollar deal on jet engines. \n\nIt\u2019s not worth it in any way shape or form to confirm someone calling with knowledge of a specific order to cancel is who they say they are or \u201cauthorized\u201d to make that call. \n\nIf you know of peoples orders and the details and want to cancel things you generally can. \n\nWeird thing to do but it is what it is.", "I'm still traumatised from a Thanksgiving dinner, which went from a dozen people to 30 two days before the night and ended up being 50.

Just finding fridge space and getting everything reheated was massive pain.", "Typo lol  ^good", "Still would exceed 100 dollars, easily.  I just spent 6 dollars on a pound of grapes at a regular supermarket.  Prices are through the roof these days. \n\nFor 20 folks, you will be paying more than 100 dollars.", "Idk if you live in the middle of nowhere where stuff is really cheap but anywhere around a major city and grocery prices will not be low enough to do $100 for 20 people, not even close.

The other one sounds like you are going to run out of fridge space.", "True enough, I deal with food orders well in excess of $300 every day and we'll cancel an order for anyone who calls with the info. Hell we're supposed to check for an authorized ID when we give out the orders, but no one even bothers with that, if you ask for the order that's good enough for a low wage worker.", ">*went from a dozen people to 30 two days before the night and ended up being 50*\n\nHoly...\n\nThe only thing I would have made for that Thanksgiving was reservations!"]}
