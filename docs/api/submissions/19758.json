We are expecting around 20-people.  We are splitting the cost of food and beverages with my brother and his wife.  During the planning process, I told everyone that I wanted to get the event catered so that no one had to spend a bunch of time in the kitchen cooking for 20 people.  Everyone agreed this was a good idea and I told them I would take care of it.  I placed the catering order last weekend.\n\nMy wife and SIL have been handling the logistics and when I told them the cost of the catering (about $300), my SIL made a comment about that being too high.  I told her it comes to about $15 per person, which is basically getting everyone fed for the price of a fast-food combo meal, but with much better food.  SIL said that we could save a lot of money if we just cooked ourselves instead.\n\nThe reason cost is an issue for SIL is that they just welcomed their second child 2 months ago and I guess they are feeling a bit pinched financially.  I explained to SIL again my reasoning behind wanting it catered because I don't want anyone to be burdened with cooking for a large group and that I will gladly pay a bit more than our fair share if that makes her feel better.  That seemed to ease her mind.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, SIL and my wife continued talking about it and SIL had taken it upon herself to plan an entire meal that we would cook ourselves for half the price of the catering order.  Without discussing anything with me, they decided to cancel the catering order and just cook ourselves.  My wife told me this last night.  \n\nWhen my wife told me their plan, I asked them who would be doing the cooking and she said me and her because SIL and my brother would probably have to be watching their kids.  I told her that since she and SIL made this decision on their own, I am not going to help with the cooking at all.  I said I would gladly watch the kids while my wife and SIL cook the entire meal for everyone.  \n\nShe told me that I am being a jerk and sexist if I think that I can just refuse to help and make the women do all the cooking.  I told her that she and SIL are the ones who went behind my back and canceled the catering order so they get to be the ones who figure the new plan out, but I'm not helping.  \n\nShe said that SIL was concerned about the cost and that SIL confessed she was worried about money.  I told her that's exactly why I had offered to pay more, but apparently that wasn't enough and that SIL and my wife just needed to be in control of this for some reason.  She told me I need to be more understanding of my brother and SIL's financial situation and that cooking isn't that big of a deal, especially when we can all save some money.  \n\nI told her that since it's not a big deal, she and SIL will have no problem spending as much time as it takes to cook for everyone while I will entertain the rest of the guests.  She told me I'm being an unreasonable AH for not helping.", "created_utc": 1686856664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14aaoss/aita_for_refusing_to_help_cook_after_my_wife/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You offered to contribute more. They should have accepted your kind offer, or at least have included you in their decision making.", "NTA - Wow.  Yeahhhhh I think SIL and BIL should help cook for sure.", "NTA\nThe people who canceled the catering order should do the cooking and not disturb anyone else. They can ask for help but if it\u2019s refused they need to accept it in good grace.\n\nDid they not have a plan for how to tackle this meal for 20+ people? As my grandmother used to say \u201cpenny wise pound foolish\u201d.", "NTA even a little bit.  Your wife and SIL however? Big time A", "nta, i\u2019d opt out of party by then", "Well I guess she FAFO. Now she\u2019s going to have to cook either with her sil or by herself. You were even willing to pony up more money but they went behind your back. That\u2019s on them. You are not the asshole but she and sil sure are!", "[removed]", "NTA \n\nThey decided \u201cIt is cheaper for us to cook. We will just cancel the catering and cook.\u201d So now they get to cook.", "Can we also talk about how they screwed the catering company if they cancelled it that soon to the party? Depending o. The company? They probably allotted budget, time, staff etc. 300 total, 15 a head is actually incredibly cheap. \n\nHowever they worked out the cost, I bet you it will be more due to astronomical grocery prices \u2026not including the labor.  \n\nA lot of catering companies get bulk groceries/ingredients for a fraction of the commercial market price.", "Easy NTA.  Your plan was just fine.  Your wife and SIL made this decision by themselves.  They can cook.  That was rude as fuck for your wife to basically volunteer you to cook for 20 people.  You offered to pay more due to your SIL's financial situation which was a perfectly reasonable solution.  Your wife is also out of line by bringing sexism into this when it has nothing to do with it.\n\nCooking for 20 people is a huge undertaking.  Ridiculous.", "NTA - But I believe that your wife is. I'm on the fence if your SIL an AH because she may not have known that your wife was going behind your back and not including you in the plans, but she also made the plans knowing that she really wasn't going to be doing the cooking. So it was more of We can save the cooking if You guys cook, than if WE cook. Your wife should have been including you about the plans, definitely if they were changing the plan and expected for you to participate. You knew that your bro and SIL might be short on money and in return were willing to cover more of the cost of the catering. And honestly you are completely right that you would be feeding people for almost the price of fast food meal combo. Lastly, if you truly were being \"sexist\" you wouldn't have volunteered to watch the children while they cook. If none of the food has been brought yet maybe you can go back to the original plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add: If it was me and food hadn't been bought yet to make a point and be petty I would send an invoice for my services, which would be higher than the original catering. And then say that's my fee for catering. Now, would you like to go with the original agreed uponplan or the bullshit that you decided to come up with by yourselves..... But I mean I'm very petty like that lol", "NTA - This entitlement is killing me.", "NTA Your wife and SIL went behind your back, canceled your plan, and it was very reasonable of you to put them in charge of executing their plan without your help. Also I agree with your logic that since it\u2019s not a big deal to cook for 20 people in their opinion, they should have no problem doing so.", "NTA. \n\nBut your wife and SIL are another matter. How dare they cancel your plans and demand you cook. Fuck them. Stick to your guns and do nothing to help.", "Wife and SIL's logic makes no sense. If their cooked meal is half the price of catering ($150 vs $300), then SIL and Brother are saving $75. And since you offered to pay more, they would be saving even more than that (depending on exactly how much you would have paid). \n\nSo they made hours of work for 2 people (and volunteered you for the work), to save SIL somewhere between $0 and $75.\n\nDefinitely NTA. In that situation I wouldn't even offer to watch the kids. Brother can watch the kids and SIL and wife can cook.", "You are easily NTA, but your wife is a major AH for trying to play the sexism card.  That\u2019s just shitty\u2026", "NTA. You offered to pay more for catering, which I think is reasonable since everyone was originally in agreement. Your SIL and wife went and cancelled the catering and expect you to join in on cooking. You're willing to watch the kids while they cook since this was their idea which is fair.", "NTA I would have loved to have seen your wife\u2019s face when you told her you weren\u2019t helping. I\u2019m glad you have put your foot down. Good job!", "NTA- SHE cancelled the catering order, so she gets to cook. Has nothing to do with her being female.  She and SIL made a choice that effects everyone else.", "NAH - you made plans so no one had to cook. They cancelled plans - but can't expect you to take on the cooking when you had already organised things so you would be free. \n\nIf you wanted to cook for 20 people you would have organised a menu. You didn't, so you organised a caterer. They cancelled it wothout even discussing it with you so they took on the task of cooking.", "NTA.  Saving money is one thing, but after you had helped plan and organize this, they took it upon themselves to cancel the catering order.  And then they didn't tell you about it until now.  It honestly does not sound like they're saving a huge amount of money, either, which doesn't seem worth it when you consider the amount of work they'll likely put into preparing that much food.  And if you offered to pay a larger portion of the catering bill, that should have offset your SIL's concerns.\n\nYou got put in the exact situation you were planning to avoid, and now you're being asked to put in the work, along with your wife, while the person with the largest issue (SIL) isn't even going to help at all.  NTA, I would refuse as well.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife and SIL unilaterally made this decision, they can unilaterally take responsibility for it. Does your wife often play the victim and immediately claim sexism for other issues too?", "NTA", "Your wife and SIL have got to be kidding me. They made their choice and now they can deal with the consequences for said choice. Your wife fell for SIL bs and frankly I don\u2019t feel bad for them. SIL knew she would need to watch her kids, therefore leaving you and your wife to do all the work. She\u2019s an even bigger AH for that. NTA", "ESH. \n\n\n300 isn\u2019t bad cost wise but if they\u2019re chipping in then it should have been discussed with all parties. I\u2019m guessing there are other financial costs included? They probably shouldn\u2019t have agreed to do a joint party tbh or budget should have been agreed on by all parties.\n\n\n300 isn\u2019t a lot but it can add up say if venue is like 1000, paper is another 50, cake is another 60, decorations, etc, \n\n\nCanceling is not cool and roping you into cooking is ridiculous. Plus what happens if you screw it up and give people food poisoning or ruin the food? That\u2019s how people get sick.", "INFO: was SIL involved in the process of approving the catering initially? How much was the 'a bit more' than your fair share that you were willing to pay? \n\nIf making it themselves cost half of the catering, so 150, splitting the cost in half between your household and SIL's household would be 75 each. Otherwise, splitting the cost of catering would be 150 each. Would you have been willing to pay the 225, so that they'd only be paying the 75 they would've had to pay anyway if they made the food themselves? \n\n\nEither way, the party is for your mom, not your wife's mom or you SIL's mom. That makes me lean slightly towards YTA, since it seems kinda rude to just opt out and refuse to participate in cooking for your own mom's party, while making it the problem of your wife and her sister who aren't related to her. Or honestly, ESH, since they're also assholes for getting so involved and making changes to a party regarding someone who they're not related to themselves. \n\nAlso, what would you do if SIL just refuses to cook at all, using her children as an excuse? Just let your wife cook everything by herself? Then you'd probably be TA, especially since her sister was the one taking charge and guilt tripping her to the extent where she cancelled the order. \n\n\nOverall, you may not be TA, but the adult thing to do here would probably just be communicating with your wife and letting her know how it makes you feel, making sure it doesn't happen again, and then helping with the cooking in order to give your mom a nice celebration. This isn't really about you, ultimately, it's about her. And it's honestly not worth it to make such a big deal about this kind of situation, sure it's kind of a rude thing of her to do, but it's family, and sometimes with family you just gotta bite your tongue and deal with it for the sake of keeping the peace. You said it yourself that you know SIL is under a lot of stress and just had a new kid, only two months ago, they're probably frazzled out of their minds. Hopefully things will get better in the future once they've had time to calm down and can think a bit more clearly, rather than having to worry about everything around them, including financial issues.", "ESH, first your wife, then you, and the least your SIL (mostly because we have little info on her side, and going behind your back is something your wife should stop)\n\nYour wife and SIL expect you to put more work in, without asking you first. I can get why SIL didnt openly say how little they would want to spend \"just for food\", even more so if after you said you could cover more it was still too much. Still, shouldnt have gone behind your back.\n\nYour whole part of the discussion sounds (from the outside) like \"they either be willing to pay, or they can cook themselves\", and you throwing your wifes arguments right back at her ultimately makes you an AH. Being an AH has nothing to do with who is right.\n\nYour wife promised your work time without consulting you, and is unwilling to see her fault. Instead of trying to look for a compromise she is throwing sexism accusations, ultimately forcing you on the defensive. BOTH of you are AH for letting it escalate, the first one to say \"ok lets calm down a bit\" would be a bit more of an adult.\n\nYou are being petty, dont want to cook out of principle because it was decided behind your back that you should. Would your SIL help if you asked her directly, could your brother help instead of you? you should have a talk about where your boundaries are and why you are SO upset (cancelling without telling you ok, planning you in while cancelling the plans you made not ok), maybe have a toned down version of the talk with your SIL too.\n\nIt boils down to SIL being worried/ashamed(?) on money issues, your wife saying \"yes\" instead of \"let me quickly ask him\" and you seeing it all as \"you\" and \"me\" problems and not as a \"us\" problem, and blowing up on your wife late at night.", "NTA.\n\nWhen they went behind your back to cancel the order, they jointly took on ALL responsibility.\n\nThey don't get to voluntELL you to clean up THEIR 'brilliant idea'.", "YTA. It's a group decision how to handle the catering, you're not a dictator. The majority decided to do home cooking and for understandable reasons - SIL has a young family and doesn't want to spend too much money. Therefore, the plan is now to cook some food for the party - *for your own mother -* and you refusing to help because they didn't go with your plan is incredibly childish. \n\nWhy is cooking some food with your wife for your family such a massive chore for you?", "NTA - cooking for that many people a LOT of work.  Offering to pay more is perfectly reasonable.  Canceling the order that everyone had previously agreed upon is not.", "Nta- you were willing to pay the extra money and are now willing to watch the kids.", "NTA throwing out the sexism card is lazy and obnoxious.

But even if you're technically right, sometimes it still isn't worth it to cause a fuss, depending on the circumstances.", "That's good to hear, it's nice to know that the two of you are in it together and supporting eachother. But just out of curiosity, what about the price? And how involved was the SIL in approving of the catering initially? This could've probably been avoided by just saying 'hey, I wanna do catering, it's gonna be about 300', and then the issue would've never had the chance to come up. Not judging you at all, just a tip for future reference.", "I mean yeah, it's a dick move, but it's also kinda lacking in empathy and understanding to just let her do everything anyway. It's her sister being two months post partum and going through a hard time with finances. Of course she's gonna feel pressured and guilty and want to help her sister out\n\n*Not sister, just saw OP's reply :)", "You\u2019re absolutely right. You\u2019ve been nothing but reasonable. It\u2019s a crazy idea to cook for 20 in your own home. It was gracious of you to volunteer to pay more than half. Your wife and SIL created a problem and can\u2019t expect you to solve it.", "The group is 4 people. I can only assume OPs brother was also worried about the cost and agreed with OPs wife and SIL.", "OP seemed to communicated fine. He gave the initial plan and price and when he was met with pushback he offered a compromise. \n\nThe wife and SIL in the other hand who were all about the cooking until the time came to cook at which point they were like \u201cwho wants to cook?\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t see where OPs communications were at fault in this scenario", ">when your wife's sister is 2 months post partum.\n\nNope, my brother's wife.  Honestly, if I would have known this was going to be such a big problem to my brother and SIL, I would have offered to just pay for everything on my own and cut them out of the process completely.  Would have saved me a huge headache.", "When I got the price for the catering, I told everyone the cost before finalizing the order.  No one complained at that time.  It wasn't until a few days after I placed the order that apparently SIL got concerned and talked to my wife about it.", "Then she can be the one to cook with her sister, post partum is not an excuse to cancel someone\u2019s plans that made everything easier for most, to ease the SIL life who then isn\u2019t even going to help with the cooking? \n\nAs you said it\u2019s HIS mother, the sil deserves no sympathy at this point tbh", "OP put in the order before telling them the price, and tried to glaze over the (reasonable) concerns about it instead of trying to find a solution everyone agrees on first. Canceling the order behind OP's back is ruder, but this could've all been avoided by discussing the plan before doing anything.", "Yeah I get ya, it does sound like quite the hassle honestly. Hopefully it works out better next time! I hope you guys manage to figure it out together", "I don't quite get it, you said in your post that when you told them the cost of catering, she made a comment about it being too high? So how could she have known the cost of catering already from the moment you suggested it and before ordering, while also saying it was too high when she heard the price for the first time days later after you'd already ordered?", "I'm not saying it's an excuse for the SIL's behaviour. I'm saying it may be a way to explain why his wife was acting like a pushover and trying to accommodate her.", "OP literally says \u201cduring the planning process I told everyone I wanted to get the event catered\u201d and that \u201ceveryone agreed\u201d. \n\nThat\u2019s not springing anything on anyone. They may not have known the final total amount but they clearly knew it was going to be catered and OP also offered to pay more than half when he got pushback about the price. \n\nThe people who failed at communicating are the ones who cancelled the order with out informing everyone then wanted to impose the work on the  rest of the group.", "Sorry If the way I worded it was confusing.  But I told everyone the price before I finalized the order and no one complained so I placed the order."]}
