Obviously I can talk, I just don\u2019t talk a lot most of the time and I also tend to like quiet solo hobbies.  According to a therapist, I\u2019m not neurodivergent just introverted.  My parents divorced when I was 12 and my mom is no longer in the picture, so I live with my dad.  It was always pretty much understood that I just kind of quietly do my own thing, I do my chores and schoolwork and I\u2019m never in trouble. My dad has always said that I\u2019m the easiest kid.  I get along ok with most people.\n\nThis last spring my dad married his girlfriend Jane, who has two boys (13, 10).  They\u2019re really different than me, they talk all the time, they always want to go out and do things, and it\u2019s just a lot to handle sometimes.  Jane has tried to relate to me, but the way she does it has always come off as really pushy and she really plays up the \u201cus girls\u201d thing a lot, so I usually try to be polite but firm in keeping enough distance there for my own comfort. That was working until they moved in and things have been getting more tense ever since. Now she wants to do \u201cfamily time\u201d a lot and she tries to drag me along to stuff with the boys and gets my dad involved when I say no.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s I spend too much time alone in my room. But if I\u2019m reading or working on something in the living room I\u2019m ignoring everyone and it\u2019s rude. If the boys want to play a game and I say no, I\u2019m hurting their feelings and making them feel unwelcome, but if I play the game and just make my moves without talking much I\u2019m being rude.  If I come along on an outing I\u2019m not paying enough attention. It\u2019s just always something.\n\nShe wanted me to come along to her family holiday party this last weekend and it sounded like pure hell so I said no, I don\u2019t know those people and I would be bored for hours and I want some quiet time to work on a project. My dad tried to talk me into it, I only agreed to go if I drove myself and could leave after an hour, which Jane was ok with at first but then she wanted me to dress up and wear makeup (I hate makeup) so we could get some nice family pictures and I told her absolutely not and I would rather just not go. It turned into an argument and she told me that she had had enough of me being so antisocial and cold and that if I don\u2019t start making an effort to grow out of it, nobody will want anything to do with me when I\u2019m an adult. I just went back to my room and didn\u2019t respond, but my dad asked me to go to the party for the hour without the make up as a compromise. So, I went, spent an hour mostly petting Jane\u2019s parents\u2019 dog, and went home, but heard Jane complaining later that I embarrassed her by being so standoffish and clearly either something is wrong with me or I\u2019m being an AH to her out of spite and jealousy.\n\nI don\u2019t really understand how I\u2019m the AH but this seems to really bother her a lot so I wanted an outside opinion.", "created_utc": 1671747344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsyifn/aita_for_being_antisocial_toward_my_stepfamily/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're clearly trying to compromise, but everything you do is criticized, honestly I'm impressed that you haven't lost your cool and yelled at your new Stepmom.\n\nHave you talked to your dad about this? He should be the one to tell his wife that she needs to lay off, not you. He's the one who chose to marry this woman, he needs to set boundaries with her about how she treats you and clearly tell her you aren't going to change into whatever she seems to want you to be.", "NTA - talk to your dad alone, share with him your feelings and explain it to him like you did here in the third paragraph.  Tell him he always let you do your thing, but his new wife won't treat you the same.  Maybe suggest a counseling session with your therapist for you and dad, and then one that includes her - so that your boundaries can be made and respected...", "NTA\n\nIt's not your fault that she doesn't comprehend or understand being an introvert. Not everyone is a social butterfly.", "No, NTA. It seems everyone can be themselves except you. That is not cool and Jane need to tone her attitude down, I consider her a bully. Your dad is not helping, he is siding with his new wife and you seem to be alone in this. That is not cool either. You are who you are and the one place you should be able to be yourself is in your own home. So do not apologize for who you are, but do stand up for your right to be yourself. Maybe start with your dad, and work your way towards Jane.\n\n\\*edited for typos", "You are NTA. Jane might mean well, but she is being invasive and pushy. Maybe try to find some time to sit down alone with your dad. Tell him you love him and like Jane and her kids well enough, but you are still the same person that enjoys being alone and doesn\u2019t thrive in social situations. Ask him to respect your needs. Just because your family has changed doesn\u2019t mean you have to.", "NTA. It sounds like she wants you to be a certain way and you just aren't. Her expectations should not be made into your problem.  Can you talk to your Dad about it? Maybe get her into some family therapy or something so that she can learn about how to actually \"compromise\" and how to interact with an introvert from someone she might \"hear?\"", "NTA at all! Jane is kinda one. Trust me, you will find plenty of people as you get out that will love you for who you are and not try to change you. Jane sounds like one of those women who always wanted a daughter. So, she is trying to make you into the daughter she always wanted. Don\u2019t play that game. You do you.", "NTA\n\nJane isn't an AH for wanting you to be 'part of the family!' and her wanting a 'family photo' is a perfectly reasonable ask.  It's ok for her to ask that you participate in some things - the hour compromise was good.  But she is being an AH for not seeing you as an individual who thinks differently than herself.  She's certainly reached AH territory by telling you nobody will want to have anything to do with you.  She claims to want a good relationship with you but she's doing the absolute worst things.\n\nThis will likely sound like hell to you - but consider going to 'family therapy' with your Dad & Jane.  The therapist will be a good moderator and help both of you set boundaries, and hopefully they can get it through her head that while you're not done growing up- this is basically You. This isn't a 'phase' you're going through.  It sounds like she's taking everything personally - that your sitting up in your room thinking bad thoughts about her & the boys and if she just pushes you the right way the magic door to your heart will unlock and you'l magically become Typical Teen Daughter.  That's just not the case. You're up there happily doing your own thing.", "NTA she is overbearing.", "NTA - Jane just tries so hard to be the picture perfect family. But this is not how it works.  You are different then her. That does not mean that you don\u2019t like her. But with her behavior she pushes you in a corner that makes your relationship worse every time. I would say talk to your father first about it and after that with him and Jane. \n\nI think it is really grown up that you wanna do compromises. She has to do them to and stick to them. Not push you further. She needs to understand that you are highly introverted. And i understand this so good!", "\"Dear Jane, I am an introvert. That means that I find social activities draining and I recharge through alone time. So I have a low tolerance for social activities, and that tolerance goes even lower when someone tries to push me into doing something I don't feel comfortable doing or they insult me for *trying* to be social. You regularly do both to me, and I want it to stop: if I say no to an activity, do not try to force me to change my mind, and if I agree to go to an activity, I don't want to be accused of being antisocial just because I do not behave like an extrovert would. I treat you with respect, and I would like to be treated with respect in return.\"\n\nNTA. Her behavior is incredibly out of line and disrespectful (and it would be even if she were your biological mother). It's really sad that she is choosing to squander the opportunity to get to know *you* instead of her image of what a teenage girl should be... Especially when I think of all the posts on this sub where kids *do* hate their step parents for no good reason.\n\nAlso, I would encourage you to establish family ground rules regarding the living room: either it is a gathering place where people are allowed to do their own activities (in which case, you are welcome to sit there while you are reading or working on projects) *or* it is reserved for social activities (in which case, she doesn't get to complain that you are spending time in your room). \n\nBTW, you shouldn't have to do this all on your own: your father should be helping you establish boundaries with her. I can't tell if he's actually being an AH or whether he is just being overly passive and foolishly thinking the two of you will work it out amongst yourself, but either way, he's failing at his parental obligations to you", "NTA it sounds like you've already been making an effort to meet them half way, they owe you the same courtesy", "NTA. You clearly tried to establish boundaries which Jane is almost intentionally trying to cross. She is also outright insulting you and to me she sounds like a possible narcissist who is trying to tear down your self-esteem. \n\nI would have a serious conversation in private with your dad about how she is making you feel. And that you need him to have a talk with her that the way she is acting is unacceptable. If she starts to affect your mental health then seek counseling at school.", "Honestly, you sound like a typical teenager.  My 15 year old nephew comes to our holiday party and reads a book in the corner, and we shrug it off because we figure that\u2019s just what he wants to do.  Jane probably doesn\u2019t understand you because the boys aren\u2019t teens yet and they may not be introverts.  She\u2019s in for a whopper of a surprise. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nIf I might make a suggestion, try killing her with kindness.  If she offers something you don\u2019t want to do just say \u201cthank you for offering, but I\u2019d rather not/I\u2019m busy/I\u2019m fine/I\u2019m focused on something else\u201d.   If she persists just keep saying it over (with some variation).  Most people will eventually give up.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. My heart is breaking for you reading your post because it's so clear that you are a sweet girl who just likes her own space. It's wrong of your stepmother to be so pushy and judgmental and please don't believe her because there are plenty of people in the world who will love you just the way you are. I wish your dad would do more to stand up for you because it seems like she's putting you in a position where you're damned if you do damned if you don't and I hate that for you. The fact that you agreed to go to the party and then she tried to pressure you to dress differently or wear makeup I think is outrageously out of line. I don't know if her heart is in the right place or not but she really needs to change her approach with you and I hope you won't let her bring you down too much because you sound great and you deserve to be safe and happy. Good luck and please know that you are wonderful just the way you are.", "NTA. They have unreasonable expectations of you. Your dad needs to understand that you don't exist to make Jane happy.", "NTA There's nothing wrong with not wanting to hang out with people you don't know. There's nothing wrong with not wanting to play games with your stepbrothers. Sounds like your stepmother is not going to be happy with you no matter what you do. It's not your job to meet her high expectations.", "NTA I was you, only the person haranguing me to be \"normal\" was my own mother.  Your offer of the compromise for the christmas family time was excellent, keep trying to do that.  And try to talk to your dad and lay out how you're feeling.  And/or ask to do family therapy.  \n\nIt is OK to be introverted.  It is OK to be extroverted.  It's when the two sides try to force the other side to be them that things go to heck in a handbasket.\n\nLearning how to cope in a fairly outgoing world will be useful as you get older.  I work for a very socializing happy company and have learned my internal signals that I've hit my limits and how to express to my coworkers and friends my needs as well.  Like your compromise.  So I would encourage you to keep learning that art, it is useful skill in life.\n\nI hope the doggy enjoyed the free pettins :)\n\nMy mother used to get sooooooooo mad at me when I'd get a book at a holiday - birthday, christmas, what not - and then \"hide out and be antisocial reading a d\\*\\*\\* book\".", "You are who you are. NTA.", "NTA she's not making you part of the family by trying to bring you along as a prop. Your father is the real asshole though for not standing up to the woman he is in a relationship with for you his kid.", "NTA. I know your frustration. I\u2019m an introvert. My father married a very extroverted woman who had three extroverted daughters and it was overwhelming.\n\nYou\u2019re doing everything you can to meet her halfway and she\u2019s not seeing that at all. I hope you can talk to your dad and that he can then temper her expectations, but if not, college/uni is only a few years away. Best of luck to you.", "You are NOT an a-hole.  You are misunderstood.  I have a couple of questions, and then suggestions based on your responses.\n\n1. Are you still in therapy?\n2. Is your dad aware of what your therapist said to you about being an introvert?\n\nIf you are still in therapy, how do you feel about talking to your therapist about how she might advocate for you with your stepmom and dad?  Perhaps, she could have a session with the three of you, explaining how you are wired, giving some credibility to why you act or don't act in a certain way, explaining the actions they can undergo to support you, and things you could do as well.\n\nIf you are not in therapy, what if you take the time to write a letter to both of them explaining your nature . . . everything sort of you explained in this post which shows that your step mom is misinterpreting everything, and not supporting you.  When you write this letter, make a point to include positive things as well as negative.  You also might consider describing boundaries that make you feel better, or ways in which you do enjoy interacting with them.  If all you feel like you can give is thirty minutes at family dinner to talk and listen, without distractions, then that is NOT nothing.\n\nYOU are allowed to be YOU.  You don't have to make excuses for NOT being YOU.  You don't have to be forced into acting in any way that is NOT you.\n\nHowever, do remember that life is about compromises.  If you act solely, each and every time based only on what benefits you, there likely could be some negative consequences that go along with the positive.  But that is for you to think through and accept or reject.\n\nFor example, if you like the idea of having step brothers that you might develop a sibling-type relationship with, then it might require doing things with them that they enjoy too, though those things might not always be your favorite.  They, in turn, might have to do something you would enjoy.  You like to do solitary things, but maybe picking a project that you need help with, could be a way to engage in an activity you enjoy, but with them. Make sure that if you go that route, it is something that you don't mind if they make mistakes.\n\nAgain, you are entitled to be a makeup-free, introvert who likes solitary projects.  In fact, I think the way you describe yourself is great.  If you don't need to build strong family relationships, then that is ok, but try to project your feelings out, anticipating what you want out of relationships not just in the moment, but in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Giving op space to just be there and interact on her own time could've been a good start, but Jane just chooses to berate Op's efforts.

I've been in ops shoes but the difference is I had a mom who understood that me being quiet but being in the room was my way trying to be there, even if I was uncomfortable and not really interacting with anyone. Did she berate me for it? No, she appreciated my effort, gave me time and space and I grew to be comfortable or open to trying all types of situations and can now talk/meet new people usually without or at least with minimal discomfort.

I don\u2019t like the shows or movies they watch, but I\u2019ve sat there and watched them and been bored out of my skull, she doesn\u2019t like that I don\u2019t talk during them.

Your Dad's wife clearly sees anything short of 100% conforming and compliance as disrespectful, cold, anti-social. She is completely ignoring all of your attempts at compromise. It's disappointing that your dad either doesn't know you well enough to play translator for you or is ignoring all he knows about you to make his wife happy.
