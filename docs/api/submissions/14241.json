Beg pardon? Stick a cramps simulator on that jackass and turn it on high. \n\nAnd he can\u2019t have it both ways. If you are going to be responsible for the kids, you also have to have the authority to make judgment calls when it comes to their welfare. If he doesn\u2019t agree, that should be a deal killer because being both responsible and powerless will lead to burnout and resentment.", "NTA, if he doesn't trust you to occasionally make parenting decisions for the children, he shouldn't give you parenting duties for the children. He wants his rules followed in a situation where you can't get ahold of him? He shouldn't have left them with you. There are plenty of medical issues that do not involve getting fevers. Personally, I have multiple chronic illnesses that cause me extreme pain, migraines, etc. and not a single one of those conditions will trigger a fever. If my parents tried to enforce a \"fever only\" policy I would have likely triggered issues with the school from consistent trips to the nurse when I should have been kept home.\n\nI suggest you sit down with him and discuss your role in the children's lives. If he decides that you make may no decisions without his explicit say so or following his very limited and specific rules, then I advise you remove yourself from the morning routine. He can hire a nanny or get his own children ready for school, or he can let you make in the moment decisions about his children's health.\n\nAdditionally, if she has painful enough cramps to need to miss school, I strongly advise you to encourage him to take her to a doctor. Cramps are supposed to be uncomfortable and mildly painful, but extreme pain is often a sign of more severe medical situations than standard PMS cramps. Obviously take medical advice from Reddit with a grain of salt, but it's definitely worth getting looked at.", "NTA. If you aren't allowed to make decisions, he should make other arrangements for getting his kids off to school.  Either you are parenting or you are not.", "NTA. You mentioned that the kids generally do not try to play sick, and menstrual cramps can be BAD. Since he has seen fit to give you parental style duties, and to make various other decisions in his absence, I don\u2019t see how this decision was outside of the realm. Kid was in pain, you allowed her to stay home and sleep it off/gave midol. He may be a good dad, but he has no knowledge of menstrual cramps first hand. This is not a \u201cyou\u2019re not a parent, do you dunno\u201d situation. It\u2019s a \u201cdad doesn\u2019t get it\u201d situation.", "NTA.

Your boyfriend leaves you in charge of his kids, which means you are acting in loco parentis. If the girl doesn't have a history of trying to beg off of school, then she must have been in a lot of pain. You made the right call.

I have missed more work, school, and life events for period-related things than illness because they cramps and pain can be absolutely debilitating. I\u2019ve thrown up more because of endometriosis than the flu, by far. I hope for his daughter\u2019s sake this isn\u2019t the beginning of something like endometriosis or PCOS because he sounds like an absolute AH when it comes to this part of life. Please continue to fight for his daughter, but also recognize that his rigid policy is absolutely sexist and that says a lot about who he is.", "NTA. I used to force myself to do things like go to school, attend sports practice, etc while having cramps and ended up being sent to the hospital a few times. Cramps are no joke.

She suffered terribly - from the pain but above all from the fact that her mother didn't believe her!\n\nMy mother never did that to us. She always said \"what could happen?
