Beg pardon? Stick a cramps simulator on that jackass and turn it on high. \n\nAnd he can\u2019t have it both ways. If you are going to be responsible for the kids, you also have to have the authority to make judgment calls when it comes to their welfare. If he doesn\u2019t agree, that should be a deal killer because being both responsible and powerless will lead to burnout and resentment.", "NTA, if he doesn't trust you to occasionally make parenting decisions for the children, he shouldn't give you parenting duties for the children. He wants his rules followed in a situation where you can't get ahold of him? He shouldn't have left them with you. There are plenty of medical issues that do not involve getting fevers. Personally, I have multiple chronic illnesses that cause me extreme pain, migraines, etc. and not a single one of those conditions will trigger a fever. If my parents tried to enforce a \"fever only\" policy I would have likely triggered issues with the school from consistent trips to the nurse when I should have been kept home.\n\nI suggest you sit down with him and discuss your role in the children's lives. If he decides that you make may no decisions without his explicit say so or following his very limited and specific rules, then I advise you remove yourself from the morning routine. He can hire a nanny or get his own children ready for school, or he can let you make in the moment decisions about his children's health.\n\nAdditionally, if she has painful enough cramps to need to miss school, I strongly advise you to encourage him to take her to a doctor. Cramps are supposed to be uncomfortable and mildly painful, but extreme pain is often a sign of more severe medical situations than standard PMS cramps.

He is happy to have his girlfriend save him the inconvenience of having to juggle his parenting responsibilities around his paid work, but won\u2019t give her authority to make decisions while she is providing free childcare.  Girl, dump this user.", "NTA he didn't understand because he has no uterus", "NTA.  My mother made me go to school doubled over throwing up from menstrual cramps.  Thank you for being a good person to her.", "NTA. Cramps HURT", "NTA.  If she'd fallen and broken a bone, and he didn't see your message or didn't answer your call, are you just supposed to let lie there and suffer?  \n\nYour bf is an idiot.  Firstly, his no fever rule is ridiculous. A person can be seriously sick and not spike a fever unril much later, or in some cases, not at all. Secondly, he has no clue what menstrual cramps feel like, or what it's like to be female, so he should stfu and trust your jydgement. Thirdly, if he doesn't think you have a right to make such decisions, tell him to keep his controlling ass home til the kids are off to school, and if one of the kids needs to come home because he sent them sick, make sure *he* has to take off work to go get them, because, you know, you can't make a parental decision like signing them out of school.", "NTA", "When I get my period I can\u2019t take midol or ibuprofen cuz it counter reacts on me and makes me sleepy, so sometimes I have to suffer through the pain. Also NTA.", "If she\u2019s having severe cramps maybe she should see a doctor.", "NTA\nIf he doesn\u2019t want you making any parenting decisions, he should hire a nanny to get them ready for school. You have been together for YEARS, it sounds like you live together and are clearly a part of his children\u2019s lives\u2026.does he want his children to view you as a trusted authority figure at all? (And I don\u2019t mean authority figure for disciplinary purposes necessarily, just as like a trusted adult)\n\nAnd I agree with everyone else that says he has no uterus and therefore cannot possibly fathom what period cramps feel like and how painful they can be.", "I really like your husbands response in the end, sounds like he\u2019s at least self aware (:", "Love this idea and you can get one for $20 and it would probably be worth every penny to see hide face when you dial even to 3 or 4.\n\nAlso, i had covid twice, was sick as a dog, contagious, etc - and BOTH times I never got a fever. Judging how sick someone is, or how much pain they have, only by if they have a fever, is total crap.", "I was thinking of suggesting something similar, but was afraid it would break the rules", "Kid's well-being> his weird rule", "On maximum", "It would be cheaper to kikk him in the nutz", "And for those of the Friends age.... \"No uterus, no opinion!\".", "Yeah bam hammer will come upon my nonexistent balls", "I think halfway through will do the trick with these kind of people. They don\u2019t know what it is until they have lived through it. It can hurt like hell.", "I\u2019m honestly curious how bad maximum is. I will either feel very lucky to only have the cramps I have, or I will learn that I\u2019ve been functioning for over two decades of periods with pain that would knock a guy over.", "The girl is 16 and almost an adult. She should be allowed to make some healthcare decisions for herself too. He sounds uneducated and sexist and controlling.", "Definitely. When I was younger the pain was so bad it made me throw up and once I passed out. (I have been checked out, internal ultrasounds, all sorts of scans and nothing was found, the nurse did mention I had beautiful ovaries though\u2026) \nAs I got older they got easier but I still have one day where I cannot get out of bed, need heavy duty painkillers and a hot water bottle.", "I\u2019ve been in pain all my life but I\u2019m better suited to dealing with it then most. I\u2019m on SSDI now- I\u2019ve gotten to spend much more time with my kids and their friends than I would ever have imagined.\nBut probably most important is I\u2019ve always been believed (except one doctor when I was a kid), my family have always trusted my pain was real, my bosses, even SSDI was approved on the first try. \nI hate when people minimize others pain.", "Cool. Still 100% not the place of OP to interject like this.", "That sounds awful. Hate to hear you had to go through that. \n\nI also had some really painful days when I was younger. I noticed it got better when my hormones started to settle down when I got older. I have less pain now then when I was a teenager. \n\nI hope you can take the days off on your worst days. It shouldn\u2019t be a taboo these days to stay in bed or not work or go to school because of cramps.", "That must be the most unusual compliment you've ever received!", "Man the human body can really suck sometimes", "I have had periods like that for years, starting when I was in high school. But they weren\u2019t consistent. I\u2019d be fine for 6-9 months worth of periods and then all of a sudden the bad one would show up. It was like my body saved up all the cramps for one horrible period. Then I would fine for the next 6-9 periods. We never figured it out. There was no reason for it.", "Thank you! It was awful sometimes. Once my period started at friend\u2019s house and the pain came on quick. Two of my friends had to literally carry me home. \n\nLuckily I work for myself from home, so I can set myself up in bed with my laptop and things I need to get some work done.", "Aren't bodies weird? Mine did the opposite - I didn't have much pain as a teenager, but in my 30s the first and second day absolutely floor me.", "It was! I said erm thanks? In response, my mum was with me at the time and burst out laughing.", "Oh honey NTA.\n\nI can relate.  I had massive cramps as a teenager, but I could function.  My little sister, however, was bedridden every month.  We tried everything.  I was popping so much Tylenol, I can't believe I still have a liver.  The gynecologists (unfortunately mostly male back then in the 70s) were dismissive and thought it was GI related and told us to take mineral oil.  We finally found a female gyn who prescribed birth control pills -- which worked like a miracle.  I took those damn things from when I was 16 until after I got married at 27.  (Every time I hear the debates about contraceptives I want to punch somebody -- they DO have other uses.)\n\nTell your bf to get his daughter to a female gynecologist, someone who understands and won't dismiss her complaint", "Btw your bf is actually an idiot", "NTA\n\nTell him he can't understand because he doesn't have a uterus next time he pulls the \"you can't understand\" crap", "The misandry in these comments is severe, yet unsurprising. But still, big NTA. Prioritising a kid's health over school attentance is the moral choice and midol is overrated", "Fair point.  He doesn't know because he doesn't have a vagina, though, either.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI would leave him. This is exactly why I won\u2019t date a man with kids, they always throw the \u201cthey\u2019re my kids, not yours\u201d BS. No thanks, I don\u2019t need that drama in my life.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be treated like an unpaid nanny in your own life.", "NTA. He has never experienced cramps and can\u2019t rally get it. Unless you want to get him a period stimulator and have him try it on maximum. You made a judgement call and as a woman you understood where she was coming from.", "NTA, but if you can\u2019t make parental decisions than he needs to get someone else to parent them when he goes to work in the mornings. Good luck to you.", "He doesn\u2019t understand because he\u2019s never had a period. NTA", "You\u2019re awesome & NTA. I used to have debilitating cramps & my dad never believed it was that bad. My step-mom yelled at him for a good 30 mins about it.", "NTA Dude sounds like a piece of work and not a good dad.", "Why doesn\u2019t he trust your judgment? THATS  the bigger issue imo NTA", "NTA I would often miss 2 or even 3 days do to cramping which effected my ability to walk. Also the pain can be bad enough to cause one to vomit so staying home with really painful cramps is best. If it keeps happening she needs to see a doctor, or maybe see one anyway to explain to dad how pain like that can affect her ability to focus and learn.", "NTA. Bf is misogynistic. Thanks for protecting the child.", "NTA. Make him watch all of the videos on this profile: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CpjCmhkgYPr/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=\n\n\nAnd Make sure she gets to a Gyno that takes her pain seriously.", "NTA. If he doesn't want you making parental decisions, then he shouldn't leave you to parent his three kids. You made the right call. Menstrual cramps can be debilitating and he has no right as someone who has never experienced them to say other wise.", "If he's not okay going with your judgement, he needs to figure out how to be there in the morning. And he sucks for not taking her needs seriously. NTA\n\nEdited spelling error", "NTA. If he doesn't want you to make parental decisions, he shouldn't expect you to take on parental responsibilities.", "HE is the one who doesn\u2019t understand because HE doesn\u2019t have a uterus. His attitude is appalling. \n\nNTA.", "I had hell with this issue of course my dad never had cramps lucky man and my mom never had bad cramps. Mine were and still are crazy bad but they never got it.", "Exactly, NTA that is a woman\u2019s decision for sure. I remember getting my period and still going to school, only to feel the shame and embarrassment of bleeding through my first period class. I was paralyzed when the bell rang because if I got up everyone would see. Luckily the teacher was a total gent, and pretended not to notice me waiting for everyone to leave, and grabbing tissues off his desk to clean up the chair. I called my mom and she picked me up no question was I going back that day. I truly believe women should have the 1st day be a no questions asked day off when needed. A man has no business getting into period talk.", "Even better his balls and stomach, then he\u2019ll have pain in a reproductive organ just like his daughter", "Ooh, I love watching men get hooked up to one of those things, especially misogynists!", "Yes! Please!", "Right! I don't understand how this rule can even exist in the age of covid. The school will literally call us to pick ours up it they have those symptoms, fever or no.", "I had covid and my tempt was 99\u00b0 for like half a day. Lol I never get fevers. I've had walking pneumonia TWICE and had no fever. I always hated this \"no fever you're not sick\" rule. Ludicrous.", "I was trying to word it as to not get deleted. But I like how we think", "You can find videos on YouTube. There\u2019s one where I think it\u2019s a British chat show, two guys one girl, and she puts one on also. She gets to 8 and is like \u201cyeah, this is a bit uncomfortable, but I could still function.\u201d They do go all the way to 10 and says it\u2019s a level of pain where she might think about calling out.\n\nDudes get to 3 and they\u2019re already doubling over.", "I feel your pain. I'm glad some of your pain has eased a bit.\n\nMy menstrual cramps were miserable, too. Ibuprofen was my very best friend until they wrecked my stomach. They were always discounted by my doctors.\n\nI didn't discover that I had 8 fibroids until a week before my hysterectomy.", "ou opted for the child's welfare.", "This is me, I normally don't even feel them and am just fatigued, but then one will come out of nowhere and decide I need to feel like I'm in labor again", "Oooof, I am glad to hear you are able to do so because that sounds so painful. I hope you\u2019ll cut yourself some slack on those days because it would be normal to not work on those days at all. Sending love from me to you!", "Oof sounds so painful. I hope the pain is less now. Sending love from me to you"]}
