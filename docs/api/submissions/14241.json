Beg pardon? Stick a cramps simulator on that jackass and turn it on high. \n\nAnd he can\u2019t have it both ways. If you are going to be responsible for the kids, you also have to have the authority to make judgment calls when it comes to their welfare. If he doesn\u2019t agree, that should be a deal killer because being both responsible and powerless will lead to burnout and resentment.", "NTA, if he doesn't trust you to occasionally make parenting decisions for the children, he shouldn't give you parenting duties for the children. He wants his rules followed in a situation where you can't get ahold of him? He shouldn't have left them with you. There are plenty of medical issues that do not involve getting fevers. Personally, I have multiple chronic illnesses that cause me extreme pain, migraines, etc. and not a single one of those conditions will trigger a fever. If my parents tried to enforce a \"fever only\" policy I would have likely triggered issues with the school from consistent trips to the nurse when I should have been kept home.\n\nI suggest you sit down with him and discuss your role in the children's lives. If he decides that you make may no decisions without his explicit say so or following his very limited and specific rules, then I advise you remove yourself from the morning routine. He can hire a nanny or get his own children ready for school, or he can let you make in the moment decisions about his children's health.\n\nAdditionally, if she has painful enough cramps to need to miss school, I strongly advise you to encourage him to take her to a doctor. Cramps are supposed to be uncomfortable and mildly painful, but extreme pain is often a sign of more severe medical situations than standard PMS cramps.

I feel in a way, this helped my relationship with my mother even more as she had shown she trusted me and I could be open with her. Him not allowing his kids to stay home unless they have a fever is insane. If the kids are especially high achievers, they can get burnt out and need days off. Or situations like this occur, a medical issue. All it is doing is showing to his daughter is that she can't go to him for help, not for medical issues and not for mental issues. You're NTA obviously, I sympathize with the painful cramps as I sometimes get them and just a heads up, cramps really shouldn't super painful all the time everytime. Just in case I would take her to the OB, them medical issues can hide in plain sight.", "Nta and tell him he can be at home to get the kids to school", "NTA . Infact you were more than perfect . Your BF acted hostile and said mean and inappropriate things .", "In an episode of Impractical Jokers, Q\u2019s punishment was experiencing the pain of labour during childbirth by one of those simulation machines. The boyfriend needs to be hooked on one of those but for menstrual cramps.", "NTA\nGet the machine put it on his stomach and turn it up. Ask him to them get up and go to work with the machine on.", "Yup, sounds like he wants to be the one actually doing the day-to-day work of caregiving from now on, congrats on your new open schedule OP!", "What studies?", "Those are TENS units. I use them to RELIEVE cramps. Dudes are hooking at them, crying and screaming - meanwhile they're relieving to use if you have legit cramps. :/", "Google it fam.", "Yeah, I just did, there are no studies.", "NTA Let me say thank you for showing compassion to Seanna. As a teen My cramps were so bad that I would lay on hardcover books trying to ease the pain. Doctor gave me an open script for Darvon. Do they still those pills? The pain faded as I grew older.", "NTA. You did the right thing. Like you said, this was a one time occurrence. \n\nPeriod cramps are no joke. Girl code: I would not wish it upon my greatest enemy. I am so mad at my best friend right now but I wish her period is as painless as possible.", "So he leaves them in your care, but you are not ALLOWED to make decisions about their care?  He\u2019s TA here and he needs to pull his head in", "NTA. But what\u2019s interesting is you\u2019re good enough to get them ready and off to school but not good enough to make a call on cramps. There is something wrong here\u2026", "NTA but stop doing motherly duties on a girlfriend's salary. Let him handle his kids from here on out.", "NTA. Tell him he doesn\u2019t understand cause he has no uterus.", "NTA but your boyfriend is right. He is the parent.\n\nHe needs to step up and parent. This means that if you aren't allowed make decisions you should never be left alone with the child.\n\nSchool drop off and collections: all on him.\n\nIt's upto him to parent.", "NTA!!!!\n\nIf you\u2019re not allowed to make any parental decisions, he shouldn\u2019t expect you to perform any parental duties either! Maybe also reviewing how you divide the bills? Since he\u2019s the father, he should be paying for 4/5 of all the bills and you could buy your own separate food that the kids are not allowed to have. Also your own wifi that he and the kids can\u2019t use. How great is that? lol\n\nI assume you\u2019ve been living together for at least a whole year at this point and in this whole time, his 16yo has ONCE expressed such bad cramps right before class, but he somehow is soooo sure she\u2019s faking it \ud83d\ude44 He has no idea what cramps are like. If he\u2019s gonna raise someone with a uterus, it\u2019d do him wonders to research periods or even go to a gynaecologist and be lectured on them.\n\nYou\u2019re a great ally to his kid, he needs to grow up.", "N he doesn't understand cause he has no uterus. Nta \n\nFor some it can be utterly debilitating!  Even at such a young age. My mum went to school with a girl who would be home 1 week every month.. she'd sometimes even pass out. \n\nShe let me go on the depo shot cause of pain ..\nTell him to try the cramp simulator, then decide lol \n\nNTA", "My mum and I both dealt with passing out while on our periods as teens, fun times lol", "Absolutely love your response \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4d", "That's terrible. I do know some friends with similar experiences re: endometriosis. Severe pain can be a sign of a medical issue for sure, but not always. Some people just get bad cramps. I'm my case, getting on birth control and later having children made my cramps non existent. But I do agree about getting checked. It's good to get into the habit of going to the OB-GYN regularly early, finding a good one, and learning to advocate for yourself early, in case there is a serious issue.", "Such a miserable feeling. Especially when people ask questions but it hurts too much to talk."]}
