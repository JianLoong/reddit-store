I think most of my moms immediate family gets them and honestly, I think a good portion of people that I\u2019ve been close to my whole life do. This is not new for me. When I met my wife (39F) years ago she was pretty worried about getting them from me and was very cautious about not sharing drinks with me, washing my pillow case, and touching me in general when I would have one (or for like a week after it went away). Not a big deal, they suck and I don\u2019t wanna give them to her. She also asked me to ask my doctor about a daily antiviral prescription but honestly I don\u2019t get them bad enough or frequent enough to want to take pills for the rest of my life so I kinda let that be.\n\nI didn\u2019t mind the caution, but I always felt shameful about it given the degree of worry she\u2019d give it. Even her mom would notice when I got one and comment about it and ask my wife if she was afraid of getting them and would ask if I was stressed or sick or if I knew what else might\u2019ve spurred it to come on (cold sores have a lot of triggers and are pretty random, too). They would also always talk about who else they know that get cold sores and how they\u2019re so glad they never got them. I always brushed this off as insensitivity and not necessarily a personal attack.\n\nThen we had kids. Whenever I have a cold sore my wife would literally treat me like I had leprosy. Like even if our kids touched my cheeks or hair she would make me get hand sanitizer and wash their hands. I thought this was pretty over the top. Obviously, I want to keep my kids from getting them, but we literally sleep with our kids. Like I have a child crawling all over me in my sleep, sharing a sheets, pillows, blankets, everything. I can\u2019t possibly prevent every means through which they could contract them.\n\nSo recently, one of our kids showed signs of a cold sore. It wasn\u2019t like huge or blistering, but it definitely looked like a little cluster and I told my wife this so she was aware. And she was furious. Mind you, I hadn\u2019t had a cold sore in months, and now she\u2019s questioning me if I had been touching my cold sore and not washing my hands. Asking if I had been absolutely sure to keep my cups out of reach of the kids (they like to drink other people\u2019s water like it tastes better). Accusing me of myriad other possible crimes against minors. And I got so mad, telling her that I take every precaution but ultimately there was no way that I could possibly know how the kid got a cold sore, if it was from me at all, and if I could\u2019ve even prevented it. She pretty much said that my attitude of \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do\u201d pretty much guaranteed that they\u2019re gonna contract them and I\u2019m being negligent for not caring more. I dismissed this and told her she was being ridiculous.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: a lot of the answers I\u2019m seeing are accusing me of not taking precautions. Like \u201cYTA I don\u2019t kiss my wife when I have one.\u201d Like wtf? Neither do I, of course not. I know the health risks of cold sores. I take every precaution I can but _we sleep with our kids_ and she\u2019s not having me sleep separate to keep this from spreading but still upset that it might.\n\nEdit 2: I know that cold sores is HSV-1.

You\u2019re clearly used to it, but it doesn\u2019t have to be normal for the people around you", "If the side effects are minimal or non serious then yeah you\u2019d still be TA for not doing everything you could to prevent spreading this virus to your kids.", "Yes because you claim you are doing everything you can and it's unavoidable but you are literally being told it is avoidable", "Yes. Yes you are. When your kudscare out of the house do what you want. But you are being a bad parent.", "Yes you\u2019re the AH for not taking the pills especially once you had kids. No question", "Even if you don\u2019t take them preventively, you should 100% be taking them as part of the treatment. And 2x year for cold sores is a lot.", "You think you don\u2019t have it, you probably just haven\u2019t had an outbreak and have a good immune system. You\u2019ve definitely touched a door handle or a visa/debit machine at a store that has been handled by someone in a store.", "You don't take the antivirals because you don't want to take a tablet. So no, you don't do everything you can.", "It doesn\u2019t scare you because you already carry that burden - but do you really want your children to grow up spending their lives being cautious of infecting other people?", "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever tried lysine, but I start popping like 1 an hour when I feel that familiar tingle on my lip. It really cuts down on the size and how long I have a cold sore. It\u2019s an OTC amino acid that your body doesn\u2019t produce.", "But you won't take the anti virals. It's like not wearing a condom. You AREN'T doing all you can do to protect your kids.", "All it could take is one slip up. Which, to my knowledge, could be prevented by taking the appropriate medication.\n\nMay I ask, why do you wish to avoid medicating?", "I suspect its more of a \"it's not what you said but how you said it\" situation. Yes, you're taking precautions but you're coming across as being flippant about it. I don't know if you are or not but it certainly sounds like that's the way your wife is taking it so even if you are taking precautions, it's your attitude about the coldsores she's reacting negatively to. \n\nPerhaps you could just highlight to your wife that you take reasonable precautions (because taking daily meds for the occasional coldsore is not reasonable) and that you do care whether you pass them on but being treated like a leper is making you feel bad and as a response/coping method to that you're being blas\u00e9. \n\nI may be missing the mark entirely but that's my take on things", "Take the antivirals like she asked you to. Just because your family passed around cold sores like candy doesn't mean you should continue the tradition.", "You're not taking medications", "What you\u2019re not doing is you\u2019re not taking medication to reduce the risk of transfer. If you can\u2019t prevent every possible way of spreading it, as you claim, then it is negligent bordering on malicious to not take a medication that will lower the risk of transfer in every \u201cimpossible to prevent\u201d scenario.", "You\u2019re not taking an anti viral.", "I worked in medical and have seen some kids whose faces were all broken out (even in their eyes) from it, and I could never inflict that on anyone.", "Oh, I completely agree he dgaf. But socially, we no longer treat people with communicable diseases like social pariahs. So while I agree he's in the wrong, his wife could have gone about it better..... well, if his story is true. \ud83e\udd14", "Honestly the doc said that the frequency with which I get them doesn\u2019t warrant a daily antiviral. Valtrex(?) but it didn\u2019t stop them and didn\u2019t seem to help all that much.", "I could try this. I take 1 daily and 2 on days I have them", "Doctors are casual about a lot of stuff bcz they are human too. Don't use that to justify being negligent. And yes you are negligent. Your kids aren't tge doctors kids so he doesn't care tgat much. You should. God your constant deflection of resposibility begins to apall me.", "So basically you\u2019re saying that all the people that are not infected just have to suck it up because so many people don\u2019t give a shit about it and don\u2019t care about spreading it? You\u2019re saying that even though there\u2019s medicine to prevent this and keep it from spreading the people who don\u2019t have it just have to suffer the consequences and they\u2019ll get it if they\u2019re unlucky?", "Right, because everyone has it. Even people who don\u2019t.", "Def not. I hate the feeling. Probably why I act so defensive.", "Yeah I take L-lysine daily. It definitely lessens the severity.", "That\u2019s not a good analogy. I\u2019m doing the equivalent of wearing condoms. I think she\u2019s asking me the equivalent of getting a vasectomy when we have sex a few times a year.", "I think you hit the nail on the head. A lot of these comments are like \u201cWHY ARE YOU KISSING YOUR WIFE AND KIDS WITH HERPES.\u201d I don\u2019t\u2026 I stay away and wash my hands and keep my face away and everything. I do everything.\n\nBut I\u2019m in general more of a \u201cIt is what it is\u201d kind of person when it comes to stuff like this. Like yeah, I\u2019m absolutely gonna do everything I can, but if they get it from me then I\u2019ll address it then. Idk I just don\u2019t work about it so much. This is definitely the biggest wedge between us here. I can definitely talk to her about this.", "Yeah and sounds like he is in total denial.  Like there\u2019s just nothing more he can do.", "The majority of the world has it. If you\u2019ve had chickenpox, you have herpes.", "I figured you\u2019d heard of it, since you seem to have lifelong experience with those damn things.\n\nAnd I think NTA. Take precautions like you already are, but there\u2019s no need to take a daily prescription for something that only effects you occasionally. Like 50% of the population has the virus, it\u2019s just dormant in many, and they like to be judgy towards the rest of us.", "You take this daily but you won't take the anti-viral daily? YTA", "Could you explain this analogy? I don't understand. \n\nI would assume an anti-viral would be akin to a condom since they're both preventatives.", "Hey, so I get cold sores fairly often and the best way I have found to deal with them is these patches you can get---they're kind of like pimple patches, but they're clear, so they're not obvious from a distance. They completely cover the sore and they treat it at the same time, and they work really fast. My cold sores used to take at least a week to clear up, and with these patches, they are gone in days. Plus, because the sore is completely covered, it massively reduces your risk of spreading them, and imo it makes it less noticeable, which is a plus because I used to be massively insecure about getting them. They make me feel disgusting, mostly due to other people acting as if anyone who gets them is gross... *looks pointedly at the comments*\n\nObviously I still take all the same precautions (no sharing cups or whatever) but I feel a lot better with the patch on. Would highly recommend them.", "I think your \"it is what it is\" attitude is being interpreted as a lack of remorse rather than just a laid back attitude and that unfortunately will rub a lot of people up the wrong way, including your wife it would seem. Talking it through with her should definitely help", "you just said \u201cit is what it is\u201d about giving your child an incurable infection. that you have admitted to seeing the harsh side effects of. THIS is why your wife is pissed. there is nothing unreasonable about taking a single pill a day. grow up. stop being selfish and put your children\u2019s health first. my mom had cold sores since she was a child. neither my brother or i do. we slept in bed with her, we\u2019re affectionate, the whole nine. but my mom wasn\u2019t a selfish AH. \n\nYTA", "A condom is not 100% effective but very close. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing, washing hands, limiting contact, no sharing. But there\u2019s always the off chance they touch something random that I touched or something like a door handle or table. It\u2019s not 100%.\n\nA vasectomy is like 99.99% effective. That would be like taking the pill. I just wouldn\u2019t get them pretty much anymore (outside of rare occurrences).", "I need to look into these, do you know what they\u2019re called? (The ones you use specifically, otherwise I can look generally). That would be great. Seriously. Might be the best compromise with my wife.\n\n> looks pointedly at the comments\n\n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc seriously\n\nI appreciate you.

I don\u2019t freak out when I have a breakout. I just take precautions. I absolutely don\u2019t want my kids to get this. I make sure to be careful. But I don\u2019t lose sleep over it. You slept in bed with her while she had a breakout? If you happened to roll over and touch her face and somehow transfer it to yourself would you have blamed your mom for being negligent? I don\u2019t understand these answers", "I think I see, but I'm still a bit confused. Unlike the production of sperm in which I could imagine someone may want and therefor cause debate over whether the procedure is needed, what's the reason for saying \"no\" here? I can't imagine that you'd want to get coldsores anymore? Especially if it meant further protecting your wife and children. I would appreciate some further insight.", "Thank you. I hope I've helped", "All medications have side effects. My own doctor said he didn\u2019t think the frequency with which I get them warrants a daily antiviral."]}
