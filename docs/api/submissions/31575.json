Your answer wasn't passive-agressive. Letting the dog's surgery be your brother's birthday present is very reasonable. In fact, it can be his Christmas present as well. And birthday- and Christmas presents for the next couple of years too, unless you are Rockefellers.", "How entitled do you have to be to demand a birthday present though? Is your brother an actual child? Serious question", "You're NTA. Is your brother 10 years old? That's about the outer limit where someone would say *Where's my birthday present!?* and not be the A-H. Especially if you.just dropped a grand on his dog's surgery.", "I have never once expected my siblings to buy me a birthday gift, let alone pay for my dog's surgery. NTA. Your brother is acting entitled.", "Learning his lesson didn\u2019t put that $1000 back into your pocket. You didnt have to pay but did it out of the goodness of your heart. If you hadn\u2019t paid for the surgery would you have given him a gift worth $1000? You did enough, mom didnt like having to explain it to family, too bad.", "I can't believe these comments calling you ta", "NTA. There seem to be a lot of spoiled 12 year Olds in the stories. Not OP, but your brother", "NTA. \n\n1: No one is entitled to gifts. \n\n2: you were kind to help his dog and he should have realised that was a big expense.\n\n3: he can\u2019t even be grown up\nEnough to discuss it you directly? He has to complain to mom and then SHE calls to deal with it? How immature of both of them.", "ESH. \n\nEven if you didn't give him a present on the day of his birthday, why did you not at least show up and congratulate him in person? Seems like the decent thing to do rather than just send a half-arsed text.\n\nYour brother, on the other hand, is entitled. Who would ever call someone up and specifically ask for presents Especially from a person one has already received a lot from previously?", "ESH\n\nCould have saved yourself a lot of drama by telling him at the time that this would be an early birthday present.\n\nNot going to his birthday was whats swayed this from being a NTA situation. Could have gone with a card at least to be there to celebrate his day with him and if anyone asked about the present you could make a casual joke about how you got him earlier in the year with the dog.\n\nInfo: you say your brother asked for 'help' with the dog which implies that there may be repayment? Was their any understanding that you were just loaning him the money?", "YTA, but it's not about the gift -- it's about not going to visit him like you did in previous years. If you visited him and wished him a happy birthday, I'll bet the conversation about a gift would have gone more smoothly.\n\nYou're both adults, right? As adults, birthdays aren't about the gifts but the gestures. Maybe you could have brought him something small, like a piece of cake.", "INFO: Why does no gift mean not turning up either?", "NTA for not getting him a present but you could've done it in a more drama free way and without catching everybody's attention, your delivery makes you an AH too, but that wasn't your question, was it now.", "ESH - I would have gotten a very small gift and visited. OTOH Bro should have not expected anything after the dog surgery.", "YTA not for not getting him a gift but for acting so passive aggressive. It was still his birthday you could have at least been nice about it.", "YTA. You should have mentioned to your brother earlier that saving his dog was your early bday present to him. Or you could have bought him cheaper things, maybe a food item or a hand-made gift, or just show up to wish him in person.", "Unless you specified it was his birthday present YTA\n\nYou could have given him something however small", "Esh  you should have said hey this is a lot so consider it a years worth of gifts ok?", "YTA. Unless you said, \"I'll give you money for your dog. Consider it an early birthday present,\" not giving him a birthday gift was a crappy thing to do. What does helping someone with a sick dog have to do with giving them a birthday present? They are two separate things. You even said you helped with the dog for your own benefit as well. This was an AH move on your part.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
