{"id": 3302, "submission_id": "z5enk6", "title": "AITA for refusing to watch my sister's kids after I said I would?", "selftext": "Repost because original was deleted.\n\nMy (F36) sister Janet (F32) has 3 kids: Maddie (F14), Noah (M10), and Nikki (F8). Janet had Maddie with her boyfriend, Mark. They hadn't been together long, but when Janet found out she was pregnant, they eloped.\n\nFor the first several years, their marriage was fine. However, it started getting rocky when Nikki was born because Janet became a SAHM, making Mark work more. It grew progressively more tense between them, to a point where they contemplated divorce.\n\nBecause of Nikki's age, Janet and Mark didn't want to divorce, and decided on counseling. They've been in it for a few years now, and their marriage has gotten better. Their counselor suggested a date every two weeks, so Janet will contact me asking she can drop her kids off at my place. They're well-behaved, so I have no problem watching them; typically, it will be after my work day is over.\n\nThis is where it's messy. Janet asked me if I could watch her kids for a whole week. Her 15th wedding anniversary with Mark is coming up, and they were planning a Florida trip. I only live 20 minutes away, so I was a convenient choice.\n\nI'm a graphic designer and currently working on a large project for a client's baby shower, but I figured that it would still be okay to watch Janet's kids because they'll be in school most of the day, so I agreed.\n\nLater on, Janet then asked if she could have their dog over, too. I said \"no\" because I'm highly allergic, have no space for a dog in addition to her 3 kids, and my husband and I both work full time, so we just can't occupy a dog. Janet seemed understanding, and told me she would look into kennels for her dog that week.\n\nThe day of their trip, they came over, and Janet handed me a leash with their dog, and gave my husband a bag of dog food. I pulled Janet aside, mentioning that I had explicitly said my husband and I were in no position to take care of a dog, and she shrugged it off, telling me that Noah was getting separation anxiety from their dog, so they ended up not looking into kennels. She then told me that her trip was important and she saw no reason why I couldn't \"put up with my allergies and put time aside for a dog when it's only one week\".\n\nI reminded her that I was already taking on her children without getting paid, and now she was forcing the one thing upon me that I said I could not do. Janet rolled her eyes and then turned to leave, because they were going to miss their flight and had nowhere else to take the dog. I shoved the leash back in her hand and told her she could forget about her trip, then, because if she couldn't hold up her end of the bargain, I wouldn't either, so there was no need for her children to stay since she had to stay behind for the dog anyway. \n\nLong story short, she missed her flight, called me a huge asshole, and said I'm causing damage to her marriage because \"family would have helped out\". Her friends contacted me, also calling me an asshole.
