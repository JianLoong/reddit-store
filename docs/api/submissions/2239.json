We don't live together and I usually sleep at his place when we spend the night together as I have a roommate and I like to have more privacy. \n\nI recently bought a non-stick cookware kit from a good, expensive brand. I like to cook, so having good quality pans has always been a dream and I managed to get myself as a birthday present 2\n2 weeks ago. \n\nMy roommate travelled the weekend and I invited Ayden to stay at home these days. He came on Friday and the next day I was going to work until 13, so I said that if he needed to eat something, he could, but that the new pans (I showed what they were) should be used carefully, not using a knife or fork. There were other pans to be used and these new ones were different from the others (red and black). I had bought it the week before and had only used it 3x. \n\n\nThe weekend went smoothly, he waited for me for lunch and we went out to eat for lunch and dinner. \n\nOn Sunday, he woke me up with breakfast in bed. All ok, when we went to take the dishes to the kitchen, I saw the new frying pan in the sink. While I was doing the dishes, I picked up the pan and it had some scratches on it.\n\n I asked him if he had used a metal knife or fork on it and he made a face of despair, apologizing a thousand times, saying he had forgotten and ended up using a metal fork. \n\nI put it aside so as not to spoil the day, but I was angry. \n\nHe left on Monday and Wednesday, I sent a screenshot of the cheapest price  found for the frying pan (same brand and still expensive) with the following \"Hey, I found it on this site for this price, I thank you for the breakfast intention and that It wasn't intentional, but you used something I said to be careful and ended up damaging something special for me. I want you to buy a new one\"\n\n He started to say that it was too expensive and that some scratches was no reason to buy a brand new pan and that I was overreacting. Basically refusing to pay for a new one and calling me an asshole for demanding that I pay for it, being that it was only a few scratches, he even questioned if he did it himself, as it could have been my roommate (it wasn't, she never used these pans). \n\nI don't know if I'm wrong here, but it's disheartening to see my new birthday present damaged, given that I've always been careful and I asked him to be too. Added: I forgot to put before in the text, but I even suggested he get mine for him, if he wanted\n\nAITA?\n\nNot a native english speaker, Sorry for this.\nFor Brazilians, It was a Polishop frying pan.", "created_utc": 1668347867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu2ee0/aita_for_sending_the_cost_of_my_frying_pan_to_my/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Mistakes are like that sometimes. You screw up, pay the price, and learn a lesson. He needs to buy a new pan and apologize, or get dumped.

A single scratch on a nonstick surface releases over 9,600 particles of microplastic into your food, and that new flaw in the coating allows more carcinogenic PFOA/PFAS/Teflon to leach into your food while cooking.

You don't get to dodge the consequences of your actions just because it was made with \"pure intentions\". Pay for it, stop arguing/deflecting to her roommate after admitting you did it, and move forward. Him avoiding the blame and the consequence is a pretty obvious red flag on top of the fact that he can't listen worth shit. Come on now. You clearly don't think for the long-term. \n\nIf it was an honest mistake, he should pay for the pan and just use different ones (as he was offered to do so previously). He made the choice to use a pan she specified was important, fucked it up, and now won't make it right. If this is how he reacts in a small situation, imagine a bigger one?????? Very clear red flags. \n\nShe's seeing his faults \"early on\" and asking him to take responsibility + replace it. Which is a reasonable ask.
