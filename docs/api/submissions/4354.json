My step-grandmother ended up telling her son about them and insinuated that he could have one. He ended up texting my mom about it and he was asking if he could have one. My mom didn't want him to have one because of his past treatment of animals. He used to have a dog that he shot in the head because he had bitten 2 people and didn't want to have to bring the dog to a rescue. My mom stated around telling him no... she said that she'd let him know, but it would be unlikely because there was already a long list of people who wanted one. \n\nWell, fast forward to when they were born... my mom texted him and told him he couldn't have one, and he was SO rude to her through text. He then got my step-grandmother involved, and she ended up calling me instead of my mom (she's afraid of confrontation with my mother... they've never gotten along well). She ended up telling me that my mom was in the wrong for not offering a cat to her family and that he had already ended up promising his teenage stepdaughter that she could have a cat. My response was that it wasn't my business, it was between him and my mom. I also ended up saying that he shot a dog in the head... so why would my mom even want to give him another animal? And then I also ended up saying that him prematurely promising a kid a pet was a personal problem and not our problem and if he really wanted a cat for her, then he should rescue one from a pound. This escalated, and now he's blocked me and my mom on social media and it's caused the family to split (we have a lot of family issues... this was just the straw that broke the camel's back).", "created_utc": 1670623604, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zha7wv/aita_for_telling_my_grandmother_that_my_uncle/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That means they were afraid she would speak her mind more eloquently than you did, and they were hoping they could use you to sway your mom's opinion.\n\nGood on you OP for backing your mom up.

I even agree with the method. It's quick, so no suffering.

And some folks feel a responsibility to take care of it. In the sense that, its a horrible thing for it to have to be done, so my punishment for letting it get this far is I have to do it myself.

Most dog attacks are human errors. Period. If you throw stones, harass an animal, you deserve a good bite. We hold animals up to standards we don\u2019t for humans. That\u2019s bs.

The city I live in currently is strict. 1 report is a fine. And 2 reports is a fine, and euthanize.\n\nThe place I lived in before though was pretty lenient.
