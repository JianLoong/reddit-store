Also, the response \u201che didn\u2019t cheat on me\u201d is plain insensitive. It\u2019s also odd to blame her for the divorce. Yeah, they could\u2019ve possibly moved past it, but why is that the responsibility of the person that was cheated on? Also, you willingly let your dad use you as a tactic to manipulate your mom into forgiving him after her had an affair is just gross.

Of course Mom is going through a deeply awful, traumatic thing, Dad is an AH of rare form, but it is parents\u2019 job to come up with custody schedules, contact schedules, and reach out to their kids precisely because that is a responsibility that kids can\u2019t appropriately and should not have to take on. Mom is not at a hospital, or emotionally or medically unable to talk to her child (or if she is that has not been properly explained to her child), she is at her child\u2019s Grandmothers house and has not called, made a visit, taken her out for lunch, asked her how school was, or even asked her over to her Grandmas house for the weekend for three months because she is mad the kid chose to stay in her hometown???? She only reached out because she found out a stranger is living with her kid now, and she blames the kid and not the Dad or the stranger? \n    \nThis makes me wonder if the Mom either has not historically been a connected parent, or if the trauma of these events have compromised her ability to parent in a way that has not fully been explained to the kid, but explains why Dad got to keep the house and has had full custody. The kid of course can and should learn to have more empathy for the Mom\u2019s painful situation, but the very odd facts shared here suggest there are many many more layers to this, and it is ultimately just never the kids job to parent the parent, no matter what the parent is going through.", "She didn\u2019t get pregnant but this is what happened with me.
