Also, the response \u201che didn\u2019t cheat on me\u201d is plain insensitive. It\u2019s also odd to blame her for the divorce. Yeah, they could\u2019ve possibly moved past it, but why is that the responsibility of the person that was cheated on? Also, you willingly let your dad use you as a tactic to manipulate your mom into forgiving him after her had an affair is just gross.
