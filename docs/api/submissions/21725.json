This party is the for the whole family and people that didn't make the wedding cut, so they can celebrate with the bride in some form. They will buy everything. I said \"Where do the people live that are not invited?\" She didn't respond. But I said sure even though we have the same size community space.

It is however inappropriate for you to expect the 21 and down to deep clean the house, patio, set up tables, chairs, linen, decor and DJ for an event they are not invited to...The problem is you knew they weren't invited and was never going to say anything unless I asked. So they basically are giving themselves a party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe responded with \"They can come to engagement party just not wedding they didn't make the rule they are trying to include everyone by having this party.\" I said, \"That is a great idea, but we don't want to throw our own not invited party.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, she adds \"She is not mad the venue holds 120 people the invite list is at 150 they have to cut 30 people.

It's very poor taste to ask people to host a party and ask them to DJ knowing that they won't be invited to the actual wedding.\n\nI can't imagine ever going to an engagement party knowing that I wouldn't be invited to the wedding!\n\nIt sounds like the bride/groom are trying to get a free party for their engagement- it's very tacky on their behalf!", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your relatives wanted you to host because they want less work/cost for themselves.  Also, if they've sent out Save the Dates and are now cutting the guest list by 30 people, there's a high possibility that you aren't getting an invitation to the wedding.\n\nThey can host this party themselves.", "NTA.  All take and no give, seems like they are using you.", "NTA. It\u2019s really tacky and classless for her to be asking this. If anyone asks, I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to clarify why you didn\u2019t want to host.", "NTA. Your place, you decide the whatevers, for whatever reason, ie the detailed  explanations do not matter. \n\nActually, if you hadn't explained, the issues probably wouldn't have surfaced, meaning, that's a sign they knew they're using you, ie wanted to manipulate you to meeting their expectations so your explanations get picked apart as if you're the problem. Ask if they'll do a through pre-clean and set-up and then clean-up after and pay a bond (signed agreement that it's for cleaning and damages). Agreements between friends and relatives actually show trust and avoid misunderstandings. \n\nWhy couldn't they put up a marquee in their own backyard? Or hire an affordable hall? Using you and your place saves them work and money. And kids U21 get to wreck your place, not theirs.\n\nBTW I've never heard of anyone holding a wedding rejects party. It's weird - come to celebrate the marriage but no wedding. Perhaps they show a video of the bride, lol! Or does she just want to dress up a 2nd time? Especially doing the wedding rejects party on the cheap at someone else's house. Just throw a big engagement party and leave it at that.", "Nta. Normally I would side on the \u201cyou said yes. You hold your end of the deal.\u201d But that was extremely deceptive and you\u2019re right. They would be throwing their own \u201cyou\u2019re not good enough\u201d party. That\u2019s a slap in the face.", "NTA. They are horrible, greedy gift grabbers. It is the height of rudeness to invite people not invited to the wedding to other wedding-related festivities---including engagement parties, showers, bachelorettes, etc. You are absolutely right to say you can no longer host this mess at your home. You'd be lucky to never hear from them again.", "NTA - they were totally trying to use you. They only decided to send a save the date so they could start asking 'favors' - notice the timing. They can go pay for a place or host in their own space.", "NTA. They are using you.", "NTA it\u2019s weird they would ask that of you.", "Nta. I would be pissed if im hosting a party but most of my family wouldnt be invited. And heres the other thing, sure no kids but 18 and 20 year olds can surely handle themselves at a wedding. I wouldn\u2019t host a party unless they could come.", "I'm no Miss Manners but isn't it rude to send a save the date and not follow through with an actual invitation? NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s incredibly rude to ask someone to host a party for you, but it\u2019s even worse to have an engagement party that includes people who won\u2019t be invited to the wedding. It\u2019s essentially saying, \u201cWe are having a party, and you\u2019re not invited!\u201d I would feel awkward being associated with this party in any way. I would feel especially irritated if someone asked my adult children to help with the party knowing they didn\u2019t \u201cmake the cut.\u201d\n\nIf these people really mattered to the bridal couple, they would have chosen a larger venue. If they want to host these people in some way, they should have a party independent of the wedding festivities. But having an engagement party with people who didn\u2019t make the wedding cut sounds narcissistic.", "Did all of this happen in the span of a single conversation?", "NTA. What kind of people invite people to an engagement party (expecting gifts), but don't invite them to the wedding? That's just not done. I've heard of people doing this with wedding showers too - invited to the shower, but not the wedding so the bride and get gifts to people who were not good enough to make the cut. This is even worse.", "NTA. There is a suckered born every minute.  Don't let that be you. It's a disaster waiting to happen.  At least 30+ guest + bridal party+ immediate family + people going to wedding that the bride just couldn't say no to. + CLOSE FRIENDS. Basically, another reception  on your LABOR AND DIME.  dime. Not catered. \"Help buying food,\" not cooking food\".  Big no way", "That\u2019s bullshit! Your NOT THE ASS! x10", "NTA, also engagement parties are usually to get gifts. They are including people that won't make the wedding cut, but will likely buy them gifts.\n\nClassless, like another poster said, is right.", "NTA.\n\nTell them no. Skip that whole mess. If you go to any of the parties or wedding they are going to make you out to be the bad one. They're just being cheap. You're not close to them so go back to living your life as if they don't exist.", "NTA. And don\u2019t fall for her guilt trip", "Inviting people who may or may not be invited to the wedding? Will their invitation be based on the quality of their engagement gift? \n\nYou said you would host this. You're kind of stuck. YWBTA to back out. But your aunt should pay for people to come set up and clean up so your kids don't have to do it.\n\nBut are YOU even invited to the wedding?", "YTA\n\nPrecisely because of your question title.
