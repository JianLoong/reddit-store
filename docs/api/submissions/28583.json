Curious if you're \"allowed\" to do anything by yourself when you have no visitors in town?", "Of course you can have a private lunch with your sister. NTA.", "NTA\n\nOf course you can have a one on one lunch with your sister. Or anyone for that matter.\n\nIf your GF has a problem with that then that is her problem not yours.\n\nYou don't own each other and you don't have to do everything as a couple.", "The fact that your gf thanks it\u2019s rude for you to even ask if you could have lunch alone with your own sister is what they call a \u201cred flag\u201d about the size of those giant flags they unfurl on an American football field. If your gf feels unwanted or excluded because of one launch with your own family members she needs some serious therapy time. NTA", "I hate people like that. They ruin families.", "NTA.  I'm sure there are many other red flags that you are either not seeing or choose not to see.  This was your sister, not an old girlfriend.", "Nta. I had an ex like this about 10 years ago. Always wanted to spend with me and didn't like that I wanted alone time with friends . Walking red flag. Please go have lunch with your sister sans gf", "No that request is not by any means out of line. Your girlfriend is over- reacting and acting childish. Your sister probably wants to talk about family and you both have the right to do so by yourselves.", "Your gf is jealous of your sister as though she sees your sister as actual competition. Ew, and total NTA. Gf is, though.", "I'd normally think OP is not the asshole in general in this situation, but I feel like there is missing information here. \n\nDoes the gf and the sister not get along? Why does she feel it is disrespectful and unfair? Does she have a different family lunch plan in mind? Is there some different family dynamic she is used to? Why is it normal for OP to ask permission to do this?\n\nHow has she communicated this to the friend and family member? Because it probably is communicated with different context for these other people to agree with her.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't get to decide if you are 'allowed' to have dinner with your sister of all people. Do you bro. She should never even make a debate of it, you have every right to spend as much time as you need & want with your family. Definitely NTA, don't let her dictate your life in any way", "NTA. I love hanging out with friends and family, but I often like hanging out with just one friend or family member because the dynamic is so much different when you aren't dealing with other people at the same time.", "What exactly is your girlfriend afraid of?  This is beyond being an unacceptable request, it borders on controlling.   I hope you and your sister have a lovely lunch together and after she leaves, sit you girlfriend down and ask her exactly what her problem is and why she felt it was necessary to not only object, but gather her flying monkeys to back her up.  There's something here she isn't discussing with you, and you need to find out what it is.  NTA", "Absolutely NTA. It\u2019s not like your sister requested your girlfriend have nothing to do with you this entire trip. Maybe your sister wants to discuss something personal with you that she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable divulging in front of your girlfriend especially since they\u2019re still getting to know each other.", "It's reasonable and your sister might wanna talk stuff in private with you.   \nI hope you did it anyway", "Ooof, sounds like you have a stage 5 Clingy Girlfriend. She needs to learn that people in a relationship are two individuals and that couples that are able to enjoy time apart are far more healthier than those who must do everything together.\n\nShe'd just be bored, anyway, as no doubt you and your sister would be talking about events, people and places she doesn't know. How's your girlfriend with boredom and not being the center of attention? Or at least the focus of yours? \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Every couple of months, my husband and his nephew go to lunch and hang out for a while. In no way do I want to interfere with that. I tell them to have fun and enjoy their food. My sister in law and her husband just moved back to our area. My husband goes and visits with his sister after work. Go, enjoy yourself, you don't need to ask me. She's your blood.", "If lunch with your sister is this type of deal you need to run my dude get out now", "NTA.  Easy one.", "NTA. That response from her really is quite odd. It's the opposite with my husband and I - he'll say 'Oh since I'm close to so and so place, I was going to ask *sister* if she wants to catch up for lunch. Want to come too?'. Often my response will be 'Yeah happy to, unless you guys want to have a sibling only catch up? All good either way, let me know'\n\nThe only logical reason in my head is she's worried your sister will talk about her, which begs the question how has she been acting and behaving while they've been staying with you?...", "NTA. It is a red flag that your gf seems jealous of you spending time with your sister. That is silly.", "NTA and your gf is weird.", "Ex-Girlfriend vibes.", "I am a insecure and jealous person\n\nAnd even I don't understand this..\n\nIt is literally your sister, like what does she think is going to happen??\n\nIs she like this as well if you were to go to lunch with your dad, brother, uncle or any other male family member?\n\nIdk i find this very weird. Like she's trying to control you and keep you all to herself\n\nKeep an eye on it op", "Nta ,Bad enough throwing a shit fit over u having a little time with ur sister,  but running to blab to friends/family ur business is the bi red flag. Dump her. More fights to come.", "NTA - this isn\u2019t a question you need to ask. That\u2019s controlling behavior on her part.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is a controlling psycho.", "NTA - your sister may want to have a private convo with you. My husband would never stop me having a \u2018siblings only\u2019 lunch/dinner", "I think your gf's response is disrespectful.  it's like she doesn't seem to understand that this is your family and she is in no way entitled to get between you spending time with your sister.  I think your gf needs a lesson in respect and what's fair and not fair.", "NTA! She's not a baby in a hot car she can handle a few hours by herself.. NTA", "So nta that i think itis really odd that your gf is upset unless there is some hugly inappropriate relationship  with your sister your gf is the one needing  to think about therapy", "Na, NTA... your girlfriend is way out of line for her attitude, you don't need her consent to see your family. Go, be merry and give some serious co siderstion as to whether you want her toxicity in your life.", "NTA that\u2019s such a red flag. For context: I love when my partner spends time with his family, even without me. He values those relationships so much and I love seeing him happy", "NTA you don't need to ask permission.", "NTA. It is completely reasonable to want to have a private meal with a family member (or friend) without anyone else there. Sometimes you have memories to discuss that newer people on your life just wouldn't get. Also, it's healthy to do some things without your partner. Your girlfriend sounds insecure and clingy.", "Your gf is the asshole, not you. Looks like she want to control your time and contacts, and that's totally abusive shit", "Why ask? lol...just tell her your going to have lunch with your sister. End of story", "NTA OP.  Your gf sounds like she might have some jealousy issues.", "NTA And just a heads up, this is a RED FLAG\nAnd you're a grown man. You're allowed one on one time with your family.  If it was a friend different story.  Your GF is insecure, she has nothing to worry about its family, you shouldn't have to ask for permission to go anywhere with your family, unless your all travelling somewhere  that involves you being away more than 1 day.\n\nYour sister may even tell you this.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA. Your girlfriend can see you any day she likes. Time with just your sister is going to be super precious.", "NTA your girlfriend is unreasonable.", "No.  You are siblings.  You are not the asshole to want to spend sibling time with a sibling you haven't seen for 5 years.", "Some people have a habit of making things about themselves. OP wanted lunch with his sister, gf decided that what he really meant was 'I want lunch without *you*'", "From the sounds of it, he wants an hour away from her and I don't blame him. She sounds controlling and the sister probably can't be herself around the gf.\n\nWhy is everyone pretending that he wants to be around his gf 24/7?", "I thought the same thing. Something is missing here.", "INFO: what is the sister's partner going to do when OP and sister are out for lunch? Is OP's girlfriend expected to entertain the sister's partner by herself?", "This is so me!!", "That's how abusive people work. Are you sure he doesn't want to get out of that situation? Have you talked to him privately somehow?", "Well, us the gf expected to keep the sisters partner company? Cause it makes sense to me to be uncomfortable entertaining a stranger.", "She may be trying to isolate you from your family.\n\nThe fact that she isn't allowing you to spend time with family is extremely alarming and enough for anyone to get away from that relationship.", "I\u2019ve been married 25 years. At no point would this have been an issue for either of us. Not even while dating.\n\nEach person in a healthy relationship must have a life of their own, on some level, outside the relationship. Or it will be like this forever. \n\nNTA", "Dude run", "I am a really fucking clingy person and even I think it\u2019s really weird for me to hang out with my boyfriend and his friends/siblings/coworkers/etc when it\u2019s just them and no significant others.", "Then you have way bigger problems than a solo lunch with your sister.\n\nEven if your gf has been cheated on before (which still wouldn't excuse her behaviour) you were going to lunch with your sister does she really think you are going to cheat on her with your sister?\n\nAll couples need their space and you are certainly entitled to have an SO free lunch with your sibling.", "A ton of guys are color blind, especially with the red and green flags", "He probably asked her if he could make this post.", "And we see why they might!", "I suppose they will *now*.", "Which is also true.\n\nHe wants only two people at the lunch and she ain't one of them. I'm sure he didn't have to reject another 10 friends/family, it was specifically her that he doesn't want at lunch.", "They're probably just gonna chill out and read a book or watch TV, y'know, like a normal person.", "Yeah, sounds as if the gf thinks OP and sister are going to discuss her in a negative light.", "Guys, girls, people. Everyone is, jus tguys are a bit worse.", "Absolutely agree 100%. Siblings have an interesting built in bond forever."]}
