He bought the house 100% and then she was irrationally angry towards my mother and myself, then they got married, and now when I call my brother it seems as if I am just talking to him... but NO, I am on speaker phone and I can hear her \"feeding him lines.\"  YUCK.\n\nI am so disgusted with both of them that as sad as it is, I don't bother to call. BTW, he rarely calls or texts me either. I know it's just fodder for the wife-cannon.  She has even started to identify in social media as \"*last-name* Master.\"  She's since quit her job (10-15 years before retirement age and is just living on their little piece of property). \n\nMy brother loves this woman and is letting her run all over him.

I offered to leave or proposed that they get lunch, dinner, whatever. They were fine at the house. \n\nI made the same offer for any friend he wanted to hang out with, I was 100% able to entertain myself in his hometown/house.

This is not at all unreasonable a request.  For our family and the families of their respective  SO's, it is the norm that we have Mom/son, father/son, Mom/daughters, father daughters, etc, etc., activities .

I mean if your sister were always trying to push your gf out and treating her like she didn't belong, then that's not cool.\nBut this sounds like something I do, with MY sister's and mom. My mom and I want to go hang out by ourselves once in awhile just to have girl time or vent or just get out of our houses, does my husband cry everytime? No. In fact, he enjoys time by himself too lol. He usually takes the kids fishing while my mom and I hang out. So again, NTA imo.", "Nta. You need to make her an ex.

NTA definitely", "NTA, my boyfriend is always understanding about me wanting alone time to just chill with my brothers and rarely asks to attend. Your girlfriend obviously has some serious insecurities and trust issues. You should be able to have sibling alone time without her feeling \"disrespected\". It's not even disrespectful?????", "NTA. Your girlfriend is being ridiculous.", "NTA. What is wrong with your girlfriend? I just had lunch with my brother. His wife had other things to do.", "Not at all ! \nIts important to have seperate and individual time with close family.  I LOVE my brothers soon to be wife but its also sososososooooooo nice to just have him and me time like we had for his 28 years of life. \n\nThe same way friends want to get together sometimes without their significant others its not slight its just a nice lil.sloce of nostalgia imo", "Nta, that's a red flag that she is jealous and says it's unreasonable.
