I'll see you later tonight.\"\n\nYour gf is not attached to you at the hip.  She will survive.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is the kind of thing an ex-gf does, not a gf.", "NTA\n\nI'm so confused. Why is lunch with your sister disrespectful? Does your girlfriend think your attached at the hip and must be with you every moment? Does she not trust you?", "NTA it's kind of concerning that your GF doesn't want you to have alone time with your sister. It's a ridiculous level of control or clinginess.", "NTA, perfectly reasonable ask. GF seems controlling though.", "NTA it\u2019s perfectly understandable you want some solo sibling time.  It\u2019s not like you are trying to exclude her.  You just want some sibling time.", "NTA\n\nYour gf is being unreasonable and childish. A sibling bond is something you gotta work on or you can lose it. She needs to respect your family time and not be so selfish.", "NTA WTF? You mean your ex gf I suppose?", "NTA. Your girlfriend sounds controlling and annoying. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having a 1:1 catch-up with your family without her being there", "NTA.  My husband frequently does things with his siblings without me.  Your GF is being unreasonable.", "NTA  what is your gf worried about? Totally normal for siblings to spend one on one time together", "NTA. Seriously, unless she's afraid of your sister's guy, this is just weird.", "INFO\n\nWhat on earth is her justification for it being disrespectful and unfair? This seems like such and obvious n t a that it needs further explanation.", "NTA - It's not disrespectful. But I'll guess that your GF is worried that your sister is going to tell you something that doesn't paint your GF as a good person.", "NTA, your girlfriend is an idiot and there is no need for you ask for a permission.", "Man! she is so insecure that she wont let you have one singular dinner alone with your sister??? dude, dump her, get some one who would encourage you to have sibling time and would feel sad for the two of you now that you wont get to spend as much time together.", "NTA and I would bet your sister requested this specifically because your GF has been unbearable the entire time she has been visiting.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to do things on your own, especially if it\u2019s meeting up with or going out with a family member.", "Showing jealousy towards female family members on your side is a really bright red flag. She's not used to sharing you with anyone, let alone other women. Even if they're siblings. This isn't okay behavior. You're not banging your sister and she has nothing to be jelly about. And her going to ask her friends/family about it and bring it to you like that's a gotcha? No.", "NTA,\n\nMy ex was pretty similar. Before getting married, I used to go for a 5k walk every morning. After I got married, my ex didn't want to go on these walks with me, and instead, she wanted to sleep in every day until 9/10 and sometimes later.\n\nMy sister, one day, asked if she could join me. I went for the walk and when I got back, she'd woken up early for once and found out I went for a walk with my sister and not her. She lost it and refused to speak to me for the rest of the day", "INFO - where is your sister's partner going to be? Is your gf expected to entertain them whilst you and your sister are off at lunch?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your GF seems controlling, or insecure. Either or she needs to just let you enjoy time with your sister. You're across a whole ass ocean, for God's sake. It isn't like you excluded her the whole time and ignored your GF, you just asked for a quiet lunch with your sister before she leaves.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Go, spend some time with your sister.  If your gf can't get past it,  then maybe that's a relationship that needs to be reevaluated.", "Definitely not the AH.  Your GF sounds insecure", "Info - are you talking about going out for lunch, or kicking your partner out of your shared living space for some privacy with your sister?  \n\n\nI think it's probably N-T-A either way but it might make a difference.", "You should be able to have a lunch with and without anyone. This is an acceptable request from your family.\n\nYour gf involving others over a simple request is immature. You should be able to do this without it becoming a community chat.\n\nThink about if you want this for the future.", "NTA\n\nIt's your sister. Why is it inappropriate? I could see her getting upset if it was an ex but it's your sister. That should be fine. Why is it inappropriate? It's your sister.", "NTA\nIn healthy relationships people can spend time alone with their own family and friends. Your gf sounds very controlling.", "No. I encourage my spouse to spend alone time with his family every chance he gets. \n\nAnd that becomes my \u201cme\u201d time.

What exactly does she think is going to happen? You can tell her that she has her family member on her side and you have thousands of internet strangers on yours.", "If you have to askew, there is a problem. But let her know that you and sister are going to lunch.", "NTA and red flag city!  That all stems from jealousy and insecurity.", "NTA. Also, red flag alert. Your gf needs to chill. Her trying to stop you from spending time with your sister is disrespectful. She needs to be reminded that she is your gf and not your mother. You don't need permission and should not have to deal with her attitude.", "It would be different if she was not home and had follow to visit family, in this case NTA.", "Wtf? It's just lunch with your sister and yourself. NTA", "I often feel as though she would like to be", "This.  If gf is uncomfortable with sister's boyfriend for some reason that's a logical explanation for gf's attitude.", "Then you have a problem.", "Does she think you have to be together 24-7? Do you ever get alone time? If she doesn't even like you having alone time, I would say it's a problem.", "You had a relationship with your sister/family before you ever met your girlfriend. Ask her if she would be ok never having any alone time with you, because you don't want to disrespect your family. I doubt she'd agree to it (because it's weird)."]}
