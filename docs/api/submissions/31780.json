Once she made the joke . . . anybody might make such a joke . .  but to keep pushing you as if you ARE really responsible for her food is just too weird. Please consider keeping a journal of all her comments and pushes and the way she treats you in regards to this issue. She is very immature and maybe after tracking some of this behavior you should have a quiet talk with your supervisor if the job itself is being compromised.  Otherwise, maybe just totally ignore her when she presses you about the food. Or just remind her that every ADULT is responsible for their own meals.", "Where do you work? I've never seen people act like this in an office environment, and if I did, I'd tell them to \"pound sand.\"", "Go To HR. Or a manager. She is creating a hostile Work Environment. She has made you uncomfortable.  She will soon start talking to others saying how unprofessional and unreasonable you are being towards her. She will start spreading rumors about you. This will escalate. If there is someone there to back up your claims, the better. She wont stop until YOU do something to stop it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Tell your manager. She's a bully. THREE dollars?", "Jfc, where so these people come from?! NTA. The wildness is crazy.", "NTA but make her a gross lunch", "Go to HR. Document her behavior.", "NTA Tell her that you do not have the time to make her lunch & do not want to show favoritism when you are not able to make other co-workers lunch. If this continues go to HR or management.", "NTA. Very weird harassment. But now that she's actively vindictive at work, it's time to make a visit to your friendly HR officer.", "I'd say give it time. She'll get over it and hopefully things will be back to normal.", "NTA - do these people exist? what obligation do you have to make her lunch?", "Just quote her a $ that covers ingredients and your time", "OP is NTA. Report this nasty person to HR!", "I would tell her that work colleagues are not an extension of her parents.", "NTA!  most replies are saying HR, and that is great advice, but if it doesn't work feel free to make her lunch and be sure to add a little extra(nothing illegal), like ghost pepper, or a laxative.", "Report her to your supervisor ***immediately*** and make sure it's a thorough report. There's a very big possibility, given her behavior thus far, that if you talk directly to her about it again, she'll get vindictive and try to get you in trouble or outright fired.

Don't chance it.\n\nNTA", "Make her a lunch ( with Ghost pepper included )  don't think she will ask again ?", "I currently work in an advertising agency, and yea it's the first time I've found myself in such a situation. It's beyond me why she'd thinks it's okay to ask me to cook for her :/", "People need to stop throwing out \u201chostile work environment\u201d for every annoying thing at work. Please google it- it\u2019s a legal term of art meant for very specific situations", "How in the world is that flirting??", "Being obnoxious and entitled isn\u2019t flirting.", "Yeah, that\u2019s not flirting. That\u2019s just being a jerk.", "I did try to engage her on the topic, she simply dismissed with \"not all girls are gifted with such a talent\" \n\nOk bruh", "3 dollars? .  She wouldn't get a sandwich from a service station for that price. \n A couple of pieces of bread with a scrape of butter and a bit of salad and ... well that's it.

I would have been like okay, this is a one time only meal and it'll cost you $100. But seriously, you need to report her. Don't even try to talk to her as she made it clear she won't listen and is retaliating. You need to document this and make sure you use the words \"harassment\" and \"retaliation\" in your statement.", "You need to go to your supervisor before you go to HR.  They need the opportunity to handle it before it is escalated to HR.  Old, retired manager here.  I would have hated to have been blind-sided by HR involvement before I was given an opportunity to handle the issue.

I'm sure you can figure it out like everyone else, if you put in the effort\".\n\nShe sounds like a toxic personality. Entitled, parasitic, engaging in disruptive behaviour when she doesn't get her way. Her time and energy are too valuable to try to do it, but everyone else's is there to be exploited.", "Goodness gracious, report to your supervisor and HR already for a hostile working environment. You have your own rights as an employee do the company, and her non willing to cooperate with you is causing detriment to your work. This is a reportable incident.", "Good luck to you. She sounds weird. But it's a tricky situation.", ">How long ago could you get a lunch for $3?\n\nIn the mid-80's I was given $2/day for lunch. That got me a gas station hot dog and a soda. A couple of times a week, I could spring for a little bag of chips.", "I'm talking about charging a price that would be prohibitive to pay like $50-100 which OP would also be **very** willing to cook for said amount. She already said $3 so I doubt she'd be willing to spend NY union chef scale to buy the meals.", "some workers have clauses in their contracts against disclosing salary, but yea most folks are not under contract.", "I initially thought the \"make me lunch\" was a profoundly bad attempt at flirting with OP. It actually sounds like something a really sexist AH guy might say to a girl.

Think about how much that would cost now.", "Opps your totaly right", "Oh my dear, people get very weird in the workplace when they are feeling insecure/not advancing they way they think they should.  Instead of looking inside and discerning what they are doing wrong they look outside to find other people to blame.  Get used to it.  It happens a lot.  You'll learn to deal with it.  I hope you have a good supervisor because they can absolutely identify and help with these issues.", "You can\u2019t just say \u201chostile work environment\u201d and expect anything to happen.", "While it's definitely unpleasant for everyone around them, it isn't illegal to be an asshole who doesn't work well with others.", "Similar.

I\u2019m dying laughing btw, thanks \ud83d\ude0a", "Throwing around a term as loaded as \"hostile work environment\" is essentially threatening to sue, which is a very bold first move that will certainly get HR to pay attention.
