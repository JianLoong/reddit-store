I've kindly turn her down everytime she brings up about this issue.\n\nLast Monday, she offered to pay me if I make her lunch, for 3 dollars. I told her no again and she was visibly upset. She told me it's not that hard to make her lunch since I'm already cooking for myself every day, single and I am being unsociable and unfriendly by not making her food. \n\nSince then, she has been passive aggressive towards me. As well as not willing to cooperate at work when I hand her new tasks. It has made me feel bad about it and I have no idea how to go about this, should I have just made her lunch just to keep the peace? \n\nThis feels horrible and I don't know how to deal with it :(", "created_utc": 1701018612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184fefy/aita_for_rejecting_my_colleagues_request_to_make/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Will definitely keep that in mind", "The phrase you want for HR is \"creating a hostile work environment.\"  Yes, your coworker is hurting office productivity, but that phrase is one they are trained to take notice of.\n\nDoesn't hurt that it also accurately describes what she's doing."]}
