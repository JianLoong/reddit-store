It would be shortsighted of your ex to think he can just have her do ABA 7 hours away in a place that is strange to her.  Consult with a lawyer and get a court order that your daughter resides with you as she's benefiting greatly from the consistency and relationships with the ABA staff. I'm sure any reasonable judge would see that having her go 7 hours away wouldn't be in her best interest when she has everything set up with you.

If she is tired during the day, they stop and let her go outside to have her own time. She loves to be outside and she loves to swing. She is allowed to do and have anything she wants, within reason.
