My ex (42M) used to live near me and my daughters - (17F, 12F, and 7F). The visitational schedule allowed him to see the girls, although they lived with me. Before the divorce, he was not involved in anything regarding the kids and usually just came home from work and played Xbox or watched tv - part of the reason we aren\u2019t together anymore. He moved 7 hours away in August of 2022 and has been to see the girls three times since moving for just a weekend each time. He doesn\u2019t call or text the girls at all, and didn\u2019t sent them Christmas or birthday presents. \n\nWe are going through a custody battle now as he wants custody of our youngest. She is basically nonverbal, and attends ABA every weekday. It has made a huge difference in understanding autism and how to help when we have communication issues and tantrums. Routine is key to her and she gets upset and aggressive when it\u2019s upset. Missing just a day isn\u2019t recommended, unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary - illness or emergency. She doesn\u2019t do well in the car and hates new places/people she doesn\u2019t know. She gets scared and has an increase in behaviors (hitting herself or others, tantrums/meltdowns, screaming, banging head, and trying to run away). I have talked with her therapists and doctors and they agree that a 7 hour trip isn\u2019t good for her and missing ABA that long could be detrimental to her growing and learning. There\u2019s also the fact it causes regression and extreme behaviors. I feel like I can\u2019t take that chance. \n\nMy ex has suddenly been asking to have her visit him for two weeks where he lives and I\u2019ve explained it all to him, but he says I am \u201calienating\u201d the kids from him. I\u2019ve offered to let him come here and keep her as long as he wants - taking her to ABA daily, but he said no. He has talked to her therapists about it all and said he can have ABA set up for her there. I\u2019ve checked with the therapy, and neither they nor insurance allow ABA in two locations - even if it\u2019s paid out of pocket. I text him a few days ago explaining that and saying that if he didn\u2019t want to be in the same town as me, he could get the girls and take them an hour and a half away for the weekend. He again refused, claiming I don\u2019t care about her and I\u2019m keeping him from her. He said he only wants visitation where he lives. \n\nSide note: My oldest use to have a good relationship with him until she was about 12. She tried to spend time with him after the separation/divorce, but stopped as he constantly told her that she is going to hell because of her beliefs and identity. She can\u2019t talk to him about herself or friends without repercussions. My middle child refuses to see him as she sees how he treats her sister and he\u2019s said some harsh things to her too. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for not letting my autistic daughter visit her dad?", "created_utc": 1694299828, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ejeyn/aita_for_not_allowing_my_autistic_daughter_to/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The father doesn't have her best interest at heart and I would go speak with a lawyer who practices family law.  Sometimes when the non custodial parent sues for custody or access it's to lessen the amount they have to pay in support. It's quite telling that he doesn't have a relationship with the older daughters. They've seen through his BS. It isn't up to children to maintain contact with their other parent. He alienated himself when he moved far away and didn't make the effort to spend time with his children.", "NTA. Visiting him will seriously disrupt your daughter's routine and set her back.

RBT here, so I know exactly how important routine and keeping a good schedule with therapy is. Make sure to keep everything documented for the courts including her progress in therapy.", "Absolutely NTA. So basically your ex is an ahole to your older daughters who want nothing to do with him. So he is focusing on your youngest whom I\u2019m guessing probably won\u2019t be able to reliably communicate whether she wants to be be with him, and probably couldn\u2019t tell you if he\u2019s a dick to her too. Which he probably would be\u2014he doesn\u2019t sound like a nice or patient guy. From another autism mom, there is no way I\u2019d ever let my kid spend any unsupervised time with him if you have any choice in the matter. My son is 9 and we have had amazing ABA therapists working with him since he was 2 and who now accompany him to his school so I hear you there too. Personally, my son at the moment doesn\u2019t have too much a problem changing up his schedule as long as we let him know in advance, loves vacation, and can express himself pretty well verbally\u2026 and there is no way in hell I\u2019d ever let him go visit someone like your husband. The potential for emotional abuse, regression, and behaviors worsening in a setting where your autism kid (or really any kid) feels unsafe is huge. And you would probably never know what all went on because she couldn\u2019t tell you.  Trust your instincts and don\u2019t be afraid to be a mama bear, you don\u2019t owe him anything.", "NTA at all and you\u2019ve gone out of your way for him to see the kids even though he doesn\u2019t deserve it. I hate to say this but could he only want custody of 7F because of the benefits she would give him? Unfortunately people are like that and get to thinking that they\u2019d be better but really they just want money. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this and sending positivity your way.", ">attends ABA every weekday\n\nYeah I'm just here to read the comments on this one.", "I have an amazing lawyer, just waiting for this to be over. Have to wait a month or so more. Been going through this since 2021", "Thanks for your response. It\u2019s hard dealing with her aggression but the ABA she is at is so amazing. They work specifically with her, because no two autistics kids are alike. She has a treatment plan geared towards her and it aids in learning, social skills, listening and communication. Her behaviors have gone way down and she is more patient, but any day she misses or routine change causes issues. She absolutely loves her therapists and I am glad she has them all.", "My thoughts exactly. He can visit her anytime here. I just don\u2019t think disruption of her daily routine is the answer.", "Thanks, I\u2019d give anything for it to be different and for him to have a good relationship with the kids but he makes it difficult. My lawyer thinks he needs psychological help.", "Definitely! I am keeping everything he\u2019s sent and my lawyer has it all. Our hearing has been postponed so much for many things - Covid and his lawyers quit (he\u2019s on his 4th, I believe). I just can\u2019t wait for it to be over and have some kind of agreement. Hoping I get full custody, but if my kids want to see him they can.", "( and obviously, NTA)", "Thanks for the advise. I am on it!", "I know a lot of people think that ABA is bad, and maybe in some instances it could be for some. However, my daughter had truly excelled and done amazing with it. Her ABA facility allows the kids to be themselves and gears the learning and teaching to each individual child. They teach the parents how to de-escalate behaviors and redirect them, how to communicate with their child, and what to do in teaching at home. They have never told me to prevent her from stimming or anything that makes her \u201cher\u201d and I am grateful for that. She is progressing and excelling better than I could have ever expected.", "Your response means a lot and I appreciate it. Thanks.", "He does seem to be money motivated in a lot of issues it I hope not. Who would use their child like that?! \n\nThanks for your positivity!! It\u2019s been stressful for sure.", "Red flags all over this about his insistence on having the youngest child visit. 7 hours away sounds like it's possibly in another state and that sounds like the potential for real problems.\nStay the course. I personally would not let him take her anywhere unless you are legally required to.", "Absolutely. Children benefit from routine. It would be shortsighted of your ex to think he can just have her do ABA 7 hours away in a place that is strange to her.  Consult with a lawyer and get a court order that your daughter resides with you as she's benefiting greatly from the consistency and relationships with the ABA staff. I'm sure any reasonable judge would see that having her go 7 hours away wouldn't be in her best interest when she has everything set up with you. Getting support for children with needs is often a huge battle so the fact he thinks she can just move away from everything she knows shows he is arrogant and ignorant.", "ABA is certainly a godsend for carers. It ruins autistic children\u2019s lives & gives them mental health issues for life, but it does make them easier for carers to control, so I understand why that would be your priority.\n\nObviously you won\u2019t be convinced otherwise so we\u2019ll all just have to hope she\u2019s strong enough to overcome it one day.", "People think it\u2019s easy to take care of others when it\u2019s not. I had gotten paid because I had to take care of my grandmother but I was terrified of waking up and her being hurt or suddenly died while I had to stay overnight. She had dementia and eventually terminal cancer and it was scary. There\u2019s a reason there are professionals and services for this kind of help. Your daughter is so young that these services are 100% necessary for her independence and learning how to navigate social settings. You seem so kind and caring and I\u2019m sure you want the best for your kid even at your wits end but this guy seems sketchy to Al of the sudden be interest in only one of his kids and can\u2019t be bothered to even call."]}
