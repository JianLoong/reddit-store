The point of wills is that you get to leave your stuff to who you want and it's your money and you get to do what you want with it. The time for the family to have issues is when she was alive and the will was drawn up. If she didn't share the will with them, she did not want their input. They should honor her dying wish. If they don't like the will, take it up with her in the afterlife. If she gave it to charity would they also be demanding the charity return it?

Imagine her looking down from heaven and seeing me disrespect her like that.\"\n\nSeriously, Grandma was a grown-up woman and she knew exactly what she was doing.", "NTA. Their grandma made this will the way she wanted and left money to you because she appreciated you and wanted you to have it. So what if other people don't think it's fair. Inheritance isn't about being fair it's about someone dying and choosing who they want to bequest their assets too. The money is legally and morally yours and they are bullying you because they are greedy.", "NTA\n\nThat said, if you intend to marry this woman, expect her family to NEVER get over this. So just be braced for that reality.", "NTA - the family is showing some signs of greed.  It happens at times like this.  At the end of the day, it was the Grandmothers money to do with as she pleased.  The family doesn't have any say in it.  If they push to exiling you then you will know that greed was the factor.", "NTA. The grandmother wanted you to have it enough that she put it in her will. Her money & her wishes. Deaths can bring out the worst in people, especially their greed.", "NTA. It's not the family's money; it was the grandmother's, willed to you. They know this, but they don't like it. Not your issue, but if they make it yours, they'd need to find some kind of legal recourse (which they probably won't do).\n\nThat said, it'll put a dent in your relationship for sure. This is where you need to have a very tough convo with your girlfriend. Her staying neutral is fine, but eventually giving you shit or being disloyal is not. And, rest assured, if you look into marrying her, you're also going to marry the family (ugh). Think hard on how you'd like your future to look.", "NTA.  Pay off your loans.  That was the intent of the gift.  The others are noise makers.  Ignore them.", "NTA and awww. That was such a sweet thing for her to do.\n\nIt's not up to the family how to allocate grandma's assets, it's according to her wishes. They are disrespecting her and you.\n\nThey are also showing some true colors. Take the $, but consider whether you want to be part of this family. They're greedy and manipulative.", "Tell them to go talk to Grandma, it was her decision, and if you can't convince her to change her mind (newsflash:  She's dead and 6 feet under so her decision is final), then you aren't giving the money back.\n\nWhat a bag of greedy dicks that family is.", "NTA\n\nThat family of gold diggers are showing their true colours.   \n\nThe Grandmother wanted you to have the money and it's not as though she gave her entire inheritance to you instead of them.    Even if you did hand it over it sounds as though each of them would only get another 10-15% each so not going to fundamentally change what they receive.  \n\nI feel sorry for your girlfriend too as she must be under huge pressure from them to get you to change your mind.  \n\nThe Grandmother knew what she was doing and has put you years ahead of where you were so don't let their greed tarnish her last wishes.", "If she left it too you, she wanted you to have it.  For you, this is life-changing money!  Keep the money, pay off your debt and succeed in your life.  At some point if you can pay it forward then pay it forward.", "NTA The grandmother left her assets to whom ever SHE wanted to.\n\nWhen there is a final will, the family can contest legally if they want to, but highly unlikely to succeed.\n\nYou do not owe anyone anything.", ">its not fair that I got so much when I wasnt officially part of the family.\n\nWhat's more family than honoring grandma's final wishes?

She did something for you out of the kindness of her heart, something that obviously didn\u2019t get passed down through the generations. Unfortunately death and money really shows the true nature of people. As other people have said, if this relationship moves further along, this may be something that no one forgets.", "NTA. It was grandma's own money to spend as she wants. GF family is being greedy and I wouldn't interact with them further. Hope your GF is more sensible.", "NTA, sounds like you spent time with Grandma, she must have liked what you said about your life and goals. the jealous people that have 60 k to do what they want can pound salt, you will be spending all of yours to get your life back on track and can start saving for stuff you want and retirement.", "She clearly liked and cared about you. Please take it and pay your loans off with a clear conscience.", "It's not their money.. it was the grandmother's and she wanted you to have it. Go pay off your student loans.

More so if the money is from an estate.  If she had tried to gift the money to you before she died, they would still complain.  A will is written up for a reason and it should be honored.
