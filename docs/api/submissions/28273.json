I lent him my phone for \"business purposes.\" However, I recently discovered that he's sending money to his side chicks, staying at hotels, and eating out. This situation troubles me deeply, especially since our electricity was disconnected due to unpaid bills, and we're now borrowing electricity from a relative who lives nearby. Additionally, I had to drop out of college because he couldn't provide for my tuition and allowance. I've been trying to find a job to support myself, but he's still using the phone and becomes angry when I ask to borrow it. I've received job offers recently, but he keeps ignoring the calls I receive... I went to a job interview and he was mad that I got home late and he has no phone to use. \n\nLastly, he always guilts me by saying that if he has a phone he wouldn't even be borrowing mine.\n\nEDIT: \n\nI own the phone, I bought it with my own money.", "created_utc": 1696508500, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170gke8/aita_for_leaving_home_so_i_could_avoid_lending_my/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
