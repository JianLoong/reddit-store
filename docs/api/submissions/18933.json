Annoying types.", "NTA\n\nWasn't the driver just being self deprecating? He probably just meant \"it's good you can speak English because I can't \ud83d\ude05\".

It's not really fair to accuse someone of intending to be racist when they can barely speak the language. What he said and what he meant to say could have been completely different. I've worked with quite a few people who could barely speak English and they can sometimes say something that sounds rude or offensive, but they just worded it badly and meant to say something else.", "NTA who has such a boring life that they search for microaggressions in every little shit. \n\nTell your friend to get a hobby", "I am not in minority in my home country so this comes from place of privilege but I have come to conclusion that sometimes there are uncomfortable situations (related to skin colour, assumed race or ethnicity and so on) where nobody\u2019s behaviour itself is problematic.

It\u2019s important to keep in mind that someone might have been racist (even without meaning it) or it might have been just awkward social interaction.\n\n\nSorry for not explaining it better, but I would like to get feedback on this", "NTA and I gotta say this is the kind of shit that makes people tired of hearing about race issues. All the tiny little micro aggressions that get pointed out make it so everyone feels they need to walk on eggshells all the time.
