Our dad has been with 'Carol' for close to two years & they got married in early November. \n\nCarol hates us. Especially me. She calls me a 'problem child' and is always picking at me, being rude to me. She constantly compares us to her daughters, constantly picks fights and tries to parent my brother & I. She yells & calls us names when we have to go over. If one of her daughters does something to us, like taking our stuff, she just brushes it off and laughs. And our dad just lets it happen. We have no choice but to see him 4 times a month bc of he and our moms court agreement. But we hate it there & we hate Carol. So we didn't go to their wedding, even though dad was super pissed and fought with us about it for two months after we told him we weren't going.\n\nSo we skipped the wedding. Last Sunday he picked us up like usual and drove us to his house. I noticed right away they were in a better mood than they have been lately. Carol was blabbing at us about their honeymoon in Florida. When we got to the house dad announced they had something to show us and for us to go sit in the living room while he got it. Me and my brother went and sat down, but we both had a bad feeling. The girls were nowhere around, which was weird.\n\nCarol came to sit on the other couch and she was just staring at us, looking like she'd won something. And my dad comes in with a Blu-ray disc and puts it into the player, and sits with Carol. And Carol says in this happy-bitchy voice, this is since the two of you missed it. You can see what you missed.\n\nIt started playing and we realized it was a video of their wedding day. A few seconds in, it was edited to a clip of them saying I do and kissing. My brother saw this and started to cry. And I just got so mad. We hate Carol and that's why we didn't go in the first place. She wasn't gonna force us to look at it now. So I grabbed my brother's hand and pulled him up off the couch and said we weren't gonna watch this. Carol sneered and said we had no choice. I told her she'd never be in charge of us no matter how much she wished she was and told my dad we were leaving. I admit I shouted this part. She told me to stop being a little bitch and I shouted back that she's a big FAT bitch who should know better. Rude I know.\n\nShe shouted at my dad are you just gonna let her talk to me like that? And dad just kind of laughed? And said he wasn't dealing with this and went to his room and locked the door. I took my brother to get his stuff on, grabbed my bag and left, with Carol screaming at me most of that time. Idk most of what she was saying, it was too loud and screamy. I started walking with my brother down the side of the road and called mom on my cell to come get us. We walked about ten minutes before she met us on the road.\n\nDad is mad at me, Carol is pissed but idc. Mom is upset only bc she thinks I shouldn't have walked my brother along the road.

She needs to be in control.  Your father is an enabler.  I hope he likes what he has coming to him with being married to Carol.  I would be done with him after what you have been through.  Never to let him back into your life.  If he needs support as he gets older... you walk away if asked.  Carol and his daughters can care for you.\n\nPerhaps you need to document everything that Carol has done to both you and your brother.  Just write the past examples on a document with general dates and document them all explicitly from now on.\n\nIf possible I would get voice or video proof of what she says and does.  This one is more difficult because you don't want Carol to know that you are recording her.  The recording is because you fear for your safety (physical and mental).

Your father is doing what a lot of people do with the new relationship in that he\u2019s letting the other person have their way so he doesn\u2019t lose a second wife. He probably believes he\u2019s safe by not taking a side when he can\u2019t bring himself to disagree with Carol. \n\nIf you can\u2019t avoid going back, then be very careful.

Also, don\u2019t leave anything of value there. I was in your shoes back in the days before the Internet, and she was a very jealous woman who did NOT like the fact that I was the eldest son.  I left her alone for the most part, and I made it clear that any issues she had with me would have to be brought to my father\u2019s attention. Dad had a devil of a time dealing with it because she complained about everything I did. It didn\u2019t help much that I\u2019m Jewish, and my dad and stepmother were raised Catholic. One year we went to Easter Mass, and I offered to stay behind. Dad insisted I had to go with the whole family. As a Jew, I don\u2019t kneel as a part of worship, and I don\u2019t recognize Jesus as the Messiah, but I do recognize being polite and unobtrusive in other people\u2019s houses of worship. So, when they stood, I stood. When they sat down, I sat down. When they knelt, I stayed in my seat. Nearly everyone in the church ignored me, except my stepmother. She whispered angrily at my dad, who told me to do the same as everyone else. I told him no. We went through one more round of me not doing the same as everyone else (I also didn\u2019t get in line for the Eucharist), and my dad told all of us (I had a stepsister and have a half-brother) to get up and leave. \n\nBe unfailingly polite, no matter how hard it is. That doesn\u2019t mean cave in to what she wants or let anyone take advantage of you, but it does mean greeting her politely, saying \u2018please\u2019 and \u2018thank you,\u2019 and things like that. If you clean up after yourself as you go along, you give her less room for complaint. However, once your or your brother\u2019s rights are infringed upon, record it. \n\nI\u2019m truly sorry you\u2019re in this position. I didn\u2019t cause it, but I sympathize with your situation.
