Our dad has been with 'Carol' for close to two years & they got married in early November. \n\nCarol hates us. Especially me. She calls me a 'problem child' and is always picking at me, being rude to me. She constantly compares us to her daughters, constantly picks fights and tries to parent my brother & I. She yells & calls us names when we have to go over. If one of her daughters does something to us, like taking our stuff, she just brushes it off and laughs. And our dad just lets it happen. We have no choice but to see him 4 times a month bc of he and our moms court agreement. But we hate it there & we hate Carol. So we didn't go to their wedding, even though dad was super pissed and fought with us about it for two months after we told him we weren't going.\n\nSo we skipped the wedding. Last Sunday he picked us up like usual and drove us to his house. I noticed right away they were in a better mood than they have been lately. Carol was blabbing at us about their honeymoon in Florida. When we got to the house dad announced they had something to show us and for us to go sit in the living room while he got it. Me and my brother went and sat down, but we both had a bad feeling. The girls were nowhere around, which was weird.\n\nCarol came to sit on the other couch and she was just staring at us, looking like she'd won something. And my dad comes in with a Blu-ray disc and puts it into the player, and sits with Carol. And Carol says in this happy-bitchy voice, this is since the two of you missed it. You can see what you missed.\n\nIt started playing and we realized it was a video of their wedding day. A few seconds in, it was edited to a clip of them saying I do and kissing. My brother saw this and started to cry. And I just got so mad. We hate Carol and that's why we didn't go in the first place. She wasn't gonna force us to look at it now. So I grabbed my brother's hand and pulled him up off the couch and said we weren't gonna watch this. Carol sneered and said we had no choice. I told her she'd never be in charge of us no matter how much she wished she was and told my dad we were leaving. I admit I shouted this part. She told me to stop being a little bitch and I shouted back that she's a big FAT bitch who should know better. Rude I know.\n\nShe shouted at my dad are you just gonna let her talk to me like that? And dad just kind of laughed? And said he wasn't dealing with this and went to his room and locked the door. I took my brother to get his stuff on, grabbed my bag and left, with Carol screaming at me most of that time. Idk most of what she was saying, it was too loud and screamy. I started walking with my brother down the side of the road and called mom on my cell to come get us. We walked about ten minutes before she met us on the road.\n\nDad is mad at me, Carol is pissed but idc. Mom is upset only bc she thinks I shouldn't have walked my brother along the road. If I'm the A it's alright\n\nEdit to add, a commenter here told me I WAS a bad kid who was exaggerating Carol's rudeness so I'll say here to read my comments so you can see the other shit Carol does.", "created_utc": 1670619871, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zh8ox3/aita_for_how_i_responded_to_my_dad_stepmom_trying/", "score": 530, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to be in control.  Your father is an enabler.  I hope he likes what he has coming to him with being married to Carol.  I would be done with him after what you have been through.  Never to let him back into your life.  If he needs support as he gets older... you walk away if asked.  Carol and his daughters can care for you.\n\nPerhaps you need to document everything that Carol has done to both you and your brother.  Just write the past examples on a document with general dates and document them all explicitly from now on.\n\nIf possible I would get voice or video proof of what she says and does.  This one is more difficult because you don't want Carol to know that you are recording her.  The recording is because you fear for your safety (physical and mental).  Then you take this to child protective services. And it may be via a teacher or counsellor at the school.\n\nYour mom may either have her hands tied with the custody stuff or she doesn't want to rock the boat if your dad wants to go full custody.  You may be able to not visit your dad, but your brother is much younger and will likely be forced to especially when you are not there to help protect him.", "NTA", "Your dad is awful for marrying a woman who treats his kids so poorly.

Sorry for your luck!", "NTA, and sweetie, as someone who was once n your shoes, at 14 you can ask your mom to take you before a family law judge and have the visitation agreement amended so that your presence is voluntary, not compelled. If possible, back this up with phone vid clips of Carol's behavior (abuse, really) so that your father won't have a leg to stand on when he objects.\n\nTrust me, this will not affect child support, which is mandated by the courts. Especially if you present compelling evidence of why you no longer want to visit your father.", "Depending where you live you could be able to get your own court advocate. It's someone appointed by the court to fight for your best interests without any parents input. You would need to start collecting evidence. Having to get your mom to pick you up on the side of the road is pretty good evidence, write it all down. Honestly but without emotion, time, and date.

That you fear for yours and your brother's mental and physical well being if you have to continually go there.\n\nMost states will take all of that into consideration.\n\nIf you don't want a relationship with him anymore, then you and your mom can petition the courts to take away all visitation rights.

Why not get your mom to call him and tell him that neither of you want to come over anymore and see what he says. The court order only matters if your parents don't agree. If your dad agrees to let you stop coming over then you don't have to go to court. You might still want to just to cover your bases but the court isn't going to care as long as your parents agree to the change.

Only just a year or two ago did she finally admit that \"she was an abused wife\" to which I said, \"so then can you admit I had an abusive childhood?\" And she said nothing. \n\nIt wasn't anything super obvious, but enough that it has emotionally impacted me for 30+ years", "\u201cShe told me to stop being a little bitch and I shouted back that she's a big FAT bitch who should know better.

I can\u2019t imagine how hard this is for a 14 year old, but some people just aren\u2019t worth the emotional effort that goes into responding.  When she says something hateful try your hardest to not respond, especially if you\u2019re recording it (which you should).  Or respond with \u201cno thank you\u201d or just walk away.

That\u2019s my favorite tactic - nothing pisses off someone more than just ignoring them.  The key is to elevate yourself above her nastiness so it becomes apparent who is the aggressor.  Unless she gets physical, then call the police.  \n\nTo be clear, NOTHING excuses how she treats you or how your dad allows it.
