I was honestly thrilled at the role I played, and wanted to share it with my friends. Emily was the first to respond, and sarcastically said (paraphrasing) \u201cYes, congrats on being a big corporate stooge OP, clearly you are doing the world so much good at your job\u201d. That got me mad. I may not be saving lives as doctors do but I do really care about the work I do. So I bluntly responded \u201cAt least I got the job I wanted, Emily\u201d\n\nShe was furious, and the other two looked stunned. Emily cussed me out and then left the Zoom meeting right then and there. My two other friends told me I was an AH for my comment. They said that, while they agreed that Emily\u2019s remark was uncalled for, my reply was disproportionate given how much she had wanted to be a pediatrician and how upset she was that she hadn\u2019t gotten it.

This may be true depending on a lot of things, but nobody working in the tech industry is working in their role because of \u201cmaking the world a better place\u201d, and if they are then they are deluded. We work our jobs to get our high salaries. Tech workers are highly competent professionals, if they actually wanted to work a job helping people there are dozens of jobs they could get where they actually do help people. We work where we do because we want the money for our families and future. And I think that\u2019s okay, but own it.

The same can be said about 99% of jobs out there, we\u2019d be just as screwed without janitors, lawyers, pretty much any profession that doesn\u2019t fall under the insurance broker/pharmaceutical sales/etc umbrella is contributing a net positive to society. My point is it\u2019s completely asinine and delusional to say \u201cI am working a 250k/year job at Meta because I want to make the world a better place\u201d. It\u2019s just straight up not true that making the world a better place is their top priority. That\u2019s not a bad thing, but it is disingenuous to represent it as your top priority and an even worse thing to compare the impact of your job to someone like an EMT who is making pennies AND is actually helping people. Helping the world isn\u2019t my top priority, my top priority is taking care of my wife and kid so I own that. I don\u2019t judge anybody for wanting to work a high paying tech job, but I do absolutely judge people for virtue signaling", "If yoy're goung ti take credit for all the good tech does are you also taking responsibility fir all the bad things?", "Well if you want to broaden the scope of tech then sure there\u2019s a lot more people were talking about here. The person working in billing at a hospital is not a tech worker, none of the responsibilities you outline for charities would be a tech worker either. The people actually building these tools are the tech workers, and while it is nice to be passionate about the work you are doing, would you be willing to take a pay cut? If your pay got slashed to $19/hr (average EMT pay for my city), would you smile and be happy that your end users will be paying less for the benefit they\u2019re receiving? I think a vast proportion of these people who are \u201cin it for the social good\u201d would be jumping ship immediately, no matter how positive of a service their employer is providing", "So if your employer told you they were cutting your pay 30% because they need the additional budget to lower costs for end users, you would happily accept and continue putting in your best work right?", ">Yeah and she did cross a line and instead of apologizing for saying something really awful she got upset because OP gave her the same treatment back.\n\nThis is why I asked for info, to determine if she crossed a known line. \n\n>I doubt she ever \"made it clear\" to OP that they shouldn't talk about her lost job opportunity...\n\nGo back and read the post.

It was mean spirited and absolutely unnecessary.", "NTA. Why does she get to act shitty, yet you\u2019re not allowed to call her on her shittiness?", "NTA. She came at you, she started a fight for no reason, she got what she deserved. I\u2019m guessing her shining personality has something to do with why she didn\u2019t get into peds. If she can\u2019t resist being cruel to a \u201cfriend\u201d for no reason other than a false sense of superiority, she shouldn\u2019t be allowed around sick kids and parents struggling with one of the hardest things they can as parents. Those are two incredibly vulnerable populations who require a level of bedside manner I doubt she possesses. She had no reason to say anything at all, but she chose to intentionally be cruel to to try to hurt you unprovoked. She\u2019s not a good friend.", "NTA but your friends are assholes. Do they expect you to just sit there and take her insults? Don't apologize. What you said was not uncalled for.

God, she sounds awful.  NTA.\n\nOh, and don\u2019t forget all the fancy lasers and remote surgeries also brought to you by corporate stooges and project managers.", "Good for you for standing up to her!", "I\u2019m going with a soft ESH and some food for thought: while I completely understand and empathize with the desire to take Emily down a peg (cause seriously what an asshole?!) all you ended up doing was weakening your moral position and creating an opportunity for Emily to evade accountability. In some situations telling the blunt truth can be far more devastating than a cutting clap back. In the future, telling her that her behavior is cruel/rude/uncalled for/hurtful and you don\u2019t know what would drive her to speak to a friend that way, will be harder for her to spin and ensure the support of your surrounding community. And furthermore, if your \u2018friends\u2019 still support Emily or try to explain away her shitty behavior that gives you a wealth of invaluable information = that you need better friends.
