This may be true depending on a lot of things, but nobody working in the tech industry is working in their role because of \u201cmaking the world a better place\u201d, and if they are then they are deluded. We work our jobs to get our high salaries. Tech workers are highly competent professionals, if they actually wanted to work a job helping people there are dozens of jobs they could get where they actually do help people.

My point is it\u2019s completely asinine and delusional to say \u201cI am working a 250k/year job at Meta because I want to make the world a better place\u201d. It\u2019s just straight up not true that making the world a better place is their top priority. That\u2019s not a bad thing, but it is disingenuous to represent it as your top priority and an even worse thing to compare the impact of your job to someone like an EMT who is making pennies AND is actually helping people. Helping the world isn\u2019t my top priority, my top priority is taking care of my wife and kid so I own that.

The person working in billing at a hospital is not a tech worker, none of the responsibilities you outline for charities would be a tech worker either. The people actually building these tools are the tech workers, and while it is nice to be passionate about the work you are doing, would you be willing to take a pay cut? If your pay got slashed to $19/hr (average EMT pay for my city), would you smile and be happy that your end users will be paying less for the benefit they\u2019re receiving? I think a vast proportion of these people who are \u201cin it for the social good\u201d would be jumping ship immediately, no matter how positive of a service their employer is providing", "So if your employer told you they were cutting your pay 30% because they need the additional budget to lower costs for end users, you would happily accept and continue putting in your best work right?", ">Yeah and she did cross a line and instead of apologizing for saying something really awful she got upset because OP gave her the same treatment back.\n\nThis is why I asked for info, to determine if she crossed a known line. \n\n>I doubt she ever \"made it clear\" to OP that they shouldn't talk about her lost job opportunity...\n\nGo back and read the post.

She came at you, she started a fight for no reason, she got what she deserved. I\u2019m guessing her shining personality has something to do with why she didn\u2019t get into peds. If she can\u2019t resist being cruel to a \u201cfriend\u201d for no reason other than a false sense of superiority, she shouldn\u2019t be allowed around sick kids and parents struggling with one of the hardest things they can as parents. Those are two incredibly vulnerable populations who require a level of bedside manner I doubt she possesses.

In some situations telling the blunt truth can be far more devastating than a cutting clap back. In the future, telling her that her behavior is cruel/rude/uncalled for/hurtful and you don\u2019t know what would drive her to speak to a friend that way, will be harder for her to spin and ensure the support of your surrounding community.

That's a real asshole attitude.\n\nInstead of calling her out on her bad attitude, you made a mean comment in return.

You felt hurt by what she said, so you decided to hurt her in return.  That's very mean of you. Therefore YTA. \n\nOf particular annoyance in this situation is that now Emily's mean attitude now goes totally unchallenged.
