This may be true depending on a lot of things, but nobody working in the tech industry is working in their role because of \u201cmaking the world a better place\u201d, and if they are then they are deluded. We work our jobs to get our high salaries. Tech workers are highly competent professionals, if they actually wanted to work a job helping people there are dozens of jobs they could get where they actually do help people.

My point is it\u2019s completely asinine and delusional to say \u201cI am working a 250k/year job at Meta because I want to make the world a better place\u201d. It\u2019s just straight up not true that making the world a better place is their top priority. That\u2019s not a bad thing, but it is disingenuous to represent it as your top priority and an even worse thing to compare the impact of your job to someone like an EMT who is making pennies AND is actually helping people. Helping the world isn\u2019t my top priority, my top priority is taking care of my wife and kid so I own that.

The person working in billing at a hospital is not a tech worker, none of the responsibilities you outline for charities would be a tech worker either. The people actually building these tools are the tech workers, and while it is nice to be passionate about the work you are doing, would you be willing to take a pay cut? If your pay got slashed to $19/hr (average EMT pay for my city), would you smile and be happy that your end users will be paying less for the benefit they\u2019re receiving? I think a vast proportion of these people who are \u201cin it for the social good\u201d would be jumping ship immediately, no matter how positive of a service their employer is providing", "So if your employer told you they were cutting your pay 30% because they need the additional budget to lower costs for end users, you would happily accept and continue putting in your best work right?", ">Yeah and she did cross a line and instead of apologizing for saying something really awful she got upset because OP gave her the same treatment back.\n\nThis is why I asked for info, to determine if she crossed a known line. \n\n>I doubt she ever \"made it clear\" to OP that they shouldn't talk about her lost job opportunity...\n\nGo back and read the post.

She came at you, she started a fight for no reason, she got what she deserved. I\u2019m guessing her shining personality has something to do with why she didn\u2019t get into peds. If she can\u2019t resist being cruel to a \u201cfriend\u201d for no reason other than a false sense of superiority, she shouldn\u2019t be allowed around sick kids and parents struggling with one of the hardest things they can as parents. Those are two incredibly vulnerable populations who require a level of bedside manner I doubt she possesses.

In some situations telling the blunt truth can be far more devastating than a cutting clap back. In the future, telling her that her behavior is cruel/rude/uncalled for/hurtful and you don\u2019t know what would drive her to speak to a friend that way, will be harder for her to spin and ensure the support of your surrounding community.

That's a real asshole attitude.\n\nInstead of calling her out on her bad attitude, you made a mean comment in return.

You felt hurt by what she said, so you decided to hurt her in return.  That's very mean of you. Therefore YTA. \n\nOf particular annoyance in this situation is that now Emily's mean attitude now goes totally unchallenged.

Emily, on the other hand, spent years and years focusing on her dream job only to lose it, not because she wasn't good enough but because there wasn't a position for her.

If they talked to her and also told her she was out of line to say what she said, they are absolved of suckage. \n\nOverall, it sounds like all of you need a new conversation and clear the air. Communication is important. I hope you are all mature enough to move through this mess together. Also, if Emily is unaware she has the mean streak issue, you all should be better friends and help her fix it.", "NTA, and I'd also like to point out, that you get extra bonus for a quick thinking and witty response! I envy you. I usually get so stunned in similar situations & all comebacks I should've said come to me few days later...  \n\n\nyou were attacked and you defended yourself.

Eat on that for a minute, why don't you?", "NTA.  Your comment was actually mild, and my guess is that the friends only reacted the way they did because Emily has them emotionally beaten down.  This is very much a FAFO moment.", "NTA, Emily sounds bitter that she didn\u2019t get the job she wants, so she puts other people down. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Fuck Emily!", "I mean... She should dish it if she can't take it. NTA.", "NTA your response was pretty tame imo.

You gave her a taste of her own medicine and she didn\u2019t like it.    \n\n\nIn general, it\u2019s better to take the high road than to sink to her level.  The insulting response just ends up reflecting negatively on you. Maybe in the future, just calmly say something like \u201cthat comment was unkind and unnecessary.\u201d   If she continues to defend her rudeness, then tell her that you\u2019re not going to continue interacting if she is going to be make disrespectful comments.   And end the conversation.\n\nGiven that she started the insults, I\u2019d say NTA.", "The clear indicator that Emily is frequently prickly is your other friends ignoring her belittling comments. I bet she\u2019s someone people sigh \u201cyou know how Emily is\u201d. We always want to be our best, and yes you said something you knew would be hurtful, but it was a reaction to a very uncalled for comment.

Likely she is taking her stress out on you in an unproductive way because she is so upset about not getting the placement she wanted. That doesn\u2019t make her comment to you right, but maybe the healthier response would have been something like texting her separately, asking if she is ok, and acknowledging that she is going through a tough time. Also while letting her know that what she said hurt.

Her comment was super mean and your response was tame in comparison. NTA.", "ESH. She was way out of line w/ her comment, so I understand your reaction, but it was still a really hurtful and cruel thing to say", "NTA. She insulted your job, but worse than that, she insulted your character by calling you a corporate stooge. She is clearly bitter and took it out on you. I don\u2019t understand why your friends think what you said to her is worse. It isn\u2019t.", "NTA. clearly we can see why she didn't fit", "If only there were some sort of common saying about people in glass houses throwing stones. NTA. I don't even think your clap back was disproportionate. She was trying to make you feel bad about your job cause she isn't happy with hers. Sounds like it's not the first time you've had this problem with Emily. Honestly , I would be stoked if Emily took this super personally and never talked to me again.", "NTA, your reply was evenly matched with the insult you received. Those saying that you should be the less offended one are elitist and/or are prioritizing Emily's pride in and desire for her career over yours.\n\nI think your response was perfect. Bullys like Emily can dish it out, but seldom have to take it. For once she actually had to \"take a dose of her own medicine\" and she reacted in a way that she would gripe someone else out for reacting if the roles were reversed.", "NTA\n\nSometimes people just invite you to slip the knife between their ribs that you have to.", "NTA\n\nPeople need not be sticking their tongue out if they are afraid of getting it lobbed off.", "NTA - sometimes you have to put people in their place when they say something rude to you", "I disagree with everyone.

Do they all have a God complex?", "NTA, imo the response was appropriate. Internal med thinks you\u2019re less than her. Her friends response confirmed they too think she deserves more respect than you do. Please find yourself a more worthy tribe.", "What does \"matching\" mean in this context? I don't think it works like that in my country.", "As a patient, many of us have had experiences with terribly uptight, dismissive and disrespectful healthcare professional, who refuses to listen to their patient's symptoms, concerns, ideas, etc. Because THEY have the diploma, and they cannot see their patients as anything more than a blob of defective cells with no agency. \n\nEmily is on her way to be a prime example of these terrible doctors who give the whole profession a bad name...", "Op should reiterate this to her \ud83d\ude05", "Dude, not only are you a great friend, you ARE a success.
