If you mom was trying to feed you alligator or something every meal, I could understand expecting her to not serve it to you.

You got called out on eating food eating food with garlic in it and loving it.  I bet your mom has been using the same recipe for the pot pie all your life and it has garlic in it.", "YTA for your smart mouth comment to your mom about forgetting garlic. She didn't forget it, you're just overreacting and don't know what you're talking about.", "YTA. I agree with the sister. If your mom has been cooking it the same all these years, and you don't even taste it in the finished product... then you are just being combative for the sake of it.  You are old enough to accept the 'free' meal someone else has kindly made, or make your own.", "YTA how about cooking for yourself if you want to mess up a meal for everyone", "YTA. I'm with your sister here in that you can make your own food if you don't like what your mom is making. I am a picky eater and my parents have always been pretty accommodating with that. However, I don't throw any tantrums over it if they decide to not accommodate me. I go \"hey what's for dinner? Oh okay, I don't like that. I'll make x after you've finished cooking.\" I don't go in for sarcasm as you did.\n\nHere's a life lesson for you, OP: You're 18 years old, you're starting out in life now you're in college and it's time to realize that you won't always be accommodated, especially if you decide to be snide about it and argue. Use this as a moment to grow and get over it.", "YTA sorry. You approached this like a personal attack on you. All you had to do was politely request if she could limit the garlic while you were visiting. Don't assume she needs to cater to you.", "YTA in this situation. You're being unnecessarily picky about an ingredient that is the base of sooooo many dishes. It sounds like a mental barrier for you knowing it's there rather than it truly being about it being in the food. You're also not allergic. Get over it or make your own food.\n\nNot getting along with your parents is something I can relate to but it sounds like you jumped at the chance to make a dig at your mum. Do you actually want a relationship with your parents? Cause you're going about it all wrong.", "YTA if you\u2019re eating garlic & not noticing. You\u2019re not even allergic you just don\u2019t like it so you can eat literally anything else lol", "YTA - Dictating what others can and can not eat!?  I agree with your mother, if you don't like it - you can make your own.", "YTA. You\u2019re grown enough to make your own food and not be a snarky ass when others cook for you.", "YTA:  You are sounding like a brat. This isn't don't put garlic because I hate the taste, or don't use garlic because I'm allergic.  This is don't use garlic cause I said so. \n\nMake your own food", "It would be one thing If it was an allergy. But if you don\u2019t like it you don\u2019t have to eat it.

Definitely. You had already eaten garlic without realizing it. You mother spent all day cooking food for you just to throw a tantrum over. Grow up and be an adult. Learn to cook for yourself.", "YTA\n\nYou need to grow up and stop being picky. Clearly, you have no issues with garlic because you've eaten and enjoyed food made with garlic. Your favorite meal, the chicken pot pie, has seemingly always been made with garlic, so why is it only now an issue? You're being argumentative for no reason. Your mother did not \"trick\" you into eating garlic, nor has she been \"tricking\" you your entire life. You are most definitely the problem here, not them.", "YTA.\n\nWhy would you start off with the passive aggression like that? That's not smart. Saying \"wow gone for a few months and you forgot I hate garlic.\"\n\nAnd since you aren't allergic and you have and can eat garlic (like in the pasta), it sounds like this is you being a picky eater. That's fine--no reason you need to like all foods. But insisting that your family should all be accommodating your pickiness (instead of you picking the garlic out of the food they all enjoy) is a bit too much.", "YTA for being entitled. You could have come into the kitchen and ASKED the person slaving over this 24 hour recipe to exclude the garlic. Instead, you made a snide and ungrateful comment. You behaved like a brat. Apologize for your attitude and ask that you be told before eating something if it contains garlic. You are not a child anymore. Choose not to act like one.", "YTA you can cook your own food if you hate garlic that much.\n\nBut news flash most dishes you\u2019ll eat will have some form or garlic in it especially garlic powder, eaten at a restaurant? You\u2019ve probably eaten garlic there.", "YTA. That was a very rude. Your mom was cooking for the family, not just you.", "YTA\n\nThat pie obviously always had garlic in it. Everytime your mom made it. You probably would like it less without\n\nYou liked the pasta your mom made with garlic. So clearly you don't actually have a garlic problem, just an attitude one", "YTA, garlic is used as a base for millions of recipes and I very much doubt you don\u2019t notice; in fact I\u2019m sure your Mum didn\u2019t just begin using it in her \u201cextremely good chicken pot pie\u201d\n\nSounds like you have a lot of growing up to do", "Absolutely YTA. Like you said it takes all day to make that dish and you just shit on it? There are other members of the family present, maybe they like garlic? \nOr maybe you are just upset that the entire household didn\u2019t bend to your likes. \nGrow up, you are 18, you can make your own food if what your mom made was that distasteful.", "YTA\n\nMake your own food. \n\nIf you don't like garlic whatever. But you were absolutely rude to you mom cooking all day.", "I mean your mum is kinda right in the sense that you don't know whats in your food if you hate it that much. But why does she have to accomoodate for just you? If you dont like it make your own food. Id be more understanding if it were an allergy but don't shit on someones effort like that. \n\nYTA", "Sorry but YTA, because you obviously CAN eat garlic like you did with the pasta. I suspect your parents have been sneaking it in for a long time and you haven\u2019t noticed. This issue seems to be in your head and you need to deal with it. Also, garlic is so basic in food. If you don\u2019t want to deal with it you have to cook for yourself.\n\nHowever, maybe this isn\u2019t about garlic? There seems to be some tension in the house.", "YTA, and you are too old to act like such a \"brat\".  It's her house  and her food.   Leave and buy your own food.", "YTA- you are an adult, time to start acting like one. It\u2019s only children who refuse to eat or put up a fuss over food they \u2018hate\u2019. I do not like cilantro, I don\u2019t cook with it for myself, however if someone had the grace to cook me food and it contained cilantro I would eat it. I do this because I\u2019m not a child nor am I allergic. When someone cooks you dinner you say thank you. Your mother didn\u2019t \u2018trick\u2019 you she made pasta sauce and you liked it with the garlic. You are definitely being a brat, you really need to get over yourself. Make your own dinner if you are so dissatisfied with the offerings.", "YTA, a massive one! It's not like you're allergic to garlic. It's not like garlic is some exotic, uncommon ingredient. You ate the garlic in the pasta and loved it! This is hilarious! Plus, you're also the AH for trying to tell your mom how to cook in her own home. Ridiculous!", "Just to let you know, garlic is in just about everything. I mean seriously, just every nation has garlic seasoning in their food. It probably won't be as prominent as garlic bread, but its earthy, sweet, pungent flavor is used everywhere!\n\nIf you don't eat your food, you probably eat it everyday.\n\nYTA", "Dude. YTA. Pretty much guarantee her recipe has had garlic in it the entire time you lived at home and you just never noticed because you couldn\u2019t smell it in the food. (Since it seems \u2018smell\u2019 is your trigger for hating it rather than \u2018taste.\u2019). If you don\u2019t like what she cooked then you\u2019re a grown adult. Buy some groceries and make your own meals. She made supper and you acted like an entitled, spoiled brat because you don\u2019t like how she made it.  Thankfully the cure for most teenage AH behavior is time since mine came back from college after their freshman year with much improved attitude over how they were when they left.  We were happy to see their moody asses go when college started and ecstatic to get back reasonable adults after their freshman year ended. Here\u2019s hoping you experience the same growth this year by end of 2nd semester.", "YTA. \n\nShe didn\u2019t \u201ctrick\u201d you. You don\u2019t cook and you\u2019re unaware of what was in the food. Seems like you look for reasons to fight and be an ass.", "YTA\n\nDon't be a picky eater for no reason. Garlic is probably used in that pot pie and always has been.\n\nMaybe take a cooking class?", "Has to be fake  YTA", "Hahahaha oh man this is how my dad is. Never let my mom use garlic when she cooked growing up, my mind was blown when I started cooking for myself and added garlic as recipes suggested. \n\nAnyway, garlic is good for flavor and if used right (unless it\u2019s like a major tasting note of the recipe, like garlic butter chicken) you generally won\u2019t notice it. This is kind of the point your mom made about the pasta. So clearly, you don\u2019t have a high sensitivity to garlic, you just don\u2019t like when it\u2019s noticeable. Also, for people who like the flavor garlic add, things can taste bland without it, so you want everyone in the house else to enjoy their food less so you don\u2019t have to taste something that\u2019s in like most recipes. \n\nUltimately I feel like YTA for being an adult who started an argument over garlic. I mean if she had just crushed/minced it you\u2019re going to smell it in the air but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll taste it. And she\u2019s right, you can cook for yourself if you\u2019re the only one with a problem.", "YTA - you kinda started it. Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds.", "YTA\nYour mum is not a restaurant.", "YTA, very rude and it seems that you are the problem", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet your mom is completely right and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your food since you missed it in your pasta and I doubt your mom had suddenly changed the pot pie recipe and it was always in it.", "YTA, because I\u2019m willing to bet your mom has always put garlic in this dish you claim to love. So, you actually like garlic when it\u2019s used right and you don\u2019t know it\u2019s there. This behavior will always be seen as childish by basically anyone.", "YTA. I would bet cash money that you regularly eat things with garlic and just don\u2019t know it. Because garlic and garlic powder are used as base flavors in almost every cuisine. When someone makes you a home cooked meal (barring food allergies or diabetes or another legitimate reason) you don\u2019t get to complain about how they cook it. Either eat it and say thank you, or pick at it and don\u2019t finish it if it isn\u2019t your taste", "YTA in this situation what\u2019s so wrong about having garlic in the food?? if you have gastro and the garlic + acid makes it worse for you that\u2019s fair enough but it seems like you don\u2019t you just don\u2019t like garlic\u2026 and you should apologise to your mum.", "YTA\n\nEat the food and keep your opinions to yourself or make your own food.", "YTA\n\nI hate onions and will never eat them like on a burger. However, onion does flavor foods and I do like the flavor it helps give foods. Unless it's in huge chunks you can visibly see then it's been cooked down enough that even the texture has been cooked down. Just like the garlic.\n\nOP unless you've gone your whole life not eating red sauce, ketchup, or the myriad of other condiments and sauces I can assure you you've eaten garlic. You like the flavor it imparts but not the texture of the actual garlic, strong flavor, or strong smell but once it's cooked down to where it's not noticable and it's been blended it you don't notice.\n\nDollars to donuts you just never payed close attention when your mom made the pot pie before and only now notice it's had garlic in it this whole time.", "My cooking style can pretty much be summed up as \"white girl with a garlic fetish\", so my first reaction is to roll my eyes.\n\nIt's my second response as well, because it sounds like your mom is right, and you have no idea what goes into the food you actually eat and enjoy. You also sound like you're antagonizing her, and throwing a pity party, which makes me wonder what those fights are about. I suspect it's not just their fault.\n\nAnyway. YTA, for ignorance and entitlement. \n\nAlso, I recommend learning to cook.\n\nEdit: word", "YTA. And a glaring example of why I will never breed. Kids are entitled assholes these days.", "YTA.", "YTA - you're an adult.  You might be at home but in no way shape or form are things the same.    What solidifies you being TAH is that you didn't give any info on the argument that ensued after you found out that you did have garlic and actually liked the dish that it was in.  This completely shoots down your stance.  So this whole \"I hate garlic\" thing seems like you are using it for attention.  Because you did have a dish that had garlic in it and liked it.  Your mom is right for saying \"you can cook your own food\".  You might be at home but you're officially an adult now and if you don't like what's being cooked, then make food for yourself.  No one is obligated to cater to your hang ups.  Those are your responsibility.  Get over yourself and grow up.  The real world is going to be a hell of a lot harder on you than your mom is going to be.", "Yep, YTA. You aren\u2019t allergic to garlic, and you\u2019ve likely eaten it many times without realizing it. You are too old to be so picky and rude about your food preferences.", "YTA. She TRICKED YOU? I just can\u2019t\u2026\u2026. You\u2019re old enough to ask what\u2019s in your food or to make your own. You don\u2019t have to eat what she makes.", "YTA.  You\u2019re acting like a little kid about this. My 7-year-old literally pulls the same thing. You\u2019ve never tasted the garlic before in the pot pie (believe me, it\u2019s always been there) and you\u2019ve loved it. You\u2019ll love it this time too, just get over the mental hurdle.", "Jesus Christ - yes YTA\n\nyou sound like my kids a few years ago when they were 9 & 7 - they hated onions but guess what - they ate in in everything because I put it in a lot of the things I cook.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPretty bad when you are being compared to a 9 & 7 yr old", "The second you made that snarky comment I\u2019d be done cooking for you too.
