What exact state is he in?", "INFO: What are you considering a \"bad state\" that would traumatize your child? Does your ex have a broken leg, 3rd degree burns, or what? Everything is not equivalent in terms of scariness to a kid. \n\nMy kids went to visit people in the hospital when they were small, I tried to impress on them that the hospital is a place where doctors/nurses care for you to help you get better. It's not a scary place.", "More Information: what does your ex look like? Does he have stitches on his face? Tubes coming out of his body? Why was is hard for you to see him like that and why do you think it would be hard for your son?", "Nta that sh*t is scary for little kids. I saw my dad in the hospital after he had surgey when I was 4. I still have nightmares about tubes in noses. It's not fun.\n\nEdit: I sneezed and hit post before I was done", "Info: why do you believe the experience would be traumatizing?", "NTA  - you are responsible for your son\u2019s well being.  Your son visiting the hospital is for your ex\u2019s well being.  At 3, your son doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s his dad, and he is going to be scared that his dad is hurt.  This isn\u2019t the same as going aunt Bessie.  A child, particularly a tender age child needs the security of believing that their parents are ok, and will be there for them.  If their parent is hurt, they are traumatized with worry that the parent is going to be ok.\n\nI was hospitalized for surgery when my son was 7.  My husband brought him to see me after surgery and I really wish he would have just waited until I came home the next day.  I was still on a morphine drip, I was in pain, and it scared him.  It didn\u2019t how much I said I am ok, I will be fine, it was clear that I was not.  He kept asking over and over if I would be ok, and I could see the fear in his eyes, and the only tubes I had was the IV which was scary for him because he could see where it was going into my arm.  By the next day, I was off the morphine drip, and on regular pain killers, and more mobile. It instilled a fear in him that I wasn\u2019t super human and could be gone the next day.  That is frightening to a child.  They need to feel safe and secure and they don\u2019t yet have the maturity to know things will be ok.  They still believe in Santa Claus and the tooth fairy\u2026\n\nYou made the right call, because this is about the emotional well being of your son, and not the ex\u2019s desires.", "NTA.\n\nI was in the same situation with having a 3 year old visit their injured Father in the hospital. It went poorly and my child was stressed and upset for days and suffered night terrors afterwards. \n\nFurthermore, why does the child *need* to go to the hospital? There isn't any reason. The father and his family are thinking more about their feelings than they are the child's. They're the ones being selfish quite honestly. They can wait a few more days until they go home for the child to visit in a more comfortable, less infectious environment.", "NAH. You\u2019re looking out for your kid, but PLEASE keep the same energy when your ex says he doesn\u2019t want the kid to do something/see something he\u2019s not comfortable with.", "NTA - I'm sorry you're having to go through this.", "I see no real valid reason to not wait until he is home. I am surprised your ex & family don't realize the hospital is not a great environment for 3 yr. olds. The risk of exposure to germs, & diseases, and the possibility of them being traumatized by not understanding what is happening with their dad, and why he is hooked up to equipment.\n\nChild's safety & comfort should be the first concern.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Would have done the exact same thing. The kid is three for gods sake. There is plenty of time in life to learn about those things without dragging a small child in to see dad all fucked up in a hospital.", "NTA you are absolutely right.  I had an experience like this with my two year old and an ailing relative in a nursing home. It was so traumatic for him and if I could go back in time I would not put him through that again.", "NTA. There's many good reasons to not bring a child to a hospital including exposing them to injured or sick (contagious) patients. If your ex is going to make a full recovery, it's reasonable to wait until he is better to see his son or do a remote communication like video chat while in hospital. You don't owe your ex's family a visitation.", "NTA. If the dude were on his deathbed, then maybe it'd be different. But, yeah, 3 is pretty young to see someone badly injured like that.", "NTA. It's not about what your ex would like, it's about what's best for your kid. You're not being selfish at all.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about you ex, this is about doing what\u2019s best for your child. \nYou went to see your ex and decided that wasn\u2019t for a child to see, and we\u2019ll have to trust you to know. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t let my 3yo daughter near a hospital, unless it was to say goodbye to a loved one of hers.", "NTA - he's your child, not your exMIL's, although I kind of think I know one reason why she's \"ex\" now.  They don't get to make the call, you do.  Bringing him to visit after hospital release is a perfectly appropriate compromise.  Has anyone even checked about whether kids that young are allowed in the hospital? Because some places have age limits.  Either because they don't want to deal with screaming children, or the fact that kids can't help being little petri dishes and could spread illness to already badly off patients.", "NAH\n\nHe has every right to want to see his kid just in case its the last time, but you also have the responsibility to do whats right for your kid too. And hospitals are traumatizing. I spent years growing up and hanging out with my grandma and the image of her in the hospital has supplanted almost every image of her in my head for over a decade. You did the right thing by checking it out first before making your decision. Ultimately I think if you're honest with them and tell them why in a less charged environment they'll understand.", "It depends on how honest you are describing the situation. Your duty is to protect your son and not to take care of your ex. On the other hand, only you know if you're being vindictive and looking for an excuse or genuinely trying to chose the best for your child.\n\nFrom what you've written, NTA.", "YTA.    Your son is 3 and doesn't understand to the level that you do.    It would be great for his father to see him after trauma.   Take him.", "NAH\n\nWhile I will say I believe you had your child's best interest at heart, having your child visit might have been helpful.  I have a chronic illness and am hospitalized frequently.  It is so much easier on my toddler when he can visit.  It is not traumatizing but instead let's him see for himself that mommy is able to talk to him and is getting better.  My toddler doesn't really like video chats, and while we do that if he can't visit, visiting is so much better for him", "If you want to take the chance that when your son is older he will hear the story of how his dad was hospitalized after an accident and you refused to take him to see his dad, then go ahead with your foolishness. You could always take him so that you control the situation and if your son is upset then remove him. Why make a mountain out of a mole hill? Oh, that is right, YOU don't have fond feelings for him.", "You don\u2019t have fond feelings for your ex husband, so you bar your son from visiting him when it\u2019s what he wants after a traumatic accident? I think your son getting to see his dad is very important and would make you the bigger person. Refusing to let him visit his dad makes you an asshole.\n\nIf your ex husband had ended up in a worse predicament, would you bar your son from attending the funeral?\n\nYou\u2019re using selfish reasons to keep your son from visiting his dad which could brighten your ex husband\u2019s day when he\u2019s going through a rough time, but you clearly don\u2019t care about that. This isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s about your son and letting him be there for his dad.\n\nYTA.", "I kinda feel like YTA here. Have you even asked your son if he wanted to go see his dad? I don't really feel like it's your call alone to make. It was all about your feelings so two things can be true at the same time you can want to do whats best for your son and be selfish at the same time.", "YTA. What happens when something goes wrong and he never gets to go home?", "YTA.\n\nI'll be charitable here and assume that you're truly only thinking of protecting your son. But to the extent that you're trying do even that, it's just unnecessary pampering. Use it as a teachable moment instead. People get sick, have violent accidents, die ... those are just realities of life that everybody has to get used to.", "ESH\n\nAt 3, your son won\u2019t remember how his dad looked while in hospital. Seeing his kid would cheer your ex up at a time when he probably feels miserable and you simply want to deny him that.\n\nThe ex is as bad as you. You both are using your kid to cause problems for the other", "YTA. You are trying to find excuses to keep you kid away from his dad.\n\nA kid is never too young to learn what a hospital is and what being sick is.", "Info: was his dad waking up from surgery or from a coma in ICU? Did he physically look bad? What are his injuries?", "Nta", "YTA you haven\u2019t even explain why you refuse to let your son see his father and it\u2019s frankly sounding vindictive at this point.", "YTA. That is the kid's father and you're withholding him. You're sheltering the kid from reality. Things like this happen. You've managed to even taint the relationship you had with your ex-MIL with this, a relationship you said was good. You should be ashamed.", "NTA.  You are correct - he is only 3.  Seeing his father like that is not appropriate.  It's no wonder he's your ex.  His whole family is trash.", "YTA", "NTA\n\nYou made the right choice to visit first to assess the situation.  \n\nIf your ex is going to make a recovery, I would wait.  If he will likely succumb to his injuries, I would take your child to see him and say good-bye.\n\nHospitals are not a place for children; lots of germs.", "Esh...depending on exactly how banged up he was i don't see anything wrong with him visiting.....no one should be calling.people out for behaviors and yes you should protect kid from unsettling details yet of he had no visible scars and just a few bruises and bumps no harm no foul.", "YTA. What is all this nonsense about being \u201ctraumatized\u201d? Sickness and death are part of life. Humans - and children - have lived with this for thousands of years. Kids are resilient. All these kids today who fall apart at the slightest difficulty is because they were shielded from pain and discomfort for most of their lives. This is entirely modern phenomena where children are shielded from people who are suffering", "Honestly dont even know who TA is here but I\u2019ll give you a pass on this one as long as when your ex throws it back you keep that energy and be a big girl who takes responsibility for her actions. Your ex will throw this back at you and you at least owe him a chance at healthy communication when he\u2019s out.", "I don\u2019t know if I agree with not bringing him, I suppose that would depend on the details of the m what \u201cseeing him like that\u201d means. \n\nBut as far as the family goes I would tell his mom that the easy and selfish thing to do would be to just bring him to get her off your back & stop the insults & pressure. That you truly believe it is not in your son\u2019s best interest so you are willing to take the criticism & anger rather than do something you believe will harm your child. That you understand that she is trying to do what\u2019s best for her son, and hope that she can understand that you are doing what\u2019s best for yours.", "I seriously can\u2019t believe all the people agreeing with OP.  Your child\u2019s father had an accident.  You should take the child to see him.", "YTA. When you shield your kid from the bad/scary parts of life, they end up unable to cope when they are older. Sure, some things can be too much, and it's a tough call at times, but your ex is not lying on the side of the road in a bloody mess; he's in the hospital and has been attended to. Even if he was badly injured, I don't think this is one of those times where you need to shield your child from the very sight of him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When I first woke up I was confused. It took a few days before I was mentally ok. His family can ask but until he does don't take your son there. A hospital is not a place for a child due to germs plus boredom. Yes, you can leave at anytime but depending on how time with dad normally goes this could be a bad experience for your son. Make sure ex understands that when he feels up to seeing son you will bring him. Don't let anyone else dictate your sons time at this age.", "Uh, this is really overwrought.", "How is this going to hurt the child?", "How is that a compromise ?", "This could backfire in a massive, massive way.", "[deleted]", "He\u2019s three.

Especially icu areas. So it may not even be a possibility. \n\nI could also make the argument it is rsv season and 3 years old can catch it so a hospital probably isn\u2019t a place for a toddler wanting to touch stuff.", "They certainly can be if he has facial trauma, stitches, etc", "Oh he most certainly will if it\u2019s upsetting enough. What you are saying is a fallacy. If something is traumatic you can most certainly remember things from this age- I have memories from before I was age 2 due to their traumatic nature.\n\nIn this situation it all comes down to the nature of the visible injuries and how much the dad looks and sounds as the child remembers- not the dads feelings! Whether OP is the ah or not entirely depends on the severity of the injuries /incapacity and longevity of the situation (if dad will be  showing signs of his injuries for a long time then the son may as well see him and begin adjusting) otherwise it\u2019s best to let things return more to normal, for the child\u2019s sake.", "I certainly remember the hole in my father\u2019s head he got from an open window when I was three. It wasn\u2019t deep, but seeing blood and someone clearly not being okay was kinda confusing and a bit traumatising. \n\nSo I\u2019d say NTA for visiting without the kid first to see how bad he looks, but if it\u2019s not horrible I\u2019d take the kid the next time.", "Patently untrue. Depending on the circumstances it could be incredibly traumatizing for the child. Putting the child\u2019s needs and interests first is what every parent\u2019s job is.", "I'm making assumptions by the statement that it would be nice for the ex to see kid when he wakes up, which leads me to wonder if he's in a coma, if the adult mom is disturbed by the sight of the injuries, there's a pretty good chance a 3yr old would be as well, and a 3yr old is not capable of understanding any medical stuff at the same level of comprehension as an adult. A 3yr old is not going to understand injuries that look a lot more significant than they actually are.", "There might be a new edit because the op also states the ex directly asked for the son too", "Did you not read?

As far as we know he could have some cuts and bruises. Also they are both responsible for making decisions for their child. She has not stated she has full custody so as far as we know it's a joint decision to be made. The OP made it about her she even admits that because she doesn't have fond feelings for her ex she didn't think it was a good idea to let their son see him.

Seeing a parent in the hospital is a lot. It\u2019s scary for a kid. IVs and any wires or tubes. It doesn\u2019t take much to cause emotional scarring for a toddler.

Did you actually explain why you were hesitant to bring your son? Your text saying \u201choping they would understand\u201d suggests you did not try to communicate anything with them. \n\nIt sounds like considering your ex was unconscious it was a pretty serious accident. If I were in your shoes I would have tried to gauge the situation better and ask if maybe it would be better to bring son around when ex was conscious again. That being said, since ex asked to see his son while he was in the hospital, I don\u2019t really see why that wouldn\u2019t be a reasonable request. Discharge is a pita.

I'm not a parent but I've been a child who saw their parent in the hospital at a young age and it was not traumatic whatsoever.", "Whoa, why are you asking such personal questions of others here?", "This!  the iv machines and the load noises is enough to scare a 3 year old.
