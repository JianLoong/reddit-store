The fact that you say he's going home soon suggests things aren't that serious.  My kids went to visit people in the hospital when they were small, I tried to impress on them that the hospital is a place where doctors/nurses care for you to help you get better. It's not a scary place.", "More Information: what does your ex look like? Does he have stitches on his face? Tubes coming out of his body?

I saw my dad in the hospital after he had surgey when I was 4. I still have nightmares about tubes in noses. It's not fun.\n\nEdit: I sneezed and hit post before I was done", "Info: why do you believe the experience would be traumatizing?", "NTA  - you are responsible for your son\u2019s well being.  Your son visiting the hospital is for your ex\u2019s well being.  At 3, your son doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s his dad, and he is going to be scared that his dad is hurt.  This isn\u2019t the same as going aunt Bessie.  A child, particularly a tender age child needs the security of believing that their parents are ok, and will be there for them.  If their parent is hurt, they are traumatized with worry that the parent is going to be ok.\n\nI was hospitalized for surgery when my son was 7.  My husband brought him to see me after surgery and I really wish he would have just waited until I came home the next day.  I was still on a morphine drip, I was in pain, and it scared him.  It didn\u2019t how much I said I am ok, I will be fine, it was clear that I was not.  He kept asking over and over if I would be ok, and I could see the fear in his eyes, and the only tubes I had was the IV which was scary for him because he could see where it was going into my arm.  By the next day, I was off the morphine drip, and on regular pain killers, and more mobile. It instilled a fear in him that I wasn\u2019t super human and could be gone the next day.  That is frightening to a child.  They need to feel safe and secure and they don\u2019t yet have the maturity to know things will be ok.

There is plenty of time in life to learn about those things without dragging a small child in to see dad all fucked up in a hospital.", "NTA you are absolutely right.  I had an experience like this with my two year old and an ailing relative in a nursing home. It was so traumatic for him and if I could go back in time I would not put him through that again.", "NTA. There's many good reasons to not bring a child to a hospital including exposing them to injured or sick (contagious) patients. If your ex is going to make a full recovery, it's reasonable to wait until he is better to see his son or do a remote communication like video chat while in hospital. You don't owe your ex's family a visitation.", "NTA. If the dude were on his deathbed, then maybe it'd be different. But, yeah, 3 is pretty young to see someone badly injured like that.", "NTA.

And hospitals are traumatizing. I spent years growing up and hanging out with my grandma and the image of her in the hospital has supplanted almost every image of her in my head for over a decade.

Ultimately I think if you're honest with them and tell them why in a less charged environment they'll understand.", "It depends on how honest you are describing the situation.

Your son is 3 and doesn't understand to the level that you do.    It would be great for his father to see him after trauma.   Take him.", "NAH\n\nWhile I will say I believe you had your child's best interest at heart, having your child visit might have been helpful.  I have a chronic illness and am hospitalized frequently.  It is so much easier on my toddler when he can visit.  It is not traumatizing but instead let's him see for himself that mommy is able to talk to him and is getting better.  My toddler doesn't really like video chats, and while we do that if he can't visit, visiting is so much better for him", "If you want to take the chance that when your son is older he will hear the story of how his dad was hospitalized after an accident and you refused to take him to see his dad, then go ahead with your foolishness.

I think your son getting to see his dad is very important and would make you the bigger person. Refusing to let him visit his dad makes you an asshole.\n\nIf your ex husband had ended up in a worse predicament, would you bar your son from attending the funeral?\n\nYou\u2019re using selfish reasons to keep your son from visiting his dad which could brighten your ex husband\u2019s day when he\u2019s going through a rough time, but you clearly don\u2019t care about that.

People get sick, have violent accidents, die ... those are just realities of life that everybody has to get used to.", "ESH\n\nAt 3, your son won\u2019t remember how his dad looked while in hospital.

That is the kid's father and you're withholding him. You're sheltering the kid from reality. Things like this happen. You've managed to even taint the relationship you had with your ex-MIL with this, a relationship you said was good. You should be ashamed.", "NTA.  You are correct - he is only 3.

What is all this nonsense about being \u201ctraumatized\u201d? Sickness and death are part of life. Humans - and children - have lived with this for thousands of years. Kids are resilient.

That you truly believe it is not in your son\u2019s best interest so you are willing to take the criticism & anger rather than do something you believe will harm your child. That you understand that she is trying to do what\u2019s best for her son, and hope that she can understand that you are doing what\u2019s best for yours.", "I seriously can\u2019t believe all the people agreeing with OP.  Your child\u2019s father had an accident.  You should take the child to see him.", "YTA. When you shield your kid from the bad/scary parts of life, they end up unable to cope when they are older. Sure, some things can be too much, and it's a tough call at times, but your ex is not lying on the side of the road in a bloody mess; he's in the hospital and has been attended to. Even if he was badly injured, I don't think this is one of those times where you need to shield your child from the very sight of him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hospitals are full of sick and frail people who can't handle the germs that little kids pick up all the time.", "You say it isn't about the ex, but it kind of is since he was the one in the accident and needing/wanting to see his child. It's about both of them. So the question becomes, is there a way to go about it that doesn't completely invalidate ex's feeling of need to see his son? Maybe a Facetime call that could limit the kid's field of vision so he doesn't get overexposed to the scary stuff?", "See, I get what you're saying. I get what everyone is saying. But why is it that y'all's best solution is to completely invalidate the feelings and needs of the person who is injured, in physical pain, and probably also in the emotional distress that comes along with it?", "Man, I was 7 when my little sister was born, and I remember going to visit my mom in the hospital afterward and seeing all the cables and tubes. I was scared shitless of the hospital for year. Hell, it's been 20 years and it still freaks me out if I think about it too much.", "My dad was in a very serious accident when I was two. He was in the hospital over a year and I remember bits and pieces. The first time I saw him he was in a halo and his finger was black. I remember sitting on his gurney with him. It wasn't traumatic. It was seeing my dad.", ">I would trust the mother on what she feels her child can handle.\n\nBut you wouldn\u2019t trust the father on what he feels his child can handle?", "When did I say otherwise?", "Not invalidating, though upon reflection I should\u2019ve said NAH. The in-laws need to lay off OP - they are being AHs. The dad, not an AH.", "I saw my grandpa in the hospital the day he passed of leukemia, I was 12.\n\nMy grandma got pneumonia and it killed her (due to lung cancer). I was 19, and my mom called me and told me that my grandma was no longer mentally there--just in a coma--and hooked up to what looked like a million wires, tubes, and machines. She knew how close I was to my grandma, and wanted to give me a fair picture of what grandma looked like. All I could remember was how my grandpa looked 7 years earlier, and I just *couldn't*. It was too much for me as a 19 year old to do it again. I don't *regret* that I saw my grandpa when I was 12, but I do wish that I had been older to better understand.\n\nI think OP is right to protect her son. I can't even begin to imagine how terrifying an accident could make the ex look, and traumatise their son. 3 year olds shouldn't have to see such things if it can be helped. I'm sorry you had to see something like that.", "Nah...you're right.\n\nMy grandpa was eventually put in a nursing home when my parents could no longer care for him at home. He had advanced dementia and was on a feeding tube BEFORE they put him in the nursing home (I once watched my dad do CPR on him in our hallway while my mom went out and flagged down the ambulance...that was also awful!). We had to visit him every Sunday. Us kids hated visiting him (he was on death's doorstep and it was scary!), but our parents only made us come in and say hi to him briefly before letting us go wait in the lounge. A positive was that the more mobile and active people in the home LOVED seeing some kids around, and would sit down in the lounge with us and chat, play games, etc. We actually ended up enjoying the visits...grandpa was scary because he was nearly dead, but hanging out with the other residents who could play a game or talk with us was kinda fun.\n\nThe only thing that still squicks me out about full-on nursing home care or \"memory care\" facilities is that all the residents always want to \"escape.\" I know that their minds are not there, but it's kinda scary thinking that I might be there at some point. My great-aunt (stroke took her ability to live independently) was in an amazing home...beautiful facilities, great food, friends and family coming by to visit often...and all she wanted to do was leave. Not being able to get on my bike, or get in a car, and go and do and see, that's...hard to think about.", "I hope everything goes well for his surgery!", "At my hospital no visitors under 12 years old are permitted, we still have fairly strict visitor restrictions. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a 3 year old was not allowed to visit.", "My mom came home with a perm once & I was terrified & hid under the table from Not Mom. I doubt I'd have been able to handle seeing her in the hospital after am accident.", "Thank you!", "I get that it is only a few years, but there is a big difference, mentally, between a 3 year old and a 6 year old, or even a 5 year old, and what they are able to understand and deal with. It's also probably pretty child dependent, to the point that if a parent, either parent, has concerns about the child's ability to handle it, it's probably best to play it safe. I would agree with NAH on the terms you mention, but I think the way ex's family behaved makes them pretty solid AHs imo", "Ok, then no one should ever visit sick people in the hospital ever, even if they ask and it would bring them some minor relief and hope."]}
