Everything is not equivalent in terms of scariness to a kid. The fact that you say he's going home soon suggests things aren't that serious.\n\nMy kids went to visit people in the hospital when they were small, I tried to impress on them that the hospital is a place where doctors/nurses care for you to help you get better. It's not a scary place.", "More Information: what does your ex look like? Does he have stitches on his face? Tubes coming out of his body? Why was is hard for you to see him like that and why do you think it would be hard for your son?", "Nta that sh*t is scary for little kids. I saw my dad in the hospital after he had surgey when I was 4. I still have nightmares about tubes in noses. It's not fun.\n\nEdit: I sneezed and hit post before I was done", "Info: why do you believe the experience would be traumatizing?", "NTA  - you are responsible for your son\u2019s well being.  Your son visiting the hospital is for your ex\u2019s well being.  At 3, your son doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s his dad, and he is going to be scared that his dad is hurt.  This isn\u2019t the same as going aunt Bessie.  A child, particularly a tender age child needs the security of believing that their parents are ok, and will be there for them.  If their parent is hurt, they are traumatized with worry that the parent is going to be ok.\n\nI was hospitalized for surgery when my son was 7.  My husband brought him to see me after surgery and I really wish he would have just waited until I came home the next day.  I was still on a morphine drip, I was in pain, and it scared him.  It didn\u2019t how much I said I am ok, I will be fine, it was clear that I was not.  He kept asking over and over if I would be ok, and I could see the fear in his eyes, and the only tubes I had was the IV which was scary for him because he could see where it was going into my arm.  By the next day, I was off the morphine drip, and on regular pain killers, and more mobile. It instilled a fear in him that I wasn\u2019t super human and could be gone the next day.  That is frightening to a child.  They need to feel safe and secure and they don\u2019t yet have the maturity to know things will be ok.

It went poorly and my child was stressed and upset for days and suffered night terrors afterwards. \n\nFurthermore, why does the child *need* to go to the hospital? There isn't any reason. The father and his family are thinking more about their feelings than they are the child's. They're the ones being selfish quite honestly.

I am surprised your ex & family don't realize the hospital is not a great environment for 3 yr. olds.

There is plenty of time in life to learn about those things without dragging a small child in to see dad all fucked up in a hospital.", "NTA you are absolutely right.  I had an experience like this with my two year old and an ailing relative in a nursing home. It was so traumatic for him and if I could go back in time I would not put him through that again.", "NTA. There's many good reasons to not bring a child to a hospital including exposing them to injured or sick (contagious) patients. If your ex is going to make a full recovery, it's reasonable to wait until he is better to see his son or do a remote communication like video chat while in hospital. You don't owe your ex's family a visitation.", "NTA. If the dude were on his deathbed, then maybe it'd be different. But, yeah, 3 is pretty young to see someone badly injured like that.", "NTA.

They don't get to make the call, you do.  Bringing him to visit after hospital release is a perfectly appropriate compromise.  Has anyone even checked about whether kids that young are allowed in the hospital? Because some places have age limits.

And hospitals are traumatizing. I spent years growing up and hanging out with my grandma and the image of her in the hospital has supplanted almost every image of her in my head for over a decade.

Ultimately I think if you're honest with them and tell them why in a less charged environment they'll understand.", "It depends on how honest you are describing the situation. Your duty is to protect your son and not to take care of your ex.

Your son is 3 and doesn't understand to the level that you do.    It would be great for his father to see him after trauma.   Take him.", "NAH\n\nWhile I will say I believe you had your child's best interest at heart, having your child visit might have been helpful.  I have a chronic illness and am hospitalized frequently.  It is so much easier on my toddler when he can visit.  It is not traumatizing but instead let's him see for himself that mommy is able to talk to him and is getting better.  My toddler doesn't really like video chats, and while we do that if he can't visit, visiting is so much better for him", "If you want to take the chance that when your son is older he will hear the story of how his dad was hospitalized after an accident and you refused to take him to see his dad, then go ahead with your foolishness.

I think your son getting to see his dad is very important and would make you the bigger person. Refusing to let him visit his dad makes you an asshole.\n\nIf your ex husband had ended up in a worse predicament, would you bar your son from attending the funeral?\n\nYou\u2019re using selfish reasons to keep your son from visiting his dad which could brighten your ex husband\u2019s day when he\u2019s going through a rough time, but you clearly don\u2019t care about that.

What happens when something goes wrong and he never gets to go home?", "YTA.\n\nI'll be charitable here and assume that you're truly only thinking of protecting your son.

People get sick, have violent accidents, die ... those are just realities of life that everybody has to get used to.", "ESH\n\nAt 3, your son won\u2019t remember how his dad looked while in hospital.

That is the kid's father and you're withholding him. You're sheltering the kid from reality. Things like this happen. You've managed to even taint the relationship you had with your ex-MIL with this, a relationship you said was good. You should be ashamed.", "NTA.  You are correct - he is only 3.

What is all this nonsense about being \u201ctraumatized\u201d? Sickness and death are part of life. Humans - and children - have lived with this for thousands of years. Kids are resilient.

That you truly believe it is not in your son\u2019s best interest so you are willing to take the criticism & anger rather than do something you believe will harm your child. That you understand that she is trying to do what\u2019s best for her son, and hope that she can understand that you are doing what\u2019s best for yours.", "I seriously can\u2019t believe all the people agreeing with OP.  Your child\u2019s father had an accident.  You should take the child to see him.", "YTA. When you shield your kid from the bad/scary parts of life, they end up unable to cope when they are older. Sure, some things can be too much, and it's a tough call at times, but your ex is not lying on the side of the road in a bloody mess; he's in the hospital and has been attended to. Even if he was badly injured, I don't think this is one of those times where you need to shield your child from the very sight of him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Whether OP is the ah or not entirely depends on the severity of the injuries /incapacity and longevity of the situation (if dad will be  showing signs of his injuries for a long time then the son may as well see him and begin adjusting) otherwise it\u2019s best to let things return more to normal, for the child\u2019s sake.", "I certainly remember the hole in my father\u2019s head he got from an open window when I was three.

No, your son does not belong in the hospital.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, not an AH for going to see him first without your son to assess the situation. Seeing a parent- or anyone- severely injured can be traumatizing, and no matter how many times you say \"daddy will be okay\" the visual says otherwise. \n\nSecond, after assessing the situation, you decided it did look bad and not good for your son to see him. If he is stable and likely to go home, then this is the right course of action for your son, because it isn't like a \"final goodbye\" scenario. \n\nFinally, your son doesn't benefit from seeing his dad in the hospital. He is 3 and doesn't really understand what is going on. If he was older or asked to see his dad to make sure he was okay, then of course you should take him.

My son kept asking me to see his uncle, and once my brother was in rehab I took him (he was in the ICU previously, so my son couldn't go anyway because of his age). My son cried and ended up running out of the room. And he's 21 now and if you ask him now he'll tell you how traumatized he was. I sat him down before we went, I explained as much as I could, but it still didn't sink in until we were there, and he was older than your son. I can't imagine taking a younger child!

I was not traumatized by what I saw so depending on his dad's shape (as others already said- if he is in a state where he isn't recognizable, it's totally understandable that you don't want your son to see that) you might want to reconsider because kids can be tougher than you think.\nAlso what about your son?
