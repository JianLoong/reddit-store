I am a photographer, and even though it isn\u2019t my full time job, I do make a bit of money from it from friends and family. She asked me to photograph and I happily set up the shoot. And I think the pictures looked good.\n\nI sent her the pictures and told her it would be $200 and she left me on read for a while. She said she expected it to be free.

Two free haircuts and you won't enforce the bill for photography. You're both professionals at your respective trades and you're only asking for a courtesy you extended when they were starting out.\n\nThere's a kind of person in the world who will always overvalue themselves and devalue others.\n\nThen again, maybe the haircuts are worth it?", "What we have here is a failure to communicate.\n\nWhen friends ask about photos it\u2019s very easy to say. \u201cI\u2019d love to take pictures for you. I charge $200 for a sitting. When would you like to schedule?\u201d\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have assumed they were free. And you should have let her know the price beforehand. \n\nYWBTA if you walked out without paying but you may want to consider if you want to continue using her services since she stiffed you.", "NTA. She never gave you free stuff or even a discount, I\u2019m not sure why she feels entitled to that treatment. She is the AH for taking advantage of you and your services, though the price should\u2019ve been established beforehand to avoid this situation.", "NTA- But I wouldn\u2019t do that as something very bad might stir from that, other than you two not being friends. Did you send her the pictures? Does she have them in her possession? I would try to confront her in person when you get your hair done and then talk to her to see if she would be down to let you collect some loss.", "Nta, what your friend did is illegal and she's entitled. Next time talk about the price before, learn from this.\nText her that since she never did anything free for you, ask her why does she expected the contrary from you.", "NTA, but you'd open yourself up to criticism if you do what you're planning. She can spin the narrative negatively once she has the ammo. Go and ask for the money directly. Preferably when there are other customers. Don't let her fob you off.", "Instead of getting the haircut and walking out, maybe try suggesting this trade first.", "ESH.\n\nThe two of you lack communication skills.\n\nI disagree with other posters re: stiffing on tips.  Owners of these types of businesses don't typically get tips because they keep all the funds earned.", "The way you plan to recoup the money, YWBTA. \n\nTalk to her about a payment plan. And you can float the idea of two free haircuts to pay for the work. Don't just stiff her. \n\nAnd you can go find another stylist.", "NTA for how you feel and you ARE entitled to be paid but PLEASE do not attempt to get a free hair cut. The old saying \u201ctwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right\u201d. \n\nTry this,  send her a \u201cThank You\u201d card to collect the money. In the card thank her for supporting your business they way you\u2019ve happily supported hers for the last 5 years, and end it with I really appreciate you paying the $200 in a timely fashion. Hope you loved the pictures!", "YWNBTA. She expects full price for her services, she should expect to pay full price for yours. If you end up no longer being friends because of it, you're better off without her.", "Come on, you are going there for years and you always pay. You can\u2019t just stop. You can offer her before the appointment that you guys are even with the cut.

Did she discuss price beforehand when she asked you and all your friends to give up your regular stylists and switch to her? In both cases these situations came up at her initiation.

Your friend was clearly opening up a new business and expecting to earn money from it. You have a side hustle you don't seem to push that much. You both should have clarified fees, just like you should have last time with the haircut, but it's not unreasonable that she thought this one time thing might have been free. You did the same thing when you got the hair cut. So, unless you think she's stealing your photos, give her some time to come up with the money, then forgive and forget.", "ESH, she didn't ask for a price and just expected it to be a favor among friends, like you did when she first started her bussines but unlike her, you just paid and said nothing. You didn't tell her the price upfront and you got petty because she didn't give you a free haircut when she started. Either confront her, communicate better and reach a compromise or go somewhere else for your haircut/hair coloring  from now on.", "YTA for expecting a free haircut/color from someone with a new business. If she did that for everyone, she wouldn't be able to keep the lights on. \nYTA for not tipping well because again, she has bills to pay too, and if you'd tip someone else for a great job, you should do the same for her. \n\nYTA for not telling her you were going to charge her for the pictures ahead of time, and YWBTA and doing something illegal if you get a cut and don't pay her.\n\nWork it out as a trade ahead of time, pay her and don't argue about what she owes you, or just don't go.", "In this situation, it does not appear that you are the asshole. You   \noffered your services as a photographer to your friend and agreed on a   \nprice for your services. Your friend agreed to pay that price and then   \nfailed to follow through on that agreement. While it may be tempting to   \nwithhold payment for your upcoming haircut, this would likely damage   \nyour relationship with your friend and could potentially be seen as   \nretaliatory. Instead, it would be best to communicate openly with your   \nfriend about the situation and try to come to a resolution. NTA.", "YTA if you do that. Why don't you just ask if she would rather pay you in trade by providing hair services?", "Ywbta.  Offering the photos for 2 free haircuts sounds like a good compromise if: 1. You trust her to honor this 2. Do you really want to trust your hair to an entitled stylist who is unhappy with you? It\u2019d be a solid no from me.", "ESH. \n\nYou would be the AH for just walking out without paying, but your friend sucks for expecting a free photoshoot when they haven\u2019t given you so much as a 10% discount. If you\u2019re going to go with the free haircut method I would definitely be the bigger person and communicate that cutting your hair for free a couple times is the least she could do if she can\u2019t properly compensate you.", "Asshole or not If I were you I\u2019d go to that appointment and leave without paying.", "YWBTA if you did this. However, you are within your rights to make her aware that she owes you payment for your time or you will pursue collection from her.", "~~NTA~~\n\n~~That's exactly how you should treat AH.~~\n\nSorry, came back to say, you would be the AH but a justified one. People here are offering solutions who would work with someone you can talk things with. She doesn't seem that type of person so if you feel confident with trusting her touching your hair, go for it. If not, just ditch her from you life and now you know, always talk money ESPECIALLY with people you know.", "How about you talk to her?  You can even show her this post. Work out a trade. Her haircut ting skills in exchange for your photography skills. YWBTA if you just walk out.", "This!  By far the best solution. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t explain the pricing in advance, I should have been more clear. I know money is tight for everyone this time of year- would you be comfortable with doing 2 free haircuts instead and we will call it even?\u201d\n\nOh, and have that convo BEFORE you go to the salon.", "Yes she has the pictures already. \n\nConfronting her does seem like the more mature way to go about this. Urgh.", "You\u2019re absolutely right. I should have discussed price upfront beforehand. Lesson learnt.", "this. \u21e7\n\nOne face to face honest talk about everything will help. Friendship may change, but honest communication is everything. \n\nAnd you let the hair / money thing go on for 5 years. That's a lot of resentment built up. No wonder she was surprised to get a $200 invoice.\n\nESH", "I only do photography part time, so I don\u2019t have a website listing prices or anything.\n\nFrankly, I think I just got all wrapped up in organizing the location for the shoot and the date, we were both excited about it and she asked me for advice on outfits and everything. I guess I just forgot to mention my price.", "Why should the friend not expect to be charged for the pictures? Why is it okay for her to expect a freebie but not OP?", "Except OP never gave her a price to agree upon.", "OP gave her the price after taking the photos and sending them to her. They didn't agree on it beforehand.", "I would want my money too, $200 is a lot so I don\u2019t blame you. Maybe try calling her or confronting her in person to see if you both can establish some type of agreement.", "It doesn't have to be a confrontation. Talk to her.", "Nta but call and ask her if  your  next two  visits  at her salon will be the payment  for  the photos.  If she's  not ok with it then change salons and tell her she needs to pay you  in installments  if not all at once  starting now.", "Just do it AFTER the haircut. If you confront her before or during the cut, it may get ugly, and I mean it in ALL the ways!", "Small claims court.", "I\u2019m 100% guessing OP said yes just to finally get revenge on friend.", "I'm going with YTA. $200 is too big a surprise to spring on someone. Not saying your services aren't worth that price, but you need to get agreement *before* services rendered to avoid this kind of misunderstanding.", "I didn't say she shouldn't expect to get paid.\nI said she should have communicated it ahead of time.\nNobody should provide a service without discussing price first. Especially for something that complicated  time consuming, and relatively costly.\nThey're both at fault for that, but walking out without paying for a haircut isn't going to make anything better, hence my suggestion to work it out ahead of time. Getting your hair done can be a close to $200 thing, so that and x dollars may be a fair \"trade.\"", "You're right, the original poster OP didn't specify a price   \nbeforehand. But they did discuss the price with their friend and come to  \nan agreement after the photoshoot. I stand by my original comment that   \nit's not fair for the friend to not follow through on that agreement.", "You're right, the original poster OP didn't specify a price beforehand. But they did discuss the price with their friend and come to an agreement after the photoshoot. Even though the price wasn't agreed upon beforehand, it was still a legitimate agreement and it's not fair for the friend to not follow through on it.

There is no claim to make in court."]}
