She is amazing and has been the light of my life since she\u2019s been born. Her mother and I split when she was about a year old due to a plethora of issues in our relationship, but co parent/get along just fine, until recently. \n\nLet me preface this by saying my child\u2019s mother has incredible self esteem issues. She is a perfectionist and cares very much about the image she puts out to others. It is part of the reason we are no longer together today. Her social media accounts are full of photos who barely even look like herself due to the fact that she uses these apps to heavily edit them (not just filters/colors, actually changing her facial features). She has even went as far to edit me as well in photos of us together. When I asked her about this one time, she broke down crying, and I have already previously known about her insecurities so I let it go as to not upset her further. \n\nFast forward to after the birth of our daughter, she creates an Instagram account for her. It started off innocent, just normal pictures and videos of our daughter. So I had no issues about this. Of course, I monitor the account heavily (even though I don\u2019t run it nor have access to it) so as of recently I began to notice some\u2026 troubling things. Long story short, my daughters mother has been posting edited photos of her (in the same way she does herself) to the account. \n\nI was not OK with this. I called her and asked why she thought this was appropriate, and at first she denied it, but when actually comparing a photo to my real life daughter it\u2019s obvious. Finally she just said she sees no harm in this and that this wasn\u2019t the problem I\u2019m making it out to be. \n\nI basically told her that I am not comfortable with this whatsoever, and that even though she doesn\u2019t understand now it could be potentially damaging to project her insecurities onto our daughter. I told her if she continued, I would be taking action, she did, and I got the account removed. \n\nThe account had a large following and apparently she was getting brand deals/free items from it, so she called me the AH for having the page removed when she saw no issue begin with. I told her to not post her on SM again.

NtA. Children should get to choose if their entire life is posted online not have the choice made for them", "NTA Your ex is using your daughter as a dress up doll and is making money off of her without your consent. There are also so many creeps online, you are definitely in the right.", "NTA in any possible way. What you're doing is protecting your child.\n\nThere is so much wrong with what your ex is doing. The filters and editing of photos is just the surface layer of this massive pile of terrible parenting and exploitation she's exhibiting.\n\nFirst off, I despise parents that use their children as a means to get social media standing. They're a damn baby, they can't consent to having their image plastered all over IG, FB, or whatever social media site you choose to use.\n\nSecond, she's literally exploiting your daughter for what amounts to financial gain and free merchandise at the cost of your daughter's privacy and setting her up for a life of insecurities and trust issues.\n\nOP, you need to get custody of your daughter. I promise you this wont be the only time your ex tries this. You might have gotten the IG taken down, but who's to say she wont try on another site like TikTok or YouTube.", "NTA and you are absolutely right. Children shouldn\u2019t be on social media, there are tons of creeps out there who will do nasty things while looking at those pictures of your daughter. And your daughter will probably grow up with self-esteem issues too since her mother feels the need to edit her appearance.", "NTA because you\u2019re right that this could have a negative effect when she\u2019s older. Sure, at the moment she can\u2019t understand, but if your ex is how you described, this probably won\u2019t stop. I feel badly for your ex because it sounds like she\u2019s really struggling, but it\u2019s not something to rope your toddler into. \n\nAlso, just curious, what is she editing in the photos of your daughter?\n\nEdit: said wife instead of ex", "NTA really irresponsible to do this with a child even without edits. Id get this worked into your custody agreement.", "NTA. Is your child's mother in therapy? Because she needs it. And if you haven't already, please go to court and make this arrangement legal. If you do 50/50 custody, you won't have to pay child support in most states (I think; I am ready to be corrected, however).", "NTA \n\nChildren often mirror their parents accidentally. Lots of kids develop self esteem and body issues from just watching their parents hate themselves. \n\nShe needs to get a grip on this and seek some professional help before she teaches her daughter that the only way she is acceptable is after photoshop \u201cfixes\u201d what\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d with her face and body.", "NTA it is deeply concerning and as that kid ages will become more important, more damaging. She'll raise a mini-me with the same neuroses.\n\nI think you two need couples  counselling (yes, I know you are no longer together as a couple, but you are tied for life by this kid, you need guidance on how to negotiate your co-parenting)  \u2014 ideally before you need  a lawyer and a court to issue some kind of restraint on her. She also needs mental health counselling but good luck with THAT :-(", "NTA for not wanting her to essentially pimp out your toddler for free stuff through, like, baby glamour shots, but I don't think you can really force her to stop posting *any* pictures. If she quits it with the filters and decides to share normal baby photos with family and friends, I don't think you could reasonably demand that she stop or get the profile removed.\n\nDo you have a formal custody agreement? If so, is seeking an amended agreement a possibility? Could conditions be added that either require her to seek mental health counseling, or at least limit what sort of content she shares about your daughter?", "NTA for making the request, but unless you bring this matter to family court and get a ruling, you can't control what happens during her parenting time.", "NTA, your child does not have to ability to give her consent. Also it's hard enough as a girl to not get your self-esteem absolutely destroyed by social media--I can only imagine how she'd feel growing up and seeing her own mother doctors her photos.", "NTA.  At all.  It isn\u2019t just the photo editing I\u2019d worry about - although editing a child\u2019s picture to make them more \u201cattractive\u201d is very, very creepy.  But posting kids pictures at all invites a whole bunch of problems.  It is not safe.  Plus if your ex is willing to edit her child\u2019s appearance, what if she starts editing them so they look provocative?  She could have everyone from online predators to CPS to the police on her case.  Finally, your daughter is a human being. She is very young but still has autonomy over her body.  If your ex is using your daughter to exploit or burnish her own image that could be considered abusive.  When your daughter is older she may never forgive her mother.  Finally I would be concerned that your wife will raise your daughter to have the same insecurities and body image issues she has.  Not healthy.  If she won\u2019t stop immediately, I would take her to court.", "NTA. You should get a lawyer involved since there are contacts and brand deals involved.", "NTA. You said she has insecurities & she deals with them in her own way , but the message she\u2019s sending out by her editing your daughters photos is a negative one. Basically saying that she\u2019s not happy with her own child\u2019s appearance. When you\u2019re daughter is older & she feels like her own mother thinks that she\u2019s not pretty, it could cause her to have the same insecurities.", "NTA.\n\nI'm assuming if she's editing her 2 year old to an obvious degree it's only going to get worse as your poor daughter grows up and it's not going to take long for her to figure out the editing regardless... How the hell does she think it's going to feel when a young child realizes that they don't look \"good enough\" in their own mother's eyes to be posted unedited? That may not be the intention of her mother, as it seems she struggles quite a bit herself and I can't say it's actively malicious. However, this is insanely lacking in foresight and a basic understanding of how this will likely play out for your daughter's self esteem and mental health... I just cannot see a world in which this continues and it doesn't come at significant cost to your daughter's well-being. This isn't just about photos or general standards.. If it were unedited photos that IMO is somewhat more complex, but this editing of a toddler(!) is so, so likely to be *damaging*.\n\nThe posting pictures of her so much with such a following may be monetarily rewarding, but is it really worth that? Tbh I don't think for your ex this is even about supporting herself/daughter or at least I doubt that was the initial intent if this behavior was so prevalent already. Maybe ore like an added benefit (money) of what she was already doing (posting and editing). Or her trying to achieve her own dreams though your daughter. Or I don't know.. I wonder whether her mother knows herself in all seriousness.\n\nEncourage your daughter's mom to get help for herself. Encourage her to not pass on her own insecurities, pain, etc to her own child. Because if she's this consumed by how the world views her then it will seep into everyday life. Kids pick up on a lot even if they don't fully understand it at the time. I'm not trying to sound alarmist, I'm not saying either of you are bad people (as a whole, bc this is AH behavior from mom for sure), but this is unhealthy for your kid and you are absolutely right to be concerned.", "NAH. You have a right to be angry and she has a right to post her child if she so chooses. Tough spot, sounds like she needs some counseling. Wish you all the best", "i mean, you can tell her whatever you want, but you don't really have a leg to stand on since she's the child's mother. she doesn't have to listen to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is always wrong for adults to monetize their children or exploit them online in any way. I never posted any photos of my children on social media until they were adults and could consent. I feel very good about that decision and my daughters respect and appreciate it as well.  You definitely did the right thing by having the account removed and need to remain vigilant on that front.\n\nThere is a deeper issue here though that concerns me going forward.  It is damaging to a child to be told directly or indirectly (photo editing) that there is something wrong with them/their looks and that they need to be \u201cfixed\u201d. This stuff gets internalized and can cause great harm for many years to come.  \n\nPlease, for the sake of the child, find out as much as you can regarding the issue and how your daughter is treated.

Things did not work out with his ex who is very active on social media due to being a model and promo girl. She also does photography. Anyway, she posted a lot of their daughter on her Instagram. A couple years ago some weirdo took those pictures of the little girl and made a fake account of her. I do not recall the details of how this was found out but messages from the father to the account to delete them proved unsuccessful. Instagram was no help at all either. Several of us continued to report these pictures and the account to Instagram repeatedly. It took awhile to get this account removed.

I realize that as a culture we're only just starting to reckon with the whole \"momfluencer\" phenomenon and what it means for kids' entire childhoods to be documented for public consumption (and sweet brand deals) on social media, but I think it's all pretty fucked up if only from a consent standpoint.", "do you think it would do anything? i'd hope so, but it seems doubtful. what she's doing is gross for sure but i don't think it's illegal, is it?", "i fully agree that what she's doing is terrible, but he can't reasonably expect just telling her she's \"not allowed\" to do something to work. can a person stop a parent from choosing to post pictures of their own child on social media?", "I've never been, despite being a FLW fan.
