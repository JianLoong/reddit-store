The truth hurts. Your grandma weaponized a child's fear of being abandoned, a child who had already lost both their parents. What a horrible human being. She deserved everything you said to her, and more. \n\nI would definitely make it clear to your wife that this is off limits now, that you do not need that in your life. In my experience, blood doesn't mean family, and it sounds like you have nothing good to gain from that relationship.", "NTA, and thankfully your wife realises how badly your grandmother\u2019s parenting approach has affected you. Your grandmother still uses the orphanage threat, she hasn\u2019t earned your respect, the old woman is how she is by decisions she\u2019s made, and threats she\u2019s made.", "Nope. You don't take care of kids expecting them to be your old age plan. However, if she had been kind and loving, I am sure you would have gladly helped. She got what her actions warranted. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nShe is reaping what she has sown.", "NTA You were totally mistreated and nobody cared. I'm sorry for what you went through. I hope that you're getting therapy to deal with this because it's a huge trauma that started with your parents' loss and all the way to now. You deserved better.", "NTA. It sounds like nobody likes her and wants you to come back and take care of her.", "NTA you didn\u2019t abandon your grandmother you escaped your abuser.\n\nWhere was this family when they knew you were being abused as a child?\n\nThey\u2019re wanting you to care for her so they don\u2019t have to look after her.  Let them do it and live in peace without them and all they crap.", "Omg Nta I'm so sorry", "\"Dear Family,\n\nYou don't \"abandon\" the adult who abused you throughout your childhood; you *escape* them.  Perhaps you didn't see the evil that was done to me for all those years, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.  \n\nAdults who abuse children do not deserve the time or attention of those children when they grow up.  And those children deserve the sympathy and support of their extended families, not scorn for failing to embrace an abuser who has not only failed to apologize, but who continues to repeat the same cruel words she spoke even to a little orphaned child.\n\nIf I hear one more word of criticism or complaint in sympathy for my abuser I will block you.  I will be much better off without you, just as I'm better off without my abuser in my life.\n\nBehavior has consequences.  Child abuse is evil.\n\nBest, OP\"\n\nNTA.  You have no duty to your abuser.  Not even a little.  Not even a tiny little bit.", "100% NTA. So sorry you had a horrible childhood with that awful abusive woman- people often forget it doesn\u2019t have to be physical. Karma is a bitch and she\u2019s reaping what she sowed.", "NTA It's a shame. After losing her child and husband, your grandma had a chance to find happiness again by raising you with love. You could have had a great relationship. Instead she let bitterness and hatred fuel her heart. You did nothing wrong and you owe her nothing.", "NTA. What\u2019s the deal with these flying monkeys. She says she wished she put you in a orphanage. You agree with her and these guys get all upset.", "Very much NTA.  I\u2019m sorry you had such a crappy adult \u201draise\u201d you.", "NTA - You didn't need closure, you needed NC.  Go back to NC for they entire side of the family that are berating you for the way you were raised by this psychotic person.  You owe them nothing.  You need to get and keep that sort of evil out of your life.  Hopefully you can get past this and move forward happier and healthier.  Good luck.", "Very much not the asshole. I'm so sorry that was your childhood and I'm very sorry that it's found its way into your adulthood. But give yourself a minute and then repair those boundaries. You owe her nothing. Those saying so don't realize the abuse you endured or they are just as toxic. You deserved warmth and love. You deserve it now too. We NEVER owe our abusers anything. Never!!", "NTA. At 18 you were an adult so it wasn't running away.\n\nFamily is on your case because they want to make her your problem; note that she'd have received social security survivors benefits if you were in the US and if your parents didn't have wills you'd have inherited. You may have gotten life insurance if they had it. \n\nYou need to talk to an attorney whete your parents lived upon death and find out if they had wills and whst happened to your assets.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re an adult now and you do not owe her anything, especially because of the way she treated you.

That is a horrific thing to say to any child, much less a child in your situation!!
