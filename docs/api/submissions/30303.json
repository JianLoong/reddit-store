I was confused but shrugged it off.\n\nWe get to the game, he\u2019s not holding my hand like usual, no hand on the waist nothing. We go get some concessions and as we go to sit down his buddy pops up. My bf turns and hands me his food and drink. They hug and chat a bit. Mind you Im behind him holding his stuff looking like a right fool. No introduction nothing. I feel like Im back with my ex who never wanted to date me just didn\u2019t want anyone else to, which ik is my problem but that\u2019s how I felt. They end their interaction and he takes his things and we find a seat. \n\nHe talks to the older man next to him and I just think it\u2019s friendly chat since he\u2019s just like that.\nNext thing I know that same guy comes and sits next to us. Turns out the older man is his father which is why we sat at this spot.

We have had discussions about how football games would go, mostly him explaining what\u2019s going on. We only get one day a week to see each other usually.

He should deeply apologize.", "Going against the grain here and say NTA. There's a difference between needing constant attention, and your bf flat out ignoring you and not even introducing you, and when he does finally remember you exist and introduces you, he could as well have said \"and this is the hotdog I'm eating\". It really showed how insignificant your presence even was there.\n\nWhen you hang with a group, you hang with the entire group, that included you. This feels like he didn't want you there and didn't even communicate that with you, he sounds really immature. You are not obligated to stay where you are not wanted, and it's clear that you were not wanted here.", "NTA.\n\nBut I think the relationship has run its course and this is a good indication that your more into him than he is to you.

I don't know.\n\nHe was definitely rude to you in front of his friend, he should have explained why you were holding his things then introduced you as his girlfriend.  Talking to friend or friends dad and ignoring you was rude. He could have explained what was going on if you didn't understand.  \n\nI also understand the ex who only dated you because he didn't want anyone else to - a friends ex wouldn't let her dump him because he knew she was miserable.  If she dumped him, he had secrets (and proof) that would get her in trouble with her family (she was in HS then), hexwas friends with her friends and had them believing things that weren't true, and he'd gotten her the job she depended on to pay for her car.

I do get that in a mature and loving serious relationship that there is more of that going on.\n\nIt sounds like he was into being there, into the moments of experiencing his old high school.\n\nFrom your viewpoint, he didn't involve you enough.  You're overreaction of leaving without even talking to him could send vibes like that - you are not interested in him.  It's also very selfish.  The high school thing couldn't be more about him and his experience?\n\nSounds like a very unhealthy relationship if something SO SMALL bothers you THIS HUGE.  We need to \"give\" in relationships too...   Not just have it be all about attention on you - let him have moments too.  You won't always be the first introduced.  Sounds like he had his mind on all sorts of things that night, but he did actually remember you.\n\nIt was very immature for you to leave without words.  \n\nThat demands that his attention wonder where you are.  15 minutes is a very short time for him to notice you're not there...  You could have been in the bathroom, at the food stand, catching up with an old friend...  But he inquired.

Is this a new relationship? \n\nHow cool of him to invite his dad ( or you if he usually goes with his dad) and introduce you but you seem to have taken it as a slight. Could he have paid more attention to you? Maybe, but it is a sporting event and I suspect he was picking up on the vibes from you. \n\nI\u2019d encourage you to learn to be comfortable in your own skin, to be friendly-find a way to join in the conversations around you, let your BF have some space, relax and just enjoy doing something you don\u2019t usually do. I\u2019d also probably apologize for leaving and just explain how insecure you were feeling.

But nothing stopped you from introducing yourself or trying to be a part of the experience. \n\nIt is natural that if you go out with other people, his attention is going to be more on the other people than on you. There can be many reasons for it: \n1- pure maths. If there are 3 people you get 1/3 of the time if he spreads it evenly (which noone actually calculates during social activities:') ).\n2- if you live together or are otherwise often together, he probably sees his friends less than you.

If so, did he seat your hand away?", "No worries! I do understand. I was 24 (30 years ago). Sometimes it\u2019s just about assumptions & unrealistic expectations not being met. It\u2019s not going to help OP grow & learn by saying otherwise.\n\nWe all have to own our own reactions. Perhaps bf didn\u2019t behave magically. That\u2019s definitely a conversation to be had. \u201cDidn\u2019t love this, didn\u2019t enjoy that\u201d. But bf should get the opportunity to participate in the conversation & maybe apologize & suggest that this may not be something OP will ever enjoy.\n\nI don\u2019t believe bf meant to cause any harm.

Let\u2019s not do that again.", "Have they not seen each other for a while?\n\nActually it doesn't matter.

Can you tell me about what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m commercial lemon. Nice to meet you.\u201d\n\nMaybe when you lost you BF - you just could have met him back at the seats? Or text? Or anything other then pouting.", "Okay.  So what was the best play of the night? What did the others think of how the game was going?

And there is nothing wrong with either of those, but honestly, it just doesn't work out on the long run. You can talk and make him pay more attention to you, but it should be something rhat he WANTS to do, not to be forced to do... You will find someone as needy as you, who will adore the crap out of you :) dont put up with this", "Despite what people will tell you, 22 is still a time of figuring shit out. Same with 24.

Just don\u2019t go if you have no interest in watching the movie, the concert, the game. If football holds no interest \u2026 then don\u2019t do it. There\u2019s not much else going on during those events. Either you\u2019re choosing to get involved or you\u2019re sitting there bored as hell & judging others.\n\neta \u2014 no one forced OP to attend this event. It was a choice.

Just don\u2019t go again.", "yeah they have an interesting dynamic but hes pretty restricted. it sucks for both of us mostly him though ofc", "I mean, NTA, for sure. But communication is a two way street", "yeah with an attitude though. he asked if i was watching the game and i said \u201cim on my phone youre talking whatever\u201d", "This is definitely a realistic approach \n\nI saw in another comment that the game didn't go as expected, anyway for op, because she's never been to a game and doesn't know the rules, so her bf promised to walk her through what was going on as it happened, and didn't \n\nI agree with you;  they need to have a conversation about expectations", "yeah i understand that he sees his friends more often than he sees me. I shouldn\u2019t have stormed off I agree, I wasn\u2019t thinking rationally.", "i was the only one engaged in the game which was funny, the game was actually pretty good lots of 60+ yard touchdowns. It was hard to even try to engage in conversation bc of how we were seated and hes a big guy so i literally would\u2019ve had to stand up to be seen by his friend and the friends dad i also couldnt even hear", "Im very traditional and so is my bf in no circumstance would he not introduce me.

He sounds like an AH to me\n\nHe knew his gf was previously abused/neglected by her previous partner and likely has abandonment issues because of it\n\nIs that his problem?  No\n\nWould a text to say, hey, I saw xyz while taking a piss, be back in a few have solved that?  Probably \n\nInstead, he didn't even notice op was gone until op was in the car, already leaving the game \n\nHe sounds like a poor partner and op deserves better \n\nIt's not high maintenance to want some kind of acknowledgement of your existence, to be treated better than a servant, and to know that your partner cares enough to know that you even are there?\n\nThe fuck?", "I'm sorry, I don't understand this. How can his dad prevent him from going out and doing something? He's a grown man.", "Yeah sorry, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s clear communication.\n\nThis seems to be a communication bigger issue than just the game.", "was gonna go with NTA but reading this i think you might be a soft TA. he tried to check up when he noticed you acting different and instead of answering him honestly you snapped at him and then left. that's not healthy and avoidant as hell. that's on you, not him.", "That\u2019s an extremely childish way to respond. You may not be mature enough to be a relationship", "Then clearly you should have stayed to watch. You chose to go. Sometimes partners watch the game. And don\u2019t over analyze the social behaviour of their partner.  I guess in general this is a terrible boyfriend who usually treats you poorly- because if it was one night and you actually watched the game and enjoy the sport?  It makes no sense to leave.", "he lives with his dad and he threatens to kick him out often so he doesn\u2019t like to step on his toes", "yes I agree, we did have talks about these things before. I laid everything out on the table two weeks prior. I thought we were in a better place.", "We\u2019ve been having problems and these weekly dates were something I almost begged him to do, we would just lay in bed and sleep before I sat him down and explained how neglected I felt about two weeks ago. So it was a culmination of my past feelings and how small I felt then. I knew id make a scene or burst into tears (I cry when im angry) so I thought just leaving was the best choice. I honestly wish I stayed though but in a different section to watch the game it was entertaining.", "Sounds unhealthy", "Wow. You really try hard to make garbage boyfriends work. You have to stop that.  Get help. Get help. I\u2019m not blaming anyone.  You just need to pick better and leave sooner."]}
