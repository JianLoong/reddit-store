He should deeply apologize.", "Going against the grain here and say NTA. There's a difference between needing constant attention, and your bf flat out ignoring you and not even introducing you, and when he does finally remember you exist and introduces you, he could as well have said \"and this is the hotdog I'm eating\". It really showed how insignificant your presence even was there.\n\nWhen you hang with a group, you hang with the entire group, that included you. This feels like he didn't want you there and didn't even communicate that with you, he sounds really immature. You are not obligated to stay where you are not wanted, and it's clear that you were not wanted here.", "NTA.\n\nBut I think the relationship has run its course and this is a good indication that your more into him than he is to you.

I don't know.\n\nHe was definitely rude to you in front of his friend, he should have explained why you were holding his things then introduced you as his girlfriend.  Talking to friend or friends dad and ignoring you was rude. He could have explained what was going on if you didn't understand.  \n\nI also understand the ex who only dated you because he didn't want anyone else to - a friends ex wouldn't let her dump him because he knew she was miserable.  If she dumped him, he had secrets (and proof) that would get her in trouble with her family (she was in HS then), hexwas friends with her friends and had them believing things that weren't true, and he'd gotten her the job she depended on to pay for her car.

I do get that in a mature and loving serious relationship that there is more of that going on.\n\nIt sounds like he was into being there, into the moments of experiencing his old high school.\n\nFrom your viewpoint, he didn't involve you enough.  You're overreaction of leaving without even talking to him could send vibes like that - you are not interested in him.  It's also very selfish.  The high school thing couldn't be more about him and his experience?\n\nSounds like a very unhealthy relationship if something SO SMALL bothers you THIS HUGE.  We need to \"give\" in relationships too...   Not just have it be all about attention on you - let him have moments too.  You won't always be the first introduced.  Sounds like he had his mind on all sorts of things that night, but he did actually remember you.\n\nIt was very immature for you to leave without words.\n\nThat demands that his attention wonder where you are.  15 minutes is a very short time for him to notice you're not there...  You could have been in the bathroom, at the food stand, catching up with an old friend...  But he inquired.  If an hour had gone by or 30 minutes even, then it would seem that he wasn't concerned - but he did show concern/interest by wondering where you were at 15 minutes.\n\nI don't really think you meant to infer \"ok if I don't have your attention, fine then, I'm leaving...\"\n\nIf you could fill in the blanks to express honestly how you were feeling and what you WANT from him, it could help you identify insecurity and desire and eventually demand for inclusion and attention.\n\n\"I want you to include me.\"\n\n\"i want you to want me in your life so much that I matter more to you, enough that you are excited to introduce me to your dad...\"\n\n\"I want to be treated like someone deserving of a higher place, not just a drink holder...\"\n\n\\---   I'm picking up on the idea that you don't know him too well since you didn't know his dad.\n\nBe careful of jumping deeply into relationships and giving your heart away before you really know a person.", "Sorry OP, YTA for leaving but more so for just being incredibly high maintenance. Is this a new relationship? \n\nHow cool of him to invite his dad ( or you if he usually goes with his dad) and introduce you but you seem to have taken it as a slight. Could he have paid more attention to you? Maybe, but it is a sporting event and I suspect he was picking up on the vibes from you. \n\nI\u2019d encourage you to learn to be comfortable in your own skin, to be friendly-find a way to join in the conversations around you, let your BF have some space, relax and just enjoy doing something you don\u2019t usually do. I\u2019d also probably apologize for leaving and just explain how insecure you were feeling.

But nothing stopped you from introducing yourself or trying to be a part of the experience. \n\nIt is natural that if you go out with other people, his attention is going to be more on the other people than on you. There can be many reasons for it: \n1- pure maths. If there are 3 people you get 1/3 of the time if he spreads it evenly (which noone actually calculates during social activities:') ).\n2- if you live together or are otherwise often together, he probably sees his friends less than you.

It's just a coward thing. Plenty of women out there do the same.", "You need to love and respect yourself more. I don't know if you are going to therapy, but if you are not, I highly recommend you do.\n\nThe first thing I will tell you is that you are not oversensitive, you are not overreacting. You were on a date and he acted like he barely knew you. Where you went wrong was in tolerating any of his nonsense. The second he dump his stuff on you and gave his back to talk to his friend and not introduce you was the moment you should have told him wth! Then he should have apologized and that would be it. It he could tell you that you are wrong or whatever and you then would know he is an ah act accordingly. Also he could have apologized and continue doing the same in which case you bring th3 issue up and consider for how long you are going to tolerate it.\n\nInstead you wait for him to realize you exist and have rights, and you are a person with feelings. Sadly a ton of people are not nice enough for that. So you need to draw a line of what you want in a relationship. If the other person doesn't offer that, you know they are not for you. Everyone has different needs, and you have a right to your needs. And if this means you are not in a relationship for a while, no lose. It is better to be alone than in bad company. Being in a relationship doesn't make you better or worse. Focus in your happiness and peace of mind.\n\nHowever, I want to point this out. He is an ah. He is not acting that way because of you, he is acting that way because he is that way. Don't think this somehow is your fault. What someone does is their responsibility. You are probably just too patient and let things go for longer than you should, but if he treats you poorly that's on him. Not on you.\n\nNTA.", "<3\n\nI'll check them out, thanks for the tip!!", "So then interrupt it's not a big deal. One step to the side and wouldn't have to push anyone aside.

Some people are just like that. But you have to manage those feelings and still allow your prospective partner the space and opportunity to show you their effort. Acknowledge why you like this person, but remind yourself that they are just a person. \n\nI fall very hard and fast too. But I learned that instead of giving everything right away, it\u2019s much better to go slow and let my anticipation for the next steps remain in patience. Letting someone show their interest is very rewarding to me, and it makes me feel so much more secure than when I used to go balls to the wall and pray I\u2019d get the same back. That way, you know they\u2019re really worth it when that wall comes down and you give 100%. \n\nIt also helps with avoiding \u201clove-bombers\u201d who do everything too much in the first month or so of the relationship to compensate for their selfish/abusive tendencies that show later on.", "Gotcha. Just an outsiders opinion but the fact that there had to be a discussion as to what going to a football game would look like may have been a reason why it took so long for him to bring you to one. If you were trying to take interest in something he\u2019s interested in that\u2019s a nice gesture. But sitting down and discussing how it is going to go comes across a bit like putting your own terms on his hobby. Expecting him to explain everything that\u2019s going on is definitely going to take away from his experience. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re out of line wanting him to hold your hand or put his hand on your knee, but it\u2019s really not something to be upset over at a football game. Obviously he knew the expectations and still went and treated you like shit so he\u2019s the asshole but I think you\u2019re being a bit naive in how you expected this to go and it was kind of doomed from the start.", "I was arguing with someone about woodworking (I work with hardwood every day) and after I proved them wrong they dig through my posts and told me everyone knows my Asian noodles are soggy because I asked a Question about it in the cooking sub lol \n\nEdit: spelling", "If you take your gf to a football game and ignore her the whole time, you're a dick.
