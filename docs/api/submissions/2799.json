I have been using this service for quite a while and haven\u2019t had any issues until this past Friday. \r\n\r\nI scheduled my pickup time for 3pm-4pm so  I could either pick up the order before or after getting my son from school. I received  notification that my order was ready at 245pm so decided to pick up the order first. I arrived for pickup at 315pm and did the check in on the app letting them know I was there. \r\n\r\nImportant to note I was parked where I could see the door where the pickup orders come out and could see 3-4 employees standing around talking while 1 or 2 others were actively moving orders to vehicles. I waited until 347pm when I knew I had to leave ASAP to get my son or he would be waiting outside. I called the number for the pickup and was told, \u201cI see your order and it will be out in just a few minutes.\u201d So I figured I would be just a few minutes late to the school.\r\n\r\nI called again  to the pickup number at 4:03pm and they said I see your order but it\u2019s not ready yet! I didn\u2019t want to keep my son waiting indefinitely so I left to get him and called the store manager to let them know they were having issues in the pickup area and explained what had happened and let them know I would be back to pickup my order after getting my son from school. \r\n\r\nWhen I got back to Walmart I checked in again (it was 445pm as I had to stop for gas) I waited and waited some more until finally!!! A girl came to my window and I asked if I was Amanda? No, no I\u2019m not Amanda, I\u2019m not_my_problem_dude. She rolled her eyes and walked away. \r\n\r\nIt is now 530pm, so I decided to look up the corporate number for Walmart and was asked some questions by a nice gentleman who seemed genuinely shocked at what I told him. I told him that I had never had a bad experience before this day and I explained about what had happened when I called the pickup number and told him if they would\u2019ve just been honest and said it wasn\u2019t ready the first time I called I would\u2019ve left to get my son and came back and there wouldn\u2019t have been a problem but her telling me it would be just a few more minutes and keeping me waiting another 20 minutes and I still didn\u2019t get my order upset me. \r\n\r\nMy order was out to my car less than 10 minutes after I explained what was happening to the person at the corporate number. \r\n\r\nMy husband thinks I\u2019m the AH because I let the person at the corporate number know about the employees lingering in front of the door and that I felt like my order taking so long was intentional after seeing the girl roll her eyes at me. I don\u2019t think I am the AH because it\u2019s not unreasonable expect my order to be ready after receiving notifications stating it was ready and letting a company know when their employees are being rude to customers. \r\n\r\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1668950995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0461b/aita_for_calling_the_manager_and_the_corporate/", "score": 260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your nagging and attitude does not make anything better for them and they have tons of other customers just as salty as you waiting even long because of your behavior. This is stressful to work through and I probably would have been more rude to you.   The only reason why you got it in 10 mins after seeing the manager is because they brought it out to you early to avoid a corporate complaint.\n\nEdit: I am willing to bet those 3-4 people you thought were slacking off were probably on their well earned and legally protected break, or they were clocked out but still in uniform.

OGP, online grocery pickup employees are a completely separate department. I\u2019m 99% sure employees you saw \u201clingering\u201d were on breaks and not OGP employees. Those employees are on pretty tight leashes. Departments are very segregated and while it pisses customers off, not any blue vest can help with every need. Communication between corporate and management do not work the way you imagine so there zero chance your order was lost intentionally, because you complained about the eye roller.

I'd want to know if my employee rolled their eyes at a customer who had been waiting for three hours for something they were told was ready for them. That's rude as hell to do to anyone, especially someone who has done literally nothing wrong. It's not your fault you were told the order was ready when it clearly wasn't. Someone didn't want to get in trouble for being behind, so they marked the order as completed to get ahead, most likely. And that's their problem, not yours.\n\nMaking reports is never an asshole thing to do; complaining rudely is. It doesn't sound like you did that at all, and it doesn't sound like your complaint was unreasonable. No one had to mark your order as ready if it wasn't ready. That's on them, and they wasted hours of your time because of it. They made a gamble and they chose the wrong order to do it with. Too bad, so sad. But at the end of the day, Walmart is paying them for their time, and they aren't paying you for yours. In fact, YOU paid, for items, and also a service, and you were not receiving what you paid for. I'd have complained, too.", "INFO: why didn\u2019t you just get out the car and go ask them?", "NTA - I used the grocery pickup service at Walmart for over a year with mixed results. The service was declining and I was already considering going elsewhere when I received expired/rotten meat and poultry in my order. All of it was 2-3 days past the listed best before date (last day they can sell it in my area) but smelled like it was several weeks past that. \n\nThe second that grocery cart approached my car I could smell it. I refused to accept it but the worker argued with me. So I got out of my car and walked around to the back and again refused to accept it. Was told they'd have to take the entire order back. Told them that was fine. He turned and ran back inside with the empty cart. \n\nI'm a cane/walker/wheelchair user so I couldn't chase after him. It was several family/economy packages of chicken, stewing beef and ground beef (buying for my family, my Dad and throughout the pandemic I made dinners for elderly neighbours). Almost $100 of rotten food. I had a few days off and was planning to do some bulk cooking. I don't typically buy that much at a time even when ordering for 3 extra people.\n\nStore management refused to take it back, refused an automatic refund. Told me I'd have to bring it inside myself. It was peak pandemic in February so only so many could be let inside at a time. So I'd have to wait outside in line for 45 minutes, then inside for another 20-30 to return expired/rotten food left in my car during a grocery pickup? Tried to explain that I'm disabled and how difficult that would be for me. If I could do that I wouldn't need grocery pickup in the first place.\n\nIt was a weekday afternoon so I attempted to reach corporate. They gave me a run around as well. I sent in pictures of the front of the packages showing the expiration dates and how revolting the meat/poultry looked, and they still refused to reimburse me for it. So I left the meat at the front of my parking stall and decided never to shop at Walmart again. A week or so later I received a form letter and reimbursement for less than the meat was worth. Haven't shopped at Walmart since.", "NTA. You received really poor customer service, and each level that you escalated to did not solve the problem.", "NTA. My dad and I have called corporate on our local Walmart all the time. Our Walmart is absolute garbage due to store management being terrible.

He had reserved a sedan for a 4 hour drive to visit customers and when he arrived early in the morning for his car they brought out a van.  Uncomfortable, unprofessional appearance for taking a customer to lunch, and more gas money.  He complained and they said they also provided cars to the dealership next door for repair customers.  They'd taken all the sedans.\n\nOH did the Seinfeld argument about how he had a reservation and you don't just TAKE the reservation but you are supposed to HOLD the reservation vehicle.  They were baffled.  He had to explain that this meant that when you have a sedan reserved you don't give it to the rando from the dealership, you give them the van.  Still baffled.\n\nHe ended up calling corporate and complaining.  From then on when the attendant brought up his reservation on the computer there'd be a wide-eyed look.  He figured there was a note on his account, \"This Bast-rd calls corporate\".\n\nAnd he always got his reserved car after that.", "It might be that they are short staffed. The other workers may be on break, or the people picking the items may be behind. I once had to wait an hour and a half for my order.

It\u2019s equally likely Walmart isn\u2019t fully staffed or corporate won\u2019t allow the store to be fully staffed.

The pic they sent me when I got the order was clearly angled to make it where I couldn\u2019t see that they had literally just tossed my groceries at my door. I\u2019d bought some pots and pans, and they were basically thrown against my door. My eggs were cracked and laying open. It was awful. I called the line and was like \u201chey, my stuff was just thrown at my door and some of my stuff was damaged.\u201d I was mad, but calm on the phone; no cussing or yelling.

Since then I haven\u2019t had an issue.", "So it\u2019s not just me either I sat waiting one day for 2.5 hrs and nothing - call the number it\u2019s not ready and - pullout to go do something/another errand while waiting for the order to be ready and before I\u2019m out of the parking lot I get a text saying the canceled my order \ud83d\ude12 glad to know it\u2019s not just me having issues with them \n\nAlso NTA", "My Mom had a situation where Walmart said they delivered something that she never received and they had already charged her.

The execution of online and pickup orders literally EVERYWHERE blows in my experience, not just Walmart.", "I was honestly shocked at how long I waited because this is far from the norm at my Walmart, usually the wait is less than 10 minutes from the time I check in and the time I pull out of the parking spot. They have been doing a fantastic job up until this happened and I kind of feel like I\u2019m the AH because I know it\u2019s not how things are normally at my pickup location. But on the other hand I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m the AH because it was an excessively long wait time. Thirty minutes would have been ok but waiting 45 minutes twice was where it got to be too much for me to just let it go. I would have probably been waiting even longer had I not called the corporate number the second time I went to pick up my order.", "I think they should have a policy that clearly outlines where employees are allowed to be while on break. When I was a manager in the service industry I would make sure all new hires knew where the break room was and enforce the rule \u201cOff the clock, off the floor\u201d to avoid any customer complaints for employees who were not on the clock and therefore not helping them.

I was just trying to be friendly and explain and ask about what was going on.  I was trying to be empathetic and was all like, \u201cy\u2019all got a busy day with all the orders huh?\u201d And the guy was just like \u201cno.\u201d  He also told me \u201cit\u2019s better for you to go home and only come back after you\u2019ve been notified it was ready.\u201d After he walked away I asked the customer service guy if he heard that and repeated it for him and he just seemed like he was shocked.  I mean if I worked there and me and my coworkers weren\u2019t busy and were just being lazy, if a customer said that I\u2019d at least be polite enough to lie to make them feel better\u2026", "I mean yeah it does but surely it\u2019s better than sitting there for 45 minutes doing nothing. And you don\u2019t have to go in the store, you said they\u2019re right there where you can see them so just walk up and ask. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong to be pissed at the bad service but I do think you could\u2019ve dealt with it differently.", "[removed]", "That\u2019s why I said I would call too. I just have a problem with people saying the workers must have been lazy or whatever. It\u2019s very likely this isn\u2019t the case, and the store is short staffed and with the holidays makes it worse because there are more orders and larger orders.", "If they wanted to discourage the use of these services, they would start charging for them, not torpedo the customer experience that would cause them to lose customers entirely.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
