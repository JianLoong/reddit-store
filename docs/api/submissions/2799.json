I have been using this service for quite a while and haven\u2019t had any issues until this past Friday. \r\n\r\nI scheduled my pickup time for 3pm-4pm so  I could either pick up the order before or after getting my son from school. I received  notification that my order was ready at 245pm so decided to pick up the order first. I arrived for pickup at 315pm and did the check in on the app letting them know I was there. \r\n\r\nImportant to note I was parked where I could see the door where the pickup orders come out and could see 3-4 employees standing around talking while 1 or 2 others were actively moving orders to vehicles. I waited until 347pm when I knew I had to leave ASAP to get my son or he would be waiting outside. I called the number for the pickup and was told, \u201cI see your order and it will be out in just a few minutes.\u201d So I figured I would be just a few minutes late to the school.\r\n\r\nI called again  to the pickup number at 4:03pm and they said I see your order but it\u2019s not ready yet! I didn\u2019t want to keep my son waiting indefinitely so I left to get him and called the store manager to let them know they were having issues in the pickup area and explained what had happened and let them know I would be back to pickup my order after getting my son from school. \r\n\r\nWhen I got back to Walmart I checked in again (it was 445pm as I had to stop for gas) I waited and waited some more until finally!!! A girl came to my window and I asked if I was Amanda? No, no I\u2019m not Amanda, I\u2019m not_my_problem_dude. She rolled her eyes and walked away. \r\n\r\nIt is now 530pm, so I decided to look up the corporate number for Walmart and was asked some questions by a nice gentleman who seemed genuinely shocked at what I told him. I told him that I had never had a bad experience before this day and I explained about what had happened when I called the pickup number and told him if they would\u2019ve just been honest and said it wasn\u2019t ready the first time I called I would\u2019ve left to get my son and came back and there wouldn\u2019t have been a problem but her telling me it would be just a few more minutes and keeping me waiting another 20 minutes and I still didn\u2019t get my order upset me. \r\n\r\nMy order was out to my car less than 10 minutes after I explained what was happening to the person at the corporate number. \r\n\r\nMy husband thinks I\u2019m the AH because I let the person at the corporate number know about the employees lingering in front of the door and that I felt like my order taking so long was intentional after seeing the girl roll her eyes at me. I don\u2019t think I am the AH because it\u2019s not unreasonable expect my order to be ready after receiving notifications stating it was ready and letting a company know when their employees are being rude to customers. \r\n\r\nSo Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1668950995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z0461b/aita_for_calling_the_manager_and_the_corporate/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also let them know about the employees just hanging out by the door and that one employee had rolled her eyes at me and that I felt as though my order was intentionally being skipped as revenge for the call to the manager. My husband says I\u2019m the AH because there are still staffing shortages and I shouldn\u2019t assume they were just hanging out by the door and calling the corporate number could cause someone to lose their job. I disagree and feel that the employees should have all been working to get the orders out and not standing around by the door while only a couple of them ran orders to vehicles.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why some people just refuse to do their fucking jobs is beyond me. The whole purpose of a pickup time slot is for both sides to be prepared for your arrival. You were absolutely within your rights to call the corporate office about this.", "NTA. The behavior you described was unprofessional, and managers at the corporate office should know. You waited nearly three hours after they told you the order was ready. Rolling eyes is disrespectful and unacceptable, and I would want to know if one of my employees was doing it if I owned a business. You were fair and honest when you said this is the first time you had a problem.", "NTA. I\u2019ve had more issues with Walmart pick up and delivery than I\u2019d consider reasonable. Just recently I had to call their professional help line 3 times because we tried the delivery service and our order was 2 and a half hours late and left on a neighbours porch. Letting people know you\u2019ve had issues with the service is the only way they\u2019ll know to improve:", "NTA.  That was terrible customer service, and you did what was necessary to get your order.  I would have been incensed.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not sure I would take my order being slow or delayed personally, if you have enough time in the car to sit and find the corporate number, call it, and actually talk to a human\u2026.something is up. Your husband is wrong to call you an asshole for corporate, especially since it seems you weren\u2019t cussing people out, demanding that someone gets fired, or whining about getting a discount.", "Hell No! NTA \nI do a lot of third-party deliveries DoorDash, Uber-eats, Roadie. I've waited at one location an hour to get the food another. At another location I waited 4 hours (fortunately I got a good nap in). They had a good idea of this bring food to your car concept but the execution is terrible.", "NTA! \n\nI had an issue with a pick up at Nordstrom and I was not going to take it. When I got the survey, I went into detail about what happened and I got a response from corporate. They apparently had a good talk with the employees about how badly they dropped the ball.", "NTA they tell you if the order is running behind. If they sent you a notification saying it was ready, it should have just been sitting there. They were actively ignoring you. How long were you supposed to take it? You did far better than me, and used a lot of patience.", "I now boycott Walmart for the same thing.  No one to help and always told they're short staffed.  Then don't offer the service!  NTA", "NTA. The pick up times are chosen for a reason, they should be prepared for you. When I order a pick up at target or whatever store, I even wait until I get the email saying it's ready. And even then it sometimes takes forever for them to bring you your things.", "YTA \nif there were other orders going out the entire time and yours hadn't yet, it's probably because they were rushed. Your nagging and attitude does not make anything better for them and they have tons of other customers just as salty as you waiting even long because of your behavior. This is stressful to work through and I probably would have been more rude to you.   The only reason why you got it in 10 mins after seeing the manager is because they brought it out to you early to avoid a corporate complaint.\n\nEdit: I am willing to bet those 3-4 people you thought were slacking off were probably on their well earned and legally protected break, or they were clocked out but still in uniform. This is a common misconception among folks who think customer service workers are servants.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I complained too, but nothing happened,  didn't get my groceries.  Maybe with enough complaints they can take a look at whatever scheduling/ order picking software they have controlling their employees. I won't hold my breath", "NTA easy for your husband to think you\u2019re being irrational when he wasn\u2019t the one picking up groceries, picking up your son, and waiting repeatedly.", "NTA! I was once getting an item at a Walmart near me and did package pickup (indoors) and the young ladies were so unfriendly. I had just come from DMV to get my hubs license renewed and he had hurt his leg; so I helped him. \n\nI told the \u201chow we do\u201d email that the workers in DMV were nicer than the pickup people who didn\u2019t say one word to me. Needless to say the managers called me back and assured me that they would be speaking to them and doing retraining.", "NTA.\nThis is business as usual at WM and Sam's Club.", "NTA\nNot even a little bit \n\nYou were more than patient, especially given that *they had already told you your order was ready* \nYou didn't flip out at someone, you didn't get mad that there was a little wait if (say) too many folks went on break just as a rush happened... You waited. And waited. And waited.\n\nThey had every opportunity to pause and figure out where the mixup was, and they didn't do that.\nFeedback like that matters when there's a problem that needs addressing. Either someone's acting sh*tty, or there's a snag that means problems can happen without being apparent, and either way, the BUSINESS needs to know and be able to address it.", "NTA, this is typical type of stuff from my local Walmart grocery pick up", "NTA.  I would have done the same thing.", "Nta if everything you\u2019ve described is as it seemed but it\u2019s hard to judge situations like this. Like there were times when I worked retail I would get off at the same time as a few other people and we would stand outside and talk for a few minutes, a customer even came up and yelled at us once. Or sometimes someone\u2019s position at the store isn\u2019t what you want them to be doing- like maybe those were cart attendants? \nI\u2019m trying to be the devils advocate here because I know the world is short staffed and I have worked in a lot of similar positions just trying to get by so I try to have an open mind. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not allowed to make a stink when people are truly rude or inconsiderate of you.", "NTA for complaining BUT as a former Wally employee, I\u2019d like to correct a misunderstanding you have. OGP, online grocery pickup employees are a completely separate department. I\u2019m 99% sure employees you saw \u201clingering\u201d were on breaks and not OGP employees. Those employees are on pretty tight leashes. Departments are very segregated and while it pisses customers off, not any blue vest can help with every need. Communication between corporate and management do not work the way you imagine so there zero chance your order was lost intentionally, because you complained about the eye roller. Shit rolls downhill hard at Wally\u2019s, but it takes time.  By kicking it up the corporate chain, rest assured, asses will feel it, but incompetence doesn\u2019t mean it was intentional.", "I work for the carrot logo shopping company and I am timed on my speeds shopping and staging orders. The runner is timed for how long it takes to scan an order out and hand it off to the customer. I keep a cart dedicated to the runner in my staging area because it takes so long to get a cart, come back in to the store, then walk down to my staging area only to turn around and go right back the way you came and then, walk down the front of the store outside my staging area and around the side of the building to deliver the groceries to the customer's car. \n\nI even have to help store management at times when they get stuck helping customers with their orders.", "Also those numbers are published for this exact reason.  If they don\u2019t want to work then don\u2019t have a job!", "My local Walmart has done really well with delivery and pickup until recently. Don\u2019t know what changed but I hope it\u2019s just a one off experience and they don\u2019t continue to have issues.", "Right.\n\nhusband is an AH.\nHe probably would have been marching into the store had they made him wait 15 minutes.", "They suggested I speak to the store GM and request a refund and I told them that it wasn\u2019t necessary, I just wanted to get what I paid for and move on but also told him that I hope this wouldn\u2019t become the new normal for their pickup area.", "My husband said I should\u2019ve just cancelled the order and gone into the store. I disagreed, mostly because I wasn\u2019t planning on being out so wasn\u2019t dressed appropriately for shopping and didn\u2019t want to end up on the people of Walmart page (if it\u2019s still a thing) as I was wearing an old shirt with holes (super comfy and refuse to throw out) and sweatpants (that are 2 sizes too large, again comfy!) with my fuzzy slippers! Dressed for quick errand run, not for interaction with other sentient beings!", "You know what else doesn't make things better? Repeatedly lying to people. If they told the truth from the beginning that it wasn't ready, everything would have been fine.", "We had a policy of \u201coff the clock off the floor\u201d when I worked in retail for this very reason. And had you read the entire post you would have seen that I waited 45 minutes the first time I attempted to pick up my order at 315pm and then waited 45 minutes more before calling the second time I went to pick up my order at 445pm Would you consider that to be a reasonable wait time for an order that was \u201cready\u201d at 245pm?", "I completely understand that. And you had every right to expect the service you signed up for.  Complaining about bad service is not wrong. I don\u2019t know why, as a society, we\u2019ve gotten to where it is considered rude to expect the service we pay for. I work in service and I\u2019m never upset with someone complaining unless they\u2019re unnecessarily ugly. You didn\u2019t berate the workers or curse at them. You reasonably asked that the service you were promised and paid for be carried out in a more efficient manner. You waited patiently twice and only complained when you had tried to address them directly and it didn\u2019t work. You did nothing wrong.", "That doesn't sound like lying and more like an issue with the point of sale service and the app.", "Imagine there are 100 orders that day (an incredibly low estimate) if everyone showed up 30 mins after their order is ready, the cascading effect of getting those orders out is going to compound into longer wait times down the line.", "I was told the order was ready and would be out in a few minutes at 347pm and then told it wasn\u2019t ready at 403pm so someone gave me bad information. I\u2019m just glad it wasn\u2019t too cold outside since my son was waiting for me to pick him up from his after school club meeting."]}
