It's a reflex resulting from the past trauma. I also drive a motorcycle and I can understand your perspective. It certainly puts us in a unbalanced state, like facing something that we aren't prepared of, when someone squeezes suddenly. I suggest you help her get over her fear of roads first. Try taking a cab or use public transport until she's comfortable and explain to her patiently why you're doing this. See if you can put a down payment for a car with a good build if you can afford one.", "NAH. Explain to her your concerns about this issue, highlighting the possible risks from this. Trauma isn't a competition. You also went through something traumatic and have some lasting impact from your accident. You might need to consider a different form of transportation going forward.", "Nta, nothing wrong with calmly explaining that it\u2019s very distracting. She probably doesn\u2019t even realize she\u2019s doing it, just don\u2019t expect it to completely stop as she\u2019s still very traumatized and scared", "OP, you are doing a great job of supporting your gf. I hope you can gently talk about this. The context should be about how you are both still recovering. Describe your concern when she squeezes. Acknowledge that you both have triggers. You are afraid you will make a wrong move and put you both in danger. Come up with strategies you both agree on. And, express your love as much as you can. You seem like a kind soul. Good luck, and I\u2019m so sorry that you both are going through this.", "No you wouldn't be, you're just looking out for both of your safety, like you said, you were going to calmly explain to her about the dangers of squeezing you.", "Nta but she probably can't help it. It might be better to discuss and agree on another way she can signal danger to you. That way you know there's no need to panic if she squeezes you and the still a way for her to earn you.", "NTA It's a difficult one because of the trauma both of u experienced the most u can do is calmly explain ur concerns the squeezing while also allowing her to explain why she does it and reach a compromise", "NAH but I really question your decision to travel by motorbike.\n\nPerhaps this is your only mode of transport you have. But motorcycles, for people travelling as passengers, can feel really unsafe. And that's not even taking into consideration the traumatic experience your girlfriend has been through. I imagine her sitting behind you on a motorcycle is an especially unnerving experience.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with you asking your girlfriend to stop squeezing you when you go out for rides as long as you do it in a calm and sensitive way - making sure you explain how it can fluster you - but again, if you feel easily flustered on a motorcycle, I question your decision to travel by one.", "NTA. But it is a Reflex she cant control, it is not her choice. \n\nI would advise you to not use the motocycle for transportation anymore before this is sorted out via seeing a health professional.", "Definitely NAH. Safety on a bike is very important.  That said, I really don't think she's going to be able to stop.  She needs therapy and time.", "Maybe get her a koosh ball to squeeze and see if that helps?

Or upgrade to something tuk tuk style so she feels just a little less exposed?", "NTA, but I'll doubt she'll stop. It's an instinctive reaction. My wife is afraid of driving for no particular reason unlike your girlfriend and despite knowing this and talking about it hundreds of times over the last few years, she can't stop herself from jumping on imaginative breaks on the front seat while I'm driving 20 km/h in the city.", "Call me crazy, but maybe just find an alternative mode of transportation? I was in a really bad car accident and the things it's affecting even years later still surprises me. I understand your frustrations as well, so I propose an easy compromise of either getting a car or taking public transportation. She probably doesn't even realize she's doing it, and if it's a subconscious thing that can be very tricky and take a long azz time to sort through. NTA but I don't see you fixing this quickly if at all with just therapy.", "NTA, you're just asking for safety and to focus without being distracted or unbalanced, as long as you won't shout it at her, just explain it to her kindly, also maybe you could lay out on riding a motorcycle and choose another safer means of transport", "NTA. That said, she is clearly affected by the memory of that accident and uncontrollably squeezing you. Perhaps you should find another way of transport for a short while for safety for both of your ?", "NTA. I agree with what everyone else have been saying about telling her gently, and also that she probably isn't aware that she's doing it.\nI think she needs some exposure of some sort to feel safer in traffic. First step is just making her aware of what she does I think, so when it happens again she can realise it and stop herself and self sooth! There's growth in that!\nAnd idk how Vietnam are when it comes to roads, but is there any chance she/you bogh could use regular bikes to get around so she is in control? Or take the bus more often or walk? OR an electric bike?\nJust some immediate suggestions.\nBut definitely tell her, and say that you feel like an asshole for saying anything, because you know she is badly traumatized but that you want her to know so you can keep ensuring that she's safe!", "Just buy a car dude, if it puts your gf at ease.", "I don't think you would be.\n\nI think you should be honest. It's the motorbike version of backseat drive and it is potentially very dangerous.\n\nLike someone else said, after an accident, being on a bike is possibly NOT the best form of transport at this point. If there is in fact a different option, she should try that until she feels a bit better being on the road.\n\nIf not, you do need to explain why, that the only concern is safety - having had a passenger on a bike, it just takes one movement to throw you off, one split-second movement to throw you off completely. Might not be a severe injury physically, but severe enough mentally.", "Yta- don\u2019t take a person who barely started walking onto a motorcycle.", "YTA for still riding a motorcycle after almost getting your self and your partner killed, I get that they a good economic choice but they are honestly an inevitable accident with minimal protection waiting to happen. it doesn\u2019t matter how diligent you are someone is bound to not notice you and move through you, every friend and family member I\u2019ve had that rides has had this happen to them and now I can\u2019t talk to some of them ever again. If you really absolutely can\u2019t get the car, stick to the buses and conceal a sharp knife for protection, otherwise you probably won\u2019t survive the next accident and that\u2019s why she squeezes you so tightly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not guaranteed that she will be able to stop herself after a conversation you have with her though. \n\n It sounds like an automatic nervous system response. The body tenses up when it senses a threat, and she is highly likely to be suffering from PTSD so she might not be able to help it. Once she realises a reaction she is having is potentially causing more of a safety issue, she may become more fearful of getting on the motorcycle altogether and her anxiety might get worse. There's a lot of shame in PTSD sufferers for the weird things their minds and bodies do. \n\nIt will take therapeutic work for you both to heal, but I'm hearing that talk therapy isn't viable rn. Have you looked in Somantic Experiencing treatment? It was designed to reprogram the brain when it has experienced shock trauma (like road accidents) and you can either do the work with a therapist, or get a grasp of the concepts from the audiobook Healing Trauma by Peter A Levine, which has many guided visualisation exercises. You can help your partner as she listens to this, by offering your presence and therefore a feeling of safety.", "Definitely NTA if you can bring it up in a constructive considerate way. I can totally understand where you are coming from. My mum is a terrible passenger. I told her she makes me nervous when I drive as she keeps flinching if I\u2019m doing something she wouldn\u2019t. She has managed to stop. She still puts her foot on a imaginary break but I have learned to ignore that and we do laugh about it. I have been driving for over 20 years \ud83d\ude02.", "NTA. Maybe ask her to look down instead since it could startle you unnecessarily.", "You wouldn't be an asshole just talk to her nicely about it and don't bring it up out of the blue. My girlfriend is emotional as hell and I've learned to tread lightly to not make her feel like it's her fault or that I'm mad about it.\nIs there anything on the bike she could hold onto with her hands to squeeze, instead of squeezing you with her legs such as a sissy bar or something. It's probably involuntary so it would be hard to train it out of her with anything other than more experience riding around people again to build her confidence.", "NAH\n\nI understand your pov, I understand hers. It sucks that you don't have a lot of options for transportation.", "Her squeezing you is most likely an unconscious reflex. She may not even realize she is doing it. Have a discussion asking her if she knows she\u2019s doing it and why she\u2019s doing it. Do not be confrontational or angry. Explain what you are thinking and feeling when she does this. Once she knows how it is affecting you hopefully she will work on not doing it.", "A sidecar", "NTA\n\nYou need to have this conversation with her sooner rather than later. This could cause another accident.", "NTA.\n\nHaving been in a bike crash and had a long term, difficult recovery, my advice is to go easy on her and be patient with her.  It takes a long time to get over the psychological bs that gets caused from something like that.  Sit and have a chat to her about things you can both do that will make rides less stressful.  Good luck!", "\"should I communicate with my girlfriend?\"\n\nWtf are these AITA posts recently?", "NTA if you ask her, but be kind and understanding that she might need more time? I'm a pillion myself on the back of my partner's motorbike and we've had 2 incidents (last one was 3 years ago and we didnt get seriously hurt) while on the bike but it still makes me jumpy now. My partner has multiple times told me to relax because he can feel it when I tense and it makes him tense, which I fully understand and I don't call him an AH for it, so perhaps your gf will also understand where you're coming from. \n\nHave you spoken to her to ask about the squeezing? Because my partner mentions it but for me, when I squeeze his thighs with mine, it's not because I'm nervous or tense but because I'm not holding on to him with my hands so I need to use my thighs to hold on. However, we are able to communicate while on the bike so I'm usually able to verbally tell him when something makes me uncomfortable. Do you have intercom in your helmets? Perhaps that could be something to look into as well? If it's also thinking about safety, are you both safely kitted up? I know it's expensive and it's not common in SEA (I'm from SEA too) but it could help her feel more comfortable if riding the bike is both your main form of transportation.", "Ywnbta", "Show her some fitting scenes from _Keeping Up Appearances,_ and explain to her that Hyacinth\u2019s constant _\u201cRichard!

She likely cannot help herself from squeezing when she feels anxiety. After such a bad accident, such anxiety would be completely understandable. Of course, you need to talk to her about it because now it's affecting you both. I'm sure you'll approach it gently and kindly and with respect for her fear and trauma. She may not be aware of what she's doing, and even if she is aware, she might not be aware of how it affects your driving.

Maybe i could just ask her to squeeze the whole time? So its not a shock or a jolt when she does.", "That's probably the best way to go. But even squeezing all the time the reflex could still be there but it's definitely worth a shot.", "You might get used to it faster, but squeezing takes strength. So she might be unable to maintain it for the whole ride. Maybe she will be tired enough to stop squeezing after a while.", "Our apartment is very central.

Even with no injury at all, a year after I still had the same reflex of pure scare and holding my seat when my parents drove a little bit too close to the car in front of us. So given her circumstances I can totally understand why she has those reflexes.   \nI think it's something you can discuss with her while being very reassuring. You would not be an AH having this conversation if that's why you're afraid of, given the fact those reflexes can be dangerous to both of you.", "YWBTA I broke my femur in an accident and for quite some time after I had an unshakable fear that would activate at the slightest hint of danger. It is a trauma induced phobia and she can not control it. It will have to go away on its own through exposure, maybe therapy would help. But patience is needed and it will take a long time. She has learned a new instinctive response just like you have an instinctive response to think something is wrong when she squeezes you. Her learning to stop is the same as you learning to stop thinking it means something bad", "NAH here. She's traumatised and this is an expected reaction. It's also a dangerous reaction as it distracts you.\n\nWhere the fault lies is that a motorbike is not suibable transport for her. That's it. Not going to say Y T A because your current form of transport is a motorbike, but it is not safe for her and you will need to move to another form of transport or she will need alternative transport arrangements.\n\nI could also suggest maybe a sidecar for the motorbike, but that may not actually alieviate her anxiety.", "Personally, I'm in the YTA \\ YWBTA group.  I ride a motorcycle and have had folks on the back.  If *you* are reacting to just her squeezing on you then I'm inclined to think you maybe don't have your head on a swivel enough.  You need to get your nerves settled, it's your responsibility as the driver to see the whole big picture so that your backpack can focus on their responsibility.  It is her responsibility to hang on tight and not hinder your ability to move so that you can safely drive.\n\nIt takes a lot of seat time to get over accidents mentally, so I would recommend taking the time to go on smaller roads as much as possible to get used to it more.", "No she just needs to hold you to the point where she won't fall off not fucking squeeze you like your a fucking stress ball", "nta, it's a hazard to do so, and as the driver, you do have a right to ask her to stop", "One of the few NAH we see here.

You're both dealing with trauma from an accident and your location and economic status means most of reddit's default solutions like therapy and \"buy something that makes this better\" aren't available to you. \n\nThe best case outcome imo would be to have a conversation with her where you first lay down that you know this is something she doesn't have much control over and isn't at fault for. Then explain the potential hazards of her squeezing you and ask if there's any way you can help her feel safer on the bike so she doesn't have to squeeze you and distract you as often. You can't really do much more than that. \n\nHope things'll get better for you either way.", "NAH\n\nYou can't tell her to stifle her trauma, and you need to be able to steer without being off balance.", "Only discuss the issue you have with it. Don't tell her to do anything.\n\nShe can't help the trauma and her reactions are probably involuntary. \n\nMy MIL had a trauma event and to this day, 60 years later, any little surprise or startle will have her screaming like a banshee. It doesn't matter where or when. It doesn't matter what reaction it garners.", "NAH . But you must handle it with compassion  and love. Explain that you know how scared she is after the wreck and her ordeal, and what she is doing. Tell her that it is the same as screaming while riding in a car. If you are calm and honest, she should understand and try to stop. \n\nHowever. If it's a possibility... perhaps switch to a car for a while? I get that may not be doable, but she may feel more secure . Be sure to ask her what she needs to be more confident, as never riding in a vehicle is not an option but living in fear is not a way to live", "NTA \n\nIt's a safety issue but maybe put the bike in the garage for a while.", "NTA you can ask but she probably can\u2019t control it. She is scared.", "NAH\nClearly both her reactions to being in those situations and your worries about those squeezes are reasonable, and talking about it is the best thing to do.\n\nI'd also suggest agreeing on a signal for her to give you when the IS an emergency that she knows you're not aware of. Even something as simple as three taps on the shoulder. It likely won't help with her squeezing if it's involuntary, but it might be helpful to you to know that those squeezes are just a squeeze and not \"the signal\".", "NTA but how you bring this up will be important.  She can\u2019t be adding to your danger in an attempt to emotionally minimize her feelings of danger.", "NTA calm and reasonable discussions solve many of life\u2019s problems", "NAH  \nYou are such a decent person OP. I suggest you should come up with a different warning system for when something is actually a matter of emergency/urgency. Then you could just assume that the squeezes are not a cause for concern. It will take some getting used to though. Speaking as someone who gets startled easily, you might still react to the squeeze. But knowing there is another warning signal will help you to mellow down your reaction to the squeezes until you no longer react to them. Hope that helps.", "I would say dont try that.

Sometimes it might be reflexive but sometimes it might be for comfort. Still, you can absolutely train a reflex.

Eventually I got over it and stopped but at that time, I genuinely could not have stopped doing it because I didn't realize I'd done it right away.", "NAH, its alright to talk about it.

We had a car accident because someone drove into our car. Everytime we were in a similar situation I would hit my feet into the floor as hard as possible. It was because I was scared of another accident. My body was reacting without me wanting it and the only way I could get rid of that feeling of exploding from the inside out of fear was by hitting my feet into the floor.

Like by all means mention it to her and say hey if it's something you can control please try not to because it unbalances me which might be dangerous and it makes me think you've seen a threat. If she can't though could you maybe come up with an alternative signal if she actually spots something dangerous you might not have seen?
