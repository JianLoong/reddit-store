You sound controlling AF. Her family is still family and important to her and you\u2019ve failed to list any real reason why that\u2019s a problem with you. Your problem was before you were married, and frankly you weren\u2019t family when you weren\u2019t being prioritizing as such, so boo hoo. Get over it.", "YTA. She wanted to hang it for one night. You are completely overreacting. It doesn't make your painting less special. She is allowed to have sentimental attachment to multiple things.", "YTA\n\nFor one night? \n\nA lot of people have complicated relationships with their family. You're allowed to love them even if they're awful.\n\nFor one night, at least.", "YTA. You\u2019re blowing this so much out of proportion that clearly it\u2019s not about paintings but about you having unresolved issues with your wife\u2019s family/sister. Seems like you need to go back to therapy so you can sort out why you feel threatened by your sister in law.", "YTA. You're furious over less than 24 hours of having different ARTWORK.\n\nYou're even mad that your sil even made artwork for your kids.", "YTA\n\nIf it's not about you OP then it's automatically not okay.  This needs to be cross posted into a narcissist group. You're mad that her sister did  custom paintings for your kids?? That just automatically means you wife prioritizes her sister over you??\n\nOof... And this is just what you wrote from your view.  I can only imagine what your wife would actually write .", "YTA. Once you give a gift to someone it is no longer yours.

You sound very controlling.", "YTA.\n\nI understand that it feels like the past is being dug up, but you are taking this the wrong way.

Maybe I'm missing something here but that sounds rather controlling...", "YTA - she was planning on hanging it for a single night. One single night. Your reaction was over the top.\n\nAlso, who the hell has a problem with Calvin and Hobbes?", ">My wife claims that she \u201cjust wanted to remember her young years for a night\u201d and that she was planning on putting the drawing in our sons room in the morning am our painting back up on the wall\n\nI understand that you guys have a history with her prioritizing her siblings in a detrimental way and you might be vigilant, but it sounds like she's just being sentimental here. If this was the straw that broke the camels back, there's a bigger conversation worth having. But she did say she would move it. It seems like you're being unfair.", "You yelled at her about a painting? And you have to ASK if YTA??", "I didn't even read it but yelling for whatever reason is an asshole thing to do.

Everything in your life is yours and you control all of it and YTA", "YTA you sound like a self absorbed narcissist. You keep changing your story to not liking the family then it just being the sister. Also it doesn\u2019t seem like your poor wife puts her family above you. She can love her family still. Not wanting to be there when she spends time with her own family is a tell tell sign that your the issue. This is how abusers slowly start isolating their victims", "What I\u2019m gathering here, is that her family sees right through your bs and sees you as what you are, controlling and manipulate. So they don\u2019t like you, and because of that you now don\u2019t want your wife associating with them.

You bought it to hang there, she didn\u2019t really have a say in it.

This is home decor, and why couldn't both painting's be hung?  OR even matter all that much?  Do you really put that much emotional value on objects?  Or do you just simply always need to be the center of her life?  In a more sane moment maybe, consider your stating in this post that you are jealous of a painting.", "It's her painting, she can throw it away and you still have no right to say anything.", "YTA based on the post and an even bigger one based on your replies to other comments.", "YTA. This is not a situation where yelling at your wife is appropriate. Look at the big picture here... It's only a painting and in this case seems temporary... chill man. (But also surely your room is large enough to handle 2 paintings long term if need be?)", "YTA fir getting \"furious\" but given the circumstances, I'd be upset too. Back to therapy for both of you.", "YTA\n\nYou sound very controlling. Why does she need your approval to hang anything anywhere?   It's clearly not about the painting.", "YTA for being controlling, trying to isolate your wife from her family and shouting at her for \u2018daring\u2019 to put up a painting in her own home.", "You are wildly over reacting and she will now associate this fight with your picture. Every time she looks at it she'll remember how you flipped out when she hung a family members art in her own home. The picture is not longer sentimental, YTA", "YTA. The common problem in all of this is you, not her family, is she even allowed to see her family? Or do you try to control that as well?", "Idk\u2026 there\u2019s much more to the story with the way you reacted. So it\u2019s kind of hard for me to decide whether you are the AH. Idk why she would hang the painting on your bedroom wall when she could\u2019ve  just hung it up where she intended to put it. Sounds like she purposely did it to get a reaction but idk. Good luck.", "If you actually yelled at her, ESH, you are worse. Can\u2019t be coming at every situation with so much emotion, it won\u2019t help anyone and will make things escalate further. \n\nAlso it may be good for you to understand that not everyone holds the same sentimental value you do. She may not care nearly as much about the painting as you, and it would be rude of you to force her to do so. \n\nHowever, I do find it incredibly weird that she wanted to hang it up \u201cfor one night\u201d but also wanted to \u201ctreat the kids the same.\u201d That seems bizarre and makes no sense. Who hangs a picture for a night only to move it immediately after?", "The Iranian yoghurt is not the issue here.

This reaction is wild over one single night", "YTA, i feel incredibly sorry for your kids. I hope your narcissism doesn\u2019t infect them.", "YTA - she put up the picture for one night! One night!!! There\u2019s nothing wrong with that - it doesn\u2019t mean your marriage is ending, it doesn\u2019t mean she loves her sister more then you, it doesn\u2019t mean anything apart from she wanted to hang a picture of Calvin and Hobbes in her bedroom FOR ONE NIGHT! Stop being so insecure - it\u2019s just a picture and you are reading too much into it! \n\nAlso - why are you injecting to her hanging the picture in the 2.5 yr old room - do you know how fortunate the could is to have an aunt who loves him so much she did him a picture. YTA", "If I had you as a husband I would for sure choose the people who I was literally birthed around before you.

YTA.", "I\u2019m sorry but you need help. You seem to think your reaction to this is normal but it isn\u2019t. There might be some old pain or trauma in play here but your reaction is completely out of proportion to the minor thing that happened here. If you can\u2019t see that you really need a professional to help you with this.", "YTA. You made a scene for her switching it for the night. And also, what\u2019s with your issue with the kids having a paint made by their aunts? I bet there is much more to the story that you avoided mentioning. Makes me wonder how many red flags there were when you were dating that made her sister dislike you.", "Oh yeah, Y absolutely TA here. This is a terrible reaction to something, even you admitted, she\u2019s loved and held dear since she was a teenager. The fact that you just decided to be petty and say \u201cher sisters basic drawing\u201d when it\u2019s obviously something she loves and it\u2019s for one of your kids?

You sound so controlling. This is not about pairings or whatever. You guys need to figure out the \u201clong story\u201d part. \n\nFor this post alone, YTA. Calm down man. Find your words and a calm way to approach this. You are her husband but her family is her family. Don\u2019t make her pick.", "YTA. You are totally overreacting, and tbh I worry about your wife. She seems to be a good woman who doesn't deserve to be with such a controlling AH of a husband. \n\nIt is a painting. It is not your relationship, even though if she finally sees the light and throws you out I won't blame her. \n\nLet me remind you that your wife didn't spontaneously spawned in the world. She comes from a family and has the right to keep having a relationship with them if that's what she wants, and accepting gifts from her family if she sees it fit. You, on the other hand, have absolutely no right to forbid her to interact with her family, her memories and any and all gifts she receives, either from family or whoever. \n\nYou claim that it is a lack of communication. Have you ever discussed with your wife about which place you are going to put a picture you like? Have you ever asked her for her input on any decisions you make? Your behavior points to no. And besides, such trivial things shouldn't even be a topic of discussion. \n\nI hope your wife sees this red flag for what it is and wakes up. \nAnd just for good measure, YTA YTA YTA", "YTA and controlling af apparently yeesh", "YTA PFFFFFFT seriously? You can't handle a painting being moved for a night? What are you afraid is going to happen if it gets moved? Also, you voiced your disapproval of a painting done by your sil for your child? Why? You seem to really feel threatened by your sil's artwork.", "YTA she wanted to hang up the painting for a single night. If this is how you react then I feel bad for your wife. I also feel like she doesn\u2019t actually \u201cpicking her family over you\u201d. You\u2019re just extremely self absorbed and can\u2019t stand he attention not being focused on you. No wonder you guys are in therapy, you\u2019re a control desk trying to isolate her from her family.", "YTA and you need some therapy for these issues you have. She is allowed to have a relationship with her family. She didn't do anything wrong. It was ONE NIGHT and you are throwing a toddler tantrum over it. Stop it. Get some help.", "YTA for yelling at your wife. The rest of the words are useless. I think you should leave her.", "It's giving 'the Iranian yoghurt is not the issue'\n\nSeriously though, my partner switches up the art in our house all the time and it's never made me freak out or question our relationship. So maybe think about why this sent you into such a tailspin.", "Overreacting would be taking the painting you bought her and throwing in the trash and then having you family paint a bunch of stuff and hang it all over the house. But I'm petty and go over board to make a point. \nYTA While you wife absolutely favors her family over you, this painting isn't the hill to die on. After expressing your annoyance, you should've just packed up the painting you bought her and put it away. If she actually likes it, she'll ask about it, if not it'll tell you that she doesn't like it. Also you two need to talk about boundaries and personal space. I think you issues are deeper than home decor, but it is a symptom you can treat by talking.", "ESH.\n\n  She has a pass of putting  you last, so yes this hurt because she did it again. This is more than the painting and it sad  that people cant see that.  It   is you , yet again being number 2 in her life and her family nr 1.\n\nWhen it is such important picture,  you talk to your spouse before removing it , because that what adults do .\n\nAnd if she is allowed to change decor so are you, so just hang the painting back.\n\nAnd trust me if  gender was reversed in this, no one would scream  yta.", "No, NTA. It's something you bought, but not for HER, but for the two of you together. An anniversary gift. Especially combined with the fact that there has been therapy where she places her family above her spouse, you have every right to be upset about this. Your wife should not have inserted your sister into your bedroom without discussing this with you. \n\nThere is no way to know if she did this 'for one night', but I'm guessing she wanted it to be permanent.", "NTA. Your wife is a liar and definitely tried it. Had you not said anything, that picture would still be hung up in place of the other one.", "NTA\nYour room is a space for the both of you. Even for one night, taking something that is sentimental and relative to your relationship in your shared space can feel violating. The drawing could have been propped up in her view for the night or she could look at in the baby\u2019s room where it was intended. Or anywhere else. Disregarding your feeling of being overshadowed by her family is being visually displayed. So, it\u2019s completely valid that you have these strong feelings about it. Even if only for the night. It\u2019s jarring for you and inconsiderate on her end.", "ESH-your wife knows what this means to you and chose to swap it out \u2018just for one night\u2019 and gave a lame excuse on top of that.  You felt this was like the old days and it triggered you, causing you to overreact and act out.  You both need to talk these things out, why did she feel it was ok to do this and why did you feel the need to get so upset about it?  Maybe she could have asked first and maybe you could have been more understanding\u2026either way it shows you have a long way to go in counseling\u2026I wish you luck.", "NTA.  From the other painting, it sounds like there\u2019s already issues you guys need to talk out.  I\u2019d be angry too, if she took a painting down that was symbolic to the relationship for a painting that someone in her family gave her.  She could\u2019ve waited for the next day to hang it in son\u2019s room, and not have it in your room at all\u2026", "Can you Show the pictures, please.?", "Esh, how I read this, you are living in a 2 bedroom house and the 10 month old is sleeping in the parents bedroom for now.  The wife was putting the new painting up in their room where the 10 month old is currently.  To do this she took down a piece of art that was special to the husband.  Without showing him or asking how the OP felt about it.\n\nShe could have hung the new painting in the other bedroom with the other painting.  The 10 month old would be moving into that room with his brother eventually.\n\nI think SIL for whatever reason gets under the husbands skin.  So, whenever he perceives her getting put ahead of him, the reaction is bigger just because it is the SIL.\n\nAnd, before anyone steps out and says its her house and she can decorate it as she wants.  Does the same hold true if he takes all of the knick knacks off the mantle.  Then puts up a 76\" flat screen and a big obnoxious lazyboy recliner chair to watch the game on?

This is such a long story. It I will try to be brief and clear and get to the point. \n\nMy wife of 5 years is a huge fan of Calvin and Hobbes.

It\u2019s one night my guy, then it\u2019s going in the baby\u2019s room just like the one the older child has.

I want to add that, because counselors aren\u2019t always trained in spotting narcissistic behaviors, sometimes counseling is just another way for abusers to control their victims. If a counselor thinks they\u2019re dealing with a normal couple, they will suggest ways to improve the hurtful behaviors that the victim is being accused of and the abuser is given extra reinforcement that their victim\u2019s behavior is \u201cwrong\u201d and needs to be fixed.", "Yes, you\u2018re overreacting.", "I don't believe it was for one night only. You called her out, and that's the story she's spinning. Still, you shouldn't be shouting and she should have spoken to you first, being ot is so sentimental. You're both assholes.", "I don't believe it was supposed to be for 24 hours. She said that because you blew up. Also why for 24 hours? What is the purpose of that?

And a sad one at that", "OP, what is really going on here? Is this really because she didn't seek your prior permission to move one painting temporarily?

Does she feel the same way about it? What is the picture of?", "YTA it was one night. Also the painting you bought wasn\u2019t a gift for her it was for you. If she isn\u2019t able to take it down for even one night it was never a gift for her.  If you give someone a gift they get to choose how it\u2019s used. Most importantly it was ONE night and you chose to yell at her over the painting. Over a painting dude. You yelled at your wife someone you should love over a painting. Think about that. Ignore all the issues you have with her family. Is that how you should be treating someone you supposedly love?", "YTA for saying 31 is \u2018later in life\u2019.\n\nNot even joking, you seem to put a lot of pressure on yourself and others for things that are mostly in your head.", "I think you are more invested in this relationship than she is.", "Yta and 31/36 is not later in life that's normal.", "ESH\n\nI think you definitely are overreacting and should really try to understand that different people value different things in different amounts. And it turns out that she clearly values her family a great deal, you need understand that, and that you cannot change it, no matter how much you don't like it. If you love her you need to accept this and let it go. it doesn't make you, or your relationship, or your painting any less special.\n\nHowever, I do think she was also a bit inconsiderate. if it's true you've had years of counseling as a couple, I think she could've also realized that this probably meant a lot for you too and could've taken your feelings a bit more into consideration. Like talking about it beforehand to gauge your opinion or try to express how much it means for her, or she could've also chosen a different spot to hang it without having to replace where yours was.\n\nEither way, you both seem like you need to be more understanding of each other and willing to make ends meet. Good luck", "Putting aside the whole painting in your room thing for a minute- why do you disapprove of the sister's art in your 2.5 yo kid's room?\n\nNow going back to the painting in your room - Jesus christ you yelled at her over decorations? Do you not have any other wall in the house you could hang that picture on? I'm sure the sister's art would have moved to the ten month old baby's room eventually (and you would have disapproved then I'm sure). But you went straight to nuclear mode.\n\nIt sounds like you have a me vs. them mentality about her family, and that's a fight you're going to lose. Good luck. YTA\n\nETA - Jesus these comments. Have y'all never gotten something new that made you feel good or sentimental that you just kept somewhere you could easily see it for a day or two before moving it to a permanent spot?

(Even though this is the reason we are here.)\n\n>a lot of issues in the past because she . . . would alway prioritize her family . . . instead of our relationship.\n\nYou said in another comment that she goes to see her family, but you do not go with her. It sounds like you don't want to deal with the family that you married into, and are expecting her to only spend time with you. You claimed that you encourage her to see them, but that sentiment does not mesh with you saying that she puts them first, especially since it does not sound like you participate in this facet of marriage. They are your family now too, and you have been too inconsistent in the comments regarding which family members you don't get along with to give you the benefit of the doubt here.\n\n>I bough her a special . . . painting . . . It\u2019s special because it is symbolic of each of us waiting for the time/place that we found each other\n\nThis is why I need INFO, does she see the painting as sentimental as you do? Or did you give it to her and explain the sentimentality to her, and she agreed? Art is rough about this, preferences vary and gifting someone art puts them in a very difficult place if they don't like it as much as you do. Especially when it is your spouse, and triply so when you are expecting this to be in your private bedroom as a symbol. Whose idea was it to hang it there? Who brought it up first?\n\nI'd ask you to imagine it was a piece of jewelry with your initials in a heart on it, and then you expected her to wear it every day because it is sentimental. Now imagine from her perspective if she didn't think it was, but was trying not to let you down after the effort you put in, so she wears it even though she thinks it is tacky or ugly because she cared for the intention even if not the gift. I think that sort of problem should have been aired soon after the gift, but not everyone wants to tell their spouse they don't like a gift, so they will put up with it for their sake.\n\n>My wife had a previous Calvin and Hobbes painting that her sister did and it hangs in our 2.5 year olds room (despite me voicing my disapproval)\n\nINFO: Why do you disapprove of a single painting in your sons room? What specifically is the problem with a painting from his aunt on the wall?

She only wants this painting on the wall in your room to look at for one night, then the painting you bought her is going back in the place it already occupies.

Out of all the possible places to hang this piece, she took down a special sentimental piece?\n\nOne night, versus every other night that your painting has been there.

But that\u2019s just it. YOU have no connection to it. For your partner, there\u2019s maybe a lot of sentimental value in the piece her sister has created. For starters\u2026 her sister created it.
