This is such a long story. It I will try to be brief and clear and get to the point. \n\nMy wife of 5 years is a huge fan of Calvin and Hobbes. She has been since she was a teenager (she\u2019s 43 now)\n\nShe and I have had a lot of issues in the past because she (in the past before marriage while we were dating) would alway prioritize her family (siblings and parents) instead of our relationship. \n\nFast forward a lot of counseling, time, and miles and here we are\n\nFor our anniversary, I bough her a special one of a kind, original painting (it\u2019s 1/1) that we keep hung in our bedroom. It\u2019s special because it is symbolic of each of us waiting for the time/place that we found each other (we found each other later in life; 36 and 31)\n\nFast forward to tonight. I walk upstairs and I see that our painting is laying on one of our dressers and hung in its  place, is one of her sisters paintings. \n\nShe apparently painted this piece recently so that it could hang in the bedroom our our 10-month old. A little bit of context \u2014 we have two kids a 2.5 yr old and a 10 month old. My wife had a previous Calvin and Hobbes painting that her sister did and it hangs in our 2.5 year olds room (despite me voicing my disapproval)\n\nAfter confronting my wife, she said that she wanted to treat the boys the same so her sister painted another pic for our youngest son. \n\nAITA for being mad that she took down our painting to display her sisters?\n\nMy wife claims that she \u201cjust wanted to remember her young years for a night\u201d and that she was planning on putting the drawing in our sons room in the morning am our painting back up on the wall\n\nI am furious and told here that again she is picking her family over me. Out of all the possible places to hang this piece, she took down a special sentimental piece? WTF?\n\nAm i over reacting?\n\nEdit: we are both female\nEdit 2: adding this information based on some feedback in the comment section\n\n\nSome one asked me why I didn\u2019t get along with her family (or something along those lines) this is what I responded:\n\n\nShe has so many other paintings her sister has made for her or gifted her scattered throughout the house (including our bedroom) it was just this particular location that was kinda our our little\n\"altar\" and it felt special to me too (because of the verbal feedback she'd given in the past)\n\nTo answer your question, I don't get along with her family because they are fundamentalist Christians and being a lesbian is a problem for them. They consistently hurt her and tell her they love her but can't condone the behavior or some other nonsense. I have examples for days but for the sake of brevity, I'll stop there\n\nAnd, I've said this before but I am the one who doesn't want a relationship with them, she and our kids can if she wants to and if she wants her family to have a relationship with the kids\n\nEdit3: thank you all for the feedback! It was super AH of me to yell. I don\u2019t have the time to read all of y\u2019all\u2019s responses but know that I appreciate all of them. Some of them even made me lol\n\nI shared this post/responses with my wife. We talked and we\u2019re good\u2026lots of stuff to work through but we had a good honest long conversation. \n\nAlso thank you to all of you who sent DMs. Very appreciative of your time and words.

You sound controlling AF. Her family is still family and important to her and you\u2019ve failed to list any real reason why that\u2019s a problem with you. Your problem was before you were married, and frankly you weren\u2019t family when you weren\u2019t being prioritizing as such, so boo hoo. Get over it.", "YTA. She wanted to hang it for one night.

You\u2019re blowing this so much out of proportion that clearly it\u2019s not about paintings but about you having unresolved issues with your wife\u2019s family/sister.

You two need to keep working on your relationship and unresolved feelings about her family, since apparently your wife has no intention of cutting them off.", "YTA.

This needs to be cross posted into a narcissist group. You're mad that her sister did  custom paintings for your kids??

I can only imagine what your wife would actually write .", "[deleted]", "YTA, have you guys been in counseling because you try to cut her off from her family and she sees this as the obvious red flag that it is?

You sound very controlling.", "YTA.\n\nI understand that it feels like the past is being dug up, but you are taking this the wrong way.

Maybe I'm missing something here but that sounds rather controlling...", "YTA - she was planning on hanging it for a single night. One single night.

If this was the straw that broke the camels back, there's a bigger conversation worth having. But she did say she would move it. It seems like you're being unfair.", "You yelled at her about a painting? And you have to ASK if YTA??", "I didn't even read it but yelling for whatever reason is an asshole thing to do.

Everything in your life is yours and you control all of it and YTA", "YTA you sound like a self absorbed narcissist. You keep changing your story to not liking the family then it just being the sister. Also it doesn\u2019t seem like your poor wife puts her family above you. She can love her family still. Not wanting to be there when she spends time with her own family is a tell tell sign that your the issue. This is how abusers slowly start isolating their victims", "What I\u2019m gathering here, is that her family sees right through your bs and sees you as what you are, controlling and manipulate.

This is home decor, and why couldn't both painting's be hung?  OR even matter all that much?  Do you really put that much emotional value on objects?  Or do you just simply always need to be the center of her life?

This is not a situation where yelling at your wife is appropriate. Look at the big picture here... It's only a painting and in this case seems temporary... chill man.

Every time she looks at it she'll remember how you flipped out when she hung a family members art in her own home. The picture is not longer sentimental, YTA", "YTA. The common problem in all of this is you, not her family, is she even allowed to see her family? Or do you try to control that as well?", "Idk\u2026 there\u2019s much more to the story with the way you reacted. So it\u2019s kind of hard for me to decide whether you are the AH. Idk why she would hang the painting on your bedroom wall when she could\u2019ve  just hung it up where she intended to put it. Sounds like she purposely did it to get a reaction but idk. Good luck.", "If you actually yelled at her, ESH, you are worse. Can\u2019t be coming at every situation with so much emotion, it won\u2019t help anyone and will make things escalate further. \n\nAlso it may be good for you to understand that not everyone holds the same sentimental value you do. She may not care nearly as much about the painting as you, and it would be rude of you to force her to do so. \n\nHowever, I do find it incredibly weird that she wanted to hang it up \u201cfor one night\u201d but also wanted to \u201ctreat the kids the same.\u201d That seems bizarre and makes no sense.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with that - it doesn\u2019t mean your marriage is ending, it doesn\u2019t mean she loves her sister more then you, it doesn\u2019t mean anything apart from she wanted to hang a picture of Calvin and Hobbes in her bedroom FOR ONE NIGHT! Stop being so insecure - it\u2019s just a picture and you are reading too much into it! \n\nAlso - why are you injecting to her hanging the picture in the 2.5 yr old room - do you know how fortunate the could is to have an aunt who loves him so much she did him a picture. YTA", "If I had you as a husband I would for sure choose the people who I was literally birthed around before you.

She seems to be a good woman who doesn't deserve to be with such a controlling AH of a husband. \n\nIt is a painting. It is not your relationship, even though if she finally sees the light and throws you out I won't blame her. \n\nLet me remind you that your wife didn't spontaneously spawned in the world. She comes from a family and has the right to keep having a relationship with them if that's what she wants, and accepting gifts from her family if she sees it fit. You, on the other hand, have absolutely no right to forbid her to interact with her family, her memories and any and all gifts she receives, either from family or whoever. \n\nYou claim that it is a lack of communication. Have you ever discussed with your wife about which place you are going to put a picture you like? Have you ever asked her for her input on any decisions you make? Your behavior points to no. And besides, such trivial things shouldn't even be a topic of discussion. \n\nI hope your wife sees this red flag for what it is and wakes up. \nAnd just for good measure, YTA YTA YTA", "YTA and controlling af apparently yeesh", "YTA PFFFFFFT seriously? You can't handle a painting being moved for a night? What are you afraid is going to happen if it gets moved? Also, you voiced your disapproval of a painting done by your sil for your child? Why?

I also feel like she doesn\u2019t actually \u201cpicking her family over you\u201d. You\u2019re just extremely self absorbed and can\u2019t stand he attention not being focused on you.

I think you should leave her.", "It's giving 'the Iranian yoghurt is not the issue'\n\nSeriously though, my partner switches up the art in our house all the time and it's never made me freak out or question our relationship. So maybe think about why this sent you into such a tailspin.", "Overreacting would be taking the painting you bought her and throwing in the trash and then having you family paint a bunch of stuff and hang it all over the house. But I'm petty and go over board to make a point. \nYTA While you wife absolutely favors her family over you, this painting isn't the hill to die on. After expressing your annoyance, you should've just packed up the painting you bought her and put it away. If she actually likes it, she'll ask about it, if not it'll tell you that she doesn't like it. Also you two need to talk about boundaries and personal space. I think you issues are deeper than home decor, but it is a symptom you can treat by talking.", "ESH.\n\n  She has a pass of putting  you last, so yes this hurt because she did it again.

It's something you bought, but not for HER, but for the two of you together. An anniversary gift. Especially combined with the fact that there has been therapy where she places her family above her spouse, you have every right to be upset about this. Your wife should not have inserted your sister into your bedroom without discussing this with you. \n\nThere is no way to know if she did this 'for one night', but I'm guessing she wanted it to be permanent.", "NTA. Your wife is a liar and definitely tried it. Had you not said anything, that picture would still be hung up in place of the other one.", "NTA\nYour room is a space for the both of you. Even for one night, taking something that is sentimental and relative to your relationship in your shared space can feel violating. The drawing could have been propped up in her view for the night or she could look at in the baby\u2019s room where it was intended. Or anywhere else. Disregarding your feeling of being overshadowed by her family is being visually displayed. So, it\u2019s completely valid that you have these strong feelings about it. Even if only for the night. It\u2019s jarring for you and inconsiderate on her end.", "ESH-your wife knows what this means to you and chose to swap it out \u2018just for one night\u2019 and gave a lame excuse on top of that.  You felt this was like the old days and it triggered you, causing you to overreact and act out.  You both need to talk these things out, why did she feel it was ok to do this and why did you feel the need to get so upset about it?  Maybe she could have asked first and maybe you could have been more understanding\u2026either way it shows you have a long way to go in counseling\u2026I wish you luck.", "NTA.  From the other painting, it sounds like there\u2019s already issues you guys need to talk out.  I\u2019d be angry too, if she took a painting down that was symbolic to the relationship for a painting that someone in her family gave her.

The wife was putting the new painting up in their room where the 10 month old is currently.  To do this she took down a piece of art that was special to the husband.  Without showing him or asking how the OP felt about it.\n\nShe could have hung the new painting in the other bedroom with the other painting.  The 10 month old would be moving into that room with his brother eventually.\n\nI think SIL for whatever reason gets under the husbands skin.  So, whenever he perceives her getting put ahead of him, the reaction is bigger just because it is the SIL.\n\nAnd, before anyone steps out and says its her house and she can decorate it as she wants.  Does the same hold true if he takes all of the knick knacks off the mantle.  Then puts up a 76\" flat screen and a big obnoxious lazyboy recliner chair to watch the game on?

I want to add that, because counselors aren\u2019t always trained in spotting narcissistic behaviors, sometimes counseling is just another way for abusers to control their victims. If a counselor thinks they\u2019re dealing with a normal couple, they will suggest ways to improve the hurtful behaviors that the victim is being accused of and the abuser is given extra reinforcement that their victim\u2019s behavior is \u201cwrong\u201d and needs to be fixed.", "Yes, you\u2018re overreacting.", "I don't believe it was for one night only.

And a sad one at that", "OP, what is really going on here? Is this really because she didn't seek your prior permission to move one painting temporarily?

If she isn\u2019t able to take it down for even one night it was never a gift for her.  If you give someone a gift they get to choose how it\u2019s used. Most importantly it was ONE night and you chose to yell at her over the painting. Over a painting dude. You yelled at your wife someone you should love over a painting. Think about that. Ignore all the issues you have with her family. Is that how you should be treating someone you supposedly love?", "YTA for saying 31 is \u2018later in life\u2019.\n\nNot even joking, you seem to put a lot of pressure on yourself and others for things that are mostly in your head.", "I think you are more invested in this relationship than she is.", "Yta and 31/36 is not later in life that's normal.", "ESH\n\nI think you definitely are overreacting and should really try to understand that different people value different things in different amounts. And it turns out that she clearly values her family a great deal, you need understand that, and that you cannot change it, no matter how much you don't like it. If you love her you need to accept this and let it go. it doesn't make you, or your relationship, or your painting any less special.\n\nHowever, I do think she was also a bit inconsiderate. if it's true you've had years of counseling as a couple, I think she could've also realized that this probably meant a lot for you too and could've taken your feelings a bit more into consideration.

The OP did not provide that they were female at the time of my post, and they also did not provide in the OP or any comment that the reason the family did not like them is because they are homophobic. They also stated in a comment previously that the family is nice to their wife, but does not like the OP. I don't like how late this info is being provided, or how it continues to change a story that has been slowly changing.\n\nThe OP might have just been upset and missing crucial details, but considering how hard this is turning on its head I am now concerned this is either not factual, the edit is not true and only trying to garner sympathy, or it is deliberate trolling to catch people out on an issue that changes moral dynamics after the edit.\n\nTo summarize: I'm not sure if I can keep the YTA rating without thinking more about this, but the OP left out very important context to the fight they had and only provided it hours later. In another comment they have said they wanted to get judgement without bringing orientation into the equation, but using a throwaway would have been a better option. The key information is this: The OP does not get along with their wife's family *because* the family is fundamentalist and does not approve of their relationship.\n\nWithout that information the OP only shows a person who does not like their wife's family for some unknown reason, and freaks out about a painting from one of them going into the place of the \"sentimental\" one. This is massively important to the argument, and does change context, but not because of their gender alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor now the rest of the comment will stay up, and I'll reserve my vote since I am now uncertain of the OP in general after so much information has changed that was not originally provided, and can no longer make a good judgement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINFO: I have a lot of questions so I'll try to limit, there are more in the comment. Is this painting sentimental to her, or just to you? Whose idea was it to hang it in the bedroom? Who first called it sentimental?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts been covered by others but you really need to go over this story with your therapist, not with Reddit. (Even though this is the reason we are here.)\n\n>a lot of issues in the past because she . . . would alway prioritize her family . . . instead of our relationship.\n\nYou said in another comment that she goes to see her family, but you do not go with her. It sounds like you don't want to deal with the family that you married into, and are expecting her to only spend time with you. You claimed that you encourage her to see them, but that sentiment does not mesh with you saying that she puts them first, especially since it does not sound like you participate in this facet of marriage. They are your family now too, and you have been too inconsistent in the comments regarding which family members you don't get along with to give you the benefit of the doubt here.\n\n>I bough her a special . . . painting . . . It\u2019s special because it is symbolic of each of us waiting for the time/place that we found each other\n\nThis is why I need INFO, does she see the painting as sentimental as you do? Or did you give it to her and explain the sentimentality to her, and she agreed? Art is rough about this, preferences vary and gifting someone art puts them in a very difficult place if they don't like it as much as you do. Especially when it is your spouse, and triply so when you are expecting this to be in your private bedroom as a symbol. Whose idea was it to hang it there? Who brought it up first?\n\nI'd ask you to imagine it was a piece of jewelry with your initials in a heart on it, and then you expected her to wear it every day because it is sentimental. Now imagine from her perspective if she didn't think it was, but was trying not to let you down after the effort you put in, so she wears it even though she thinks it is tacky or ugly because she cared for the intention even if not the gift. I think that sort of problem should have been aired soon after the gift, but not everyone wants to tell their spouse they don't like a gift, so they will put up with it for their sake.\n\n>My wife had a previous Calvin and Hobbes painting that her sister did and it hangs in our 2.5 year olds room (despite me voicing my disapproval)\n\nINFO: Why do you disapprove of a single painting in your sons room? What specifically is the problem with a painting from his aunt on the wall? It sounds like this older piece is sentimental to her, and because it isn't sentimental to you, you do not want it.\n\n>she was planning on putting the drawing in our sons room in the morning am our painting back up on the wall\n\nYou say that she puts her family first. She only wants this painting on the wall in your room to look at for one night, then the painting you bought her is going back in the place it already occupies. It sounds to me like she is putting you first 99.99% of the time here, as her sisters painting was only going to be there for a single night, and then be moved.\n\n>I am furious and told here that again she is picking her family over me. Out of all the possible places to hang this piece, she took down a special sentimental piece?\n\nOne night, versus every other night that your painting has been there. Why is a painting from her sister, your sons aunt, such a problem?\n\n>Am i over reacting?\n\nYes.\n\n>AITA for yelling at my wife\n\n~~Yes. YTA.~~ See the edit up top. Too much information has changed on this and I will now choose not to vote. The reason for the family not liking OP was extremely crucial and not provided in the OP, despite being the source of the friction that started the argument in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd some extra from your comments:\n\n>It\u2019s that she gets to make decisions big or small without consulting me but my every move is questioned.\n\nYou are questioning a small move, and told us this is not the first time.

I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with you being controlling but having your feelings hurt as I think mine would have been too. The fact that she prioritizes her family (that disrespects your relationship) over you all the time is a big red flag in your relationship. It\u2019s funny how people would most likely say it\u2019s wrong of her to prioritize her family over you if it was a heterosexual relationship but because you both are lesbians it\u2019s OK for them to disrespect your relationship.", "NTA.

But re-decorating with reminders of my partner\u2019s family\u2019s disapproval???)\n\nShould you have yelled? Probably not. But if this kind of family stuff has been happening since the beginning of the relationship, I can understand how you got to that point. We don\u2019t get a good idea of what your wife\u2019s thoughts are, and we don\u2019t know exactly what kind of treatment you and your wife have received from the fundamentalist Christian family, hard to gauge, but I\u2019m going with ESH.\n\nIt\u2019s not about home decor.

Maybe she should have been more thoughtful but these kind of misunderstandings happen in a marriage. (At least they do in mine) She was probably just very happy with the present from her sister and didn't think anything further about any consequences. And because it was only for a day or so so probably, in her mind it was no big deal.\n\nBut I can also understand your emotional reaction, especially if her family has been, and is, a thing of contention between you two. The replacement of your anniversary painting with her sisters painting probably triggered this, which is completely understandable. We're humans and humans are emotional beings, so don't beat yourself up about this.\n\nI think if you sit down together and have a good talk about this situation you will be ok. \nIf she understands your feelings about your special altar and the painting that's part of it, she should respect you enough to not remove the painting again without at least some agreement from you. (I think the kind of altar place is a very good thing btw.)\n\nIt can be very difficult in a marriage, if one of the in-law families doesn't respect the marriage or the other half. It sucks, I know from my own experience. But if you regularly talk about each other's feelings on this and be honest, it will get better because you both get a chance to get things off your chest and there will be a better understanding about the feelings you both have. It will probably always be a little sore and painful thing (I don't know the proper English way of saying this) but while that sucks, your relationship doesn't necessarily have to suffer. Maybe go for some counselling, but make the talks a regular thing.\n\nShe has only one family and for her that relationship is important. But for you the rejection by her family is very painful and that is also a very legitimate feeling. And it is unfair and bigoted ofcourse.

I think a lot of people would be upset if they came home and found their spouse had replaced their wedding pictures with something that had a negative connotation (her homophobic family, your feeling she prioritises them etc.).\n\nI think the painting and your reaction to it is masking the larger issue; you need to talk about clear boundaries when it comes to her family and hoe you can all navigate them.", "YTA - take the judgement and do better", "Sorry OP but YTA.

Sorry if that\u2019s not a good way to do it.) \n\nWhat?!\nI can\u2019t imagine how hurt I would be if I got an anniversary gift for my partner, male or female, and they took it down without talking to me. Especially to put up yet another piece of art (because it sounds like there are quite a few) done by family. Family who hurt my partner for being themselves and being the person I love. \nI certainly wouldn\u2019t enjoy looking at said family\u2019s art everywhere in the dang house and bedroom! But the OP hasn\u2019t said she\u2019s asking her to take down all the other art, just don\u2019t take down their anniversary present to put more up.\n\nIt\u2019s not just wall art/decor, and I\u2019m not sure how everyone is looking at it as claiming territory? Does that mean the sister is claiming the whole house since her art is everywhere else? Does the OP not get at least an opinion in decorating their shared house and bedroom?\n     It\u2019s a sentimental gift representing their relationship with what sounds like a lot of thought put into it. Even if the partner didn\u2019t like the painting or agree with the sentiment, she should have considered how hurtful it would be to take something like that down without even talking together about it first. \n\nTo anyone who says it\u2019s just decor, art evokes feelings and memories. That\u2019s why good art is so powerful, you look at a piece and it lights up your whole brain thinking about what that piece means to you. Whether it be your wedding or vacation photos, art your family created, even little bits of not quite matching paint from the day you spent painting the room together and started a paint war that ended in laughter and a huge mess. It all evokes memories and emotions, both positive and negative. \n\nBut back to the post.\nAnd am I the only one who thinks it feels off that the SO asked for this painting for their kids room, but when she got it immediately took down the OPs gift and put it up instead? In their bedroom! To me that\u2019s disrespectful and hurtful. \nIf it was just switching around decor then why did it need to be that particular piece and not another? \n\nEveryone talking about the OP being jealous of the art and how they don\u2019t like that the OP disapproves of some of the sisters art in the kids room. Would you want your kids growing up looking at a physical reminder that part of the family is ok with hurting their mom? All because their religious beliefs are more important to them? And that their mom is not only accepting of it, but regularly prioritizes the hurtful family over their own partner? The OP may not like it, but she isn\u2019t taking it down and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to state disapproval or dislike in a relationship. Certainly not in a shared house. \n\nHow many of these paintings are there? Does the OP even get a say in the decorations other than that one anniversary piece? If there are dozens of these hanging up in the house and the partner takes the one gift from OP down to hang yet another, then I can absolutely see why the OP feels like she never gets to be the priority in her own relationship. Especially if this has been an issue that required counseling in the past. Nowhere in the post does it say the OP is asking her partner to stop loving and caring for her family. From what I\u2019m reading it seems to me that she as the chosen partner just wants to feel she has a place of priority in their life and home too. \n\nTo me it would be as if the partner had taken down the only wedding photo of the two of them, to put up another family photo. When there is already half a dozen other family photos up and that wedding photo was literally the only photo of just them up on the wall in the whole house. Need more information to see if that\u2019s an accurate representation, but it certainly sounds as if that\u2019s what happened.\n\nIt would be different if the new painting had some sort of significant life altering meaning behind it and was discussed with the OP first, since it is their bedroom. Or if the situation was reversed and none of the art on the walls represented the family because the OP didn\u2019t like it and her partner just wanted to have one of her family up too. But to take down a significant gift that represented their partnership and love for each other? To hang up yet another piece of the family\u2019s art? The family who constantly hurts the partner, and by extension the OP since she cares about her? The family who has had such an impact on their relationship that it required counseling in the past? \nTo me that absolutely shows how little the partner thinks about the OPs feelings inside the home that is supposed to be a safe harbor for them to grown together with their children. \n\nEven if unintended and the partner never thought of it that way or meant to hurt you, that hurts more. Because in your mind they should have. They should have known that something you made clear was very important to your relationship (she described it as an alter and said the partner had voiced feedback in the past that reinforced this idea).\n\nI would be furious because I was so hurt.", "Amplifying this correct comment.  \n\n\nNTA: Your intimate bedroom space is yours.

My wife, 31F, isn\u2019t a huge fan of all the sports memorabilia I have around the house (I have my own office with signed bats, signed balls, jerseys, and framed pictures hanging all over the walls).

Some of those pieces are the ones hanging in common areas. The other day, he got me an autographed jersey from my favorite baseball player. My wife decorated our bedroom and hung a sentimental painting dedicated to our relationship. Although I had room to hang it in my office, I decided I wanted to feel like I was sleeping in a sports bar for the night, so I took down this sentimental painting and hung up the autographed jersey. My wife got home and was absolutely pissed that I would disrespect our relationship in this way. When I reminded her it was just for one night, she still told me to fuck off and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since.
