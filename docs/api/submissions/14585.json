You sound controlling AF. Her family is still family and important to her and you\u2019ve failed to list any real reason why that\u2019s a problem with you. Your problem was before you were married, and frankly you weren\u2019t family when you weren\u2019t being prioritizing as such, so boo hoo. Get over it.", "YTA. She wanted to hang it for one night. You are completely overreacting. It doesn't make your painting less special. She is allowed to have sentimental attachment to multiple things.", "YTA\n\nFor one night? \n\nA lot of people have complicated relationships with their family. You're allowed to love them even if they're awful.\n\nFor one night, at least.", "YTA. You\u2019re blowing this so much out of proportion that clearly it\u2019s not about paintings but about you having unresolved issues with your wife\u2019s family/sister. Seems like you need to go back to therapy so you can sort out why you feel threatened by your sister in law.", "YTA. You're furious over less than 24 hours of having different ARTWORK.\n\nYou're even mad that your sil even made artwork for your kids.", "YTA\n\nIf it's not about you OP then it's automatically not okay.  This needs to be cross posted into a narcissist group. You're mad that her sister did  custom paintings for your kids?? That just automatically means you wife prioritizes her sister over you??\n\nOof... And this is just what you wrote from your view.  I can only imagine what your wife would actually write .", "YTA. Once you give a gift to someone it is no longer yours.

You sound very controlling.", "YTA.\n\nI understand that it feels like the past is being dug up, but you are taking this the wrong way. She wanted to hang it up for one night, not completely replace it. Also why are you so against her displaying her sister's artwork in your children's room? Maybe I'm missing something here but that sounds rather controlling...", "YTA - she was planning on hanging it for a single night. One single night. Your reaction was over the top.\n\nAlso, who the hell has a problem with Calvin and Hobbes?", ">My wife claims that she \u201cjust wanted to remember her young years for a night\u201d and that she was planning on putting the drawing in our sons room in the morning am our painting back up on the wall\n\nI understand that you guys have a history with her prioritizing her siblings in a detrimental way and you might be vigilant, but it sounds like she's just being sentimental here. If this was the straw that broke the camels back, there's a bigger conversation worth having. But she did say she would move it. It seems like you're being unfair.", "You yelled at her about a painting? And you have to ASK if YTA??", "I didn't even read it but yelling for whatever reason is an asshole thing to do.

Everything in your life is yours and you control all of it and YTA", "YTA you sound like a self absorbed narcissist. You keep changing your story to not liking the family then it just being the sister. Also it doesn\u2019t seem like your poor wife puts her family above you. She can love her family still. Not wanting to be there when she spends time with her own family is a tell tell sign that your the issue. This is how abusers slowly start isolating their victims", "What I\u2019m gathering here, is that her family sees right through your bs and sees you as what you are, controlling and manipulate. So they don\u2019t like you, and because of that you now don\u2019t want your wife associating with them.

You bought it to hang there, she didn\u2019t really have a say in it.

This is home decor, and why couldn't both painting's be hung?  OR even matter all that much?  Do you really put that much emotional value on objects?  Or do you just simply always need to be the center of her life?  In a more sane moment maybe, consider your stating in this post that you are jealous of a painting.", "It's her painting, she can throw it away and you still have no right to say anything.", "YTA based on the post and an even bigger one based on your replies to other comments.", "YTA. This is not a situation where yelling at your wife is appropriate. Look at the big picture here... It's only a painting and in this case seems temporary... chill man. (But also surely your room is large enough to handle 2 paintings long term if need be?)", "YTA fir getting \"furious\" but given the circumstances, I'd be upset too. Back to therapy for both of you.", "YTA\n\nYou sound very controlling. Why does she need your approval to hang anything anywhere?   It's clearly not about the painting.", "YTA for being controlling, trying to isolate your wife from her family and shouting at her for \u2018daring\u2019 to put up a painting in her own home.", "You are wildly over reacting and she will now associate this fight with your picture. Every time she looks at it she'll remember how you flipped out when she hung a family members art in her own home. The picture is not longer sentimental, YTA", "YTA. The common problem is all of this is you, not her family, is she even allowed to see her family? Or do you try to control that as well?", "Idk\u2026 there\u2019s much more to the story with the way you reacted. So it\u2019s kind of hard for me to decide whether you are the AH. Idk why she would hang the painting on your bedroom wall when she could\u2019ve  just hung it up where she intended to put it. Sounds like she purposely did it to get a reaction but idk. Good luck.", "If you actually yelled at her, ESH, you are worse. Can\u2019t be coming at every situation with so much emotion, it won\u2019t help anyone and will make things escalate further. \n\nAlso it may be good for you to understand that not everyone holds the same sentimental value you do. She may not care nearly as much about the painting as you, and it would be rude of you to force her to do so. \n\nHowever, I do find it incredibly weird that she wanted to hang it up \u201cfor one night\u201d but also wanted to \u201ctreat the kids the same.\u201d That seems bizarre and makes no sense. Who hangs a picture for a night only to move it immediately after?", "The Iranian yoghurt is not the issue here.

This reaction is wild over one single night", "YTA, i feel incredibly sorry for your kids. I hope your narcissism doesn\u2019t infect them.", "YTA - she put up the picture for one night! One night!!! There\u2019s nothing wrong with that - it doesn\u2019t mean your marriage is ending, it doesn\u2019t mean she loves her sister more then you, it doesn\u2019t mean anything apart from she wanted to hang a picture of Calvin and Hobbes in her bedroom FOR ONE NIGHT! Stop being so insecure - it\u2019s just a picture and you are reading too much into it! \n\nAlso - why are you injecting to her hanging the picture in the 2.5 yr old room - do you know how fortunate the could is to have an aunt who loves him so much she did him a picture. YTA", "If I had you as a husband I would for sure choose the people who I was literally birthed around before you.

YTA.", "I\u2019m sorry but you need help. You seem to think your reaction to this is normal but it isn\u2019t. There might be some old pain or trauma in play here but your reaction is completely out of proportion to the minor thing that happened here. If you can\u2019t see that you really need a professional to help you with this.", "YTA. You made a scene for her switching it for the night. And also, what\u2019s with your issue with the kids having a paint made by their aunts? I bet there is much more to the story that you avoided mentioning. Makes me wonder how many red flags there were when you were dating that made her sister dislike you.", "Oh yeah, Y absolutely TA here. This is a terrible reaction to something, even you admitted, she\u2019s loved and held dear since she was a teenager. The fact that you just decided to be petty and say \u201cher sisters basic drawing\u201d when it\u2019s obviously something she loves and it\u2019s for one of your kids?

You sound so controlling. This is not about pairings or whatever. You guys need to figure out the \u201clong story\u201d part. \n\nFor this post alone, YTA. Calm down man. Find your words and a calm way to approach this. You are her husband but her family is her family. Don\u2019t make her pick.", "YTA. You are totally overreacting, and tbh I worry about your wife. She seems to be a good woman who doesn't deserve to be with such a controlling AH of a husband. \n\nIt is a painting. It is not your relationship, even though if she finally sees the light and throws you out I won't blame her. \n\nLet me remind you that your wife didn't spontaneously spawned in the world. She comes from a family and has the right to keep having a relationship with them if that's what she wants, and accepting gifts from her family if she sees it fit. You, on the other hand, have absolutely no right to forbid her to interact with her family, her memories and any and all gifts she receives, either from family or whoever. \n\nYou claim that it is a lack of communication. Have you ever discussed with your wife about which place you are going to put a picture you like? Have you ever asked her for her input on any decisions you make? Your behavior points to no. And besides, such trivial things shouldn't even be a topic of discussion. \n\nI hope your wife sees this red flag for what it is and wakes up. \nAnd just for good measure, YTA YTA YTA", "YTA and controlling af apparently yeesh", "YTA PFFFFFFT seriously? You can't handle a painting being moved for a night? What are you afraid is going to happen if it gets moved? Also, you voiced your disapproval of a painting done by your sil for your child? Why? You seem to really feel threatened by your sil's artwork.", "YTA she wanted to hang up the painting for a single night. If this is how you react then I feel bad for your wife. I also feel like she doesn\u2019t actually \u201cpicking her family over you\u201d. You\u2019re just extremely self absorbed and can\u2019t stand he attention not being focused on you. No wonder you guys are in therapy, you\u2019re a control desk trying to isolate her from her family.", "YTA and you need some therapy for these issues you have. She is allowed to have a relationship with her family. She didn't do anything wrong. It was ONE NIGHT and you are throwing a toddler tantrum over it. Stop it. Get some help.", "YTA for yelling at your wife. The rest of the words are useless. I think you should leave her.", "It's giving 'the Iranian yoghurt is not the issue'\n\nSeriously though, my partner switches up the art in our house all the time and it's never made me freak out or question our relationship. So maybe think about why this sent you into such a tailspin.", "Overreacting would be taking the painting you bought her and throwing in the trash and then having you family paint a bunch of stuff and hang it all over the house. But I'm petty and go over board to make a point. \nYTA While you wife absolutely favors her family over you, this painting isn't the hill to die on. After expressing your annoyance, you should've just packed up the painting you bought her and put it away. If she actually likes it, she'll ask about it, if not it'll tell you that she doesn't like it. Also you two need to talk about boundaries and personal space. I think you issues are deeper than home decor, but it is a symptom you can treat by talking.", "ESH.\n\n  She has a pass of putting  you last, so yes this hurt because she did it again. This is more than the painting and it sad  that people cant see that.  It   is you , yet again being number 2 in her life and her family nr 1.\n\nWhen it is such important picture,  you talk to your spouse before removing it , because that what adults do .\n\nAnd if she is allowed to change decor so are you, so just hang the painting back.\n\nAnd trust me if  gender was reversed in this, no one would scream  yta.", "No, NTA. It's something you bought, but not for HER, but for the two of you together. An anniversary gift. Especially combined with the fact that there has been therapy where she places her family above her spouse, you have every right to be upset about this. Your wife should not have inserted your sister into your bedroom without discussing this with you. \n\nThere is no way to know if she did this 'for one night', but I'm guessing she wanted it to be permanent.", "NTA. Your wife is a liar and definitely tried it. Had you not said anything, that picture would still be hung up in place of the other one.", "NTA\nYour room is a space for the both of you. Even for one night, taking something that is sentimental and relative to your relationship in your shared space can feel violating. The drawing could have been propped up in her view for the night or she could look at in the baby\u2019s room where it was intended. Or anywhere else. Disregarding your feeling of being overshadowed by her family is being visually displayed. So, it\u2019s completely valid that you have these strong feelings about it. Even if only for the night. It\u2019s jarring for you and inconsiderate on her end.", "ESH-your wife knows what this means to you and chose to swap it out \u2018just for one night\u2019 and gave a lame excuse on top of that.  You felt this was like the old days and it triggered you, causing you to overreact and act out.  You both need to talk these things out, why did she feel it was ok to do this and why did you feel the need to get so upset about it?  Maybe she could have asked first and maybe you could have been more understanding\u2026either way it shows you have a long way to go in counseling\u2026I wish you luck.", "NTA.  From the other painting, it sounds like there\u2019s already issues you guys need to talk out.  I\u2019d be angry too, if she took a painting down that was symbolic to the relationship for a painting that someone in her family gave her.  She could\u2019ve waited for the next day to hang it in son\u2019s room, and not have it in your room at all\u2026", "Can you Show the pictures, please.?", "Esh, how I read this, you are living in a 2 bedroom house and the 10 month old is sleeping in the parents bedroom for now.  The wife was putting the new painting up in their room where the 10 month old is currently.  To do this she took down a piece of art that was special to the husband.  Without showing him or asking how the OP felt about it.\n\nShe could have hung the new painting in the other bedroom with the other painting.  The 10 month old would be moving into that room with his brother eventually.\n\nI think SIL for whatever reason gets under the husbands skin.  So, whenever he perceives her getting put ahead of him, the reaction is bigger just because it is the SIL.\n\nAnd, before anyone steps out and says its her house and she can decorate it as she wants.  Does the same hold true if he takes all of the knick knacks off the mantle.  Then puts up a 76\" flat screen and a big obnoxious lazyboy recliner chair to watch the game on?  Without asking if it would be ok?", "ESH. She should have asked your permission first, but you're overreacting to this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I want to add that, because counselors aren\u2019t always trained in spotting narcissistic behaviors, sometimes counseling is just another way for abusers to control their victims. If a counselor thinks they\u2019re dealing with a normal couple, they will suggest ways to improve the hurtful behaviors that the victim is being accused of and the abuser is given extra reinforcement that their victim\u2019s behavior is \u201cwrong\u201d and needs to be fixed.", "Yes, you\u2018re overreacting.", "I don't believe it was for one night only. You called her out, and that's the story she's spinning. Still, you shouldn't be shouting and she should have spoken to you first, being ot is so sentimental.

And a sad one at that", "OP, what is really going on here? Is this really because she didn't seek your prior permission to move one painting temporarily?

If she isn\u2019t able to take it down for even one night it was never a gift for her.  If you give someone a gift they get to choose how it\u2019s used. Most importantly it was ONE night and you chose to yell at her over the painting. Over a painting dude. You yelled at your wife someone you should love over a painting. Think about that. Ignore all the issues you have with her family. Is that how you should be treating someone you supposedly love?", "YTA for saying 31 is \u2018later in life\u2019.\n\nNot even joking, you seem to put a lot of pressure on yourself and others for things that are mostly in your head.", "I think you are more invested in this relationship than she is.", "Yta and 31/36 is not later in life that's normal.", "ESH\n\nI think you definitely are overreacting and should really try to understand that different people value different things in different amounts. And it turns out that she clearly values her family a great deal, you need understand that, and that you cannot change it, no matter how much you don't like it. If you love her you need to accept this and let it go. it doesn't make you, or your relationship, or your painting any less special.\n\nHowever, I do think she was also a bit inconsiderate. if it's true you've had years of counseling as a couple, I think she could've also realized that this probably meant a lot for you too and could've taken your feelings a bit more into consideration. Like talking about it beforehand to gauge your opinion or try to express how much it means for her, or she could've also chosen a different spot to hang it without having to replace where yours was.\n\nEither way, you both seem like you need to be more understanding of each other and willing to make ends meet. Good luck", "Putting aside the whole painting in your room thing for a minute- why do you disapprove of the sister's art in your 2.5 yo kid's room?\n\nNow going back to the painting in your room - Jesus christ you yelled at her over decorations? Do you not have any other wall in the house you could hang that picture on? I'm sure the sister's art would have moved to the ten month old baby's room eventually (and you would have disapproved then I'm sure). But you went straight to nuclear mode.\n\nIt sounds like you have a me vs. them mentality about her family, and that's a fight you're going to lose. Good luck. YTA", "Thanks for the insight.

I\u2019ll help you out \n\nThe issue is not that she did one custom drawing for one of our kids (the other predates our relationship and it just happens to be in our oldest room)\n\nThe issue is placement of said drawings and lack of communication", "OP is an asshole for sure in this context , but that gift had a sentimental value behind it. It was representative of  them meeting and finding each other , so although it belongs to her , it does belong to him sentimentally.", "You are absolutely correct. It\u2019s not a single piece. Its a few of them. It\u2019s that she gets to make decisions big or small without consulting me but my every move is questioned. Again, long story", "I can understand why the family doesn\u2019t like him", "Thanks for this. We are in counseling for many reasons\u2014 her family, my family- our individual and collective baggage. Not sure why you say that I \u201ccut her off from her family\u201d I encourage her visiting, talking, and whatever she wants to do with her fam\u2026I just don\u2019t want to be a part of it", "This guy sounds like a typical narcissistic abuser, especially the \u201cprioritizing her family over me\u201d when they were still only dating, and thinking he\u2019s being victimized by her when he\u2019s the one yelling. Not to mention the \u201cvoicing my disapproval\u201d comment about the Calvin and Hobbs that\u2019s in the other kid\u2019s bedroom. This post is littered with indicators of abuse.", "IDK if she's actually had problems prioritizing her siblings over him. Siblings are often lifelong relationships. She's well within her rights to maintain those relationships. OP strikes me as a narcissist trying to cut his wife off from her family/network of support.\n\nDude flew off the handle over a decoration. What else is he flipping out about? How often? How bad?", "I agree with this but I think I\u2019m also a bit confused. Did she take down a sentimental picture of them and then replace it with the one her sister drew and leave the sentimental expensive one on the floor? \n\nHis reaction was over the top but I also don\u2019t think I would ever do that. I wouldn\u2019t put up something of my sister\u2019s in place of my husband and I\u2014I would just put it beside or somewhere else. Maybe talk to him about switching them? I think I\u2019m confused because OP\u2019s reaction seems like he has anger issues and his wife just sounds like she either really did have an unhealthy attachment to her siblings or is just a little bit [insert work for not thinking about it/taking others into consideration].", "And he already weaponised therapy in his posts, too. Can't imagine why her family doesn't like him. /s", "Could be because she likes the painting but can\u2019t replace the sentimental value in the bedroom because *see OP\u2019s reaction* so she\u2019s enjoying it for a night. Or testing to see his reaction to the change maybe.", "If his story is accurate, the \"one night\" is what she claimed fairly late in their argument. Personally, I think she was misrepresenting/minimizing to try and end the argument.\n\nFor our 20th anniversary I commissioned a painting from our favorite photo in Paris for my husband. I'd be devastated to find it lying around, not even tucked away appropriately.  Leaving a painting lying flat on a dresser is how it gets ruined (torn, stained, etc) if it's not a glass front. I wouldn't jump to yelling and accusations, but I understand OP's upset. But, your right, she may not value it the way he does. Which makes me sad for both of them. \n\nI like your ESH. OP overreacted immediately, when this could have been solved more easily without the yelling. But wife was definitely reaching around for excuses (the son, one night, but it's my sister, etc) and that makes her a glass bowl too, IMHO.\n\nESH", "Thank you! I 100% agree with this. I felt especially triggered bc she\u2019s always telling me that we need to talk  about things\u2026.that i need to tell her what i think\u2026to me it seems like she wants to have a conversation about every single thing big or small so for her to do something like this without talking especially with such an important thing just felt super hypocritical", "Sorry. I don\u2019t feel comfortable. Such a small world", "That's not remotely the same thing. One is a picture that is easily taken off and on the wall. The other is a heavy object that requires a robust mount. I don't know why you mentioned the recliner because it makes your analogy even worse.

Take your wife at her word, and try to allow some grace - she clearly still loves you and would never want to intentionally hurt you. \n\n\nTry to remember that next time something like this happens, and practice waiting before reacting, you and your wife will be all the happier for it.\n\n\nBest of luck to you both!", "Is your life so boring that you get upset over a dumb painting?", "Disregard the automatic downs. You are really entitled to your feelings. The herd of downs will not say the same if YOU changed the decor...", "Uh-oh. I think we\u2019re finally zeroing in on the issue.

Like I said before STOP CHANGING YOUR STORY", "Changing out a piece of wall decor\u2026temporarily for one evening so that she can enjoy her sister\u2019s talents before placing it in its planned place is\u2026violating your boundaries? \n\nSounds like you\u2019re just throwing out mental health buzzwords at this point.

You are talking about a pattern of behavior.\n\nOh, and FYI I just brokered a deal with a 10yo that he would take exceedingly good care of my Calvin and Hobbes hardback collections while he reads them in exchange for me playing ping-pong at family crap. He just wants someone he knows he can beat.", "So your boundary is that she must not change the location of the painting you gifted her for one night? \n\nDude Idk what the absolute fuck this is, but it\u2019s not a boundary.", "Honestly the way you present yourself here, any family would try to protect your wife and not be loving to you, because you\u2019re not loving to your wife. Could it be the family sees that and that\u2019s their issue with you?", "From your comments, I can see why her family doesn\u2019t like you.", "Accept the judgment, bro. You\u2019re painting yourself even more the AH every comment. YTA. \n\nThrowing tantrums and insulting people is not okay. How often does your wife get this behavior from you? Seek help.", "This kind of snide remark, questioning the intellect/comprehension level of someone who disagrees with you offers a great deal of insight into what your wife\u2019s world feels like.  Yikes.", "No I understand. You got mad because it's something from her sister. She's not supposed to acknowledge her anymore because your supposed number 1... Always.....\n\n\nReread what you wrote. You literally spelled it out for us despite trying to word it out very carefully.", "Wow, okay, jeez. Your true colours really came out with this reply, OP. You sound like a complete narcissist. This isn't about a painting(s) anymore, this is about you controlling the relationship your wife has with her family however possible. That's how this is coming over, and it's not a good look. Sort yourself out.", "OP, based on your replies to people and how rude you are, if I had a husband like you, I too would choose my parents and siblings over you.", "That didn\u2019t take long, here comes the insults!", "Hey, did you ever stop to think that the artwork you got her just isn't her favorite? Like, it's up because you have it to her, but she doesn't even really like it, but you're such a jerk about it (as evidenced by the comment I'm replying to) that she doesn't think she can express her dislike?\n\nIt sounds like she's just stuck with the dumb thing you got her (that is meaningful to *you* but probably not so much to her) but she knows if she ever dared to hang artwork she actually likes you'd turn into the gigantic controlling jerk you're being over 24 hours of non-approved-by-you art. \n\nLike, why do you think her art tastes are equal to her choosing her siblings/parents over you?
