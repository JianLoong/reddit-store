He's going to a beach resort that he's been saving for a while. I have full custody over him but he still sees him mom somewhat regularly. His mom is really controlling and didn't want him to go. I thought it was fine as long as he kept his grades up and he has straight A's. He's been waiting to go since his friends planned it so I didn't want to take it away now that the time has come. His mom called me an asshole for not listening to her and being neglectful towards him. He's almost an adult and has never done anything proving he's untrustworthy so I don't really see where she's coming from. When I asked her why she felt like he shouldn't go the only response I got was he shouldn't be trusted for something this big but never said why.

Another of the kids\u2019 parents rented the house and several of them went.  In our case we even helped pay for the house but no parents were there.  They were 17 and 18 years old and would all be going away to college the following school year. They were fine.  I don\u2019t think all 17 year olds are responsible enough for that but my son and his friends were."]}
