He can\u2019t stay with you at your house, if he\u2019s allergic to dogs as YOU HAVE A DOG. End of conversation. \n\nRe the badmouthing you. Don\u2019t worry,  not one single reasonable person will think he\u2019s anything but an AH to expect that! \n\nFor those that are sending you nasty messages, just reply \u201cGreat we\u2019re glad to hear you are so concerned about X, as clearly you will offer him a place to stay. We will let him know to call you and will give him your address\u201d", "Makes sense why he is going through a divorce", "Exactly and the ones defending the friend are assholes too!", "If this is the guys behaviour, I guess we know why he\u2019s going through a divorce", "He has other options, like getting a hotel. You aren\u2019t leaving him on the street.", "If I was the wife (possibly the daughters too) this would be a core memory of OP. Honestly, if my husband attempted to get rid of our current dogs for a friend like this I\u2019d be questioning staying in the relationship. The audacity and entitlement of the friend.", "The OP dodged a major bullet.", "Maybe this is why the wife is divorcing his a$$", "Also ask why his ex wife is divorcing him", "100% this! \n\nAll the people being shitty can house him! I never understand it when people complain about others when they themselves won't help.", "Hopping on the top comment to say I\u2019d cut him out of my life immediately for making such an asinine request.", "Yeah honestly I\u2019d be so weirded out by the sudden request to get rid of my dog and then badmouthing to friends when I refuse, that I\u2019d never speak to him again.", "I don\u2019t think a tool of this magnitude meant \u201efinding a new home\u201d for the dog. I don\u2019t usually make assumptions in AITA but I\u2019m ready to bet he meant giving the dog up to a shelter.", "It's a time honoured theme in AITA: \"My friend/family member made an unreasonable request and I said no. Third parties who can fulfill the request themselves are calling me TA for not doing it. AITA?\"", "I\u2019m sure they are def laughing at him. You don\u2019t ditch family pets for your bro. That\u2019s not how it works.", "Definitely agree their home was never a viable option. Sidenote I hate the term \"Rehome\" when it comes to getting rid of pets. It's just churching up abandoning a pet and the responsibility that goes with it.", "He was already demanding that they pay to deep clean the place before he graced them with their presence. Can you imagine what else would be demanded (dog notwithstanding).  How dare you not have fresh organic produce at the ready!  You cooked with ginger, how dare you!!  Your children are required to be absolutely silent while he\u2019s asleep!", "My sentiments exactly.", "I would choose my dog over any of my friends. The love you receive from a dog is probably the only true unconditional love there is", "Yes, if the friend had told op about his wanting you to get rid of the dog, op would have said no at the beginning", "No wonder he is going through a divorce. NTA! Whoever texts you telling you are an AH, ask them how long are they hosting him", "I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t honest to their mutual friends about what happened", "This guy knowingly asked a friend with a dog to stay at his place, and then expected his allergies to be catered to. Like, that's not how this works. And every single person telling OP he's an AH for not rehoming his dog, needs to explain why he needs to rehome a family pet to add an extra human to his property, and why none of them are willing to take him in and potentially get rid of their dogs.", "Certain breeds give me hives if I'm in the same room but I've still got 2 dogs and want another when I have the space. I once told a friend \"I've got allergies, not self-control\" \ud83d\ude02 it's manageable if you stay on stop of allergy meds, cleaning, and maintain an air purifier (which he should've done as the one with allergies).", "The ones defending the friend are assholes too?", "I'm shocked mutual friends call OP to call him an asshole. I simply cannot imagine anyone I know doing that. Even if the friend exaggerated the situation, who jumps to making a mean phone call without considering if the stuff they heard is at all true?", "Hopefully she got herself a dog soon after.", "[removed]", "The thing that gets me is that he asked to stay first and THEN mentioned getting rid of the dog. He knew they would have to in order for him to stay, so he got confirmation before letting them know a MAJOR issue with him staying there. It's like if he asked to stay and then said \"okay let me know when you repaint the whole inside because the paint you used triggers my allergies\"", "Nah for get the kids, if my dog is my family dog then I'm not going to put myself through guilt and pain of having to rehome him for someone temporary. I can't even imagine putting my dog with other friends or family for the time period like what was this guy thinking", "AND wanting them to deep clean their house afterward! I can only imagine what kinda bs he must've been forcing or trying to force his wife to do. Definitely get why he's getting divorced", "You are being generous in your assumption, my first thought was that \u201cgotten rid of the dog\u201d was an underhanded way of saying \u201cgotten the dog put down\u201d! NTA", "Depends on what you mean by \"Rehome\". If you for example got a dog to train it for search and rescue, but it turns that the dog doesn't have a suitable personality, so instead you find a home for it with acquaintances that want a family dog. Then that's IMHO a proper rehoming, and not \"churching up abandoning a pet\".", "How dare they not have artisanal beer and non-sparkling water!", "Totally agree", "I wonder if the friends he\u2019s badmouthing to have dogs\u2026 or a couch. Sounds like he has plenty of friends to ask, and asked the guy with the family and dog anyway. That guy sucks so bad it\u2019s not even funny.", "That's how I am with dogs and cats! I couldn't imagine living without my cats, even when I was having really bad issues (unrelated, didn't have a vacuum, had 2 cats and a husky) the doctors gave me the dirtiest looks when I said I wasn't willing to throw my family away since there are ways to manage this.", "Bot", "But, way worse as this is about a living, breathing, thinking and feeling being. A huge part of the family."]}
