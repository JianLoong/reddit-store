This guy is a complete tool. NTA. Ask the people calling and defending them why they aren't housing him. Don't let anyone guilt you about this, you're doing the right thing.", "NTA. One of the other people in your friend group can accommodate him by getting rid of their own pets and paying for a deep cleaning. If he really needs a place to stay, he can try a hotel or whatever, but how urgent can he be if he can wait for you to find a new home for a family member? Just the suggestion to get rid of your pup would have been enough for me to say no.", "NTA\n\nIf he\u2019d ask that the dog be kept out of his sleeping area, that would be totally reasonable. \n\nBut if his allergy to dogs is so severe that it can\u2019t be managed with antihistamines/he can\u2019t be in an area a dog has been in, then your home was never a suitable option for him. \n\nHe should have realized that instead of asking you to rehome your dog.", "Why aren\u2019t all these other friends offering up a place to stay? Next phone call or text you get asking you: \u201cGosh! I sure am glad you called. I\u2019ll let friend know if your concern and offer to let him stay with you.\u201d And then listen to the spluttering. \n\nNTA. But, boy, your friends sure are judgmental people.", "NTA, you can't send away a family member coz of a person who is in the process of divorce, loo. Beggars can't be choosers", "NTA in any way, shape or form. Who does he think he is, lol? That's astounding nerve, wow.", "NTA. There might be a reason he is so down on his luck if he is making those demands. I also question the level of friendship everybody is if they are critiquing your very normal decision to not get rid of your dog to accommodate them. In fact since they are so concerned for his well being they can take him in.", "NTA. How could he expect you to get rid of your family dog? You were gracious to offer but you're definitely not the A-hole here.", "Wow! Just let him know once you got rid of the dog AND deep cleaned the house? Those are some crazy expectations. NTA and don't let anybody tell you different.", "Nta-you didn\u2019t rescind your offer to stay. This guy wanted you to boot a family member, so he would be able to stay. Sounds like you dodged a bullet here, guy sounds quite unreasonable", "NTA. *He* is asking *you* for a favor. He is the one in a desperate situation. He does not get to dictate the situation at your home. He especially does not get to tell you to get rid of a family member (yes, a pet is a member of the family). This is beyond arrogant. \n\nAnd he is getting divorced, he isn\u2019t unemployed. He has other options, like getting a hotel. You aren\u2019t leaving him on the street. \n\nFinally, it is the act of a bully for him to get other people to call you and harass you about this. That is wrong on so many levels no think it is safe to say he is a *former* friend. \n\nI think you really avoided a problem here - if he is being this much a problem when he hasn\u2019t even moved in, what kind of demands would he have made once he got in, and how would he have treated your kids?", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s in no way reasonable to assume someone will get rid of their dog for you\u2026 He changed the parameters of the arrangement, not you, so you didn\u2019t take anything back\u2026 you just responded to the change. He can live with one of your friends who are wrongly calling you the ah.", "NTA and who tf are these friends??? Maybe re-evaluate the friends you have if these are people giving you shit!!! \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. And no one is going to take his side. But I\u2019m sure they are def laughing at him. You don\u2019t ditch family pets for your bro. That\u2019s not how it works.", "Hahahaha, WHAT?? Your friend is ridiculous. Of course you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA \n\nReply to anyone giving you shit with a link to this thread.", "NTA. Say so long to your ex-friend.", "NTA. And those that are calling you to bitch can offer him a place to stay.", "NTA You're not choosing a dog over him.  What you're doing is deciding not to disrupt your entire family's lives because he didn't disclose his allergy when he asked to stay with you.  If anyone calls you an AH ask why they aren't welcoming him into their homes.", "NTA\u2026. You offered him a place to stay out of kindness after he asked. Now he suddenly had demands that you have to kick ur dog out and deep clean ur place. He should have told you about this before rather than after you accept to give him shelter.\n\nSounds you have to thank your dog cause seen you dodge a bullet there.", "You are NTA at all! This person is awful! Don\u2019t feel bad about this for a nano-second even.", "NTA. Now you know why he's getting divorced and \"down on his luck.\" He's as entitled as dammit and thinks the world revolves around him. Tell your friend group to take him in.", "NTA. I hope you have dumped him and any \"friends\" who agree with him.  A dog is a lifelong commitment and you have more responsibility to the helpless dog than the crappy human trying to take advantage of you who can figure out their own life themselves.", "NTA. If this isn't fake can you imagine what his soon to be ex-wife had to put up with.\n\nThe people calling you an AH can take him in.", "NTA -please tell those friends calling that you're glad they're better people than you since they must be taking him in...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His expectations are unreasonable. It isn't about dog vs. human, it's about valuing yours and your families wellbeing over his, a (seemingly shitty, friend).
