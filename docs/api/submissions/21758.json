If you can't stay in my house as it is, my house is not for you.", "I wouldn\u2019t even entertain the suggestion. Any accommodations I offer are as-is. Don\u2019t want that, don\u2019t ask.", "There\u2019s also just falling in bad financial straits, and unfortunately not being able to care for them anymore.", "What's the bet that it's this type of entitlement and AH behavior that's leading to his divorce.", "Not only that, this friend knew OP would have to do a bunch of extra stuff (giving up the dog *and* deep-cleaning the home on his own dime) to accommodate the friend, and he did not mention that when asking OP. Given his behavior now, I\u2019m having trouble believing that was an oversight or miscommunication on his part, rather than a deliberate deception.", ">\"my home is not suitable for someone with that allergy\" is a reasonable reason why to retract an offer,\n\nIt sure is. \n\nBut afaik, OP *didn't even retract the offer.* It just didn't include adjusting the home or evicting family members for his unmentioned allergies. \n\n\nWith an attitude like that, OP dodged a bullit.\n\n This is not a 'gracious and grateful guest'. How long before other demands were made? Kids too loud, awake too early? \n\nProbably wants to be catered too as well..  Drink sir? Shall I prepare dinner for you sir? What time would *you* like to eat? \n\nOne wonders why such a catch is divorced...", ">Seriously, they want him to send his dog to the pound so this guy can crash at his place for just a little while.\n\nYeah, once this guy gets in it will take legal action to get him back out.", "Asking OP to rehome the dog sounds like this ~~scrub~~ friend is looking for a longer term solution than a couple weeks.", "The husky alone with no vacuum would be so rough, but still not worth rehoming. I've also had a medical provider (eye doctor) refuse to even have a conversation about contacts as a teen because I had a cat and dog at home. New doctor was surprised I wasn't wearing contacts and when I explained why, he said that was stupid because eye drops exists, then fit me for them.", "Yup. Karma is a bitch \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "100% this kind of manipulation has led to his divorce.", "I know what you mean with having 2 huskies and acat that moults.  A friend of mine is allergic to dogs but grew up with them and has a family rescue dog.  There are meds and a dog is part of the family! Hell no!"]}
