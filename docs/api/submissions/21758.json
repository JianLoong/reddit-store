My heart dog, River. \n\nBrandy and River were my service dogs. My heart breaks more each time I let my dogs go on to a forever without pain or suffering. I know in my heart that it is the final, kindest and most loving thing I can do for them but it hurts like hell. The most generous thing we can do for our dogs is let them go before they suffer and the animals we love become trapped in a prison of pain. \n\nEach food I\u2019ve lost has broken my heart into pieces, like a piece of pottery shattering when dropped. The Japanese have a tradition called kintsugi. When something is broken, it gets repaired with gold to hold the pieces together again. Each dog I lose breaks my heart. Each new dog comes in and heals my heart with their love, leaving gold behind. It\u2019s my hope that one day I\u2019ll have been loved by so many amazing dogs that my heart will be pure gold, just like theirs. \n\nI hope this happens for you, too."]}
