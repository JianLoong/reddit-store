Whenever someone brings up any topic that involves something happening in the future, she always responds with some variation of \"well the world is going to end by then anyway.\" It's pretty aggravating, because it adds nothing of value to the actual topic of conversation. Whether the topic is career goals, financial planning, vacation ideas or anything else, she always interjects with her apocalyptic predictions.\n\nRight now my union is negotiating for a raise for us, and I am excited about it. I was telling my brother and sister about how excited I am and how I intend to put the money towards my retirement savings. Again, brother's girlfriend interjected that none of us will live to see retirement, so it doesn't matter. I got annoyed and snapped at her, saying \"hey, learn a new song. This one is played out.\"\n\nMy brother's girlfriend was offended, said I was rude and asked for an apology. I said that I disagreed, thought she was the rude one and would like an apology myself. My brother told me to climb off my high horse and chill. My sister said that she was also tired of the nonstop gloom and doom and would like a reprieve. My brother's girlfriend said \"I see how it is\" and left with my brother.\n\nMy brother said I was needlessly antagonistic. He said his girlfriend can't relate to topics like that because she has a nontraditional job (Etsy store), but wants to have a meaningful contribution to the conversation. He said I was mean to her and should apologize.

I'd hate to have to spend time around someone like that.", "NTA. How are you needlessly antagonistic when she's the one being negative about something you were excited about ? She doesn't need to be able to relate to you to contribute to the conversation. My friend is a stay at home mom. I can't relate to that, but I contribute by asking questions or just commenting that I could never do that, and she's amazing. Both are uplifting bc I know it's something she loves. She could've just said she was happy for you. No need to contribute negativity when someone is obviously excited. \n\nI wouldn't sweat it. She sounds like a drag.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds annoying, I can't imagine talking about serious topics and her just popping into the conversation like that.", "NTA - if anything your response was incredibly mild. She has made it a habit to try to bring down any and all conversations about the future. That's not just rude it's mean. She's basically scolding people for being hopeful.", "NTA. Sure, you could have been nicer. But she can't go around saying things with zero self-awareness and be offended when people don't like what she says. Everyone is aware they will die one day. But to constantly being up our mortality as an excuse to avoid thinking about the future tells me she is too lazy to think.", "I think I would not deal with it the way you did, but I understand how annoying is all this negativity. In my opinion, NTA", "Nta you were talking about your future plans & she decided to shit on it. If she is pessimistic about every future plan she doesn\u2019t care about her future", "NTA. If she feels for some reason, world is going to end down the road that\u2019s her business. But constantly bringing it up is tedious and self-defeating. If She feels like she wants to contribute to the she can talk about arts, movies, sports, etc. etc. She does not get to shove her apocalyptic predictions on the rest of you. \n\nBy the way, tell your brother that when you were talking about saving for retirement, and she brings up, it doesn\u2019t matter that the world going to end. Anyway, she\u2019s kind of shutting down the entire conversation.  Because she\u2019s really saying what\u2019s the point in having this conversation since it won\u2019t matter anyway.", "NTA  He is blind. Thank you for standing up to her for yourself and sister.", "NTA", "NTA, it's inappropriate to interject nihilistic existentialism in every conversation, it brings the mood down. If she can't contribute to the conversation, maybe she just shouldn't be a part of it, instead of dismissing the whole thing with her doom and gloom. \n\nI wonder if the gf had mental health issues, and that's why she expresses that negativity? That's not normal to constantly be saying...", "NTA, but you should apologize, because your relationship with your brother is worth more than being right. Avoid his girlfriend as much as you can, you don't need that negative energy in your life.", "ESH. In this particular scenario, an amalgamation of culpability emerges. On one hand, your brother's paramour incessantly injects her dispiriting and nihilistic prognostications into conversations, thereby obstructing constructive discourse and engendering an atmosphere of frustration. Her unyielding proclivity to foist her bleak outlook upon others is indeed irksome and inconsiderate.\n\nConversely, your impulsive rejoinder, albeit a manifestation of understandable vexation, could be construed as unnecessarily acrimonious. Employing a modicum of diplomacy and articulating your disapproval in a more temperate and respectful manner would have been a more judicious course of action.\n\nYour brother, in his attempt to mollify the situation, adopts a defensive posture, failing to acknowledge the legitimacy of your grievance. As such, all parties involved bear a measure of responsibility for the discord that ensued.", "You probably could have explained that it bothers you and asked her nicely to stop first so maybe a little YTA", "ESH.\n\nBrother's gf is annoying and depressing. At the least, she should see a counselor and work on her people skills.\n\nYou could have been nicer. You do not indicate that anyone ever talked to gf about her annoying habit before you snapped at her. Snapping at her was understandable, but it wasn't appropriate unless ~~if~~ someone had earlier told her she shouldn't make such comments.\n\nYour brother was off-base. His gf might not be able to relate to saving for retirement (or anything else), but her comment was NOT a meaningful contribution to the conversation. Instead of saying you wouldn't see retirement, she could have asked a question about the raise or your savings plans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Correction in second paragraph.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your comments were not personal attacks, and were clever retorts.  Your poor brother seems a bit deluded. GF must be really attractive, in some way. GF?

Maybe she will stay away.", "NTA. i would have been incredibly annoyed by this. you were celebrating your accomplishments when she kind of brushed it off with her pessimism. there are other ways she could have contributed to the conversation like \u201cim happy for you\u201d or \u201coh, thats nice.\u201d but no, she decided to make a statement about everyone probably dying in the future and how your excitement doesn\u2019t matter. sure, maybe you could\u2019ve been nicer, but this habit needs to stop.", "NTA", "Soooo...she thinks Etsy is going survive some apocalypse?", "NTA", "Exactly.

The remark makes much more sense in that context. If she reassures herself that the world is ending, so your future is irrelevant, she doesn't have to compare her future to yours.\n\nTo me, it comes across as a roundabout putdown.

She may be siphoning profits from faceless giant corporations but normal everyday people working for those companies may lose jobs due to lost sales from pirating/bootlegging.
