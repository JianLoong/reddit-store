I can't relate to that, but I contribute by asking questions or just commenting that I could never do that, and she's amazing. Both are uplifting bc I know it's something she loves.

Sure, you could have been nicer. But she can't go around saying things with zero self-awareness and be offended when people don't like what she says. Everyone is aware they will die one day.
