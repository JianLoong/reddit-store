That\u2019s an unusual hour for the weekend.) Yes. However, be a good neighbor and wait until at least 8 am on a weekend. Your neighbor is not out of line. Apartment living only works when people are considerate.", "There are rules, and there are courtesies. Apartment living is hard.

No.  But do you want to make enemies?", "YTA, and I say this with experience in a similar situation. \n\nI live in a unit attached to another by a joint laundry room. The washer is so loud that it shakes my entire unit. At times in the cycle it sound like someone slamming a truck bed closed. It is rough.\n\nPrevious tenants used to do laundry at all hours despite the fact that my sleeping loft was right above the laundry room. I asked nicely if they would be willing for us all to have laundry hours between 8am-10pm as to not disturb each other and they basically were like, \u201cSorry but I\u2019m going to do what I want when I want.\u201d \n\nThe constant laundry made it so I could never sleep and I wound up developing major health issues because of it. I once again reached out, explaining the serious situation and they pretty much said to F off.\n\nAfter those assholes left, another group came in and we EASILY decided together that laundry hours are from 10am-10pm because we want to respect each other and not be AH neighbors. My medical issues faded away as soon as I could rest and my quality of life was restored- all because my neighbors decided to consider my well being as I consider theirs. \n\nJust because something is ALLOWED by a lease doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t need to treat your neighbors with respect. I get where you are coming from- and if it was a weekday and you needed work clothes or something, I might get it, but on a SUNDAY? \n\nYa dude, YTA, 100%. That neighbor of yours must be constantly woken by laundry every day and you ruined his chance to actually sleep on his day off. Not cool.", "YTA. It's 6:20 am. Doesn't matter what the quiet hours say. Use some common sense.", "YTA. Using loud machines at 6am on a Sunday is very inconsiderate of your neighbours. Sure it\u2019s outside of the quiet hours but maybe think about how it\u2019s going to effect others and if getting your laundry done early is worth upsetting people you need to live around. Do you really want to be the neighbour everyone hates?", "How loud are those machines? \n\nI have one in my apartment, next to bedroom, but I hardly hear it. I always have it running at night, because I work during the day.", "It\u2019s not really a am I the ah question. The question is do you really want to get into a rift with your neighbors.\n\nTechnically, NTA but will it become a bigger deal than it\u2019s worth?

Soft, YTA.", "YTA you need to have some consideration for your neighbours. These machines can be loud and just because you are up at 6am don\u2019t  mean your neighbours want to be woken up at that time.", "NTA. I had the unit above the washing room once. Had a couple neighbors who worked third shift and did laundry right when they got home. Annoying but bearable and not my place to tell people when they can and can\u2019t use utilities.", "Not technically doing anything so NTA. But you should be considerate since it is obviously disturbing him.", "NTA. If you can do it at another time great, but I see nothing wrong with it now. With the way more commerce is 24/7 now you always run the risk of disturbing someone somewhere. If that neighbor worked nights and slept in the afternoon would everyone not be able to use the laundry room during that time? \n\nIf it was me and I could easily do it at another time I would, but if the laundry room receives high traffic like stated then I\u2019m not going to give up my whole Sunday standing by and waiting to use the washer and dryer.", "NTA. By their logic, if there was a newborn in that apartment, the neighbour could demand that no one use the laundry room at multiple times of the day and night to ensure their baby could sleep in peace. That\u2019s simply not plausible for shared utility spaces.\n\nThe neighbour is welcome to bring this to the attention of the landlord and ask that limits be set on usage of the laundry room if it\u2019s a huge issue for them.", "NTA. Do your laundry whenever you need to. Sure it sucks for that guy but then he signed a lease for that apartment so it\u2019s his burden to bear. It would be nice if a later time worked but no one is required to take other people\u2019s schedules into consideration when living their life.", "It's great for the neighbor to complain to the landlord, since it's the landlord's fault that there aren't more machines and that it's so hard to do laundry.  I shudder at the thought of getting up at 6am to do laundry, but you should do you, if that's the kind of thing you have to do to get time on the machine.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I used to live in a building with one communal laundry room that was shared between 11 units and it was a nightmare, I had to do my laundry at the crack of dawn or in the middle of the night or my laundry simply wouldn't get done.\n\nThat being said, the next time your lease is up/you plan on apartment shopping, do yourself a favor and pick a complex with in-house appliances. Having my own washer and dryer to use at my own convenience has saved me a lot of headaches, and I've found that apartments with in-house appliances are typically insulated better so noise doesn't travel as much.", "If you have to ask? You know the answer. Would you like that noise at that hour?", "YTA that's way too early in the morning for both night shift workers and day shift workers.", "YTA.

I would be pissed if I got woken up at 6:00 am on a Sunday for something that was not the least urgent.", "YTA\n\nJust because you want to wake up at the asscrack of dawn to do your laundry doesn't mean your neighbor wants to wake up at the asscrack of dawn so you can do your laundry.

And mention the lack of soundproofing too.", "NTA. \n\nThat's part of the fun of living where he lives - he is free to go complain to the landlord about his situation, but you stuck to the rules.

That's just how it is sometimes.", "NTA.  When I lived in an apartment, we always did our laundry first thing on Sunday morning.

It's about his expectations of noise on a Sunday morning and the social conventions around that, so regardless of the rules it's 'rude' from his perspective. \n\nAgain, you can disagree all you want and I also agree with the OP. Just expect that if you deliberately ignore the framework he's operating on (social norms vs building rules), not only are you talking past them but they're going to think you're an asshole too.

The guy is within his rights to be annoyed, but per the lease agreement, designated quiet hours, and the fact that OP also pays to live there and use the laundry facilities outside of quiet hours, OP is perfectly within their rights all the way. The threat of telling the landlord seems a little aggressive, but at the same time, he also has the right to do that; presumably he didn't get to pick his exact unit, and I can imagine it would be frustrating to be directly next to the laundry machines at ANY hour given how busy the area is according to OP. Maybe telling the landlord will make the landlord have sympathy (doubtful, LOL, but just saying), and put out an announcement requesting that tenants attempt to use the laundry facilities after 8 or something, where possible --- couldn't hurt for the guy to ask. \n\nEither way, no one is actually in the wrong. I could see myself trying to get something done at an early hour if I was awake anyway and it didn't break any rules, and I could definitely see myself being annoyed and finally saying something if I heard the washing machine going from my apartment virtually all day long.", "Not saying I disagree.
