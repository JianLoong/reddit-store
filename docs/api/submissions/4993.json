I've been to this place multiple times and the nurses who work there do a great job and are all really nice whenever I show up. Since it had been a couple of months since my last donation, I scheduled one for today morning.\n\nNormally, as a right-handed person, I donate from my left arm. Plus I've donated from my right arm before, and that hurt a little more than normal, so I stick with my left. Today, the only open seats had the apheresis machines on the right side, so I chose to use my left arm again with the tubes across my lap. Maybe there was a slightly larger risk of the needle getting dragged within my arm as a result, but I figured it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nAfter my donation was done, the apheresis machine made the beeping sound signaling that the final rinseback was done, and so the needle could be removed. Two young nurses, whom I hadn't seen before and so I assumed they were new, didn't notice the machine beeping until maybe 20+ seconds later, and I was getting a little impatient to get the needle out but I didn't say anything in case they may have been busy. They came over after a nurse who was working on someone else asked for me to be helped, and they apologized for not hearing the machine, which I was okay with, though admittedly it did annoy me somewhat.\n\nThen as the nurse on my left side was disconnecting the tubes, I felt the tubes move slightly on my lap, and the needle in my elbow felt kinda differently positioned. Suddenly I noticed the gauze filling up with blood and I exclaimed \"JESUS CHRIST what did you do??\" While it didn't really hurt, I got scared that I could lose a lot of blood. The nurse on my left apologized and acted quickly to get the needle out and clean up the mess, but I was so annoyed after their delayed help that I kinda went ballistic and said \"What the fuck, you can't let this happen!\" A third nurse further away heard me and asked if I was hurt, and I said \"No, but... fucking shit!!\"\n\nThis seemed to render the nurse on my left silent, and she just wrapped a new gauze around my arm without saying anything. Then as she was wrapping up the needle, two drops of blood fell onto my sweatpants, and I got pissed again and said \"Oh great, now you let blood drip on me.\"\n\nAs the two nurses finished up, I started to feel bad about how I acted, and so I said sorry to them. The nurse who was working on the machine to my right said kindly \"That's okay!\" but the other nurse who removed the needle didn't say anything until she handed me the post-donation pamphlet and kinda curtly said \"You know the drill\" beford walking away.\n\nAs I went to get water, I felt like I was really rude and that maybe I should've apologized again, especially since I wasn't in any pain nor did I lose much blood. At the same time, though, I also think that nurse had to be more attentive and careful, even if she may have been new. Did I go too far in my reaction?\n\n**EDIT**: Well, the sub has spoken! I am the AH. And frankly, y'all are 1000% right. I feel awful, that woman didn't deserve such horrid treatment from me. I'll try to give her a gift ahead of Christmas as atonement.\n\nAnd for real, nurses are heroes and it's awful that they endure this kind of abuse that pushes them out of the profession. Thank you for all that you do, and I promise I will never behave this poorly again.

You have all the information about how crossing arms could lead to the needle being improperly placed, and that the nurses ONLY took a little over 20 seconds to respond to the beeping, and apologized for it when they observed your irritation. You knew the likelihood of the needle causing damage was higher, and while I can understand being initially shocked at the sight of yourself bleeding, you were actively being tended to by a professional, and your reaction was inappropriate, considering your familiar with the process.

It would go a long way, especially if you want to continue donating at that location. \n\nNurses make mistakes; they\u2019re people, too.

I have had a nurse mess up the jab two times and on the third blow the vein and led to a massive bruise. While that is error on their part, it would not excuse me cursing at them for it. I can simply ask for another nurse or understand human error. The fact that you went that ballistic of slight shifting that you knew could happen and two drops of blood? That was incredibly excessive. Donating is a great thing, but even the experienced nurses make mistakes, let alone the new ones. You are a good lesson for them on how to stay cool when they get reactive patients.", "YTA.   You were rude.", "YTA. It's great that you do donate. But your reaction was a bit overboard.

You did overreact. You were very rude. And that nurse did not have to accept your apology. Do you act that way at other places ? Like yell at your hairdresser or server at a restaurant? \n\nAnd 2 drops of blood on your pants is not a big deal. Hydrogen peroxide usually takes it right out. Or spray the area with hairspray before you wash it. \n\nBut seriously, find a new donation center and try to keep your inner asshole tucked in", "YTA. That was a wild overreaction, and having to wait 20 seconds?

Freaked me out, but i still managed to not snap at the nurse, who *clearly didnt intend for that to happen*. Yeah, it can be slightly distressing, but you dont even sound like you have a problem with needles or blood- you were just impatient/in a bad mood and snapped at them. \n\nYou were right to apologise, and i dont think youre, like, a terrible person, we all have moments.

They were notified and immediately attended to you. The choice you made where the needle may be an issue due to going across you to the opposite side was an issue and you took the consequences out on the nurses assisting you for a minor mistake that hurt no one- you poor soul how terrible?! Oh my god and while donating platelets a couple drops got on your sweatpants so you yelled at the nurse AGAIN who was helping you\u2026. Hm were you the AH really gotta think long and hard here YTA  and a major one", "YTA.  Healthcare staff is exhausted and leaving the profession in droves.  Thanks for help push them out the door.", "YTA, and your guilt shows that you know it. It is their jobs to help people. From what you described, it sounds like they were with other patients when the machine went off, not just standing around on their phones. You resorted to quite frankly abusive language (and yes, some hospitals and doctors' offices classify swearing to and around their staff as abusive behavior to their staff) for *very* minor problems. You got blood on you, wow. The needle was in your vein and it can be hard to just prevent any blood from spilling on adjacent materials, especially if you have a high heart rate/blood pressure/etc... which you were already getting annoyed/irritated, I bet your heart was pumping harder than it needed to. \n\nYou are almost 30, you need to act like it and not abuse people who are just trying to help people.

Good thing you are not a female...lots of blood and pain. You would have had the vapors. I actually found this very amusing. That being said that is thoughtful of you to donate in the first place.

Some snacks for the break room would be a really nice thing to do (but pre packaged or via gift card to the nearest place because medical staff won\u2019t eat unsealed food from angry men and neither should anybody else).", "NTA professionals should be more professional.", "Have you considered therapy for your ridiculous overreactions?", "Wow YTA. When I had an iron infusion the nurse accidentally didn\u2019t insert the needle far enough and blood started flowing out. What did I do? I said it was totally OK, that I knew veins can be tricky, and I let her try again.", "You already knew YTA because you said it more than once in your post. You apologized, you felt bad, but it wasn't enough, so you were hoping Reddit would console you. And it won't.  \n\n\nJust work on your anger issues next time. I have them too, it's not always easy, and people do generally brush off a bad day here and there. But you probably traumatized a new nurse or two trying to take blood, which isn't cool. Just think about it more next time.", "Yes, YTA, ya big baby", "You must be an idiot for even asking this question.", "I was in an ambulance and had an EMT put the blood pressure cuff on the same arm they had my IV on. Blood went everywhere, including my white skirt; and I never even considered yelling at the man who is clearly just doing his best.", "Here I was feeling bad that I called to ask for my pain meds again 30 minutes after my first call.", "Just to be clear, the needle wasn't taken out when I saw the blood oozing. I've had minor bleeding when the needle is out in previous donations. This instance seemed like more rapid bleeding than usual, hence why I overreacted.", "I work at a blood donation center and we definitely permanently defer donors for this behavior", "Try waiting tables by a ghetto.", "Again, blood comes out when needles get removed.  That hole doesn't automatically close up and sometimes things enhance bleeding tenancies.  Like taking NSAIDs  before, even a few days before, certain vitamins can cause more bleeding.  Like Vitamin E.", "this nurse clearly wasn\u2019t being abusive tho, and it\u2019s a fact that lots of nurses get treated like this and worse. It\u2019s really important to acknowledge abusive healthcare workers, but it\u2019s also important to acknowledge how the opposite also exists, this post proving it.", "How dare they make him bleed his own blood!!", "I'm the same as you I'm usually puzzled by the whole \"all nurses are rude as heck\" stuff I see. I've been in and out of hospital the past two years and of all the nurses I've had only one was genuinely bad (like negligent bad according to the nurse who found and helped me even though I wasn't his patient. And he only emphasised it was negligent because I was sobbing and apologising to him for taking him away from his work and that I was sure she was just busy and would have helped me eventually).\n\nI'm always as kind to them as I can be. My last surgery I managed to do a pretty spectacular vom where I missed just slightly because I couldn't sit up and it took my nurse 15 min to respond to my call because they're understaffed and she was with another patient. When she arrived she apologised and we both had a laugh about how I looked laying there holding up a vomit covered washcloth in one hand and a full emesis bag in the other. She took away the icky stuff and helped me unhook the drain and shit from the bed so she could help me wash it out of my hair. It was probably more gross for her than it was for me.\n\nThat same nurse also did an oopsie re-cathetering me so my bladder wouldn't burst and accidentally let my extremely full bladder drain all over my feet and I could tell from the way she was apologising when I asked if that was my pee that she was expecting me to abuse her. I just laughed and said it was warm and she got me and the bed cleaned up.\n\nThey deal with enough shit (literally and figuratively) to not be abused over such tiny things. If 2 tiny drops on their clothes freaks OP out I hope they're never in a position to be really sick. You can get covered in a lot more than just that.", "There is still a needle in the arm for the whole blood donation. I\u2019ve donated platelets, sat in the chair for 90 minutes, and had some shift in my arm cause the blood to stop flowing, so they\u2019ll come pull the needle back out a bit and then put it back in place. It\u2019s not like an IV in that way and most definitely can hurt if someone shifts it or even if you just flex your arm muscles too hard. (Although I\u2019ve never yelled obscenities at any nurse because of a blood donation fail. OP is still TA for that.)", "The bleeding happened when the needle was in though.", "I'll just try to be better next time, but I won't stop donating.", "For real. I've only ever had one truly terrible nurse - she accused me of doing drugs, being an alcoholic and threatened to send me home. Shortly after she got done with her spiel about wasting ER time and resources, the Dr came in and told me \"you are very, very sick and can NOT go home\". I was transferred to ICU, I was quite literally dying and my tox screen came back negative, like I said it would. Nurse never did apologize, but she did change her attitude. I still didn't yell at her or anything - while I was and am upset at how she treated me, I sincerely hope she was just having a bad night. \n\nI've had far more exceptional nurses. And I'm the type of person who is hospitalized every couple years (seriously, I have the *worst* luck). I've had a LOT of nurses over the years, from ER to Trauma to ICU to cardiac. My last ER nurse went and got me not one, but two ginger ales after I was finally allowed to drink something - his logic was that the cans were tiny and he didn't want me to have to wait for another one. The nurse who discharged me went and found me a set of scrubs to wear home (all my clothes had been cut off). The trauma nurses were also great, from what I remember, even though I was saying weird shit and cracking jokes. Not mean, just weird, cuz head trauma is cool that way - like I super politely asked one for their name after they asked mine because my brain said it was the proper thing to do, then gave him a thumbs up and told him he had a great name \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f told another one I loved him when he went to administer the meds to sedate me lol \n\nAnd yeah, I can't imagine getting upset over two *drops* of blood. I bleed easily and clot slowly. I've been covered in my own blood before. It's really not a huge deal. My Ortho recently got blood on my shirt after giving me a shot. I just shrugged and said \"atleast I'm wearing black\". Bleeding a little is bound to happen when you are being stabbed by a needle.", "I think people are often rude but expect kindness back. What they don\u2019t seem to understand at all is you get back what you put out in the world. \n\nI don\u2019t find a lot of rude assholes in my daily life. I really don\u2019t. Not at the doctor, not grocery shopping, not on the phone. I genuinely believe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve always believed in the importance of leading with kindness, being polite and thanking people for their help. \n\nIt sounds simple. But unless you\u2019ve worked with the general public, you might not realize how often people don\u2019t do those things. \n\nNurses get shit on all day every day. They have hard jobs. Just being decent and grateful is prob enough to get most of them to go above and beyond for you. \n\nTreat others how you hope they would treat you if the roles were reversed. This is something OP could really use a lesson in", "Blood is a pretty easy stain to get out if you deal with it promptly. Cold running water and scrubbing between your hands usually works. If there's still a visible stain, throw some stain spray on it and wash as normal.", "That, again, can happen.  I've only seen that a few hundred times in the almost 30 years experience I had in all sorts of nursing fields.  Dialysis, med/surge, ICU.   You poke a hole in a human body, blood will do it's best to come out.\n\nGod, I'm glad I took early retirement to babysit my grand kids than deal with patients who think screaming at medical staff is what they need to do.", "Well you might not be welcome anymore... They don't get paid enough to put up with such behavior.", ">I work retail. I get it.\n\nLOL no you do not. I can't believe you actually compared working in retail to being a nurse. Gtfo.", "Even just rinsing with cold water while the stain is relatively fresh (ie a couple of hours not days) followed by a cool wash will deal with the majority of blood stains (I have experience with this due to heavy periods, not a murder spree). All he had to do was pop to the toilets and dab at the droplets with cold water and put the trousers in the wash went he went home. Such an enormous overreaction.", "Yeah for real. Half the world\u2019s population spends a significant part of their life bleeding and somehow now throwing out clothes every month. Good good. Rinse it immediately and wash it. Not a big deal.", "Without nurses a lot more people will die than if assholes are prevented from donating blood. \n\nAnd comparing your work at Walmart to the life saving work nurses do, especially after a pandemic is just laughable."]}
