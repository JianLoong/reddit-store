I've been to this place multiple times and the nurses who work there do a great job and are all really nice whenever I show up. Since it had been a couple of months since my last donation, I scheduled one for today morning.\n\nNormally, as a right-handed person, I donate from my left arm. Plus I've donated from my right arm before, and that hurt a little more than normal, so I stick with my left. Today, the only open seats had the apheresis machines on the right side, so I chose to use my left arm again with the tubes across my lap. Maybe there was a slightly larger risk of the needle getting dragged within my arm as a result, but I figured it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nAfter my donation was done, the apheresis machine made the beeping sound signaling that the final rinseback was done, and so the needle could be removed. Two young nurses, whom I hadn't seen before and so I assumed they were new, didn't notice the machine beeping until maybe 20+ seconds later, and I was getting a little impatient to get the needle out but I didn't say anything in case they may have been busy. They came over after a nurse who was working on someone else asked for me to be helped, and they apologized for not hearing the machine, which I was okay with, though admittedly it did annoy me somewhat.\n\nThen as the nurse on my left side was disconnecting the tubes, I felt the tubes move slightly on my lap, and the needle in my elbow felt kinda differently positioned. Suddenly I noticed the gauze filling up with blood and I exclaimed \"JESUS CHRIST what did you do??\" While it didn't really hurt, I got scared that I could lose a lot of blood. The nurse on my left apologized and acted quickly to get the needle out and clean up the mess, but I was so annoyed after their delayed help that I kinda went ballistic and said \"What the fuck, you can't let this happen!\" A third nurse further away heard me and asked if I was hurt, and I said \"No, but... fucking shit!!\"\n\nThis seemed to render the nurse on my left silent, and she just wrapped a new gauze around my arm without saying anything. Then as she was wrapping up the needle, two drops of blood fell onto my sweatpants, and I got pissed again and said \"Oh great, now you let blood drip on me.\"\n\nAs the two nurses finished up, I started to feel bad about how I acted, and so I said sorry to them. The nurse who was working on the machine to my right said kindly \"That's okay!\" but the other nurse who removed the needle didn't say anything until she handed me the post-donation pamphlet and kinda curtly said \"You know the drill\" beford walking away.\n\nAs I went to get water, I felt like I was really rude and that maybe I should've apologized again, especially since I wasn't in any pain nor did I lose much blood. At the same time, though, I also think that nurse had to be more attentive and careful, even if she may have been new. Did I go too far in my reaction?\n\n**EDIT**: Well, the sub has spoken! I am the AH. And frankly, y'all are 1000% right. I feel awful, that woman didn't deserve such horrid treatment from me. I'll try to give her a gift ahead of Christmas as atonement.\n\nAnd for real, nurses are heroes and it's awful that they endure this kind of abuse that pushes them out of the profession. Thank you for all that you do, and I promise I will never behave this poorly again.

You have all the information about how crossing arms could lead to the needle being improperly placed, and that the nurses ONLY took a little over 20 seconds to respond to the beeping, and apologized for it when they observed your irritation. You knew the likelihood of the needle causing damage was higher, and while I can understand being initially shocked at the sight of yourself bleeding, you were actively being tended to by a professional, and your reaction was inappropriate, considering your familiar with the process.

It would go a long way, especially if you want to continue donating at that location. \n\nNurses make mistakes; they\u2019re people, too.

I have had a nurse mess up the jab two times and on the third blow the vein and led to a massive bruise. While that is error on their part, it would not excuse me cursing at them for it. I can simply ask for another nurse or understand human error. The fact that you went that ballistic of slight shifting that you knew could happen and two drops of blood? That was incredibly excessive. Donating is a great thing, but even the experienced nurses make mistakes, let alone the new ones. You are a good lesson for them on how to stay cool when they get reactive patients.", "YTA.   You were rude.", "YTA. It's great that you do donate. But your reaction was a bit overboard.

You did overreact. You were very rude. And that nurse did not have to accept your apology. Do you act that way at other places ? Like yell at your hairdresser or server at a restaurant? \n\nAnd 2 drops of blood on your pants is not a big deal. Hydrogen peroxide usually takes it right out. Or spray the area with hairspray before you wash it. \n\nBut seriously, find a new donation center and try to keep your inner asshole tucked in", "YTA. That was a wild overreaction, and having to wait 20 seconds?

Freaked me out, but i still managed to not snap at the nurse, who *clearly didnt intend for that to happen*. Yeah, it can be slightly distressing, but you dont even sound like you have a problem with needles or blood- you were just impatient/in a bad mood and snapped at them. \n\nYou were right to apologise, and i dont think youre, like, a terrible person, we all have moments.

They were notified and immediately attended to you. The choice you made where the needle may be an issue due to going across you to the opposite side was an issue and you took the consequences out on the nurses assisting you for a minor mistake that hurt no one- you poor soul how terrible?! Oh my god and while donating platelets a couple drops got on your sweatpants so you yelled at the nurse AGAIN who was helping you\u2026. Hm were you the AH really gotta think long and hard here YTA  and a major one", "YTA.  Healthcare staff is exhausted and leaving the profession in droves.  Thanks for help push them out the door.", "YTA, and your guilt shows that you know it. It is their jobs to help people. From what you described, it sounds like they were with other patients when the machine went off, not just standing around on their phones. You resorted to quite frankly abusive language (and yes, some hospitals and doctors' offices classify swearing to and around their staff as abusive behavior to their staff) for *very* minor problems. You got blood on you, wow. The needle was in your vein and it can be hard to just prevent any blood from spilling on adjacent materials, especially if you have a high heart rate/blood pressure/etc... which you were already getting annoyed/irritated, I bet your heart was pumping harder than it needed to. \n\nYou are almost 30, you need to act like it and not abuse people who are just trying to help people.

Good thing you are not a female...lots of blood and pain. You would have had the vapors. I actually found this very amusing. That being said that is thoughtful of you to donate in the first place.

Was I terrified because it was my first time donating and this just seemed like the worst outcome? Of course. But yelling and wearing at a nurse is just\u2026 oof such a bad look. When I was getting the iv for when I was going into labor a month ago the nurse blew the vein after a single poke and a few draws. Stuff just happens", "For IVs I have the catheter left, but everytime I donate plasma or blood they have to leave the needle in because it's a much bigger gauge then the needle used to start IVs.", "I think that's besides the point.  Terminology aside, the same story still happens", "Believe me, I know nothing I do can make me look good after this, and it would be even more awful of me to try. This is more compensation for her having to put up with my behavior, nothing else.\n\nI was thinking of getting a gift card, nothing extravagant.", "Naw man,  abuses of medical staff is far too common to be swept under the rug. \n\nHe's an adult and should know better. \n\nDoing a good deed doesn't give you a free pass for being an AH.", "> it is completely appropriate to express your concerns\n\nit is completely inappropriate to yell, especially obscenities.", "In which way were these medical professionals not attentive to the patient? The part where it took an ENTIRE 20 seconds to respond to his alarm or the part where his needle got dislodged and they immediately fixed it and cleaned up the small amount of blood? How were they not respectful? Did they cuss him back or tell him to leave or even point out that his behavior was inappropriate?", "In other words , how to tell OP is a guy hahaha", "I'd refuse  to be his nurse", "I would too.", "You'd seriously turn away a life saving donation because the dude said a swear? Jc get over yourself \n\nThe guy was surprised and maybe slightly scared over what he saw maybe an overreaction but completely understandable in the moment. At least he apologized", "You should! I mean that sincerely!", "I'm glad you're reconsidering your reaction and taking responsibility. That matters a lot. You severely overreacted to a non-life-threatening situation and took it out on a nurse who was trying to help you. Learn from this experience and grow and you'll be a better person for it.", "That doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to act like an intimidating belligerent AH.", "Then you are surely the AH.", "Healthcare workers have been treated especially like shit during this pandemic. You were unnecessarily cruel to someone who is trying to save lives. YTA", "I'm glad you were nice. People don't realise that phlebotomy is more of an art than a science. I can get really hard sticks but then get a young guy with veins like a drain pipe and completely blow it. It's normal but people freak out, which is understandable, but if they stay calm it allows us to explain.", "Lmao, do you think my judgement was solely based on this fact? Which is important considering there wasn't a loose needle flopping around and no accidental stab risk making OP's reaction more ridiculous.", "Exactly if he was loud enough for a different nurse to get involved I\u2019m sure it was loud.  Then the extra sarcasm at the end was unneeded.", "Right\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Working on the medical field,  maybe I'm jaded, but you get tired of being verbally berated and in some cases, physically assaulted, stalked, creeper on,  sexually harassed etc and I have 0 tolerance for it anymore. \n\nI'd turn away anyone who can't treat staff with dignity.", "Donating platelets is a great thing to do and might save a life.\n\nThe thing is, though, one individual's contribution isn't going to stop that donation from happening. If a blood bank kicks a customer, there is someone else who will take their place. Unless there are certain causes that they are actively trying to get specific types of donations for, a lot of what they collect doesn't get used. Because some blood types are super common, but not that useful.\n\nOdds are pretty good that this guy isn't a preferred type, and they don't need his platelets that much. If he were, or if his platelets were needed, he'd be getting weekly calls asking him to donate.\n\nHe's filling a seat that someone else would fill, and he verbally assaulted one of the nurses. It's not endangering a life to choose to let someone who is less of an AH fill that seat instead of him.", "No,  but it's kind of a moot point. \n\nI don't think he was concerned about the actual needle,  rather the blood.\n\nOP is absolutely ridiculous.", "I work retail. I get it. BUT Their donation could save a life and likely has already from past donations. Should they be treated differently? No. But to refuse them completely and deny someone else a life saving treatment. That makes YOU the asshole\n\nRefuse a different jackass", "Thanks for commenting on your opinion of which points are moot.\n\nWe'd be lost without your input on the importance of details. Stay strong comment soldier.", "We are not slaves. You do not have the legal right to my services or to donate blood. \n\nI wish to deny myself being abused. Am I not worth it as a human as well?\n\nEdit: >I work retail. I get it.\n\nRespectfully, no you don't. Please tell me the last time you worked 24+ hours in a row driving all over town to treat people that have killed others and pose a serious risk to you. Please tell me the last time you've been alone with a psych pt with nobody else to help you in case they decide to attack you. I'll wait. \n\nAnd aside from emergency services, nobody is entitled to it.  And if you act up with emergency services,  hopefully you get charged and prosecuted.", "He never said in his post he was concerned about the risk of accidental needlestick. So yeah,  I do feel inclined to mention it. \n\nI'm not defending him,  just stating the facts.", "LEGALITY??? Bro you gotta get your head out of your ass. We're talking about saving lives. Who gives af about legal shit\n\nIf you're willing to deny someone donating to SAVE LIVES then fucking quit you don't belong there", "Bless your heart \ud83d\ude4f", "He actually did say in the post that he thought the tubes being across him would make the needle drag more, and then he said that he felt the needle shift when she was taking the catheter out. So, whether or not the needle was there isn't a moot point because his erroneous belief that it was fueled his outburst.", "\"You should be abused because I determine the net value of your suffering is outweighed by giving blood\"\n\nI hope one day you can actually take the value of human suffering at face value and not as a utilitarian concept. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with working a job wanting to be treated as a human with feelings.  We aren't robots.", "Of course you're not robots. Of course you should be treated with decency. BUT this dude had an UNDERSTANDABLE reaction to blood coming out of their body, WHILE A NEEDLE WAS STILL IN IT That would freak anyone out. This guy obviously feels bad about what happened. They apologized. They are not a bad person and would likely be more prepared next time. \n\nTo deny someone who wants to donate because they made a mistake is absolutely disgusting. Maybe if this behavior was a pattern I could understand but this is a one off incident. Your rage is misplaced. Get pissed at the ACTUAL assholes\n\nALSO my argument is mostly about you denying a completely innocent person from life saving treatment. That donation goes somewhere. \n\nIf you can't handle it get tf out", "A lot of nurses are getting tf out, hence why the nursing shortage has reached critical levels. In my region this is at the point where patient safety is at risk.", "Technically there's no needle in the arm at this point.  Just a plastic catheter. \n\nThere's a difference in freaking out and cussing obscenities at the staff. \n\nI'm not enraged. I'm just disgusted at his behavior and it is fully in the right place. \n\nYou complained in antiwork about your retail job yet you haven't left.  Don't people need you to stock? Don't they need you to tag clothes? Just put up with any abuse or frustration and get on with it,  right?\n\nIt isn't just about the end patient. If the fluids aren't collected in a humane or decent way,  then it can't be justified.  Child labor is okay because we need batteries? Sweat shops because we need clothes? You can't justify the means because of the the end result. \n\nIt's actually okay to still want to work and to do so under humane conditions. It isn't all or nothing.  It's okay to speak up for yourself and your coworkers.", "There are other donation centers, he can go to one where he hasn\u2019t verbally abused the staff"]}
