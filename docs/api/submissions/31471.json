Elderberry is gross but I\u2019m convinced it actually does keep sickness at bay, and I\u2019m not usually the non-traditional type. Give it a shot. \n\nThe masks and soap are for when your lovable little gremlin inevitably brings something new home. At the first sign of -itis, start wearing a mask and being extra cautious about washing everyone\u2019s hands all of the time. And of course no sharing food, cups, etc. Masks protect others more than the wearer, but you can\u2019t put a mask on a toddler, and there\u2019s few other circumstances when a sick person will cough and sneeze directly into your face from six inches away repeatedly and with no sign of remorse.\n\nLastly, start to make peace with the fact that despite all of your best efforts, you\u2019re going to be sicker for the next few years than you have been since you were a kid - maybe ever. We all isolated for the better part of a year (for good reason), so our immune systems are at a disadvantage.

A week of hotel rooms is a lot more expensive than him taking a day off work or her. But here is the fun part about science and life. Remember covid?

The reality is that something DOES have to change though. Can you switch daycares? Can your girlfriend get a better paying job so that you both have more flexibility?  As a mom of 3, I literally am out of sick days because my middle child has been sick for 1.5 months due to a viral infection. Her father has her half the time and hasn\u2019t cared for her as he should have, so she comes back to me and gets me sick.. again.

Wow.", "Really glad you were able to talk it out and that this will work out for your situation. Tbh reading this I was mainly concerned about your health/stress levels because that sounds like a huge amount of pressure and your body is showing it.

Quite a few people came out of that with damaged lungs, weaker immune systems which in turn leads to decreased healing time. Stress also decreases healing time.
