You might need to sit her down and explain to her that this is your \u2018me\u2019 time. Ask if her problem is with gaming or that you\u2019re not spending time with or paying attention to her. She could be jealous.\n\nFor context - I\u2019m near 50 and still gaming and guess what, my partner doesn\u2019t care. My partner of 16 years is still gaming and I would never even consider asking him to stop. Heck, my dad is 70 and still enjoys a game of Age of Empires. Do what you enjoy. You ain\u2019t pathetic for that.", "NTA. Gaming is a hobby tons of people of all ages enjoy.  Terrible that your wife is insulting you for this.", "No, NTA\n\nThis nonsense idea that certain things *cough* golf *cough* are for adults and you should be doing those things (even if they don\u2019t bring you joy) is ridiculous. \nWhat makes playing golf any more adult? \nWhat makes collecting hubcaps any more adult? \nWhat makes being a fan of a certain football team and collecting all their memorabilia while watching the games and memorizing the stats like a kid memorizes Pok\u00e9mon, any more adult?", "As a 38 yo mom of 3 who is currently replaying Fallout: New Vegas (literally as I type this) NTA as long as you take care of responsibilities first.", "NTA, peoples hobbies are healthy way to destress and relax. Grown up people (men and women) can collect stamps, build miniature train tracks or tiny doll houses. As long as it makes you happy and your partner should understand the importance of that time.", "As long as you pull your weight around the house NTA\n\nEveryone has an outlet and there is nothing wrong with gaming.  I just spent the weekend playing Skyrim.", "NTA - there is no age limit on joy. We have a limited time on earth and should spend it doing things that we enjoy, no matter how old we are.", "As long as you\u2019re pulling your weight, NTA. It\u2019s good to have hobbies.\n\nI don\u2019t game, but I married someone who does. We\u2019re in our 40s.", "NTA:  I was going to post exactly the same thing as some others as far as you keeping up with your responsibilities at home. My husband and I are in our 40s and my husband games. It gives us both our \u201cquiet time\u201d. I\u2019d also add: would she be happier if you were spending ludicrous amounts of money on a golf club membership or something more \u201cmature\u201d?", "NTA - I\u2019m 34 and have 200+ hours on the PS5. I work 50 hours a week on the low end. I have a boyfriend and a dog. As long as you\u2019re not neglecting your duties to your wife and home, who cares.", "Ugh, your wife sounds like a real buzzkill. Who cares if you're 35 and playing video games? As long as you're not neglecting your responsibilities, game on my dude. NTA.", "NTA. Would she think the same if it were movies or books? You're allowed to have a hobby.", "Most people in their 30\u2019s have been playing video games since the beginning so it\u2019s completely normal", "NTA. Gaming is a hobby like anything else. We don't call people pathetic for watching TV so I don't see the difference.", "Partners should support each other in their hobbies, and yours clearly doesn't. NTA but your wife is.", "NTA just with your age and gaming as a hobby.   \n\n\nSo long as its not hurting your job performance or family life but at least based on your post it sounds as though you are still helping around the house and spending time with family and such so no neglecting your duties as a husband and father.", "NTA-  husband and I in our 40\u2019s and we take turns playing Black OPs .\n\nYour wife needs to lighten up.\n\nWould she rather you be out drinking with the boys or staying home infront of the tv?", "NTA I'm 39f and I play video games about 4 days a week. I go to work, clean the house, do dinner, etc. If I want to play video games to unwind after all of my many adult responsibilities are fulfilled, I'm going to. There's nothing pathetic about it. It's just a way to relax/be entertained. I'd love to know how mindlessly watching TV until bed time is less pathetic. At least video games require you to actively think about what you're doing.\n\nAside from all of that, I would be deeply hurt if my own wife called me pathetic for any reason. Sounds like you have bigger issues than just video games.", "NTA\n\nBro, I'm 51 years old and I'm 46 hours into Baldur's gate.\n\n>I was called pathetic this morning by my wife for being in my 30s and playing call of duty.\n\nThat's just meanspirited.

He's 93.\n\nNTA.  Keep playing and enjoying.  It's a nice harmless hobby, it's fun - why in the world would you stop?", "Hobbies are important for mental health.  \n\nHow are video games any different than the typical dumb crap people do like golf or watching sports all day.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. I'm 41 and I play games every night, and my wife has zero issue with it. As long as you're taking care of your other responsibilities, your free time is yours to do with as you wish. Gaming is a hobby just like watching tv or reading. Your wife is pathetic for criticizing what you love. She's probably just jealous you're enjoying yourself and she's not.", "NTA she belittles you and that is not okay and is likely sexist", "NTA\n\nPlaying video games is a hobby. Your wife\u2019s name calling is out of line. If you are not ignoring your responsibilities then there is no issue here. Your wife doesn't like video games so she thinks it's okay to insult people that do. Not a great look for her.\n\nETA: I don't play video games myself, but know plenty of adults in their 30s that do. Adults with successful careers and well managed lives.", "NTA\n\nI am 31, got 2 kids and I play games and watch anime, My wife also sometime play games with me. I work full time and in my spare time I either go to the gym or play video games. end of the day it's your hobby and she should respect that, if not then tell her to do one.", "Yeah no calling you pathetic is definitely making her the AH. But on the same note I\u2019d ask myself why. Has she always thought of you playing games being a problem or has it surfaced recently? My suggestion would be to try and spend some quality time with your wife, having kids one tends to make them their absolute priority while forgetting that they also have a partner. Try to make her feel like she\u2019s still wanted and maybe she could even join you in your hobby one day.", "NTA\n\nInsulting you as she scrolls through her phone for hours probably..", "NTA- tell her you could go out drinking with your buddies instead, most women do hate video games though lol. I play golf and video games so you should feel good", "How many hours do you spend playing?  Do you also do things with your family on the weekends?  Do you have non-negotiable times that you must play?", "NTA and couple's counselling is perhaps necessary to get your wife to stop verbally abusing you for merely existing.", "NTA assuming you're doing half the work with your wife. There's no age limit for video games. But there's a lot of people who will use video games as a way to basically get out of work, so if she's complaining, maybe just double check that you're actually pulling your weight.", "NTA but why in the hell are you with someone who treats you like garbage? Your wife sounds toxic as fuk. Just because you don't like hallmark movies doesn't means she's a sniveling child for watching them. The crazy controlling mindset some people have is really disgusting.", "NTA that\u2019s grounds for divorce! Judge will side with you!", "No, and you should file for divorce", "NTA\n\nIf you were playing online with 13 year olds then that could be considered a bit pathetic, but if you're just playing for your own enjoyment there's nothing wrong with that.  Gaming has no age limit.  My dad bought an Xbox when he was in his 70s and I plan to be a gamer until my arthritic fingers can no longer hold a gamepad.\n\nYour wife shouldn't be insulting you for enjoying a hobby she obviously doesn't understand.", "INFO: no way to tell if you are TA without a more accurate breakdown of hours here.\n\nObviously the way you present it would be NTA but let's do some rough numbers.\n\nAssume about 8 hours a night for sleep, to be generous we will include getting ready for bed in that time.\n\nWorking full time for 8 hours a weekday is 40 hours.\n\nLeaves you 8 hours per weekday and 16 on weekends.\n\nHow long does football take and how.many days a week? Let's assume 4 hours twice a week for prepping, travelling, practice, and travelling home. Now when you get home are you helping with chores for 4 hours or are you too tired?\n\nIs there a game once a week that also takes up 5+ hours between prep, getting there early, prep time and debriefing plus travel?\n\nSo realistically you now have 3 weekdays and 1.5 weekemd days with the family and doing chores.\n\nIf you are gaming the entirety of 2 of those weekdays and 1-2 of those weekend days per week then yes you are TA. Your spouse is probably frustrated because you think you are pulling your weight but you are not. If you have literally any other hobbies (watching tv, reading, etc) then even more so.\n\nI am not suggesting my breakdown is correct, just illustrating an example.of how you might be TA. It sounds.like there.is at least a real possibility you are underestimating how much more.work your partner is putting into.the household and her frustration is coming out at the hobby that is most onvious and that you could easily reduce without bailing on a commitment to others.", "Yes you are an overgrown teenager if you\u2019re playing video games as a grown man.", "Definitely NTA. Your wife is pathetic for thinking you're too old for video games.", "NTA. Your wife really needs to lighten up.", "NTA.  I'm 40.  My spouse and I buy each other video games as gifts", "NTA. I play. I'm 38. My husband plays, he's over 40. My father-in-law plays, he's 70-something. My husband is in the military and video games are the most popular hobby among soldiers. Lots of A-list actors and celebrities play. A lot of them ended up voice acting in their favorite fanchises. My neighbor, a long-time surgeon, plays by himself and with his grand kids. My brother, an electrical and aerospace engineer plays. My cousin who is an electrical and computer engineer plays. As long as you're not filling every spare moment with gaming at the expense of other responsibilities and relationships, you're fine. If you're half-assing your stuff just to rush to play video games by doing bare minimum, then that's a problem.", "NTA, but it is an unfortunately common sentiment among millennials that adult men playing video games is pathetic. They're seen on the same level as playing with toys. People just don't really get them, it's a hold-over from the 90s imo.", "NTA. I feel like this isn't about playing a video game, and you need to figure out what it's really about.", "NTA, she\u2019s jealous she doesn\u2019t have a fun hobby. My husband is 35, our nightly fun time is him gaming while we find a show or movie to watch before bed. I\u2019d game myself but my eyes get wonky and I end up nauseous after a bit. \nI do tend to be his map and resident lock pick service when he plays Skyrim, he\u2019s texted me when about to sleep and asked for help, I go and pick a master lock and right back to bed!", "I\u2019m 51 playing TOTK.", ">I was called pathetic this morning by my wife for being in my 30s and playing call of duty.\n\nNo, NTA, but there are words for what your wife is though I'll settle for asshole and childish, considering her obsession with \"age appropriate hobbies\" just makes her look like a scared little girl afraid of being perceived as immature.", "NTA. Also what kinda loving wife would call her husband pathetic over a hobby . Sound like hidden resentment", "NTA. It's a hobby, if you're reporting your gaming session durations accurately.\n\nBecause it's your wife, you do need to discuss why she feels that way and if it's going to be a deal-breaker (i.e. divorce) for either of you. You don't want to live with someone who doesn't respect you, but you also don't want to stay with someone who is manipulating you.", "NTA\n\n\nGaming is a hobby equal to any other", "NTA \n\nOh hell no, I still play at 38 and will be playing when I\u2019m 78,  I diagnose cancer for a living and I\u2019m a woman. \ud83d\ude31. Do whatever you need to do for self care, if that means playing some games a couple times a week, then have at er.", "I\u2019m 65 and I still play. You don\u2019t analyze it, just enjoy it.\nAlthough I will admit I could\u2019ve learned 6 languages and built a Saturn 5 rocket with those hours instead.", "NTA. If your wife wants to insult you then you insult her right back. Lets see how she likes it.", "NTA. Im in my 30's and MAKE video games. How is it pathetic to have a hobby? You know what's really pathetic? Looking down on people/making people feel bad for a hobby thats perfectly normal to have.", "so people at a certain age should just stop doing what they love? why??? NTA be confident in what you like. And OP, a person you love shouldn't call you \"pathetic\", I would reevaluate my relationship with her after what she said.", "Super random but I kind of laugh when I people get all bent and twisted about \"why do kids watch OTHER people play video games on streaming or Twitch\"? \n\nHow different is it than watching OTHER people play sports?", "Great game haven\u2019t played that one in a few years.", "What a fantastic game", "Absolutely. She sounds toxic as fuck.", "When you join an online game the people you're shooting could be 13 or 93, it doesn't matter in the slightest. Nothing even remotely pathetic about it.", "Is it a common sentiment among millennials though? Because most millennials I know play video games at least once in a while.", "Yep. My kids do it, and you are absolutely right. It\u2019s no different than watching football, baseball, or NASCAR.", "I agree. I guess I don't know everything about them. But a partner that calls you pathetic for taking part in a hobby you enjoy, isn't truly a partner. OP works full time, and helps take care of the house and kids, they deserve to unwind a bit. Maybe a divorce is dramatic, but I feel like there's something else we're missing.", "To be fair, I never liked that shit either.", "And? You don\u2019t have to like it to accept that it\u2019s no different than other types of entertainment that are acceptable and in the same vein.\n\nI\u2019d rather play a game than watch it be played, but many kids today love to watch streamers. It is what it is."]}
