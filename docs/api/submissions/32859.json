Me and my old lady appreciate it! I'll most likely be the last owner she'll ever have so I try to make her last years great years.\n\nSecond: No bad skin reaction happened thankfully. We started over the food trial and seem to be all good thus far.\n\nThird: my friend agreed to chat over coffee finally. I explained why I was so mad and apologized again. She accepted it and in turn apologized. Based on many suggestions, I cautiously asked if she would be willing to pay for some of the food trial I had \"lost\". She agreed to pay based on what she could afford, which I was more than fine with. Noone is made of money here.\n\nThen I broke down the cost. Folks, she was the one who lost it this time. (For context, my dog's prescription food bag are ~$60 each and we had used a bag and a half at that point.) She called me delusional, claimed I was only using her for money and said again how it \"wasn't a big deal\" and \"all this for some \"allergies?\"\"(Yes she used air quotes) she even said \"if it was this much trouble you should just put her down.\"\n\nLong story short I ended the friendship right there. I told her to not worry about the money or anything, I dont want anything to do with her.\n\nTo put salt on the wound, a few friends confirmed that she joined in a group chat  brainstorming how to make me allergy-free dog treats for xmas(which is, as you may expect,VERY hard to do) and were planning see what snacks I already had at my house. Also, my dog doesn't beg like other dogs because she can't ever tell where/who food smell is coming from in the room. So she stands conveniently (and awkwardly)in the way of peoples conversation until someone decides shes cute enough for a scrap. \n\nAka As many suspected, [the fish thing was intentional ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/aH6JNXEomn)\n\nI sent a message to everyone who attended again apologizing for ending the party and offered to host again, this time explicitly mentioning to please not feed my dog any food no matter how cute she is. Most seemed amenable, others didn't really respond so I guess they're not coming. Which is fine by me. Turns out those that agreed with me also got Bad Vibes from that one friend so it all conveniently made us closer lol. \n\nMy sweet old dog is worth so much more than that friendship. That convo was a few days ago and I already feel a lot better about my circle of friends.\n\nMuch love! \n-W", "created_utc": 1702352638, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gcq9a/update_aita_for_kicking_out_my_friend_and_ending/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Such strange behaviour. I was at a party recently where everyone seemed to really want to feed the host\u2019s dog.

It would really suck to restart again if someone drops a fry on accident, which is so easy to do. Even if someone hadn't done this on purpose I feel like there was a lot of risk to start with. \n\nYour friend was majorly wrong for what she said but you could always be proactive next event. I have had friends kennel or place their dog in another room during parties because their diets are so strict. It stops people from falling for the cute eyes begging for scraps and prevent accidents. If I knew a dropped fry was a $60 bag of food fiasco waiting to happen I would have a hard time relaxing as a guest. Glad she's doing well and hopefully future gatherings go smoothly!", "Good on you. Dont need those toxic harmful people in your life. Doggy comes first\\~", "You controlled yourself very well against someone who suggested killing your dog. Disgusting.\n\nI\u2019m glad your friend group is better off.", "Honestly, I wouldn't have anyone over during the 8-9 week trial.  It's an expensive risk."]}
