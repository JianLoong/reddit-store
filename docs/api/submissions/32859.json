Me and my old lady appreciate it! I'll most likely be the last owner she'll ever have so I try to make her last years great years.\n\nSecond: No bad skin reaction happened thankfully. We started over the food trial and seem to be all good thus far.\n\nThird: my friend agreed to chat over coffee finally. I explained why I was so mad and apologized again. She accepted it and in turn apologized. Based on many suggestions, I cautiously asked if she would be willing to pay for some of the food trial I had \"lost\". She agreed to pay based on what she could afford, which I was more than fine with. Noone is made of money here.\n\nThen I broke down the cost. Folks, she was the one who lost it this time. (For context, my dog's prescription food bag are ~$60 each and we had used a bag and a half at that point.) She called me delusional, claimed I was only using her for money and said again how it \"wasn't a big deal\" and \"all this for some \"allergies?\"\"(Yes she used air quotes) she even said \"if it was this much trouble you should just put her down.\"\n\nLong story short I ended the friendship right there. I told her to not worry about the money or anything, I dont want anything to do with her.\n\nTo put salt on the wound, a few friends confirmed that she joined in a group chat  brainstorming how to make me allergy-free dog treats for xmas(which is, as you may expect,VERY hard to do) and were planning see what snacks I already had at my house. Also, my dog doesn't beg like other dogs because she can't ever tell where/who food smell is coming from in the room. So she stands conveniently (and awkwardly)in the way of peoples conversation until someone decides shes cute enough for a scrap. \n\nAka As many suspected, [the fish thing was intentional ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/aH6JNXEomn)\n\nI sent a message to everyone who attended again apologizing for ending the party and offered to host again, this time explicitly mentioning to please not feed my dog any food no matter how cute she is. Most seemed amenable, others didn't really respond so I guess they're not coming. Which is fine by me. Turns out those that agreed with me also got Bad Vibes from that one friend so it all conveniently made us closer lol. \n\nMy sweet old dog is worth so much more than that friendship. That convo was a few days ago and I already feel a lot better about my circle of friends.\n\nMuch love! \n-W", "created_utc": 1702352638, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gcq9a/update_aita_for_kicking_out_my_friend_and_ending/", "score": 1240, "replies": ["Such strange behaviour. I was at a party recently where everyone seemed to really want to feed the host\u2019s dog.

It would really suck to restart again if someone drops a fry on accident, which is so easy to do. Even if someone hadn't done this on purpose I feel like there was a lot of risk to start with. \n\nYour friend was majorly wrong for what she said but you could always be proactive next event. I have had friends kennel or place their dog in another room during parties because their diets are so strict. It stops people from falling for the cute eyes begging for scraps and prevent accidents. If I knew a dropped fry was a $60 bag of food fiasco waiting to happen I would have a hard time relaxing as a guest. Glad she's doing well and hopefully future gatherings go smoothly!", "Good on you. Dont need those toxic harmful people in your life. Doggy comes first\\~", "You controlled yourself very well against someone who suggested killing your dog. Disgusting.\n\nI\u2019m glad your friend group is better off.", "Honestly, I wouldn't have anyone over during the 8-9 week trial.  It's an expensive risk.", "Honestly I wouldnt have anyone over during the trial -sadly poeple at parties seem to do this all the time. The last one I went to, someone was giggling while letting the host's dog are a paper plate. It made me so mad", "No offense to your friend but WHO feeds dogs at parties? I don\u2019t have a dog but in the society I grew up in, that\u2019s a no-no\u2026you don\u2019t know what the dog is allowed or not allowed to eat\u2014", "You made the right call.

It\u2019s so disrespectful.", "I understand your frustration! I have a dog who has to take allergy shots every month to the tune of 167$ per shot!(she's 70 pounds) she allergic to the outside...literally, we had allergy tests done and she's allergic to all grass and weeds.\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd72 so during winter she's fine, but spring ans summer are HELL.", "I was reading thinking \"oh i'm glad they worked this out!!\" and then", "Firstly, dog tax please! \n\nSecondly, you don't feed a dog without asking 1st, vut they ALSO knew they were on a prescribed diet trial and had reminders about it!\n\nThirdly, the only time a family members dog got food scraps or treats from outside of her owners,god bless her, was at a family bbq for our ma's bday. The dog had cancer which surgery didn't work as it had spread. She was an amazing black lab, getting on in her years. They booked her in to be put to sleep, and spent last couple of weeks on pain meds. This was also like a kinda \"last hurrah\" for her and we all got given permission to feed her scraps (and IIRC she got her own burger!). She had an amazing day, in a bittersweet kinda way.", "Dog tax of old lady please! \ud83d\ude04", "NTA. It\u2019s so annoying when people won\u2019t respect an easy boundary.  I have a neighbor doesn\u2019t have a dog but who likes to pass out dog treats to the local dogs on their morning walks. I asked her very politely to stop giving my dog any because my dog only weighs 6 pounds (chihuahua) and keeping her weight down is difficult because she is a pig and will eat everything.  \n\nThe neighbor stopped giving her treats but will NOT stop the guilt trip.  \u201cSorry, [my dog\u2019s name], You poor thing, I can\u2019t give you a treat because your mommy won\u2019t let me\u201d.  Implying that I\u2019m a mean mommy. Every damn time. \n\nI asked her to cut it out but she seems offended that I won\u2019t let her give my dog a treat, and so __I__ should respect __her__ boundary and let her feed my dog.  Honestly, some people. So annoying.", "I'm so glad your priorities are what they are.  Enjoy your dog.  She sounds lovely.", "Happy end for you, your friends and your doggy.  \nMerry x-mas for everyone", "I have dealt with allergy detection before, and since her dog didn't react to the extra food, she didn't have to start over.   In fact, since her dog didn't react, she then knew fish was acceptable for her dog to eat.\n\nI have no idea why she felt the need to start over.  It sounds like she doesn't understand the detection process.", "I can't believe she suggested you put your dog down! What the hell is wrong with her?", "I've had dogs my entire life. This has never been an issue.", "Doing the Lords work!", "That APPALLED me. I'm allergic to animals and could never have pets.

Former friend, full offense meant, basically went \"I wonder if it's fish? I'm gonna prove it's so silly\" and risked causing great harm to the dog. Who does that?! It's like those people who insist on \"proving\" that allergies aren't a thing and end up sending people to the hospital because yes, Brenda, allergies definitely are a real thing with real consequences.", "I think it must be something based on culture/location, because my Dad's side of the family are all the sort of people who'll feed any nearby dogs a bit of whatever they're eating, even if they've been told not to, because they're sappy and can't say no to the dog. (And we're lucky that that hasn't caused any major issues, as none of the family's dogs have allergies or other issues.) Some people just don't have the concept that \"food I like = bad for pets\" because they grew up giving their dogs scraps and nothing bad happened, so why would it be an issue?", "I have a friend who lost their dog when they were a little kid because their uncle fed it grapes at Christmas.

During parties, I put my cats in my bedroom. One hates strangers and my friends don't often come to my home and the other would snaffle the meat dishes.\n\nIt's arrogance. It's an *I know better* attitude fuelled by disbelief that the animal's owner does, in fact, know what's best for the animal.", "I agree. I would never intentionally feed someone else's dog human food, but I'm clumsy so I've fed many dogs items I was intending to eat myself.", "They said in the original post that it was a group of close friends though, it's not like it was a big party with a heap of acquaintances. I'd trust my close friends not to do something this stupid.", "The original post is linked in the update (the aka link)", "It is stupid to accidentally drop food? They should have put the dog up because the risk of food being dropped while eaten by a bunch of people chatting and goofing around is very high.", "Yeah, I saw that when I read the post and clicked.
