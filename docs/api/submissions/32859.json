Me and my old lady appreciate it! I'll most likely be the last owner she'll ever have so I try to make her last years great years.\n\nSecond: No bad skin reaction happened thankfully. We started over the food trial and seem to be all good thus far.\n\nThird: my friend agreed to chat over coffee finally. I explained why I was so mad and apologized again. She accepted it and in turn apologized. Based on many suggestions, I cautiously asked if she would be willing to pay for some of the food trial I had \"lost\". She agreed to pay based on what she could afford, which I was more than fine with. Noone is made of money here.\n\nThen I broke down the cost. Folks, she was the one who lost it this time. (For context, my dog's prescription food bag are ~$60 each and we had used a bag and a half at that point.) She called me delusional, claimed I was only using her for money and said again how it \"wasn't a big deal\" and \"all this for some \"allergies?\"\"(Yes she used air quotes) she even said \"if it was this much trouble you should just put her down.\"\n\nLong story short I ended the friendship right there. I told her to not worry about the money or anything, I dont want anything to do with her.\n\nTo put salt on the wound, a few friends confirmed that she joined in a group chat  brainstorming how to make me allergy-free dog treats for xmas(which is, as you may expect,VERY hard to do) and were planning see what snacks I already had at my house. Also, my dog doesn't beg like other dogs because she can't ever tell where/who food smell is coming from in the room. So she stands conveniently (and awkwardly)in the way of peoples conversation until someone decides shes cute enough for a scrap. \n\nAka As many suspected, [the fish thing was intentional ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/aH6JNXEomn)\n\nI sent a message to everyone who attended again apologizing for ending the party and offered to host again, this time explicitly mentioning to please not feed my dog any food no matter how cute she is. Most seemed amenable, others didn't really respond so I guess they're not coming. Which is fine by me. Turns out those that agreed with me also got Bad Vibes from that one friend so it all conveniently made us closer lol. \n\nMy sweet old dog is worth so much more than that friendship. That convo was a few days ago and I already feel a lot better about my circle of friends.\n\nMuch love! \n-W", "created_utc": 1702352638, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gcq9a/update_aita_for_kicking_out_my_friend_and_ending/", "score": 3807, "replies": ["Such strange behaviour.

She sounds terrifying, tbh", "Exactly.  The dog is so poorly trained that it's going to go after any human food it can find, so lets have a party and...hope nobody drops anything, or hope nobody puts something down on the coffee table for a minute while they go pee.  And lets not warn them ahead of time.  And lets have an absolutely violent, screaming reaction to people not being able to read my mind.", "Only thing I'll say is please read the original post. This update is to say that the food was not accidentally given to her or dropped on the floor and my dog has never been an issue at events with food before.", "I mean, I've never had issues with telling people no and then respecting what I said. I have good people around me.", "My cats on the same kind of stuff, he has sensitivity to certain proteins so he can only have novel proteins or hydrolyzed food, on top of that he has kidney issues from being an old man. \n\nThe food is expensive yeah but the other option was a repeat of when we found out he had the allergy problem via a three night hospital stay that cost over 10k so ask that shitty ex friend if she would rather pay for that instead.", "OMG, my middle dog is on a prescription hydrolized food, and you are absolutely right that it costs a fortune. My pup is a pretty hefty boy, so he eats an entire pound of dry kibble, plus \u00bc of a can of the canned food, every day! It's $110 for a 25-pound bag, and $56 (I think) for 12 cans, so it costs me about $5.50/day to feed just him. Luckily for my bank account, my other two dogs can eat normal, non-prescription kibble.", "With respect to dropped food, your dog would of eaten it and you would never of known about it.  Which is why having a dog in a food trial around a party with food is a batty idea.", "I read the original post. Accidental or not, it's still not her friends responsibility. \n\nAlso, the original post said fish was fine and OP way overreacted. So what's reading the original post change?", "That's great for you but OP doesn't have the same experience", "An accident is an accident and can be forgiven. This \"friend\" did it intentionally.", "I didn't say they did, I was saying with better people around you, this wouldn't happen. Did I offend you or something lol", "Yea but it\u2019s also really expensive. They\u2019re only suggesting waiting until there isn\u2019t an expensive risk to take", "No? All you said was that it was never an issue for you, without saying anything else lol", "You assumed.", "Look, I wanna give your dog treats. I want to. I'm not gunna arbitrarily decide whatever is fine. I'm gunna ask you for treats to give to your dog. I hope that lady develops a serious soy allergy in her 30s.", "Whenever I went to a certain friend's place for a party, we were all reminded not to feed their Labrador ANYTHING due to health issues. Now, we usually ended up f**ked up in multiple ways due to being young and dumb, yet we NEVER fed the dog any of our food. \n\nI know that if I did and something happened, not only would I feel crushingly guilty, I'd be more than willing to help pay for things to make it right.", "I've known people like this. I don't know if it's narcissism or whatever but they feel like people who make a big deal over things like this are doing it purely for attention. I don't know if they feel like it's taking attention they properly felt entitled to, or they feel they know everything and you must be wrong, or they're just mad because they lack basic human empathy and compassion when they see someone making a fuss over something that inconveniences them. If this is the case, the fish incident wasn't just intentional but done out of spite. \n\nIt's kind of like those people who work in restarurants and purposely don't adhere to allergy guidelines (or worse, add some in) because they don't truly believe a customer is celiac when asking for gluten free food or they've never heard of an obscure allergy and so it must be made up. \n\nAs a person with serious food allergies, I would 100% never be friends with anyone like this. People who don't believe in allergies are a menace to others. \n\nYou did good.", "You chose wisely. NTA", "Omg I KNEW she did it intentionally. What a witch!", "I'm glad the dog is okay. It seems like it really would be best not to host parties until her food trial is done. Any mistake or dropped scrap puts you back at square 1, and no one cares for your dog as much as you. Having her out with people is always a risk.", "I had my dogs over at a friends place and she asked if the dogs could have some pizza and i said sure thinking yeah they sometimes get some leftover crusts\n\nBut she gave them each a slice and i was like \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41 thankfully nobody has any food sensitivities but to me its like wow ppl food is a treat not a whole meal for then lmao", "You did the right thing, someone that callous and dismissive about allergies will always cause trouble because they will always try to prove allergies don't exist. \n\nThat friend is going to kill someone some day trying to prove allergies don't exist.", "Dog tax \ud83d\ude4f", "Read your first post just before this one and wow, so glad you ended it with that friend. My mom had a dog with severe allergies. I'm talking any protein that wasn\u2019t peanut butter would literally cause his insides to swell up and he couldn\u2019t keep food down until it went back down. His bag of food coat roughly $60 as well and we could only get it from the vet, he could never be on normal dog food. I'm sorry your 'friend' did this, and that she was such a jerk by not only feeding your dog deep fried fish but also blowing up upon hearing how expensive the food was. You could have agreed on $20 and been done with it but she got mad that you care about your dog, jeez.\n\nGood luck with your fur baby and your now closer friend group, may your parties be fun and your dog not get scraps from anyone.", "Unfortunately there's just people out there who LOVE to feed dogs and they won't even ask before doing it. I went on an off roading trip with my grandma and a man there took chewed food out of his mouth and shoved it in my dogs before I could even say anything. One of the most disgusting things I've ever seen.", "The only dogs I'll give scraps and treats too without asking, are my best friends dogs who I LIVED WITH for two years and I know how much they are allowed and what foods are safe and not. And most of the time they're happy with an ice cube. (I some how convinced them while I was living there and was doing a lot of the during the day care - I'm disabled - that ice cubes are the best treat ever.) Any other dog? I won't even think about it unless the owner says something like 'you can give them a little bit of bacon\". Same with other peoples cats.", "I also have a senior dog with skin issues. I would have absolutely lost my ever loving shit if someone fed her a treat and ruined a food trial.", "NTA\u2026 I totally understand and empathize with you OP. \n\nI make food for my little 10.5 yr old girl. No one feeds her or touches her without permission. \n\nShe\u2019d take food, but my friends know they would no longer be my friend. My girl won\u2019t let anyone touch her unless I touch them first and put their hand on her to pet. She\u2019s also a service dog, so there are warnings on her vest and collar when we are in public. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened but after the \u201cput her down\u201d comment in the original post, I was on board for euthanizing the friend!", "I was once at a BBQ at a friend\u2019s house where he had made it VERY clear not to give his dog any food. Well, I was getting a hot dog and, literally, tripped over the dog and my entire hot dog hit the ground. Before I could grab it the dog had inhaled it. I felt soooo badly and apologized all over myself. My friend was upset but realized it was an accident.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine purposefully giving out a treat when you were asked not to. The sheer utter gall! You made the right decision to end the friendship.", "When I'm babysitting, I don't even let kids feed their own dogs people food unless the parents have explicitly said it's okay. I take no chances.", "As someone with a dog who has sensitivities, thank you. The only thing she's sensitive to is peanut butter. Which of course is something many dogs love, and is common in treats. She's not allergic, but it gives her liquid diarrhea, which is particularly unpleasant in an 125lb dog. I love my girl so much and don't want to see her suffering and sick over something as stupid as a treat.", "Mine is allergic to *something*, but is on food that helps tons. Drops happen and I accept them, but blatantly feeding her is a huge no no.", "I know! I gasped when I read that.", "He\u2019s have lost his fingers if it were my dog.. you\u2019re way kind!", "Yep.  We put treats out for people to give our dogs, especially when we're trying to help socialize them.\n\nNever would I ever give someone elses dog a treat without explicit permission.  Same thing at my trailer park, walk the dogs, and an 8yr old will ASK first before she gives the dogs a treat.", "I\u2019m a bit confused. Why do you need to start the trial again if the dog had no reaction?", "Hopefully the allergy issue will get worked out with the food trials.  I had a dog on a prescription diet for most of her life and it was $75 a bag for 20 lbs.  She was a 50 lb dog.  The diet food was for bladder stones.  She also had surgery to have stones removed before being put on the special food to stop her from getting more.  It worked, so no more expensive surgery at least.  She had to have urine tests every 3 months though to rule out or treat bladder infections as the stones had damaged her bladder.\n\nI've also had a couple of cats on prescription diets.  They don't eat as much, thankfully.", "Good lord. My 7yo nephew understands that he's not supposed to give my dog any food unless I say it's ok. And he doesn't. I live with him, so he has plenty of opportunity, but so far so good. I'd have ditched the friend too", "Woow \nYeah after the food trial, if it doesn't go well im going to investigate environmental allergens. That test is just so expensive where I live \ud83d\ude13", "Lmaoooo", "The trial period was explicitly told to me by my vet that it would have to be restarted. The point of it is to completely wipe her system of anything other than the prescription dog food, which takes about 8-9 weeks because of the medication she is on. Essentially getting her to a 'control' level.\n\nAfter that we will introduce different foods very slowly to her system. The fish stopped her body from getting to the \"control\" level.\nKind of like if you were counting a bag of beans and then someone distracts you and messes up the count. I'm grateful she had no reaction, but we still have to restart the process.", "Haha I wish I could but im trying to keep everything/one very anonymous. Please trust shes very cute!", "Thanks!", "Exactly what I was thinking as we were talking....Bu I'm glad to know now rather than later what kind of person she is.", "Yeahhh Im gonna go with what my vet says. But I'm glad you and your pets were able to find a sustainable system!", "You and me both!!", "Oof! We do the Purina HA kind and can really only get it from the vet. I cannot waaaaaiiittitt to be off this trial lol", "I guess you have the right to your own opinion. I'm just glad to have my dog safe and my friends on the same accord."]}
