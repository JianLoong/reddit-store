It's definitely not you. \n\nOne piece of advice: stop commenting on their parenting with things like \"he should stay their to learn his lesson.\" That's not your business. Your business is only \"I'm not providing bail money.\"", "NTA.\n\nRight after I turned 16 my mother told me that if I ever got into trouble and got thrown in jail to not expect them to bail me out.\n\nYour nephew made his bed, let him sleep in it.  If his parents want to keep bailing him out and showing him that they'll keep doing it no matter how many times he gets in trouble, let them, it's not on you to bail their kid out of jail for something he did.", "NTA.\n\nI was raised the same way, a \"Get out of Jail Free card\" the first time you get arrested and after that it's on you.\n\nThis kid is a repeat offender and, unfortunately, I think every family has one of those. Either way, family or not, the kid is the one making those choices. Your brother and his wife are making the choices to repeatedly do nothing to hold him accountable and be like, \"Look, you have to understand where this is going to land you.\"\n\nLet the kid gain the fruits of his labor. Eventually he'll be an adult and realize that mommy and daddy aren't going to help him forever.", "NTA. Dad doesn't want any of his kids to work to learn responsibility but he's sure happy to make you work to bail him out. To be honest, I don't care if you would bail out your own kid a thousand times - that's your kid! You are responsible for your kid, you get to discipline your own kid. You are not responsible for your nephew", "NTA. He played a stupid game and got stupid prize.", "NTA. My husband's father told him that if he was ever arrested, definitely call them, they'd come down to the jail and get the scoop. They'd bail him out if they thought it was warranted, but if they thought he \"earned\" his arrest, they'd see him at his arraignment.  DH said that talk kept him out of a LOT of trouble as a teen - he never got himself arrested, and they never had to come down to the jail.", "NTA.  Nephew is in for a rude awakening when he's in for grand theft auto. Good thing dad says he'll never work since it's a basic question on job applications if you've been arrested before.", "NTA - your brother and his wife are the assholes for expecting you to pay for their choices and their poor parenting.  That's their problem, not yours.  \n\nSide note: An auto shop with him in it has a 101% chance of becoming a chop shop.", "NTA They need to get their kid help before it's too late.", "NTA. You know he is going to leave you in the lurch.", "NTA. He will never understand that there are consequences for his behavior if he never faces any. And you're right....the consequences are going to get way worse real soon.", "NTA. If the schmuck is old enough to be charged as an adult then he can lie in his own bed or con someone else into coughing up bail money. It makes one pine for the good old days when parents were held to account for the actions of their minor children.", "NTA wtf? Why should you bear any responsibility for your sibling's miscreant son?", "Nta it isn\u2019t your job to support your brothers kid when he does something illegal, and you provided a well thought out solution to the issue of your brothers kid paying him back with the auto-shop job I cannot fathom how you would be in the wrong.", "NTA\n\nLet his parents find a way to pay his bail if they aren't doing anything to discourage his illegal activities.", "They can bail him out. It's not your job", "NTA. i agree with your position.", "NTA.  Why didn't dad bail him out...again??", "NTA! I showed my dad this and he literally laughed out loud because he did the same thing to me when I was 18! \"Have fun in jail\" CLICK, that's exactly how that conversation went... Mind you I got arrested for protesting with about mmm, 1,500 other people in NYC, herding cats essentially, but he wanted me to know that my actions had consequences. I figured it out and learned that jail suuuuucks. You're doing the right thing by not enabling his behavior, OP. Might be time to go LC for a while.", "NTA.\nSounds like your nephew is a spoiled brat that your brother is enabling. It is not your responsibility to bail him out after countless arrests.\nIf they want to continue to bail him out of trouble then let them. But they should NEVER put that responsibility on you.\n\nIf they can't see the road he's going down will eventually lead to long term prison sentence then that's on them and them alone.\nHis juvie record may not even be sealed with how many offenses he has and that will MOST definitely prevent him from getting an actual job later.", "Why is it your job to bail out your habitual offender nephew instead of the parents?  They do realize that they\u2019re setting him up to be charged as an habitual offender therefore garnering more prison time in the future or either stealing from the wrong person who will be the judge, jury, and executioner?

This kid needs to learn there are serious consequences for his actions. Every action has a consequence whether that consequence be positive or negative. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t cough up $500 just for him to land right back in the same position he\u2019s in currently. If they keep bailing him out of these situations he will learn he can keep doing these awful things without consequences because someone somewhere will get him out of it.", "NTA. He needs to be held accountable because otherwise he won\u2019t learn. He may not learn anyway because he\u2019s being enabled by his parents. Has he been sentenced for previous offences?", "Nta no is a complete sentence. Do give a reason they can use to try and guilt you. Simple no.", "if he doesn't want his kids to work, there wont be any bail money for him after they die", "NTA. The OP is using sound judgement, the old saying that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over & over again & expecting different results, applies.", "I\u2019m not sure why they think you should be involved in this? He is their troubled teen not yours. I\u2019m sure they can\u2019t afford to bail him out any longer but is that really something you ask a family member to do, bail out your child who is repeatedly in trouble and has proven he can\u2019t be trusted? If I wouldn\u2019t do it for my own child, I wouldn\u2019t do it for someone else\u2019s. NTA", "Why didn't your brother want his kids to work?!", "NTA. A smart mind without guidance is a dangerous thing,, Its your money and if your brother doesnt want to bail him out why should that fall on you?", "NTA OP I'm with you. I told my nephew he gets one. One time and I will bail him out, after that he better have money for his own legal bills because nomore from me. Now he is a married Father of 3. He never took the \"one\", always said that my comment made him stop and think if w/e stupid thing he was gonna do was worth using up his one chance. Nothing ever was.\n\nYou sound like a great parent. Ignore your family, they made choices and those choices came with consequences.", "I feel that is reasonable", "Only said that because on my initial no vote they tried to guilt me", "Yup. My mom was very clear \"Make smart choices cause I'm not posting bail. I might call a lawyer in the morning, but you're staying there.\" Needless to say, I made smart choices lol. The idea of languishing in jail for however held no appeal for me. I bet once nephew has to stay there for a bit he might make better choices.", "OP should have handed them over a literal Get out of Jail Free card and walk away.", "Tbh I care about my nephew and have literally taken him in when he gave his parents the slip but I just hope he picks up responsibility before 18 so the shot really doesn\u2019t hit the fan", "I was thinking somewhere like Midas. Literally have paid my nephew several times to change oil and tires since he was 11 and was interested", "I did tell the police station if they could get him with an adult felon trying turn around in life and talk about his experience behind bars while my nephew is waiting for arraignment, that could do it", "They know I care about him and want to use that against me. My brother was always the more spoiled kid and it shows big", "Because it\u2019s $500 now instead of $50 for first offenses. I\u2019d hate to see what bail costs if he steals a Kia on his 18th birthday", "They will still be sealed but this is his last chance before that changes. Im thinking to tell my brother to let me bail him out but on the condition that he moves in with my wife and I. He\u2019s an only child and hates letting his cousins and I down so it would be difficult to take him in but I\u2019m hoping that if that happened, he would benefit from a less enabling home life\n\nI don\u2019t care what my older brother thinks of me because his marriage and my nephew are a result of him knocking up his now wife and then getting married at 19. He would always act like he was the best at everything and our parents spoiled him but even he admits I turned out better than him. If he can eat humble pie once more and let my nephew live with me, I think we\u2019ll be happy with my nephew bettering himself", "This kid could literally go to your neighborhood Midas, get hired, change your oil, tires, headlights, etc and make good money all without going to college and it\u2019s likely less stress than boosting a ride", "I\u2019m trying to tell my brother that if I bail him out, he needs to move into my house until he goes away for college. I\u2019m sick of that enabling household and think my nephew has tons of potential", "Yea, I figured. It's a pretty natural response, but I'm also kinda trying to say, \"Don't get sucked into a debate.\" Any other issues or reasoning brought in by you just take away from the fact that this is fully your decision.", "You're not obligated to say anything.", "Monopoly is my favorite game", "If you think this will help your nephew then talk to him directly. Say you\u2019ll only bail him out if he gets a job to pay you back and help him get one at this place. You\u2019re right that it\u2019s going to continue to be an endless cycle for him and his parents aren\u2019t doing him any favors.", "Is that show Scared Straight)or something like that) still on cable? Sounds like he would be a good candidate", "You\u2019re exactly right. However, he\u2019s being taught at home that he doesn\u2019t have to work and is therefore using his talents for nefarious ends. It\u2019s a shame he is wasting a natural talent. If he keeps on the same path, it won\u2019t end well for him.", "NTA - but it's probably time to go LC with your brother until he learns to respect your boundaries of saying no once.  What an AH."]}
