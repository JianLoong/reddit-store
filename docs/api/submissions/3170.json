I felt like I was framed as cheating wife to my utter surprise and was wondering if you thought that too.\n\nToday I went to spend Thanksgiving with my in-laws. I felt a bit uncomfortable because this week both my husband and I been bickering a bit with my MIL a bit because she has been demanding (not asking)for us to pay for a lot of things in recent weeks. \n\nI arrived and she half-heartedly gave me a hug and I immediately felt the tension. My MIL\u2019s sister even winked at me when this happened (she has never in my 4+ yrs knowing her has winked at me) so I knew something was up.\n\nAnyways we grabbed food and all of the \u201ckids\u201d - hub\u2019s cousin and her husband, my husband, and their family friend and l sat at the dining table and ate. After we ate, the cousin couple went upstairs to nap (as it was her mom\u2019s house) and my husband said he was going to lay down & sleep in the living room and left.\n\nIt was the family friend (male, let\u2019s call him C) and me just at the dining table. We were chatting harmlessly waiting to light the cake for my FIL\u2019s birthday as 1) I did not want to go into the kitchen to where my MIL and her sister were 2) I also felt it was odd to sit quietly next to my husband sleeping 3) I was told by my husband\u2019s cousin that they suspect C may be gay as he has not dated a girl ever in 35 yrs\n\nApparently we talked for over an hour, and I didn\u2019t have my phone with me so I had no idea my husband was texting me to stop talking to C.\n\nMy husband and I did talk about setting guard rails prior to marriage (no 1:1 with opposite sex- which I am completely fine with as I don\u2019t really have male friends as my girls are ride or die) so I get that he could be upset but this was very situational. And he was FURIOUS - like screaming his head off angry on the drive home. Also apparently my MIL was peering in suspicious???\n\nI was totally taken aback because I\u2019m not blood-related to anyone in this house so it\u2019s not like I can comfortably go somewhere and sleep. Everyone left to go sleep but the two non-blood related folks - we just awkwardly sat there talking about peacocks and turkeys and his mom (whom I saw last week) and also my mom because it was a related topic, and my husband was fuming because I was talking about my family/insinuating I was cheating or something. And how he said his mom was peering in probably saw it that way too. And how could I do that at a family gathering?\n\nWas I that wrong? I thought I was being polite by keeping their guest company until the cake and also trying to minimize my contact with the parents yet I\u2019m being treated like some scheming criminal with intentions to cheat.\n\nAITA???\n#advice #aita", "created_utc": 1669334537, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3yj5o/aita_for_talking_with_my_husbands_family_friend/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're out in the open talking to another guest. Wtf is wrong with your husband and his family?", "What's with the guardrails stuff? I'm guessing that was his idea, not yours.

Guard rail about no 1:1 with opposite sex? Husband texting you not to talk to a family friend?

You were two guests socializing at a social event. They were if anything poor hosts. \n\nSuper weird rule by the way.", "NTA - but your little rule about not talking to members of the opposite sex 1:1 is stupid and shows that you both might be a bit insecure in your relationship.  My bride and I have been happily married for 37 years, we\u2019ve never cheated on each other (I mean, for me, I know I haven\u2019t, it\u2019s my assumption that she has been faithful as well b/c she\u2019s never given me a reason to doubt it).  Some of my best friends are women, some of her best friends are men, and I can\u2019t imagine not having the friends we do due to some jealousy issues.

Why would you agree to this? That's the only reason I thought maybe ESH because you literally gave away your free will willingly.

They are gaslighting you into questioning an innocent conversation in a house full of people. I guess he would have preferred it if you just left when everyone else took a nap? These are horrible people. Your husband is a jealous control freak. The quickest way to get me to continue talking to someone? If my hubby yelled at me to stop/forbid it; then I will do it just to spite. \nGood luck, I think you're going to need it because this is your future.", "NTA, but that guardrail is unsustainable and unhealthy.

That's a bit of a red flag right there. \nIt it's a family gathering, or any type of gathering where both you and hubby are present then surely it's assumed there will be some talking/being friendly /networking/whatever you call it.\nNTA but you're either in a really dysfunctional family or being set up.", "NTA.

What were you supposed to do while your husband bounced out of the social event by falling asleep? He messaged you to stop talking to this cousin or whatever but couldn't be bothered to engage with you in the conversation, act as a buffer, or give a natural out after waking up, instead resorting to fuming anger because you found yourself with no one to talk to but a man??? Like you said it was situational and you picked up on animosity from your inlaws and did the best you could under the circumstances. Now you're supposed to be punished for making conversation? His reaction is grossly possessive, toxic even, because you talked to a family member?? If you're going to settle for this kind of cryptic shitty treatment then let him know he needs to be a big boy and stay awake for the entire event.", "NTA but your rules are weird as hell. You should be able to trust each other enough to have conversations with the opposite sex.\n\nAlso, if he cares that much, he could\u2019ve joined you.

I would feel awkward as hell in your situation. No way I would\u2019ve gone to talk to MIL and your hubby just ditched you. What were you supposed to do? Stare out a window for 2 hours sitting beside the other guest without speaking? Hubby and family are ridiculous if they think having small talk is inappropriate.", "I used to work for a marriage counselor and the \u201cno 1:1\u201d rule is often misused. The intention is for married people to not put themselves in isolated situations with the opposite sex so as not to be tempted to cheat or give the appearance of inappropriate behavior. It sounds like you and your husband took it to an extreme that you shouldn\u2019t have and now he\u2019s weaponizing it against you. This is deeply unhealthy and his mother\u2019s behavior sounds toxic too. You were in a public setting and acted as a polite guest and a welcoming family representative. \n\nYou are NTA and you did nothing wrong. But you need to have some serious conversations with your husband (alone or with a counselor) about 1. reasonable and healthy boundaries within your marriage, and 2. boundaries with his mother so her behavior doesn\u2019t cause issues in your marriage.", "NTA your husband has trust issues.", "To me the most concerning thing is your husband's outburst.  It sounds scary and unwarranted.  Even if you are upset with someone it should never be screaming and berating.  Also,  the texting repeatedly is weird. He could have just joined the conversation if it was that big a deal to him. Do not let him get away with treating you like this or it will continue and possibly get worse.", "It's pretty weird and rude for the entire family to leave the while their are guests there, and if your husband had a problem with you talking to the guy alone then why didn't he just come into room and join the conversation?\n\nIt feels like your husband and his family were testing you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it\u2019s odd that you would agree to not talking one on one with the opposite sex before you got married though. If you didn\u2019t want to break that promise though, I would have gone and sat by your husband in the bedroom even if he was sleeping. You could have played on your phone. His family sounds odd though, and no, talking to someone of the opposite gender when you\u2019re married is not cheating.", "NTA. People typically talk with other guests on Thanksgiving. It\u2019s part of the holiday. I also don\u2019t see the issue. Your husband thinks he\u2019s gay, and MIL and her sister were in the next room over. It wasn\u2019t like you were completely isolated. I don\u2019t get why he\u2019s so worried. This transcends reasonable concern. You did nothing wrong by having a conversation with a fellow guest.", "NTA this seems like it was a test or a set up tbh, especially since your husband was awake. And rather than join you to end the one on one situation he decided to text you to stop??? \n\nAlso is there a reason you guys agreed to never be alone with another gender? Like is it cultural/religious or just him being controlling?", "NTA. Is it possible that they set you up? Why didn't your husband get up after you didn't answer?", "Oh wow first NTA\n\nSecond - there is always that one uncle at family dinners who has a nap after - but the whole damn family!?!? That's weird. \n\nThird- your husband AND his mother are seriously messed up. She was actively peering (read secretly checking up/spying/eavesdropping) on your conversation with someone - wtf kind of shit is that?\n\nForth & fifth- you were keeping another guest company - who was there on their own, who the suspect is gay, and you are accused of cheating?? \n\nWtf are you doing there girl? Is this a situation that you want to keep repeating for the rest of your life? Because as someone a little older then you- this will not change!!", "NTA\n\nBut it's hard to solve this issue without undoing this idea that you need this level of \"guard rail\" just so your relationship can function.\n\nI know you both agreed to it, but that doesn't make it sustainable or healthy. When you set the bar for \"cheating\" so insanely low, you put yourself in a position where you have to be constantly scared that you might accidentally step over the line, or your partner might step over the line. Monogamy can be hard, and it often brings up jealousy in people, but adding normal things like \"having a conversation\" to the list of things that must be avoided at all costs, only intensifies that fear and jealousy. It certainly won't protect you from it.\n\nYou can argue with each other about this incident all you want, but you've built your marriage on this fundamental idea that your relationship is so fragile, that even a casual hour long chat with someone will topple the whole thing. That idea is like a crack in the foundation.\n\nETA But to be clear, the fact that he was \"screaming his head off angry\" about this is horrendous. I'm not saying you should definitely rebuild your relationship with him. I would not be in a relationship with someone with that kind of temper. I just didn't want to leave a comment saying you should leave him because I know people get frustrated with that.", "I would say NTA obviously \n\nHowever, you do have an agreement not to speak 1x1 with the opposite sex and you did. I know you say that you don't have a problem with that agreement but this is why it is a serious problem. It means you can't speak with a man in a totally innocent setting without betraying your husband. \n\nYou are actively participating in a controlling misogynistic system that assumes distrust and infantilizes you. You both have such little faith in your marriage that merely talking to someone of the opposite sex is a form of infidelity. Why would you ever agree to that? That was your mistake, whatever moment it was in your marriage when you agreed to this foolish arrangement.", "This is madness. NTA.", "NTA. This was a totally innocent conversation between two guests at a gathering. It's common, very normal. I totally understand the whole 1:1 thing but...you were never actually alone with C. There were other people around. You were both sitting at a common space dining room table waiting for the next event. They are all seriously overreacting. If your husband was that jealous and upset, he should have joined you at the table in conversation instead of texting you nonstop. He didn't even make any sort of physical attempt to steer you away. He just let it build up to a blow out screaming  fit.", "NTA - something is wrong with dear hubby though. Why would he text from 10 steps away instead of just coming in to either keep you company or get you? His family is weird to just dip off and leave you'll sitting there alone as well. Yuck but you are definitely not in the wrong.", "So your husband knows there is tension, leaves you to nap with just his friend and the family member there is tension with, and is mad that you...talked to that friend out in the open?\n\nNTA. But you should ask your husband what you were supposed to do? Were you supposed to go sit in a corner and wait for him to wake up? \n\nAssuming you don't have other issues with your husband. Ask him what he wanted you to do- he knew MIL has issues currently, and as guests in the home, you sat with the other guest while HE left you alone to fend for yourself. \n\nAnd there can be rules in relationships about the opposite sex, but no sane couple has a rule about chatting with a member of the opposite sex at a kitchen table while others are around. Your husband fully needs to get a grip, and if he doesn't want you speaking to men then he doesn't get to leave you alone with one.", "NTA   Now I\u2019m just a stranger on Reddit but it seems to me like your husband is TRYING to cause a rift. Like he was hiding in the livingroom pretending to sleep to try and get you to screw up. Just eavesdropping and not even interjecting only to yell at you as you drive home. It\u2019s just so strange to me. Also is he potentially projecting onto you? Like if the tables were turned and it was him talking to another woman as you oddly slept at a family event, would he keep it PG/appropriate? I\u2019m just speculating but this isn\u2019t cool no matter the reality. You literally did nothing wrong.", "Nta. You talked to a man GASP! Weird rule and you and he should work on jealousy issues. Go to therapy.", "He is projecting on to you.  He is probably cheating", "NTA why was your husband texting you instead of getting off his lazy ass and joining you? How passive/aggressive. Or called out loud to have you come sit with him. Yea it sounds like a set up, or lack of communication. Was your MIL texting him suggesting it was inappropriate? What a bunch of drama queens.", "NTA", "YTA because of this.\n\n>My husband and I did talk about setting guard rails prior to marriage (no 1:1 with opposite sex\n\nRegardless of how i feel about the above arrangement it is one you agreed too and are aware of. So just blatantly disregarding it is the problem here.", "You\u2019re sitting in a family members home, in the dining room, having a conversation with a family friend of the opposite sex, while people were sleeping or in the opposite room.  I don\u2019t know how that is cheating at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour husband was texting you to stop talking to him.  Him, being C, who, in the eyes of your family, is a gay male.  Is your husband allowed to be alone with C in a room??  What if C is interested in your husband, wouldn\u2019t it be disrespectful to you? It\u2019s cool for your husband to be in a room alone with C, who may just want to fuck your husbands brains out.  \n\n\nIf your husband is threatened by an assumably gay man, in a family members home, because you are having a conversation with him, you need to release this is a fucking huge red flag.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n (If he\u2019s your husbands family friend, then he\u2019s your family friend, because you\u2019re part of that family.

Seriously?? You accepted that?", "NTA\n\nWhy is chatting in the middle of their dining room considered as cheating? *slow blink*\n\nAnyone could have joined you guys, the person you married could have chosen to not take a nap and spend some time with you or be a chaperone in the dining room if he is so afraid you are going to jump on the family friend in the dining room, maybe the dining table? Why must he message you instead of just showing up? what kind of passive aggressive shit is this?\n\nEveryone chose to be impolite to the guests.

Yikes. \nNTA.", "NTA god what a minefield you were expected to navigate. Your husband put you in a weird situation. When I go to my husband\u2019s family house, despite me getting along perfectly with his family, he doesn\u2019t leave my side for a second. MIL is just looking to start drama for no reason.", "NTA at all.  That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.  You were inside the home of your in-laws with your MIL in the next room.  Where on earth else were you supposed to go???", "YTA.\n\nYou agreed to a set of rules with your husband, that you wouldn't talk one-on-one with someone of the opposite sex.\n\nNow you have a 1 hour conversation with him and you're coming up with excuses like \"he's probably gay so it doesn't count\" and \"otherwise I'd have to talk to my MIL instead and I don't like her.\"\n\nYou should apologise to your husband for breaking the agreement you set. No excuses. Just an apology.", "Eh, it could come if as suspicious, you could\u2019ve gone and lay with your husband", "They are nice for the most part but these past few weeks were a bit tough :(", "I asked him this too - why couldn\u2019t he just come and grab me? He was literally less than 10 steps away. Or when he was going to lay down, why couldn\u2019t he have been like \u201cwanna go with me?\u201d Or something\u2026 :(", "I know :( I think this way too\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t leave any guest alone so I was so confused how he wasn\u2019t able to see that the situation was very much created. \n\nI fell in love with his child-like spirit and sometimes it bites me like this. Thinking about it more deeply, I think his family has seen a lot of infidelity so maybe they are traumatized :( Idk I do love him and he is mostly a kind and caring person but being treated like a cheat did not feel good today", ":( that\u2019s my point! I am out in the open and they can all hear our conversation topics, so I was honestly shocked to be perceived this way", "Who they told you they think is gay. Clearly you were trying to seduce him in the living room /s.\n\nYour husband had no qualms about leaving you there with him. But apparently you weren\u2019t supposed to talk with someone they felt comfortable inviting?\n\nMaybe you are leaving something out of the story, but otherwise your husband\u2019s behavior is nuts. Why didn\u2019t he just come out of the bedroom to speak to you instead of texting like you were across town on a secret date?\n\nSomething doesn\u2019t add up here.", "It was both of our ideas-we had read it in a premarital book and wanted to protect our marriage. I don\u2019t have too much male friends any way and he\u2019s completely fine with me hanging with my girls so there is no social isolation! I just thought he\u2019s understand it was situational and not like I was going out of my way to talk to a dude", "Exactly. I\u2019ve had thanksgiving at multiple houses and at each house, guests hung out at the dining room table when they didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go (like to clean or nap). Since y\u2019all weren\u2019t napping or cleaning, then you stayed at the table just like the other couple probably would have if they hadn\u2019t gone upstairs to nap. You simply chatted with the only company left.

Thank you so much - you just validated a stranger and she is very very appreciative of your kindness!", "Siding with his mother when she\u2019s being an asshole is a bad trait in a husband.  Getting into a screaming rage over this is significantly worse.\n\nPresumably he has had some weird set of rules about how married women should behave engrained in him by his family.  That or he just thinks OP should be at his beck and call at all times.  Either way, he\u2019s worked himself up to extreme anger over something that should be nothing.  It sounds like OP was being a polite guest to me.\n\nSiding with your mother when she\u2019s being absurd is a red flag to a bad marriage with in-law problems.  The screaming rage is a red flag for worse abuse.  That\u2019s the thing I hope OP takes a long look at.\n\nEdit: I misread the bit about their \u201crule\u201d the first time through.  Yeah, an angry controlling jealous husband.", "I can see why you say that. I will say though he usually is pretty good at defending me and I do love my MIL (idk why she has been excessively demanding lately tho). Today was just so rough and I wanted an objective eye. Thank you for watching out for me though - hope your Thanksgiving was better & lovely!", "Yeah idk what I\u2019m supposed to have done. and haha that\u2019s fair but the rule works for us :) I don\u2019t have many male friends as my girls are my rock - just thought this situation was diff as I wasn\u2019t going out of my way to meet with a dude alone", "We\u2019ve been married for 4 years, and honestly this was the first time this came up. we\u2019re ok with professional, work-related 1:1 as they are truly unavoidable but both of us are very close with our same-gender friends and we do couple dates for other things so it has been very much sustainable for us. Definitely understand it won\u2019t work the same for others - really appreciate you looking out! Hope your Thanksgiving was wonderful", "Thank you for the validation. Idk.. the family friend has known my husband\u2019s family all his life so I guess they treat him more like family than guest? But I\u2019m with you - no matter how long I\u2019ve known someone, a guest is a guest", "We were all there to begin with and they all left to sleep. I didn\u2019t know where else I could go - the kitchen would\u2019ve been uncomfortable because of the whole MIL situation. I guess sitting quietly next to my husband sleeping in the living room was the better choice? But I felt leaving this guest to sit quietly by myself - that seems so rude to me so I just made conversation!", "The funny thing is if anyone had joined us in our convo, it would have been welcomed. apparently  my husband\u2019s family members were walking back and forth suspiciously peering in (to a dining room with no doors lol)", "This seems like people who go to one of those big cult churches where you respect your man 100%, god is #1, and if there is any issue, GOD will fix it.  \n\n\nThey also seem very homophobic because they suspect he\u2019s gay, but gay people can\u2019t exist in gods eye, because it\u2019s sin.", "Sigh I think he preferred me to tell him let\u2019s leave (before doing cake for my FIL\u2019s birthday) than sit with a man talking for an hr.", "We read it in a premarital book as a way to protect our marriage (as emotional boundaries can be hard even married if opposite sex spend time together). We were both on par with it and our best friends are same-gender anyways so it wasn\u2019t a biggie", "Thank you for this advice - will take it to heart! We\u2019ve gotten counseling before and during our marriage but maybe it\u2019s time for another session", "Yes anger issues have always been a concern. He has gotten a lot better though, but I am scared of his outbursts, and hate the person I become before them", "I sincerely hope not. That\u2019s scary", "Fair point - I guess I thought it would be fine since it was very situational and not directly created by us + there would be no attraction whatsoever since we all have known each other (them for 30+ yrs) and me for 4+ yrs", "Funny you say that - last week we ran into C\u2019s mom and she talked about finding a gf for C. I took that as she\u2019s in denial, and my husband took that as he is suddenly not presumed gay (although C is best friends with the cousin and she told me she thinks he is cus in 35 years of C\u2019s life neither she the bff, nor his own mom has ever heard of or seen a girlfriend)", "We read it together in a premarital counseling book as a way to protect the marriage (as emotional boundaries are hard to set if you spend time with the opposite gender) and we were both okay with it! I don\u2019t really have guy friends and my girl friends and I go decades so it wasn\u2019t an issue!", "Idk why, and i really hope not. That would be really scary", "Girl, idk what to do. they are full of quirks as mine also are and I love them for the most part, but I am really really sad that the one person who knows me - my own husband - doesn\u2019t believe it was situational and that I should have just left abruptly to go \u201cspend time with his family\u201d despite my discomfort or sat next to him sleeping after \u201c15 min of talking\u201d. We tried to talk about it but he thinks I\u2019m 100% in the wrong - that everything i\u2019ve written here are excuses and  \u201cwho knows what you\u2019re doing at work?\u201d I guess he doesn\u2019t trust me at all", "I\u2019m so sad because I love him so much. His anger has always been an issue. It has gotten better but it would be a dream to talk through conflict without screaming or outbursts. I can only pray", "I know\u2026I wish he would communicate before the explosion or at least let me know there is a buildup, but knowing him the buildup doesn\u2019t take that long anyways\u2026 I wish he\u2019d see it from this side. It feels like everyone in the world can see some objectivity except him sometimes", "I can understand his side - I just wish he\u2019d see from mine. He thinks I\u2019m 100% in the wrong and says that I should have told him to leave before doing the cake for my FIL (which would never occur to me cus that\u2019d be so rude imo) rather than talk to a man for an hr", "He said I should have tried to talk to my MIL because even though he was uncomfortable he talked to her. Or I should have told him I was uncomfortable and that we should have left before doing the cake for my FIL. Or just talked to C for 15 min and tried to go talk to the 19 y/o (a decade in age apart) cousin on his phone on the sofa. Anything but talking to a man for an hr", "If only he\u2019d see it the way you do, oh stranger on Reddit, then I wouldn\u2019t be crying in the car", "Nope i know he is not. He is a loyal person, just with a hurt past as we all bring our own baggage", "Idk why he didn\u2019t get up. And apparently he called me? I did not hear though (and TMI I recently got an audiology test that said I had perfect hearing, can hear as the \u201cdogs and deer do\u201d) soooo idk", "Thank you for your perspective", "Idk all i can think of is that because he is considered a \u201ckid\u201d - the adult hosts didn\u2019t care, and all the blood-related \u201ckids\u201d went to take a nap (and we are all adults - in 30\u2019s but distinguishing as the kid vs parent generations) lol", "Op didnt say she didnt hear her phone, she said she didnt have it. And it wasnt really 1on1 it was in public at a family gathering anyone could have joined her, her husband could have joined you. Also a no 1 on 1 conversations with the opposite sex rule is insane, you cant reasonably function in the world like that, and you can have opposite sex friends that are just friends.OP, I dont know if you should leave him, only you can know that, but something here needs to change.\n\nAlso NTA", "I respect your perspective. But my phone was inside my jacket which I left by the door. I am not the type of person to be glued to my phone day to day (sometimes idk where it even is) so please don\u2019t accuse me of ignoring my husband\u2019s text. That is disrespectful and something not in my character.", "My instinct is that that rule is unacceptable and anyone trying to enforce it is an asshole.  I\u2019d say the same if OP were holding him to it in some situation.\n\nI\u2019ve honestly never been in a relationship with that rule, so I don\u2019t have an entrenched view on it.  If anyone wants to convince me I\u2019m wrong I\u2019ll read your argument out.", "She didn\u2019t say that.  Husband\u2019s cousin said that.  All peering at them but not a single one said a dam thing or came in to talk to the cousin and OP.  And OP said she didn\u2019t have her phone with her!!", "Lmao why on earth are you defending their weird \"no conversations with the opposite sex\" rule?", "She was sitting at a dining room table and talking to another human being.  What the fuck is suspicious about that?", "He was on a bean bag made for one person\u2026 but yeah I guess I could have laid on the floor of my mother-in-law\u2019s sister\u2019s house", "They\u2019re not nice. They\u2019re shit stirring busy bodies. \n\nNo person in their right mind thinks someone is cheating because they\u2019re talking to someone, in a common space, at a family gathering. Your husband is unhinged. His family is too.", "Or better, he could have helped entertain the invited guest who had been rudely abandoned by the hosts and family. \nNTA OP.", "Why is his reaction so strong? Is he cheating? If he had such energy to text, why did he not come join the conversation? We\u2019re you supposed to be a silent Sam sitting at the table? It would have been rude to leave him by himself.", "Not if yells at you like this, he isn't. He honestly sounds abusive and has gaslit you into thinking his behavior is normal. \n\nI had an hourlong conversation with a man I had only met online in a game. My SO's only comment was that he couldn't believe it had taken us ten years to exchange numbers. Because he trusts me. He knows no matter what another person's intentions are. I will never betray him.\n\nIf your husband doesn't feel the same way, you need to look hard at your relationship. At the very least, counselling for him is in order.", "Honestly the no 1:1 with the opposite sex rule was a red flag for me. It sounds like your husband has a fundamental level of distrust that is not normal in a relationship. That may come from his circumstances before he knew you, but it certainly affects you now. I'm not going to the typical reddit \"dump him\" answer, but you should consider how this will affect your relationship going forward. NTA.", "Y'all should consider couples therapy because his need for these unreasonable guard rails and his reaction here are abnormal and indicate a weird need for control and lack of trust.", "They sound nuts.", "This is controlling and he obviously doesn't trust you to have a cordial conversation. I bet he'd have screamed if you didn't speak to the person.", "He was in the living room ~ 10 steps away. I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t come and get me. He said he heard the entire conversation and said he was mad I talked about my family. C and I were sharing our reflections about family issues in our culture but I guess that topic was seen as too deep? But I\u2019ve been on panels talking about those topics so I can talk to anyone about it.\n\nI wish if he was going to be that upset, he would have had the sense to be like \u201c honey I\u2019m gonna go lay down - wanna come with me?\u201d", "Understood. Maybe I was wrong about the \"leaving him\" part. But the guardrails thing is just weird. I don't think it's healthy.\n\nBut different people (including different authors) have different ideas about marriage. If you're truly happy with the guardrails in general, that's fine. If this is the only time in your marriage you've had difficulty with them, that's also fine. (In my opinion, which is probably not as humble as it should be!) But if it's part of a pattern, or otherwise unsettles you, ponder that some.", "I can't imagine being in a committed relationship with clear trust issues. Can't talk to somebody because they're another \"dude\"? That's unfortunate to hear and I wish you the best. This scenario, definitely NTA imo.", "I mean, you do you, but the reason you\u2019re here is because it\u2019s not working for you either.", "Okay, was just curious. Honestly that's not a particularly healthy rule to hold- those kinds of things nurture a control imbalance and an innate distrust. Not to mention, the rationale isn't very sound. By those parameters, I, a queer person who dates both genders, wouldn't be able to have a conversation with ANYONE, ever again if I followed those rules with my partner. I get very.... not great vibes about your husband and his family. \n\nAt any rate, my judgement is NTA. There's absolutely nothing wrong at all with you having a simple, time-killing conversation with a friendly person at the Thanksgiving dinner table.", "It should have been fine. They sound controlling. You ARE allowed to have friends of the opposite sex.", "Why does C\u2019s sexuality matter so much?  Nobody gives a fuck about who people fuck or how they fuck!", "I\u2019m glad it was a mutual decision- but I think you need to talk about the exact parameters of that agreement cause you two seem to be operating on very different definitions and consequences for it.", "He actually said to you ' who knows what you're doing at work'?!? Um...working.\n\nI work in construction.  A very male dominated industry.  My SO - who I have been with for 15yrs - he had the same insecurities at first too. I said to him- look, this is what I do, I have done this job before knowing you and I will do it once your gone if you feel you can't trust me.that was his shit to deal with and not mine. \n\nI supported him by being my true self and showing him through actions that i am for real.", "That does not seem like a good option at all. Did he mean to tell someone to leave from his parent's house? Is he serious? Why does he feel like you would do that? He wasn't your guest.", "This makes me so sad for you! I want to hug you! Wanna come be single with me in Canada? It\u2019s cold but we can laugh at Reddit and watch funny videos on Instagram \ud83d\udc9c", "Thank you for reading my post thoroughly and for the validation! \u263a\ufe0f I came here knowing people have diverse perspectives so I\u2019m ok with the perspective above, but not okay with misreading and accusing me of ignoring my husband - so thanks for keeping the facts straight!", "I don't agree with the rule personally, but you can't agree to a rule and then play the victim when you're caught not following it.\n\nI've also found it's usually the women in the relationship that set these rules to begin with, so I wouldn't be surprised if OP created the rule because she was the jealous kind, then plays the victim when she's caught breaking her own rule.", "I don't blame them for peering. If you suspect someone is about to commit a crime, you wait and watch, gather evidence first.", "I'm not defending the rule at all. I think the rule is stupid.\n\nBut this is what they agreed to. You can't agree to something and then back out.", "Haha No i know he\u2019s not cheating. He may get angry but is a pure and genuine person. The Silent Sam comment is so funny though! Idk what I should have done. I feel like the best option was quietly sit next to him sleeping rather than socialize?", "Absolutely. Husband must realize the world is co-ed. If a man asks you for directions on the street are you supposed to ignore him? If you work and there's a male coworker you need to interact are you not supposed to? Heck, if you're in the supermarket and need to ask about a product, you can't? If you have children an a male teacher asks you to meet to discuss? I can go on and on.\nIt's insane.", "Thank you for the reasonable answer. I appreciate it", "Definitely am thinking of reaching out for counseling - thank you for your concern! Hope your day went well", "Your husband's reaction is way out of proportion! And the way no one communicated with you in a normal way says to me something weird is going on. But you're not TA at all. You did nothing suspicious!", "I appreciate your perspective! Thank you for looking out - hope your Thanksgiving was lovely!", "Thank you - hope your Thanksgiving was lovely", "He\u2019s worried I\u2019ll be only talking to one guy at work events because I talked to C for that long today. At work events, which are usually dinners, we usually all sit at one table and no one leaves to nap", "Nono Like for me to tell him (my husband) \u201clet\u2019s leave\u201d (me + him) but I didn\u2019t even consider that as an option because we brought the cake for my FIL\u2019s birthday\u2026 it felt disrespectful to leave before celebrating him", "I edited that part out because I misread it.\n\nI stand by the rest of my comment though.\n\nWhy did you agree to this one-on-one rule in the first place?", "They we\u2019re committing a crime only talking about birds and family in plain sight of everyone.", "That would be so weird tho!! Nothing is wrong with talking to someone about peacocks! Lol", "I think he\u2019ll be ok with those situations as long as they weren\u2019t created by me, and if they aren\u2019t like an \u201chour long\u201d - he was really mad about the duration. Said 15 min max", "Nope. You are a strong independent woman. You do not need a man to define you.  \n\nWhen the right person comes along you guys will nicely fit in to each of ours life's. The will not be a huge change-it will just happen", "The next time you\u2019re alone with the dude, set a timer and when it goes off LOUDLY exclaim \u201cI\u2019m sorry!  My husband feels it\u2019s inappropriate for us to speak any longer.\u201d and walk away.", "Lolol.. knowing myself and my husband\u2019s reaction, prob not wise to talk to him more than a hello"]}
