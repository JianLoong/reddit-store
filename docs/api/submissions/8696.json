Quite a few have asked for an update, so I thought I'd make a quick one.\n\nAfter I made the original post, I've spent a bit thinking. I reached out to her friend, trying to get some info about. She didn't wanna say much and told me that I should come over.\n\nI ended up going. Ex and her friend were there, kiddo was at school. Honestly felt completely different than I was expecting to feel. Anyways, she had the other breast removed, quickly found out that it spread out and she was just starting with her therapy. Ex suggested to stay until kid returns. I remember what you guys said, but I just couldn't do it. I stayed, because I just wanted to see. I guess some of you were right about him remembering me, or not. Walks in, says hi, and disappears somewhere (I guess his room?). Walks back after a min and starts staring at me - \".Papa? Papa!\" and runs at me. Ex starts crying out loud, and I tear up, barely holding myself from crying (I don't know if it's because of her crying or because of kiddo remembering). It was a great day.\n\nTo cut it short, I started visiting her 2-3 times a week, but sadly, things were starting to get worse. Seeing her getting weaker and weaker, I decided to go through with the guardianship. Hired a lawyer, did tons of paperwork, interviews, investigation,  and finally found the bio dad. Ex narrowed a list of people, and even without the dna test, you could see from miles that kiddo was a mini version of one of the guys. Both ex's mom & bio dad signed the consent and waiver, but even if they didn't, they probably wouldn't have a chance to make a difference. After two months, judge made his decision and i finally became a legal guardian.\n\nSadly, ex passed away, roughly 3 months ago. After which I started the adoption process, that still goes on. Had 2 court hearings so far, and another one will be in \\~2 weeks. So far, things went well, so hoping for the best.\n\nI know that I missed a lot of details (not sure if it would be important, but also due to the character limit), but I will be answering any questions you guys have, in the comments below.", "created_utc": 1675098659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p82o2/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_adopt_my_dying/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Terrible situation.

I'm happy you got your son. Congrats to you and kiddo.", "Good for you.  I wouldn't have blamed you if you wanted to stay distant during all this, but stepping up and agreeing to be this kid's dad full time is a great thing.  While the circumstances suck, you made a great and respectful decision.\n\nYou are far from being an AH in this story.  My hat to you.", "You\u2019re an amazing man OP. This was entirely your choice to make and you would not have been wrong whatever you decided. I hope you have a wonderful future", "You did the right thing, OP. That little boy is lucky to have you. Take care of yourself, Papa bear.x", "I am sorry you ex passed, but you are an angel and the ex and the kiddo are lucky you are there. You sound like an amazing man and father. This is such a rough situation but you seem to be handling it so well, I am not sure I would have been able to make the same selfless choices as you.\n\nCan I ask how is the kid doing?", "Proud of you Papa. Makes me wanna be a better dad than i already am.", "Good man right here.", "You\u2019ve done a great thing for the kid.  Thank you for thinking of him. He\u2019s going to have a tough time with all of the changes, but he\u2019s got a loving papa.", "I love this so much.", "I'm crying. As one adoptive parents to another, many blessings to you.", "What a heartwarming update. I hope it works out well for you. Despite the hardships, looks like you and your son found your back to each other. It was meant to be.", "Wow. What an amazing human being you are. I would completely understand if you stood by your original decision but this puts my faith back into human society as a whole. \nSorry for your loss but kudos to adopting your son. I think we all hope you have a fabulous life as father and son", "Thanks.\n\nSlightly, but we do go on a shorter trips.", "Good man. This has been rough and you absolutely handled it like a champion. \n\nGood luck and may many good hikes lay ahead of you"]}
