Quite a few have asked for an update, so I thought I'd make a quick one.\n\nAfter I made the original post, I've spent a bit thinking. I reached out to her friend, trying to get some info about. She didn't wanna say much and told me that I should come over.\n\nI ended up going. Ex and her friend were there, kiddo was at school. Honestly felt completely different than I was expecting to feel. Anyways, she had the other breast removed, quickly found out that it spread out and she was just starting with her therapy. Ex suggested to stay until kid returns. I remember what you guys said, but I just couldn't do it. I stayed, because I just wanted to see. I guess some of you were right about him remembering me, or not. Walks in, says hi, and disappears somewhere (I guess his room?). Walks back after a min and starts staring at me - \".Papa? Papa!\" and runs at me. Ex starts crying out loud, and I tear up, barely holding myself from crying (I don't know if it's because of her crying or because of kiddo remembering). It was a great day.\n\nTo cut it short, I started visiting her 2-3 times a week, but sadly, things were starting to get worse. Seeing her getting weaker and weaker, I decided to go through with the guardianship. Hired a lawyer, did tons of paperwork, interviews, investigation,  and finally found the bio dad. Ex narrowed a list of people, and even without the dna test, you could see from miles that kiddo was a mini version of one of the guys. Both ex's mom & bio dad signed the consent and waiver, but even if they didn't, they probably wouldn't have a chance to make a difference. After two months, judge made his decision and i finally became a legal guardian.\n\nSadly, ex passed away, roughly 3 months ago. After which I started the adoption process, that still goes on. Had 2 court hearings so far, and another one will be in \\~2 weeks. So far, things went well, so hoping for the best.\n\nI know that I missed a lot of details (not sure if it would be important, but also due to the character limit), but I will be answering any questions you guys have, in the comments below.", "created_utc": 1675098659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p82o2/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_adopt_my_dying/", "score": 4980, "replies": ["Terrible situation.

I wouldn't have blamed you if you wanted to stay distant during all this, but stepping up and agreeing to be this kid's dad full time is a great thing.

Don't be afraid to lean on the people in your life for help when you need it, and look for support groups for single parents. Also, consider therapy for the little guy. Losing a parent that young is traumatic, and it can't hurt to have a child psychologist on call to help him process things in an age-appropriate way.  \n\nI'm wishing you all the best and all the good things.

I wish you and your son many blessings and future happiness.", "Thank you for sharing this update. While you would have been fully within your rights not to want to take this on, I think it's absolutely the right call that you did.

I wish you both the best and I\u2019m sorry for what you guys have been through and are still going through.", "You didn't listen to others, but you did what you felt to be right for you and the kid. Being a father is not a bl\u00f6d thing -  what your ex did back then was not okay, just erasing you out of each of others life...

And thank you.", "You are a good man, OP.  You stepped up when nobody else did, and when you had no obligation to do so.  You fulfilled a last request.  I consider you a hero.\n\nThat kid has a great role model.

This update just made me cry.", "My dude. I can tell this is my PMS talking but this totally warmed my heart.

I wish you and your son the absolute best.", "Damn, you are a good person.", "You are a rock star. You would not have been ta for not doing this, but you are a hero especially to that little boy for doing it. My oldest is 8 and I cannot imagine dying and not knowing if he would be loved and okay.

You're a stand-up guy for taking on this responsibility.", "I'm really sorry for this situation. That is truly a terrible situation to be in and I can only imagine what she went through in the end. Good on you for stepping up! I hope everything works out!", "Wow. This is insane. I\u2019m so sorry that his mother is no longer around, but that he is in loving hands with you.", "My eyes teared up. Sometimes people are so amazing in their capacity to love. Thank you for being the best of humanity. \n\nIt's obvious and true to say that you are giving a great gift to this child, and I also believe this child will be also be a great gift to *your* life. \n\nI can't help but think that perhaps *this* was the reason you came into their lives in the first place.\n\nI wish you both the very best of everything.\n\nI'm blown away.", "You are a magnificent person OP, the thoughts of a little Fieval calling you papa melted my heart \ud83d\ude2d", "I'm so sorry for your loss.

It may have been a hard decision, but it sounds like you made the right one.", "Good for you before I read this update I clicked on the OP. I was actually thinking how could he not want to accept him. I'm glad you had a change of heart.", "I absolutely hate how the US legal system is just a money mill. They will milk you dry before they finally make the obvious and right decision, and along the way, they will look for ANY excuse to throw the child into the foster care system where he will remain till he's 18 with no hope while they use him like cattle for numbers and funding. It's absolutely appalling that you can go BUY a child in china or India and adopt them with no hassles... but a US child is just another pawn for the rich to get richer at the expense of his identity.", "I'm so sorry she passed away, but so glad you decided to go see her and everything that came of it.
