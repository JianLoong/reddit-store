Quite a few have asked for an update, so I thought I'd make a quick one.\n\nAfter I made the original post, I've spent a bit thinking. I reached out to her friend, trying to get some info about. She didn't wanna say much and told me that I should come over.\n\nI ended up going. Ex and her friend were there, kiddo was at school. Honestly felt completely different than I was expecting to feel. Anyways, she had the other breast removed, quickly found out that it spread out and she was just starting with her therapy. Ex suggested to stay until kid returns. I remember what you guys said, but I just couldn't do it. I stayed, because I just wanted to see. I guess some of you were right about him remembering me, or not. Walks in, says hi, and disappears somewhere (I guess his room?). Walks back after a min and starts staring at me - \".Papa? Papa!\" and runs at me. Ex starts crying out loud, and I tear up, barely holding myself from crying (I don't know if it's because of her crying or because of kiddo remembering). It was a great day.\n\nTo cut it short, I started visiting her 2-3 times a week, but sadly, things were starting to get worse. Seeing her getting weaker and weaker, I decided to go through with the guardianship. Hired a lawyer, did tons of paperwork, interviews, investigation,  and finally found the bio dad. Ex narrowed a list of people, and even without the dna test, you could see from miles that kiddo was a mini version of one of the guys. Both ex's mom & bio dad signed the consent and waiver, but even if they didn't, they probably wouldn't have a chance to make a difference. After two months, judge made his decision and i finally became a legal guardian.\n\nSadly, ex passed away, roughly 3 months ago. After which I started the adoption process, that still goes on. Had 2 court hearings so far, and another one will be in \\~2 weeks. So far, things went well, so hoping for the best.\n\nI know that I missed a lot of details (not sure if it would be important, but also due to the character limit), but I will be answering any questions you guys have, in the comments below.", "created_utc": 1675098659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p82o2/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_adopt_my_dying/", "score": 1288, "replies": ["Terrible situation. Sorry about your loss and I feel so bad for the kid. That\u2019s a lot that\u2019s happened to him in the last few years. Does this change your lifestyle and traveling then?", "This is a good update. I'm happy you got your son. Congrats to you and kiddo.", "Good for you.  I wouldn't have blamed you if you wanted to stay distant during all this, but stepping up and agreeing to be this kid's dad full time is a great thing.  While the circumstances suck, you made a great and respectful decision.\n\nYou are far from being an AH in this story.  My hat to you.", "You\u2019re an amazing man OP. This was entirely your choice to make and you would not have been wrong whatever you decided. I hope you have a wonderful future", "You did the right thing, OP. That little boy is lucky to have you. Take care of yourself, Papa bear.x", "I am sorry you ex passed, but you are an angel and the ex and the kiddo are lucky you are there. You sound like an amazing man and father. This is such a rough situation but you seem to be handling it so well, I am not sure I would have been able to make the same selfless choices as you.\n\nCan I ask how is the kid doing?", "Proud of you Papa. Makes me wanna be a better dad than i already am.", "Good man right here.", "You\u2019ve done a great thing for the kid.  Thank you for thinking of him. He\u2019s going to have a tough time with all of the changes, but he\u2019s got a loving papa.", "I love this so much.", "I'm crying. As one adoptive parents to another, many blessings to you.", "What a heartwarming update. I hope it works out well for you. Despite the hardships, looks like you and your son found your back to each other. It was meant to be.", "Wow. What an amazing human being you are. I would completely understand if you stood by your original decision but this puts my faith back into human society as a whole. \nSorry for your loss but kudos to adopting your son. I think we all hope you have a fabulous life as father and son", "Thanks.\n\nSlightly, but we do go on a shorter trips.", "Good man. This has been rough and you absolutely handled it like a champion. \n\nGood luck and may many good hikes lay ahead of you", "My biggest question is who the fuck is slicing onions around me?\n\nYou're a good man, I'm happy for you but also sorry for your loss.", "r/BestOfRedditUpdates", "Aww. I'm glad you wound up his guardian, not because it was the *right* thing to do, but because you and he felt a connection. It must have dropped your heart to see him run to you. And given his mother comfort. \n\nI wish you a long life being family together, roaminh the world and experiencing stuff.", "You're a good man. A better man then most of us. Best of luck and please love that boy.", "I'm glad you eased back into his life and let him get to know you again before his mom passed away. That probably made things easier for him. You're a good man and I hope you and the kiddo have a wonderful life together.", "You would not have been TA for washing your hands of the whole situation, but you are a big damn hero to your soon to be child.", "What a beautiful update.\nYour boy is lucky to have you in his life. Things won\u2019t be easy. But he will know you did this out of love for him.", "You've done a great thing, and you will continue to be a great papa. \u2764\ufe0f", "You're a good man, OP. I'm sorry for the loss of your ex, cancer is a beast and it's hell to watch someone go through it. You made a very tough decision, but I think your son is exactly where he needs to be. Don't be afraid to lean on the people in your life for help when you need it, and look for support groups for single parents. Also, consider therapy for the little guy. Losing a parent that young is traumatic, and it can't hurt to have a child psychologist on call to help him process things in an age-appropriate way.  \n\nI'm wishing you all the best and all the good things. May you and your child both find peace and happiness.", "I'm so very sorry for your loss OP x", "I'm not crying, you're crying!\n\nOP, what a wonderful thing. I wish you and your son nothing but the best. Thank you for being there for this young man - what a difference in his life you have made, and will continue to make. All best wishes to you both.", "Sperm dad didn't want the child? He just willing signed his rights away? Did he have any idea he had a child?", "I\u2019m sorry that she kept you away from your baby for 2 years. I\u2019m sorry that you both have to go through this complicated process and through losing your ex/his mother. But I am very happy you chose to stand with him even when you could have walked away.", "You made me cry", "My condolences to you & your son.", "Wow, I wanted to cry just reading your update. I'm so sorry that your ex passed away, and for what you've been through. But you're a great person for stepping up to adopt that boy and be his Papa forever! I wish you and your son many blessings and future happiness.", "Thank you for sharing this update. While you would have been fully within your rights not to want to take this on, I think it's absolutely the right call that you did. It was truly baffling to me how many people in the prior thread insisted a child you helped raise for 5 years would barely remember you! It is wonderful that you are providing him with something stable and familiar--and hopefully loving--during such a difficult time. I wish you both the best!", "YTA for making me cry.  Damn upstanding person. \nI hope every plane you go on leaves on time and the seat next to you is always empty. \nI hope that it never rains on your days off unless you explicitly wish for it. \nI hope there is always the exact right amount of cream in your damn coffee.  \nYou freaking not a jerk.  You stupidly good hearted decent human being.  I bet you fart rainbows too.", "HUG!", "Wow, that\u2019s awesome! Congrats on becoming an official father. That\u2019s a very brave thing to do.", "Wow so are you happy? Do you still love the kid?\n\nWhat did bio-dad think? Was he shocked? Did he want to meet your son? That would be weird. \n\nAre you glad you did it?", "Aawwww so sweet, you will make a good dad! So sorry about your ex, glad it worked out for your kid.", "You are one of the greatest people I will have read about today.", "You are a hero.

Better than I think I would\u2019ve been.", "You are a GOOD person.", "\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f", "I feel so sorry for you and the child, but so happy about the reunion between you and the kid. You must have really made an  impact on that child life. I was not expecting him to remember you because he was so young when you and his mother broke up. This story made me tear up. I wish you all the best in the world and hope you and your son will eventually be able to lead happy life's even with everything that has happened in his young life.", "You would not have been and initially were NTA for saying no. But you are amazing for doing this and making sure that kid is loved and cared for. You were the only father he ever knew and did right by him when you didn\u2019t have to. You\u2019re a good person. I wish you both the best and I\u2019m sorry for what you guys have been through and are still going through.", "You didn't listen to others, but you did what you felt to be right for you and the kid. Being a father is not a bl\u00f6d thing -  what your ex did back then was not okay, just erasing you out of each of others life... I'm happy that you found back to each other and now have this bond again. I hope that you get the guardianship! (I traveled with my son, according to his age - and I loved it.)", "You're so bloody lovely \ud83d\udc97", "I don\u2019t think anyone was wrong to give the advice they did, but honestly it looks like things worked out in a terribly sad but beautiful way. It\u2019s really wonderful that her child saw you, remembered you so fondly, and that you got to be there at the end and adopt him.\n\nI\u2019m wish you much luck going into the future.", "So sorry for your, and kiddo's, loss.\n\nIt sounds like you are being the hero he needs. You didnt have to. But you did, and it is working out. \n\nLots of internet kudos.", "You wouldn't be A H if you have decided differently but I have confess I am so happy that you did this. And thank you.", "You are a good man, OP.  You stepped up when nobody else did, and when you had no obligation to do so.  You fulfilled a last request.  I consider you a hero.\n\nThat kid has a great role model.  I hope things go well for you in the future and I am sorry for your loss.", "My dad always told me: \u201cIt takes a good man to raise his kids, and an even greater man to raise someone else\u2019s kids.\u201d\n\nGood on you for making an incredible difference.", "You are a wonderful soul on this planet. Your baby boy will have a good life. Chosen family is so tenderly prescious, and you two chose each other hard! I hope happiness befalls you both over and over again in life.", "You did a good thing, and more importantly, you did it because you wanted to. That little boy may not have his mom anymore, but thanks to you, he still has his Papa. I wish you both the best and I'm sorry about your ex.", "Thank goodness that child has you. This update just made me cry.", "My dude. I can tell this is my PMS talking but this totally warmed my heart. What a lucky little guy in an overall shit situation,  to have a man like you in his life. A lot of others would not. I wish you and your son the absolute best.", "Damn, you are a good person.", "You are a rock star. You would not have been ta for not doing this, but you are a hero especially to that little boy for doing it. My oldest is 8 and I cannot imagine dying and not knowing if he would be loved and okay. You didn't owe them anything but giving her that peace in death was the morally right thing to do. Good for you. Good luck in your life with that sweet kiddo.", " Does this change your lifestyle and traveling then?", "Hey, it\u2019s not a good situation. However it happened, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re with your chosen family. All the best wishes to you.", "It sounds like you were reluctant to take on the responsibility until you saw the child again and you had a change of heart. There is nothing wrong with choosing to, or not to become the guardian. But I'm sure to the child is enthralled that you chose the former. I wish you both a happy future! You're a stand-up guy for taking on this responsibility.", "I'm really sorry for this situation. That is truly a terrible situation to be in and I can only imagine what she went through in the end. Good on you for stepping up! I hope everything works out!", "Wow. This is insane. I\u2019m so sorry that his mother is no longer around, but that he is in loving hands with you.", "My eyes teared up. Sometimes people are so amazing in their capacity to love. Thank you for being the best of humanity. \n\nIt's obvious and true to say that you are giving a great gift to this child, and I also believe this child will be also be a great gift to *your* life. \n\nI can't help but think that perhaps *this* was the reason you came into their lives in the first place.\n\nI wish you both the very best of everything.\n\nI'm blown away.", "You are a magnificent person OP, the thoughts of a little Fieval calling you papa melted my heart \ud83d\ude2d", "I'm so sorry for your loss. You're an incredible person though, and her child won't ever forget you stepping up. I wish you both a lifetime of peace and joy.", "Good for you!", "You are a literal angel. Thank you so much for doing the hard thing, this really touched my heart and gives me faith in the world and people. The boy's life is changed because of you. I wish there were more people like you in the world", "wow. best of luck to you!", "Good on you. AITA has somewhat objective rulings, but they leave no room for mercy or kindness. It may have been a hard decision, but it sounds like you made the right one.", "Good for you before I read this update I clicked on the OP. I was actually thinking how could he not want to accept him. I'm glad you had a change of heart.", "I absolutely hate how the US legal system is just a money mill. They will milk you dry before they finally make the obvious and right decision, and along the way, they will look for ANY excuse to throw the child into the foster care system where he will remain till he's 18 with no hope while they use him like cattle for numbers and funding. It's absolutely appalling that you can go BUY a child in china or India and adopt them with no hassles... but a US child is just another pawn for the rich to get richer at the expense of his identity.", "I'm so sorry she passed away, but so glad you decided to go see her and everything that came of it.  I wish you and your kiddo the best.", "This is why I read AITA. Every once in awhile you come across a gem of a person that restores your faith in humanity. May you and that young one be covered in love and light.", "OP this is the kindest least selfish thing I have EVER SEEN on this subreddit.  Good on you. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter wether or not you\u2019d be the AH. I don\u2019t know you but I\u2019m proud of you. You\u2019re one of the good ones.", "You would have been NTA if you just walked away. You are saint for sticking with it.", "Much love to you and your son OP.

That would be me. Proof: I had to buy one to make stew after my sister's surgery. \n\nNo, sorry. Pranking you. It's all about these feels!", "Absolutely. This story is a great reminder that an NTA judgment about not doing something isn\u2019t the same as a judgment that OP *shouldn\u2019t* do it.", "What an insensitive thing to say, OP really stepped up here and you're going to call him dumb for caring?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
