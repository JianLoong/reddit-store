I have a golden retriever named Nala and she is the sweetest. \n\nI'm Deaf, too. That bit is important. When I moved in, I had a bit of trouble having flashing light doorbells put in and there was a while I had to go without. My friends and family know to give me a call when they drop by instead of ringing the doorbell but unfortunately I have missed many a package this way. \n\nFor some reason, Nala caught onto this. At one point she began letting me know when someone was at the door. She'd do this in multiple ways. If I was in the living room where I can see the front door,  she'd go and paw at the door, or if I was upstairs she'd come and gently headbutt me  to let me know someone's there. It took me a while to catch on to what she was trying to do, though. \n\nAnd now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  \n\nI brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. \n\nThen I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. \n\nShe doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes \"So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?\" \n\nI was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave. She left, but she did message me afterwards saying I was rude as fuck kicking her out after she travelled all the way to see me, and that how else was she supposed to think of my dog with videos like that?", "created_utc": 1678900210, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s2ldr/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_after_she_said_i/", "score": 2086, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nala sounds like a wonderful dog (so smart!) and you sound like an excellent dog parent. Clearly your friend doesn\u2019t know anything about dogs, particularly golden retrievers, who thrive on having \u201cjobs\u201d to do. Good for you for asking your friend to leave after her rude and judgmental comments.", "NTA.  How else is she supposed to think?  how about think that this dog is more than a dog.  Somehow this dog realized that it's owner had a disability and found a way to help with that.  Out of LOVE.  This is actually one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard.  Your friend trying to turn it into some sort of animal exploitation story is twisted and awful.  It speaks volumes that she would immediately go there as opposed to seeing this sweet animal as anything other than a caring friend.  Actually kind of gross.", "NTA.\n\nYeah, she is a judgmental asshole.\n\nDogs love interacting with their owners. Realizing that her actions are actually useful to you and make you happy makes your dog happy. Which is why Nala keeps doing it. \n\nDogs can enjoy things that we consider repetitive and mind-numbing. My neighbor has a dog that can play catch for literally hours. If its human tries to stop, she will place the ball in his hand. If human still refuses to throw, she looks for another human.", "NTA. Dogs love jobs and it's not like you're abusing your dog. Sounds like she loves to be helpful!", "NTA, your friend is so wrong it's funny. Retrievers were created to bring things to their humans, that's what retriever *means*. Since Nola can't pick up the person at your door and bring them to you, she opted for second best option - notifying you and letting you do the actual retrieving. Pat Nola on the head from me and explain to your friend that dogs love to be useful.", "NTA. A lot of dogs actually love working, which is why they're called working dogs.  Also damn has she never heard of a service dog?\n\nYou can decide how you want to move forward with the friendship but I wouldn't.", "INFO: Are you paying the dog a living wage?", "Obviously NTA. Your golden sounds like a sweet baby and will be a much better friend to you than this person! If someone was rude to my dog I\u2019d tell them off too. Also, I\u2019m in a 55k+ member golden retriever group and can\u2019t remember ever seeing one named Nala. Not sure what she\u2019s on about.", "NTA, First, it is a behavior your dog developed on its own and not a result of training. Second, telling you someone is at the door is roommate behavior, not servant behavior. If you were living with a human and they didn't let you know there is someone at the door for you because they didn't want to be your servant that would get pretty tiresome pretty quickly.  Lastly, Service dogs exist because some dogs are really good at it and like what they do. Your friend was rude first so your reaction was proportional.", "It's hard to believe that she could so quickly assume that because she sees one behavior of your dog that is the entire only reason you have the dog. I can't get my head around it.\n\nEven if you had deliberately trained your dog to help you in that way, that wouldn't be bad. Does she think service dogs for the blind are being abused and that their owners have no relationship with their dogs outside of that service?\n\nINFO:  When you say \"I was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave,\" it sounds like what you would say after someone had been judgmental about a lot of things up to that point, but the way you tell the story it's as if she said one weird judgmental thing and you immediately asked her to leave.\n\n1. Was she judgmental about anything else?\n2. As weird as her question was, did you at any point try to answer it?", "NTA. Dogs were bred over who knows how long to help people.", "NTA. Your dog literally taught itself to be your service dog. Dogs want to please. She obviously doesn't know anything about dogs.\n\nAnd if you ever speak with her you can tell her my Nala was a grey and white Himalayan cat.", "NTA\n\nNala learned by herself. Maybe Nala is going to teach herself to ignore certain people at the door.", "NTA\n\nDogs are intelligent and VERY loving creatures, especially towards their owners. Your dog is also one of the most popular when it comes to service animals, so it makes a lot of sense that this behavior came naturally to her. \n\nYou take care of your dog every single day; you are in no way neglecting your dog. She\u2019s found a pattern and was capable of providing a solution. That is really amazing! You didn\u2019t force her to do it, and it wouldn\u2019t be an issue if you did", "NTA. That is adorable. Your dog is so smart. Please pay the dog tax. \ud83d\ude00", "NTA, dogs love being helpful. even if you had deliberately trained her to do this it would be perfectly fine because lots of dogs have \u201cjobs\u201d and work and are happy doing so. Your friend is being overly critical and I don\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t invite her over againz", "NTA. Is Nala a trained service dog? Because it sure sounds like she is. If not, you have a very smart & good dog :) Hopefully she will alert you if there are problems in your house, too. FYI, service dogs are trained to do what Nala is doing. There is no servitude involved here. Just a dog that loves you.", "I\u2019m dogs love to have a purpose, if anything your dog gave itself a job. That\u2019s more than some people do. NTA.", "You're not treating her like a servant, you're treating her like a dog.\n\nIf you were actually treating her like a servant, you'd have to pay her and let her leave at the end of her work shift.", "NTA \n\nLabs and Goldens are wonderful working breads that LOVE to task. Which is why they make such wonderful service dogs. \n\nNala has shown proficiency and could be trained as a wonderful backup to technology in your life. She already trained herself in one area you were having issues. \n\nThat's part of the beauty of a relationship with a dog. Your dog obviously loves you and wants to help you. \n\nI'm sure you give Nala all the pets and cuddles she deserves.", "You're kidding.  Nala sounds like an absolute brilliant badass! She taught herself how to have a job. They LOVE having jobs!\n\nYou are NTA but this alleged friend certainly is. Imagine, virtue signaling outrage because a dog has a job. Bloodhounds and cattle dogs must really chap her ass.", "NTA. Your 'friend' sounds like an unkind person. She made fun of your dog's name and the fact that Nala learned how to assist without being asked or trained to do so. Good for you for kicking her out.", "NTA. Not that your dog is specifically a service dog, but has she never heard of service dogs?!? Nala has picked up alerting you to something you can\u2019t hear, which is something a service dog for someone that is Deaf would do. Such a smart girl! Who\u2019s a good girl? Nala!", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like you and Nala have a wonderful relationship, and your friend is weirdly judgmental.", "NTA - Your friend is an idiot.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely normal behavior for a dog to alert it\u2019s person that someone is at the door, regardless of hearing status. You\u2019re lucky, my German Shepard alerts me by barking at the door as if the Huns were invading. She only stops when I tell her, \u201cwe\u2019re alright, I got this\u201d. Your Nala is very smart and chill!", "Weird judgement for a kickass and loving dog. Sounds like a great companion. Sounds like there was judgement and rude behavior prior to this though?", "NTA. Nala sounds like the goodest girl and you should pay the pet tax!", "Wait until your friend finds out about service dogs... Nala is just a smart girl who learned a very helpful habit! She's doing you a favor. Humans do similar things all the time. If my parents were on the phone and the door rang for a package, I'd bring it in for them. Nala is doing the dog equivalent, more or less. Neither of us are being servants!", "NAH. Your friend needs educating on service dogs and how they do work. Even though Nala isn\u2019t your service dog, she will still do things in place of one so it\u2019s normal for a dog to be treated as such. Kicking her out though was a bit too much.", "Maybe I'm missing something here, but as written it seems like you over-reacted. Apparently your friend made some effort to see you, made an (admittedly awkward) joke and you freaked out. \n\nI'l be generous and vote ESH, but throwing a friend out of your house seems like a disproportionate response.", ">She laughed and thought it was cute.\n\nEven with the \"servant\" comment, your reaction seems oddly defensive.  Maybe she just didn't find it that interesting to sit and look at multiple videos of your dog when she was actually there to visit *you.*\n\nESH, and both of you seem a little weird in how you interact with one another. Maybe just let this friendship go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He was a short little guy so his folks couldn\u2019t always see where he was at, but he couldn\u2019t hear them when they called for him.

If they can help their people they will, and they will be proud of it, \n\nOP's friend is the AH, for sure- whether OP trained the dog or the dog learned on their own, neither is a bad thing.", "Yes, my sister\u2019s pointer just pointed dragonflies when birds weren\u2019t around.  Zero training.  It was just his instinct.  People found it fascinating!", "Let me just toss in here, that working dogs need a job. that's when they're happiest and Naila found her own job. NTA.\n\nETA By working dog I mean the working class type dog not as in service dog. Tho they need their jobs too. Lol", "That\u2019s a Texas sized 10-4.", "I mean, servant isn\u2019t a slave, but also that sounds like a joke? Sounds like OP was not too close to this friend.", "Disservice dog smh", "WOW. GSDs are so loyal and generally very protective of the children they live with. I\u2019m just overwhelmed how many good boys and girls have trained themselves. Very heartwarming.", "And the dog (and cat) do that for you and OP because they care about you!", "Wow!  They are incredible animals, aren\u2019t they?!", "If a herding breed dog wanted to start herding me into keeping my shit together at home (do the laundry! Put it away! Eat a food every day!) that\u2019d honestly be super helpful. Even more so if they could hold things steady bc with my tremor I sure can\u2019t XD", "That is a really great explanation for my old family dog lol.\n\nShe was a German shepherd/corgi mix and she definitely had some herding instinct. But at one point she taught herself to tell us when the laundry was finished. She'd hear the buzzer on the dryer go off and if one of us didn't get up to get the clothes out she would come and get us. I figure the noise probably bothered her and she figured out how to make it stop.\n\nShe was a creature of habit too, and she enforced it \ud83d\ude02. When she heard my dad's work van beeping when he backed it into the driveway, she pestered someone until she got to go out front to say hi. She'd wait on the grass until the engine shut off and then she was at my dad's door waiting for him to get out of the van. She also decided walks didn't count unless my mom walked her. I got home from class one day and she begged me for a walk so I took her. We got back and ran into my dad on the way inside and he's like, \"what are doing? I already walked her since I got home early.\" Then mom got home and the dog was demanding her walk as soon as mom finished eating dinner \ud83d\ude02\n\nShe was a trip lol", "There was someone online I knew who lived in a small duplex, was due to give birth in six months, and found a breeder psycho enough to sell her a Maremma sheepdog. They are pretty hardcore LGDs and their whole job is to protect their herd from predators. Everyone in the group I was in begged her not to but she was hellbent on it.\n\nLast I heard was that the poor thing went nuts without enough stimulation and assigned itself the job of guarding the tree in their yard.", "Teach her to collect up the dirty laundry? Or to tidy up her toys?", "I\u2019m dead \ud83d\udc80", "If anything, it\u2019s abusive not to train your dog. When a dog has no structure, no firmly established boundaries, it gets stressed out. They need to know what they can and cannot do, and most dogs thrive on routine. An undisciplined dog is an anxious dog.", "I had a discussion with her breeder back when I was considering a GSD.  This dog was my first of the breed.  The breeder was pretty pointed that GSDs are rule enforcers.  This particular good girl also tattled on my son anytime he started playing with the water in the bathroom.  I spent a lot of time redirecting him from this obsession, until Rainbow started pitching in.\n\nI really miss that pup.", "Yeah it's hard to tell without being present for both conversations, but I couldn't get worked up about either comment. But having been recently subjected to a lot of discourse about whether or not Hugh Grant was rude to an interviewer at the oscars, I know there are a lot of people out there who find things to be rude that I simply don't.", "I\u2019m sure they would love herding my cats lol", "My friend's old pittie did that!!! Her cat,  too. They saved her life a couple of times!!\n\n>is 100 percent on top of blood sugar changes", "And realize that many dogs LIKE to be helpful to their person.", "This is the best thing I\u2019ve read all week, thank you so much for sharing! \n\n\nOp, NTA. Your dog is a smart sweetheart, ex-friend is a giant asshat.", "That made me cry. Animals are absolutely incredible.", "My cat was definitely my emotional support animal through my struggle with an eating disorder, treatment and recovery.  He always gave me extra snuggles when I was having a hard time and helped keep me grounded at least enough to make sure he had all his needs met and more.", "More like meal planning and washing dishes.", "I had a wolf dog who was more dog than wolf who thrived on training. She was amazing, picked up new commands super quick.", "We have a golden. My dad passed away recently and whenever my mom or I cry, she gets really upset and will do the most outrageous things to get your attention and try to make you smile. I love that dog so much!", "I mean I\u2019m the one to talk. My dog is named Oliver after Oliver and Company. Hell respond to Ollie, Ollie-Bolly, butt-face, pain in my ass, sh*t head,etc. Kinda just depends on how annoying he is that day \ud83d\ude02", "Good example... I don't get the Hugh Grant thing either. Now imagine if he was thrown out of the Oscars because of that interview. That's how I'm currently viewing this post without more info.", "Oh they used to get very frustrated trying to herd my mom's 4 cats \ud83d\ude02 my younger one was very Milo & Otis with the youngest cat. My favorite thing was my pup rounding a corner just for the kitten to fly onto her head like a facehugger and chill there lmao", "That's the leash she can do.", "I\u2019d settle for what I can get!", "That's just too lovely for words. What a great dog! But I'm sorry for your loss", "Fur sure!", "I read it as tongue in cheek and thought it was funny.", "No bones about it!"]}
