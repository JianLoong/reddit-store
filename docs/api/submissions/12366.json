I have a golden retriever named Nala and she is the sweetest. \n\nI'm Deaf, too. That bit is important. When I moved in, I had a bit of trouble having flashing light doorbells put in and there was a while I had to go without. My friends and family know to give me a call when they drop by instead of ringing the doorbell but unfortunately I have missed many a package this way. \n\nFor some reason, Nala caught onto this. At one point she began letting me know when someone was at the door. She'd do this in multiple ways. If I was in the living room where I can see the front door,  she'd go and paw at the door, or if I was upstairs she'd come and gently headbutt me  to let me know someone's there. It took me a while to catch on to what she was trying to do, though. \n\nAnd now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  \n\nI brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. \n\nThen I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. \n\nShe doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes \"So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?\" \n\nI was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave. She left, but she did message me afterwards saying I was rude as fuck kicking her out after she travelled all the way to see me, and that how else was she supposed to think of my dog with videos like that?", "created_utc": 1678900210, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s2ldr/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_after_she_said_i/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nala sounds like a wonderful dog (so smart!) and you sound like an excellent dog parent. Clearly your friend doesn\u2019t know anything about dogs, particularly golden retrievers, who thrive on having \u201cjobs\u201d to do. Good for you for asking your friend to leave after her rude and judgmental comments.", "NTA.  How else is she supposed to think?  how about think that this dog is more than a dog.  Somehow this dog realized that it's owner had a disability and found a way to help with that.  Out of LOVE.  This is actually one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard.  Your friend trying to turn it into some sort of animal exploitation story is twisted and awful.  It speaks volumes that she would immediately go there as opposed to seeing this sweet animal as anything other than a caring friend.  Actually kind of gross.", "NTA.\n\nYeah, she is a judgmental asshole.\n\nDogs love interacting with their owners. Realizing that her actions are actually useful to you and make you happy makes your dog happy. Which is why Nala keeps doing it. \n\nDogs can enjoy things that we consider repetitive and mind-numbing. My neighbor has a dog that can play catch for literally hours. If its human tries to stop, she will place the ball in his hand. If human still refuses to throw, she looks for another human.", "NTA. Dogs love jobs and it's not like you're abusing your dog. Sounds like she loves to be helpful!", "NTA, your friend is so wrong it's funny. Retrievers were created to bring things to their humans, that's what retriever *means*. Since Nola can't pick up the person at your door and bring them to you, she opted for second best option - notifying you and letting you do the actual retrieving. Pat Nola on the head from me and explain to your friend that dogs love to be useful.", "NTA. A lot of dogs actually love working, which is why they're called working dogs.  Also damn has she never heard of a service dog?\n\nYou can decide how you want to move forward with the friendship but I wouldn't.", "INFO: Are you paying the dog a living wage?", "Obviously NTA. Your golden sounds like a sweet baby and will be a much better friend to you than this person! If someone was rude to my dog I\u2019d tell them off too. Also, I\u2019m in a 55k+ member golden retriever group and can\u2019t remember ever seeing one named Nala. Not sure what she\u2019s on about.", "NTA, First, it is a behavior your dog developed on its own and not a result of training. Second, telling you someone is at the door is roommate behavior, not servant behavior. If you were living with a human and they didn't let you know there is someone at the door for you because they didn't want to be your servant that would get pretty tiresome pretty quickly.  Lastly, Service dogs exist because some dogs are really good at it and like what they do. Your friend was rude first so your reaction was proportional.", "It's hard to believe that she could so quickly assume that because she sees one behavior of your dog that is the entire only reason you have the dog. I can't get my head around it.\n\nEven if you had deliberately trained your dog to help you in that way, that wouldn't be bad. Does she think service dogs for the blind are being abused and that their owners have no relationship with their dogs outside of that service?\n\nINFO:  When you say \"I was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave,\" it sounds like what you would say after someone had been judgmental about a lot of things up to that point, but the way you tell the story it's as if she said one weird judgmental thing and you immediately asked her to leave.\n\n1. Was she judgmental about anything else?\n2. As weird as her question was, did you at any point try to answer it?", "NTA. Dogs were bred over who knows how long to help people.", "NTA. Your dog literally taught itself to be your service dog. Dogs want to please. She obviously doesn't know anything about dogs.\n\nAnd if you ever speak with her you can tell her my Nala was a grey and white Himalayan cat.", "NTA\n\nNala learned by herself. Maybe Nala is going to teach herself to ignore certain people at the door.", "NTA\n\nDogs are intelligent and VERY loving creatures, especially towards their owners. Your dog is also one of the most popular when it comes to service animals, so it makes a lot of sense that this behavior came naturally to her. \n\nYou take care of your dog every single day; you are in no way neglecting your dog. She\u2019s found a pattern and was capable of providing a solution. That is really amazing! You didn\u2019t force her to do it, and it wouldn\u2019t be an issue if you did", "NTA. That is adorable. Your dog is so smart. Please pay the dog tax. \ud83d\ude00", "NTA, dogs love being helpful. even if you had deliberately trained her to do this it would be perfectly fine because lots of dogs have \u201cjobs\u201d and work and are happy doing so. Your friend is being overly critical and I don\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t invite her over againz", "NTA. Is Nala a trained service dog? Because it sure sounds like she is. If not, you have a very smart & good dog :) Hopefully she will alert you if there are problems in your house, too. FYI, service dogs are trained to do what Nala is doing. There is no servitude involved here. Just a dog that loves you.", "I\u2019m dogs love to have a purpose, if anything your dog gave itself a job. That\u2019s more than some people do. NTA.", "You're not treating her like a servant, you're treating her like a dog.\n\nIf you were actually treating her like a servant, you'd have to pay her and let her leave at the end of her work shift.", "NTA \n\nLabs and Goldens are wonderful working breads that LOVE to task. Which is why they make such wonderful service dogs. \n\nNala has shown proficiency and could be trained as a wonderful backup to technology in your life. She already trained herself in one area you were having issues. \n\nThat's part of the beauty of a relationship with a dog. Your dog obviously loves you and wants to help you. \n\nI'm sure you give Nala all the pets and cuddles she deserves.", "You're kidding.  Nala sounds like an absolute brilliant badass! She taught herself how to have a job. They LOVE having jobs!\n\nYou are NTA but this alleged friend certainly is. Imagine, virtue signaling outrage because a dog has a job. Bloodhounds and cattle dogs must really chap her ass.", "NTA. Your 'friend' sounds like an unkind person. She made fun of your dog's name and the fact that Nala learned how to assist without being asked or trained to do so. Good for you for kicking her out.", "NTA. Not that your dog is specifically a service dog, but has she never heard of service dogs?!? Nala has picked up alerting you to something you can\u2019t hear, which is something a service dog for someone that is Deaf would do. Such a smart girl! Who\u2019s a good girl? Nala!", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like you and Nala have a wonderful relationship, and your friend is weirdly judgmental.", "NTA - Your friend is an idiot.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely normal behavior for a dog to alert it\u2019s person that someone is at the door, regardless of hearing status. You\u2019re lucky, my German Shepard alerts me by barking at the door as if the Huns were invading. She only stops when I tell her, \u201cwe\u2019re alright, I got this\u201d. Your Nala is very smart and chill!", "Weird judgement for a kickass and loving dog. Sounds like a great companion. Sounds like there was judgement and rude behavior prior to this though?", "NTA. Nala sounds like the goodest girl and you should pay the pet tax!", "Wait until your friend finds out about service dogs... Nala is just a smart girl who learned a very helpful habit! She's doing you a favor. Humans do similar things all the time. If my parents were on the phone and the door rang for a package, I'd bring it in for them. Nala is doing the dog equivalent, more or less. Neither of us are being servants!", "NAH. Your friend needs educating on service dogs and how they do work. Even though Nala isn\u2019t your service dog, she will still do things in place of one so it\u2019s normal for a dog to be treated as such. Kicking her out though was a bit too much.", "Maybe I'm missing something here, but as written it seems like you over-reacted. Apparently your friend made some effort to see you, made an (admittedly awkward) joke and you freaked out. \n\nI'l be generous and vote ESH, but throwing a friend out of your house seems like a disproportionate response.", ">She laughed and thought it was cute.\n\nEven with the \"servant\" comment, your reaction seems oddly defensive.  Maybe she just didn't find it that interesting to sit and look at multiple videos of your dog when she was actually there to visit you.\n\nESH, and both of you seem a little weird in how you interact with one another. Maybe just let this friendship go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If your friend would like to come over to my place to train my dog to *not* react when someone is outside my door, I welcome her to try. Your dog is just using a method of communicating that she has found effective. If it wasn't pawing at the door, your dog would do something. It's sweet that Nala has found something that doesn't make herself anxious.", "NTA. I\u2019d probably send someone away if they insulted my dog//our relationship too. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\n\nMy dad is Deaf. He lived in the country as a kid & would wander around in the fields & stuff. He was a short little guy so his folks couldn\u2019t always see where he was at, but he couldn\u2019t hear them when they called for him. His dog caught on that he couldn\u2019t hear them, so he started jumping up & down next to my dad when they\u2019d call out for him. It let them know where he was at, while also letting my dad know that he was being called for. \n\nDogs are amazing. We do not deserve them.", "NTA. I have a dog. I love my dog. But some dog people are the most judgmental people imaginable", "NTA Dogs love having jobs to do!", "Your friend is ignorant. NTA", "NTA.  Your dog is incredibly smart to pick up on the fact that you have trouble knowing someone is at the door.  Dogs are perfect companions for people with disabilities as they can be trained to help them with everyday tasks.  You take care of your dog, and your dog takes care of you.", "NTA. My dog in our hearing household also informs me of people who come to the door. Nala does it nicely. Your \"friend\" was rude to you and your very perceptive dog.", "INFO: Does Nala knows the stomp song?", "NTA but dog tax is due", "NTA.\n\nYour friend tho kinda is..\n\n\nNala is... A wonderful dog, a best girl and a saint. Amazing and pretty smart dog. Also her behaviour shows just how much she loves and cares about you and that you love and care for her too.", "Nta.  People have gone crazy with humanizing dogs.  I have dogs,  I am that crazy dog person (designed my house with dogs on mind).  But they aren't humans.   All of them like structure and most enjoy tasks.  You can end up with some very mal adjusted dogs if the don't have that structure.   Your dog taught herself how to help you,  which is awesome.   \n\nIgnore the people,   and ignore negative Nancy's", "NTA, wait till she hears about service dogs.", "Fur-st rate comment.", "Yes NTA. OP sounds like a great dog owner. The friend is the one that is not knowledgeable about dogs and it was right to ask her to leave for how they were acting.", "A GSD I had years ago decided she would place herself in the hallway at night.  A little annoying since she was a trip hazard.  Until I realized what she was doing.\n\nAny time my disabled son would get out of bed, she came and woke me.  This choice she made ended up being a huge relief since I didn't have to sleep with one eye open.  Dogs don't sleep the same way humans do so interruptions at night are not as draining on them as they are on humans.  \n\nDogs like to contribute and having responsibilities in the family makes them content and happy.", "What is a pat/USD exchange rate?", "Free rent and food, plus a personal poop picker-upper", "I picked up on that too and assumed this friend has said judgemental things in the past. Because why be done with these two comments and call her judgemental. The friend had to have done this before and OP either makes excuses for the friend or doesn't want to really accept the friend does this. To me, OP NTA but I do wonder if maybe the friend was asking like Nala is a service animal and worded it differently", "I assumed she was talking about the friend giving her grief for naming her dog Nala, since OP's discomfort at that is why she moved to showing a cute video. But it also seems super likely this isn't the only instance of friend being judgy.", "She started out by criticizing OP over the dog\u2019s name. I\u2019d say that was pretty judgmental.", "I can only imagine this friend\u2019s thoughts on service dogs. Ick", "I think the first slight from the friend was talking shit about the dog\u2019s name. Then the friend suggested that she was mistreating her dog, when she was simply appreciating something smart that the dog did to help. \n\nTo me, this sounds like two very rude comments from someone she welcomed into her home. Sure, she didn\u2019t have to kick the friend out, but I wouldn\u2019t want someone to stay in my home who persisted in talking to me like that.", "Yeah honestly it's a little hard for me to read the interaction without the tone and a bit more context.
