I have a golden retriever named Nala and she is the sweetest. \n\nI'm Deaf, too. That bit is important. When I moved in, I had a bit of trouble having flashing light doorbells put in and there was a while I had to go without. My friends and family know to give me a call when they drop by instead of ringing the doorbell but unfortunately I have missed many a package this way. \n\nFor some reason, Nala caught onto this. At one point she began letting me know when someone was at the door. She'd do this in multiple ways. If I was in the living room where I can see the front door,  she'd go and paw at the door, or if I was upstairs she'd come and gently headbutt me  to let me know someone's there. It took me a while to catch on to what she was trying to do, though. \n\nAnd now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  \n\nI brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. \n\nThen I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. \n\nShe doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes \"So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?\" \n\nI was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave. She left, but she did message me afterwards saying I was rude as fuck kicking her out after she travelled all the way to see me, and that how else was she supposed to think of my dog with videos like that?", "created_utc": 1678900210, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s2ldr/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_after_she_said_i/", "score": 1297, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nala sounds like a wonderful dog (so smart!) and you sound like an excellent dog parent. Clearly your friend doesn\u2019t know anything about dogs, particularly golden retrievers, who thrive on having \u201cjobs\u201d to do. Good for you for asking your friend to leave after her rude and judgmental comments.", "NTA.  How else is she supposed to think?  how about think that this dog is more than a dog.  Somehow this dog realized that it's owner had a disability and found a way to help with that.  Out of LOVE.  This is actually one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard.  Your friend trying to turn it into some sort of animal exploitation story is twisted and awful.  It speaks volumes that she would immediately go there as opposed to seeing this sweet animal as anything other than a caring friend.  Actually kind of gross.", "NTA.\n\nYeah, she is a judgmental asshole.\n\nDogs love interacting with their owners. Realizing that her actions are actually useful to you and make you happy makes your dog happy. Which is why Nala keeps doing it. \n\nDogs can enjoy things that we consider repetitive and mind-numbing. My neighbor has a dog that can play catch for literally hours. If its human tries to stop, she will place the ball in his hand. If human still refuses to throw, she looks for another human.", "NTA. Dogs love jobs and it's not like you're abusing your dog. Sounds like she loves to be helpful!", "NTA, your friend is so wrong it's funny. Retrievers were created to bring things to their humans, that's what retriever *means*. Since Nola can't pick up the person at your door and bring them to you, she opted for second best option - notifying you and letting you do the actual retrieving. Pat Nola on the head from me and explain to your friend that dogs love to be useful.", "NTA. A lot of dogs actually love working, which is why they're called working dogs.  Also damn has she never heard of a service dog?\n\nYou can decide how you want to move forward with the friendship but I wouldn't.", "INFO: Are you paying the dog a living wage?", "Obviously NTA. Your golden sounds like a sweet baby and will be a much better friend to you than this person! If someone was rude to my dog I\u2019d tell them off too. Also, I\u2019m in a 55k+ member golden retriever group and can\u2019t remember ever seeing one named Nala. Not sure what she\u2019s on about.", "NTA, First, it is a behavior your dog developed on its own and not a result of training. Second, telling you someone is at the door is roommate behavior, not servant behavior. If you were living with a human and they didn't let you know there is someone at the door for you because they didn't want to be your servant that would get pretty tiresome pretty quickly.  Lastly, Service dogs exist because some dogs are really good at it and like what they do. Your friend was rude first so your reaction was proportional.", "It's hard to believe that she could so quickly assume that because she sees one behavior of your dog that is the entire only reason you have the dog. I can't get my head around it.\n\nEven if you had deliberately trained your dog to help you in that way, that wouldn't be bad. Does she think service dogs for the blind are being abused and that their owners have no relationship with their dogs outside of that service?\n\nINFO:  When you say \"I was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave,\" it sounds like what you would say after someone had been judgmental about a lot of things up to that point, but the way you tell the story it's as if she said one weird judgmental thing and you immediately asked her to leave.\n\n1. Was she judgmental about anything else?\n2. As weird as her question was, did you at any point try to answer it?", "NTA. Dogs were bred over who knows how long to help people.", "NTA. Your dog literally taught itself to be your service dog. Dogs want to please. She obviously doesn't know anything about dogs.\n\nAnd if you ever speak with her you can tell her my Nala was a grey and white Himalayan cat.", "NTA\n\nNala learned by herself. Maybe Nala is going to teach herself to ignore certain people at the door.", "NTA\n\nDogs are intelligent and VERY loving creatures, especially towards their owners. Your dog is also one of the most popular when it comes to service animals, so it makes a lot of sense that this behavior came naturally to her. \n\nYou take care of your dog every single day; you are in no way neglecting your dog. She\u2019s found a pattern and was capable of providing a solution. That is really amazing! You didn\u2019t force her to do it, and it wouldn\u2019t be an issue if you did", "NTA. That is adorable. Your dog is so smart. Please pay the dog tax. \ud83d\ude00", "NTA, dogs love being helpful. even if you had deliberately trained her to do this it would be perfectly fine because lots of dogs have \u201cjobs\u201d and work and are happy doing so. Your friend is being overly critical and I don\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t invite her over againz", "NTA. Is Nala a trained service dog? Because it sure sounds like she is. If not, you have a very smart & good dog :) Hopefully she will alert you if there are problems in your house, too. FYI, service dogs are trained to do what Nala is doing. There is no servitude involved here. Just a dog that loves you.", "I\u2019m dogs love to have a purpose, if anything your dog gave itself a job. That\u2019s more than some people do. NTA.", "You're not treating her like a servant, you're treating her like a dog.\n\nIf you were actually treating her like a servant, you'd have to pay her and let her leave at the end of her work shift.", "NTA \n\nLabs and Goldens are wonderful working breads that LOVE to task. Which is why they make such wonderful service dogs. \n\nNala has shown proficiency and could be trained as a wonderful backup to technology in your life. She already trained herself in one area you were having issues. \n\nThat's part of the beauty of a relationship with a dog. Your dog obviously loves you and wants to help you. \n\nI'm sure you give Nala all the pets and cuddles she deserves.", "You're kidding.  Nala sounds like an absolute brilliant badass! She taught herself how to have a job. They LOVE having jobs!\n\nYou are NTA but this alleged friend certainly is. Imagine, virtue signaling outrage because a dog has a job. Bloodhounds and cattle dogs must really chap her ass.", "NTA. Your 'friend' sounds like an unkind person. She made fun of your dog's name and the fact that Nala learned how to assist without being asked or trained to do so. Good for you for kicking her out.", "NTA. Not that your dog is specifically a service dog, but has she never heard of service dogs?!? Nala has picked up alerting you to something you can\u2019t hear, which is something a service dog for someone that is Deaf would do. Such a smart girl! Who\u2019s a good girl? Nala!", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like you and Nala have a wonderful relationship, and your friend is weirdly judgmental.", "NTA - Your friend is an idiot.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely normal behavior for a dog to alert it\u2019s person that someone is at the door, regardless of hearing status. You\u2019re lucky, my German Shepard alerts me by barking at the door as if the Huns were invading. She only stops when I tell her, \u201cwe\u2019re alright, I got this\u201d. Your Nala is very smart and chill!", "Weird judgement for a kickass and loving dog. Sounds like a great companion. Sounds like there was judgement and rude behavior prior to this though?", "NTA. Nala sounds like the goodest girl and you should pay the pet tax!", "Wait until your friend finds out about service dogs... Nala is just a smart girl who learned a very helpful habit! She's doing you a favor. Humans do similar things all the time. If my parents were on the phone and the door rang for a package, I'd bring it in for them. Nala is doing the dog equivalent, more or less. Neither of us are being servants!", "NAH. Your friend needs educating on service dogs and how they do work. Even though Nala isn\u2019t your service dog, she will still do things in place of one so it\u2019s normal for a dog to be treated as such. Kicking her out though was a bit too much.", "Maybe I'm missing something here, but as written it seems like you over-reacted. Apparently your friend made some effort to see you, made an (admittedly awkward) joke and you freaked out. \n\nI'l be generous and vote ESH, but throwing a friend out of your house seems like a disproportionate response.", ">She laughed and thought it was cute.\n\nEven with the \"servant\" comment, your reaction seems oddly defensive.  Maybe she just didn't find it that interesting to sit and look at multiple videos of your dog when she was actually there to visit *you.*\n\nESH, and both of you seem a little weird in how you interact with one another. Maybe just let this friendship go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He was a short little guy so his folks couldn\u2019t always see where he was at, but he couldn\u2019t hear them when they called for him.

On learning that she started to do it herself, I'd have asked if you were okay with me spoiling rotten such a smart and goodest girl.", "When friends help each is it servitude?", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like your friend is having problems with social interactions, or she is competing with you in some weird way.", "NTA it's insulting to both you and Nala! She was rude as fuck for her attitude.", "What does she think of working dogs then?  NTA, and keep her kicked out.", "NTA. You\u2019re friend is over dramatic and ableist.", "the friend is wrong but kicking them out is a bit of an overreaction. Why not just tell them their comment was wrong and talk about your feelings? why kick them out of your house? Seems dramatic", "NTA, and that is not a friend. Has she never heard of service dogs?", "NTAH, my dog is like a child to me.  Don't let your friend insult Nala.  I'm sure she loves you WAY more than your friend does.", "Your ex-friend is probably one of those crazies who think that the noble animals shouldn't be enslaved but treated as an equal to humans and blah and blah. \n\nShe is also - like many of those crazies - unaware of what a dog is. A group animal, bred for thousands of years to interact with humans, to read their mood and react to it, to bond with us. Do you know that dogs are the only animals to follow our eyes? They have also developed an extra muscle over their eyes to communicate with us (look at that adorable puppy look, or that interested look). A healthy, well balanced dog loves to help its owner. \n\nYour dog is a very bright animal who read your need and because she is bonded to you through love and respect, not through fear, she found a solution for you. Calling her a servant is an insult to your dog. \n\nNow, can we have a picture of your Nala?", "NTA. Also peak hilarity is a dog better understanding basic human decency than a human. Maybe we should rename the concept.", "NTA!!! Your dog sounds awesome!\n\nBut YWBTA, if you don't pay the Dog Tax and share that video of your self- trained doggo in action!", "Lmao op does your friend not know that we domesticated animals to serve us? Police use them to track bad guys, blind people use them to guide them around life, diabetics use them to let them know when their sugars are low/high. Hunters use them to catch food. You use Nala to listen to the door for you. \nIts a dog ffs they get depressed when they dont have a job to do", "NTA. I can't even figure out why you're friend would care what your dog does", "NTA", "I can already see that this is going to get voted down, but OP, YTA.\n\nI can't believe this. You show your friend a couple videos and she gets a misleading impression. She asks you *one* question (alright, two questions, but it's the same question phrased two ways) and you throw her out. You don't even try to answer the question.\n\nIf you were an actual friend you would have at least answered the question and discussed it with her until she understood. All you dog lovers out there: there are people out there who've never had about dogs, and you can't expect them to know anything about them. \n\nOP, if you talk it over with your friend and she still doesn't get it, then you can maybe make a case that she's an asshole. But if she asks you a single question and you throw her out, screw you, some friend you are. YTA.", "Why like a servant? A servant would get paid, and would have a choice. If she want's to be accurate, it would be: like a slave. You owe the dog, and the dog does not get a choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso NAH", "Now I want to see this video so bad!!", "Nala will see you out now..", "OP is paw-sitively NTA", "Take this award, that was great", "I don't know if it's actually just a fantastic urban legend but I love that thing about how doggies in movies get CGI on their tails when they're supposed to be menacing but the doggy is actually so happy to be doing such a good job and is having a great day, their tails just wag and wag!", "Her question sounds like something a child would ask, not an adult.\n\nHas she even met a dog before? When they are so eager to catch a ball or a stick, does she think \"Oh, you are just using the dog as a delivery boy\".", "completely unrelated but now I'm wondering if it would be possible to train a golden to pick up my keys and bring them to me any time I put them somewhere other than where they're supposed to go. ngl that would be pretty useful to me... kind of a moot point since I'm allergic, but still a neat idea! especially for people with ADHD", "She's gonna flip her sh*t when she finds out about service dogs.\n\nNTA and that comment she made was pretty dumb, I don't have dogs but I have 3 cats, 2 of which they always sit at the door when someone its outside, I may need to start paying them for their labor since apparently they are working too lol", "There\u2019s a popular golden retriever on TikTok named Nala, I bet that was enough for her to decide \u201ceveryone\u201d names their golden that", "Good girl (scritch, scritch)!!", "bonus: teach her 'speak'. barking is so grating to hearing ears so u get to unleash her on whoever u want to irritate. and u wont hear a thing", "Minorities are not responsible for other people's ignorance.", "Do you seriously think deaf people have no way of communicating with hearing people? What century did you crawl out from?", "A bit simple in your thinking aren't you", "There's no way you've never heard of sign language. There are over 300 different types of sign language in the world.\n\nLike how did you think OP was able to make it adulthood enough to get a place to live and a job to pay for that home and dog?", "I told my therapist about some things my dog does. She was like \"do you know about service dogs? He acts like one\" and I answered that when I got him he was to old for the exam. I have a lot of physical health issues and CPTSD. My dog trained himself to be a first class emotional support animal (helped me trough many hours of extreme pain) and to do tons of service dog tasks. He warns me when my CPTSD destabilises before I even notice the symptoms, he keeps me in bed when I'm too ill to do anything but want to do it anyways, he lays on my legs or snuggled up to my torso when I have panic attacks, the thing that got him mentioned in therapy is that sudden sounds like the doorbell give me panic attacks and he always get's in my way and tries to snuggle when I try to struggle to the door ASAP, he refuses to walk longer than nessecary to do his business when I'm unwell, the list goes on. I met other animals doing similar things. Back when I was deep in the FOG my cat used to inform me if a person was trustworthy", "I have a herding breed dog and he definitely makes up jobs for himself around the house. Most of these jobs involve bossing around various family members.", "And dogs that need jobs and don\u2019t get them from their humans will often just\u2026 assign themselves jobs. My childhood aussie\u2019s self assigned job was to herd me and my brother around the yard, mostly when we wandered too close to the creek.", "Shame dogs can\u2019t actually do household chores. Would help my executive dysfunction so damn much.", "Damn. Mine just eats ger sister's poops. Where can I teach her that?", "That\u2019s great! I can\u2019t get my dogs to show me where their poop is in the yard, tho I keep asking.", "That\u2019s how my moms border collie is. It does get a little frustrating sometimes when she decides she wants me to run in a different direction and will solve this by running directly in front of me and just stopping. But she doesn\u2019t have sheep yet and she\u2019s trying her absolute hardest.", "My friend brought her dog to the farm where she rides, some of the horses got loose, and doggo starts trying to round them up. Never saw a horse before, but he\u2019s like \u201cI got this.\u201d", "I heat with a wood burning stove. My husky helps me by bringing in small sticks of kindling. I didn't teach her this, she just grabbed a stick one day and followed me into the house with it. I gave her some good pets and told her 'Good Job'. Ever since then she follows me out and brings in wood when I do. She drops it in a pile and always looks so pleased with herself.", "I have seen people who outright refuse training a dog anything because it's \"abuse\"", "My dog washed out of service dog training.  Mainly because he was a rescue from a fight ring.\n\nHe is 100 percent on top of blood sugar changes, PTSD triggers, and pain management. \n\nHe just can't work out of the house. \n\nYour friend is a goofus who needs to learn basics of service animals.", "There's a lovely Reddit thread where a woman's cat made itself her ED support.  Kitty would get between her and the toilet when she was purging, demanding cuddles (and howl like a furry banshee if she locked her out of the bathroom). Then it developed a habit of only eating when she did.  Since she couldn't bear for Kitty to be hungry, she started forcing herself to eat regular meals again.  In her last update, they were both back to a healthy weight!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/z4n0fc/op\\_accidentally\\_trained\\_her\\_cat\\_to\\_be\\_an\\_eating/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/z4n0fc/op_accidentally_trained_her_cat_to_be_an_eating/)", "As a kid who grew up with a heeler I can attest. Nothing like all the kids being herded around because the dog was bored lol", "I know someone whose border collie obsessively stalks the cat around the house. Like, will crouch awkwardly 6 cm away from the cat, staring intently, while the cat is just hanging out. We figure she's definitely trying to herd the cat. \n\nFor the record, the dog gets lots and lots of exercise! Daily hikes, lots of yard time, and she's a sorta pro agility dog. She just also must herd the cat!", "Mine slam their bodies into my knees if they're too excited on walks, which is pure evil lol. I'm about to move and have a bit more space so I'm going to look into a herding ball for them! I really wish I could see how they'd interact with smaller livestock because they'd probably have a blast.", "There's honestly nothing more amazing than seeing working dogs do what they're meant to do! I eventually want to own a home on a reasonable amount of land so that I can get smaller livestock for my pups to engage with.", "> dog fan/lover (strictly platonic)\n\nI don't like that you felt the need for that caveat.", "A couple of weeks after my mum died, I went to my friends house. She's got a dog, a lively female golden retriver whose always been friendly but gets bored with me quickly as I'm just a one trick pony (I just throw the ball, we can't play tug of war). So normally I get 10 minutes of her attention before she goes off to play with someone else. This night i was there, she was at my side all night. When she didn't wanna play catch anymore, she put her head on one of my legs, and just sat there whilst I stroked her. I think she knew I was sad.", "I do love it when they find a way to help without being asked.  The relationship with dogs is just amazing.", "My dog's favorite thing is training. She'll literally come nip me (herding breed, SIGH) when she's bored and wants to work.", "I named my Siberian Lunasa.  She also answers to Luna, Nasa, Sasah-Sasah, Nasa-pisa-pasa-pup and Princess.", "Yes Charlie is one of the top right now. \n\nI always pick common names too, my most unique dog name I've had was Levi lol.", "I've seen Nala for a Dane or two as well, never met a golden named Nala and I worked at a dog groomer lol", "Yes I've seen a pitbull named Nala. But still, very uncommon name in general. Probably not on the top 100 right now (some common names have dropped too, like I don't see Max nearly as much anymore).", "Plus extra treats!", "I'm not the op.
