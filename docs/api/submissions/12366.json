I have a golden retriever named Nala and she is the sweetest. \n\nI'm Deaf, too. That bit is important. When I moved in, I had a bit of trouble having flashing light doorbells put in and there was a while I had to go without. My friends and family know to give me a call when they drop by instead of ringing the doorbell but unfortunately I have missed many a package this way. \n\nFor some reason, Nala caught onto this. At one point she began letting me know when someone was at the door. She'd do this in multiple ways. If I was in the living room where I can see the front door,  she'd go and paw at the door, or if I was upstairs she'd come and gently headbutt me  to let me know someone's there. It took me a while to catch on to what she was trying to do, though. \n\nAnd now, even though I  have my doorbell installed she still does it. I did not teach her how to do any of this. She just decided to help me out lol.  \n\nI brought a friend over for the first time recently. This is the first time she's met Nala as well. The first thing she comments on is how I named her Nala, because  apparently everyone and their grandma names their golden Nala. Lion King was my favorite movie growing up, sue me. \n\nThen I showed her a video of Nala pawing at the door because it got a bit awkward after that comment. It's usually a great ice breaker. She laughed and thought it was cute. I showed her another one. She asked me why Nala was doing that and I explained. \n\nShe doesn't say anything for a minute and then goes \"So, she's basically your servant? Is she just here to get the door?\" \n\nI was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave. She left, but she did message me afterwards saying I was rude as fuck kicking her out after she travelled all the way to see me, and that how else was she supposed to think of my dog with videos like that?", "created_utc": 1678900210, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s2ldr/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_after_she_said_i/", "score": 499, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nala sounds like a wonderful dog (so smart!) and you sound like an excellent dog parent. Clearly your friend doesn\u2019t know anything about dogs, particularly golden retrievers, who thrive on having \u201cjobs\u201d to do. Good for you for asking your friend to leave after her rude and judgmental comments.", "NTA.  How else is she supposed to think?  how about think that this dog is more than a dog.  Somehow this dog realized that it's owner had a disability and found a way to help with that.  Out of LOVE.  This is actually one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard.  Your friend trying to turn it into some sort of animal exploitation story is twisted and awful.  It speaks volumes that she would immediately go there as opposed to seeing this sweet animal as anything other than a caring friend.  Actually kind of gross.", "NTA.\n\nYeah, she is a judgmental asshole.\n\nDogs love interacting with their owners. Realizing that her actions are actually useful to you and make you happy makes your dog happy. Which is why Nala keeps doing it. \n\nDogs can enjoy things that we consider repetitive and mind-numbing. My neighbor has a dog that can play catch for literally hours. If its human tries to stop, she will place the ball in his hand. If human still refuses to throw, she looks for another human.", "NTA. Dogs love jobs and it's not like you're abusing your dog. Sounds like she loves to be helpful!", "NTA, your friend is so wrong it's funny. Retrievers were created to bring things to their humans, that's what retriever *means*. Since Nola can't pick up the person at your door and bring them to you, she opted for second best option - notifying you and letting you do the actual retrieving. Pat Nola on the head from me and explain to your friend that dogs love to be useful.", "NTA. A lot of dogs actually love working, which is why they're called working dogs.  Also damn has she never heard of a service dog?\n\nYou can decide how you want to move forward with the friendship but I wouldn't.", "INFO: Are you paying the dog a living wage?", "Obviously NTA. Your golden sounds like a sweet baby and will be a much better friend to you than this person! If someone was rude to my dog I\u2019d tell them off too. Also, I\u2019m in a 55k+ member golden retriever group and can\u2019t remember ever seeing one named Nala. Not sure what she\u2019s on about.", "NTA, First, it is a behavior your dog developed on its own and not a result of training. Second, telling you someone is at the door is roommate behavior, not servant behavior. If you were living with a human and they didn't let you know there is someone at the door for you because they didn't want to be your servant that would get pretty tiresome pretty quickly.  Lastly, Service dogs exist because some dogs are really good at it and like what they do. Your friend was rude first so your reaction was proportional.", "It's hard to believe that she could so quickly assume that because she sees one behavior of your dog that is the entire only reason you have the dog. I can't get my head around it.\n\nEven if you had deliberately trained your dog to help you in that way, that wouldn't be bad. Does she think service dogs for the blind are being abused and that their owners have no relationship with their dogs outside of that service?\n\nINFO:  When you say \"I was thoroughly done with her judgmental ass by that point and I just asked her to leave,\" it sounds like what you would say after someone had been judgmental about a lot of things up to that point, but the way you tell the story it's as if she said one weird judgmental thing and you immediately asked her to leave.\n\n1. Was she judgmental about anything else?\n2. As weird as her question was, did you at any point try to answer it?", "NTA. Dogs were bred over who knows how long to help people.", "NTA. Your dog literally taught itself to be your service dog. Dogs want to please. She obviously doesn't know anything about dogs.\n\nAnd if you ever speak with her you can tell her my Nala was a grey and white Himalayan cat.", "NTA\n\nNala learned by herself. Maybe Nala is going to teach herself to ignore certain people at the door.", "NTA\n\nDogs are intelligent and VERY loving creatures, especially towards their owners. Your dog is also one of the most popular when it comes to service animals, so it makes a lot of sense that this behavior came naturally to her. \n\nYou take care of your dog every single day; you are in no way neglecting your dog. She\u2019s found a pattern and was capable of providing a solution. That is really amazing! You didn\u2019t force her to do it, and it wouldn\u2019t be an issue if you did", "NTA. That is adorable. Your dog is so smart. Please pay the dog tax. \ud83d\ude00", "NTA, dogs love being helpful. even if you had deliberately trained her to do this it would be perfectly fine because lots of dogs have \u201cjobs\u201d and work and are happy doing so. Your friend is being overly critical and I don\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t invite her over againz", "NTA. Is Nala a trained service dog? Because it sure sounds like she is. If not, you have a very smart & good dog :) Hopefully she will alert you if there are problems in your house, too. FYI, service dogs are trained to do what Nala is doing. There is no servitude involved here. Just a dog that loves you.", "I\u2019m dogs love to have a purpose, if anything your dog gave itself a job. That\u2019s more than some people do. NTA.", "You're not treating her like a servant, you're treating her like a dog.\n\nIf you were actually treating her like a servant, you'd have to pay her and let her leave at the end of her work shift.", "NTA \n\nLabs and Goldens are wonderful working breads that LOVE to task. Which is why they make such wonderful service dogs. \n\nNala has shown proficiency and could be trained as a wonderful backup to technology in your life. She already trained herself in one area you were having issues. \n\nThat's part of the beauty of a relationship with a dog. Your dog obviously loves you and wants to help you. \n\nI'm sure you give Nala all the pets and cuddles she deserves.", "You're kidding.  Nala sounds like an absolute brilliant badass! She taught herself how to have a job. They LOVE having jobs!\n\nYou are NTA but this alleged friend certainly is. Imagine, virtue signaling outrage because a dog has a job. Bloodhounds and cattle dogs must really chap her ass.", "NTA. Your 'friend' sounds like an unkind person. She made fun of your dog's name and the fact that Nala learned how to assist without being asked or trained to do so. Good for you for kicking her out.", "NTA. Not that your dog is specifically a service dog, but has she never heard of service dogs?!? Nala has picked up alerting you to something you can\u2019t hear, which is something a service dog for someone that is Deaf would do. Such a smart girl! Who\u2019s a good girl? Nala!", "Absolutely NTA. Sounds like you and Nala have a wonderful relationship, and your friend is weirdly judgmental.", "NTA - Your friend is an idiot.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely normal behavior for a dog to alert it\u2019s person that someone is at the door, regardless of hearing status. You\u2019re lucky, my German Shepard alerts me by barking at the door as if the Huns were invading. She only stops when I tell her, \u201cwe\u2019re alright, I got this\u201d. Your Nala is very smart and chill!", "Weird judgement for a kickass and loving dog. Sounds like a great companion. Sounds like there was judgement and rude behavior prior to this though?", "NTA. Nala sounds like the goodest girl and you should pay the pet tax!", "Wait until your friend finds out about service dogs... Nala is just a smart girl who learned a very helpful habit! She's doing you a favor. Humans do similar things all the time. If my parents were on the phone and the door rang for a package, I'd bring it in for them. Nala is doing the dog equivalent, more or less. Neither of us are being servants!", "NAH. Your friend needs educating on service dogs and how they do work. Even though Nala isn\u2019t your service dog, she will still do things in place of one so it\u2019s normal for a dog to be treated as such. Kicking her out though was a bit too much.", "Maybe I'm missing something here, but as written it seems like you over-reacted. Apparently your friend made some effort to see you, made an (admittedly awkward) joke and you freaked out. \n\nI'l be generous and vote ESH, but throwing a friend out of your house seems like a disproportionate response.", ">She laughed and thought it was cute.\n\nEven with the \"servant\" comment, your reaction seems oddly defensive.  Maybe she just didn't find it that interesting to sit and look at multiple videos of your dog when she was actually there to visit *you.*\n\nESH, and both of you seem a little weird in how you interact with one another. Maybe just let this friendship go.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He was a short little guy so his folks couldn\u2019t always see where he was at, but he couldn\u2019t hear them when they called for him.

Happy dog helping out and your so called friend is angry? \n\nGive your good girl a scritch from me!\n\nNTA.\n\nETA. The name is amusing.  When I was a kid, everyone still named female collies Lassie.  In the 40s it was Rin Tin Tin. I named my long haired Shih Tzu Rapunzel long before the movie came out. I was surprised it wasn\u2019t a more common name for a long haired dog.  \n\nI have a service dog (would said \u201cfriend\u201d object to him working?), and he adores working.  He is getting on and I will need to start training a new dog in a couple years. I\u2019m seriously considering \u201cRex\u201d,  \u201cSpot\u201d, or \u201cFido\u201d as names.  They are really good names for training purposes.   But, no one actually uses them anymore!  And it will annoy TF out of my (adult) kids.  Always a good reason, right?", "NTA. You got rid of an over critical person- not a friend. She was never your friend- because who the heck criticizes a good girls name?!", "NTA. I hope she\u2019s your ex-friend now. What a miserable person. \n\nPS: Nala sounds like a wonderful dog \ud83e\udd79", "NTA A hearing dogs for deaf people is a total thing. Start googling hearing dogs for other tasks you could teach her to be your ears.", "NTA. My family's golden would help my mom pull weeds. She'd dig them up (or patiently wait if other plants would be in danger) and then shake the dirt off. We didn't teach her that. She just decided that was her job one day.", "You should tell her my two dogs bark every single time someone is at my door. Lol. Does she know that many breeds of dogs live to serve? Like shepherding dogs are wired to perform tasks. Some dogs love having jobs to do, want to stay busy with tasks because it's better than having nothing to do. Other breeds of dogs were bred to be more companion dogs and just want to sit on a lap and will act like they are being tortured if you ask anything of them. (Just ask my cockapoo). It sounds like your fiend is dog illiterate and doesn't know what she's talking about. The simple fact that your dog CHOSE to do these behaviors to help you out shows how much your dog loves you and desires to serve you, there's nothing wrong with that and there wouldn't be anything wrong with it if you had trained her to do these tasks either! Your friend is a moron and a judgmental one at that.", "NTA", "So is she saying that if a friend were to alert you that someone was at the door, that would make THEM a servant?  Or does she think so little of animals as to think they don\u2019t have a choice in what they are doing?  Because I\u2019ve got 50 years of experience that says otherwise, lol.\n\nMy littlest cat loves chasing around a little plastic spring toy (GREATEST TOY, EVER!).  But she wants me to be involved, so she will bat it around a little, then bring it over and drop it by my feet so I will throw it for her.  (Watching her sideways skid into the kitchen cabinets is a hoot, lol.). I\u2019m guessing she would think, with horror, that I trained my cat to fetch like a dog.  But anyone who thinks you can make a cat willingly do ANYTHING they don\u2019t want to do, come count the scars on my body.\n\nNTA.  Your dog is an angel.", "I am so confused why your friend would think servant? The first thing that comes to mind for me is your dog trained herself to be a service dog. I don\u2019t blame you for being offended and kicking her out. Nta", "NTA. Nala is a solid 16/10 (hero dog) yoir friend is a 3/10.", "She's not your friend and she doesn't sound like she likes dogs - or you - very much. She knows you're deaf, right? Dogs love to serve. And smart dogs like the one you have figure out ways to please their humans. What a weird thing to get prissy about. \n\nGood riddance. NTA.", "NTA. I guess my female Rottie mix is a servant to my deaf male Rottie, because she tells him when someone is at the door so he can go bark and protect me.  I used to try to tell him, he just ignored me.  Dogs are social and working animals, it is natural for them to find jobs to do for us.  Give your sweet girl an extra tummy rub for being smart enough to teach you to answer the door!", "NTA and welcome to the club of people who's dogs trained themselves to be service dogs (as in the ones for disability)", "NTA", "NTA - but from the way you wrote this, you were quick to react by kicking them out. Was your friend rude? Yes! Could you have told them it was a rude comment instead of throwing them out the door? Yes. If they continued to be rude, then kick them out, but it sounds like you kicked them out REALLY fast.", "NTA. Dogs love serving a good owner,  they're almost always happier with a job or a task, especially breeds like goldens. I'm sure Nala loves being able to feel important and helpful. She sounds like a smart pooch :)", "Dogs are so clever. Ours does similar my youngest is deaf but can hear low pitch sounds better than high pitches. If they are upstairs with no hearing aid on and I shout they can\u2019t hear me but can hear the dog barking. \n\nAs soon as I put dinner out for example the dog will run to the stairs and bark till they come down. \n\nBeing helpful iff their own back hardly makes them slaves. \n\nAs an aside I used to have two cats named Nala and Kiara. I loved the lion  king too", "This is why I love animals. My oldest cat learned on his own how to help when I have an anxiety attach or feel anxious. I didn't teach him, didn't even think to either. Was never my goal. He just did what he wanted. Animals are amazing that way.\n\nNTA. Cut contact with your \"friend\" and don't spare any time on people like that.", "Info: are you sure it wasn\u2019t just a dumb joke that went wrong? It\u2019s kind of a funny scenario to imagine you training your dog to answer the door like a butler and maybe that\u2019s what they were joking about?", "One of the best things you can do for your dog is give it a job. It\u2019s mentally stimulating for them, and it strengthens your bond. Not to mention, though Nala isn\u2019t a service dog I\u2019m guessing, she is acting as one in a way. The way I see it, is she is doing things that enrich your life, if for no other reason than letting you know someone at the door by booping you, and that\u2019s adorable.", "NTA: Golden retrievers are smart dogs and also highly trainable. Sounds like Nala is very in tune with OP and wants to help. It\u2019s in their nature and they often make good service dogs. Your friend is clearly an idiot about how some dogs work.", "NTA and your doggo is awesome!", "Seems as if your friend was feeling really annoyed and looking for a reason to dis you. Say this because she went to so much time and trouble to visit you and yet engaged in snark during her brief visit.  Not what one would expect from a friend.  \n\nYou recently moved into a new house.  Could that be it?", "Okay you're deaf, how did you have the conversation?", "That was my first thought too. She clearly doesn't understand dog psychology. From my interpretation sounds like the \"friend\" needs to learn that not every thought or opinion needs to be voiced. Think my choice of dog name is overrated or cheesy? Fine but keep it to yourself.", ">golden retrievers, who thrive on having \u201cjobs\u201d to do.\n\nJust repeating this for emphasis. A lot of misbehavior among retriever breeds is rooted in boredom over not having enough daily tasks/responsibilities.

Usually they bark, but Nala has learned that OP doesn't respond to the noise, so she figured out another way.  My neighbors are Deaf and their dog never barks for anything.  Like Nala, their dog worked out something different to communicate with them.", "I'm betting OP picked up on something in the visitor's facial expression or body language that said more than just the words she used.", "That's a very nice take on things - the friend was there to visit OP. \n\nAnd I may be overthinking this, but OP says the friend said they \"traveled\" to see her. If the friend lived nearby, they might say they \"stopped by\" or \"came over.\" I'm not saying the friend hopped on a plane, but the word \"traveled\" suggests this wasn't just a quick pop-in.

Mom made me come stay with her and my half brothers and sis...on the living room couch. Me and this dog were close, i am a huge dog fan/lover (strictly platonic). When I needed to use the bathroom it was upstairs and I had to waddle up the steps and back down. The dog was either going to the top of the stairs  (if he was upstairs already) and sit at the top and watch me come up or he'd sit at bottom and watch me go up if he was downstairs already. Once I reached either the top or bottom he'd go lay back down. This perplexed me for a while, think I called him stupid at one point till it dawned on me.

Lots of people name their Goldens Nala.\" Not a big deal. \n\nThe most important thing to me is that these two people are already friends. Sometimes friends say stupid things.
