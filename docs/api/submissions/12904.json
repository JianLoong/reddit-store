Both my parents are Korean too. \n\nMy boyfriend (m22) and I have been dating for 6 months. We go to college together, my family lives in the same city that our college is, his family however lives in another city so I haven't had the chance to met them until now. His parents invited us to spend the weekend over at their house so they can met me, up until now I have only spoke a few times on the phone with his parents but not with his siblings. \n\nHe has three siblings. An older brother (25), sister (13) and brother (9). \n\nThe problem with his sister is that apparently she's a kpop fan. My boyfriend had already told me this prior to meeting her and he told me to get \"ready\". I thought that meant that she would ask me to say something in Korean or something like that (it has happened to me before even by strangers in the street, it's annoying). Well, first things first she greeted me with an \"hello\" in korean, I faked a laugh and greeted her too. \n\nIt wouldn't have been such a deal if that was it, but then she continued calling me \"unnie\" and asking me if I called my boyfriend \"oppa\" and such things. She then started asking where did I lived when I was in Korea, if I had met any idols, if I ever tried to be an idol myself, etc. She insisted on sitting next to me and she was taking photos of me eating because \"I looked like an idol\". Like, what does that even mean? I'm just trying to eat, her mother had to tell her to stop because I was very visibly uncomfortable. After eating she wanted me to go dance some kpop choreographies with her because you know, every Korean knows how to dance I guess. We stayed there over the weekend so it was two days of not stop of this kind of behavior.\n\nI was so glad when it was time to leave. As soon as we pulled out the driveway I told my boyfriend \"you were not kidding, your sister is worse than I imagined\" he laughed and said it was \"expected\" of her to act like this. So I told him \"so she's always this racist huh?\" He took offense on that, he told me that his sister wasn't racist at all, she was only excited to met me. I said that all she did during our visit was to make assumptions about me and talk to me in a racist way (like c'mon, calling me unnie when she doesn't even know the context of the word has to be racist for Americans too right?). \n\nNow he's mad at me, I am mad at him too for not understanding my side too. So who's right?", "created_utc": 1679483731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yfqd7/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriends_little_sister/", "score": 1436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her intent was not to be racist, but her actions *were* racist, and poc shouldn't be persecuted for pointing out those patterns. She didn't blow up, she didn't yell at the kid (which a lot of us can't say we wouldn't have done), she mentioned it to her boyfriend in private in a space where he wouldn't have heard her.\n\nIf a 13yo white kid started calling me her n****, asked me if I ever met Tupac or Beyonce, and insisted that I must be able to rap because I'm black that would be racist. It's also weird as fuck to start calling a girl you just met your older sister.\n\nNTA", "Not every racist is a pitchfork carrying racist. \n\nThere is also subtle racism. \n\nIt's valid for people who endure racism, as little as it may be compared to other expressions of racism, to call it out. \n\nAlso, a 13 year can behave racist, even if it's just because they were uneducated. Racism is still racism. \n\nIt doesn't mean 13 yr old needs to be written off as a racist. It means she needs to be taught what's appropriate, and what's not. \n\nLiking Kpop is appropriate. Taking all these pics while OP eats, saying they look just like an idol etc, inappropriate. \n\nIt's not OP's job to educate, tho. I'd imagine if their partner truly cared about them, the partner would take this opportunity to educate their sister, opposed to invalidating their partner.", "I don't know how I'm reading so many Y T As. You took this BS for two days without complaining. You did your very best to not be confrontational in front of his family even though you had every right to. You only complained in the car to your boyfriend and somehow that's still not enough?\n\nPeople calling you TA are people who think it's worse to be labelled a racist than it is to suffer non stop racial objectification for two days.\n\nThe kid is not a monster or hitler youth material, but the way she treated you was racist. She let her obsession get over basic manners and some adult from her family should be letting her know her behaviour is not acceptable. I mean, she was taking pictures of you eating ?! What the hell. NTA a hundred times. You must have felt like your were the main attraction at the zoo.", "NTA lmao the comments are insane. Being a kpop fan and interested in the culture is one thing, being creepily obsessive and fetishizing koreans is a whole other thing. She may not have been malicious about it but she needs to learn that this is not acceptable behaviour and it's weird now that she's young. Not that it is OP's job to do this but damn.", "NTA.\nFrom the title I assumed something different, but no she makes you into a racial trope, Which is not OK.", "NTA \n\n13 is a good age for the little sister to learn about not fetishising people, which is what she was doing to you. She assumed that because you're Korean you must be into kpop, know all about the idols, and know how to do the dances she sees in kpop videos. \n\nYes, some of it was childish curiosity, but she crossed a line by taking photos of you, especially when you were eating, and treating you like a cardboard cutout, or her imagined, stereotypical and skewed version of what she thinks all Koreans must be like.\n\nI'm guessing that if you weren't Korean, or she wasn't into kpop, she would've just thought of you as her brother's girlfriend and treated you normally, instead of looking at you as some kind of shiny, exotic new toy that only existed for her edification. \n\nShe needs to be told that what she did and the way she treated you was racist, and that it made you deeply uncomfortable, because she wasn't seeing you as a human with your own agency. She wasn't even seeing you as her brother's SO. You were basically her My First Barbie: Korean Edition.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to tell his sister that her behaviour and attitude was disrespectful, that the way she treated you was racist, and that she doesn't get to use you to indulge her kpop fantasies. \n\nIf he's brushing this off, it might be time to think about the relationship moving forward, because if/when something like this happens again, it doesn't sound like he's going to be in your corner, especially when it comes to his family.", "NTA. The biggest thing that concerns me is that they aren\u2019t trying to correct her on certain things and to help her understand what behavior is okay and what isn\u2019t. She is the way she is because her family isn\u2019t trying to help her appreciate the culture and learn that she can ask questions and be interested without offending others. She\u2019s 13. He\u2019s acting like she\u2019s 7 or something.", "It sounds like you were racially objectified, and it's valid that you're not okay with it. \n\nNTA, because nobody gets to tell you what *you* find racist against yourself. If they aren't of Korean decent, they have no say in the matter.", "NTA. If people had to be fully aware that what they are doing is racist for it to count as racism, then no one would ever be called out and nothing would ever change.", "NTA\n\nYour title is a little misleading, but after reading what actually happened... holy shit!\n\nI understand that girl is 13 and stupid as teenagers often are in their excitement, but that went too far. The parents have missed out on some good parenting there and your boyfriend should have warned her and protected you better.\n\nAnd those mentally challenged who claim here it wasn't racist really need to take a long look into the mirror.", "As someone who likes kpop, NTA. It\u2019s okay that she enjoys a particular genre of music, but at 13 she should know that taking pictures of people eating is entirely inappropriate, and making you do kpop dances is just weird. She clearly has a single stereotyped view of your whole culture, and someone needs to (gently) have a chat with her about how what she sees idols do is just a tiny snapshot of what it might mean to be Korean, and trying to make all Koreans she meets fit into that box is racist stereotyping, even if it\u2019s unintentional (which I\u2019m sure it is). I know how it feels when people say I look like every other mixed race person or start trotting out stereotypes about Black people around me, and she\u2019s doing the same thing to you OP, even if she doesn\u2019t mean to.", "Nta. It is such a weird behavior, and the people saying yta are definitely not subject of racism. It\u2019s very ignorant behavior to call a korean person like that, and the assumptions she made were very racist", "Ummmm NTA. At all !!!!\n\nI\u2019m part Thai and while it\u2019s not to this level, people still fetishize my ethnicity, romantically and platonically and ask me wild ass questions just bc I told them I\u2019m part Asian. I\u2019ve noticed with the rise of BTS especially (aka the last few years) , it\u2019s so much worse for Koreans. People do it to MY DOCTOR !!!!! \n\nThe picture taking while OP was eating was \u2026. crazy and not very appropriate & OP was super polite to go along with things. His sister may not realize how offensive she\u2019s being and maybe being checked will help her not make social faux pas like this in the future.", "NTA I'm Black American and White people do the same things to me sometimes it's really annoying and they don't seem to understand some of their actions although they may not be intentional can be a bit prejudice and racist", "I think I'd maybe say NAH.\n\nYou were absolutely being racially objectified, but I wouldn't be surprised if your boyfriend and her sister are totally unaware of why that behaviour was racist and what the context around a lot of it is. It doesn't make it ok, but a conversation about it might be helpful. \n\nBut then again it shouldn't be your job to educate people on their racist behaviour so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "NTA.  Her behavior was racist, but many people don\u2019t have a proper understanding of what racism is to appreciate that.", "I wouldn't call the unnie thing racist. But definitely cringe and creepy. Like a dude from somewhere else coming up to me and calling me honey or yummy and I'd be like across the street so fast.\n\nEverything else is a weird toeline between racist and creepy fanatic. Like I'm surprised you survived that.\nNta", "Going against the grain. NTA. You were obviously very uncomfortable with being her token Korean. It is a prejudice way to treat people, and I'm sorry you were uncomfortable all weekend.", "She is a tween. K-pop is marketed here to tweens.  She is extremely immature but and interested in the culture.\nI think your being a bit harsh.  However, someone should have told her she is being rude.", "She's not racist because she likes K-pop, she's racist because she's ignorant which could have easily been avoided if her mom or OP's bf educated her. She's still a kid, she does have time to unlearn these behaviours. OP, I know it isn't your job to educate her,  but it doesn't seem like your bf or her mom will, just incase you weren't aware. Now I'm so white that I don't tan in the summer, I burn in 5 minutes. That being said I'm honestly now wondering if I've been ignorant and racist previously in my life, but I have such a bad memory that I don't remember. I will make sure to watch myself now though, so I'm glad you posted this. I'm not glad that it happened, because nobody deserves to be stared at and treated like an animal. That said, your bf was brushing it off and it's been 6 months. My alarm bells are ringing, it seems like he doesn't care how you feel. I don't know how to end comments, so I guess thanks for reading?", "Ok all I'm going to say is wtf would a person take a photo of you while eating. That's rude and gross. No one wants a bad photo of themselves, like does she take pictures of everyone while they eat?! That's gross as F.", "NAH. She's 13 and obsessed with KPop. Knowing a few KPop fans, that's basically all they talk/think about. They're obsessed with the culture, not just the music/band members. You've BEEN to Korea. You're literally living this little girl's dream. Should she tone it down? Absolutely. Is it racist? No. Inappropriate? Slightly. But again. she's 13 and ignorant. Tell her she's making you uncomfortable and educate her (although her family should be the ones stepping in here), as we should be doing with children.\n\nRead the definition of racism. Was she using prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism to make you feel inferior? Sounds like she was idolizing you. You have information and experiences and a language she is dying to immerse herself in. Did you tell her not to call you unnie, or did you let it slide? How is she supposed to understand how that makes you feel unless you or someone tells her? People can't read minds, and a child doesn't inherently know better. A lot of people seem to think that racism is just the act of even acknowledging race.\n\nTell her you don't like KPop. That will shut her down.", "NTA. Korean here. O lord..she\u2019s a koreaboo lol. And yes her actions were so offensive. Clearly her intent wasn\u2019t but the behavior was so ignorant and creepy. Literally fetishizing you and Korean culture. Yikes. I cringed reading this \ud83d\ude33", "NTA - Wow, that sounds like a very frustrating and exhausting experience. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. I can relate to some of what you said because I\u2019m a Native American/Mexican woman and I\u2019ve faced similar situations before where people seem to think that Native and/or Mexican people are like this monolithic group and we all do and enjoy same things. You're definitely NTA for calling her racist because, despite seeming to not have harmful intent, her actions were racist. She needs to learn the difference between appreciation and appropriation, between curiosity and obsession, between admiration and fetishization. And she's definitely not too young at 13 to learn these things. Same goes for your boyfriend. He needs to learn these things too and have a conversation with his sister about it after he apologizes to you for being an ass. \n\nYou have every right to set boundaries and express your feelings. You don\u2019t have to tolerate or endure her harassment or microaggressions, no matter her intent. You deserve respect and dignity as a human being, not as an object of someone else\u2019s fantasy. Hopefully your boyfriend will meet with his family and address this issue so next time (if there is a next time) you go there you will have a more pleasant and appropriate experience.", "May get downvoted, but you're NTA.\n\nThe problem isn't that she \"likes\" K-pop, it isn't a problem that she knows choreo to her favourite group. The problem is the bf's sister reducing OP to a stereotype and calling her nicknames without ever actually checking if OP was okay with it.\n\n>She insisted on sitting next to me and she was taking photos of me eating because \"I looked like an idol\". \n\nThe sister is treating OP like a museum attraction, and that's not okay. Taking photos of someone and making them uncomfortable is NEVER okay, it doesn't matter how old the person is or what their intentions are, and if they are children or incapable of understanding then it is on the parents and/or family of that person to educate them. Stop putting the emotional labour on the people who've been made to feel uncomfortable in the first place.\n\n>I'm just trying to eat, her mother had to tell her to stop because I was very visibly uncomfortable.\n\n13 is old enough to start understanding social cues, and the mum (fortunately) stepped in.\n\nSo, the ultimate question, _was she racist?_ Yes. No matter how well intentioned she was, yes. You don't go up to black people with textured hair and ask to touch it because you think it's pretty. You don't start wearing bindi as per South Asian cultures without understanding the context and whether it's actually appropriate for you. You don't reduce Koreans down to a kpop stereotype and ignore their entirely individual personality and identity. She may not have been malicious, but it doesn't mean her behaviours are absolved, and her family (OP's bf) should be educating, not jumping down OP's throat when she expresses her concerns.", "NTA -- these comments haven't really experienced racism in any way that counts. OP is clearly pointing out that the sister never talked to her, or made any attempt to, interact with her in any way that wasn't about her race. All interactions were made on the a fetishised caricature of what the teenager assumed to represent the entirety of OP's character.\n\nIt's like that scene in Get Out where the Dad talks to the MC about \"Obama\" and rap and what not. It might not be palatable to average American, but feelings of exclusion and \"otherness\" that come with reinforced stereotypes are very much part of the racism that much of the immigrant diaspora perceives.\n\nAlso, news flash guys, this is coming from a hardcore ex-weeb herself, but 13 is OLD enough to be the AH in this situation. I was a anime-weeb; but I was also old enough to understand that people are feeling uncomfortable in a situation, and also try to talk to people about things that aren't my singular interest. Asshole, again, might be a stretch, but OP is in no way the wrong.\n\nEdit: also, with the logic of her just being a kid, children are never ever in the wrong because they don't mean it and they're just excited. The fact is, the same actions in someone just two years older would be borderline insane. You can be an asshole BECAUSE you're ignorant, because ignorance can harm other people. The only difference in children is, its easier to correct, and harder to blame on a inherent character flaw -- but for any real correction to occur, you have to admit that the sister is wholeheartedly in the wrong.", "NTA. Yeah she\u2019s only 13 but that sounds pretty out of control. Her parents need to educate her better and you telling your boyfriend that will hopefully get back to them.", "NTA. I don't know why K-Pop stans can't self-actualize, but there are so many in the comments here giving YTA verdicts that just did not read the post. \n\nTaking pictures of you while eating is crazy. So is bf for not agreeing with you. Get out of this relationship while you can, sister.", "ESH \nShe\u2019s 13. She\u2019s still a child. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a racist but who I think is T A here is the parents and your boyfriend for not correcting the behavior. But also, you didn\u2019t express anything to him all weekend until you left and then called her a racist? You have to communicate before you explode like that \nTo be real though, I don\u2019t see this relationship working out unless you guys communicate about this and get on the same page.", "I'll throw in an NTA because some of the things she said/did were definitely very ignorant. But I don't think she is the asshole either. Honestly, 13 year old fangirls can be a lot, and at that age some kids still don't always pick up on social cues well. \n\nThe assholes here are the adults in her life who did not correct her and just let her act like this because \"it's to be expected\". Your boyfriend should've been the first one to step in when you were uncomfortable and gently explain to her she was being obnoxious, and how her behavior could be interpreted. Her parents should also not be enabling her. Sounds like her family thinks it's cute that she's in her kpop fangirl phase and that's why she gets a pass, but they need to get a grip and intervene before it becomes a larger problem.", "I'd say NTA\n\nShe made you uncomfortable for the simple fact that you're korean. She excepts you to fit the standards that mass culture created for koreans. That's not blatant racism, but it's definitely internalised racism.\n\nI know it shouldn't be up to you, but I think that educating her about this would be a great thing. If she really is interested in korean culture (which I think I can safely state is much more than idols and choreographies), she will most likely take a step back and reconsider her behaviours.\n\nBut yeah, that's internalised racism.", "NTA. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated like a novelty around anyone, least of all family. Liking K-pop is obviously totally fine but taking pictures of you eating and getting excited about your race because you \u201clook like an idol\u201d is out of line. All the  people saying you\u2019re TA would likely have a different opinion if you were black and treated this way. It isn\u2019t okay.", "NTA, she was absolutely fetishizing you and treating you like a toy, not a person. That is racist behavior, whether she intended harm or not. You, the only person qualified to call out her behavior, expressed that you felt uncomfortable due to her actions and instead of acknowledging that the sister might be engaging in racist behavior, decided to attack you for being offended. \n\nBut you called her racist, which will always get a huge knee-jerk reaction out of non-POC (as evidenced here in the comment section).", "NTA, I am not sure she is racist but sure has some weird thing for Koreans. You are right to be mad and annoyed. That sounds like it was a terrible weekend. Your BF and his parents should be really embarrassed.\n\nPeople get super defensive if you say racist. She was 100% stereotyping you and Koreans.", "NTA. She may not be racist with hatred, but she's on the line of fetishizing a culture. She assumes you can dance Kpop, assumes you even know the language, she's using terms she isn't 100% sure of. She can learn from this, so hopefully she does.\n\nAlso, you're going to get a lot of comments from Kpop fans on this, beware.", "NTA and the people summarizing it as \u201cso liking K-pop is racist\u201d sound like hit dogs hollering. Making assumptions about someone based on their race, is racist. But \u2018racist\u2019 is not the end all be all, you can change and acting like her calling the kid that is the worst part of this post is delusional. If you are a poc and your bf is more mad at you calling his little sister a racist instead of correcting her when you are obviously uncomfortable with how she is treating you, throw the whole bf away.", "Assuming a person shares your obsession because of their race is a biased behavior and therefore, yes, racist. Sister and clearly BF were taught it is okay to treat someone based on race alone. \n\nNTA. Sister was inappropriate and needs to be taught that her behavior was hurtful. However, I suspect she is neurodivergent and also being 13, lacking social grace to see how uncomfortable it made you feel. BF is the asshole for gaslighting your experience. He doesn\u2019t get to tell you what feels like racial bias.", "NTA \nI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s with all the yta. Yes she\u2019s 13 but her behavior was racist. This could be an opportunity for your boyfriend to talk to her about it but instead he took offense. He warned you before hand so he definitely knew her behavior wasn\u2019t going to be the best. Taking pictures of you while you eat is so awful and I can only imagine how uncomfortable that must\u2019ve been. Definitely NTA", "NTA, anyone calling you an AH in these comments doesn\u2019t understand the concept of micro aggressions. White people in general get incredibly defensive when hearing the word racist so I think it was a poor choice of words, but also it\u2019s not your job to cater to white fragility. The behavior was racist and fetishizing, you called it out as such.\n\nIn response to comments I\u2019ve seen about her age:\n\nKids can also be racist. Racism is a part of American culture and discussing it is how we get rid of it. If you stop seeing racism as a character trait and see it as an issue that can and should be resolved with education, you would not be so bothered by the word.\n\n13 is also old enough to be called out for your behavior. I was racist at 13, I got called out, I became a better person. Racist is not a definition of who you are unless you choose not to change. Or if you choose to be the victim.", "I'm going to go with ESH. Yes, how your boyfriend's sister acted was completely inappropriate and full of constant (unintended) microaggressions that were obviously not acceptable for you to have to put up with. However, she's 13. 13 year olds are not fully developed adults. 13 year olds with fixations on things tend to have even less of a grip on how to behave appropriately when they're talking about the thing they're obsessed with. Hopefully with the objectivity of some time you can see she's not racist and it wasn't really acceptable to label her as such. Annoying as it is, she's just a 13 year old girl acting how early teens do when they're fixated on something.\n\nI think your boyfriend's parents should have shut this behaviour down much earlier than they did. They dropped the ball badly there, as did your boyfriend. I also think your boyfriend needs to talk to his sister about appropriate behaviour. *Then* I think you would have grounds for it being racist if she did the same thing next time.", "I dont think she is racist. She's just overly obsessive with kpop.", "Hmm, I\u2019m going to go NAH in general, because as a white woman I can\u2019t tell you what you do or don\u2019t find racist and/or offensive.  \n\nI do think you need to go easier on her though, firstly because she\u2019s 13, and secondly there is nothing inherently racist about being white and loving K-pop, Korean culture, and wanting to learn Korean.  My daughter is your age and is currently studying in Korea because she\u2019s a linguist and is adding to her portfolio of languages before going to graduate school.  She loves a couple of K Pop bands too; would you refer to her as racist?\n\nYour bf\u2019s sister sounds a little obsessive and irritating, but no more so than many other 13 year olds.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll calm down and grow out of it.  It certainly doesn\u2019t sound as if it was her intent to stereotype you, it sounds more like she was REALLY excited to meet you.

She obviously knows only what she read on the internet and she's just a kid and doesn't know any better...", "Even if it is technically racist, it is the kind of learned racism that is from ignorance.  She thinks she is learning about Koreans through kpop and is too naive to understand that is not all of Korea. How did you expect your bf to act when you called a child out like that? You are not an asshole, but you lack tact. You had a whole weekend to talk to the girl. But instead you lashed out. You could have been proactive and asked to speak to her with her brother.but you did not. Instead you dumped on the brother when he was on his way back to school. Nk one is perfect snd it is not your responsibility to fix her. But what did you expect from the brother when you call his little sister racist. She is obviously naive snd sheltered. Wouldn't it have been easier to tell her Korea is a big country. And just like here in the US, Koreans have lots of interests. Tell her that you don't listen or watch kpop. That you think it is cool that she does and you would like to hear more about it. But that she should know that not all Koreans watch kpop just like not all Americans like country music or listen to rap.", "YTA. My best friend grew up in Hollywood. Cue my cousin asking if she went to Brad Pitt\u2019s house or what Anne Hathaway was like in person. Automatically assumed that living there meant she had been in movies, knew all the A list stars and had one of those mega mansions overlooking the whole city. Cousin meant no disrespect as I\u2019m sure boyfriend\u2019s sister didn\u2019t. Just confusing proximity (you are prob only one she has met who is from and lived in Korea) with experience.

I'm not, I love red meat so it's frustrating when she offers me the vegetarian dishes instead of the meat she offers everyone else, especially since it's been 2 decades. \n\n\nIt sucks to be judged on looks/race, and even more sucks when that results in different treatment.

I hesitate to call your bf an asshole, because I understand it\u2019s scary to have your worldview and your view of your family be challenged like that.

Many of the things she's doing would be racist in other context or from someone with more life experience, but I expect she'd do similar things if her obsession was with German techno and you had a German accent.

Of course, establish any boundaries you feel comfortable with (being recorded/photographed while eating sucks) but be gentle and age appropriate with her, please.

Both my parents are Korean too. \n\nMy boyfriend (m22) and I have been dating for 6 months. We go to college together, my family lives in the same city that our college is, his family however lives in another city so I haven't had the chance to met them until now. His parents invited us to spend the weekend over at their house so they can met me, up until now I have only spoke a few times on the phone with his parents but not with his siblings. \n\nHe has three siblings. An older brother (25), sister (13) and brother (9). \n\nThe problem with his sister is that apparently she's a kpop fan. My boyfriend had already told me this prior to meeting her and he told me to get \"ready\". I thought that meant that she would ask me to say something in Korean or something like that (it has happened to me before even by strangers in the street, it's annoying). Well, first things first she greeted me with an \"hello\" in korean, I faked a laugh and greeted her too. \n\nIt wouldn't have been such a deal if that was it, but then she continued calling me \"unnie\" and asking me if I called my boyfriend \"oppa\" and such things. She then started asking where did I lived when I was in Korea, if I had met any idols, if I ever tried to be an idol myself, etc. She insisted on sitting next to me and she was taking photos of me eating because \"I looked like an idol\". Like, what does that even mean? I'm just trying to eat, her mother had to tell her to stop because I was very visibly uncomfortable. After eating she wanted me to go dance some kpop choreographies with her because you know, every Korean knows how to dance I guess. We stayed there over the weekend so it was two days of not stop of this kind of behavior.\n\nI was so glad when it was time to leave. As soon as we pulled out the driveway I told my boyfriend \"you were not kidding, your sister is worse than I imagined\" he laughed and said it was \"expected\" of her to act like this. So I told him \"so she's always this racist huh?\" He took offense on that, he told me that his sister wasn't racist at all, she was only excited to met me. I said that all she did during our visit was to make assumptions about me and talk to me in a racist way (like c'mon, calling me unnie when she doesn't even know the context of the word has to be racist for Americans too right?). \n\nNow he's mad at me, I am mad at him too for not understanding my side too. So who's right?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Replace 'kpop' with 'rap' and 'Korean' with 'black' (and wind the clock back, say, 25 years if you want for the analogy to be closer for the association of music culture and racial group), and see how that falls.\n\nShe is indeed a child, and as such is in need of learning - something she won't do if her stereotyping and objectifying behaviour are not held up to be what they are - racist.\n\nNTA", "[removed]", "How is that in any way racist? I really don't understand that. It's annoying, it can be crossing your boundaries and you are definitely allowed to tell her you don't appreciate that behaviour, but it's not racist. For that, YTA.", "[deleted]", "YTA. She's 13! You could have spent the weekend quietly educating her but instead, you just call her racist for being interested in your culture? She comes across as a typical 13 year old who has found something they're super excited about but can't actually experience. You were the closest she's gotten to that actual experience.", "YTA just spend time with this girl and teach her.  As a kid I loved anime it's not racist to appreciate other cultures especially ones so different then the west", "Esh - you needed to speak up and tell her that you don\u2019t like k pop, but it\u2019s also weird how obsessed she is. Next time ask them to stop. A racist will not stop.", "YTA jeez, she is a child obsessing, ya know, like 13years olds do. The way you talk about your interaction makes you sound like quite a nasty person.", "YTA", "YTA", "She greeted you in your language and your reaction was to scoff at that.\n\nYou suck, dear.", "YTA she's 13 and heard you're from Korea. She even complimented you saying you looked like an idol yourself. She wanted nothing more but to be in your good graces and you called her racist in her ideology of you.", "honestly this sounds really fake. like im pretty sure i've read stuff like this before.", "What\u2019s the equivalent of an otaku for Korean culture cause the sister is def that. NTA. A lot of people who are racist don\u2019t think they are cause they aren\u2019t a klansman or calling for genocide. There are layers and degrees to this so even if her intents are \u2018positive\u2019 it is what it is.", "Nta. It is not your job to teach this child. Replace korean with black and kpop with rap, people would be calling it what it is racism and fetishization. Her parents/family need to step in  you shouldn't be subjected to this kind of behaviour, nor should anyone else.", "I'd say NTA.\n\nHowever some things to consider: her sister is only 13 and you might be the first Korean from Korea she actually meets. Which means, what she learned from your culture is mostly racist cliches from different media, and there was nobody to teach her better.\n\nIt's not your job to educate her, but if you want to fix that behavior of her, you might have to teach her about Korean culture and how life in Korea is not what she sees on social media, youtube and netflix.", "Nta \neven if she is 13, she still treating you based on steriotypes and not as a person (taking a picture while you ate) being called a racist sucks, but thats not something permanent.\nyeah would be racist if someone starting calling me garota de ipanema ou mama just because i am latina, or wanting me to dance samba, taking pictures of me because its like a novela, the people saying y.t.a are mad that you described what she was doing correctly, even if she doenst mean it, it is still racist or fetchizing", "NAH I think you\u2019re absolutely entitled and right to feel uncomfortable with what happened, her behaviour needs reigned in and her family need to explain the issues of racial stereotyping. She's 13 and ignorant though, and was excited to meet someone she assumed (wrongly) would share a similar interest with her. If all she has encountered online, in her kpop bubble, are koreans who love the things she loves, she has misguidedly made a stereotype of all koreans. \n\nPhotographing you without permission obviously overstepped a line that even a 13 year should know better than, her saying you looklike an idol, I think just means you're really pretty like all the gg idols are, misguided but not malicious. \n\nShe definitely needs to learn to not cross boundiaries and learn about the dangers and hurt of stereotyping and prejudice. Hopefully her brother will help her understand why it wasn\u2019t okay...but it sounds like he may needs to educate himself too, if he didn't see any issue at all.", "ESH \n\nWhile I don\u2019t believe the little sister is racist, the things she was doing were. She was completely overzealous and overbearing. It is clear she has never been taught boundaries, respect of someone else\u2019s privacy, or respect of other cultures\u2026and that fault lies entirely with her parents, and to a lesser extent her older brother (your bf). It is fine for her to like K-pop. It is not okay for her to assume that all Koreans are the same. It is not okay that she showed a complete disrespect for you. But mostly it was not okay that her parents and your boyfriend didn\u2019t do anything to stop it. \n\nIt was a little harsh to call her racist instead of her actions. However, it is clear she is obsessed with Koreans, and at this point it is an unhealthy obsession. Her parents need to step up and teach her respect for other people and their cultures. And your boyfriend should have stood up for you and put a stop to her behavior instead of accepting it as being harmless\u2026because it\u2019s not.", "ESH\n\nShe's too young to realize what she's doing, even if yes, there's a racial component. \n\nYou're old enough to realize that.\n\nRealistically if she was obsessed with eg a boy band and you were from their high school and home town, her behaviour would be similar. \n\nYou aren't wrong for being uncomfortable but calling her a racist is a bit much. It would be really easy to correct her enthusiasm and it doesn't need to be by you but a little perspective would go a long way.", "ESH. I understand the kid is 13 but when my 8 year old made a statement about 2 kids in his class that were black, they were bullying one of his friends, I explained to him that yes what he said was correct in his observations but he cannot make generalized statements like he did regarding people based on how they look. I told him that he will come off as racist. Parents should be having these discussions about stereotypes and making assumptions about people based on race and/gender. Instead of just saying the 13 year old is racist someone needs to actually TELL the kid how her actions can apear to people thats how kids learn.", "NTA - But you overreacted a little bit. She was rude, and it made it you uncomfortable, but racist is the wrong word. She isn't being racist. She wasn't discriminating against you for being Asian. She wasn't calling you derisive, bigoted names, making insulting comments in a fake Korean accent. \n\nShe was STEREOTYPING you and Korean culture. She clearly is a little girl, and mom and dad need to spend some time teaching her social cues and how to be respectful of other people and other people's cultures. \n\nYou didn't ask for my advice, but you did ask for our opinions. My opinion is that you should take this opportunity to teach your BFs sister something meaningful about Korean culture and history, instead of just what she has found through mainstream Kpop.", "ESH. She may not have meant to be racist. She just sounds obsessed with K-pop and things associated with it and the culture. Being from i assume a white American family she probably doesn't know that certain words used are racist. Although it shouldn't be your responsibility to educate this girl, it would appear that no one else around her understands the problems with her behaviour and it would've beneficial for you and her for you to tell her that \"actually that word is not nice\", or \"you know not everyone from Korea is or wants to be an idol right?\" For you to jump to assuming she's racist seems a bit harsh when she just sounds excited to meet someone who she thinks is similar to her idols. It's wrong of her to assume that but also quite normal for kids to act that way without understanding how it appears. She does however seem a bit old to act that way and is definitely old enough to have her errors pointed out. She sounds more like a 6 year old than a 13 year old and her parents should at the very least have told her to tone it down", "Ytah simply for the way you put it. It seems you could have gone to your boyfriend during the visit and told him your feelings. While the sister was objectifying you and indeed, in a racist way- I don\u2019t think she meant to. She needs to be educated on her behavior for sure. But she\u2019s still his sister and I\u2019m sure he cares for both of you. It feels like you \u201cattacked\u201d (as me and my spouse put it) her, and through that attacked him, which isn\u2019t a good basis for a relationship. Don\u2019t let those things fester and speak out of frustration later.", "NTA, her actions were racist and objectifying, though her intent was probably not. She's 13 so she probably doesn't realize how offensive she was being. \n\nI'd be way more angry at your boyfriend for reacting the way he did. The sister is young and needs to learn appropriate behavior. He should know better. \n\nHer older brother needs to explain to her how uncomfortable she made you feel. Instead of arguing with you and denying that her actions were racist, he should be explaining to her that her actions were inappropriate, she made you feel uncomfortable and objectifed, and she owes you an apology. If he doesn't I hope the parents do, otherwise it's a missed opportunity for the sister to learn and grow.", "YTA\n\nWhy not explain some of this to his sister? She was excited, and sure she went a little overboard. Why not just talk to her. She is young still, and it could have been a great opportunity to teach her about your culture. Instead you had to jump on the conclusion that she is racist.", "YTA, she is 13 and doesn't understand how this would be annoying. I think you are way over the line saying this is racism and not just a kid meeting someone from a country/culture they love and are a bit obsessed with. again yes it sounds annoying, it sounds like you had a lot to put up with, but it wasn't racism.", "NTA. She's not a racist, yet, but well under way if no one curbs her behaviour. Give her the same treatment. Ask her to make up some line dances, call her Sissy with a Southern drawl, take pictures while she eats and say you are sending it to your Korean family so they can watch a Whitey eat. She probably won't like the way you treat her, which is how she treated you.", "YTA. JFC when did liking Pop music or having dread locks become racist?", "NTA. How did no-one step in sooner to quietly explain to the kid that she was making presumptions about someone based on their race, or outright call her out for taking stalker photos of someone without their consent?\n\nIt's still racism even if people don't realise they're being racist.", "YTA. How many others in (I'm guessing) the US have made an effort to greet you in Kirean?\n\nNot racist.", "ESH", "YTA and how do you even need to ask this?", "YTA 1000%. you lost a real opportunity to not only express some your unique culture to an enthusiastic teen, but also lost an opportunity to share some knowledge about setting boundaries and disempowering stereotypes (even though it's not your job, you're older and could have done some good).", "YTA instead of being negative how about you turn it into a positive and educate her. She\u2019s 13 year old with a crush on K-pop who is getting a distorted impression of Korean culture. No different than other people in different countries thinking everyone in America lives in California or New York and are living those life styles.", "Ones taste in music does not make someone more or less racist. You are the asshole. She seems excited to learn more about you and your culture. You are the racist one here for assuming she is racist for being interested in your culture.", "I agree with you. While the 13 year old may not have intended to be racist, she inherently was because she was being ignorant. Ignorance can lead to racism and this is a good example. The best thing for the family to do would be to explain to the daughter that not everyone in a specific culture or ethnicity acts the same way. I think a lot of people are going after OP because of how she reacted but honestly, I understand. I may be white, but I\u2019ve had my fair share of second hand embarrassment from family members acting a certain way towards POC.", "Brilliantly put!  Kudos to you, my friend.", "So well put about how white people associate racism with intent and not impact! Literally anytime someone white defends racism it\u2019s always like - but that\u2019s not what they meant! Or they try to ask for more information/ context.\n\nNo, if I am telling you, as an Indian, that I found what you did or said racist, fucking accept it. The gaslighting is especially bad here in the UK because British people largely vehemently deny that there is systemic racism in every aspect of life here and simply brush it off as a minor inconvenience when it\u2019s literally eh lived experience of so many people.", ">people associate racism with intent and not impact.\n\nFinally someone said it.", "Your post literally changed my judgement.\nI was of the opinion that while weird and more than a tad nauseating, I didn't think it was racist per se.\n\nBut you made a great point in separating her actions from her intent. And her actions were indeed racist.", "This comment needs to go to the top.", "The only thing is, I think a more accurate comparison is if someone asked you if you knew American celebrities and dances. Since OP has actually lived in Korea, it seems like the sister is asking all of these questions because the kpop industry  is, of course, based in Korea. Now, if OP had never lived in Korea, then yeah, I think the racist meter jumps up much higher. Maybe I am being too optimistic, though.", "But unnie means older sister. The n word and unnie by no means have any similarities. Ones a Korean word and the other is a racial slur. I\u2019m still completely in the dark how any of this could be perceived as racist? Nothing about her actions were racist, you could argue a bit xenophobia but even then she wasn\u2019t being prejudiced or showing a hatred towards Korea, quite the opposite.\n\nIn my opinion this has absolutely zero to do with race. Your comment is so far fetched it\u2019s incredible. \n\nI\u2019m Scottish. This is more similar to an American kid saying to me if I\u2019ve ever met lewis Capaldi or Gerry Cinnamon. Speaking to me in Scots or asking if I can play the bagpipes or if I wanted to do a highland dance choreography. Do you see how that makes a wee bit more sense? Rather than it being compared to getting called the n word lmao.", "Thank you for this u/slutforlibraries . I honestly did not get it till I read your comment. I just thought that the OP was being harsh on an over excited teenager. Thank you once again x", "You're entirely correct, and thank you for calling me out on my bs as well. Cuz my(white) brain thought \"definitely problematic, but not racist\" However I was looking at intent, not impact.\n\nThe kids impact and actions we're 100% racist and the parents need to do soemthing about it before it becomes worse.\n\nNTA", "Why do you think this is similar to calling you a slur?", ">a lot of white people associate racism with intent and not impact\n\nIME, it's not just white people, but the distinction is more readily understood by folks who have been on the receiving side of impacts!", "She could have easily made it a learning moment and say something along the lines of not all Koreans do/enjoy these things.

Also your username is -life-", "I think this is the correct way of looking at things.  Were the sister's actions racist? Yes.  Were they done maliciously? Doubtful.  She's an excited, dumb 13-year-old who needs to be taught better.", "This is a truly balanced view, thank you", "Allie ship means advocacy.

BF should recognize and step in and say something.", "Well said!!!!", "This response really should have more upvotes. Even OP herself said that the 13 year old \"doesn't even understand the contexf\" when calling her unnie. so on some level, she acknowledges that the girl doesn't know any better, but than wants to hold her to the standards of another adult? And ignore the context that this a 13 year old child? Ironic. She's 13, help her understand why that's not ok. She'd probably be willing to learn from someone she likes, and this may be the first opportunity to understand.", "Take my poor human award gold\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udf96\ufe0f\nSpot on!!", "I agree with your sentiments here, although I do think it would have been more appropriate to have a discussion with the boyfriend about how she felt rather than making an off hand comment calling his sister a racist. He's probably defensive of his little sister so a different approach may have led to an open and honest conversation about what she was uncomfortable with so that he could then talk to his sister about what was inappropriate and why.", "I agree with your sentiment. I believe the word we are all looking for is IGNORANT not racist.", "Yeah i felt like an animal in a zoo, like the taking photos of me when I was eating was so weird, I'm trying to eat leave me alone.", "People lose their mind around the \"racist\" word. The BF clearly recognized there would be a problem here due to OPs race but I'm not suprised he freaked out at the (correct) use of the word. The girl reduced poor OP to a stereotype, but because she wasn't being hateful about it, then CLEARLY she isn't the dreaded R word. \ud83d\ude44\n\nNTA OP, stand your ground here but I bet the BF takes a little while to fully understand what is going on here. It's clear his family isn't addressing these issues at home.", "Fr lol I'm african and if someone just came in talking about the lion king and asking me about what village I'm from I'd be offended af. Yeah she's a kid but its not like OP screamed at her", "This! I can't believe how many people are telling her she's TA, after she spent the whole weekend with this kid annoying and offending her every waking minute, and she didn't even call the girl racist to her face. \n\nOP, I'd say NAH, she's at peek cringe age and will be unbearable when it comes to her current interest/obsession, it's very unfortunate she focused all that hyper-annoying energy on you all weekend. Please don't be afraid to gently but firmly enforce your boundaries, just \"hey, I don't feel comfortable with the pictures while I'm eating, could you please stop?\" or something.\n\nYes, she was going off of some racist stereotypes, but it did not come from a bad place, she meant no harm and was just overly excited. However, she is old enough to learn not to objectify people and to be more mindful of how her actions are impacting others, so I'm glad you did say something to your boyfriend about it... It's a bit ridiculous that he seems to think you should just put up with it.", "this one. 100%.", "This should be higher.", "Yeah the title of this thread had me thinking OP called this girl a racist for liking KPop, but she called her racist for, you know, doing racist things.", "THANK. YOU. It\u2019s driving me crazy seeing all these people saying that it\u2019s not racist because she didn\u2019t mean any harm.", "This. This situation sucks and it sucks even more that parents didn\u2019t do anything to stop the little sis from harassing OP. But at ages 21 and 13 neither are fully neurodevelopmentally mature and are behaving as such. I also agree that, especially in light of a lot of these responses, these people don\u2019t know or understand what racial objectification is. \n\nIt would have been nice if OP held some grace for the little sis, sure. But she was in an unfamiliar environment, where she probably felt like she had to be on her best behavior, being bombarded by a little girl objectifying the shit out of her. For two days. And no one stepped in to actually get the kid to cut it out. I would have been full of nerves. \n\nNAH. But OP, you need to talk to your boyfriend about what that behavior means to you. A lot non Asians do not understand what it\u2019s like to constantly be exoticized,treated like a cultural artifact, othered, and not as an actual person.", "This, this is right in because i think all the people saying op is racist haven\u2019t dealt with it understand this right here.", "Nta\nIt's really disappointing how far I had to scroll to find this.

They simply stated how little sister was acting. She was being racist. Also like, maybe they don\u2019t understand bc they\u2019re white but it doesn\u2019t take a mind reader to see that what little sister was doing was wrong. OP was being a good guest by not saying anything while staying with the family. Boyfriend and family should\u2019ve stepped up and told little sister to stop. It shouldn\u2019t have taken OP pointing out how wrong it was. You can see the family doesn\u2019t take it seriously when boyfriend underplays how bad his sister was after they left. He laughs it off. Being treated like an object isn\u2019t funny.", "I\u2019m sorry but\u2026.she didn\u2019t explode. This whole tone policing thing is also racist! She was increddddibly kind to this 13 year old while they were in the same space and then mentioned it after they left. MAYBE she could have mentioned it while they were at the house, but I\u2019m guessing they didn\u2019t have a ton of privacy and she was meeting the family for the first time! This is the mildest reaction.", "When did she \u201cexplode\u201d? That entire family knew the behavior was odd at best. OP was fetishized the entire weekend and she appropriately names what happened as racist in private when leaving. The opposite of exploding. Y\u2019all are wild.", "How the fuck is mentioning it to her boyfriend in the car on the way home her exploding? That's insane.\n\nOP took so much crap from the sister and tried to ignore it and communicated to her boyfriend at the end about how racist the behaviour was and his response was to shut her down. Why did he even need to be told? He was there, it was his sister, he witnessed it all. \n\nIt's not on OP to talk to a minor that she doesn't know, it was on the girl's family to step in and they didn't. OP tried to communicate with her boyfriend away from the family as to not cause a scene (even though she had every right to) and he was having none of it and you're saying she exploded and can't communicate?? Absolute bullshit.\n\n**OP you are NTA** at all but please consider why your boyfriend didn't step in at any point and completely disregarded your feelings. He doesn't see anything wrong in his sister's behaviour and that is beyond troubling.", "This. Her mother saw she was making you uncomfortable, there should have been a further talk with her about backing off. You also could have gently and politely told her that you have no interest in kpop, have no idea what she means by \"idol\". This would have given an even bigger opening for parents and boyfriend to be more firm with her. And if none of them were, then you could start reassessing your relationship.", "That is not what internalized racism is. Internalized racism is when the racially oppressed group adopt a white supremacist, self-hatred mindset.", "There's nothing racist about liking Korea/kpop/dramas/learning the language.

Which is the word for this?", "Do you seriously think it\u2019s reasonable to expect someone who is meeting their SO\u2019s family for the first time to start immediately trying to be a parent to their younger siblings? Almost anyone in that situation would just go with the flow to not ruffle any feathers and then talk privately with the person who is supposed to be their partner after the fact.", "Woah woah woah, being an asshole to someone of any descent does not make you a racist. Being an asshole to them BECAUSE of their descent does, that's a really important distinction to make.", "What? So it's obvious she was uncomfortable as a guest in someone else's home for the first time but it's OPs responsibility to educate the girl?", "It's weird you read this while post and whittled it down to the claim being the sister is racist bc she likes kpop?", "uh koreaboos are literally inherently racist tho", "She\u2019s making assumptions about somebody based on the race that is inherently racist", "Her actions were racist, regardless of her intent and regardless of her obsession. The idea that you have to actively dislike or look down on people of another race to act racist is incorrect.

YOU DO, RIGHT?!?!? OH WAIT NO YOU DON\u2019T, NOBODY DOES AS MUCH AS I DO!!!!!\u201d\n\nRacism is: Oh, you\u2019re Korean? All my assumptions and stereotypes about you are true!\n\nOP: NTA. I wonder about your BF not seeing this about his sister, though.", "I think koreaboo for K-pop/kdrama obsessed people?", "I think the term is Koreaboo, or that might be for someone obsessed with Korean culture in a reductive way. For ex, moving to SK to find a boyfriend because Kpop idols and Kdrama male leads are so polite and best boyfriend material so all Korean men must be", "Yeah, an obsession with a race. Which is racist. When I was 13 we were obsessed with having a gay best friend and we all wanted gay friends and my friends viewed gay men as commodities. Something out of fanfiction. That was homophobic. Being obsessed with the concept of  trait in this way is problematic. And I get it, she\u2019s 13. She doesn\u2019t know yet how to draw the line between the bands she loves and the culture they come from. Is this developmentally normal? Probably.

I mean, that is sort of a cute question from a small child, but if it were my child, I would be pleased to have you engage enough to explain that. I would certainly not say you were overstepping.  How long did they want their kids to believe that people ride giraffes?", "This! This comment is the comment! A 13 year old called me the n word once. They can most definitely be racist.", "Yeah of course, but it's not like calling someone honey or darling, for example.", "I agree with that. \n\nYou can be put off by it, definitely. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s similar to using a slur, in any way.", "Am I, tho?", "She doesn\u2019t genuinely appreciate Korean culture to treat someone this way, she treated OP like an animal at a zoo.", ">Most people just won't take that look inward and unfortunately \"most people\" are what we're dealing with in the world.\n\nYou are so right about this.", "I disagree, there is a reason that the road to recovery includes admitting that you\u2019re an alcoholic as one of if not the very first steps.\n\nI truly think coddling in this situation and pretending that it isn\u2019t something that it is only does more harm than good, and if this 13 yr old isn\u2019t told in matter of fact terms that what she\u2019s doing is wrong because it\u2019s racist, she risks a lot more than hurt feelings in the future", "Your statement makes me think of what a Russian dissident wrote in a novel:\n\n\"Don't expect sympathy when you're cold from someone who's not\".", "Sounds like you\u2019ve neglected to educate yourself on racism towards Koreans", "Similar story here, I'm mixed and I lived in Japan for 2 years. I had a lot of borderline inappropriate interactions with the kids that I taught there because they didn't know any better, you know, cause they're kids! I explained to them that while I appreciate that they love my curly hair it was inappropriate for them to touch it and guess what happened? They apologized profusely and stopped.", "She\u2019s not a celebrity", "That was not the only thing the 13 yo did and the fact that you can reduce it to just an interest about music while ignoring the unnie oppa and pictures just because she happens to be the same race is telling.", "It doesn't take ill intent to be racist.  Just ignorance and a willingness to stereotype.  Almost all racism has no ill intent.\n\nIt's still harmful.\n\nAlmost all traffic accidents have no ill intent, but they still kill people.", "Then how could what you said possibly make sense? Why would her being 13 prevent her from what is clearly fetishizing a commodified version of Korean culture?", "yes she is. The sister wasn't thinking of OP as her own person but as a characature of Korean people. You can be interested in a certain culture without acting as inappropriately as the sister did. Sure she is young, but impact is more important than intent", "Just need to point out that \"fetish\" doesn't have to be sexual. Merely an obsessive interest in. Not sure if that matters.\n\nThat said, we can't tell if she's fetishizing or just a really excited and cringey teen... the line is insanely blurry because of how teen minds work (ie, badly).", "She was absolutely displaying that behaviour.\n\nShe didn't just like Korean culture; she treated OP as if she was a walking Korean culture exhibit instead of a person.  She assumed literally every possible stereotype of Korean culture was not just automatically true of OP, but literally the only interaction she had with OP.\n\nYou are just flat out wrong.  This is not just racism, it's the most common and typical form of racism, and it's humiliating to deal with.\n\nNow, that's not a major fault in the kid.  Most humans are naturally pretty racist and if the kid hasn't been taught how not to do that then a mistake from a 13 year old is understandable.  The assholes here are the boyfriend and parents who stood by and watched without correcting her rude behaviour.", "I would say she is displaying that behaviour, a non-sexual fetish is just an excessive or irrational devotion to something. \n\nAnd given that she was so obsessed with Korea that she didn\u2019t respect the boundaries of a total stranger, I\u2019d say that\u2019s excessive.", "Most of \"these people\" are immigrants themselves and people with real experience of multicultural communities and cultures, or even children. OP is out of touch.", "And most westerners going to China report that they feel uncomfortable as hell due to this behavior. So why isn't OP allowed to feel similarly uncomfortable?\n\nOP is a person, not \"shit\" the sister \"finds interesting\".", "I was in elementary school tbf but the mom was pretty upset at me for telling her kid that it was like if I had told him Santa wasn\u2019t real. It was Georgia though", "I'm sure a lot of commenters here would tell you it was \"harsh\" to call that kid racist apparently.", "I like that.", "My comment had nothing to do with her specific ethnicity, it had to do with her response and handling. If a naive child makes you feel the same feelings as a hate monger YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE. This sub used to be about guidance, not validation. The whole point is she can be right to feel feelings and an asshole when she acts on them.", "[deleted]", "You mean the kid assumed a Korean person spoke Korean?\n\nReally, people like you are looking for racism, it's sad.", "I disagree with you here. Majority of racism has ill intent attached to it. This case however, did not. She is just a kid who was excited. And again, I am saying that OP is justified in feeling overwhelmed or irritated or whatever she felt, is totally reasonable. \n\n\nShe asked if she was TA for calling the sister racist which I think she is not. So for that, OP for me is an AH. We might have to agree to disagree on this one. As a fellow Asian, I would have just taken this in the spirit of a teenager obsessed with my culture and being happy to have met someone from the country. I wouldn\u2019t classify this as racist but thats just me.", "Like/Interest != Fetish", "She's 13, they rarely know boundaries with anything.", "It does, you don\u2019t understand the depth of racism and the type of racism towards someone who is Korean. So to you, these are naive acts by a child. We can replicate this situation with another race and another 13YO and people would blatantly understand", "That sucks. Racism is an important topic to discuss. You should bang on about it more.", "So, to be clear, you are of the opinion that because young teens don't KNOW boundaries, that their actions automatically aren't problematic?  \n\n\nListen man, I don't understand you or any of the posts you've made here. When young teens do shitty things, it doesn't mean they are shitty people... what it means is the adults in their life have an opportunity to course correct them.   \n\n\nIf a teen does something racist its *good* to call them out; its a lesson for them to learn.  \n\n\nYou on the other hand think its valuable for kids to stomp on boundaries without repercussions because you're acting like its some sort of offence to correct teens.", "So do that. Make the argument instead of saying it\u2019s a given. Otherwise it just sounds hollow. Kid wants to be this older girl.", "No we would not you may but most of us would know that this is a child trying to emulate and learn about another culture she is interested in not a racist hate filled person. There is nothing malicious here except the commenters trying to assign some sort of nefarious ulterior motives based on their personal experiences.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nI love this reply.", "[deleted]", "Calling this racism is an insult to people who deal with actual racism.\n\nI didn't say the kid didn't cross a line by showing too much interest. I'm just saying it wasn't coming from racism. It was coming from a 13 year old being a 13 year old.", "I\u2019ve dealt w quite a few racists in my time \ud83d\ude02 some of them were very kind people some of them were more like this", "People can usually discuss more than one thing at a time. Discussing all forms of racism does not dismiss the worst forms of it."]}
