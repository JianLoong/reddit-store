Both my parents are Korean too. \n\nMy boyfriend (m22) and I have been dating for 6 months. We go to college together, my family lives in the same city that our college is, his family however lives in another city so I haven't had the chance to met them until now. His parents invited us to spend the weekend over at their house so they can met me, up until now I have only spoke a few times on the phone with his parents but not with his siblings. \n\nHe has three siblings. An older brother (25), sister (13) and brother (9). \n\nThe problem with his sister is that apparently she's a kpop fan. My boyfriend had already told me this prior to meeting her and he told me to get \"ready\". I thought that meant that she would ask me to say something in Korean or something like that (it has happened to me before even by strangers in the street, it's annoying). Well, first things first she greeted me with an \"hello\" in korean, I faked a laugh and greeted her too. \n\nIt wouldn't have been such a deal if that was it, but then she continued calling me \"unnie\" and asking me if I called my boyfriend \"oppa\" and such things. She then started asking where did I lived when I was in Korea, if I had met any idols, if I ever tried to be an idol myself, etc. She insisted on sitting next to me and she was taking photos of me eating because \"I looked like an idol\". Like, what does that even mean? I'm just trying to eat, her mother had to tell her to stop because I was very visibly uncomfortable. After eating she wanted me to go dance some kpop choreographies with her because you know, every Korean knows how to dance I guess. We stayed there over the weekend so it was two days of not stop of this kind of behavior.\n\nI was so glad when it was time to leave. As soon as we pulled out the driveway I told my boyfriend \"you were not kidding, your sister is worse than I imagined\" he laughed and said it was \"expected\" of her to act like this. So I told him \"so she's always this racist huh?\" He took offense on that, he told me that his sister wasn't racist at all, she was only excited to met me. I said that all she did during our visit was to make assumptions about me and talk to me in a racist way (like c'mon, calling me unnie when she doesn't even know the context of the word has to be racist for Americans too right?). \n\nNow he's mad at me, I am mad at him too for not understanding my side too. So who's right?", "created_utc": 1679483731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11yfqd7/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriends_little_sister/", "score": 12302, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her intent was not to be racist, but her actions *were* racist, and poc shouldn't be persecuted for pointing out those patterns. She didn't blow up, she didn't yell at the kid (which a lot of us can't say we wouldn't have done), she mentioned it to her boyfriend in private in a space where he wouldn't have heard her.\n\nIf a 13yo white kid started calling me her n****, asked me if I ever met Tupac or Beyonce, and insisted that I must be able to rap because I'm black that would be racist. It's also weird as fuck to start calling a girl you just met your older sister.\n\nNTA", "Not every racist is a pitchfork carrying racist. \n\nThere is also subtle racism. \n\nIt's valid for people who endure racism, as little as it may be compared to other expressions of racism, to call it out. \n\nAlso, a 13 year can behave racist, even if it's just because they were uneducated. Racism is still racism. \n\nIt doesn't mean 13 yr old needs to be written off as a racist. It means she needs to be taught what's appropriate, and what's not. \n\nLiking Kpop is appropriate. Taking all these pics while OP eats, saying they look just like an idol etc, inappropriate. \n\nIt's not OP's job to educate, tho. I'd imagine if their partner truly cared about them, the partner would take this opportunity to educate their sister, opposed to invalidating their partner.", "I don't know how I'm reading so many Y T As. You took this BS for two days without complaining. You did your very best to not be confrontational in front of his family even though you had every right to. You only complained in the car to your boyfriend and somehow that's still not enough?\n\nPeople calling you TA are people who think it's worse to be labelled a racist than it is to suffer non stop racial objectification for two days.\n\nThe kid is not a monster or hitler youth material, but the way she treated you was racist. She let her obsession get over basic manners and some adult from her family should be letting her know her behaviour is not acceptable. I mean, she was taking pictures of you eating ?! What the hell. NTA a hundred times. You must have felt like your were the main attraction at the zoo.", "NTA lmao the comments are insane. Being a kpop fan and interested in the culture is one thing, being creepily obsessive and fetishizing koreans is a whole other thing. She may not have been malicious about it but she needs to learn that this is not acceptable behaviour and it's weird now that she's young. Not that it is OP's job to do this but damn.", "NTA.\nFrom the title I assumed something different, but no she makes you into a racial trope, Which is not OK.", "NTA \n\n13 is a good age for the little sister to learn about not fetishising people, which is what she was doing to you. She assumed that because you're Korean you must be into kpop, know all about the idols, and know how to do the dances she sees in kpop videos. \n\nYes, some of it was childish curiosity, but she crossed a line by taking photos of you, especially when you were eating, and treating you like a cardboard cutout, or her imagined, stereotypical and skewed version of what she thinks all Koreans must be like.\n\nI'm guessing that if you weren't Korean, or she wasn't into kpop, she would've just thought of you as her brother's girlfriend and treated you normally, instead of looking at you as some kind of shiny, exotic new toy that only existed for her edification. \n\nShe needs to be told that what she did and the way she treated you was racist, and that it made you deeply uncomfortable, because she wasn't seeing you as a human with your own agency. She wasn't even seeing you as her brother's SO. You were basically her My First Barbie: Korean Edition.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to tell his sister that her behaviour and attitude was disrespectful, that the way she treated you was racist, and that she doesn't get to use you to indulge her kpop fantasies. \n\nIf he's brushing this off, it might be time to think about the relationship moving forward, because if/when something like this happens again, it doesn't sound like he's going to be in your corner, especially when it comes to his family.", "NTA. The biggest thing that concerns me is that they aren\u2019t trying to correct her on certain things and to help her understand what behavior is okay and what isn\u2019t. She is the way she is because her family isn\u2019t trying to help her appreciate the culture and learn that she can ask questions and be interested without offending others. She\u2019s 13. He\u2019s acting like she\u2019s 7 or something.", "It sounds like you were racially objectified, and it's valid that you're not okay with it. \n\nNTA, because nobody gets to tell you what *you* find racist against yourself. If they aren't of Korean decent, they have no say in the matter.", "NTA. If people had to be fully aware that what they are doing is racist for it to count as racism, then no one would ever be called out and nothing would ever change.", "[removed]", "As someone who likes kpop, NTA. It\u2019s okay that she enjoys a particular genre of music, but at 13 she should know that taking pictures of people eating is entirely inappropriate, and making you do kpop dances is just weird. She clearly has a single stereotyped view of your whole culture, and someone needs to (gently) have a chat with her about how what she sees idols do is just a tiny snapshot of what it might mean to be Korean, and trying to make all Koreans she meets fit into that box is racist stereotyping, even if it\u2019s unintentional (which I\u2019m sure it is). I know how it feels when people say I look like every other mixed race person or start trotting out stereotypes about Black people around me, and she\u2019s doing the same thing to you OP, even if she doesn\u2019t mean to.", "Nta. It is such a weird behavior, and the people saying yta are definitely not subject of racism. It\u2019s very ignorant behavior to call a korean person like that, and the assumptions she made were very racist", "Ummmm NTA. At all !!!!\n\nI\u2019m part Thai and while it\u2019s not to this level, people still fetishize my ethnicity, romantically and platonically and ask me wild ass questions just bc I told them I\u2019m part Asian. I\u2019ve noticed with the rise of BTS especially (aka the last few years) , it\u2019s so much worse for Koreans. People do it to MY DOCTOR !!!!! \n\nThe picture taking while OP was eating was \u2026. crazy and not very appropriate & OP was super polite to go along with things. His sister may not realize how offensive she\u2019s being and maybe being checked will help her not make social faux pas like this in the future.", "NTA I'm Black American and White people do the same things to me sometimes it's really annoying and they don't seem to understand some of their actions although they may not be intentional can be a bit prejudice and racist", "I think I'd maybe say NAH.\n\nYou were absolutely being racially objectified, but I wouldn't be surprised if your boyfriend and her sister are totally unaware of why that behaviour was racist and what the context around a lot of it is. It doesn't make it ok, but a conversation about it might be helpful. \n\nBut then again it shouldn't be your job to educate people on their racist behaviour so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "NTA.  Her behavior was racist, but many people don\u2019t have a proper understanding of what racism is to appreciate that.", "I wouldn't call the unnie thing racist. But definitely cringe and creepy. Like a dude from somewhere else coming up to me and calling me honey or yummy and I'd be like across the street so fast.\n\nEverything else is a weird toeline between racist and creepy fanatic. Like I'm surprised you survived that.\nNta", "Going against the grain. NTA. You were obviously very uncomfortable with being her token Korean. It is a prejudice way to treat people, and I'm sorry you were uncomfortable all weekend.", "She is a tween. K-pop is marketed here to tweens.  She is extremely immature but and interested in the culture.\nI think your being a bit harsh.  However, someone should have told her she is being rude.", "She's not racist because she likes K-pop, she's racist because she's ignorant which could have easily been avoided if her mom or OP's bf educated her. She's still a kid, she does have time to unlearn these behaviours. OP, I know it isn't your job to educate her,  but it doesn't seem like your bf or her mom will, just incase you weren't aware. Now I'm so white that I don't tan in the summer, I burn in 5 minutes. That being said I'm honestly now wondering if I've been ignorant and racist previously in my life, but I have such a bad memory that I don't remember. I will make sure to watch myself now though, so I'm glad you posted this. I'm not glad that it happened, because nobody deserves to be stared at and treated like an animal. That said, your bf was brushing it off and it's been 6 months. My alarm bells are ringing, it seems like he doesn't care how you feel. I don't know how to end comments, so I guess thanks for reading?", "Ok all I'm going to say is wtf would a person take a photo of you while eating. That's rude and gross. No one wants a bad photo of themselves, like does she take pictures of everyone while they eat?! That's gross as F.", "NAH. She's 13 and obsessed with KPop. Knowing a few KPop fans, that's basically all they talk/think about. They're obsessed with the culture, not just the music/band members. You've BEEN to Korea. You're literally living this little girl's dream. Should she tone it down? Absolutely. Is it racist? No. Inappropriate? Slightly. But again. she's 13 and ignorant. Tell her she's making you uncomfortable and educate her (although her family should be the ones stepping in here), as we should be doing with children.\n\nRead the definition of racism. Was she using prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism to make you feel inferior? Sounds like she was idolizing you. You have information and experiences and a language she is dying to immerse herself in. Did you tell her not to call you unnie, or did you let it slide? How is she supposed to understand how that makes you feel unless you or someone tells her? People can't read minds, and a child doesn't inherently know better. A lot of people seem to think that racism is just the act of even acknowledging race.\n\nTell her you don't like KPop. That will shut her down.", "NTA. Korean here. O lord..she\u2019s a koreaboo lol. And yes her actions were so offensive. Clearly her intent wasn\u2019t but the behavior was so ignorant and creepy. Literally fetishizing you and Korean culture. Yikes. I cringed reading this \ud83d\ude33", "NTA - Wow, that sounds like a very frustrating and exhausting experience. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. I can relate to some of what you said because I\u2019m a Native American/Mexican woman and I\u2019ve faced similar situations before where people seem to think that Native and/or Mexican people are like this monolithic group and we all do and enjoy same things. You're definitely NTA for calling her racist because, despite seeming to not have harmful intent, her actions were racist. She needs to learn the difference between appreciation and appropriation, between curiosity and obsession, between admiration and fetishization. And she's definitely not too young at 13 to learn these things. Same goes for your boyfriend. He needs to learn these things too and have a conversation with his sister about it after he apologizes to you for being an ass. \n\nYou have every right to set boundaries and express your feelings. You don\u2019t have to tolerate or endure her harassment or microaggressions, no matter her intent. You deserve respect and dignity as a human being, not as an object of someone else\u2019s fantasy. Hopefully your boyfriend will meet with his family and address this issue so next time (if there is a next time) you go there you will have a more pleasant and appropriate experience.", "May get downvoted, but you're NTA.\n\nThe problem isn't that she \"likes\" K-pop, it isn't a problem that she knows choreo to her favourite group. The problem is the bf's sister reducing OP to a stereotype and calling her nicknames without ever actually checking if OP was okay with it.\n\n>She insisted on sitting next to me and she was taking photos of me eating because \"I looked like an idol\". \n\nThe sister is treating OP like a museum attraction, and that's not okay. Taking photos of someone and making them uncomfortable is NEVER okay, it doesn't matter how old the person is or what their intentions are, and if they are children or incapable of understanding then it is on the parents and/or family of that person to educate them. Stop putting the emotional labour on the people who've been made to feel uncomfortable in the first place.\n\n>I'm just trying to eat, her mother had to tell her to stop because I was very visibly uncomfortable.\n\n13 is old enough to start understanding social cues, and the mum (fortunately) stepped in.\n\nSo, the ultimate question, _was she racist?_ Yes. No matter how well intentioned she was, yes. You don't go up to black people with textured hair and ask to touch it because you think it's pretty. You don't start wearing bindi as per South Asian cultures without understanding the context and whether it's actually appropriate for you. You don't reduce Koreans down to a kpop stereotype and ignore their entirely individual personality and identity. She may not have been malicious, but it doesn't mean her behaviours are absolved, and her family (OP's bf) should be educating, not jumping down OP's throat when she expresses her concerns.", "NTA -- these comments haven't really experienced racism in any way that counts. OP is clearly pointing out that the sister never talked to her, or made any attempt to, interact with her in any way that wasn't about her race. All interactions were made on the a fetishised caricature of what the teenager assumed to represent the entirety of OP's character.\n\nIt's like that scene in Get Out where the Dad talks to the MC about \"Obama\" and rap and what not. It might not be palatable to average American, but feelings of exclusion and \"otherness\" that come with reinforced stereotypes are very much part of the racism that much of the immigrant diaspora perceives.\n\nAlso, news flash guys, this is coming from a hardcore ex-weeb herself, but 13 is OLD enough to be the AH in this situation. I was a anime-weeb; but I was also old enough to understand that people are feeling uncomfortable in a situation, and also try to talk to people about things that aren't my singular interest. Asshole, again, might be a stretch, but OP is in no way the wrong.\n\nEdit: also, with the logic of her just being a kid, children are never ever in the wrong because they don't mean it and they're just excited. The fact is, the same actions in someone just two years older would be borderline insane. You can be an asshole BECAUSE you're ignorant, because ignorance can harm other people. The only difference in children is, its easier to correct, and harder to blame on a inherent character flaw -- but for any real correction to occur, you have to admit that the sister is wholeheartedly in the wrong.", "NTA. Yeah she\u2019s only 13 but that sounds pretty out of control. Her parents need to educate her better and you telling your boyfriend that will hopefully get back to them.", "NTA. I don't know why K-Pop stans can't self-actualize, but there are so many in the comments here giving YTA verdicts that just did not read the post. \n\nTaking pictures of you while eating is crazy. So is bf for not agreeing with you. Get out of this relationship while you can, sister.", "ESH \nShe\u2019s 13. She\u2019s still a child. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a racist but who I think is T A here is the parents and your boyfriend for not correcting the behavior. But also, you didn\u2019t express anything to him all weekend until you left and then called her a racist? You have to communicate before you explode like that \nTo be real though, I don\u2019t see this relationship working out unless you guys communicate about this and get on the same page.\n\n\nEdited to add: explosion is not really the word about what she said. More about how her feelings built up over it over the entire weekend. Which is completely valid. If there was trust and communication in the relationship, she could have pulled the guy aside and talked to him about the issue before it went this far. I think it\u2019s too far now unfortunately. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to get back on the same page.", "I'll throw in an NTA because some of the things she said/did were definitely very ignorant. But I don't think she is the asshole either. Honestly, 13 year old fangirls can be a lot, and at that age some kids still don't always pick up on social cues well. \n\nThe assholes here are the adults in her life who did not correct her and just let her act like this because \"it's to be expected\". Your boyfriend should've been the first one to step in when you were uncomfortable and gently explain to her she was being obnoxious, and how her behavior could be interpreted. Her parents should also not be enabling her. Sounds like her family thinks it's cute that she's in her kpop fangirl phase and that's why she gets a pass, but they need to get a grip and intervene before it becomes a larger problem.", "I'd say NTA\n\nShe made you uncomfortable for the simple fact that you're korean. She excepts you to fit the standards that mass culture created for koreans. That's not blatant racism, but it's definitely internalised racism.\n\nI know it shouldn't be up to you, but I think that educating her about this would be a great thing. If she really is interested in korean culture (which I think I can safely state is much more than idols and choreographies), she will most likely take a step back and reconsider her behaviours.\n\nBut yeah, that's internalised racism.", "NTA. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated like a novelty around anyone, least of all family. Liking K-pop is obviously totally fine but taking pictures of you eating and getting excited about your race because you \u201clook like an idol\u201d is out of line. All the  people saying you\u2019re TA would likely have a different opinion if you were black and treated this way. It isn\u2019t okay.", "NTA, she was absolutely fetishizing you and treating you like a toy, not a person. That is racist behavior, whether she intended harm or not. You, the only person qualified to call out her behavior, expressed that you felt uncomfortable due to her actions and instead of acknowledging that the sister might be engaging in racist behavior, decided to attack you for being offended. \n\nBut you called her racist, which will always get a huge knee-jerk reaction out of non-POC (as evidenced here in the comment section).", "NTA, I am not sure she is racist but sure has some weird thing for Koreans. You are right to be mad and annoyed. That sounds like it was a terrible weekend. Your BF and his parents should be really embarrassed.\n\nPeople get super defensive if you say racist. She was 100% stereotyping you and Koreans.", "NTA. She may not be racist with hatred, but she's on the line of fetishizing a culture. She assumes you can dance Kpop, assumes you even know the language, she's using terms she isn't 100% sure of. She can learn from this, so hopefully she does.\n\nAlso, you're going to get a lot of comments from Kpop fans on this, beware.", "NTA and the people summarizing it as \u201cso liking K-pop is racist\u201d sound like hit dogs hollering. Making assumptions about someone based on their race, is racist. But \u2018racist\u2019 is not the end all be all, you can change and acting like her calling the kid that is the worst part of this post is delusional. If you are a poc and your bf is more mad at you calling his little sister a racist instead of correcting her when you are obviously uncomfortable with how she is treating you, throw the whole bf away.", "Assuming a person shares your obsession because of their race is a biased behavior and therefore, yes, racist. Sister and clearly BF were taught it is okay to treat someone based on race alone. \n\nNTA. Sister was inappropriate and needs to be taught that her behavior was hurtful. However, I suspect she is neurodivergent and also being 13, lacking social grace to see how uncomfortable it made you feel. BF is the asshole for gaslighting your experience. He doesn\u2019t get to tell you what feels like racial bias.", "NTA \nI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s with all the yta. Yes she\u2019s 13 but her behavior was racist. This could be an opportunity for your boyfriend to talk to her about it but instead he took offense. He warned you before hand so he definitely knew her behavior wasn\u2019t going to be the best. Taking pictures of you while you eat is so awful and I can only imagine how uncomfortable that must\u2019ve been. Definitely NTA", "NTA, anyone calling you an AH in these comments doesn\u2019t understand the concept of micro aggressions. White people in general get incredibly defensive when hearing the word racist so I think it was a poor choice of words, but also it\u2019s not your job to cater to white fragility. The behavior was racist and fetishizing, you called it out as such.\n\nIn response to comments I\u2019ve seen about her age:\n\nKids can also be racist. Racism is a part of American culture and discussing it is how we get rid of it. If you stop seeing racism as a character trait and see it as an issue that can and should be resolved with education, you would not be so bothered by the word.\n\n13 is also old enough to be called out for your behavior. I was racist at 13, I got called out, I became a better person. Racist is not a definition of who you are unless you choose not to change.

You are not an asshole, but you lack tact. You had a whole weekend to talk to the girl. But instead you lashed out. You could have been proactive and asked to speak to her with her brother.but you did not. Instead you dumped on the brother when he was on his way back to school. Nk one is perfect snd it is not your responsibility to fix her. But what did you expect from the brother when you call his little sister racist. She is obviously naive snd sheltered. Wouldn't it have been easier to tell her Korea is a big country. And just like here in the US, Koreans have lots of interests. Tell her that you don't listen or watch kpop. That you think it is cool that she does and you would like to hear more about it.

I do not make a practice of intentionally saying or doing anything that\u2019s racist.  But sometimes after conversations or interactions, I question if something I said was inappropriate.  \n\nWhat I\u2019ve taught my son is that intent and result are not always the same thing.  If you unintentionally offend someone, apologize.  Try to think of the conversation or situation from their perspective and recognize how you might have made them feel.  Little sister hasn\u2019t gotten that memo.\n\nI\u2019m going to guess that this family probably views racism as the use of slurs or derogatory stereotypes.  They don\u2019t recognize it in the \u201caccepted\u201d generalizations of other cultures.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s racist.  She engaged, without parental intervention, in racist behaviors.  She is ignorant and that\u2019s a result of her family\u2019s narrow perspective of what makes a thing racist.  But allowing her to feel like this is okay is a big step in the racist direction.\n\nBut you aren\u2019t ever the AH for calling out racist behaviors.", "She treated OP like she was a new shiny toy. Unacceptable", "Would you have been treated this way if you were a different race? No. The actions you experienced were exclusively due to your race, so you experienced racism. \n\n\nWhen I was in high school, I was the only Indian in a group of 5 white girls. I was ok at math but two of the girls were really good. I was more into art. But people would ask me for help with math. Did they mean bad? Were they mean? No. But it was incorrect and racist to assume that Indians are better at math. \n\n\nIt also got tiring correcting people because they saw me as a race not a person. As an example, my good friend's sister who I have known for 20 years apologizes to me when she talks about eating meat, to this day. She sees me,  assumes Hindu and then starts treating me differently. I'm not, I love red meat so it's frustrating when she offers me the vegetarian dishes instead of the meat she offers everyone else, especially since it's been 2 decades. \n\n\nIt sucks to be judged on looks/race, and even more sucks when that results in different treatment. Two full days of that is miserable.\n\n\nIn defense of the little girl, she probably wants so badly to be part of that culture and she never can be. She may have wanted your approval as her big brother's cool,  pretty girlfriend and then your being Korean, she misguidedly thought that would be how she should interact.

Why do I have to teach people that people that look different then you are people as well?", "NTA. I think it was sweet that she said hello in Korean. The intent was obvious that she cares about learning about you and hoped to make you comfortable. As a 13 year old, that was thoughtful. The rest was not. It was wrong and rude and her parents need to teach her better.", "NTA and thank you for sharing because I see a lot of people in the comments coming to terms with the fact that racism is not always a screaming hate filled caricature. I\u2019ve struggled for years to explain that the people expecting that they know what kind of music/food/fashion I like just because of the color of my skin is also dehumanizing. It robs you of your individuality. His sister is only 13 and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d have been receptive to being corrected had her mom or brother explained this to her. Frankly I can\u2019t believe no one stepped in for you. I hope he sees your point of view.", "NTA, but I think you\u2019re fighting a losing battle trying to make your bf see your side.

I was pretty shocked at how appalled he was, since this happens all the time. My wife, who\u2019s half Asian half white, chimed in and mentioned that people will frequently call her \u201cexotic\u201d to her face, which he was also appalled by. As the day went on, I could tell he was deep in thought, clearly digesting the fact that as a white man, theres a layer of human interaction that he just has never been aware of. The point is, you and your bf live in completely different worlds where he lacks the tools to understand what is happening, and is unwilling to spend the time to develop a deeper understanding. I hesitate to call your bf an asshole, because I understand it\u2019s scary to have your worldview and your view of your family be challenged like that. But at the same time, once he calms down a little bit you should continue to push this issue because it is important. Your partner doesn\u2019t necessarily need to \u201cget it\u201d right away. But he absolutely does need to make an effort to \u201cget it\u201d for a long term future to work out. You need a partner who is on your team 100%, and that cannot happen if your partner is willfully blind to the ways other people (and especially his family) make you feel otherwise.", "Imitation is the sincerest form of Flattery, YTA for calling his sister racist.\n\nAnd I get it, I\u2019m half Japanese living in a country that\u2019s 96% white and I get questions all the time but it\u2019s usually from adults and they aren\u2019t trying to be offensive but curious about me and my background and culture.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t being racist, probably trying to be welcoming, but a bit overzealous because she\u2019s interest in Korean Music and Culture.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty demeaning and derogatory to call someone racist for being overly enthusiastic to meet you.", "While you are technically correct, the word \"racist\" has such strong connotations that it's kinda overly harsh to apply it to this.

Loving Korean music (and food and culture and language) is absolutely NOT racist.\n\nBeing an AH to a person of Korean descent *because of their race* IS racist. However, for kids, we call it out, explain why it's inappropriate to make assumptions based on heritage or looks, and work toward making sure those AH moments do not grow into racism. So you suck a little bit for just going along, not treating this girl as a human being capable of learning, and then complaining to your boyfriend only afterward. This did not have to go on for two days; even if you were nonconfrontational upon first meeting, you had time to tell your boyfriend how uncomfortable you felt and ask him to talk to his sister, or to *tell her yourself*. You are not a child.\n\nIf you don't like kpop, tell her so. Tell her no when she pushes for something inappropriate. Answer those questions honestly, that you aren't into that and don't know the dances or whatever.

Many of the things she's doing would be racist in other context or from someone with more life experience, but I expect she'd do similar things if her obsession was with German techno and you had a German accent.

I'm not Korean but I understand the frustration of having your whole culture reduced to a couple of things that have become globally popular and assuming all people's identity within that culture is based on those . However, this is a 13 yo kid super excited about all things Korean and I think it would have been an excellent opportunity for you to get to know her and start educating her and show her that Korean culture goes beyond the whole entertainment and idol/kpop industry. I mean, whether you like it or not, she is his sister and if your relationship continues, you're most likely gonna see her again. Of course, establish any boundaries you feel comfortable with (being recorded/photographed while eating sucks) but be gentle and age appropriate with her, please.

An older brother (25), sister (13) and brother (9). \n\nThe problem with his sister is that apparently she's a kpop fan. My boyfriend had already told me this prior to meeting her and he told me to get \"ready\". I thought that meant that she would ask me to say something in Korean or something like that (it has happened to me before even by strangers in the street, it's annoying). Well, first things first she greeted me with an \"hello\" in korean, I faked a laugh and greeted her too. \n\nIt wouldn't have been such a deal if that was it, but then she continued calling me \"unnie\" and asking me if I called my boyfriend \"oppa\" and such things. She then started asking where did I lived when I was in Korea, if I had met any idols, if I ever tried to be an idol myself, etc. She insisted on sitting next to me and she was taking photos of me eating because \"I looked like an idol\". Like, what does that even mean? I'm just trying to eat, her mother had to tell her to stop because I was very visibly uncomfortable. After eating she wanted me to go dance some kpop choreographies with her because you know, every Korean knows how to dance I guess. We stayed there over the weekend so it was two days of not stop of this kind of behavior.\n\nI was so glad when it was time to leave. As soon as we pulled out the driveway I told my boyfriend \"you were not kidding, your sister is worse than I imagined\" he laughed and said it was \"expected\" of her to act like this. So I told him \"so she's always this racist huh?\" He took offense on that, he told me that his sister wasn't racist at all, she was only excited to met me. I said that all she did during our visit was to make assumptions about me and talk to me in a racist way (like c'mon, calling me unnie when she doesn't even know the context of the word has to be racist for Americans too right?). \n\nNow he's mad at me, I am mad at him too for not understanding my side too.

I do not think \"racist\" is the correct term, as the sister was not being negative, or antagonistic against Koreans. It's simply ignorance, and that can be changed with communication and education.\n\nFirstly, I understand the irritation of people's ignorance, especially with the Hallyu wave that has happened over the last 10 years. Korean culture, and music have risen to an insane international hype. People get super excited to meet Koreans, and only know what's been shown in media, like on the \"All Kpop\" site or even Buzzfeed, and tiktok.\n\nI get flustered when people approach me about Korea and the culture. I have had to educate myself on Korean culture to better connect with my homeland. I always tell people that educating yourself on a culture is really useful, and that I cannot speak on Korean culture, as I haven't lived there since infancy.\n\nIt sounds like the sister was super hyped to speak to someone from Korea. At 13, when I was super into anime, and met other Asian folks (was raised in the south, so very little Asian people around me growing up), I'd get super excited, not only to be around someone that looked like me, but who maybe shared the same interests, but would occasionally be incorrect.\n\nIt sounds like the sister wanted to greet you in your native language, which I think is endearing. For instances where she was using Korean in the wrong manner, you could have either politely explained the purpose of \"Unnie\" and \"oppa\" to her, or have politely recommended sources to better learn more about Korean language.\n\nI know it isn't your responsibility to educate her, however if it bothers you, correcting her ignorance in a polite way is a simple enough way to have her stop.\n\nI think it would be different if she was an older teen, but at 13, when I was super excited at the prospect of connecting with someone who might be someone that I could talk to about cultural or fandom stuff, the excitement can overshadow manners. Who is to say she isn't somewhat neuro-divergent and didn't pick up on the awkwardness.\n\nI don't think the sister did anything out of malice at all. I think what needs to happen is more communication with your boyfriend on why such things bother you, and either you or him may be able to sit with the sister, and also explain why such behavior can be overwhelming and offensive.", "Here is a little girl who is completely in love with Korean culture, and she gets to meet her first \"real, live!\" Korean.

And I tend to view racism from an individual and systemic racism as two different (but related) things. I'm not saying or insisting that's right, just where I'm at.\n\nFrom there, what I imagine is people see that OP called her boyfriend's sister racist, and got hyperfocused on that instead of the fact that no matter what you call it, OP was treated poorly and no one did anything about it.\n\nFor what it's worth, without reading this thread, I wouldn't have called the sister's actions racist, but I'd still have said OP is NTA because holy shit, that sounds exhausting to deal with. And at some point someone should have told the sister to cut it out and explained why what she was doing wasn't kind to OP, and it definitely shouldn't have had to be OP. Or ideally, the boyfriend or his parents should have talked to his sister ahead of time since this was probably predictable.\n\nI think a lot of it has to do with how we're taught about racism growing up (or at least how I was taught about it). It's very focused on racism bad, and clear individual actions that are clearly racist being used as examples. And it's also very focused on racism against black people, because, well, that's the most in your face racism has been in the U.S. (from a white person's perspective at least)\n\nEssentially, we teach racism as a moral failing, rather than a set of actions, behaviors, and systems that negatively impact people from disadvantaged groups. And people internalize that, so when people are called racist, they hear that they're being accused of having a moral failing, not that they did something that hurt the other person.\n\nWhich goes back to the above. When OP called her boyfriend's sister racist, I believe she meant the sister had caused her discomfort based on actions that were taken due to her race. What OP's boyfriend likely heard was that she was saying his sister has a moral failing. And I suspect the Y.T.A. voters interpreted it that way as well and felt that saying the sister had a moral failing was an incorrect assessment of her bad behavior.\n\nSorry if this is rambling...

Just that it's ignorant.", "How about stereotyping someone due to their race?\n\nThe boyfriend's sister assumed that because OP is Korean, they must be in to KPop and know the dances/idols(??) etc. That is like assuming a Black person likes watermelon because they are Black.", "i would argue its not even xenophobia its just her idolizing the part of korean culture she was exposed to. His sister is 13 shes curious about another culture and shes meeting someone from that culture. \n\nfor reference lets breakdown xenophobia as a word. the second half is phobia which means fear. There's no fear here just idolization. OP is literally getting offended by someone who one has called her rather attractive and 2 has a misconception about the culture of another country. At the worst she was just overbearing for op. Which in a sense is an american cultural thing. We are usually overbearing to most other cultures in our demeanor.", "I think we white Scots have a different perception of racism. We see racism as people using slurs or committing hate crimes against other ethnicities. I see a girl admiring OP and showing love, whereas others are saying it\u2019s racist ignorance.

Sure, if you're ready for it and know what to expect and how to counter each action. Also very easy to say after the fact. Should the kids be taught better? Of course. Do I blame the kid's family for not bringing it up in the moment? Also not at all.", "They may have after OP left. We don\u2019t know.

It doesn\u2019t sound like that was the case for OP.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have at least one other person on your side, these conversations can easily turn into a dogpile. People usually get defensive about this stuff, regardless of how nice you are about it. If OP had tried to say something and the sister had become upset, it\u2019s pretty reasonable to assume the family would have leapt to her defense. Then, boom, it\u2019s a 3v1 scenario and everyone is uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, generally, if people are behaving badly, they don\u2019t like being called out in the moment, by a stranger, in a group setting. It would have been much more conducive to the sister\u2019s learning if OP\u2019s boyfriend had taken the time to listen to her and then speak to the sister one-on-one.

The brother/boyfriend getting riled up after she was visibly uncomfortable to the point of the MOM stepping in doesnt stand well in my opinion. The boyfriend should have stepped in and explained to the sister that she\u2019s making OP uncomfortable. It\u2019s his family.

How to use toilets, and how to interact appropriately with those around them.

That would be super weird and uncomfortable, but obviously the kid liked her and was excited to meet her. It would have been an excellent time to have a sit down and talk about racism and the correct way to inquire about other cultures and interact with people of other cultures and races appropriately. \n\nI think the family were kinda AHS for letting the kid carry on like that when it was probably pretty obvious how uncomfortable OP was.\n\nNTA OP but this is definitely the time to have a real conversation with your SO.", "Exactly! I am Asian too and have had many people ask me about my culture the same way the 13 year old did. And I have also asked questions of people in other cultures too because of what I know from pop culture, but that doesn\u2019t make me racist. It was a chance for me to learn from them and vice versa and once the novelty wore off, I did not see them as different anymore. \n\nI think the 13 year old was curious and was not exposed to a real life Korean. Honestly, I think OP missed the opportunity to explain to her if she was that offended by the 13 year old who likes K-pop.", "NTA\n\nYes, I was thinking this too. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to shoulder the burden of immersing lil sister into the reality of Korean culture, but it can be clearly stated and bf can step in and do the rest. \n\nSimilar but not the same: All Soldiers wear a uniform\u2026did an event at an elementary school during the duty day (long time ago) and this sweet little girl *INSISTED!* that I worked with her dad because we wore the same uniform.

And being called out on it, with the sensitivity it deserves is exactly how you learn not to do or say those things and why.\nJust calling a young child racist isn't going to solve anything and it's incredibly mean to boot.", "I don\u2019t think it should be totally on OP and minorities to explain. It\u2019s not fair for them. It\u2019s really big that people educate themselves on these issues.

She told her bf who may be in a position to kindly talk to his sister about her racist behaviour and get her to change. \n\nThe 13 year old isn't racist for liking kpop or Korean culture. Her behaviour toward OP was super racist though. She can like kpop without treating OP like some kind of entertaining trinket.", "This kind of reaction is unfair to the people who have to put up with this kind of racism, and also to the kids who aren\u2019t being properly corrected.\n\nI know the \u201cracism\u201d label is uncomfortable.

And they won\u2019t learn to stop unless it\u2019s called out for what it is.\n\nIn this case, the 13-year-old sister is obviously being racist. She\u2019s not being malicious, but she is objectifying OP because of her race. It\u2019s the same exact same thought process as white dudes who sexualize all Asian women. And here, the sad part is that white fragility around being called racist is hurting everyone. Things don\u2019t get better for OP. But also, the sister won\u2019t learn that this is not the way to genuinely connect with Koreans and Korean culture (which she\u2019s obviously interested in doing).", "I can understand your opinion on this. I do think obsession borders on racism, especially in this manner. I do think it is harsh to call a 13 year old racist, but it might be a wake up call for her to realize that it is indeed wrong to categorize an entire group of people based on the pop culture. I do think it approached a weird territory when the sister insisted that OP calls her boyfriend oppa, since it does have a weird connotation in pop culture.", "You are picking up on a difference that most people are ignoring in their rush to call an eager 13 year old kpop fan \"racist.\"  She is obsessed with a CULTURE.  She is asking the GF questions because the GF is from Korea, not because she's genetically Korean.  \n\nIf the sister knew the GF was born and raised in the States with no ties to Korea and she still asked about all these things about culture in Korea, that would be a little more troubling.  But to talk about Korean culture with someone FROM Korea is not racist.  \n\nAnd worse, I think the word racist is getting diluted when it's applied in a case like this.  Look, every reasonable person is against racism.    But when we start calling everything we don't like \"racist\" when it's actually about culture or something else, it's just as crazy as the right wing calling everything they don't like \"socialist.\"  It doesn't do anything to fight against racism.  It just takes a kid who is in love with a culture and tries to make her an asshole.", "I mean, the sister was still being overtly fetishist. As an Asian person myself, I am completely comfortable saying that the sister\u2019s actions were racist. She was clearly orientalising and objectifying OP.\n\nTo me, sister\u2019s age doesn\u2019t matter. Her intention doesn\u2019t, either. The fact that sister\u2014or anyone\u2014believes that fetishism is a type of \u201ccultural appreciation\u201d is a massive issue. Intent here doesn\u2019t matter. This was a RACIST interaction.

They have a very narrow view of what qualifies as racism, so the more subtle and nuanced manifestations of it are entirely lost on them. It's the same for other forms of oppression too: homophobia, misogyny, ableism, etc.\n\nAfter a while it gets tiring having to explain the same thing over and over to people who aren't interested in actually listening.", "I think it might also make the person you are asking feel uncomfortable in some situations, like they need to defend themselves and you are disagreeing with them saying something is racist (even though that may not be the intent). \n\nSome people may have a hard time expressing themselves in these situations as well. For example, if I have extreme anxiety problems and I\u2019m able to tell you hey that thing you said is making me uncomfortable and is racist, that step there may be a huge deal and something new for the person, we can\u2019t know really. So, asking for more from them could be asking too much in a way, if that makes sense. I am not saying this is everyone, of course, but something I think about in a lot of situations like maybe it was really hard to call something out but that\u2019s as far as they\u2019re prepared to go. \n\nSome people may not want to have to explain why something is racist and speak for their group of people, etc. \n\nBeing a porcelain skinned lady, I haven\u2019t dealt with anything near to what others do on a daily basis so I am just brainstorming here, really. If I don\u2019t understand something, and I know the person enough, I do ask for more information as well. I try to show that I am being sincere and want to learn and make changes.

I have a friend who it took  6 years from 16 (when I met him) to 22 to get him out of his horrifically cringe inducing Japan phase like this and it had been well entrenched by that point.  We took Japanese together, and it took a Japanese student studying abroad to tell him that some of the things he was proud of were not things to be proud of in Japan.  Now he has a real not fad appreciation of tbe culture, isn't blind to the downsides, and has started to branch out.\n\nShe will grow out of it, eventually, but it is better to start the process now by calling out the behavior and nipping it in the bud and turning it into a real appreciation for the culture and traditions.  OP, I would reccomend using the obsession to bring about something positive, but also explain to her why what she did wasn't right and offer to show her some of the other amazing things about Korean culture.", "Welcome to being in an interracial relationship. Things sometimes are ugly because we all have internalized racism. We all have to deal with the fact that our families and friends may also be racist and we didn't realize it. \nShe did explain how she felt. She felt his sister was racist because his sister was in fact racist.", "To me there is an important difference between calling a child *a* racist, especially to their face, and what happened here, which was that OP correctly identified to her BF that his sister was acting racist.\n\nI don't blame the child for her ignorance. Her family has not yet provided her with sufficient insight or experience for how to treat others well in light of the nuances of cross-cultural curiosity. Now they know better and should do better, especially the BF who has been made aware of his sister's racist impact on OP.", "Intentions don't negate impact. She fetishized the OP for two days. The OP was kind. When she explained the situation to her BF, he could have used this as an opportunity to learn and to teach his sister. This taking the onus off the OP.\nHe's in an interracial relationship. This is going to happen. He needs to listen to the OP and occasionally educate people for her.", "13 yo can be so clueless.  I think her parents need to have a talk with her and give her some examples by reversing the situation and asking her how she'd feel if she went to another country and those people did the same thing to her - treating her like she was a some kind of toy for her entertainment.", "There\u2019s no expectation for white people to educate themselves, at least where I am. But every POC is expected to learn the culture so they can \u201cfit in\u201d to company standards or other things. I think that many people think that after school they stop learning but really you never stop learning until you pass. You shouldn\u2019t yell at someone \u201cgo educate yourself\u201d but you should lead them to how to educate themselves. I do think that POC shouldn\u2019t be the \u201cteachers\u201d but more of a tutor or a mentor. They start a path that you finish trailing.", "It\u2019s not naive at all. It\u2019s 2023. Maybe not literal kids but all adults young and old have no excuse.", "I think the point (or problem, more accurately) is that it should be the boyfriends job and not the responsibility of POC, but since the boyfriend won't even acknowledge the racism, the unfortunate reality is that either OP educates her or she doesn't get the education and she keeps being racist. It shouldn't be that way, but I think it is. I would love a third option where we smack the boyfriend with a proverbial stick, he admits it's racist, and deals with it... But how?", "I\u2019ve done research. I\u2019ve listened to people who are in my life. Yes I\u2019ve seen some things from people online, but I also go into papers (research and just \u201cfun\u201d papers). I might not be the most educated person, and I still struggle with prejudice that I learned when I was young. Thank you for informing me on my need for more education from different sources.", "The 13 year old might do this to every Korean person forced to spend time in her presence, which is close enough to \"always\" or at least it's every time it matters. \n\nJust because it's not malevolent racism and just because she's kinda a stupid kid doesn't make how she acts magically not racist. She reduced OP to a series of stereotypes based on her ethnicity.

We can avoid calling the sister *A Racist* - like the swastika wearing embodiment of the term because I don\u2019t think anyone here is saying that they think the sister has hatred in her heart and that\u2019s all people can see when they think of that term. But there should be full acknowledgment that her actions were in fact, absolutely, definitely 100% racist. She acted in a racist way or showed some racist behaviour. It may have come from a place of ignorance but that doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t being racist because she\u2019s ignorant it means she WAS being racist because she\u2019s ignorant! It doesn\u2019t matter that she didn\u2019t mean to make OP feel bad because the outcome was that she did. As white allies we would all do much better if we could admit that we sometimes do racist things, and we definitely benefit from structural racism. Because if you can\u2019t admit that then how can you ever try to learn why/how you should not do that?\n\nOP came in harsh with the \u2018so she\u2019s always that racist huh\u2019 to her boyfriend because she was frustrated that he clearly was completely unable to see why the way his sister behaved was really problematic. And then he doubled down - he should know that if his POC girlfriend tells him something is racist then he doesn\u2019t get to say \u2018no it isn\u2019t\u2019. He does not know better. I understand his immediate response was to defend his sister who clearly was not coming from a place of malice but he is continuing to refuse to reflect on it or learn from the experience. As a POC she needs to know that her partner \u2018gets\u2019 it, and will stand up on her behalf when appropriate without having to be told it\u2019s needed. Her boyfriend should have known that this was racist and not a funny little quirk. And at 13 too\u2026. I had to go back because I thought we must be talking about the 9 year old. \n\nHe should have probably had a chat about all the ways you can be racist with his sister before hand given here clearly knew she was likely to behave like this, or if not then immediately nipped it in the bud as soon as it started. That doesn\u2019t mean jumping down her throat with finger pointing and yells of being A RAAACCCIIIISSSTTT but more a calm conversation about fetishisation, orientalism, appropriation, stereotyping, objectification, making assumptions about people you meet based purely on ethnicity, reducing an entire culture or even set of cultures down to one small thing and then glorifying it etc etc and how all of those behaviours can be racist. I bet it wouldn\u2019t take long to even find a Korean YouTuber talking about all this stuff if both of them needed to learn these lessons together!\n\nAnd I understand both sides of the argument with the it is/isn\u2019t OPs job to educate. On one hand, if you don\u2019t explain it to people you might be missing a chance for them to learn and become a better ally, or to understand you better. But on the other hand, imagine it being assumed that you are a teacher, a spokesperson and advocate every time you walk in to a room JUST because you have a skin tone that isn\u2019t white. It\u2019s fair enough that sometimes you might just want to exist as a POC without your skin tone meaning anything, or coming with an obligation to make other people better.", "I wish more takes were as nuanced as this. I agree completely. The 13 year old needs to be educated on what's appropriate. Being labeled a racist is not helpful to that end. It's clear she's doing it out of ignorance. A better tack is to be gracious and assume good faith and then educate.\n\nThe racist label is such a loaded term and throwing it around at every situation like this can sometimes be really counterproductive. I think a lot of racism like that displayed by this 13 year old is innocent ignorance. So handle it with grace and kindness. I doubt this 13 year old would have continued the behavior if they knew it was offensive to Koreans. But no one told her, so how would she know? She's 13!\n\nHonestly. The world would b a lot better place if we'd all slow down, assume good faith and try to talk to each other with kindness.\n\nIf the kid won't listen... then start using the racist label.", "This is exactly how I read it! The girl never called her a slur or talked to her negatively, but the trailing and stereotyping definitely falls into that \u201cquasi-racism\u201d corner.", "Thank you.  It's really disheartening.  There's a lack of critical thinking skills.", "I think there\u2019s also reflection in who you are asking.  It\u2019s often not just annoying but dehumanizing to have to justify why you shouldn\u2019t be othered all the time.  There are plenty of books, videos and other resources on the subject that don\u2019t require marginalized people to carefully and kindly teach those who have harmed them.  If you want to invest in your own education to do that, I certainly support it, and it doesn\u2019t have to be at the expense of the person you just microaggressed.", "Love the history!  I knew some of it but never knew the details.  Thank you for sharing!", "As an American, if I went to France and a kid said \"hello\" in English and asked me if I know Kevin Bacon, I can't imagine being upset about that.  \"Do you know X celebrity\" is a weird question, but is it offensive?  I guess I don't understand how that's offensive.", "If you were obsessed with country music and your only exposure to America was the culture around country music and you were 13, it's very likely that when you met an American for the first time, you would expect them to also be into this huge thing from America.", "Yes omg this is what I'm trying to explain. Like asking someone about their background is not the same as asking them to do KPop choreo with you lol. The kid almost definitely didn't mean to be offensive but she still has to learn that it's not okay to racially profile people (which is what this is whether the qualities in question are viewed as positive or negative)", "But then being Korean isnt a race same as Scottish isnt. The comparison is white and asian. The sister was treating Op based on her country of origin not race. So if Op had been Japanese the sister would not have gone about the Kpop stuff.\n\n\u2014Also not debating what the sister did was inappropriate. \n\nEdit- just saw this exact sentiment below!", "I've only ever experienced people from other cultures being happy when others try to say words in their language and take an interest in their culture.  They love it.  OP is Korean but she is also now American.  I highly doubt a true Korean person living in Korea would be offended.  And this has been concurred by my husband who is Korean.   I think annoyance is very different from racism.", ">because I thought that having white skin made me a neutral observer instead of an active participant.\n\nThis.

It would be considered as such if it were a bunch of white people in the states; it's the same elsewhere.", "Honestly that is racist lol I don't know why you're saying its not. There have been plenty of videos of people from Asian cultures crowding around black people and snapping pictures like they're zoo animals. That's literally racism. \n\nAsian countries are generally very isolationist and xenophobic, so while most of the racism is subtle and comes from a place of ignorance, it doesn't mean its not literally racist. In fact, its one of the most textbook examples of racism. It's of similar ilk to slave traders parading round black women in their home countries because of their different body types.", "Well the 13 y.o. def wasn't getting the cues. She was too enthused. Don't expect OP to do it as she was the guest and that would make an bad impression, so it really was on the family members to have sis step back a bit.

You say the BF has been made aware, but I think the odds of him being open to understanding are significantly lowered when his young sister is essentially insulted, called one of the worst insults in fact. And not just \"racist\" but \"always this racist\". I think he should be open to it, but who knows, clearly he himself isn't as aware so it might just make him shut himself out of discussion right out the gate.\n\nAnd my point is also that waaaay too many people in this thread are just saying \"NTA, racist child\", when I think that is worse than just saying nothing, if you just leave it there.", "And so what if that 13 year old sister said that to another 13 year old Korean girl?

Should I call the next POC that calls me black and assumes that I know American black culture a racist because while I have been blessed in the melonine department I am mostly German. I could tell you more about being \"white\" then I could about being black because all the poc I've encountered has slammed me so hard with racism that I actively avoid associating with black people in particular, because they have not welcomed me at all because I can't relate and I \"am a disgrace to black people and need to stop betraying my black brothers and sisters by acting so white\".

And how could she, unless she is corrected on her behaviour, which clearly didn't happen. \n\nReddit loves to call people racist, and often we are right, but in this case I ask you wtf the point is, if that's where the discussion ends. Clearly OP needs to communicate what went wrong and why, and hope her BF and his parents understand and educate the kid. Otherwise we are just calling children racists for the sake of it. Does it even really matter whether or not it's racism if we can pretty much all agree that such behaviour should be corrected?", "Since South Korean isn\u2019t a race and this all has to do with cultural stereotypes from a specific East Asian country is racism really the correct word?", "How do you educate someone that their behaviour is racist without calling it racist?", "This is apologia, not nuance. Yeah, the kid just needs to be educated and not sent directly to jail or anything, but refusing to call a spade a spade is exactly how bf ended up in a situation where his gf has to tell him that his sister treated her like a Foreign Curio.

I had a few reasons why I view it this way. Before I get to the reasons I want to acknowledge that yes impact, not intent is valid, however:\n\n1. Your title is misleading. Your question including kpop makes it sounds slightly rediculous. Sounds like she is a typical teenager who is interested in something. Around that age, I remember music becoming a bigger and bigger part of my life. You start to explore everything out there. Just because someone likes a genre of music from a different country doesn't make someone racist.\n\n2. The girl is 13 years old. When you were 13, were you aware of every social construct that you needed to tip-toe around especially immigrating to a new country? Or had you met someone from every other country or ethnic group and knew how to act perfectly? It appears to me in your description of events, that she thought you might know the stars from there might have just been an innocent assumption. Maybe you grew up in the same neighbourhood and crossed paths. But given that the US is 99x the size of South Korea, with between 6 and 7 times the population, the place could be considered small, and even smaller if you start to take into account how concentrated populations in cities are and exclude the land used for other functions such as crops or just natural mountains and forests. So her assumption has some merit.\n\n3. She is the only girl child in the family. Your boyfriend is likely someone she looks up to considering he is almost twice her age. So when someone you admire brings someone into the family, a normal reaction from a younger sibling would be interest in the new partner, not to mention she likely saw it as finally having a sister and not two brothers to deal with. Probably something that she's potentially wished for.\n\n4. From the way you wrote this, the fact that you couldn't be bothered to appreciate the effort put in by a young child to try to speak to you in your mother tongue (I assume Korean is what you originally learned and spoke before immigrating) when it's not a language taught in the US (that I know of). Not to mention your assumptions about dancing. Sounds like she just wanted to do something with you, and in particular something that she likes. Did she make you teach her a dance or put you center stage and tell you to dance for her? Would it have been different if she asked you to come square dancing with her? Will you scoff at her asking you to go draw or play video games, because you know, all Koreans are good at that /s.\n\n5. In this whole situation, you waited until you got into the car when you were leaving to address the issue. And not in a nice way, with jumping straight to racist. Why is it that you, an adult, didn't address this with your boyfriend, who might have been able to deal with it indirectly if you weren't comfortable addressing it directly? Further to that, why weren't you acting like an example, explaining to her why these things might be taken the wrong way by someone?\n\nI just don't understand how you're so judgemental of a 13-year-old who from the sounds of it acted like a normal kid who was showing interest and some affection towards you when first meeting her older brother's new girlfriend. From my point of view, based on your description of events, it makes it sound like your first impression wasn't that great, and if this is how you reacted to your boyfriend, you might not have to deal with the racist 13-year-old for much longer.", "While her actions were inappropriate, she wasn't being racist.

I hope someone can sit down sister and encourage her to learn more about different aspects of Korean culture, outside of kpop, and I hope that she can learn how to be more sensitive bringing up those topics to Korean culture.

You can call it whatever you want, but OP was stereotyped and treated differently based on her heritage and that\u2019s wrong.

If she\u2019s the golden child, he knows that his parents are not only *not* going to address her bad behavior, they are going to *blame him* for OP being upset. It seems like one or both of these two things are what\u2019s causing the bf\u2019s reaction:\n1) his sister is the golden child and can do no wrong. Sure, she might be annoying sometimes, but that\u2019s just how she is! She\u2019s perfect and shouldn\u2019t change, we all just have to deal with it!

Like it\u2019s not on the 13 yo because she doesn\u2019t know what she doesn\u2019t know, but the bf should have told his sister in advance that OP isn\u2019t in to K-pop and to take it easy *AND* the parents/bf should have reeled her in as soon as OP expressed discomfort and redirected the conversation. If I\u2019m meeting my boyfriend\u2019s 13 yo sibling for the first time and they\u2019re basically treating me as their personal entertainment for any reason, I\u2019m probably going to be annoyed, even without any offensive undertones.

Why are we trying to discourage support and appreciation?", "Sure if an adult had done all those things and if OP hadn\u2019t been her brothers (apparently serious) girlfriend I\u2019d be way more accepting of a lot of the GFs reaction. But. \n\nThis girl was excited 13 and trying to connect. Who doesn\u2019t try to connect awkwardly when they\u2019re 13 heck I\u2019m 50. I\u2019m still awkward.  Maybe OP gets reacted to like this a lot and yes I\u2019m sure that is annoying because she\u2019s clearly annoyed. There are layers. There are layers of relationships, the surface, the group and then the person. I am sad because this little girl was enthused about you and your culture and instead of taking that enthusiasm and deepening knowledge so that she doesn\u2019t repeat the behavior or does it in a more socially and culturally appropriate way a bitter taste was put in. \n\nI want you to recognize that you were welcomed, however clumsily. I think that\u2019s more important than everything. You can always educate people if they want to like you and they are excited about some thing - cultural education is a thing and I just don\u2019t understand why you would be so bitter about a child trying to connect with you for the first time. Everyone will learn, but people don\u2019t always know. \n\nTeach them but don\u2019t judge them especially if they\u2019re open to learning which you don\u2019t even know because you didn\u2019t try. if they don\u2019t want to learn then they\u2019re the asshole. \n\nif they didn\u2019t behave correctly but with the best of intentions, then you\u2019re the asshole. Technically called racism sure but intentions should matter imho. It doesn\u2019t turn their actions into the correct ones but it makes them correctable. In which case I don\u2019t understand sour attitudes in this case because they will learn-  unless you\u2019re looking for a reason to break up. Unless u don\u2019t want to teach them which I can imagine would be tiring if you have to keep on doing it, but you can turn these people into a safe place. It doesn\u2019t sound like they spectate would be unwilling if you don\u2019t judge them for not knowing. And I know this is not r/relationship but I think that\u2019s more important than the technical racist not racist determination. \n\n(Culturally saying someone is racist in America has a lot of negative harsh historical overtones which changes by area of the country. It\u2019s not said lightly or received lightly and it\u2019s impossible to remove those overtones.

I totally agree with this comment and it's mention of communicating who to what so that everyone has all the info and can grow from there (although it's not OPs job to do all the communicating).\n\n I especially agree with the comment about re-evaluating the relationship. Part of being in an inter-racial relationship is doing the work (on understanding the nuances of racism) and listening and then *believing* the partner when they say they've experienced racism.

Can\u2019t phrase how I feel better than you did. I\u2019m first generation and I don\u2019t think this is \u201cracist\u201d.

She's learning about Korea through KPOP, and it's unfortunate that's inherently race related. Actions and behaviors can be racist, but not racially motivated, and she's definitely not a bigot.\n\nIf no one corrects her she won't know she's making anyone uncomfortable. If no one around her can teach her, she won't learn how to detach race from things like culture, fandom, nationality, cuisine, etc. People usually figure it out over time but they stumble to get there.", "I disagree, racism doesn\u2019t always come from malice and people (especially kids) can pick up on racial stereotypes completely innocently. She was objectifying and making strange assumptions about OP based purely on her being Korean, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inappropriate to call it racist. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s malicious or a monster or anything, she was obviously just overexcited like you said and doesn\u2019t have much experience with Korean people other than the stereotypes she\u2019s familiar with.\n\nPeople have just been getting too sensitive about the word \u2018racist\u2019 and assume being accused of doing one racist thing is the same as being called an irredeemably horrible person when that\u2019s just not what the word means. It was accurate here and OP is NTA for using it and I think focusing so much on the semantics of the word rather than that she was made super uncomfortable is the main problem in the communication between her and her bf.", "It really isn't. As a Korean, unni of \uc5b8\ub2c8 can be fairly casual. When you go to a restaurant, you call your server as unni even though she's a complete stranger because it is a little bit warmer to call her than lady.\nAlso, it would be rude if your boyfriend's 12 year sister didn't call you unni. By being the gf of her brother, you automatically command respect as an elder. I don't know why others say unni is a word reserved only for very close people when in Korean culture it's fairly casual.", "So you believe there are two types of racism and yet say it was wrong for OP to be upset/irritated/annoyed at the little sister for being racist? Sure, ignorance is everywhere but the only way for people to stop being ignorant is to be called on it and educated, no?\n\nAlso the little sister didn\u2019t just say Hi, she took photos of OP while eating, called her unnie without asking, asked about if OP liked kpop, etc. Sure, in isolation one of those things wouldn\u2019t be that weird, but in combination, OP put up with it all. The only way OP might have messed up is by not telling the little sister herself to stop, but since the bf wasn\u2019t very receptive, maybe she sensed none of the family would be and it wouldn\u2019t go over well", "If all she did was say hello in Korean, then yeah, OP would be TA. But that's not what happened here. She racially stereotyped OP, took pictures of her without her consent *even when OP was just trying to eat*, and treated her like an animal at a zoo. It was dehumanizing and inappropriate, even if that wasn't the intent.\n\nOP pointed out her racism privately, and her boyfriend excused it. This 13 year old's behavior is clearly enabled by her family. Racism by way of ignorance is still racism, and her family doesn't seem interested in teaching her to be better.

Where's your sister?\"\n\nThis time, my Niece laughed and called my silly for not recognising her.\n\nI meant nothing by it, I don't care that her hair is short or long, yet there are definitely people that would've gotten offended and called me sexist / transphobic for saying that.\n\nAnd if they do, I am apparently at fault for not recognising someone and asking who they are, because they got offended at the implication that just because they had short hair, I assumed she wasn't my niece.\n\nDo you see why this isn't necessarily as simple as \"I am of X minority, I found Y offensive, therefore Y is offensive and you are Sexist/Racist/Homophobic/Transphobic\"?", "You finding something racist but it\u2019s not actually racist should not be fucking accepted, that\u2019s exactly what happened here.", "I always get asked if I like Haggis, it doesn't offend me but I see the irony seeing the same people mad about it being done to other races lol (I love haggis \ud83e\udd23)", "I shouldn't have to put the toilet seat down after I take a piss but I do it for basic common courtesy.

We happened to be listening to NPR and my mom told me never to say the word, and I wasn't paying attention, and my mom then had to educate me.\n\nEven as Korean adoptee, I was always so excited to meet other Koreans so I could learn more from where I was from.

Her usage of the word \"unnie\" is also both appropriate and actually preferred.\n\nIt's not a slur (others here have compared it to calling someone a nigga). It just means \"(older) sister\" and is used by girls/women to address older girls/women. If a boy/man wanted to address an older girl/woman, he would say \"Noona\" which also means \"(older) sister\" but only males say it. It is not only extremely common, it is also preferred as respect is ingrained into Korean culture.

Yeah.  But like...do you intend to be with your BF for a while?  If so, then a simple \"hey that word isn't really used politely\" or \"hey I'm not really into those bands\" isn't that hard.
