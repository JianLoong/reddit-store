You are charging for your materials, expertise AND time.  If materials are $15, that leaves you $45 for your time, which I'd guess is 3 to 4 hours.  At that rate, you are charging her just over minimum wage for a custom, rush order cake. You were offering her a good deal.", "NTA, \u201cYou can have it fast, you can have it good, you can have it cheap: pick two\u201d.", "INFO: So how much did you charge?", "NTA. You are in the right to charge more for a last minute order. Shame on her for trying to guilt you.", "NTA, but you should make it a general rule: urgent/last minute orders are charged more.", "NTA, this is her problem not yours. Any business that does things quicker than their usual would increase the price - see delivery costs as an example.", "NTA your friends that agree with how you handled it are right", "NTA.

She's the asshole for using her sister being sick to guilt trip you into giving her a discount. I despise people  like her.", "NTA.\n\nAll you did was add a \"rush fee\" to the normal cost. Think of it in terms of shipping when you order something online. You can get it in a week for free but if you want it tomorrow, it's going to cost you. This is a 5 P's problem for Kylie:\n\nProper Planning Prevents Poor Performance\n\nGiven her reaction though, I'd take the time to talk to any mutual friends about what happened just in case she decides to hurt your business by trying to paint you as greedy and insensitive. Oh, and save any messages. Always nice to have the receipts.", "NTA. Business is business and what you did was not wrong. She was super entitled expecting you to lower your price.  If she was that unhappy, she could have gone to another baker and tried her luck there. She would probably have been met with the same thing.\n\nShe didn't get what she wanted and is now sulking. Not your problem. You have lost nothing over this - she was not a firm friend and if she was she would not have expected anything less from you.", "NTA\n\nStill your time and talent.

It needs to be worth your while (particularly with no time to plan, which undoubtedly means cancelling other plans you might have had). You named your price, Kylie was well within her rights to reject it, but to get upset?\n\nShe can find a local bakery or grocery store or whatever and buy a pre-made cake for a price that works for her.
