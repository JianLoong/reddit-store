I work with catering firms, ordering food for large events (i.e. dinners or receptions for 200+ people) and if we tried to order food a few days beforehand, it would not be uncommon to pay an upcharge of several hundred dollars.  That is very common in the food industry.  \n\nNow I realize this party isn't anywhere near that in size, but people tend to discount the work that goes into baking and decorating a cake.  You might think she only buys a cake mix, beats it up, puts it in a pan and bake it. Most bakers do their own by scratch.  The ingredients/pans she needs for the designs may only be about $60 but most bakers add additional flavorings/ingredients to make the cake moister, taste better, more or less dense (depending on the design) and those ingredients they already have.  So tack on an additional say $20 for those ingredients. We are now at $80 invested.\n\nNext, the electricity to power the mixer and oven - let's be generous and say that's $5 for the whole thing.  We are now at $85.\n\nThe cake has to go on a cake board (plastic) or stiff cardboard and depending on the size, they run between $15 and $50.  Let's say she needs a medium sized one - we will go with $20 (cardboard - nothing fancy).  Now we are at $105.\n\nLabor up to this point is dependent upon how many \"cakes\" are being made to create the design.  Let's say OP has spent 3 hours mixing cakes, prepping pans, baking and cooling cakes @ $15/hour (minimum wage) so that's $45.  Add that to our total and we are at $150.\n\nOP mixes up frosting - using her decorator color pastes she already owns.  Each one is around $14.  Let's say the cake is 3 different colors plus white.  That is $42 so now we are at $192.\n\nDepending on the design, frosting a cake can take several hours - depending on the intricacy of the design, whether setting time needs to be factored in (where frosting sets before the next layer goes on, so the colors don't run together).  Let's assume it's not a terrible intricate design with a lot of setting time.  Let's say 5 hours at $15/hour. That $75 for her labor here and we are now at $267 so far.\n\nNext - the cake has to be transported.  How far?  And with the cost of gas (my local station was $3.69/gallon this morning) - it could easily cost around $15 to go round trip depending on the distance.  Also, depending on the size of the cake, OP might have to borrow/rent a larger vehicle to deliver it.  That's another cost.  So $267 without factoring in gas, possible vehicle rental, maybe parking fees  ... $290 isn't so farfetched.  \n\nFar too many people expect artisans to give them a great price on something hand made, without realizing the personal costs of the artisan who makes the item.  So everyone remember that when you are balking at paying your friend to knit you that hat or crochet that blanket for you and give you the \"friend\" discount - asking to only pay them for the \"supplies\" and ignoring payment for their time and talent is ridiculous!  If you don't want to pay for that, then go buy it at Walmart!", "So I guess I was expecting to maybe see the price double from $60 to $120 at the most, because of the time involved at the last minute. I agree that $290 is hella expensive, and I\u2019d bake my own cake before I\u2019d pay that.\n\nHowever, do we know what kind of cake Kylie is asking for? If it\u2019s large, elaborate, a specialty flavor, decorated in a manner that requires tools OP would have to purchase, or otherwise something that a CakeWars contestant might produce, OP might be legitimately trying to recoup their materials costs plus the time involved.

That means sourcing the ingredients, baking, cooking and decorating.  Typically bakers can spread it out over multiple days.  My friend makes specialty cakes and her icing took 2 hours to make.  Then she had to make two or three batches because of the size and the amount of colors she needed for the cake.  For a side gig she would not have batch icing on hand.  She would more than likely be working every moment of that two days to get a specialty cake done on time.  We also don't know the design.

Idk what rush charging should be for a cake, maybe it's 2x maybe it's 5x, hell, maybe it's 8x and you were undercharging her.

Many bakers would agree. I disagree with your notion, what would you charge or what is reasonable to you? What do you think goes into a side BUSINESS and do you bake what if this takes away from her other orders because it's rushed.

So when exactly is she meant to to find the time to bake and decorate this cake? Overnight, perhaps, whilst you're sleeping?\n\nThen once your sponger mate has her sponge in her hand, then the baker has to go back and work some more hours to catch up on the work that she set aside to rush this cake through.\n\nBut don't fret, there's a silver lining in here! \n\nThis is a free market, so if you want something for nothing then I suggest that you take your cake request and go find the nearest meth head to make you one for five bucks, because you don't have to pointlessly whinge online over your astonishing entitlement, you can take your money elsewhere.\n\nThe baker is most definitely NTA, but you are.", "You realize that it takes about 10-15 hours or more to make a decorated cake, right?

It's not like this is a life threatening situation.\n\nOP is not a professional baker, but she has a valuable skill, a spontaneous order means she might have to drop her plans so for that reason I don't think it is unreasonable. Even if her plans were as simple as I am going to relax and watch netflix all evening. The question she should be asking is \"for what price am I willing to drop my plans\".\n\n  \nA professional bakery will be baking cakes anyway, they can usually shuffle their schedule around a bit to somehow squeeze in another cake or pay some employee overtime. Not to mention having firm express charges makes it easier for customers to know what to expect.\n\n  \nNow based on OPs comments it seems she charged based on how much she estimated this person was able / willing to pay, which you can think what you want of but that is also pretty standard in many service industries.
