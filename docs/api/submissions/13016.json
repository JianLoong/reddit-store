It's not just about whether what you said is what you believe or not. It's inappropriate to liken 2 situations with such a vast difference in severity. For an example... My apartment manager has begun locking the laundry rooms at 9pm. She's being overly controlling and she's in a position of power. It's not the only things she's done like this.

You've gone through some tough stuff -- so sorry about the loss of your brother -- and have been getting help to process everything in the new normal you've been thrust into. \n\nAnd while you're doing the work to find a new pathway, realize that your wife and the rest of your family need to navigate new territory, too. They've not made the same choices you have and the person they knew -- the person your wife married -- has now changed in ways that are fundamentally different than what they are used to. Indeed, if faith is a cornerstone of how they perceive themselves and the world, then your shift away from it can be very, very disturbing and disrupting, causing them to face questions they'd rather not focus on. \n\nSo your wife's reaction seems extreme and unfair, but from her perspective, your new reality is exactly that. The person she married has changed dramatically. It's not wrong or right, it just is. And that's hard for her to process and accept. \n\nYou said you've gotten counseling to help you through your changes and it sounds like you're gaining some great tools for coping with situations like the one you described. Perhaps it's time to include your wife in some counseling so the two of you can find a \"new normal\" in your relationship.

I'm 70 and became an atheist in my early 20s just as the Moral Majority organized in an effort to immutably alter the morals for all religions in the USA. What you're seeing now is the result of 50 years of demonizing atheists. I got fired for being atheist, not being the right political party and being a 30-year-old female without a marriage or children. Talk about a hostile environment. You're going to be facing the same or worse today and you sure don't need it from your wife. \n\nMy spouse of 40 years was atheist but elected to keep it quiet. He was sure he'd lose his job and his family. I kept quiet about him but I was open. The family finally quit trying to get him to divorce me after 30 years. I already lost everything to religion and I won't be going back. Problem was, Spouse found out that Co-workers were evaluating his performance in teams as \"the guy with the atheist wife.\" I  stopped socializing with his office folk so he could live his lie. \n\nIt wasn't until we moved to a very Catholic state and he quit corporate jobs that he felt safe. It was like a relief and an explosion. There were several times that words fell out of his mouth that left **me**  stunned, much less the guests. Anger. All those years of pretending. \n\nYou handled the discussion well. If you're doing \"why lie\" you do that. I  don't know if you were subconsciously offering up your wife's religious compliance as a way to make as a couple less onerous. I , personally, don't think it's your business to talk about your wife's religion unless expressly agreed upon. \n\nIt would be bad to your marriage if your wife expects you to live a lie. If you agree to backtrack and pretend that it's fine that the kids go to Catholic school (there may be a sudden family priority to get kids in one) then this all has to be discussed beforehand.

My parents have been married 30 years. My mother lost her faith as a teenager, for many reasons. For years, my dad held out hope that my mom would come back to the Church and she held out hope he would leave. \n\nTo be honest with you, it was a huge source of strain on their relationship - second only to their limited finances - and on dad\u2019s relationship with his family (my mother\u2019s parents are also Catholic but had long since learned to shut up about it with her). You will need to be very intentional about how you handle the topic with your kids. \n\nOver time, my dad has become less religious. He still goes to Mass weekly because he is paid to play the music there, but he no longer takes Communion and has become markedly more liberal in his beliefs as well (he was always a middle of the road Kennedy Democrat, but he voted for Warren in the 2020 primary). All four of us kids are agnostic/atheist. I didn\u2019t marry in the Church - my siblings likely won\u2019t either - and he never said a word about it. \n\nI say all this because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily an AH here, though I think the way she spoke to you was a bit unreasonable. Faith differences are *hard* on a marriage, especially one that didn\u2019t start off that way. She\u2019s probably afraid she\u2019s losing you, since you\u2019ve changed so much. She may also be afraid of losing her support network and she may genuinely fear for your soul. \n\nIt\u2019s possible she may come around in time, either to become less religious herself (as my dad did) or to simply accept the differences, but I think you need couples counseling to get there. It sure would\u2019ve helped my parents if they\u2019d had it - maybe it wouldn\u2019t have taken 20-some years to resolve - and made the house a less stressful place to grow up.\n\nNAH, though I think you need a conversation about the way she spoke to you as well as an ongoing conversation about the deeper issues this brings up.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife and you will not work out in the long run.

You seem OK with her being a believer, so fine.\n\nSo, nothing needs fixing except between you guys.
