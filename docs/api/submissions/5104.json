He's the first person I came out to as a lesbian (relevant later), and the first person I called and cried my soul out when my family didn't accept me. \n\nWhen I came out, and started dating girls, we had one more thing in common to talk about. When we had one of these chats he mentioned how it must be nice getting flowers, being asked and taken out on a date. How he'd like to be the one being asked out for once, but he's a guy and he's expected to be more dominant and take the first step, he's scared of the judgement he'd possibly get if he asked. After he told me this, I saved some money, got him flowers, and some chocolates, asked and took him out on a date. This started a tradition in a way, where I'd occasionally do this kind of cheesy stuff for him.  I have a gf of one year now, she knows about this, she thinks it's funny and sweet and sometimes even joins, so 2 lesbians take out a straight guy on a date. My friend got into a relationship a couple of months ago. At first, his girlfriend didn't seem to mind, and said she was fine with this. Last week she called him while we were out saying it was an emergency, but I later found out she called him because she was uncomfortable with us being that close and that our friendship and that tradition are weird. \n\nShe called me couple of days later too asking to talk. At first, she told me she was uncomfortable with me taking her bf out for dates, and I was fine with that. And it all would've been fine if she didn't add that the thing that makes her uncomfortable is me 'treating him like a woman'. How a guy should be the one asking a girl out, getting her flowers, and doing cheesy stuff, not the opposite. Like a cherry on top, she said I might turn him gay. \n\nI told her that's not how it works, that her way of thinking is harmful, and if this is the reason she's uncomfortable, I won't stop because this is something that makes him happy. She called me a bitch and left.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks I shouldn't bother and just let it go for now. Also, I wanna add that this is not something common. We're all in college and we have jobs, so because of our busy lives those 'dates' became once or twice a month thing, and it's just an 'excuse' in a way, to catch up.\n\nEdit: I came back here to clarify some things, but after getting a call from said friend, I guess those don't matter anymore. When he called me, I was still thinking if I should tell him or not, because as some of you said, I shouldn't get in between. He went first, and long story short, what actually bothered her is the fact I'm gay and that her boyfriend is still friends with me even after knowing that. Also the fact that she genuinely believes men can't be feminine if they're straight. They broke up. So I'll continue to spoil my straight guy best friend. \n\nI just wanna add that I live in mostly conservative, patriarchal and homophobic country. For those who don't believe a person can say something like his now ex girlfriend said.

It communicates that she would likely neglect that side of your friend. You're a good friend.", "NTA. She\u2019s all hung up on toxic masc gender roles that are going to get her in gross relationship dynamics\u2026 best of luck to her.

Yaa it would be different if she knew about your sexuality but is still uncomfortable with it. But in case she doesn't then as his GF she has the right to be uncomfortable about it. Because if it is from the GF perspective then you would be the Female best friend of her partner who is always trying to seduce him. I know you may not have any kind of intentions of seducing him but it is because we the readers here know that you are lesbian but it will be different for her. I know the way she approached the topic was rude but her being uncomfortable with it is reasonable. \nI also had a friend of the opposite gender who I would text late night every day because we both go to bed late but this changed when my friend had a partner. Yaa I still text and talk with my friend but I stopped texting late nights after asking the SO whether they were comfortable or not with it.\nSo if she says she is uncomfortable try to respect her boundaries within a reasonable limit but you don't need to completely become distant with your friend.", "This is a bit confusing. They have been together two months, and y\u2019all have a date every two months. And yet you said that initially the girlfriend was ok and then she wasn\u2019t anymore? The stuff about \u201cturning him gay\u201d or \u201ctreating him like a woman\u201d is so absurd I even doubt she actually said it. Let\u2019s be real, you are in the wrong because you should respect other people\u2019s boundaries, but then you are in the right because she randomly said homophobic stuff? \n\nWhen people get into relationships they build their own dynamic with their own boundaries. I understand you may be jealous of your best friend, but it\u2019s your turn to step back and let him enjoy being in love. Your dates are cute and it\u2019s normal for you to not want to let go, but it\u2019s his chance to be happy. It doesn\u2019t mean y\u2019all can\u2019t be friends anymore, just that his girlfriend is entitled to set the boundaries that make her comfortable.", "She knew I am gay from the start, she even met my girlfriend.

He has a girlfriend but you take him on dates - not just a hang out but flowers etc a couple of times a month? Wtf is that about.

Also it reads like the \u201cdates\u201d are just them catching up and more importantly she was okay with stopping the flowers/dates cuz it made the gf uncomfortable at first. She\u2019s only continuing because the gf was an ass and made a homophobic comment of \u201cturning him gay\u201d.

Usually don\u2019t get pushback but this guy said no until the 4th date. while leaving the restaurant I told him \u201cyou\u2019ve planned all our dates so far and paid. I\u2019m planning the next one\u201d he kinda laughed and said cool. The next day I asked him if he was free Thursday and he said yes and I told him I\u2019d come by and pick him up and to dress nicely. He changed the subject (in hindsight I should\u2019ve realized there was an issue) Thursday comes around and I check in that morning about the date and he\u2019s like uhh we\u2019ll see that was the last thing I heard from him. He reached out 5months later. When he did reach out he said he thought it was weird that I was so insistent on planning a date and I was trying to diminish his masculinity. I told him I would\u2019ve been fine if he wanted to drive (I know that\u2019s not what he meant) and explained that I was raised to treat people how I wanted to be treated and I figure since I liked when people planned something they thought I would enjoy others probably feel the same. Even men because it\u2019s feels nice to be thought of. He didn\u2019t agree but did ask what I had planned. I said it was a date to a speakeasy since he like to have drinks and cigars and mentioned that he loved the environment of them. He countered saying he had been to most in our city and that doesn\u2019t make any sense for me to plan as I don\u2019t drink or smoke. I told him thats true I don\u2019t but I liked him and so I can handle a night there every once in a while. He asked which speakeasy my answer upset him- it was an invite only place that he\u2019d mentioned in passing about wanting to visit. Never thought it would be a useful contact but I use to babysit one of the owners kids. He then backpedaled to apologizing saying it\u2019s been instilled in him to be like this and I could help him change. I declined to help both with him changing and him getting the invite.", "NTA\n\nMy husband and I were friends with a lesbian couple. One of the women shared very similar interests to my husband. They caught movies together (horror) and did some other activists I had zero interest in. It worked well and I loved my time to myself.

So even if you do stop taking him on dates she will likely try to gradually remove you (and your sweet gf) out of his life just for being qeer. \n\nI would suggest for you to have a talk with your friend and let him know what his gf said. Because if he specifically likes being asked out on a date once in a while (which is very sweet and reasonable in my oppinion) and his gf specifically thins that it's imasculating and will turn him gay so she won't do it, then they need to figure this out in some way.", "GF accusing OP of treating her BF like  woman is some toxic BS on top of everything else.", "She's also nuts if she thinks that flowers and candy and attention will make him gay.

It uses fake leather instead of real leather, it doesn't use the silent goretex stuff, no side vents, liner mesh is much worse, cuffs are a much worse design, etc etc. The real version had none of those issues, and was perfect in every manner. Good material, good construction, durable to anything short of a bear, laid out with thought, and was absolutely beautiful. Too beautiful for this world apparently.\n\nNaturally I tackled the bear cub and tried to retrieve the jacket. The bear thought it was a fun game of keep-away. So imagine having a bear in a headlock, trying to retrieve a jacket from his maul, while another bear is attacking your shoe laces, etc etc. Fighting two bears at once was too much and sadly the jacket did not survive the incident.\n\nI had plenty of names for the bear but they're probably not kosher on reddit.\n\nI'm still looking for a replacement jacket, and probably always will.", "Who says she isn't speaking to him about it?
