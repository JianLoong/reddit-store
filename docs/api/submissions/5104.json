When we had one of these chats he mentioned how it must be nice getting flowers, being asked and taken out on a date. How he'd like to be the one being asked out for once, but he's a guy and he's expected to be more dominant and take the first step, he's scared of the judgement he'd possibly get if he asked. After he told me this, I saved some money, got him flowers, and some chocolates, asked and took him out on a date. This started a tradition in a way, where I'd occasionally do this kind of cheesy stuff for him.  I have a gf of one year now, she knows about this, she thinks it's funny and sweet and sometimes even joins, so 2 lesbians take out a straight guy on a date. My friend got into a relationship a couple of months ago. At first, his girlfriend didn't seem to mind, and said she was fine with this.

She called me a bitch and left.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks I shouldn't bother and just let it go for now. Also, I wanna add that this is not something common.

When people get busy lives it is important to invest in such routines to ensure you don't lose contact with each other.", "NTA, she\u2019s insecure af if she can\u2019t get over the fact that her boyfriends clearly platonic, openly gay and TAKEN friend is just treating him nicely. Fucks sake lol.\n\nAlso, you might make him gay for spoiling him with food and drinks as a friend? LOL. Yeah true, he\u2019s better off fighting wolves with his bare hands in the Alaskan wilderness. That\u2019ll make sure he never reconsiders his sexuality, no flowers or dinner for him.", "NTA. This is insanely sweet. \n\nAnd now I realise I've to start putting more effort into my friendships, I've let a few slide over the years...", "NTA, perhaps she is upset because you\u2019ve, unintentionally, pointed out what she is slacking on in the relationship.

You seem like an absolutely wonderful friend. :)", "NTA, you've not done anything wrong necessarily and his GF is clearly out of line judging him for the thing he was worried he would be judged about, but I agree with your girlfriend that you should let it go. If he wants to break up with her over it that's his choice, and you definitely don't want to put yourself in between him and his GF. I think the \"dates\" are a lovely thing for you to do for your friend and a great way to make time to spend together, but you shouldn't do it out of spite to his partner just because she was rude to you.", "NTA She knows exactly why there's those dates and rather then do what her bf would like ( so you wouldn't need to ) she juges him on that and spout illogical homophobic non sense...\nThat's one of the few cases that is actually toxic feminity.", "This is hilarious.

Not only due to the reasons you mentioned, but especially considering your friend confided he was scared of judgement if he ever asked to be treated to a date in the way you now do. It communicates that she would likely neglect that side of your friend. You're a good friend.", "NTA. She\u2019s all hung up on toxic masc gender roles that are going to get her in gross relationship dynamics\u2026 best of luck to her. With his current partner, your friend most definitely will suffer for not \u2018manning up\u2019 enough and doing something yucky like having friends or even *gasp* emotions! So keep showing the love \u2764\ufe0f And hopefully your friend moves on from her and continues to enjoy his sweet dates with his lovely mates for a long time yet.", "NTA. He is so lucky to have you as a friend and hopefully his gf takes some time to consider why she is so upset and grows as a person or failing that he dumps her for her toxic values.", "Well I will go with NTA\nBut the important thing here is whether your friend's GF knows that you are a lesbian? \nWell I agree with the statement that only men have to be the one to do everything in a relationship is wrong ( the GF views on a relationship might be wrong) but no one will be comfortable with their SO receiving flowers by the opposite gender. Yaa it would be different if she knew about your sexuality but is still uncomfortable with it. But in case she doesn't then as his GF she has the right to be uncomfortable about it. Because if it is from the GF perspective then you would be the Female best friend of her partner who is always trying to seduce him. I know you may not have any kind of intentions of seducing him but it is because we the readers here know that you are lesbian but it will be different for her. I know the way she approached the topic was rude but her being uncomfortable with it is reasonable. \nI also had a friend of the opposite gender who I would text late night every day because we both go to bed late but this changed when my friend had a partner. Yaa I still text and talk with my friend but I stopped texting late nights after asking the SO whether they were comfortable or not with it.\nSo if she says she is uncomfortable try to respect her boundaries within a reasonable limit but you don't need to completely become distant with your friend.", "This is a bit confusing. They have been together two months, and y\u2019all have a date every two months. And yet you said that initially the girlfriend was ok and then she wasn\u2019t anymore? The stuff about \u201cturning him gay\u201d or \u201ctreating him like a woman\u201d is so absurd I even doubt she actually said it. Let\u2019s be real, you are in the wrong because you should respect other people\u2019s boundaries, but then you are in the right because she randomly said homophobic stuff? \n\nWhen people get into relationships they build their own dynamic with their own boundaries. I understand you may be jealous of your best friend, but it\u2019s your turn to step back and let him enjoy being in love. Your dates are cute and it\u2019s normal for you to not want to let go, but it\u2019s his chance to be happy. It doesn\u2019t mean y\u2019all can\u2019t be friends anymore, just that his girlfriend is entitled to set the boundaries that make her comfortable.", "She knew I am gay from the start, she even met my girlfriend. If she didn't that would be different story, as you said.", "Idk where u got the two months thing honestly, literally nowhere in the post is said that they've been together only 2 months.", "\u201cMy friend got into a relationship a couple months ago\u201d", "NTA. His girlfriend is insecure and homophobic. You should tell him she said you \u2018might turn him gay\u2019 because that\u2019s such toxic masculinity perpetuated by her.", "NTA. I HAVE LITERALLY DONE THE SAME. Its AWESOME. I got single straight female friend flowers and sweets she was so happy. I have also gotten my male straight friend chocolates and said I love you as family when he went NC with family. I have also gotten valentines day gift and flowers delivered at work to my lesbian friend who was sad being single on valentine's. It's totally fun spoiling Ur friends.", "YTA. & him. He has a girlfriend but you take him on dates - not just a hang out but flowers etc a couple of times a month? Wtf is that about. He needs to find the courage to be true to himself & pick women who meet his needs instead of getting with people & involving them in this mess. Bet the folks sating N T A would feel very different if their fella was being romanced by a gay guy.", "Bro u literally just said ur the asshole cuz I think u lied??? You: \u201cNo that\u2019s not what happened hence ur the asshole\u201d\n\nWhat are you on? Also miss the part where she was fine backing off if the gf was uncomfy because of the \u201cdating\u201d aspect? If u don\u2019t think it\u2019s a believable story that\u2019s fine but u can\u2019t say she\u2019s an asshole cuz of ur own opinion.", "No it\u2019s a gay girl so she will obviously have no feelings for him and she is also taken. Also it reads like the \u201cdates\u201d are just them catching up and more importantly she was okay with stopping the flowers/dates cuz it made the gf uncomfortable at first. She\u2019s only continuing because the gf was an ass and made a homophobic comment of \u201cturning him gay\u201d. Therefore since she\u2019s not uncomfortable with the dates just with her boyfriend being feminine, I see no reason to stop the \u201cdates\u201d. I think you\u2019ve misread.", "\n>\u201dI (20f) have been best friends with (20m) since elementary school.

I don\u2019t think anyone was in the wrong before these were set, but in a relationship any partner should feel free to voice what makes them uncomfortable. Is not for the friends to decide whether it is acceptable or not, the boyfriend should make his own evaluation. Also, we are all saying our opinion? Isn\u2019t it the whole point of the sub? You weren\u2019t there either I assume", "Ofc they can voice what makes them feel uncomfortable but she is being bigoted due to the fact that she doesn\u2019t like how her boyfriend is being treated femininely. She is not uncomfortable because of the dates so why would op stop the dates? If this was a different scenario but same idea such as:\n\n\u201cThe gf comes up to the bf\u2019s friend and says I don\u2019t like the fact my bf is allowed to wear dresses at your house because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s manly enough. I would like it if you stopped creating that safe space.\u201d\n\nWhat is your response now?", "Also I meant it was weird for u to make an opinion on whether she\u2019s an asshole after saying that the post is just false? You literally change the story so she\u2019s the asshole and then give ur verdict.", "My response is telling the boy and making him know I would support him. He is an adult for God\u2019s sake. As I said, it\u2019s for him to evaluate the situation.", "Lmao she is not an ASSHOLE she just need to respect other people\u2019s boundaries. She should either way. The supposed homophobia of the girl is for her boyfriend to deal with either way, since it\u2019s directed towards HIM.", "I agree the boyfriend will need to give an evaluation but what we are arguing here is if the friend is in the wrong for saying the gf\u2019s uncomfortableness is not her problem. I agree with op u do not.", "Yes but I think that OP has no decision to make. It\u2019s for the boy to decide. I mean, she can\u2019t go on dates with him if he doesn\u2019t want to. \nIt\u2019s not her problem, well said! It\u2019s the boyfriends problem.", "Holy shit absolutely NTA.  You're doing something sweet for your friend (that's clearly not actually in a romantic way); she's clearly very insecure as a person to be worried about you spending time with him. But omg for her to say you might \"turn him gay\"??? That's absolutely barbaric.\n\nHonestly, he needs to dump her. There are tons of women out there that are happy to treat their guy the way he wants to be treated, and she clearly isn't going to. It breaks my heart that he's scared to ask for that kind of stuff.", "I feel bad for your friend. You kind of seem like the only one who really wants him to get affection. His girlfriend obviously doesn't see him as someone who deserves to get treated to things. \n\nNTA.", "I N F O - has he had other girlfriends that were okay with this in the time that you started doing this?\n\nI seriously don't get this sub sometimes.\n\nLooks like this will be unpopular but I'm leaning towards YTA. Even if you're not into him, it's a pretty reasonable boundary - nothing to do with \"jealousy\".\n\nFrom your description it sounds like what brought this whole tradition on to begin with was the fact that he was single and the purpose of this was supposed to \"emulate\" a certain dating experience for it.\n\nNow that he's in a relationship, that purpose is kind of redundant, and frankly, disrespectful.\n\nHanging out with him is one thing, nothing wrong with that. But this whole cutesy \"date role playing\" is kind of weird now that he's in a relationship and basically giving his girlfriend a middle finger. Even if it doesn't actually threaten the relationship.", "NTA you're being a very good friend and it's pretty obvious his gf is not a good match for him.\n\nAnd honestly, if she wants to set this boundary, she needs to talk to her bf about it rather than you. If she wants him to stop going on these dates, he's the one she should be asking to stop, not you.\n\nBut we all know exactly why she's trying to go through you for this: asking him would lead to a fight and a strained relationship.", "NTA but i can tell u right now some of his future gfs may have the same thoughts about you both that his current gf has.", "NTA, you know I read a quote that goes well with your post \u201cfor 88% of man, the first time they get flowers is at their funeral\u201d, probably wrong but there is a part of truth in it.", "NTA-- but that said, as long as he's in this relationship, let it go. Tell him what his partner has asked you, let him know you still are happy to hang out without this whole \"date\" pretense, and then let him decide whether he's okay with this relationship knowing this about his partner. And don't ask him on another date until this relationship is over.", "NTA - He voiced that he needs/wants this kind of treatment, and you responded with generosity and silliness and love. What a gift you are to each other! These are the friendships that will outlast flimsy BF/GF BS relationships. Hang on to each other!", "NTA and you should tell your friend about this. He deserves to know who he's dating", "Yup, in my mind two gorgeus lesbian amazones are guarding this guy from toxic masculinity! No nobler cause can be found in 2022! \n\nHe needs a new girlfriend with a healthier mindset, honestly. He sounds like he's sick of the stereotypical male image so it might be time to introduce him to some feminists who'd love a nurturing and caring partner for her and any kids if they want them. He sounds like a dream to me, honestly. NTA, wine and dine that dude until his mindset is cemented and healthy!", "Shit, I have wrestled a bear with my bare hands and I'd like to get flowers, chocolate and asked out on a date.\n\n(Sadly only petted wolves, no wrestling with them.)", "Doesn't really sound like his gf will make him happy if she thinks men shouldn't receive any gifts and he seems to want to receive them. \n\nOP is ignoring her request to make sure her friend is still happy and that's a reasonable thing to do. If it also helps him realize that his gf is pretty shitty then all the more reason to do so.\n\nEdit: Also, this seems like a boundary the gf should set with the friend rather than the OP. But we all know she isn't doing it that way because he wouldn't want to and it would cause problems in the relationship.", "Frankly it doesn't matter. It's still really weird to go on dates with someone that isn't your SO.\n\nThat they are specifically going the extra mile to make it romantic is even worse.", "Then OP should tell the boy and leave it up to him. Not her decision and certainly not yours. He decides if he\u2019s happy or not."]}
