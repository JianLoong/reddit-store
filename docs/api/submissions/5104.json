When we had one of these chats he mentioned how it must be nice getting flowers, being asked and taken out on a date. How he'd like to be the one being asked out for once, but he's a guy and he's expected to be more dominant and take the first step, he's scared of the judgement he'd possibly get if he asked. After he told me this, I saved some money, got him flowers, and some chocolates, asked and took him out on a date. This started a tradition in a way, where I'd occasionally do this kind of cheesy stuff for him.  I have a gf of one year now, she knows about this, she thinks it's funny and sweet and sometimes even joins, so 2 lesbians take out a straight guy on a date. My friend got into a relationship a couple of months ago. At first, his girlfriend didn't seem to mind, and said she was fine with this. Last week she called him while we were out saying it was an emergency, but I later found out she called him because she was uncomfortable with us being that close and that our friendship and that tradition are weird. \n\nShe called me couple of days later too asking to talk. At first, she told me she was uncomfortable with me taking her bf out for dates, and I was fine with that. And it all would've been fine if she didn't add that the thing that makes her uncomfortable is me 'treating him like a woman'. How a guy should be the one asking a girl out, getting her flowers, and doing cheesy stuff, not the opposite. Like a cherry on top, she said I might turn him gay. \n\nI told her that's not how it works, that her way of thinking is harmful, and if this is the reason she's uncomfortable, I won't stop because this is something that makes him happy. She called me a bitch and left.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks I shouldn't bother and just let it go for now. Also, I wanna add that this is not something common.

What you do is very sweet. His GF is insecure and jealous. \n\nIf I were you I would talk to your friend about the situation and the two of you together decide in the way forward. \n\nI am middle aged and I regularly go on dates with my friends (male and female). When people get busy lives it is important to invest in such routines to ensure you don't lose contact with each other.", "NTA, she\u2019s insecure af if she can\u2019t get over the fact that her boyfriends clearly platonic, openly gay and TAKEN friend is just treating him nicely. Fucks sake lol.\n\nAlso, you might make him gay for spoiling him with food and drinks as a friend? LOL. Yeah true, he\u2019s better off fighting wolves with his bare hands in the Alaskan wilderness. That\u2019ll make sure he never reconsiders his sexuality, no flowers or dinner for him.", "NTA. This is insanely sweet. \n\nAnd now I realise I've to start putting more effort into my friendships, I've let a few slide over the years...", "NTA, perhaps she is upset because you\u2019ve, unintentionally, pointed out what she is slacking on in the relationship. If she treated him special every so often he wouldn\u2019t be needing it from you, which is so sweet.", "Two of my closest friends are a lesbian couple (I actually set them up, friends with one of them since we were literally in preschool, the other for the last 6-7 years after meeting at a bar while both having a decompression drink after work by ourselves and hit it off since we were two of very few in the bar) and have broken things off with a woman I was seeing when she started to get fussy about us spending time together in a very similar way (we even call them dates).\n\nI'm not saying that's what your bestie should do (and granted I'm over a decade older than you folks, so maybe I have a bit less patience when it comes to these things), but if I were him I'd be taking a hard look at my relationship.  That sort of insecurity is petty and just...  ugly.  I was especially taken aback at the \"turning him gay\" part.  That would be a quick and easy deal breaker for me.\n\nHard NTA, OP.  The whole thing, sans insecure girlfriend, had me grinning while reading.  Incredibly wholesome and heartwarming.  You seem like an absolutely wonderful friend. :)", "NTA, you've not done anything wrong necessarily and his GF is clearly out of line judging him for the thing he was worried he would be judged about, but I agree with your girlfriend that you should let it go. If he wants to break up with her over it that's his choice, and you definitely don't want to put yourself in between him and his GF. I think the \"dates\" are a lovely thing for you to do for your friend and a great way to make time to spend together, but you shouldn't do it out of spite to his partner just because she was rude to you.", "NTA She knows exactly why there's those dates and rather then do what her bf would like ( so you wouldn't need to ) she juges him on that and spout illogical homophobic non sense...\nThat's one of the few cases that is actually toxic feminity.", "This is hilarious.

Not only due to the reasons you mentioned, but especially considering your friend confided he was scared of judgement if he ever asked to be treated to a date in the way you now do. It communicates that she would likely neglect that side of your friend. You're a good friend.", "NTA. She\u2019s all hung up on toxic masc gender roles that are going to get her in gross relationship dynamics\u2026 best of luck to her. With his current partner, your friend most definitely will suffer for not \u2018manning up\u2019 enough and doing something yucky like having friends or even *gasp* emotions! So keep showing the love \u2764\ufe0f And hopefully your friend moves on from her and continues to enjoy his sweet dates with his lovely mates for a long time yet.", "NTA. He is so lucky to have you as a friend and hopefully his gf takes some time to consider why she is so upset and grows as a person or failing that he dumps her for her toxic values.", "Well I will go with NTA\nBut the important thing here is whether your friend's GF knows that you are a lesbian? \nWell I agree with the statement that only men have to be the one to do everything in a relationship is wrong ( the GF views on a relationship might be wrong) but no one will be comfortable with their SO receiving flowers by the opposite gender. Yaa it would be different if she knew about your sexuality but is still uncomfortable with it. But in case she doesn't then as his GF she has the right to be uncomfortable about it. Because if it is from the GF perspective then you would be the Female best friend of her partner who is always trying to seduce him. I know you may not have any kind of intentions of seducing him but it is because we the readers here know that you are lesbian but it will be different for her. I know the way she approached the topic was rude but her being uncomfortable with it is reasonable. \nI also had a friend of the opposite gender who I would text late night every day because we both go to bed late but this changed when my friend had a partner. Yaa I still text and talk with my friend but I stopped texting late nights after asking the SO whether they were comfortable or not with it.\nSo if she says she is uncomfortable try to respect her boundaries within a reasonable limit but you don't need to completely become distant with your friend.", "This is a bit confusing. They have been together two months, and y\u2019all have a date every two months. And yet you said that initially the girlfriend was ok and then she wasn\u2019t anymore? The stuff about \u201cturning him gay\u201d or \u201ctreating him like a woman\u201d is so absurd I even doubt she actually said it. Let\u2019s be real, you are in the wrong because you should respect other people\u2019s boundaries, but then you are in the right because she randomly said homophobic stuff? \n\nWhen people get into relationships they build their own dynamic with their own boundaries. I understand you may be jealous of your best friend, but it\u2019s your turn to step back and let him enjoy being in love. Your dates are cute and it\u2019s normal for you to not want to let go, but it\u2019s his chance to be happy. It doesn\u2019t mean y\u2019all can\u2019t be friends anymore, just that his girlfriend is entitled to set the boundaries that make her comfortable.", "She knew I am gay from the start, she even met my girlfriend. If she didn't that would be different story, as you said.", "Idk where u got the two months thing honestly, literally nowhere in the post is said that they've been together only 2 months.", "\u201cMy friend got into a relationship a couple months ago\u201d"]}
