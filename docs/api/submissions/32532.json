They were married, btw, it was just our mother was the parent who preferred to work and was overall more like the stereotype of a dad who works and doesn't really do much for his wife or kids. So you can imagine how hard it was when our dad died.\n\nWhen I was 9 my mother met Gavin and they got married the day after my 10th birthday. He was very ready to fill the role of a dad in my life but I was used to my sister and didn't really go to him for stuff. Instead I chose my sister. I also disliked him for trying because it felt like he was replacing my dad. He was very unsure of himself and didn't really have the best guidance in my mother on anything like that. But I did not want him to be my parent and I think even with better advice I would have resisted that. He tried though and I can admit that and say I don't think he had any bad intentions generally. I'm sure it was hard for him to want more but for me to never want to try back.\n\nMy sister and I both have a very low contact relationship with our mother as adults and I had planned on not inviting her to my wedding at all. But a family member suggested I should invite her for appearances sake and be ready for her to maybe not come. With inviting her though, Gavin is also invited and when he heard I asked my sister to walk me down the aisle he asked me about possibly doing it or having the father-daughter dance. I told him I would be saving that dance for my sister so we could honor dad. He told me he would still like to do one of those things and that I am the closest he ever got to having a kid and he tried his best and he feels like I could do that much for him. I told him I want my sister. That she and dad were the only two parents I ever knew.

I'm sorry your mom was such a bad parent.", "NTA at all. He is not your father. What he wants honestly doesn't matter. A relationship cannot be forced just because one person wants it.

I wouldn't have invited them at all. \n\nHonor your sister and have fun at your wedding.", "Nta", "NTA at all and what is up with some of these comments?  He is not your father, and never was. He chose to marry someone that he knew was neglecting her children. You don\u2019t owe him anything and it\u2019s ridiculous. He would even expect this when you don\u2019t have a relationship. Honestly, I would disinvite both of them because they don\u2019t even deserve to be at your wedding. Your mother was an extremely neglectful parent.

I have sympathy for anyone in these positions. But that still just doesn't give your stepdad the right to expect you to fulfill his wishes through your wedding.

Could be why Gavin feels like you and your sister are the only chances he ever got. \n\nHowever, YOU get to decide who walks you down the aisle or who you dance with for the father daughter dance. Because you have a clear vision of how you'd like you and your sister to honour your father, if there's any part of you that would like to include your stepdad, you could plan a second father daughter dance/song for the two of you.

Him marrying and staying with a woman who cared so little for her own children is a giant red flag to me. \n\nHe obviously was ok with it otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have married her the day after her daughter\u2019s 10th birthday. (So I\u2019m sure instead of a 10th bday party she was too busy with wedding stuff.) He had to have known her daughters were neglected before marriage, and obviously witnessed it while living together. OP describes him as her mother\u2019s husband not her stepfather. There\u2019s a reason for that. He may have felt he tried but obviously it didn\u2019t work out. Knowing that this man married and stayed with her mother even with the neglect would make me not trust him or think that he had genuine intentions. So of course OP kept him at arms length and turned to her sister like she always did before. \n\nHe is a plus one to pressured invite to the woman who gave birth to her. And he knows it and is still more concerned with saving face than OPs happiness. He doesn\u2019t want to be embarrassed or reminded of the neglect he married into. He chose to be with/stay with a woman neglecting her children and I\u2019m sure the rest of the family knows all about it. If he truly loved and cared for his \u201cstepdaughter\u201d he\u2019d be more concerned about her happiness and enjoying her big day guilt free.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules, your choices.", "OP didn't even invite Gavin.

You even say, you held his trying against him because it felt like he was trying to replace your Dad. This is a reasonable and even anticipated response from a child. But you are no longer a child, and I am sure you can see that he's just a person who was trying, maybe badly, but trying nonetheless. There is a big difference between someone who tries when their effort is not wanted, and a bad person. My impression is that your step-Dad is a decent person - he just wasn't ever going to replace your wonderful father and the fact he tried offended your emotions - it wasn't in the cards for him. You may grieve the father you lost, and he might be grieving the little girls he never had. It's not your responsibility to let him parent you, but it is your responsibility to be a kind and gracious person because we are all responsible to be that. \n\nThat doesn't mean you need to do anything at the wedding with him, but if I were you, I would write him something kind (again, if he has been kind and decent to you) and perhaps tell him that the fact that you never wanted that relationship with him is not a reflection of him being deficient, it is just a reflection of how the loss of your father impacted you, as well as your strained relationship with your mother, who was never really a parent to you. It might even be helpful to tell him he was mistaken (though he couldn't know it) in thinking he would be like a father to you by marrying your Mom, as you are not really emotionally connected to her as she was not present as a parent in your life as a child. Instead, your sister has been your emotional rock.\n\nI think a lot of Redditors will disagree with me - I see a lot of comments being angry he is making your wedding about him - but I am not sure that is what he is doing. I get the impression he is just a hurt man who is trying to express himself. I also think it is important that weddings are not just about the bride/groom - they are about family and community and they serve a social function. They also reflect a changing stage of life and personal growth. For these reasons, I think it is important to take any opportunity to be honest, kind, and have integrity. If there's an opportunity to both stick to your wishes, but also try to spare his feelings, that seems like the better course to me.", "When people say things like \u201cmaybe you should invite your ____ just for appearance sake\u201d, tell them to butt out.

Mom really let down a lot of people in a lot of ways here. I\u2019m glad OP and her sister were able to maintain a positive bond because a lot of siblings who have to take on parenting roles end up resentful and the sibling relationships sour. \n\nNAH.", "She is 10000% an AH. She never integrated herself into the household let alone anyone else. She was no parent.", "YTA for this comment alone. You literally  admit he tried and he was present. I get having a parent die young and I get the feeling of the step parent trying to \u201creplace\u201d your passed parent. BUT. You need therapy to work through these childhood issues you have. Because you are taking it out on him. You and the majority of reddit can think you\u2019re pretty princess angel but you\u2019re not. You are acting very bratty in the way you speak about him. You admit he tried. You admit he was there and present when your mother wasn\u2019t. So either retract the invitation or give the man something. An acknowledgment. ANYTHING.", "My sister wanted to keep doing it too. She was just as against Gavin taking over, maybe even more. We didn't trust him.", "I have decided to take the invitation back because I don't want my mother there.", "Right! if bio dad couldn't do that... is it readonable to expect that the stepdad could? How did they know he didn't try his best? And we know mom sucked, so who did all the stuff that sister could not do as a minor?"]}
