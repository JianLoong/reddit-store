Our mother was very absent after dad died. More absent. Dad was actually the stay at home parent for the two of us and he was the more involved parent in our lives. They were married, btw, it was just our mother was the parent who preferred to work and was overall more like the stereotype of a dad who works and doesn't really do much for his wife or kids. So you can imagine how hard it was when our dad died.\n\nWhen I was 9 my mother met Gavin and they got married the day after my 10th birthday. He was very ready to fill the role of a dad in my life but I was used to my sister and didn't really go to him for stuff. Instead I chose my sister. I also disliked him for trying because it felt like he was replacing my dad. He was very unsure of himself and didn't really have the best guidance in my mother on anything like that. But I did not want him to be my parent and I think even with better advice I would have resisted that. He tried though and I can admit that and say I don't think he had any bad intentions generally. I'm sure it was hard for him to want more but for me to never want to try back.\n\nMy sister and I both have a very low contact relationship with our mother as adults and I had planned on not inviting her to my wedding at all. But a family member suggested I should invite her for appearances sake and be ready for her to maybe not come. With inviting her though, Gavin is also invited and when he heard I asked my sister to walk me down the aisle he asked me about possibly doing it or having the father-daughter dance. I told him I would be saving that dance for my sister so we could honor dad. He told me he would still like to do one of those things and that I am the closest he ever got to having a kid and he tried his best and he feels like I could do that much for him. I told him I want my sister. That she and dad were the only two parents I ever knew. I acknowledged he tried but I said I never wanted him to be my parent.\n\nHe told me it was unfair to deny him this when I admit myself he tried.

I'm sorry your mom was such a bad parent.", "NTA at all. He is not your father. What he wants honestly doesn't matter. A relationship cannot be forced just because one person wants it.

I wouldn't have invited them at all. \n\nHonor your sister and have fun at your wedding.", "Nta", "NTA at all and what is up with some of these comments?  He is not your father, and never was. He chose to marry someone that he knew was neglecting her children. You don\u2019t owe him anything and it\u2019s ridiculous. He would even expect this when you don\u2019t have a relationship. Honestly, I would disinvite both of them because they don\u2019t even deserve to be at your wedding. Your mother was an extremely neglectful parent.

You\u2019re not the asshole for having your preference for your sister, but he\u2019s also not the asshole for feeling hurt when he tried as best he could.

In both cases, I was not angry at either of them and still valued their friendship, but I just didn't consider them friends to that level so many years after we'd spent significant time together. I don't blame either of them for being hurt and I'm sorry that they feel that way, but I wouldn't change my wedding to include them if I could go back and do it over again.
