You are never the AH for speaking up for yourself your friends are AH for forcing you to accept their decision and using guilt to drive that point. These aren\u2019t friends they dismissed your feelings and blamed you for having those feelings. Uninvite yourself and reevaluate the friends you have", "NTA  \nYou did inform them that you wouldn't feel comfortable with X around.  \nDespite that they chose to invite X.  \nYour backing out now totally acceptable.", "NTA-I\u2019d say loose the friends and do your own thing there. That\u2019s trash and it will only get worse what else would they do despite you saying no.", "INFO: How old are all you, and what did this 'flirting' entail?", "NTA, if I were in your place, I definitely would have canceled the trip and will not join them. Your friends are the A! These people are not your \"REAL\" friends. Real friends should not dismiss/invalidate your feelings. You should consider looking out for a new circle of friends.", "NTA. Your friends kinda are though in this. \n\nLet me tell you a story. I lived with a group of friends. One of these friends showed up one day after work, joined at the hip with the girl who tried to be my friend while simultaneously sleeping with my ex-fiance for months while I was at basic training (and continued after). The fallout was nuclear, and that's no understatement. He told me I should be over it, I asked if he was over his brother sleeping with his ex and he tried to tell me it was different. Needless to say, we weren't friends thereafter, because I couldn't stay friends with someone who could so easily disregard, disrespect, manipulate and gaslight me over something he was being a full hypocrite for. \n\nI can put money down now, if things were reversed on ANY ONE OF THEM they would be \"overreacting \" too. Keep standing up for yourself. And keep in mind; it's never too late to uninvite people unless you can't afford it without them or can't afford to lose anything non-refundable. If neither of those fits, uninvite them,  uninvite them to your hearts content.", "You friends din't hear you when you said you were uncomfortable with this other person.\n\nNot overreacting.  NTA\n\nCan you pull out of the trip?", "NTA. I feel your friends should've understood you better but given that they didn't, it is making me wonder what is up with the entire dynamic of your friends", "NTA. Perhaps I'm finally reaching middle-aged stage of being bitter, but here's my word of advice: reconsider that friendship. I know that when you're 19 all friendships seem to be important, and strong and for ever, but... They're not. In few years you'll be self-sufficient adult. Do you really want this kind of people around you when you'll be going through ordeals of your every day life? Will you be able to count on them in case of some emergency? If they want to sacrifice your comfort and happiness in the name of \"the vibe\", what else they're ready to dismiss? I'm not saying you should ditch them on spot, but simply ask yourself if you really need them in your life.", "NAH - going slightly against the grain here. Youre not an AH for having feelings but I dont think your friends need to be beholden to your standards. This is a person you dont like but your friends do\u2026 and they are allowed to be friends with and include who they want. You in turn can not be friends with them because of it.", "NAH, they have listened To your request but(probably as a group) decided to not uphold it, which is all good and fine", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your friend group did not intend to take your opinion into account they should not have asked. You have every right to be upset for being ignored.", "NTA\n\nPull out of the trip. Tell them the same thing they told you \u2014 that they\u2019ve \u201cruined the vibe.\u201d If they complain, say they shouldn\u2019t be so dramatic and immature and that they shouldn\u2019t put you in a difficult place. All the same crap they\u2019ve told you.\n\nYou won\u2019t enjoy the trip if the other person is there anyway. Most people don\u2019t get much time off and many don\u2019t have a lot of extra money to spend \u2014 so don\u2019t spend your time and money being uncomfortable just because your friends don\u2019t care about you like they should. You need better friends.", "NTA but your friends are. Maybe reconsider going, this may not be a good experience and if you cave now, you'll be stuck with him because they know you'll just accept it.", "F**K NO, you're not overreacting! They asked, you answered, and they disregarded you. I would avoid them the entire vacation and when we got back, I'd be explaining why I'm dropping their asses from my life and finding friends who respect me better. \n\nNTfknA", "NTA. They literally said no one should go that we are not comfortable with then immediately invited someone who you are uncomfortable with and called you immature for exercising the rule they made up.", "NTA\u2026drop out.  They made it clear that they care more about having the other person along than your feelings on the matter, so they should not be surprised.  Realize that this is not the friend group for you.  You have grown.  They have not.", "Thank you. They don't seem to understand that and one of my friends said if you behave like this people will think bad about you for ruining the vibe. I really am reconsidering everything", "Imagine dropping friendship because they won\u2019t do you everything you want...", "Thank you for your response. I told them that if everyone didn't need to be comfortable they should've not made it feel like my opinion would be valued to begin with. After arguing they apologised but now they want my help to continue organising the trip. I just feel used", "Thanks! I'll mostly be backing out soon", "That's my plan. I'll probably plan a trip with my best friend instead", "19. \nThis 'flirting' happened a while ago and my ex admitted to it (he was a trashbag that's why he's an ex) and once we broke up she tried to date him. I'm not comfortable with someone I can't trust. And since we aren't really in the same circle i don't feel like I need to mend fences but I could be wrong", "Thank you. I have been thinking of that too but it's probably the first time they've done this and idk if i should let it slide", "I'm glad that person is an ex and you set strict boundaries. I will try to do the same and back out soon", "I'm confused if I should tolerate it or not. These are people I've known and trusted for Years but they don't seem to care about my comfort. I'll think about it", "You're right. I think the only reason I'm upset is because when we started ( it was three of us) planning they made it very clear that all of us should be comfortable and we don't have to include anyone we are uncomfortable with.", "Maybe point out to them that the person who invited X ruined the vibe for you with their disrespect", "Imagine being such shitty friends that you still keep someone around that tried to intervene with someone's relationship who you claim to also be a friend of yours and then throwing s fit because \"you're gonna ruin the vibe\". Yeah no thanks, are you one of those shitty friends?", "Is the ex-friend still going? Even if they aren\u2019t really take the time to think about if going on a trip with these ppl will actually be enjoyable. The feelings you are having now won\u2019t magically go away do you really want to spend your vacation with those feelings and the ppl that made you feel this way?", "NTA.  \n\nWhat\u2019s your \u201cfriends\u201d relationship with this weirdo like? if they go way back I can understand them giving her the benefit of doubt but if they aren\u2019t even that close I\u2019d personally cancel the trip but I want you to weight how this could potentially back fire depending on how close y\u2019all are. It\u2019s personally unfathomable because my friends wouldn\u2019t dare because I\u2019d send everyone packing.", "It's rough to set boundaries and keep them,  especially when you think it's hurting someone else's feelings. But you shouldn't sacrifice your feelings for theirs, in the long run all it does is let people know they can walk on you (and sadly, they will). \n\nI know it sucks to feel like your choice will lose you the friends you have... but if they are so ready to disregard how you feel, it's so easy,  how close of friends are they? If you back out or uninvite people for this and REALLY drill in how much this hurt you, you'll learn which ones are really your friends because they will realize they were wrong and stay. The ones who leave? They weren't worth it. \n\nBest of luck to you!!!! I'm really keeping my fingers crossed <3\n\nEdit typo...I hate phones lol", "If you think you better off without them, it's time to start looking for better friends. However, the process of finding new friends might be a little overwhelming. I hope you get the nicest people to hang out with", "These just arent the friends you think they are maybe - or maybe your read on the flirting situation might be wrong and they dont see it as a big deal.", "I don't and my friends are trying to take back what they've done but it's not possible for me to forget it especially since one of them claimed my reaction was immature. I'll see how it turns out", "They do go way back. We all do. Same school etc. That's why i understand them giving the benefit of the doubt but i can't understand how they expect me to just magically be okay with them going behind my back and accept it.", "Thank you for your kindness. I have a few friends i trust completely and I'm thankful for them \n I hope you have a great day :)", "True. I think i need to cool off a bit and think about what i need to do", "Damn\u2026 Ok real world advice here. Your feelings are valid I don\u2019t think she respects boundaries, try to take what\u2019s necessary no valuables because I simply don\u2019t trust people who actively go for people that are taken BIG RED FLAG \ud83d\udea9it screams she\u2019ll pull a \u201cprank\u201d on you to lighten you up on the trip and you won\u2019t find it funny. Talk to them again and let them know your concerns with weirdo coming along and if any discrepancies occur along the trip you\u2019ll reconsider the friendship. We see people get traffic and unfortunately murdered by people the feel close with on vacations and those are the times you see peoples true colors (living together and going on trips together)", "It feels good to know I'm not overreacting because my friend made it seem like i was. I'll try to make it clear again but i think it's best for me to back out", "I\u2019d back out too. Nothing in this world is worth my peace of mind!"]}
