They fed this to Ella and she is suffering. Also, they never valued and listened to Trish and Andy; as if their needs were secondary to Ella's. \n\nThe parents crushed Ella's reality by feeding her lies for years.  Ella's heartache. It would have been far better for Ella to hear, \"Everyone is valued in this house. Trish and Andy are older and need time to  explore this new family.\" \n\nTelling your brother the truth is reality which will be difficult for him to accept given they worked so hard to sustaining a false reality.

Andy sucks about lying but Trish's kids are 18 and 17 - old enough to know the difference between being truthful and being unnecessarily cruel to a small child.", "NTA. Your Brother and SIL definitely are!", "It always was. They always acted as if Trish' kids were willing participants in all of this and had expectations of them as though they were adults who signed up to be parents vs kids at the time who were forced to be stepsiblings.", "They are old enough to know. But they have grown very resentful over the years."]}
