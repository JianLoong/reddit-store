The only assholes here are the parents. Look I'm not going to defend them for being cruel to the kid or what they said , or even pretend they were right, but those lies the parents  told will have created hate and resentment even when it didn't exist. \nForcing the new step sibling on them will have created resistance to them bonding with her, no one likes being pushed into things against their will.\nNo one likes being forced into relationships. \nConstantly pushing and lying will have cemented those feeling of unpleasantness. Those outbursts are a direct result of their actions. \nImagine having a stranger insisting you love them, fully buying into the fantasy when you really don't care about them and have done nothing to warrant them forcing their way closer. It'd make you dislike them, you'd  think they were stupid as well if you were deliberately showing them you didn't want them near, and eventually something is going to snap.  You are going to unload all those emotions probably at once and in not a good way, because once you start the flood gates are open.\nThe kid is going to feel hurt , rejected, humiliated, and unbelievably stupid for having thought they were  welcomed and  liked. They will now not trust their step siblings, and more importantly their parents because they consistently lied for years. They  had them  believing they were wanted, when in fact they were disliked. That is not going to be pleasant, and congratulations they are now going to have massive insecurities and trust issues wondering if they are really liked or just tolerated.\nEdit -given the ages this feels very much like a -You can't force me anymore, situation towards the parents. This is aimed at them. If you'd grown to hate and resent a situation then all of a sudden could see a way free if it , you might take it without caring about the fall out if you were far enough away from it.\n\nFrom their point of view it ends what they were forced into.

I can honestly see them 'behaving' and then telling the kid I'm only doing this because I was made to.\nI'm not saying they're right or that they weren't cruel -\nI'm saying they got what they wanted. Their parents can no longer push a relationship with the kid because after being verbally  eviscerted, by not  just one,  but both siblings -that kid is no longer going to approach them willingly for a long time. Knock on is they know they can get back at their parents for doing this by hurting the kid.

Yes this is an -old enough to know better situation, I don't  agree with what they did, but they're angry they can't force the teenagers to do what they want anymore , not considering they lied and made this happen.
