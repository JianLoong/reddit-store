He has a son (9) from his late wife. Todd is pretty close to his sister Monica. Their mom's deceased and Monica has basically taken over. She's nice to me and all but she seems to be a bit controlling especially when it comes to Todd. But that wasn't a real issue until after I got pregnant. After we found the gender of the baby (boy) she insisted on the name \"Tommy\" but I refused because I already had a name in mind and Todd loves it but he chose to stay out of the fight saying maybe we should just let Monica call him Tommy. I refused and asked her to please respect me and the fact that I'm the mom not her and she said okay.\n\n\nLike always, she's hosting christmas for the family this year and invited me and Todd to christmas dinner. I was intending on coming that is until I'd discovered that she hung stockings with her kids, nephews, neices names and hung a \"Tommy\" stocking saying that it's for my son. I was livid. I lost it on her and there was a huge fight. I told her I won't be coming to her christmas dinner if she doesn't remove the stocking or put the real name and then I left. Todd started yelling at me when we got home saying that I was attempting to ruin an important family tradition by refusing to come and said that I was overreacting and cannof be telling his sister what she should or shouldn't do in her own home. He tried to convince me to come but I said no. Not until she removes that stocking and it doesn't look like she's going to do it cause he spoke with her and he's now mad at me for \"making a huge deal out of it\". Her husband Philip who's usually nice to me called yesterday saying that he spoke with Todd and he'd be devastated if I cause \"the family\" to miss the event at Monica's house and ruin it not only for the adults but for the kids as well since my stepson loves spending the holidays with his cousins.\n\nTodd has been quiet and the only way we communicate is through Philip. I feel ashamed. Maybe I overreacted. AITA?\n\n\nEdit# to answer someone's question, no, I did not ask Monica to put a stocking for my son (she said it was for my son) It was her decision although I find it weird since the baby isn't even born yet.", "created_utc": 1702998143, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m3xgr/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_inlaws_christmas/", "score": 8821, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

Like her Dad, or a child she lost? Or did she just arbitrarily like that name better and started calling your son that?", "NTA\n\nI have to admit I'm kinda mean and if Todd attends doctor appointments with you I would tattle to the doctor about all the stress your husband and his sister are putting on you over labeling your son with a name that isn't the baby's.  I suggest you tell your husband you are done socializing with the in-laws until his sister starts therapy for her obsession. If she wants a child with that name she either needs to have another child or adopt.\n\nAs I said I am kinda mean, I would adopt a zoo animal. We got to name the one we adopted.  Call it Tommy.

If these problems do not resolve by Monica removing the sock and Todd apologising, DO NOT IGNORE THESE RED FLAGS PLEASE. I'm not saying you need to divorce him but at least couple's therapy is required and fast.\n\nThis story is similar to what happened between my brother and my mother. the son of my brother is called Mattia. However apparently when my brother was 17 years old he wanted to call his son ed to honour our grandfather called Edmond. this was during the grieving period and we both missed him (he was a great grandfather). \n\nMy mother then became convinced that my sister in law (my brother's wife). tricked my brother in the name Mattia. not to mention this was 8 years after mentioning it once! The name was my brother's and his wife's choice and he was very happy with that name. however the actions of my mother of calling Mattia Ed and putting \"Brothers name, Sister in law name, Ed\" on Christmas, vacation and bday cards caused a rift between them that I don't see to be repaired anytime soon.", "NTA.\n\n>she insisted on the name \"Tommy\" but I refused because I already had a name in mind and Todd loves it but he chose to stay out of the fight saying maybe we should just let Monica call him Tommy\n\nI just don't understand some people.

If you go and she decides to give you the stocking throw it out because she said I don't have anyone named Tommy. And your husband is a spineless jerk. He's staying out of it.

Please stand firm on this and do not feel ashamed.  I am ashamed of your husband for not sticking up for you.", "NTA. But I'm confused. Is your husband having the baby with you or Monica? I thought it was up to the parents to name their child. Did Monica help in the procreation of this baby? Is she housing the baby after he's born? Raising him until he's 18? Assuming all the financial costs as well as funding of college or whatever vocation he decides to pursue? Is she providing health insurance? Does she know your family's medical history for doctor appointments? \n\nYeah, I didn't think so. It's not her baby. Unless it took three people to make this baby she doesn't get a say. It's absolutely crazy to me that NO ONE in that family is seeing that. Part of me says stick to your guns and don't go. Part of me says go and every time she mentions Tommy ignore it and if she asks you about Tommy give her a confused look and ask who she is talking about. Part of me says to go and rename everyone there including your husband and bring stockings filled with goodies with their new names. I think they're all a bit bonkers.
