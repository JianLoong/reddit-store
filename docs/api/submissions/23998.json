TW: miscarriage/stillbirth.\n\nI (26f) am planning my wedding to my fiance (27m) in a few months. Everything is going great and I love him so much. I can't wait to spend my life with him. He loves my family, and I, for the most part, love his.\n\nA bit of background, fiance has a much older brother. While my future MIL was pregnant three times in between them, all of them resulted in late miscarriages and stillbirths. As a result, MIL put all of her motherly love and attention on fiance. He had never tried a fruit or vegetable before I met him because his parents never made him when he was young and he had grown up assuming they were gross. (I got him to try some and he loves them now.)\n\nAs we were planning our guest list, we consulted our families about which, and how many, relatives we should invite. Future MIL asked that we \"invite\" fiance's dead brother and sisters. When we asked what she meant, she wanted us to put up a framed photo of the dead babies in the pews at our wedding ceremony, and then save them seats at our reception.\n\nI was horrified. First of all, we are trying to have a fairly small wedding to start with, and a beautiful, intimate venue. We can only have seats for 30-50 people, and I would like these places to be for our friends and family, not people who have never met either of us because they are dead. Fiance agrees that three of 50 seats reserved for dead people is too many. He suggested we compromise and just let MIL put up all three photos in one seat. \n\nPersonally, I think it's gross and weird to include any of them. We're starting our lives together. We want to have a family and it almost seems like a bad omen, but it means a lot to her and it's a fairly small ask.

That\u2019s the weirdest and creepiest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9. It\u2019s not about anyone else or what they want, it\u2019s about the two of you and what you want. \n\nI can\u2019t even imagine going to someone\u2019s wedding and there been photographs of dead babies in the pews. I can\u2019t even imagine how traumatic that could be for some people who have experienced a miscarriage or stillbirth. \n\nI would be drawing a firm, firm boundary. I don\u2019t even understand your fianc\u00e9 trying to compromise and potentially choosing to have those photos at your wedding. It\u2019s not the time, nor the place.\n\nIf I wanted to tread carefully, I think my response would be, \u201cWe don\u2019t know the personal stories of everyone attending our wedding and we have no idea whether or not some of our guests could potentially find photographs of dead babies traumatic. It\u2019s not a risk we\u2019re willing to take.\u201d\n\nBut, I probably wouldn\u2019t tread carefully, I would instead just be firm with boundaries. I think it\u2019s important to have a really clear conversation with your fianc\u00e9 about this.", "NTA. That would be so disturbing; no one wants to see pictures of a dead baby at a wedding. My husband\u2019s grandmother died shortly before our wedding, so we added an \u201cin memory of\u201d line to our wedding program to acknowledge her. I truly hope your future MIL gets the counseling she needs.", "OP, this is a test\u2026.of your fianc\u00e9. If he doesn\u2019t back you up 100% on this issue, you should seriously reconsider marrying him. Do you really want to marry someone who caters to unreasonable, even crazy, requests from his mother?", "NTA. Your wedding is about you and your fiance, not your MIL's tragic past. I understand that she wants to honor her lost children, but this is not the appropriate time or place. It's disrespectful to you, your fiance, and your guests to have photos of dead babies at a celebration of life and love. It's also very creepy and morbid, in my opinion.\r  \n\r  \nYour MIL needs to understand that this is not her wedding, and she can't impose her wishes on you. She may be paying for most of it, but that doesn't give her the right to make such a bizarre and insensitive request. You are not obligated to accommodate her, especially if it makes you uncomfortable or unhappy.\r  \n\r  \nYou and your fiance need to stand your ground and tell her no. This is your day, and you deserve to have it the way you want it. Don't let her guilt-trip you or manipulate you into doing something you don't want to do. She needs to respect your boundaries and your choices.", "NTA. Tell MIL that the photos may be triggering to people who recently had miscarriages, and you don't want your wedding (repeat, your wedding) to be a source of grief for the guests (and you).  Edit to add - maybe you could give her the opportunity during the reception speeches to say something about how she wishes her lost children could have been there. Not that she needs that time either, since it's a wedding, but if she insists on hijacking a wedding with a memorial service, then something verbal, after the ceremony, seems less intrusive.", "Holy mother of Moses, I'm sorry, WHAT??\n\nWHAT THE ........ O.O", "NTA.

Yes it is sad that she had 3 miscarriages but that should be a topic of discussion or a display at a wedding. I\u2019m sorry but I would put my foot down about this one because putting a spotlight on that at your wedding will cause all kinds of negative feelings g in people let alone you. Talk to your man and get him to see how wrong this is and help him talk her down. Personally if I walked into a friend\u2019s wedding and saw a display like that, I\u2019d ask why it\u2019s there and then after finding out I\u2019d sit back waiting for a shit show to start and not be thinking how happy of an occasion today is supposed to be.

Usually done for a beloved parent or grandparent.", "NTA. No to all of this. Just no.", "NTA How morbid!  My mom had an infant son a year before I was born who lived for 2 hours.  She never inflicted us with photos of our dead brother at our celebrations.  I never knew he existed until I was half grown and found his little pictures in his tiny little coffin when I was snooping.  I brought them to her and said who is this?  And she told me, but it made her cry.  He was too precious to her to be putting his pictures up at our celebrations for people to gawk at.", "NTA\n\nThis may seem like overreacting but I would seriously consider what you're getting into here. Not eating a fruit or vegetable until adulthood is *weird as fuck*. The dead baby thing is *weird as fuck*. When you marry someone you are marrying their family too . . some problems here or there are one thing but you are marrying into a freak show. \n\nOf course in some instances people are well rounded and successful despite their crazy family but the fact that your fiance supports this idea, and also has some responsibility for his not eating fruits or veggies, means he has some crazy in him as well.", "NTA. \n\nA wedding is about you and your spouse to be, but then here is the only request of someone that is footing most of your expenses, and while it is a very  strange request, it comes from a place of pain. Not an easy thing OP. \n\nI feel for your MIL to be,  but I am also confused. Pardon my ignorance and apologies if this is a trigger. I believed if someone had a miscarriage, it would likely be in the 1st or 2nd trimester where...forgive for putting this indelicately, a photograph is a sonogram. What exactly was she planning as a photo? \n\nYou have great advice on how to suggest this. Remind her also that while she had your fiance, you may have attendees that may have never had that joy (of a successful delivery) after the pain of loss. If you are comfortable,  you could suggest a private event with just family honoring any potential siblings he may have had just before or after the ceremony. I know a couple that did this, albeit for the couple's deceased family (his dad, his brother, her mom, her sister, their dog)\n\nGood luck!", "NTA.  You could try suggesting that instead of photos you place an individual flower representing each baby perhaps on a small table near yours at the reception. Something like that.", "Damn.

I have actually heard of the table thing before. Normally it's a photo table with close relatives who passed, think parents, grandparents, relationships like that. Sometimes there's a photo of the bride and groom as well (or photos of them with said relative).\n\n Never seen the saving a seat though. A friend of mines mother did carry a photo (sonogram) of a baby she had lost. She didn't talk about it or make a show of it, I only know since the bride told me and I was in the wedding party.", "NTA, she is overstepping and in a very strange way.", "NTA. It's not appropriate to put up photos of dead people at a wedding. This should be a firm hard no.", "Sometimes people have a small table at the entrance to the church with photos of deceased family members or a framed poem of remembrance. Saving seats at the reception is a hard no.", "NTA \n\nNope. No. No way. The fuck not. Not today satan. \n\nI would leave your wedding, even if I was a bridesmaid out of the sheer principal of: this is abhorrent and completely unhinged. \n\nAlso consider... If this is the wedding, what's she going to want after it? And how easy will she get it cos she simply wants it and no one will say no.\n\nThis isn't like a photo of a dead parent. This is a whole what the actual fuck and why has no one taken this woman to therapy situation", "You need to pay for your own wedding and then you can make all the decisions.  MIL is a sick woman.  She will continue to meddle in your lives.  Wait till you have your first child.  If I could be a fly on the wall for that one. Man are you in trouble.  And no seats should not be saved for dead anythings.", "She wants a memorial she can organize a memorial.\n\nThis is your wedding.", "Sorry for two comments, but I can't stop thinking about this and ... is this something she also does at every birthday party?", "Do you have a rehearsal dinner?\n\nMaybe you can suggest that you do a small lighting of a candle or something really small and non-intrusive for the three, at the end of the dinner, have a small two paragraph that there is mention made and a  moment held for those that went before? (could include any other deceased members here too)\n\nI've heard the chair thing in other reddit posts, and it's usually a breaking point, especially since you have limited seats. So maybe deflect her attention from it at the rehearsal, and then it doesn't have to be mentioned again for the wedding. If she brings it up, just kindly say we have honoured them already, this is husband and my day now.", "Other people have already made pretty solid, logical arguments as to why this is not something that should be done, so I will just weigh in with my Simple Words by saying that you are NTA because your MIL's idea is just fucked in the head.

I can\u2019t imagine the physical and mental anguish that the mother went through, and I\u2019m sure you both have sympathy for her, but someone else\u2019s wedding is just not the place. \n\nMaybe a memorial of some sort, or something symbolic could be an option, but actual photos would be so incredibly distressing to the other guests, let alone you guys as the bride and groom.\n\nTry suggesting small memorial teddy bears, candles, maybe even a special type of flower that could be integrated into a corsage, boutonni\u00e8re, etc. That way you could still accommodate her wishes but it wouldn\u2019t be upsetting or take up physical seats at YOUR wedding.\n\nBest of luck with this OP, and remember before anything else that this is YOUR day and you can set boundaries in a way that is still respectful and loving.", "NAH but I'd never agree to the request. Instead maybe a speech in honor of those who can't be with you on the day, a sign honoring them by name somewhere, or some other compromise that isn't so damned unsettling at a wedding.", "The ick is strong in this one.", "NTA. And honestly, do you and your groom want to spend your wedding day explaining away the photos of dead babies? If I were a guest at that wedding, that would be the only thing I remembered about it.", "NTA. I have heard of people honouring dead relatives by putting pictures up. But I think it's normally photos of people the couple were close to, like a grandparent or parent etc. This sounds a bit off to me.", "NTA\n\nI remember a family wedding, where a close relative (mother of the bride's stepmother, so effectively grandmother) died just before the wedding. \n\nWe honoured her memory, but  didn't have a seat for her \n\nMy mother lost twins due to a miscarriage, years before I was born. They are not part of the family .", "NTA I\u2019d honestly believe that to be a bad omen as well. It\u2019s meant to be a celebration of your love not honoring the death of people you or your husband never met.", "As someone who has lost children,  I would be offended seeing those pictures because they would trigger me. I would agree to having a corsage made for mother in law with the babies names or a dove release??", "It may trigger some of your guests , then the wedding is ruined. I'd let her put 3 small photos on her table. Explain its more intimate for her too", "NTA.\nI understand where your future MIL is coming from, but the idea of seeing pictures of dead babies is disturbing in that context. I 100% understand what your saying about it being a bad omen.\nCould you maybe put up something to represent them/pay them tribute? Like teddy bears, angel figurines or something? I feel that would be a cute way to remember them on this special day without making people uncomfortable.", "INFO: Are you planning on having a memorial table for any other loved ones that have passed?", "NTA your MIL is trying to make YOUR wedding about her and her dead children. This is a ploy for her to get attention and have everything about her and her loss. Not to mention this would be a potential huge trigger for someone who lost a child. This is a small window into how she and your hubby are going to handle things in the future. You need to nip this in the bud or you\u2019re in for lots of trouble with her and your hubby doing what she wants and disregarding you and your feelings.", "Yeah..... no.... NTA. I would hate to be the person sitting next to them. Get the  hills for sure. Maybe put a flower to represent each in the flowers or something... not dead baby photos.", "This is beyond creepy! \n\nShe literally wants to traumatise everyone with pictures of dead babies and ruin the entire day. That's so vile and just completely detached from reality.", "NTA and let me congratulate you on the most original MIL story I've read on here in a long, long time!", "Rather than pictures (which sounds extremely traumatic) why not just...uh..like mention them by name in one of the speeches to like honor them I think that should be enough. \n\nAbsolutely not! To the pictures. If your MIL doesn't listen to you then don't be the one to speak up. If she listens more to her son or her husband or any family member that you noticed she usually agrees with then ask them to do the talking \n\nNTA", "NTA.  I think it's perfectly normal to want to include a spot for the would-be siblings, if that's something your fianc\u00e9 wants, but having actual pictures of stillborn/miscarried babies is totally NOT NORMAL. Not to mention how awful it would be to other people who have struggled with infertility and child loss to show up at what they believe is supposed to be a happy occasion and be presented with a literal visual reminder of their own personal pain & struggle.", "NTA. No pictures of dead baby! Allow her to have a small \u2018in memory\u2019 spot/chair but no dead babies.", "NTA. This is over the line. But... if she is dead set on this idea and outright saying no is going to cause issues, what you could do is get miniature memorial seats with their names on it in a small and tasteful memorial display.. That way, there is no uncomfortable photos taking up seats and future MIL is happy. Something like this:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/1163354983/wedding-memorial-set-loved-ones-in", "We have a table of memories at family weddings for those that have passed, but saving them a seat?? Has MIL sought  therapy? Not discounting the trauma of the losses as I'm going through my own, but this is... not normal", "NTA  \n\n\nEven if you were having a big wedding, no way in hell would I put up photos of dead/unborn babies. That's creepy af.", "NTA that is a terrible request, photos of dead babies will be very upsetting for your guests. If you want to extend an olive branch you could propose three small candles on a side table with a few flowers or something else subtle to acknowledge them without upsetting all your guests or turning your wedding into a memorial sevice.", "NTA - I've officiated at a lot of weddings and never seen pictures of deceased babies. However, I have seen a Memorial tables - you can find examples on Google. People often have pictures or momentos from deceased grandparents or other relatives on them.\n\n If you wanted to compromise, perhaps MIL could contribute one thing per child to a memorial table at the reception - a name card and a pair of baby shoes or a baby hat, for example. It doesn't have to be morbid, it can be a way to honour people who would have been a part of your life of things had turned out different.", "NTA and I don\u2019t even want to know what she\u2019s going to be like if you have kids\nGood grief!!!", "Nta it would be way different if those children actually lived and became known then I feel honoring them would be more appropriate. Unfortunately her miscarriages and all those creepy dead baby pictures need to go back in the box.", "You\u2019re marrying into crazy. Watch out", "NTA. \n\nThis doesn't even make sense. It's *your* wedding, not MILs. You invite people *you* know and want there. If she had a wedding, she could do that if she wished. If you had a dead relative who you were very close to, that would also be a normal thing to do. \n\nBut her wanting a spot for her dead babies is absolutely bizarre.", "No. That is disturbing. Your future MIL needs psychiatric help and your fiance needs to tell her that or suggest it to her. If you go through with this wedding, you should appoint at least two people to keep an eye on her at your wedding. and have her removed if necessary. She will most likely try something. This seems like a giant red flag that she will try to control your marriage as well.", "NTA\n\nIt is a strange, and inappropriate, request for your wedding.\n\nI would not recommend having such a mournful symbol at your joyful event. However, if your fiance puts pressure on you to 'compromise', have one flower arrangement to represent all of them.\n\nI would not recommend including them in your wedding events.", "She and your future FIL should, ON A DIFFERENT DAY, renew their vows and have seats for their dead children. Maybe you can suggest this and give her something to focus on instead of hijacking YOUR wedding.", "NTA\n\nMIL sounds like they need a lot of grief counselling and support. What they have asked for is frightful and indicates they are crying out for help, what they asked for is extremely unusual and will likely be triggering for other guests at your wedding.", "NTA,that's some truly sick shit", "NTA and hell no. Not on that day or any other. Jfc some of you peoples lives are wild ASF.", "NTA. I too would see this as a bad omen. It\u2019s wildly inappropriate as well. If you feel this strongly about it please set a hard boundary. Otherwise you\u2019ll be compromising your comfort for what your MIL wants for the rest of your married life.", "Hell no. That's why I don't like people paying for stuff. Then they think they are in control \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11 FOH!! Maybe you could light candles or something else to honor them? Saved seats and pictures of stillborn babies? No.", "NTA!! At first I assumed it was pictures of the ultrasounds. That would've been more reasonable (i still would have declined if i were you), but pictures of stillbirth/miscarriages? That's insane and so dark to have for a wedding.", "This is such an odd request. Makes me a bit afraid for you. MIL to-be is off her rocker. Having the pictures of the stillborn babies serves to remind everyone at your celebration of her enduring loss. \n\nNarcissism shows up in 3 ways. One that I think is coming into play here is covert. By being the victim, she maintains attention. How else could she let everyone at the wedding that she is the victim? How else could she possibly divert attention from the bride and groom than to have pictures of her 2 dead babies at the events?\n\nWhen you marry, you marry into a family. I would take some time to consider the relationship between the son and his mother. Will he forever take her side? Will he placate her need to be the center of attention? What happens when/if you have children? Is she going to behave as if they are her children?\n\nYikes. This is the proverbial Pandora's Box.", "This is a woman who didn\u2019t think it mattered that her son had never eaten fruit or vegetables in his whole life. Her judgement is way off. \n\nNTA, but the problem is what happens next? I suppose you\u2019ll have to come to a compromise, have some kind of representation of them at the wedding, but not photos. That\u2019s just weird.", "\n>weirdest and creepiest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\n\n\nOr another day on AITA with the wildest of wildest behaviour of humanity. \n\nFrankly OP, it can be disturbing/triggering for other wedding attendees who has gone through similar experiences of stillbirth/miscarriage to see that the pictures at the function. The occasion can turn somber. \n\nIf it was MIL's wedding, she can do what she wants (still creepy, though). Since your fiance feels nothing much for the cause, you have got nothing to worry and assert yourself. NTA, OP.", "Yeah as a currently pregnant woman, this would just really upset me. OP needs to protect her guests from this shit", "What's more fun than pictures of dead children at a wedding?", "When my boys were in HS my parents were Very supportive of everything they did. \n\nMy mother passed away before my oldest earned his Eagle Scout award. We put a small bouquet of flowers on the table in her memory with a note about all the support she had given him. It was tucked in the back of the table with all his Merritt badges and pictures of his project. No photo of his grandma.\n\nMaybe on the gift table a small bouquet of three pink and blue carnations. They could be in memory of his missing siblings. That's it. No graphic dead baby photos, no empty chairs, no \"big over the top\" show! \n\nIt's not about you MIL and giving up \"the boy who lived.\"\n\nIt's a wedding the joining of two people.\n\nLord help op, MIL is going to be all up in your business til the day she dies.\n\nEdit to say NTAH", "Very good point about it being upsetting. \nMy cousin had a stillborn baby and seeing pics like this would deeply upset her and her husband.", "Sure, summon the ghosts of your dead children and offer them food and wine to appease their spirits. Good idea.", "You and your fiance need to stand your ground and tell her no.", "Yup. I've had two miscarriages, seeing something like that would kill me. Just thinking about it gives me the shivers.", "I had a picture of my Dad at my wedding, but the difference is (and this is going to be harsh) he was alive when it was taken. I\u2019ve worked maternity, and I don\u2019t care how the staff dresses things up, a dead baby looks like exactly what it is. It\u2019s honestly sick to want these pictures displayed at a wedding.", "This right here. \u261d\ud83c\udffc. Red flag city.", "He agrees with me that it's a gross request, but he thinks compromise will avoid some drama. He's worried that if we flat out say no that she will keep asking.", "I hope the fiance is willing to stand up for OP and not his mother here. If he's been babied all his life, this will be a true test of his ability to cut the apron strings. \n\nNTA, OP.

Better to stand your ground now", "If they're ultrasounds rather than memorial portrait photos, you have other grounds to object: most people seeing ultrasound photos displayed at a wedding would only interpret that in one way, and do you really want to spend your entire wedding explaining to guests that no, this isn't a pregnancy announcement?", "It's two sonograms and a photo of the stillborn.", "As an event planner I understand your reluctance to honor this request.
