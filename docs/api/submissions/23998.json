TW: miscarriage/stillbirth.\n\nI (26f) am planning my wedding to my fiance (27m) in a few months. Everything is going great and I love him so much. I can't wait to spend my life with him. He loves my family, and I, for the most part, love his.\n\nA bit of background, fiance has a much older brother. While my future MIL was pregnant three times in between them, all of them resulted in late miscarriages and stillbirths. As a result, MIL put all of her motherly love and attention on fiance. He had never tried a fruit or vegetable before I met him because his parents never made him when he was young and he had grown up assuming they were gross. (I got him to try some and he loves them now.)\n\nAs we were planning our guest list, we consulted our families about which, and how many, relatives we should invite. Future MIL asked that we \"invite\" fiance's dead brother and sisters. When we asked what she meant, she wanted us to put up a framed photo of the dead babies in the pews at our wedding ceremony, and then save them seats at our reception.\n\nI was horrified. First of all, we are trying to have a fairly small wedding to start with, and a beautiful, intimate venue. We can only have seats for 30-50 people, and I would like these places to be for our friends and family, not people who have never met either of us because they are dead. Fiance agrees that three of 50 seats reserved for dead people is too many. He suggested we compromise and just let MIL put up all three photos in one seat. \n\nPersonally, I think it's gross and weird to include any of them. We're starting our lives together. We want to have a family and it almost seems like a bad omen, but it means a lot to her and it's a fairly small ask. Fiance's parents are paying for 75% of our wedding, and this is the only request she's had.

That\u2019s the weirdest and creepiest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.", "NTA.\n\nYour wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9. It\u2019s not about anyone else or what they want, it\u2019s about the two of you and what you want. \n\nI can\u2019t even imagine going to someone\u2019s wedding and there been photographs of dead babies in the pews. I can\u2019t even imagine how traumatic that could be for some people who have experienced a miscarriage or stillbirth. \n\nI would be drawing a firm, firm boundary. I don\u2019t even understand your fianc\u00e9 trying to compromise and potentially choosing to have those photos at your wedding. It\u2019s not the time, nor the place.\n\nIf I wanted to tread carefully, I think my response would be, \u201cWe don\u2019t know the personal stories of everyone attending our wedding and we have no idea whether or not some of our guests could potentially find photographs of dead babies traumatic. It\u2019s not a risk we\u2019re willing to take.\u201d\n\nBut, I probably wouldn\u2019t tread carefully, I would instead just be firm with boundaries. I think it\u2019s important to have a really clear conversation with your fianc\u00e9 about this.", "NTA. That would be so disturbing; no one wants to see pictures of a dead baby at a wedding. My husband\u2019s grandmother died shortly before our wedding, so we added an \u201cin memory of\u201d line to our wedding program to acknowledge her. I truly hope your future MIL gets the counseling she needs.", "OP, this is a test\u2026.of your fianc\u00e9. If he doesn\u2019t back you up 100% on this issue, you should seriously reconsider marrying him. Do you really want to marry someone who caters to unreasonable, even crazy, requests from his mother?", "NTA. Your wedding is about you and your fiance, not your MIL's tragic past. I understand that she wants to honor her lost children, but this is not the appropriate time or place. It's disrespectful to you, your fiance, and your guests to have photos of dead babies at a celebration of life and love. It's also very creepy and morbid, in my opinion.\r  \n\r  \nYour MIL needs to understand that this is not her wedding, and she can't impose her wishes on you. She may be paying for most of it, but that doesn't give her the right to make such a bizarre and insensitive request. You are not obligated to accommodate her, especially if it makes you uncomfortable or unhappy.\r  \n\r  \nYou and your fiance need to stand your ground and tell her no. This is your day, and you deserve to have it the way you want it. Don't let her guilt-trip you or manipulate you into doing something you don't want to do. She needs to respect your boundaries and your choices.", "NTA. Tell MIL that the photos may be triggering to people who recently had miscarriages, and you don't want your wedding (repeat, your wedding) to be a source of grief for the guests (and you).  Edit to add - maybe you could give her the opportunity during the reception speeches to say something about how she wishes her lost children could have been there. Not that she needs that time either, since it's a wedding, but if she insists on hijacking a wedding with a memorial service, then something verbal, after the ceremony, seems less intrusive.", "Holy mother of Moses, I'm sorry, WHAT??\n\nWHAT THE ........ O.O", "NTA. This is just too weird and she clearly needs to go to therapy to learn how to manage her feelings about her losses, not expect people to make space for her dead children during their special times.", "Nta very strange.\nNo disrespect but this is YOUR and your finances event", "Nta elope, you'll be happier for it and can do it cheap enough to not take her money.", "NTA but this is next level unhinged.

Yes it is sad that she had 3 miscarriages but that should be a topic of discussion or a display at a wedding. I\u2019m sorry but I would put my foot down about this one because putting a spotlight on that at your wedding will cause all kinds of negative feelings g in people let alone you. Talk to your man and get him to see how wrong this is and help him talk her down. Personally if I walked into a friend\u2019s wedding and saw a display like that, I\u2019d ask why it\u2019s there and then after finding out I\u2019d sit back waiting for a shit show to start and not be thinking how happy of an occasion today is supposed to be.

Usually done for a beloved parent or grandparent.", "NTA. No to all of this. Just no.", "NTA How morbid!  My mom had an infant son a year before I was born who lived for 2 hours.  She never inflicted us with photos of our dead brother at our celebrations.  I never knew he existed until I was half grown and found his little pictures in his tiny little coffin when I was snooping.  I brought them to her and said who is this?  And she told me, but it made her cry.  He was too precious to her to be putting his pictures up at our celebrations for people to gawk at.", "NTA\n\nThis may seem like overreacting but I would seriously consider what you're getting into here. Not eating a fruit or vegetable until adulthood is *weird as fuck*. The dead baby thing is *weird as fuck*. When you marry someone you are marrying their family too . . some problems here or there are one thing but you are marrying into a freak show. \n\nOf course in some instances people are well rounded and successful despite their crazy family but the fact that your fiance supports this idea, and also has some responsibility for his not eating fruits or veggies, means he has some crazy in him as well.", "NTA. \n\nA wedding is about you and your spouse to be, but then here is the only request of someone that is footing most of your expenses, and while it is a very  strange request, it comes from a place of pain. Not an easy thing OP. \n\nI feel for your MIL to be,  but I am also confused. Pardon my ignorance and apologies if this is a trigger. I believed if someone had a miscarriage, it would likely be in the 1st or 2nd trimester where...forgive for putting this indelicately, a photograph is a sonogram. What exactly was she planning as a photo? \n\nYou already have great advice on how to suggest this. You can also remind her also that while she had your fiance, you may have attendees that may have never had that joy (of a successful delivery) after the pain of loss. If you are comfortable,  you could suggest a private event with just family honoring any potential siblings he may have had just before or after the ceremony. I know a couple that did this, albeit for the couple's deceased family (his dad, his brother, her mom, her sister, their dog)\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit (clarity, grammar)", "NTA.

I have actually heard of the table thing before. Normally it's a photo table with close relatives who passed, think parents, grandparents, relationships like that. Sometimes there's a photo of the bride and groom as well (or photos of them with said relative).\n\n Never seen the saving a seat though. A friend of mines mother did carry a photo (sonogram) of a baby she had lost. She didn't talk about it or make a show of it, I only know since the bride told me and I was in the wedding party.", "NTA, she is overstepping and in a very strange way.", "NTA. It's not appropriate to put up photos of dead people at a wedding. This should be a firm hard no.", "Sometimes people have a small table at the entrance to the church with photos of deceased family members or a framed poem of remembrance. Saving seats at the reception is a hard no.", "NTA \n\nNope. No. No way. The fuck not. Not today satan. \n\nI would leave your wedding, even if I was a bridesmaid out of the sheer principal of: this is abhorrent and completely unhinged. \n\nAlso consider... If this is the wedding, what's she going to want after it? And how easy will she get it cos she simply wants it and no one will say no.\n\nThis isn't like a photo of a dead parent. This is a whole what the actual fuck and why has no one taken this woman to therapy situation", "You need to pay for your own wedding and then you can make all the decisions.  MIL is a sick woman.  She will continue to meddle in your lives.  Wait till you have your first child.  If I could be a fly on the wall for that one. Man are you in trouble.  And no seats should not be saved for dead anythings.", "She wants a memorial she can organize a memorial.\n\nThis is your wedding.", "Sorry for two comments, but I can't stop thinking about this and ... is this something she also does at every birthday party?", "Do you have a rehearsal dinner?\n\nMaybe you can suggest that you do a small lighting of a candle or something really small and non-intrusive for the three, at the end of the dinner, have a small two paragraph that there is mention made and a  moment held for those that went before? (could include any other deceased members here too)\n\nI've heard the chair thing in other reddit posts, and it's usually a breaking point, especially since you have limited seats. So maybe deflect her attention from it at the rehearsal, and then it doesn't have to be mentioned again for the wedding. If she brings it up, just kindly say we have honoured them already, this is husband and my day now.", "Other people have already made pretty solid, logical arguments as to why this is not something that should be done, so I will just weigh in with my Simple Words by saying that you are NTA because your MIL's idea is just fucked in the head.

I can\u2019t imagine the physical and mental anguish that the mother went through, and I\u2019m sure you both have sympathy for her, but someone else\u2019s wedding is just not the place. \n\nMaybe a memorial of some sort, or something symbolic could be an option, but actual photos would be so incredibly distressing to the other guests, let alone you guys as the bride and groom.\n\nTry suggesting small memorial teddy bears, candles, maybe even a special type of flower that could be integrated into a corsage, boutonni\u00e8re, etc. That way you could still accommodate her wishes but it wouldn\u2019t be upsetting or take up physical seats at YOUR wedding.\n\nBest of luck with this OP, and remember before anything else that this is YOUR day and you can set boundaries in a way that is still respectful and loving.", "NAH but I'd never agree to the request.
