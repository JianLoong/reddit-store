You or your wife could have arranged the kids eat something else. She shouldn\u2019t be expected to cater dinner for all of you just because you\u2019re visiting. Your wife was rude and entitled. Your mom absolutely shouldn\u2019t have said that she didn\u2019t like your daughter, but I get why she may not like her if this is a typical occurrence to something as simple as wanting to make a dinner. Like, she wanted to make her son a meal and it turned into some hellscape because Riley wouldn\u2019t like it, and your wife is pissed off because your mom should be catering her every meal\u2026and somehow, that\u2019s your mother\u2019s fault. And your wife made her out to be a \u2018bad host\u2019 because she wanted to make her son his favorite meal? Your mom even said something vital: that she wanted a relationship with her son. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that, and from this one post, I feel like your wife feels like a power struggle with her and you have pulled away from your mom. \n\nYou and your wife could have said \u2018cool! I\u2019ll order pizza for the kids because they won\u2019t eat that.\u2019 \n\nBut the funny (not funny haha, just funny strange) thing is this: \n\n>I screamed at her that is the is that selfish and emotionally stunted she never should have had a kid and she doesn\u2019t deserve to be a mother\u2026I told her that I hated her for what she said about my daughter and have fun in a nursing home.\n\nIn conjunction with:\n\n\n>I haven\u2019t seen my mom in two years (snip)Zahedan has been blowing me off and giving excuses, finally I had a serious conversation and asked what was going on.\n\nAnd\n\n>since then she has made excuses not to see us, so I finally tried to talk to her about it and I was floored.\n\nHow could it not be obvious to you? Like, were you really that confused? **You told her you hated her, that she wasn\u2019t worthy to have a kid, and that you were going to abandon her.** Those are awful words that probably can\u2019t be taken back. You don\u2019t know if you were too harsh???? Are you kidding me?", "YTA. So is Your Wife! Your Mom's Place is not a restaurant you can't just order ala carte. If you have a picky eater you need to plan for it and cook for them. If you are guest for several days you need to shop and cook (or carry out) not sit on your ass complaining about the \"service\".", "YTA\n\nYour mother had wanted to do something nice for you to show her love but your daughter and wife made her feel bad for it. You didn't discuss it with her or indicate your appreciation for your mother's thoughtfulness, you just left them to disagree.\n\nWhen you asked your mother why she had withdrawn and she told you, you screamed at her and were abusive? You should definitely feel terrible about it. \n\nYes, kids are picky eaters, but that doesn't mean you can attack people if they don't cater to them. Your wife was really rude and entitled. Your description of her behaviour and the way she treated your mother is making me cringe. If Riley needs special consideration then you as the parents manage that as gracefully as you can without making your host suffer. \n\nIt's true that your mother should not have said she didn't like your daughter, but what you should consider is: why would she feel like that? Do you and your wife manage Riley's pickiness or does it always end the way that meal did, with your mother being inconvenienced and attacked?\n\nI am so upset for your poor mother. How could you treat her like that? You should go and see her without your family and apologize for what you said, and then you should find some way to manage the situation without all the burden and discomfort falling on your mother", "Holy \\[poop\\], yes, YTA. And I'll toss your wife, also, into that mix. \n\nYou all were visiting your mom. She was planning on making something special *for you*. Rather than accept that nice gesture, you start acting as if she's a short order cook. Then, when your mom offers a solution that your wife make something else for your picky 13 year old to eat, here comes your wife piling on. (Although, to be fair, your mother could have and should have put that onus on Riley to make herself a peanut butter sandwich or some scrambled eggs; a 13 year old should be able to do that much for herself.) Frankly, your picky daughter sounds like a spoiled brat. Kids need to try at least three bites of a new food, even if it looks or sounds \"gross\" at first. And if they are truly that picky, they need to learn to cook for others so that their pickiness doesn't derail everyone else.\n\nI can see why your mother is not eager to host you all again. You sound like horrible guests. You need to apologize profusely. Invite your mother to visit you. And you need to pay for the trip, to make her meals, and to otherwise pamper her while she visits. Why? Because you and your wife are responsible for the rift, and you're the ones who need to make amends.", "I completely understand, I wouldn\u2019t invite your family back either. Your wife could have simply made something for Riley to eat. I\u2019m a picky eater, I don\u2019t eat at people\u2019s houses because I know the effort someone made to cook only for me not to eat and complain about the food. YTA, keep your family home.", "YTA. You and your wife and kids sound like a bunch of entitled AHs. Merry Christmas", "YTA Your mom was \ud83d\udcaf right about your family.\n\nYour all very entitled.    \n\nYou haven't improved, you said you used to be worse, you haven't improved now.", "YTA \n\nI wouldn't invite any of you nasty entitled assholes back into my home either.", "Yta  - I can see where Riley gets it. Teaching your kids they have to challenge themselves  in order not to hurt other people's feelings is basic good parenting.  From what you have said your mother was completely correct if undiplomatic - she told you what you needed to hear. If you are still screaming down the phone at your mom you are not an adult. \n\nWell that's at least two us telling you that you're fucking up. I suggest apologising to your mother.", "YTA. Your mother is tight and you an you and your family are entitled and wrong. You sort your own kids out yourself, your mother doesn't have to accommodate them and she wanted to do something nice for you. Instead than being grateful you just threw a tantrum. You do not deserve your mother.", "YTA.  I'm deathly allergic to onions, can't even be in the room with an onion.  Grocery shopping is a challenge in itself (stores have onions).  Instead of having the entire world change for me and inconveniencing everyone else, I bring my own food or don't go.  It's a simple fix that's on you as the parent, not on the person who cooks the meal.", "YTA \n\nYou and your wife are ridiculous. Your mom graciously offered to let you cook something else for your spoiled brat and you blew it out of proportion. You in fact are the entitled ones.", "Let me break it down for you:\n\nYou were not the asshole in being considering your kids preferences when choosing dinner. \n\nYour wife was the asshole when she told your mom she was being a bad host. \n\nYou were the asshole when refusing to let your MOM make YOUR favorite dish at HER house. (How do you not think bossing people around in their own home is rude?)\n\nYou were not the asshole for addressing the tension. \n\nYou were the asshole for screaming at her when she explained why.\n\nNot only were you \u201ctoo harsh,\u201d YOU are the one who is \u201cselfish and emotionally stunted.\u201d You were self-centered and ungrateful. Call your mom, sincerely apologize, and sit down with your wife to make sure she understands where you both went wrong.", "I know you mentioned you were worse as a teenager but where you rude to your grandparents or to people whose homes you were visiting.\n\nIt is one thing for kids to have issues when they are home. And to make demands about food when they are home.\n\nIt\u2019s a full different thing to make demands at someone\u2019s house they are visiting.", "Wow YTA big time.\n\nI\u2019m gonna say your mom is right in saying Riley is spoiled, because what kind of education can you expect from a GROWN MAN yelling at his mom that he hates her the minute she makes a comment ?\n\nBtw, she is right in saying the choices you make for your daughter (or lack thereof in this case) should not burden other people. How entitled are you ? If Riley decides she rather use the living room instead of a bathroom are you going to FREAKING LOSE IT on your mom when she makes a comment ?\n\nObviously, if you choose to impose your poorly educated daughter onto others, don\u2019t expect renewed invitations. You made a choice, others are entitled to make their own.", "YTA. \n\nYou and wife were given a solution and wife acted horrendously.", "YTA and your wife and daughter do sound high maintenance, which is fine if that\u2019s good with you but when you\u2019re staying at someone\u2019s home and they\u2019re cooking for you then you eat what you get. AND your mom tried to make it work by allowing y\u2019all to get some for Riley before she seasoned the food and offered to be cool with you making something else. \n\nJust because they\u2019re related does not mean your mom has to like your daughter, not everybody gets along.", "YTA", "YTA!  Geeeeez,i hope your mother never has to deal with you and your wife again.", "So let me get this straight\u2026 your mother wanted to make you one of your favorite meals but since your daughter wouldn\u2019t eat it, y\u2019all created a big brouhaha. You or your wife could have easily made something else for Riley. Your mother is not a Burger King; you each can\u2019t have it your way. She tried to do something nice for you and you threw it back in her face. Riley is going to have a rude awakening when she realizes that not everyone is going to be willing to kowtow to her pickiness. YTA.", "YTA man. Imagine if you went over to dinner to anyone that wasn't your Mom, how your child and your wife acted was improper and overly-entitled. Then you threatened your Mom with a nursing home because she didn't want to be treated like a doormat by your family anymore. Yikes dude.", "It sounds like your family objected to the meal before your mom even made it, which seems pretty rude...that they wouldn't even try it. Also, if your wife/kids didn't want your mom to make the blue cheese/spicy dish, what did your wife expect? Wasn't it kind of on your wife to make a suitable meal? Instead of making something herself, it sounds like your wife just made your mom feel worse...\n\nYTA", "YTA as far as your reaction to your mom. You insisted to know what the issue is and then you react like that? Note that I'm not addressing your mom's actions during your last visit. Just your reaction to what she told you. Horrible, horrible things to say to anyone let alone your own mother.", "YTA. That last paragraph was such a whopping escalation, I'm going to guess there's a lot of other resentment at play that you aren't sharing with us. As far as the meals go, I'm really confused by the statement \"she would offer us to take the food before it was seasoned, but she wouldn't help\". Sounds like your mum tried to suggest solutions and you just aren't happy with them. She's not a bad host for wanting you to eat a favourite meal of yours.", "YTA. How was there any mystery about why your mom wasn\u2019t inviting you over? Seriously. I\u2019d love to understand how you didn\u2019t know. You literally screamed at her that she didn\u2019t deserve the title of mother. And this is after your wife made a huge deal out of an issue she could have fixed by just cooking for Riley herself.", "YTA. Your mom had every right to make that meal for you and you wife could have ordered something else for your kids.", "YTA.  Your mother, while you were her guests, offered solutions but you wouldn't have it.  Yourself, wife and child acted unbelievably entitled.  I would never invite you over either.", "YTA she\u2019s not a short order cook. She made it possible for your family to make other food and was ok with the kids not eating what she made. That\u2019s plenty gracious in my books.", "YTA.\n\nIf you have a family member who is a picky eater there are two things you can do so you don't burden anyone.\n\n1. Keep your Family at your own Home so that you can cater to whatever your Daughter wants.\n\n2. Bring your own food for your Daughter. Period.\n\nYour Mom is so right. Also OP, don't bother to contact your Mom anymore. Hopefully she'll forget she had an A H of a son and she can live the remaining years of her life happily without being stress with your *Family Issues*. \ud83d\ude44", "YTA. Few things that suck more than kids who are coddled to only eat white rice, chicken nuggets, and other similar bullshit. You're supposed to push your kids boundaries to expand them. Not accept every time they want to limit them.", "Yta", "YTA - your mother wanted to bond with her son and re-create probably what is a cherished memory for her.\n\nI get that you did not want to re-create this memory with her and instead you wanted her to start creating new memories that included your children. \n\nShe felt like you wanted her to act like a short order cook for your entire family.\n\nSince she is the host, it was up to you to have these conversations with her in advance and smooth things out. It\u2019s not feasible to show up at someone\u2019s house and start dictating how they cook. \n\nYour mother did not handle this properly, but I am choosing to not vote on her behavior, since she can\u2019t speak her side on this. Her saying that she does not like your daughter makes me think that there is a lot more going on in that dynamic than you have revealed (or perhaps aren\u2019t aware of.)", "YTA", "Yta your mom tried to be nice and make your favorite meal, and your wife was an ah about it. Then you became the ah when you decided to tell your mom you hate her bc she said your wife is entitled? Yes she is entitled", "YTA    you asked for the truth, and blew up when you got it.", "YTA and a horrible son. You owe your mom a massive apology. You were so incredibly rude to her. Your poor mother. \n\nAs others have pointed out, you are doing your daughter a massive disservice by catering to her so much. She\u2019s going to have times in her life when she won\u2019t have the option to eat exactly what she wants.", "YTA have fun knowing that this will probably be the last time you see your mom in person", "There may be a generational component here in that the idea that hosts are short order cooks for their guests is a more recent phenomenon. Growing up I was taught to eat what was served to me and be grateful for it. Then over the last 10-20 years it\u2019s become more and more acceptable for guests to dictate the menu. Sounds like mom way over reacted but ngl it\u2019s kind of a major pet peeve to a lot of people that still believe dinner guests should be thankful for the meal that was prepared and not expect that their special orders will be honored. \n\nThat said, *you* seem to have wildly over reacted as well and I think there\u2019s way more going in here than just food preferences and dining etiquette.\n\nESH", "I'm not old enough to have a grandchild, but I think that if the grandmother actually said that she can't stand the girl, then the girl is probably awful.  Maybe she's even bad enough to not want to invite her and her parents.\n\nYeah, the grandmother doesn't have to make separate dishes for the girl - it's not a restaurant.", "If you agree to eat at someone\u2019s house, there is always a chance you won\u2019t like what is served. As a picky eater, I always make sure that I have a snack in my purse just in case.\n\nThe obligations of the host are to attempt to make a crowd-pleasing meal, and not to push or pry too much if they see a guest not eating it. Your mom kind of failed on the first bit, but she made up for it by offering your wife the use of her kitchen.\n\nIt is not the obligation of the host to completely scrap their careful plan and make a new meal on the fly. Expecting someone to do that is entitled and bratty, and your mom had every right to be upset.\n\nSo everyone shares a bit of blame up to that point. Her for not asking about preferences before-hand, you for trying to get her to cook something else. \n\nBut where we really get into ESH territory is how you both overreacted and failed to communicate. Refusing to have you over again and not saying how hurt she was makes your mom an AH. Demanding an explanation and then blowing up when you got one makes you an AH. Both of you are drama queens who default to saying extremely hurtful things at the drop of a hat. \n\nESH", "ESH except the kids. Everyone needs to grow up. Arguments over food are beyond childish. Cook your kids something they'll eat.. It's not your mother's responsibility to cook a different meal for everyone's different likings.", "ESH. She made you guys a meal, and you didn't like it so she agreed to let you feed them something else, or the food without seasoning. Both of which are reasonable compromises, and in the end decided just not to cook because the people she was cooking for were ungrateful. I didn't even see a \"thanks for having us here\" just \"my kids won't eat that\" and demands.\n\nLike, you know Riley is a picky eater, pack her some nuggets.\n\nI wouldn't invite you back after you insisted I needed to change my entire meal plan because your kid is picky. Unless they have an actual allergy or neurodiversity being picky is a terrible reason to try to force your host to change their meal plans. \n\nYour mom wanted to cook something she knew you loved, and its unfortunate your family didn't like it but they had practical options including eating at home or fast food.\n\nShe should've asked if it was something the kids would eat, but I get the feeling your family involves a lot of beige foods.\n\nAs far as screaming at your mother; yeah honestly your teenage daughter probably is insufferable. All teenagers are. Its just how they are, and its not entirely your fault but I cant blame your mother for not wanting a 13 year old around who's disrespectful to her.\n\nBut seriously, screaming at her for something you guys caused? Saying you hate her? Learn to be graceful. I wonder if your teenage daughter has said similar things to her if this is how her grown son does.", "I'm going to say ESH - I think the response was a bit disproportionate but she was also being rude to your family and deserved an acknowledgement of her hurtful words", "ESH. Your mom should not have said she can\u2019t stand your daughter. Your reaction  (\u201cI hate you, have fun in the nursing home\u201d) may have been proportionate, but two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Your daughter, at 15, can make herself something or eat side dishes if she\u2019s too picky to eat the main course. And your wife shouldn\u2019t be \u201cconfronting\u201d a mother in law she sees once a year.\n\n  \nI\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess there\u2019s a whole lot more behind the scenes. I doubt anyone goes from a warm, close relationship to \u201cI hate you\u201c over a little blue cheese.", "ESH. Your mom sounds like a real treat, but your response was incredibly childish. If you can't have an adult conversation with her about your family's food issues and that she should just let you parents, you two probably shouldn't spend time together.", "If I was your mother a nursing home would be preferable. Your wife was rude, she could have made a meal for your daughter. Your mother isn\u2019t running a restaurant. She was trying to be nice. I hope your mother terminates all contact with you.

But how you talk about the whole situation, combined with what you said to her, makes me think there's a lot more to this story here.

I mean, you told her you hate her and have fun in a nursing home? \n\nThe only real victims in this situation are the children. The rest of you just sound insufferable.", "ESH - except Riley. My sister became vegetarian at the age of 10. No one in my extended had ever dealt with a vegetarian before. My mom always planned ahead so she would have something she could eat at family gatherings and not be a burden to the host.

It sounds like the situation over your favorite dinner should have been handled better by you and your wife, and you could have swallowed your pride a bit and said so, even if you thought you did everything correctly. Your mom sucks for holding a grudge for so long without acting like an adult and talking to you about it. She *really* sucks for trash-talking her grandchild. However, that doesn't excuse your emotional outburst at the end. Those never make things better, and you'll see that as time goes on. Hopefully you and your mother see the light and patch things up before too much time goes by. I made a similar outburst directed at my sister many years ago when I thought she was being disrespectful to my wife, and all I did was ruin my relationship with her for 2 years and make things worse for everyone.", "ESH but I get it.

Or has to have a work function that caters the food? Dinner parties held by friends later in life? There are so many other examples.\n\nI'm not saying this to attack you or Riley, so I do hope you don't feel the need to defend. This is only a comment for you to hopefully think about.\n\nBroadening her food variety will only benefit her in the long run. I say this as a person who cannot eat out unless there are vegetarian options, because the thought of gristle makes me physically ill. I'm not 'picky' per se, but my limitations have absolutely affected my life as an adult. I can eat meat I have prepared myself, but I can't eat at friends unless its vegetarian or fish. It's awkward and I miss out on a lot. People feel insulted. And explaining as an adult 'I'm picky about meat' does not alleviate the insult people feel when they've worked hard to make a meal, nor make it any less awkward.\n\nIf Riley doesn't have medical limitations, please help her avoid the future crap situations. Of course if something makes her feel gross or sick, don't force it. But general 'pickiness' and preferences only diets 100% affect adulthood."]}
