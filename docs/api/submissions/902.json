Long time reader first time poster. Probably had plenty of opportunities earlier. My girlfriend (36F) and I (37M) stay in a condo with a very generous older lady (~68F). We will call her LL for landlord. My g/f met her at a previous job, and LL has helped us essentially get back on our feet. We are not financially insecure. My g/f and I do both have jobs. LL presented us with the opportunity to live with her at a \"market discount\" ($300 a month vs the avg. $1100 for a studio) to save money. Amazing. We are essentially staying in the fully furnished guest bedroom.\nMy girlfriend is very messy. I used to be in the service for a long time and I am very, very dress right dress. I don't make the bed every day but I essentially follow her around like a rumba. Especially now that we live in someone's home. We share pantry / refrigerator space etc. Well, LL has a particular loveseat that is very well known to be hers. LL is super nice, btw. Like, if I'm sitting in it to tie my shoes or whatever, she'll be happy to sit on the couch. It's just her go-to. In September, my G/F sat down in the loveseat and it broke. My G/F is a big girl and when she sits, she plops. I feel like this is necessary to add because I feel like her and I have had this discussion before, sadly, and it could have been avoidable. We talked to LL about this chair and, very graciously, she said it's an older chair. So instead of us paying the whole thing, she will pay half. Super awesome! And, since my G/F had certain bills and OUR anniversary in October, LL said it can wait until November. My G/F and I are financially independent. I pay my half of the rent, vacations, etc. I told her I would commit $200 no matter how much the new loveseat costs because 1) I didn't break it and 2) I have repeatedly told her she was going to break it (it made very sad noises every time she plopped). She makes more money than I do. We talked about it tonight because I have been concerned LL missed her chair since it happened and she got super mad at me that I wouldn't commit to 25%. This particular loveseat now probably costs $1400 or so. I would like to encourage LL to pick any one she wants but I am refraining since I only committed $200. But I do not feel like that should matter since we are saving an extraordinary amount on rent AND it shouldn't be up to my G/F what LL picks out. I have since volunteered to go with LL to multiple furniture stores (She doesn't like to go to unfamiliar places alone) since I work nights, to try all these pieces she's been looking at online. Most of these pieces are less than what I would think she would want. I.E. she looked at a piece for $1200, $1000, and $800. In the event of the $800 piece, of course the $200 = 25%. But outside of that it doesn't. In addition, LL said to wit for Black Friday for a better deal. But my G/F is still throwing a temper tantrum that I am not committing more than $200.
