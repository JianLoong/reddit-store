We pretty much have everything taken care of at this point and everything planned amazingly. It's going to be a wedding of 100, and it's going to be a outdoor wedding. The venue is amazing, going to be barn type place and it's close and no one has to go on a road trip to get here.\n\nThe issue is yesterday, my sister (22F) and I were talking about my wedding and the conversation of her outfit came up. She was showing me on her phone the outfit she already bought that she's gonna wear to my wedding. It was a tuxedo. I asked her if she was seriously going to wear that, and she said yes. I told her calmly, that I would like for her to wear a different outfit and what she's planning on wearing is going to make everyone stare at her. She disagreed and said she think it'll be awesome and for me \"to not get mad if she wore it anyways at your wedding\"  the thing is, my finance's family are quite traditional, and I would rather not want my sister to argue with anyone at my wedding that could happen. After back and forthing with her I eventually told her to not come to my wedding. \n\nThis resulted in a huge argument between us both, and she kept telling me that I'm her sister and I should be okay with what anything she'd wear, and that the wedding shouldn't just be about the bride and groom. She eventually left, and has been ignoring me and the word got to my parents and my mom said to me that I should just let her wear the tux to my wedding, it's no big deal and it's harsh that I'd just straight up not allow her to show up. My fiance agrees with me, but now my sister and mom are pissed off at me.

I told her calmly, that I would like for her to wear a different outfit and what she's planning on wearing is going to make everyone stare at her. She disagreed and said she think it'll be awesome and for me \"to not get mad if she wore it anyways at your wedding\"  the thing is, my finance's family are quite traditional, and I would rather not want my sister to argue with anyone at my wedding. that could happen. After back and forthing with her I eventually told her to not come to my wedding. \n\nThis resulted in a huge argument between us both, and she kept telling me that I'm her sister and I should be okay with what anything she'd wear, and that the wedding shouldn't just be about the bride and groom. She eventually left, and has been ignoring me and the word got to my parents and my mom said to me that I should just let her wear the tux to my wedding, it's no big deal and it's harsh that I'd just straight up not allow her to show up.

OP just doesn't like it bc sister is female, I get the feeling that the \"traditional inlaws\" are an excuse, and even if they were OP's primary concern, it would still be shitty", "When was the last time you went to am outdoor wedding where guests wore tuxes?", "For the wedding party. Men usually wear suits.", "Right. She could come in a burlap sack for all I care, as long as it's not a white dress and she isn't in the wedding party wgaf?

Family are traditional in that they're bigots.", "Are there huge groups of society that adhere to strict dress codes in barns?? Maybe OP is marrying into a family of health and safety inspectors, and everyone will be wearing steel capped boots and hard hats in the barn, thus making an elegant tuxedo unsuitable?", "This is where I\u2019m at. Also the comment about the wedding \u201cnot just being about the bride and groom\u201d kind of threw me off. I think an appropriate compromise would be for Sister to just wear a normal suit (which is more appropriate for a day wedding anyway), and I do have to wonder why she didn\u2019t lead with that from the beginning. If OP would be okay with a suit, then she\u2019s NTA.", "I think OP would've made a point about it being too formal rather than it potentially starting a fight with a \"traditional\" family member if that were the case, don't you?", "I\u2019m not sure of that. OP didn\u2019t insist the sister wear a dress. Idk if the weddings I\u2019ve been to lately were unusual but no one outside the wedding party wore a tuxedo. That would stand out. Her sis could wear trousers a bow tie and a shirt but a full blown tuxedo seems like a showstopper and this ain\u2019t her show.", "Soooo op is more concerned about pleasing the type of people who would pick a fight about a woman wearing a tuxedo than her sister? \n\nYTA", "Traditional translates into bigoted. So we know who the aholes are!", "She said \u201cmy finance\u2019s family are quite traditional\u201d.  Really says it all right there.

If this the real conflict, absolutely YTA and doubly so for presenting the facts to us in bad faith.", "The right-wing family, sounds like it.", "*reich family.", "Absolutely, I was just being facetious. OP is without a doubt the AH here.", "I mean. If the groom is in a tux then perhaps his groomsmen are too? Also the point of tuxes is that they\u2019re all the same. Nobody is going to be upset if more than one person wears one.", "Sadly bigots really ***MUST*** be heard! /s (obviously)", "I care more about looks than when my sister comes to a wedding. By the way, if your in-laws are the kind of people who think it's their job to figure out what other people, especially the bride's sister, are wearing, they're assholes too. Then why do you care what your asshole thinks? Find out for yourself.", "That's what I was thinking. A nice suit is great, but wearing a tux when the groom and party will also wear tuxes, is like her wearing a brides maid's dress. It's weird.", "OP definitely would have said if it was a casual wedding, and her in-laws are \"traditional.\"", "Op justifies it with the groom's family being traditional and minding the tux. Something tells me it's not about the formality but rather about gender. Op is the ta along with the in-laws.", "If a dude wore a tux to a non black tie event, that would also be AH move", "I was just thinking the same thing -  It's actually ALL about the bride and groom. Assumptions and implications and judgments and guesses about why this is going to be a problem for everybody( grooms probably judgemtal ass family), no matter what way you look at it  her sister IS  going to stand out on her day. Not any different in a way than somebody wearing a white dress to a wedding and the bride being upset about that. I absolutely believe that people should be themselves, dress the  way they want, and be comfortable. But I also feel that sometimes we make consessions for people we love and respect.", "Agreed. Normally I think I'd be on the Reddit bandwagon that she's just dressing in a way that makes her comfortable or how she expresses herself (yada yada), but just something about the whole post makes it seem like the whole intention is for this to be an attention-seeking statement. OP's response, for example, makes it seem like it's a pretty out-of-character thing for the sister to wear in the first place.", "No worries, for I sure picked up that \u201cnot just about\u201d statement right away!", "Plus, it is also her wedding. This is the one day in forever that she gets to dictate how things go. If she wants everyone to wear dresses or neon freaking green, then so be it. It\u2019s HER day, not her sisters.", "Agree for the most part, but there are plenty of formal or semi formal options for pant suits for women that aren\u2019t a tux.\n\nBased on the sister\u2019s attention seeking comment, I don\u2019t think she wants to wear a tux becoming it\u2019s more comfortable, she just wants the attention.", "Ok, but a TUXEDO is not the comfort solution to a dress. A pantsuit? A jumper? Slacks and a blouse? It's at a barn ffs, wear jeans. The statement that it shouldn't be all about the bride and groom makes it sound like the sister is attention seeking.", "I have attended a black tie wedding in which the men were expected to wear tuxedos. Very dark suits with formal accessories were acceptable but not encouraged.\n\nI think it's a rich person thing since the bride and groom are millionaires.", "If that was the case, why would she specifically state that her reasoning was her fianc\u00e9s \u201ctraditional\u201d family? If it\u2019s the matter of appropriate attire for the event the bride and groom would have more of an issue than the grooms family. Not only that but \u201ctraditional\u201d families have traditional weddings, and if something as small as someone else\u2019s attire needs to be controlled for their sake, you can pretty much bet the rest of the wedding is based around their views. Where does it imply the sister is looking for attention? EVERYONE should be comfortable in what they wear as long as it fits to the occasion and that\u2019s not attention seeking because you have conservative weirdos trying to police other peoples choices. Her comment about the wedding isn\u2019t just about you was shitty but for all we know, the sister is actually non binary and doesn\u2019t wear dresses and shouldn\u2019t have to conform for the sake of those who\u2019d judge them.", "If the groomsmen aren\u2019t wearing tuxes because it\u2019s a casual wedding and ANYONE shows up in a tux, I\u2019d call that weird. We need more info!", "Agreed! The Op's vibe of surprise is pretty obvious and I wondered the same.", "Maybe lil sis is an influencer or a wannabe and thinks this is the kind of subject to generate numbers on Insta, Snatchad or whatever.", "I think what she means is its about family. Like generally yes the wedding is about the bride and groom but also their families. Ie: walking down the isle, wedding parties having siblings/cousins/uncles/aunts, mother/son father/daughter dance. Weddings are a uniting of two families. Its kinda absurd to think that your family isn\u2019t important on your wedding day since that\u2019s literally the symbolism of the event. \n\nI think the sister is thinking that. The day is for them and their *families* and op would rather abandon her family to appease his which is shitty behaviour.", "This is what gets me. If she wore a wedding dress everyone would be all up in arms, but a full tux and not in the wedding party still seems inappropriately formal to me. Definitely attention seeking for sure.", "Yes, given the traditional family comment, that was my guess too but I'm trying to be less pessimistic by giving OP the benefit of the doubt. Lack of response to anyone leads me more to believe troll through.", "You don\u2019t need to be NB to wear a suit/tux. A woman can wear one and have it be perfectly appropriate, however she must also wear it properly and follow the dress code.", "I was thinking the same. \n\nMy brother is about to marry a girl from a \u201ctraditional\u201d family. I haven\u2019t met all her family, but future SIL seems great and not super traditional. However, what I\u2019ve heard from my mom sounds like her family will have an interesting time with our family that drinks and loves to party. I\u2019m looking forward to making them uncomfortable honestly if they\u2019re gonna be rude and judge people. Lol \n\nThe difference is despite them being \u201ctraditional\u201d my brother and SIL haven\u2019t tried to tell anyone in our family what to do.", "Yeah, that was where my mind first went, as well. We're definitely being left in the dark about a lot of information. Does the sister usually wear gender non-conforming clothing or does the sister have a history of doing things against the grain to make herself stand out and the bride is tired of it? Is the bride reading the situation like the second situation, but the sister does the first, and just doesn't notice because formal wear tends to have no leniency between genders?\n\nBecause with the information we have now, sister seems very YTA to me...", "Wearing a tuxedo to an outdoor daytime burlap-and-mason-jars barn wedding would be tacky, unless the invite specifies black tie, in which case the whole wedding would be tacky. That's not why OP is making a stink about this though, rest assured.", "Formal wear for barn weddings is a bit tacky, just like cowboy boots and flannel at a formal wedding is a bit tacky. A prom dress in Harbor Freight looks just as odd as overalls and muck boots in a Neiman Marcus.", "Wearing a tuxedo in the daytime looks ridiculous, like you\u2019re a teenager having their prom photos taken. It\u2019s evening wear.", "Hard agree. Let sister wear a regular suit problem solved. Tux is tacky and attention seeking.", "OP won't clarify because they dissappear as soon as they are called the asshole", "Yeah even if the extreme traditionalists present don\u2019t like it, who would start an issue about a woman wearing pants in 2023 that OP wants to please?", "A tuxedo at that. Not just pants, she's still going to be  fancy AF.", "I mean I kind of thought when I read tux that it might be like upstaging the groom? So like, maybe a regular suit and not a tux would be more appropriate? But then came the bit about the in-laws. Of course.", "I swear I thought this was about a white dress.

Hot as hell.", "thanks for the new celeb crush and Gender", "I absolutely think homophobia comes into play, at least tangentially, because people who don't fit gender norms are usually perceived as gay even if they're not, but where does it say the sister is openly LGBT? I've read the post four times and don't see it. Did something get deleted?", "Correct. It doesn't. But OP seems worried her in laws will think her sisters clothes suggest she may be, even if she isn't.", "I had the same thought, and re-read the post to see if OP mentioned her sister being gay. I didn't see it.\n\nMy question would be, does she want to wear a tux because she is more comfortable dressed like that or is she going for the shock value?\n\nOne makes OP the A hole, the other makes the sister the A hole", "This is why i have noise canceling headphones.", "This right here. \u201cThey are very traditional\u201d also almost always implies they are sensitive babies who will throw a fit if they see something they don\u2019t agree with", "Yup, traditional is code for bigot.", "Agreed. It's not ok to wear white in case of upstaging the bride but it's OK to upstage and out formal the groom?
