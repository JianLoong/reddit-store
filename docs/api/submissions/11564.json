We pretty much have everything taken care of at this point and everything planned amazingly. It's going to be a wedding of 100, and it's going to be a outdoor wedding. The venue is amazing, going to be barn type place and it's close and no one has to go on a road trip to get here.\n\nThe issue is yesterday, my sister (22F) and I were talking about my wedding and the conversation of her outfit came up. She was showing me on her phone the outfit she already bought that she's gonna wear to my wedding. It was a tuxedo. I asked her if she was seriously going to wear that, and she said yes. I told her calmly, that I would like for her to wear a different outfit and what she's planning on wearing is going to make everyone stare at her. She disagreed and said she think it'll be awesome and for me \"to not get mad if she wore it anyways at your wedding\"  the thing is, my finance's family are quite traditional, and I would rather not want my sister to argue with anyone at my wedding that could happen. After back and forthing with her I eventually told her to not come to my wedding. \n\nThis resulted in a huge argument between us both, and she kept telling me that I'm her sister and I should be okay with what anything she'd wear, and that the wedding shouldn't just be about the bride and groom. She eventually left, and has been ignoring me and the word got to my parents and my mom said to me that I should just let her wear the tux to my wedding, it's no big deal and it's harsh that I'd just straight up not allow her to show up. My fiance agrees with me, but now my sister and mom are pissed off at me.

I told her calmly, that I would like for her to wear a different outfit and what she's planning on wearing is going to make everyone stare at her. She disagreed and said she think it'll be awesome and for me \"to not get mad if she wore it anyways at your wedding\"  the thing is, my finance's family are quite traditional, and I would rather not want my sister to argue with anyone at my wedding. that could happen. After back and forthing with her I eventually told her to not come to my wedding. \n\nThis resulted in a huge argument between us both, and she kept telling me that I'm her sister and I should be okay with what anything she'd wear, and that the wedding shouldn't just be about the bride and groom. She eventually left, and has been ignoring me and the word got to my parents and my mom said to me that I should just let her wear the tux to my wedding, it's no big deal and it's harsh that I'd just straight up not allow her to show up.

A tux could be a ridiculous choice for anyone depending on the \"vibe\" of an outdoor wedding. Are the groom/groomsmen wearing nice khakis, a dress shirt, and some oxfords? Is the bridal party wearing more casual sundress like outfits? Plus a tux would be HOT depending on the weather.\n\nButtttt, if it's just that the bride doesn't want her sister to wear \"men's clothes\" then YTA. And the tone of everything seems to point that way.", "This was my immediate first thought. Wearing a pantsuit or a jumpsuit to a wedding isn\u2019t odd at all!

It seems like you are the bigot in this scenario.", "My sister was not a part of my wedding party. We are very close but I didn't even consider it. I don't think it's that odd", ">and she kept telling me that I'm her sister and I should be okay with what anything she'd wear, and that the wedding shouldn't just be about the bride and groom. \n\nThat last bit though.

This is 100% about gender norms and/or identity. If the finances family is so \u201ctraditional\u201d, it\u2019s a formal wedding and if their the only ones who have a problem with a chick wearing a suit, it is very clearly about the fact the don\u2019t think women should wear them and would literally cause a fight at their kids wedding over someone else\u2019s attire that affects no one.", "I don't think that's the case, due to the mentions of her in laws being very \"traditional\".

There are lots of spectacular tuxedos with feminine cuts. Regardless, why does it matter what gender the tuxedo was designed for?", "Hey don\u2019t come for barns like that", "It\u2019s not going to upset OP, she just wants to cater to her queerphobic in-laws over her own sister. That\u2019s what makes it a problem.", "Given the level of shock described and not mentioning that sister prefers to be tomboyish, this sounds like she was expecting to see a dress like any other time sister shows her an outfit.", "But if the groom isn\u2019t wearing a tux, would it be right for a guest (regardless If they are Male or Female) to over dress the bridal party?", "A tux is something the groom wears and if he\u2019s not even wearing a tux then it\u2019s definitely too flashy to wear as a guest.

Because if it\u2019s because of the tuxedo clash with the \u201ctheme\u201d of the wedding i would think op is not the AH but if it\u2019s a gender expression and OP is being bigoted that is in a AH territory", "It's a huge leap to assume a golden child/scapegoat dynamic. Nothing in this story implies that's the case. \n\n\nThe sister doesn't want to wear feminine clothing, why should she be forced to? Yes, technically it's the bride's wedding and she's allowed to have \"her day\" however she wants. But this isn't am-i-technically-allowed, this is am-i-the-asshole, and uninviting your only(?)

It makes it seem like the sister is looking for ways to draw attention to herself and away from the bridal couple.", "That\u2019s a HUGE detail that OP left out. It\u2019s one thing if the sister is wanting to wear a tux purely to get attention or tongues wagging (or create chaos with the conservative in-laws).

Why can\u2019t the in-laws not act like monkeys at a tux if it\u2019s not their wedding?", "She's punishing her sister for what she anticipates will be bad behavior on the part of others.", "Yes, it seems like OP is concerned about the wrong person in this situation, worrying about an outfit her sister plans to wear instead of people who would willingly start trouble at her ceremony.", "I agree this is the implication but I'd like to see OP clarify it anyways...

I\u2019m hoping for the benefit of the doubt and that it\u2019s just totally inappropriate attire, but I see a lot of comments saying OPs family is too \u201ctraditional\u201d or that OP is maybe transphobic. I don\u2019t see actual evidence of that yet. My brother wore a white velvet suit and my (very little at the time) sibling wore and almost exact replica of my wedding dress. Hell yeah we had fun with our outfits at my wedding! I\u2019m always down for a big dose of weirdness at my events though.

I\u2019d be honored to have such fly-looking attendees at my wedding lol", "There are different types of modern tuxes, especially ones made for female frames.
