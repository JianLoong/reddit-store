Our 14 y/o has been having some issues with her behavior, since starting high school. After my wife and I\u2019s reaction to a recent situation, we have had conflict in the family with my siblings and parents.\n\nOur daughter, Gianna, is our youngest girl and third youngest overall. She is currently going to the same high school as her older siblings. We haven\u2019t had any issues with our older daughter or son, although they are in the same grade, as our older son skipped 2 grades when he was younger. Gianna, however, has had some issues with her behavior, mostly in terms of her being a bully.\n\nIt started in the first few weeks of school, where she got in trouble for making some bigoted remarks to a gay male student, When my wife and I heard about this, we were appalled and punished her, we also got her therapy. There have been other things that could be considered bullying, such as being mean to teachers and her siblings, which we have dealt with, but nothing against other students until now. \n\nAbout a week ago, we got a call from the kids\u2019s school telling us that Gianna and her friends were starting to be rude to her peers again, specifically to the boys that got her in trouble for picking on the gay boy earlier this year. \n\nLuckily, our nephew, my sister\u2019s son (14m) is in the same class as them, so we were able to get the full story of what happened, we were a bit worried he\u2019d sugarcoat it bc he\u2019s pretty close to Gianna but he didn\u2019t. \n\nOur kids\u2019s school allows kids to wear pajamas in school, they have a pretty lax dress code. The boys in the group were wearing pajamas, which makes sense bc it is very cold out rn. My daughter was mocking them, from calling them \u201cunclassy\u201d to saying they were \u201cchildish\u201d because some had baseball designs on them.\n\nI asked my nephew about the boys and he said that they\u2019re the sweetest guys, they\u2019re popular and athletes, and he said that they were telling her to stop acting like police to her and started laughing, and weren\u2019t too bugged, but my daughter and her friends kept trying to get more offensive in order to get a reaction, which disturbed class. \n\nAs the events of the past few days have unfolded, we have asked for her phone and saw her and her friends were bullying people both inside their school and people they met online. The school is investigating what else she did.\n\nMy wife and I told her if she does not apologize to the boys, promise to not bully again and makes up for her wrongs that she would not be allowed to have a phone or go on vacation with us over the summer, as well as having her transfer schools be considered. \n\nGianna has complained about this to my siblings and parents, and they have all said I am going too far, and that \u201cmean girls usually grow out of it\u201d and to let her naturally improve by therapy and internal motivation\u201d.

It sounds like you will only punish her if she does not  apologize and promise to not bully, but she's ALREADY done damage- she should have consequences for the actions she's already done.

It\u2019s a satisfying thing to do, but basing how we choose to pursue correcting behaviour on what pleases monkey brain emotions isn\u2019t what works \u2014 what works better is leading her to see the harm her behaviour causes, not just to the boys in question but to the wider school and her family, and then helping her correct that. \n\nIf she gets cut off from her positive influences as you suggest, or if they inflict greater punishment for the sake of revenge-justice, where\u2019s she going to turn to?

But what ends up happening, is all of those kids end up in the same place, all of them act out at the same time, and the quality of education plummets. \n\nYou're just putting in her into an environment where all of the kids in her environment are struggling, they are the \"rejects\" and it usually just feed off each other, it compounds and everyone spirals. \n \n\nI think that they should be pushing to try to include her in more extracurriculars. Try to get her involved in a sport etc. But usually when schools offer this as an option, it is for their own benefit not the students.", "because i felt like the OP has a legitimate issue and despite my lack of judgement on this i wanted to tell him that there's probably a better place to ask for advice", "[removed]", "I see your point, and I partly agree. Because it's been my stance all along.\n\nYou and the other poster who's replying to me haven't read OPs post or my responses properly at all.\n\nNobody is suggesting cutting her off from her family. Nowhere has that been mentioned.\nNobody is arguing for focusing on punishment for punishments sake.\n\nYou base your criticism of my stance on imagined extremes that have never been brought up.\n\nIt's one vacation that's in play here, something that is a luxury.\nTaking away a good thing as a response to a reprehensible action. That's an absolutely fair response, as it teaches her that her actions have consequences.\n\nAs you said, at her age she's very impressionable. Which is why it's important to be clear now that what she's doing is not right.\n\nTake a breather, mate, and read OPs post and my comments again.", "It doesn't sound like the school is trying to force it sounds like the parents are looking into it. As someone who's stepmom made them leave school, based on me getting detention which violated a contract she made me sign at 13, thinking another school will just have all the rejects is false. Unless the school is specifically an alternative school for bad kids it should just be another school of the same caliber but a new environment. OP has given her fair expectations to avoid this and if she chooses not to follow those then taking her out of that environment seems absolutely fair to me. Those friends are not helping her in the slightest it seems so why should she stay there and continue to be influenced?", "[removed]", "Actually I did scroll through that thread before responding, it\u2019s kind of why I responded.\n\nNow, I\u2019d like you to think about the opportunity the holiday actually presents for a few minutes. Don\u2019t just look at it in black and white reward vs punishment, let\u2019s nuance this. \n\nOP would have the troubled child effectively alone, away from her peers, if her phone is still confiscated then completely cut off from wherever the bad thoughts were coming from, in a low-stress environment.\n\nTo be sure I\u2019m not suggesting rewarding homophobia with Disneyworld or even anywhere particularly touristy, but where this comes from for me is that whenever my parents needed to have difficult conversations with me, usually over grades, it would be over dinner at my favourite restaurant or something. And those conversations were constructive because whatever the content was, it was against a backdrop of *we love you and this conversation doesn\u2019t change that*. \n\nA few days at a coastal town with a few family activities planned out would be a good, constructive backdrop to have a conversation about why she thinks what she thinks. Bonus: she can\u2019t storm off to her room because she doesn\u2019t like where the chat is going. \n\nCancelling the entire vacation punishes all four kids and the two parents for one girl\u2019s transgression and is sure to make her extra popular with her siblings. Taking everyone but trouble child excludes her from the family. Go ahead with the vaycay, there\u2019s a fantastic opportunity to bring her back while she\u2019s isolated from whomever it is giving her the homophobic ideas. She\u2019s still part of the family and feels included and will be more inclined to give consideration to the parental point of view. \n\nLike I said. Punishment is easy, but rehabilitation actually heals.", "Because she's experiencing the consequences for bad behavior where she's at. You're not teaching her how to solve problems. You're teaching her how to ignore them. \n\n>based on me getting detention which violated a contract she made me sign at 13\n\nJust for detention? One detention she pulled you from school?", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Well obviously you still haven't read OPs post properly.\nThey very clearly state that they won't be cancelling the vacation. They just won't let the 14 year old join this year.\n\nBit difficult to trust anything you say after that blunder, to be honest.\nI doubt you took a single thing I wrote in my last comment into consideration before you wrote essay #2.\n\nYou're also blowing this way out of proportion, as if this one vacation is the be-all and end-all of this girls life.\nYour pseudointellectual preaching is a bit obnoxious as well mate, tone the dramatics down a bit, yeah? It's a week or two, it's a fair response, and it's not the apocalypse.\n\nHer parents have obviously spoken to her, and will again in the future.", "Yes. The real reason is because she didn't want my Dad to pay for private school for me, she just needed an excuse. I got in trouble my freshman year for a fight a friend started (only fight i have ever been in in my life and the only touble i got into). The next year that group of friends was gone anyway but she still made me sign a contract that said if I got detention I would have to change schools and wait till I was 17 to get my license. Now I am 32 and have a 12 year old little sister and a 17 year old little brother who has done much worse than me and has had very little consequences in comparison but those are actually her kids so i shouldn't be surprised. \n\nThe point is friends have a lot of influence at this age and if the consequences are laid out clearly and she chooses not to follow them then she needs to get away from that influence.", "Oh an even worse is my actual detentions that year were for not buttoning my collar and for saying crap because I couldn't find a paper. Both were from a crazy religion teacher at my Catholic high-school. It was extremely unfair and I am still pretty resentful to be honest.", "[removed]", "So they\u2019re excluding the volatile 14yo from a family activity then? \n\nWould you care to refer back to my comment on why that\u2019s going to lead to an adverse result?\n\nOr would you rather project about pseudointellectual essay writing some more?", "I'm sorry that happened to you really.", "[removed]", "More extremes, more excuses, and more rationalising.\n\nYour previous comment was a jumbled mess of exaggerations wrapped in pseudointellectual vocabulary, mate, and you still dance around the fact that you got a lot of it wrong without taking accountability.\n\nThis isn't productive since you can't accept fault.\nIt could have gone well after your first comment, but it's a dumpsterfire of you deflecting left and right at this point.\n\nIf you're ready to get back on track, let me know.", "[removed]", "[removed]"]}
