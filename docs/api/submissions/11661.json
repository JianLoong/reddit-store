Our 14 y/o has been having some issues with her behavior, since starting high school. After my wife and I\u2019s reaction to a recent situation, we have had conflict in the family with my siblings and parents.\n\nOur daughter, Gianna, is our youngest girl and third youngest overall. She is currently going to the same high school as her older siblings. We haven\u2019t had any issues with our older daughter or son, although they are in the same grade, as our older son skipped 2 grades when he was younger. Gianna, however, has had some issues with her behavior, mostly in terms of her being a bully.\n\nIt started in the first few weeks of school, where she got in trouble for making some bigoted remarks to a gay male student, When my wife and I heard about this, we were appalled and punished her, we also got her therapy. There have been other things that could be considered bullying, such as being mean to teachers and her siblings, which we have dealt with, but nothing against other students until now. \n\nAbout a week ago, we got a call from the kids\u2019s school telling us that Gianna and her friends were starting to be rude to her peers again, specifically to the boys that got her in trouble for picking on the gay boy earlier this year. \n\nLuckily, our nephew, my sister\u2019s son (14m) is in the same class as them, so we were able to get the full story of what happened, we were a bit worried he\u2019d sugarcoat it bc he\u2019s pretty close to Gianna but he didn\u2019t. \n\nOur kids\u2019s school allows kids to wear pajamas in school, they have a pretty lax dress code. The boys in the group were wearing pajamas, which makes sense bc it is very cold out rn. My daughter was mocking them, from calling them \u201cunclassy\u201d to saying they were \u201cchildish\u201d because some had baseball designs on them.\n\nI asked my nephew about the boys and he said that they\u2019re the sweetest guys, they\u2019re popular and athletes, and he said that they were telling her to stop acting like police to her and started laughing, and weren\u2019t too bugged, but my daughter and her friends kept trying to get more offensive in order to get a reaction, which disturbed class. \n\nAs the events of the past few days have unfolded, we have asked for her phone and saw her and her friends were bullying people both inside their school and people they met online. The school is investigating what else she did.\n\nMy wife and I told her if she does not apologize to the boys, promise to not bully again and makes up for her wrongs that she would not be allowed to have a phone or go on vacation with us over the summer, as well as having her transfer schools be considered. \n\nGianna has complained about this to my siblings and parents, and they have all said I am going too far, and that \u201cmean girls usually grow out of it\u201d and to let her naturally improve by therapy and internal motivation\u201d.

Instead of basing her phone's return on a set of arbitrary actions that you've dictated, put the ball in her court.

It sounds like you will only punish her if she does not  apologize and promise to not bully, but she's ALREADY done damage- she should have consequences for the actions she's already done. Your daughter needs a wake up call as to what bullying another person can lead to- i'm not a parent, i'm not sure what the answer is there, but you should not listen to those family members saying \"mean girls usually grow out of it\".

Whether she apologizes or not, she\u2019s already done the bullying. She should face consequences for her actions regardless of whether or not she apologizes.

It's also reasonable to take other personal effects and privaleges that she thinks are valuable. \n\nBut exclusion from family bonding time is not an effective punishment, her social emotional intelligence is lacking, and she needs as much time interacting with others as possible. Removing her from a family vacation sends a clear message. \"You are not part of this family\", and that will encourage her to act out more. \n\nSometimes schools will require that students transfer, it should never be the parent's preference.

Sure, confiscate her phone if its used to bully but consequences need to be immediate and relevant to the situation. \n\nObviously she needs more guidance than she has gotten, so check in with her therapist, she can't keep escalating her behavior for attention (being disruptive and increasingly nasty when kids aren't bothered seems like attention seeking, like any attention is good attention, so she seems to need redirection.)", "NTA.

It\u2019s a satisfying thing to do, but basing how we choose to pursue correcting behaviour on what pleases monkey brain emotions isn\u2019t what works \u2014 what works better is leading her to see the harm her behaviour causes, not just to the boys in question but to the wider school and her family, and then helping her correct that. \n\nIf she gets cut off from her positive influences as you suggest, or if they inflict greater punishment for the sake of revenge-justice, where\u2019s she going to turn to?
