Are you going to give chunks of it out to the other kids? After all, you wouldn't want there to be resentment because your step-daughter got something and they didn't, right? \n\nAnd if your family, after finding out about your step-daughter's inheritance, called and said that she should fork over some of it over to make things fair, would you agree to it? Or would you say that they weren't related to her family, so they should get nothing?\n\nYou're disrespecting your cousin's wishes by doing this, you are being entitled, and you are teaching your step-daughter entitlement. You are demanding that your niece have less, so your step-daughter can have something, and you don't think that would cause resentment when she grows up and finds out? You want to take your niece's money from her, and your reasoning is that she's 5 and doesn't need it, as if that money can't be put away for when she does need it. \n\nI'm going to be honest, you're behaving like a vulture. Your cousin dies, and you don't think you've got your fair share of the meat, so you're trying to snatch it out of the mouths of others. Do you really think this is acceptable? If your brother passes first, will you demand his daughter hand over some of her inheritance to your step-daughter to make things fair? Because that is where your logic is taking you. \n\nYTA, and you owe your brother an apology. An inheritance is a privilege, not a right. You could have explained this to your step-daughter, pointed out lots of others weren't included, and told her that money doesn't equal love. Instead, you want to snatch money from your niece. Do better.", "YTA\n\nLike, a lot. This is incredibly bad form on your part. Your cousin chose who she wanted her estate to be divided amongst. Does it suck that your SD wasn't one of the people? Sure. That doesn't give you the right to demand that somebody give her a share of the inheritance. That's crude and gross.", "YTA - the money should be divided up how Laura indicated, that\u2019s how a will works. I assume Laura had her reasons for structuring her estate as such.", "YTA\n\nNow is not the time to start a fight about how the family treats your stepdaughter. \n\nYour cousin's will is her will and it says what is says.

Laura didn\u2019t leave your step daughter any money.  That\u2019s a fact no matter what happens now. You want your brother to steal from his child to make your child feel better.

If your SD would feel better if someone gave her money, then give her some of yours.", "I assume the other children were named and your SD was not. That's sadly how it works with step-children.

I'm shocked this needs to even be explained.", "Wait...\n\nYour cousin had a will made up giving everything to her husband and future kids? And \"if not\" then the estate would be divided between her parents, charity, and cousins kids?\n\nSo I'm assuming that she had a husband when she wrote the will, because no lawyer or notary  in their right mind would write up a document that included speculative people.   Hell, even the \"future kids\" part is suspect, in that modifying a will to include children is easily done when one gets pregnant.   \n\nYTA for manufacturing this post.", "YTA and the whole my kid could use it more excuse is just disgusting. Provide for your step daughter and shut up.", "YTA. As much as you may dislike it, your SD was not biologically Laura's niece and therefore, as per the will, does not have an entitlement to the inheritance. To ask your brother to give a portion of his daughter's share of the inheritance to your SD leaves his daughter with less than her 5 other cousins when they all should have received an equal share. It doesn't matter if his daughter is 5, you would be disadvantaging her. \n\nI understand that maybe you/your SD sees receiving an inheritance = being accepted as part of the family but maybe this is an opportunity for you to enforce to her that that isn't the case, it's just how the law works and she's loved either way. Otherwise this is only going to drive your family away from her which seems to be the opposite of what you want.", "YTA\n\nOf course she left everything to her husband and children. Unless the inheritance is telephone numbers $/\u00a3/\u20ac it's normal almost everything will go to the partner and any children.", "YTA.", "YTA. If your SD got inheritance from her father or mother's side of the family, would your first thought be she should share it w/ your niece?\n\nYou can't force familial relationships where they don't exist. Blended families are complex and the older the child is when you bring them into a relationship, the less likely they are going to be seen as equal family to kids that were part of the family since birth. That is just reality. It depends on the family, how often you are together, what the overallbfamily bonds are like, the relationship with your wife, etc. - so many factors. As long as they don't make her feel un-welcome and are kind and considerate to her, the rest is all about real bonding.\n\nYou are being greedy.\n\nI am a step-daughter and I never would have even considered, let alone expected, my step father's parents or siblings to include me in their wills.", "YTA.    Reddit is filled with people wondering why step-family members are not included in inheritance.   It blows my mind.  \n\nInheritance isn\u2019t even considered MARITAL property in many countries (as long as kept separate).    Your SD has no claim to this money.   Yes it is disappointing, but life isn\u2019t fair.   She\u2019s not related.   She has another side of her blood relatives.   Maybe she won\u2019t get any inheritance from them, but those are the breaks.", "God inheritances bring out the worst in people, including people not even in the damn will", "YTA, I never understood being pissy at inheritance your kid doesn't get, I didn't get much inheritance when my half sister passed away suddenly, I didn't get pissy and I didn't resent others that got more than me (it was also logical), I was 16yo at the time ffs, if a 16yo kid can understand that, I don't understand how all the \"Responsible adults/grown ups\" can't wrap their heads around the fact when inheritance is given, it's done and done, stop begging for money from the deads to other family members, it's plain disrespectful", "YTA. You are the reason there is conflict in the family.  Not sure why you think your stepdaughter should even be considered\u2026..unless she was close to your cousin but that\u2019s not likely since she was not included in the Will.", "YTA for several reasons.\n\nFirst, noone is entitled to an inheritance.  I think others have covered that part well.\n\nSecond, you mention your step daughter, not your adopted child.  You likely play a fatherly role, but she is your spouse's child, not your daughter.  It would be nice if your family treated her the same, but the reality is your daughter has a different father - it is not the same.\n\nThird, why would your 5 year old step daughter grow up to resent her 10 year older step cousin, unless you carefully nurture the grudge.  She's 5, she has no idea of inheritance laws, and the idea that she was slighted by a second cousin she likely barely remembers won't occur to her unless you drill it in.", "YTA, because Laura wrote her will and that\u2019s what she wanted.

Did OP and Laura have a bad relationship that OP isnt mentioning?\n\ni understand frustration if the family on a regular basis is not treating the SD fairly and like family, but OP should not be entitled to anything.\n\nid be shocked if any of my moms cousins or even her siblings even named me in their wills.  just like how idk if my parents would leave anything to my cousins. idk maybe we just arent a super close family, but i dont think people should ever assume they are getting any portion of a persons estate.\n\nedit: also adding that this year my grandma died and left me and the other grandkids some money. my sister is in a MUCH better financial situation (she has a great job , been working for years, and lives with her bf who also has a good job, while i just graduated college and am trying to start my career) even though the money would be \"more useful for me in the near future\" I would **NEVER** ask her for a portion of it.", "It also doesn\u2019t matter how old the kids are. Just because the niece is 5 doesn\u2019t mean she can have the money taken from her savings and given to the unrelated step daughter.", "I'm also pretty sure OP is asking the brother to commit fraud (or some other illegal action?). That money was left \\*to his 6 year old daughter\\* who won't have access to it until she's 18. Even if the brother is executor of that account and can access the money now, he would be stealing from his daughter before she's old enough to legally take control of the money. OP is massively TA in this situation.", "YTA OP. While you may see your step daughter as family, your cousin did not and it sounds like you just destroyed any chance of your brother seeing her as such. Nothing says assh\\*le more the coming around demanding money after someone dies.", "YTA Why would someone assume that their step mother's cousin would leave them money? Your stepdaughter would only suffer harm if you suggested that she should.", "YTA.\n\nAnd why would the step-daughter get anything \u2018more useful in the near future\u2019 if she is 5?  Won\u2019t it be held in trust until she is of age?\n\nSeems like \u2018I wanted a nice holiday with the money\u2019 whinge more than concern for her step-daughter.", "The way I see it, the pandemic has separated families for two to three years. Unless OP got together with her partner pre pandemic and the partner had full custody of step daughter, I can see how difficult it might\u2019ve been for a distant relative to form a bond with step daughter. Couple that with the fact that they probably didn\u2019t interact much outside of video chats, phone calls, or maybe a socially distanced visit during the pandemic. I find it unlikely that the cousin was able to sustain a bond at the end of her life. While it\u2019s a kind thing to acknowledge a step child in a will, it\u2019s not mandatory. Expecting, let alone demanding that a step child be included in a distant relative\u2019s will is just straight up disrespectful and inappropriate.\n\nAll of this isn\u2019t to say that step children aren\u2019t \u201creal\u201d family members. It doesn\u2019t make them less legitimate in terms of including them at family functions. I agree with you. OP needs to back tf off and respect the cousin\u2019s last wishes.", "Agree with TA part but it makes NO difference how long Laura knew SD or how long marriage was. Laura alone decides who to leave any inheritance (her money) to and owes no one any explanation for her decision.\nNo one is entitled to a inheritance regardless of relationship with deceased person. Period.", "Agreed with everything except the word nibblings", "Yup. I guess blood ties matter to her when convenient.  Fact is that cousin's will sounds quite specific and its not OP's right to demand things from people who've received their rightful share based on cousin's decisions.", "You'd be surprised how some people change when they think that there's a substantial sum of money involved.  \n\n\nWhen my great-uncle died in the 1990s, a couple of his nieces were worried about the cost of the funeral. (I just reckoned that we'd have to split it among us - we're a big extended family.)  \n\n\nA bank book was found. A niece's husband and I were delegated to go see the bank manager, to check whether there was enough money to bury the old man. (NB I was probably the only member of my generation who saw G-U on a regular basis.)  \n\n\nThe Bank Manager looked at the passbook. Frowned. 'Will you give me a moment? I need to phone Head Office in Edinburgh.'  \n\n\nIt turned out that G-Uncle had another bank account with more than 20k in it - a substantial amount in those days.   \n\n\nIf you had seen how his nieces behaved once they were told...You'd think a bunch of locusts had gone through the house, desperately trying to find a will.  The house had all Great-Granny's furniture, photos and papers in it. I had to stop them from tearing up family birth certificates, death certificates, photos...Lair papers \\[Burial plot papers\\].  One of them was in a real panic: \"Oh, Uncle always said he was going to leave everything to \\[her daughter\\] and PurpleAquilegia...Oh, oh...but we've always shared everything in this family...\"  \n\n\nG-U died intestate. Inheritance tax was paid and the money was shared equally amongst his nieces and nephews (or their children if they'd died). I can't recall the exact number now, but I think that G-U had about 10 siblings - many of them had left Scotland. Suddenly, people who hadn't seen him in years were interested.", "Did the step-daughter even know or care about the inheritance without OP's involvement?  How and why would she even know if the person who gave the inheritance was a cousin to step-mom and the closest recipient is step-mom's niece?    I guarantee that OP is the one that made it a thing and is telling her step-daughter that it's unfair.  She's at fault if the kids end up with resentment issues.", "I guess it would depend on the relationship if it ended up being a bit of a snub or not.\nLike if step daughter was in the family since childhood and considered OP her only mother figure. \n\nIn that case it's hurtful for SD to be left out but still kind of up to cousin if SHE saw her as close family or not.\n\nBut in this case it seems step daughter has been in the family 3 years as a teen, and presumably has her own mother and doesn't think OP is her mom so wouldn't have a reason to feel like she's getting inheritance from step mom's side. This is a teenager who cousin presumably didn't know as well as the kids in the family she's known since birth.\n\nEither way a will is a will. If OP was referring to her as daughter not step daughter and she was practically family just not blood, and she was excluded for something like, say, racism, or homophobia, I'd say OP you go girl, and stand up her her right but this is not that.", "It all depends on the inheritance laws in the OP's country. I note that she says 'stepdaughter' rather than 'adopted daughter'. Legally the stepdaughter will be entitled to nothing.   \n\n\nI had a great-uncle who died intestate in Scotland. All his siblings had died, so (under Scots law)  his money was divided evenly amongst  the next generation - his nephews and nieces. Where they had died, their portion was then divided amongst their offspring.  (One nephew had gone NC with great-uncle - and some nieces had never met him - my great-grandparents had a big family, great-uncle was the youngest child and his older siblings had children and grandchildren in Scotland, England, Canada...)  \n\n\nOne family member couldn't be traced - one of my mum's cousins had adopted a daughter. It was one of those cases where the solicitors placed ads in national newspapers in an attempt to find her. Her share is still sitting in a bank account, waiting for her to claim. (It's been a while now, so perhaps it's gone to the state: I'm not sure what the cut-off date is.)", "Is your stepdaughter's mother involved in her life?\n\nIf so, she's someone else's daughter and will inherit from her.\n\nIf not, consider adopting your step daughter.\n\nNeither situation has any effect on your cousin's will.\n\nPS, it's offensive that you would ask *only* your niece to go with less. If you were brazen enough to go this route, you might as well have also asked all of your cousin's niblings on her husband's side.\n\nYTA", "I had this question as well, and I think this answer pushes me to YTA. If your SD had been in the picture for most of her life and you were essentially her parent (especially if you had adopted her), I can understand being miffed at the exclusion, though you still shouldn\u2019t demand a cut of someone else\u2019s share. But in fact, SD wasn\u2019t even family until she was already a teenager. Unless Laura and SD had developed a very close relationship in a short time, and it doesn\u2019t sound like they had, you really shouldn\u2019t be surprised she was left out of the will. This isn\u2019t just a \u201cblood\u201d thing\u2014if she saw SD as family at all, it was still a pretty recent development, and not the same kind of relationship as with someone who grew up in the family. Sorry, but YTA.\n\nI am sorry for your loss, though.", "Then she she could have included SD if she wanted...Why would  there be resentment? Unless you make a big deal about it?", "So they knew eachother and you still have the audacity to ask your brother to give his daughter inheritance when Laura didn\u2019t put her in it\uff1fimagine being this dumb lol Laura didn\u2019t want to put her and that\u2019s final if tou want your sd to have some extra money you and your husband should work or tell her to start working and saving money Laura didn\u2019t own her anything and the inheritance is not yours to decide", "Or the money is spent on things (e.g. college tuition, books, a car) that OP would have to pay for otherwise.", "Stop embarrassing yourself and sit down dude. I hope your family go NC over this incident", "Exactly. And the SD isn't Laura's family so wouldn't be eligible.  If Laura had meant to include your SD that would need to be in the will.", "Laura did not consider your spouse\u2019s child to be her niece. It was her money. She gets to decide who gets it.\n\nYour brother and his daughter owe you nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter if you want the money more or if you think your step child deserves it more.", "If you read my comment, I'm not saying that OP should push for this now. But come on: if OP had a biological kid that was 3 at the time of cousin's passing, would you justify leaving them out of the will because \"cousin only knew them for 3 years\"?", "yea, i get it. i come from a small family so the grandkids on my dads side only include, me, my sister, and two of the uncles kids. my two cousins (particularly one of them) is estranged from the family. My uncles ex wife is a looney who has done everything to turn the children against their dad. its like wild and crazy family drama that i wont get into right now, but for some reason the one cousin started blaming my grandma for the divorce that happened YEARS ago. (shes also like late 20s/early 30s not a child as it may sound like). she shit talk my grandma so much which idk i might be biased but she was like genuinely the sweetest lady ever. \n\nthey both showed up to the funeral and made quite a show sobbing in the back row, despite saying bad things about her like days before and DIRECTLY after the service but of course they are more than willing to take her money.", "This right here", "Her husband didn't survive.", ">  if OP had a biological kid that was 3 at the time of cousin's passing, would you justify leaving them out of the will because \"cousin only knew them for 3 years\"?\n\nThat would be a nibling.\n\nOP getting married to a person with a teen whose entire relationship with this cousin seemed to be that they had met.  Not a nibling.\n\nThere's no \"but come on\" here.  Cousin had 3 years of SD being in her life to change her will and didn't.  If cousin's loss was soooooo devastating, why aren't her final wishes being respected?", "There's no indication here that the other niblings had a closer relationship with cousin. If you're going to go by relationship on paper (e.g.: all niblings get the same amount), then leaving out non-biological relatives is nothing but prejudice. If it had been \"cousin chose her favorite niece who was like a daughter to her as an heir\", then sure, it makes sense for her to be left out. \n\nAs for \"respecting her final wishes\" - I'm not sure where in my previous comments you're reading that the will should be disregarded or OPs request was ok to make. All I'm saying is making the will in this way was an AH move.", "> the other niblings \n\nThey were niblings.  OP's SD was not.  There doesn't need to be any more to it than that.\n\n> then leaving out non-biological relatives is nothing but prejudice. \n\nNo kidding.  People are allowed to consider whomever they want to be family for whatever reason.  In the 3 years cousin \"knew\" OP's SD, she apparently never considered her \"family\" enough to leave a portion of her estate.  There's nothing assholey about that.\n\n > All I'm saying is making the will in this way was an AH move.\n\nIt wasn't.  Just because OP's SD became a part of OP's family doesn't make her part of cousin's \"family.\""]}
