Are you going to give chunks of it out to the other kids? After all, you wouldn't want there to be resentment because your step-daughter got something and they didn't, right? \n\nAnd if your family, after finding out about your step-daughter's inheritance, called and said that she should fork over some of it over to make things fair, would you agree to it? Or would you say that they weren't related to her family, so they should get nothing?\n\nYou're disrespecting your cousin's wishes by doing this, you are being entitled, and you are teaching your step-daughter entitlement. You are demanding that your niece have less, so your step-daughter can have something, and you don't think that would cause resentment when she grows up and finds out? You want to take your niece's money from her, and your reasoning is that she's 5 and doesn't need it, as if that money can't be put away for when she does need it. \n\nI'm going to be honest, you're behaving like a vulture. Your cousin dies, and you don't think you've got your fair share of the meat, so you're trying to snatch it out of the mouths of others. Do you really think this is acceptable? If your brother passes first, will you demand his daughter hand over some of her inheritance to your step-daughter to make things fair? Because that is where your logic is taking you. \n\nYTA, and you owe your brother an apology. An inheritance is a privilege, not a right. You could have explained this to your step-daughter, pointed out lots of others weren't included, and told her that money doesn't equal love. Instead, you want to snatch money from your niece. Do better.", "YTA\n\nLike, a lot. This is incredibly bad form on your part. Your cousin chose who she wanted her estate to be divided amongst. Does it suck that your SD wasn't one of the people? Sure. That doesn't give you the right to demand that somebody give her a share of the inheritance. That's crude and gross.", "YTA - the money should be divided up how Laura indicated, that\u2019s how a will works. I assume Laura had her reasons for structuring her estate as such.", "YTA\n\nNow is not the time to start a fight about how the family treats your stepdaughter. \n\nYour cousin's will is her will and it says what is says. Respect it. \n\nWhat will cause resentment is you starting fights over someone else's money.", "YTA. the fact that i have to explain this is embarrassing. you should respect your late relatives wishes on how it is supposed to be split. if it wasnt not meant to be shared like that, then leave it. stop acting like youre entitled to it\u2026jesus", "YTA \n\nNot only are you greedy, but you're entitled.\n\nNobody is entitled to someone else's money.

Laura didn\u2019t leave your step daughter any money.  That\u2019s a fact no matter what happens now. You want your brother to steal from his child to make your child feel better. That\u2019s just wrong, & your excuse that she\u2019s only 5 so your SD needs it more is just gross. No one is owed an inheritance. If your SD would feel better if someone gave her money, then give her some of yours.", "I assume the other children were named and your SD was not. That's sadly how it works with step-children. They get inheritances from their blood family but not always elsewhere. \nThat being said, your cousin made a will and that's that. Your brother is right to say no.

I'm shocked this needs to even be explained.", "Wait...\n\nYour cousin had a will made up giving everything to her husband and future kids? And \"if not\" then the estate would be divided between her parents, charity, and cousins kids?\n\nSo I'm assuming that she had a husband when she wrote the will, because no lawyer or notary  in their right mind would write up a document that included speculative people.   Hell, even the \"future kids\" part is suspect, in that modifying a will to include children is easily done when one gets pregnant.   \n\nYTA for manufacturing this post.", "YTA and the whole my kid could use it more excuse is just disgusting. Provide for your step daughter and shut up.", "YTA. As much as you may dislike it, your SD was not biologically Laura's niece and therefore, as per the will, does not have an entitlement to the inheritance. To ask your brother to give a portion of his daughter's share of the inheritance to your SD leaves his daughter with less than her 5 other cousins when they all should have received an equal share. It doesn't matter if his daughter is 5, you would be disadvantaging her. \n\nI understand that maybe you/your SD sees receiving an inheritance = being accepted as part of the family but maybe this is an opportunity for you to enforce to her that that isn't the case, it's just how the law works and she's loved either way. Otherwise this is only going to drive your family away from her which seems to be the opposite of what you want.", "YTA\n\nOf course she left everything to her husband and children. Unless the inheritance is telephone numbers $/\u00a3/\u20ac it's normal almost everything will go to the partner and any children.", "YTA.", "YTA. If your SD got inheritance from her father or mother's side of the family, would your first thought be she should share it w/ your niece?\n\nYou can't force familial relationships where they don't exist. Blended families are complex and the older the child is when you bring them into a relationship, the less likely they are going to be seen as equal family to kids that were part of the family since birth. That is just reality. It depends on the family, how often you are together, what the overallbfamily bonds are like, the relationship with your wife, etc. - so many factors. As long as they don't make her feel un-welcome and are kind and considerate to her, the rest is all about real bonding.\n\nYou are being greedy.\n\nI am a step-daughter and I never would have even considered, let alone expected, my step father's parents or siblings to include me in their wills.", "YTA.    Reddit is filled with people wondering why step-family members are not included in inheritance.   It blows my mind.  \n\nInheritance isn\u2019t even considered MARITAL property in many countries (as long as kept separate).    Your SD has no claim to this money.   Yes it is disappointing, but life isn\u2019t fair.   She\u2019s not related.   She has another side of her blood relatives.   Maybe she won\u2019t get any inheritance from them, but those are the breaks.", "God inheritances bring out the worst in people, including people not even in the damn will", "YTA, I never understood being pissy at inheritance your kid doesn't get, I didn't get much inheritance when my half sister passed away suddenly, I didn't get pissy and I didn't resent others that got more than me (it was also logical), I was 16yo at the time ffs, if a 16yo kid can understand that, I don't understand how all the \"Responsible adults/grown ups\" can't wrap their heads around the fact when inheritance is given, it's done and done, stop begging for money from the deads to other family members, it's plain disrespectful", "YTA. You are the reason there is conflict in the family.  Not sure why you think your stepdaughter should even be considered\u2026..unless she was close to your cousin but that\u2019s not likely since she was not included in the Will.", "YTA for several reasons.\n\nFirst, noone is entitled to an inheritance.  I think others have covered that part well.\n\nSecond, you mention your step daughter, not your adopted child.  You likely play a fatherly role, but she is your spouse's child, not your daughter.  It would be nice if your family treated her the same, but the reality is your daughter has a different father - it is not the same.\n\nThird, why would your 5 year old step daughter grow up to resent her 10 year older step cousin, unless you carefully nurture the grudge.  She's 5, she has no idea of inheritance laws, and the idea that she was slighted by a second cousin she likely barely remembers won't occur to her unless you drill it in.", "YTA, because Laura wrote her will and that\u2019s what she wanted.

Using that reasoning is abhorrent because she is 16 and your niece is 5. Neither have any control of how the family views them and the ties between them. Your niece has no control over the money and when she is older and can touch it, your SD shouldn't be asking. It's not hers. Point is, if Laura wanted her to have some, she would. There is a good chance my younger siblings will inherit something from their grandparents who are not mine and I won't, but my parents would never ask them to give it to me and I wouldn't ask them because it belongs to them.

You mentioned how the children can touch it when they are 18 so this kind makes you a bigger AH because you are asking for money that isn't yours or your brother's.

This is the most absurd thing I\u2019ve ever read. The 5 year old has no concept of what is going on right now nor does she have any power to alter it.

It sucks, but that's how it is. \n\n\nYou can't expect anyone to put someone else's kids before theirs. But, I know my brother in law's would put aside money for my kids even if they weren't left in the will. Its just the way they are and they have a good relationship with my and my husband's kids.\n\n(Edit formating)", "YTA. Your cousin decided how to split the money, accept her wishes.\nI can understand why she'd feel hurt though. My family is very close, and we accept step children and adopted children as our own and love them just as much as those with blood ties. My mom and dad married when I was 4 and my sister was 12, and my sister and I have never been treated differently. It's sad to see how many people don't view step children as being part of the family. But dealing with an inheritance is NOT the time to be pushing family relationships like that. What you SHOULD be doing to prevent future resentment is finding ways to foster a deeper connection between your DAUGHTER and the rest of your family. I promise you that a loving relationship will go much farther than money ever will. If you only seem to care if she's considered family is when money involved that just shows that you're greedy. \nPlan family meals. Go on adventures together as a family. Refer to her as your daughter without the step. Don't worry about money, worry about connection. If they see her as a family member then they'll treat her like one. And do NOT teach her that she's entitled to anyone's money, family or not. She shouldn't have even known about the inheritance", "YTA.  The money was left by your cousin to be split a certain way which does NOT include your stepdaughter.  \nYou have no business correcting her wishes not demanding your step daughter get money that is willed to other people. \n\nYou are being greedy.  Your step daughter is a STEP.  Like it or not.  Regardless the will was drawn to only include blood relatives. Life works that way.", "YTA - Unless there was a caveat for your step daughter in the will, you\u2019re the asshole.", "YTA. It was your cousins right to leave her money as she saw fit. If she didn't consider your stepdaughter to be her niece, she doesn't owe her a damn thing. Yes, blood ties are important to some people, that is not a bad thing. You can't demand your family love your stepdaughter, you can only hope they do.", "YtA", "YTA. This is a cash grab on your part and nothing more. If resentment builds it\u2019s bc you didn\u2019t use this opportunity as a teachable moment about being happy for others and not being entitled. It\u2019s clear why she wasn\u2019t included and it wasn\u2019t malicious at all.", "This is incredibly disrespectful of your cousin\u2019s last wishes. \n\nYTA", "I have a step daughter and although I've made it very clear to my family she is to be treated just like the rest of the children as I've been in her life since she was 2 and she's now 10 but in saying that I have absolutely no say in any inheritance money and who is goes to and I'm big on respecting people's last wishes.", "YTA. If your cousin wanted to share HER money in HER will, she would have.  My step sister called me the day after we buried my grandfather (she did not deign to show for the funeral) and asked if he left any money for her.  Gross.  It was 15 years ago and I still need to shower my soul when I think about it.", "YTA your cousin's will should be honoured. Don't be so grabby.", "YTA and it will only cause resentment from your SD if you decide to make it cause resentment.", "YTA. Did you read a bunch of AITA stories where the OP is the person some obnoxious relative is imposing on to get part of an inheritance they're not entitled to and flip the story to see the results?", "YTA. The will decease was clear in their will who they wanted the money to go to. Now you see money and want a cut you are not entitled to. \n\nDefinitely YTA.", "You are one stupid idiot ahahaha\n\nWhy tf would you give non direct family any inheritance? \n\nWhy don't you share your salary to be more fair?", "Not to mention this could be a great learning opportunity for the SD to realize life isn't fair but we can't pout about it. Learn some coping skills and carry on with life.", "Ooh, nice invocation of the Uno Reverse Analogy there!", "Hey now, that's just rude.\n\nVultures play a very important role in the ecosystem, like natural janitors.", "Laura probably just never saw the SD as a true nibbling because she is a stepdaughter unlike the 5 year old blood related niece. \n\nIf OP divorces odds are great the family and thus Laura will/would have never seen SD ever again. Unlike the brother's daughter who will always be his daughter and will have always been Laura's niece.\n\nNot to mention that the SD has two bio sides to inherit from and it's highly unlikely the SD is going to return the favor and include her step cousins in her inheritances.", "Especially people not in the damned will tbh.", "Wondering the same. Tf is a nibling? OP is an AH for using that word", "Nieces and nephews basically. Laura was pretty generous to extend it out to cousin\u2019s kids to begin with. OP\u2019s probably the only person who thinks your kids have a right to inherit from\nYour cousin.", "I apologise. I was obviously just comparing their habits of getting grabby over food to OP's inheritance-snatching. In every other way, the vultures are better behaved  and mannered, as well as serving a vital purpose. \n\nCome to think of it, I doubt a vulture would snatch food out of the mouth of a chick either, so perhaps my analogy could do with some rethinking.", "So, your cousin, her husband and their unborn baby are dead and you're worried about your SD getting no inheritance? You're an oozing, gaping, greedy, heartless fucking asshole. Your SD would be her second step-cousin. In other words, I'm as related to your cousin as your SD is. I guess I should call your brother and see if he wants to split it with me too.", "Ugh you're gross", "[removed]", "So it\u2019s not just her cousin that died.. it was her, her husband, and their unborn child. And she\u2019s concerned about their money. Sick.", "Right? There's no reason for a teenager to be looped in on the will of her stepparent's cousin.", "I have a feeling that op is not as close with SD as she wants to be.... and is doing this to get in the good graces of SD via money that HER FAMILY inheritance got to her SD", "YTA: my former step mom wanted my grandmother\u2019s jewelry to be divided between myself and her daughter. My grandma said no, and it caused a lot of problems. My dad and step mom ended up divorcing a few years later, which is exactly why I wouldn\u2019t \u201csplit\u201d my inheritance. \n\nI am glad you love your SD so fiercely; but demanding a portion of the inheritance for her is out of line.", "Just clearly state that you want some of the money, don't use your SD", "NTA. Your entitlement is disgusting.  Guess who won't be in her brother's will.", "We just redid our trust to cover some changes in our lives.  If the money moves on to niblings after our generation, I specifically named which niblings because I intend the money to go to those specific people.  You don't get to rewrite someone's will.  Your brother did not do this and did nothing bad to your stepdaughter.  \n\nAlso, the money belongs to your 6-year-old niece and your brother does not have the right to give it to you.  So you are asking him to commit a crime, dude.", "YTA. Laura\u2019s will didn\u2019t include step daughter. That\u2019s it.", "YTA. And anyone on your side is also the asshole.", "YTA - who are you to question your late cousin's wishes?  Very out of line for you to make a tough situation even tougher.  Your step daughter is entitled to nothing in this situation and you should be careful to not let this type of attitude rub off on her.", "YTA, your cousin decided who to leave their money to, don't go trying to guilt those people into giving you money, it isn't yours, it isn't your SD, and it is greedy and self serving to try and guilt your brother.", "YTA, you are coming from a right place but are clearly in the wrong here. Your cousin made the will and it is what it is. Apologize to your brother and move on.", "I mean, it\u2019s fair to ask, but any more than that is AH territory.  I get why.  College is coming and yeah, I\u2019m begging for money from anywhere to help with that.  But in the end, it wasn\u2019t her wishes and the money is not yours.", "Sorry, info - why can\u2019t YOU share YOUR part with your SD? Why is your brother responsible for her?\n\nAbsolute YTA.", "How much money are we talking about? That would sway my opinion for sure.", "Yeah..YTA\n\nIt\u2019s rare enough for cousins to leave something in their will for cousins\u2026..and you still want a piece of it.   Wow.\n\nHow is your stepdaughter related to your cousin again?  Oh that\u2019s right\u2026she\u2019s not.\n\nYou\u2019ve taken a tragic situation and turned into a money grab.", "It's also not the brother's to give. It wasn't left to him, to decide what to do with. He would have to steal from his daughter to share it.\n\nYTA", "Wow. Didn\u2019t think of that. It makes it way worse. Disgusting.", "Exactly, there's been so many posts on here that could be easily solved by families who, instead of demanding shit that isn't theirs to demand and insisting everything be \" equally fair\" between siblings and stepsiblings, teach their kids that sometimes life isn't fair, that they won't get everything their stepsiblings will and that's just the way it is sometimes.", "Or like in the movie, [The E$tate](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tEu2xJ4c54A): \"where there's a will, there's a war\"\n\nThat movie seems kind of fitting for OP.", "u/Sad-Act-140 is a comment stealing bot, couldn\u2019t even bother to take one that isn\u2019t close to the top", "Wouldn't the money for the niece not be available for 13 years anyway? That gives stepdaughter plenty of time to get herself established in life before the money will be released", "Your 5 year old was hurt she didn\u2019t get inheritance? I call bullshit on that. YTA", ">and would lower resentment between the kids later\n\nThe only sure fire way to do this is to teach your SD not to be entitled of someone else's possessions and learn to count her blessing & be grateful. YTA", "Yeah and moreover I\u2019m pretty sure her brother could be sued by his daughter later in life if she found out he gave away part of her entitlement to OPs daughter.", "I used to volunteer for Make A Wish as a Wish Granter. Shopping sprees are common wishes, and me and another volunteer were helping out a family during their son\u2019s wish, and I was ASTONISHED at the amount of stuff he was forced by his family to buy for other people. An expensive pair of shoes for an uncle, nice sweats for a brother, accessories for a little sister. It felt really icky to watch play out, but we couldn\u2019t do anything. Entitlement is so gross.", "Not just that, but to get anything from a cousins will is pretty rare already. It isn\u2019t like this was expected money that OP was counting on getting. The fact that any of them got anything should be a surprise. The 16 yr old was fine without this money before, why are they now not fine because their cousin got some?  Will OP also expect their brother to share with them if they get a raise or promotion?  I don\u2019t see how this is different than that.", "Oh how horrible.  This has to be so devastating for all of the family.  \n\nI cannot imagine looking at that situation and demanding money for a cousin's step-daughter, especially after a marriage of only 2 years at that point (OP didn't raise this stepchild from birth as their own).", "Not necessarily- I think chosen relationship ties are important. \n\nJust cause someone marries, adopts, a person or child. \n\nThere is not a rule that all prior relationships must also now form the same love bond with this new person by default - diminishing all personal choices.", "I had a will written (by a lawyer who was legally a member of the state bar and everything!) that included any potential future children. Not just my living daughter and the daughter I was currently pregnant with, but any other children we may conceive.", "I think if there was any relevant info like your asking OP definitely would of said it to help their case the fact that they didn't mention any interactions between the two leads me to believe they hardly knew each other at all.", "My personal experience is that they are highly overrated.", "No wonder she \"left\" that part put of the OG post I feel sick to my stomach now. This person is not good. My family did this shit when my grandpa died 20 years ago and they all still hate eachother over it.", "Yes. But some people value them highly and perhaps the cousin is that way. \n\nIf OPs step daughter and the cousin had one of these chosen family love bonds then I bet they would have been included in the bequest.  It is unclear if this cousin had any relationship with the SD at all!", "They\u2019ve only been married 3 years, so it\u2019s unlikely it\u2019s too deep. Possible, but unlikely.", "Future offspring can be included in a will. Mine was made before I had a child and the wording included any legal or biological children at the time of my death.", "Grief does weird things to people and sometimes we lose our ability to be reasonable. I\u2019m truly sorry for your loss, OP, but YTA here. Glassgrl1021 has laid it out for you here.", "Exactly. He CAN\u2019T do this. It\u2019s not his inheritance. At least it\u2019s an easy no from him\u2014he couldn\u2019t say yes even if he wanted to.", "As a janitor for 5 years, I appreciate this analogy lol. OP YTA", "That is so sad.", "I mean, even if she saw op as her mom, it still wouldn't mean she was included, especially if she didn't have a relationship with the deceased", "I was kind of thinking that OP is competing with her brother.  Seems she has a \"his kid got money, so mine should too\" kind of attitude."]}
