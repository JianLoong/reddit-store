Are you going to give chunks of it out to the other kids? After all, you wouldn't want there to be resentment because your step-daughter got something and they didn't, right? \n\nAnd if your family, after finding out about your step-daughter's inheritance, called and said that she should fork over some of it over to make things fair, would you agree to it? Or would you say that they weren't related to her family, so they should get nothing?\n\nYou're disrespecting your cousin's wishes by doing this, you are being entitled, and you are teaching your step-daughter entitlement. You are demanding that your niece have less, so your step-daughter can have something, and you don't think that would cause resentment when she grows up and finds out? You want to take your niece's money from her, and your reasoning is that she's 5 and doesn't need it, as if that money can't be put away for when she does need it. \n\nI'm going to be honest, you're behaving like a vulture. Your cousin dies, and you don't think you've got your fair share of the meat, so you're trying to snatch it out of the mouths of others. Do you really think this is acceptable? If your brother passes first, will you demand his daughter hand over some of her inheritance to your step-daughter to make things fair? Because that is where your logic is taking you. \n\nYTA, and you owe your brother an apology. An inheritance is a privilege, not a right. You could have explained this to your step-daughter, pointed out lots of others weren't included, and told her that money doesn't equal love. Instead, you want to snatch money from your niece. Do better.", "YTA\n\nLike, a lot. This is incredibly bad form on your part. Your cousin chose who she wanted her estate to be divided amongst. Does it suck that your SD wasn't one of the people? Sure. That doesn't give you the right to demand that somebody give her a share of the inheritance. That's crude and gross.", "YTA - the money should be divided up how Laura indicated, that\u2019s how a will works. I assume Laura had her reasons for structuring her estate as such.", "YTA\n\nNow is not the time to start a fight about how the family treats your stepdaughter. \n\nYour cousin's will is her will and it says what is says.

Laura didn\u2019t leave your step daughter any money.  That\u2019s a fact no matter what happens now. You want your brother to steal from his child to make your child feel better.

If your SD would feel better if someone gave her money, then give her some of yours.", "I assume the other children were named and your SD was not. That's sadly how it works with step-children.

I'm shocked this needs to even be explained.", "Wait...\n\nYour cousin had a will made up giving everything to her husband and future kids? And \"if not\" then the estate would be divided between her parents, charity, and cousins kids?\n\nSo I'm assuming that she had a husband when she wrote the will, because no lawyer or notary  in their right mind would write up a document that included speculative people.   Hell, even the \"future kids\" part is suspect, in that modifying a will to include children is easily done when one gets pregnant.   \n\nYTA for manufacturing this post.", "YTA and the whole my kid could use it more excuse is just disgusting. Provide for your step daughter and shut up.", "YTA. As much as you may dislike it, your SD was not biologically Laura's niece and therefore, as per the will, does not have an entitlement to the inheritance. To ask your brother to give a portion of his daughter's share of the inheritance to your SD leaves his daughter with less than her 5 other cousins when they all should have received an equal share. It doesn't matter if his daughter is 5, you would be disadvantaging her. \n\nI understand that maybe you/your SD sees receiving an inheritance = being accepted as part of the family but maybe this is an opportunity for you to enforce to her that that isn't the case, it's just how the law works and she's loved either way. Otherwise this is only going to drive your family away from her which seems to be the opposite of what you want.", "YTA\n\nOf course she left everything to her husband and children. Unless the inheritance is telephone numbers $/\u00a3/\u20ac it's normal almost everything will go to the partner and any children.", "YTA.", "YTA. If your SD got inheritance from her father or mother's side of the family, would your first thought be she should share it w/ your niece?\n\nYou can't force familial relationships where they don't exist. Blended families are complex and the older the child is when you bring them into a relationship, the less likely they are going to be seen as equal family to kids that were part of the family since birth. That is just reality. It depends on the family, how often you are together, what the overallbfamily bonds are like, the relationship with your wife, etc. - so many factors. As long as they don't make her feel un-welcome and are kind and considerate to her, the rest is all about real bonding.\n\nYou are being greedy.\n\nI am a step-daughter and I never would have even considered, let alone expected, my step father's parents or siblings to include me in their wills.", "YTA.    Reddit is filled with people wondering why step-family members are not included in inheritance.   It blows my mind.  \n\nInheritance isn\u2019t even considered MARITAL property in many countries (as long as kept separate).    Your SD has no claim to this money.   Yes it is disappointing, but life isn\u2019t fair.   She\u2019s not related.   She has another side of her blood relatives.   Maybe she won\u2019t get any inheritance from them, but those are the breaks.", "God inheritances bring out the worst in people, including people not even in the damn will", "YTA, I never understood being pissy at inheritance your kid doesn't get, I didn't get much inheritance when my half sister passed away suddenly, I didn't get pissy and I didn't resent others that got more than me (it was also logical), I was 16yo at the time ffs, if a 16yo kid can understand that, I don't understand how all the \"Responsible adults/grown ups\" can't wrap their heads around the fact when inheritance is given, it's done and done, stop begging for money from the deads to other family members, it's plain disrespectful", "YTA. You are the reason there is conflict in the family.  Not sure why you think your stepdaughter should even be considered\u2026..unless she was close to your cousin but that\u2019s not likely since she was not included in the Will.", "YTA for several reasons.\n\nFirst, noone is entitled to an inheritance.  I think others have covered that part well.\n\nSecond, you mention your step daughter, not your adopted child.  You likely play a fatherly role, but she is your spouse's child, not your daughter.  It would be nice if your family treated her the same, but the reality is your daughter has a different father - it is not the same.\n\nThird, why would your 5 year old step daughter grow up to resent her 10 year older step cousin, unless you carefully nurture the grudge.  She's 5, she has no idea of inheritance laws, and the idea that she was slighted by a second cousin she likely barely remembers won't occur to her unless you drill it in.", "YTA, because Laura wrote her will and that\u2019s what she wanted.

BOTH ARE WRONG. \n\n4) Never take from one kid to give to another. If your brother does this, his kid will resent him, you, your husband and SD. \n\n5) NO ONE is entitled to an inheritance. NO ONE. You are fortunate if you get anything. Your asking has a sense of entitlement where none exists. \n\n6) HONOR THE DEAD. IT IS ONLY THE LIVING THAT ARE GREEDY ASKING FOR WHAT THEY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO.", "Repeat after me: NO ONE IS ENTITLED TO ANYBODY ELSE'S MONEY. \n\nYTA", "YTA and ridiculous in your request. If Laura wanted to leave anything to your SD she would have. The entitlement!", "Yes absolutely. You're in the wrong here.\n\nThe financial aspect of his wife's death are none or your business. It is his and his daughter's alone. \n\nThis was extremely disrespectful of you. Your brother deserves an apology.", "YTA.  You are being selfish asking him to give up part of his daughter's inheritance for your stepchild. He has no obligation to her.", "YTA. How is it \u201cmore fair\u201d to go against the wishes of the deceased? It was your cousin\u2019s explicit wishes to divide the money this way, and inheritances are not required to be \u201cfair.\u201d  I\u2019m sorry your stepdaughter got left out, but she is not entitled to anything. This isn\u2018t even one of those \u201cN T A for asking but, they can say no\u201c situations. The very act of asking your niece to give up money that is hers makes you TA.", "YTA. The person whose will it is chose where they wanted the money to go and you are trying to circumvent their wishes, that\u2019s really crass", "She\u2019s five ffs why does she even know to be getting upset over it? \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "YTA.\n\nWell, yeah.  It's the family legacy.  Of course your Stepdaughter isn't part of that.  You would have had the right to be upset had you adopted her, but that isn't the case.  Hopefully your cousin was nice and friendly towards her on occasions she saw her, but she wasn't her cousin and didn't owe her anything more.\n\nPart of blending families is that the kids having non-common relatives means that some may end up with more than others.  Your Stepdaughter should know that at her age.  It's your job to sit her down and explain to her why she's not in on the inheritance - not even close, although you both might have the illusion that she might be.", "She literally has no relation to the rest of the family and is a decade apart from some of the rest of the kids. Of course she gets nothing. How gross, she died and this is all you can think about. Its like people wait around there family members and as soon as they take that last breath yall are clawing for the papers. In my mind its sick but I see it so much on this subreddit\n\nYTA", "INFO: How long has your stepdaughter been in your life/your cousin's life? Are you married to their parent/do you have any parental rights over the kid?", "YTA This wasn\u2019t a typo. The deceased person decided to whom she wanted her estate to go. Guilting those people after the fact is poor form.", "YTA - you don't dictate how people split their inheritance. Does it suck for SD? Yes, but that does not mean other people need to give some of THEIR money. You can ask sure, but take a no gracefully.", "Yta, your sd doesnt need this inheritance.", "YTA the will is the will. Let it be", "YTA.  step means not related", "Shame on you, a\\*\\*hole", "YTA. There is a will, he doesn\u2019t need your input on how to distribute the money.", "Yta - before I read this & after doubled", "YTA.  The cousin specified in the will how it should be distributed.", "YTA.", "If you have a problem with the will, take it with your cousin instead of your brother.\n\nYTA, stop trying to take away someone else's inheritance and honestly, sounds like you keep pushing SD on your family and completely disrespecting their boundaries, grow up and respect them.", "YTA. Please fuck off and let your brother grieve without vultures.", "YTA. Inheritance comes up a lot here, and the answer is that you must always respect the wishes of the deceased. If you don't believe that the deceased's wishes were untainted by duress or dementia, then there are legal processes to deal with that (and they will be long, painful, damaging, destroy family relationships and deplete a large proportion, if not all, of the estate, but they exist). However, any attempt to persuade or guilt a beneficiary into sharing their legacy is 100% an asshole move.", "Cousin?! That is a weak link for inheritance. Unless a will says otherwise 100% should go to the spouse and children not to other random relatives. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything from a sibling let alone a cousin.", "I wonder if r/entitledstepparents is a sub-reddit? YTA.", "YTA. As many have written - the will clearly states who gets what. The thing to note is that it also clearly states who doesn't get anything - you may interpret it as only blood relatives but perhaps it's because your SD isn't worthy of this inheritance. The entitlement shown by her and you seems to indicate that.", "YTA while it's blood ties for them it's only money for you huh", "I\u2019m so confused.  How could someone leave something to future children?", "INFO: Was that will current? Did Laura make it after your step daughter came into the family? Or is it from before and she just didn\u2019t update it? Can you assume she would have wanted to include your step daughter and just did not update her will? Or was it an explicit decision?", "YTA\n\nHurtful, yes. Something your niece has to go without to rectify, no.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. But your cousin made her choice.\n\n(And the only way this will fire up resentment is if you stoke it.)", "So, normally I'm pretty sympathetic to stories about stepchildren not being treated equally, but this doesn't seem to have been such a conspicuous omission by your cousin. INFO: Is there some backstory we haven't been given here? Had Laura and your SD developed a close relationship over time? Could Laura have written her will before your SD came into your life?", "Ok: asshole move on your late cousin's part to exclude your stepdaughter on purpose (if that's what happened). However:\n- there won't be any resentment between the kids if you don't raise your kid that way. From the perspective of your kid, this is just an unexpected blessing that came to her cousin and unfortunately not to her. \n- how would this money be more useful for your five year old (who you're hopefully taking care of for quite some time still) than an 16 year old (who is going to be independent in the relatively near future)?", "Also, while it sucks in some situations\u2026. Blood ties are very important to people!", "This your step daughter has two parents, other family members and you who can decide if they leave her anything in will. Also your brother would be an AH if one of your spouses cousins died and that person gave step daughter money and he demanded a cut. Yta", "This!!!", "It stood out to me that she is only asking her blood brother to give up a potion of his child\u2019s. I wonder why she isn\u2019t asking the other cousins? Oh that\u2019s right. They aren\u2019t related. The irony.", "And greedy", "It wouldn't make sense for the cousin to have given OP's stepdaughter anything in their will, they're not related in any way. So I don't think OP has any right to be upset about her being excluded, did the cousin even ever meet her?", "I don\u2019t think OP actually wants stepdaughter to have it. More likely it goes in a trust, and OP charges a fee to oversee the trust.", "shaka-boom", "Well no, cause *that* would be different! /s", "WDYM YTA?! Sharing is caring!!", "We've been married for 3 years and yes, Laura and SD knew each other", "Yes she had a husband when she wrote the will, she and her husband both passed in the crash so he obviously can't take it. She changed her will a few months before to include her unborn child, as she was pregnant. I wrote it as future child since the baby wasn't born yet.", "It isn't going to her own children but to her nieces and nephews.\n\nBut not to her brother's (OP's) step child who is not her niece.", "...Yes, that's normal, but that's not what happened. If her husband/future child received this wouldn't even be a question. Since Laura's will said if not her husband, it's all to go to parents, charity and niblings. That's what this is about", "I read it niece is 5, the SD is 16.", "Also, how much money is there, considering niece is only getting 1/18 of it pre-tax I think half of it will not be enough to start a family conflict. \n\nPlus niece is not getting her part of the inheritance for another 13 years, so yeah. op will have to wait too I guess.", "If you make a will before you have them and don't want to make a new will later on.", "> asshole move on your late cousin's part to exclude your stepdaughter on purpose (if that's what happened\n\nNo it wasnt.  SD entered the family by marriage late in the game.  Barely knew cousin for 3 years.  And now OP expects SD to get money from her estate?  Come on...", "Exactly. Thing is, if OP's step-daughter inherited things and his brother asked for some of it, even if his brother and niece had a relationship with whoever left the inheritance, I'm sure OP's answer would be that they aren't related so they get nothing. Also, I'm sure if the situation were reversed, OP would be appalled. \n\nI just noticed this is money in a trust to be accessed when the kids are 18. So OP is asking his brother to raid his niece's trust. That's so scummy and could get the brother into trouble. \n\nThis isn't about blood or people not loving/caring about the step-daughter, it's about morality. No one else who wasn't left anything is proposing to take money from a 5 year old.", "Yep!", "The keyword in that question was knew each other \u201cwell\u201d, not just knew of each other but did they actually have a proper relationship?", "Knew each other.. doesn\u2019t mean they had a meaningful relationship where Laura wanted to leave her money.", "If, in 3 years, she never saw fit to include SD in the will, she did not consider her a nibling.", "Then YTA for being greedy during a tragedy.", "If she changed it a few month before dying and she has known your SD for 3+ years, then she clearly did not intend for your SD to get money.  It\u2019s her will, her clear intent, and her money. I know that it sucks for you and your SD. But that still doesn\u2019t entitle you to either money or to go against her wishes. And as much as what she did says something about how she feels about your SD, what you are doing now says something horrible about entitlement. It\u2019s not your business - that money is not your SD\u2019s and it was never ever meant for her. And stop trying to take away from your niece. \n\nOverall, this seems like such a tragic situation. It\u2019s hard to imagine that you are so laser focused on money.", "Not how I read it. The OP's post is confusing to say the least about who is who. Using names would have been far better. As I read it the OP's cousin has died and the will leaves everything to her partner (and it's unclear if there is a child(ren) from that couple).", "Your stepdaughter was your family but not Laura\u2019s. Accept it and stop hounding your brother for money that is not his! YTA", "Yes, but if her husband survived her the bit about \"if not her husband\" is not relevant, it all goes to the husband. You can't say that the alternative distribution should in some way apply if the thing that triggers the alternative distribution hasn't happened.", "How long had Laura know your SD? She probably didn't put her in the will because she doesn't see your SD as a member of the family.\n\nWas your SD ever formally adopted by you?", "So how does any of that justify SD getting $$?", "You are right, reading comprehension fail.", "My wife and I update our wills fairly often, but still have the inheritance divided between our 3 daughters and any future children.

With my luck, I'd have another kid and get in an accident driving to sign my new will.", "Right but she\u2019s already passed away, which is what got me confused", "It\u2019s not the best post - but clear enough that the money is all going to various other kids as OP had no kids and you can infer that the husband also died.", "In either case why, if raised properly, would a 16 year old be resentful because of a 5 year old?", "Hahaha I am sure that must have happened to people. Here in the Netherlands amending your will is pretty expensive, so I am definitely just rolling with future kids and then not changing it anymore", "Fully agree!"]}
