I have an uncommon allergy that is often in inactive ingredient lists, and is more common in generic brands (probably because it is cheap/common).

If that person doesn't want to take the generic version, then everyone who used the brand name should be kicking money in, not just OP who had the last dose. Regardless, OP doesn't owe anyone an entirely new package of medication, just the single dose that they took. It sounds like it is a pill, which means OP could have easily bought a $2 single dose packet from a gas station or convenience store.

Who bought it originally?\n\nThey might have the same active ingredients, but generics can genuinely cause problems. Sometimes they are cut with different trace ingredients or flavours and those can cause reactions like migraines or nausea in some people, or textural/taste differences can be difficult for people who might have sensory issues.\n\nI have chronic migraine and for some of my meds the generic versions will make me really nauseous\u2014which isn\u2019t great if I have to take them mid-migraine. Others are fine. It just depends.\n\nGenerally speaking, check in with who bought them and if you can\u2019t afford a full packet give them a few bucks towards the next one. \n\nMy verdict is NAH I think, but just be mindful that generics aren\u2019t always \u201cexactly the same\u201d for everyone who takes them.", "Should have kept the old box.", "But because you have that allergy, you would check the inactive ingredients before taking it, and you would specify that to someone if you expected them to replace it, right?
