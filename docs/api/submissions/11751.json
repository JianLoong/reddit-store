You should probably have your own stash moving forward though so you arent responsible for splitting the cost of the overpriced stuff. Maybe take the off brand for yourself and offer a small price towards a new bottle of her overpriced stuff or something, but you shouldn't need to buy a whole bottle for using one dose.", "NTA - next time just dump the generic into the brand bottle, though. Only buy a new brand name one when the date on the bottle is past. Or mar the date...", "I needed more exedrine the other day. I'm the one that uses it most cus I suffer from chronic migraines. I bought the offbrand. My roommate had no issue with it and if they did I would have told them to buy it themselves. Its the same thing. NTA", "NTA. Generic medication is almost exactly the same and it's all around my house. \n\nHowever, Doritos are Doritos and never the same. \nSome generic cereals are better for some reason. But not Doritos!", "NTA\n\nChances are that the manufacturer was the same as the name-brand product.  It might be different if the ingredients differed, but, as is generally the case, they were identical.   You should not be faulted for being an intelligent shopper.", "Save the empty bottle next time. Problem solved.", "NTA\n\nMaybe you could dig the old box out of the trash and put the new medicine in the old box?", "NTA, it\u2019s the same stuff but you can\u2019t blame the aunt for getting angry as most people are led to believe that the generic brand is less than the named brand as it\u2019s more expensive thereby better qualify", "It sounds like your gf's aunt is not very educated about generic products.  Generally speaking, you should replace products loaned to or used on you with equally good or better ones.  In this case, however, the price difference is severe and the product the same, so I am leaning toward NTA.", "NTA - it was probably made in the same factory. you can't be an AH for watching your money.  Ignore GF's aunt. You can't reason with her.", "Y T A did you use the entire package of aunts cold medicine? Then yes. You need to get the name brand or pay her the difference.\n\nNTA lol she\u2019ll be ok.", "NTA\n\nSince you only took *one dose* out of her entire bottle, it was really nice of you to replace it at all.", "NTA what is wrong with this lady", "NTA- it's literally the same thing, just a different box.", "NTA there are a handful of drug manufacturers that make OTC drugs for retailers and their products are all fine and effective. I\u2019ve seen the test reports and the data. Half the time the company making the national brand is also making the store brand. You can often recognize the same manufacturers by the lot code formats if you look at them often enough.", "If you were buying it for yourself, by all means be smart and buy generic. \n\nIn this case, you're not buying for yourself, you're buying it for whomever bought it originally. Some people have weird OCD-like tendencies about medicine brands. Just because it's the same active ingredients doesn't mean it is the same. Inactive ingredients can affect things like flavor, consistency, and appearance, which might not be important to you but it might be important to the person who chose to buy name brand. \n\nBottom line - if you use up someone else's medication and feel responsible for replacing it, then always replace it with exactly what they had before. After all, they were polite enough to share what they had with you, so return the same kindness. \n\nThe only exception is if they say they don't really care what you get.\n\nYou didn't mean to be disrespectful, so soft YTA.", "NTA\n\nYou used the last of a product, so you did the polite thing, and replaced it. Not your fault your girlfriend's aunt is ignorant and thinks generic brands aren't as effective as name brands.", "INFO: How much of it did you use? \n\nIf it's a good chunk, then you should've asked if the generic brand is okay.  If it's just a little bit, I think it's nice that you would even get a new one for them tbh", "No generic brands the same as name brand, it\u2019s same ingredients", "NTA. You took one dose. She is still coming out ahead. Just know that before you use anything of hers in the future, this is her expectation.", "NTA - If your aunt wants the $20.00 brand she can go buy it.", "Nah, they\u2019re basically the same but sometimes the inactive ingredients can be different. I personally think the name brand NyQuil works better than generic.", "NTA. Did you explain to them that it\u2019s the exact same? Bc it\u2019s possible she just didn\u2019t know, still NTA but it might have helped the situation a bit.", "YTA for two reasons. 1) If I paid $20 for a product, you used it and replaced it with a $4 product, I would be kinda pissed. I understand you probably did not use all of it  and don\u2019t want to replace the whole package with the expensive stuff. so you could have replaced it with a lesser amount of the name brand. 2) although name brands and generic have the same active ingredients, sometimes the other ingredients are not the same. Everyone\u2019s body is different so medications do not react the same in everyone. Maybe the generic does not work as well on her. Maybe she is allergic to one of the filler ingredients.", "YTA\nYou could have bought and used the cheap medicine for yourself and left these peoples sweet name brand meds alone if you didn\u2019t want to replace", "NAH\n\nWhen I borrow something that I'll need to replace for somebody, I always make sure to replace it with the exact same thing. I'm an \"any brand will do\" sort, but many people aren't.", "NTA\n\nI buy off brand all the time. As long as the product works, who cares?\n\nIf you did a blind taste test, I'm sure you can't tell the difference.", "NTA. That shit is identical except for the Name. Some shit is worth buying off brand. Your GF\u2019s aunt needs to get over herself or go buy it herself.", "NTA for buying off-brand. Pharmacist here. Innovator brands and off brands have the exact same active ingredient, hence the exact same effects. The only difference they have are the fillers they used, which doesn't really have any therapeutic effect. It is 100% a patient's right to be able to choose any brand (or off-brand, in your case) for their meds.\n\nAlthough, it's common courtesy to replace the exact same thing you borrowed or asked for, regardless of nature.", "Sounds like a bougie lady, but if it\u2019s that big of a deal tell her you\u2019ll get the original one if she\u2019s the one that bought it.", "It the exact same ingredients, its right there on the box \n\nNTA", "NTA", "Info: how much of the previous bottle did you take and who bought it?", "NTA; you were kind to replace the whole bottle after using the last little bit. The generic is the same thing functionally.", "NTA.  Chances are the generic dayquil was probably made by the same manufacturer.", "YTA for a few reasons.\n\nIt is a respect thing. They paid for it, you used it and replaced it with something cheaper. You also don't know if any of the ingredients in the store brand may have made them sick. \n\nSuggestion: Next time ask them if you can throw them a few bucks towards it if you only use one or two doses.", "NTA, you're literally buying exactly what she already had. A name brand is not a product, a name brand is a marketing gimmick. As an example acetaminophen/paracetamol is the same as name-brand Tylenol in every way except the label. Replacing Tylenol with generics is 100% fair.\n\nIt would be different if you replaced a DiGiorno with a Tombstone pizza, sure. But not with this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But when money matters generics are the best option.\n\nNTA, but if your aunt gets mad I'd offer to get her brand name.. so long as she pays for it.  And then you just use the generics.", "NTA.

When I find a brand that doesn't... I do tend to stick to it rather rigidly because the last thing I want when I'm sick is my medication to actually give me more symptoms.

So it's not just me. \n\nI wondered about this as NyQuil does seem to be more effective for me as well.\n\nAlso, I've noticed that with Dayquil, I can go 5 or 6 hours before my next dose. It's closer to 4 hours with generic.\n\nI still get generic because that extra hour or two isn't worth the price difference.

I was just illustrating that there\u2019s literally zero difference whatsoever between name brand and generic medicine. They\u2019re required to be EXACTLY the same. The only difference is the box.

The same principle still applies - when it comes to medicine, if you're replacing something that isn't yours then replace it with what they had before UNLESS they tell you that you can get whatever brand you want.
