He gave you a bike that apparently he thought was completely worthless and perhaps not even usable, and now that you've fixed it up, he thinks *you* scammed *him*?

The value of the bike was weighed at the time of the sale for $0 based on the condition it was in and his honest appraisal of its potential.\n\nI do not believe when you bought it for $0 you had any assurance that you would be able to successfully repair the bike into a good condition.  This point bears repeating: at the time it was gifted to you, the bike was not worth its final condition with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. It was worth the combination of its current condition plus the risk of investing in it. For all you reasonably knew, you would have found the bike in \\*worse\\* condition than it appeared, and the money you spent in trying to fix it up to be a waste.\n\nEven now I have doubts that the bike is really worth the amount of money your cousin thinks it is worth.

So, if his parents\u2026whose yard the bike was rusting away in\u2026are on your side, I\u2019d say you\u2019re good.", "NTA - The only reason it's worth anything is because you put the work into it. The used bike market has slowed, and nobody is going to pay for a muddy, janky, rusty cruiser with questionable tires.

Lol", "Definitely NTA, that bikes yours now. If he still wants it back after you telling him no, then tell him to pay you for all the parts you brought for the bike.", "NTA. But don't use WD-40 long term, you'll need chain grease otherwise your chain will completely rust solid.", "Definitely not, fuk him id ride it by his house pee wee herman style waving and shit", "NTA! He gave you the bike, and you put in the time, labor, and money to fix it which he was more than capable of doing himself. If he wants it back he should pay YOU $60!", "NTA. It was a gift lol, since when do you have to pay for a gift?\n\nIf he really wants it back, tell him to pay for it because you made the effort to restore it. And more than $60 ofc, since you have to pay these hours spent on and the equipment you bought at their fair value lol.", "NTA - he considered it trash, you put in work to make it a treasure. Buddy doesn\u2019t get to try and claim the bike now when he gave it away for free.", "As a resident asshole, I suggest sending the DJ Khaled \"congrats...you played yourself\" meme to him before putting notifications from his number on mute. \n\nOne man's trash is another man's treasure.

Cousin is being sketchy.", "I already had the WD-40, and the kickstand was free. The only things I had money into was the grips and dollar store nail polish. But it was still a day's labor to get it road worthy again.", "Just make sure to have the bike locked when away from it. As a side note.", "As far as I can tell, the bike is nothing special. Nor is it vintage. Maybe it is worth $60 in it's current condition. Because some people seem to want a fair amount for used beach cruisers. But it was basically worthless when I got it", "I know. It was a temporary fix to get the chain going again till I can get some proper lube on it", "Call a bike shop and ask what their hourly rate is for repairing a bike. Tell your cousin he can have the bike back minus the cost of repair material plus the labor you spent on it. I guarantee that it will be more than $60, and probably more than he could sell the bike for. He doesn\u2019t get to profit off your labor for free.", "In any event, what you did was not stealing. It's your bike to keep or sell as you see fit. If you wanted to sell it, it would be more like house flipping: buy run-down property, fix it up, and cash in on the new higher value.", "A day's labor is what he's asking for, 60 bucks. Don't sell yourself short, you learned how to care for a bike and he wants to take advantage of that. He couldn't have put it together, he couldn't have restored it, yet he's trying to scam you.", "Invest in a bike lock . I've been on Reddit too much. Cousin and / or his friends might try to steal it to get back at you.", "I know what the local bike shop's hourly rate is. $25 an hour, plus the cost of parts", "Don't even do this.  Just tell your cousin, a gift is a gift, and to  kindly f off. He's 100% in the wrong, your whole family is on your side.  Just ignore him."]}
