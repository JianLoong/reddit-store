It was a gift lol, since when do you have to pay for a gift?\n\nIf he really wants it back, tell him to pay for it because you made the effort to restore it. And more than $60 ofc, since you have to pay these hours spent on and the equipment you bought at their fair value lol.", "NTA - he considered it trash, you put in work to make it a treasure.

Nor is it vintage. Maybe it is worth $60 in it's current condition. Because some people seem to want a fair amount for used beach cruisers. But it was basically worthless when I got it", "I know. It was a temporary fix to get the chain going again till I can get some proper lube on it", "Call a bike shop and ask what their hourly rate is for repairing a bike. Tell your cousin he can have the bike back minus the cost of repair material plus the labor you spent on it. I guarantee that it will be more than $60, and probably more than he could sell the bike for. He doesn\u2019t get to profit off your labor for free.", "In any event, what you did was not stealing.

I spent a summer repairing four bikes that had been sitting outside my apartment for *years*. If anyone tried to guilt me into buying back the bikes that I put my weeks, money, and emotion into, they would get a nice fat rock to the head. Abandoned property is free for all. Cared for property is that of the carers. This is a hard lesson for your cousin that having nice stuff is useless if you don't use it.", "NTA - and ask him why he gave you junk. That's not very 'family' of him   (hahahaha)", "NTA. He gave it to you. Instead of offering support he gave you (what he thought was) garbage. And now that he knows it has some value he wants it back. He's the asshole.", "NTA realistically he couldn't expect that the bike would remain useless looking if you intended to use it. It also wouldn't be ethical for him to sell that bike for a high price since it's been fixed with wd40 and nail polish", "NTA his parents said so cause they know and if you put in the work tell him sure but I paid this and that and for your work also charge and then tell him sure I give it back to you once you paid me for doing the upgrades and tell his friends you gladly accepted their money since they are good friend they can pay off what your cousin owns you , so you can give him back the bike.", "NTA\n\nHe gave it to you.  It's your bike.", "Definitely NTA - that's ridiculous.   How did you scam him?   Unreal", "NTA. \n\nHe was fine with you taking something off his hands when he thought it was unsalvageable junk, but suddenly cares about it after you put in the work to make it nice and useable again? \n\nThat's not how it works, and I'd bet anything his friends don't have the real story here.

It *was* worthless to them. You did them a favour taking junk out of the yard. You turned that junk into treasure. Good for you. Sour grapes on their part.", "NTA.

You don't owe him a dime.", "The only reason his friends think you're a jerk is because they aren't getting the full story.  Don't discount your own effort outside the pittance of cash you spent. It wasn't 10 dollars worth of effort. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt might not even be worth $60 now. It certainly wasn't worth $60 before your efforts.", "Nta, he gave you the bike to use and got mad at you for using it.", "NTA at all. When you give something away, you\u2019ve given it away. He clearly didn\u2019t care about the bike at all until you did it up. I\u2019ve done a bike or two up in my time and sometimes I\u2019ve been given them.

In fact, you might like one I did up a couple of years ago if you check my post history.", "The bike is yours. Period. No take backs.", "Nta", "NTA - he gave you a gift, a gift is a gift.", "NTA. Once you give something away, you can\u2019t demand it back. Especially not after someone\u2019s put in money and effort to fix it up.", "NTA at all. Enjoy your bike.", "Nta if your cousin wants it back tell he he can buy it back from you for xx amount and buy a new bike", "NTA you did the work to make it look like that.  He could have done it before selling too.\n\nHeads up, scrub the chain off, wd-40 will gunk it up.  Get a silicone base grease on there.", "NTA.  He gave you what he thought was junk.  You spent time and money to make it usable.  He doesn't get the bike OR money.", "NTA. \n\nHe had the chance to clean the bike up long before he gave it to you. He\u2019s now mad at himself for not having your initiative to do the work to get a great looking bike. He\u2019s being a jerk because he realized he could\u2019ve made some money after the fact.  He has no one to blame but himself.", "One mans trash is another mans treasure.", "NTA. He gave it to you. Once he gave it to you it became yours. Ignore him, but get a good bike lock.", "Nta. Give him a receipt for the materials and your time.", "NTA, is he telling on himself that he was never trying to do you a favor in the first place?", "NTA and who gives a flying fuck what your cousin's friends think?  The bike was given to you, you fixed and you own it.  Your cousin and his loser friends can go pound sand.", "NTA.  At all.  A gift is final.  He gave it to you.  He can\u2019t now ask for it back after you\u2019d spent time and money in it.  Just ignore his friends.  Their opinion is irrelevant", "NTA. Perfect example as to why you never do business with family. Even accepting free junk. As soon as it's in good condition - they want it back.  Easy solution - well I spent $50 fixing it up and 2 hours of my time at 10$ an hour = pay me $70 and you get it back.", "NTA.\n\nwtf. I\u2019d be angry as hell. he gave that rusty, dirty crusty ass bike to you.\n\nand you just fixed it! You spent time with polishing, cleaning, touching up the paint, lubing the chains.\n\nnow he wants the fixed up nice bike back?! Cause now all of a sudden, the new pretty, clean, shiny bike is restored?! \n\nMaybe he should have kept that bike is good condition if he loves it so much in the first place. he\u2019s acting like a fool. If he says anything, state the facts. \n\nthat\u2019s very douchey of him. Wtf.", "That's the wrong way to think because where did the WD-40 come from? You still charge people for it. People will take full advantage of you if you don't know your worth.", "Your cousin already had the bike, so there goes that argument.", "I can't wait for him to sell his first car, only to rage if the new owner fixes it up or tunes it :)", "I have one. But when I go to work, I put the bike in the back room. And I bring it inside when I take it home. So I don't leave it out in the open if I can help it", "you cousin wants free money", "Just in case no one else mentioned it, wd40 isn't meant for bike chains, and it will rust.  It's more of a cleaner in this case.  You need to pick up proper bicycle chain lubricant.  I'm surprised you didn't start having issues within a block to be honest.", "Your family, including his parents, are on your side. Why do you care about what his friends are saying?", "Good!", "Or ask him why he gave you a bike that he didn\u2019t think could be made usable. In any case, under no circumstances should you give him the bike or any money.\n\nIt would be different if he gave you a bike that turned out to be valuable without knowing what he was giving away. But that\u2019s not the case.\n\nNTA", "I know. WD-40 was just to loosen the chain up. I'll lubricate the chain properly when I can. I just used the WD-40 because that's what I had on hand", "> I'm surprised you didn't start having issues within a block to be honest.\n\nEhh not really.  While WD-40 isn't great for the longevity of a chain it's not going to cause it to immediately self destruct.  When I first started riding a bike shop that I went to would host beginner rides, one of the people that almost always went on the rides was the owner of the shop.  He always sprayed his chains with WD-40 before rides. He would also recommend not to do that for your personal bike.  He would just get a new chain as soon as his started showing signs of wear.  This was also back in the where a new Shimano chain was $30 or so.", "This. My entire thought was \u201ceveryone\u2019s on your side except your cousin and *his* friends\u201d; they\u2019re not your friends, why does their opinion matter at all to you?", "Again, it's great to use as a cleaner, but now that chain is going to start rusting as you just removed all the grease protecting it.  I'm not saying you did anything wrong, I'm just trying to help prevent you from making the same mistake I did as a child, because no one told me any better.\n\nNow that said, I'm talking about normal wd-40.  If what you used has lithium, or something similar, it's not that bad.", "When I was a kid I would spray it daily, and over a week, the riding quality just declined more and more.  Then rust started showing, and the chain links would lock.  Spoke to an adult about it, and they set me straight."]}
