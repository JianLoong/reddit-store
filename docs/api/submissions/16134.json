{"id": 16134, "submission_id": "134r342", "title": "AITA for not giving back a bike my cousin gave me for free because he thought it was trash?", "selftext": "About a month ago I got a free bike off my cousin. An old red beach cruiser of unknown make. I needed a bike because my last one was stolen and I'm too broke to buy a new one. My cousin then told me he had an old beat up bike in his parents' back yard, and I could have it if I wanted it. When I picked it up, it looked a mess. Covered in mud, rusty chain, nicked paint, dry cracking on the white sidewalls of the tires. There was even moss on it. But I took it anyway and thanked them.\n\nI got it home, cleaned it up, touched up the paint with nail polish, lubed the chain with WD40, put new $7 grips on it, tightened the rear gear, cleaned most of the rust off any chrome, put on an aluminum kickstand that the bike shop tossed out as garbage, and it became my daily rider. The tubes and tires are still good, and I got it back on the road for less than $10. And honestly I like it. Rides a little bouncy, but the coaster brake is fun and it's simple and reliable.\n\nThe problem is my cousin saw me riding it last week, and at first didn't recognize it as the same bike. It was so covered in mud previously that he'd thought it was rusted over. And now he says that I scammed him, and that he wants $60 for the bike, or to give it back so he can sell it. I've refused and said he didn't want it in the first place. And I like riding it. He's calling me a jerk and telling his friends and the family I've robbed him. The family are all on my side, including his parents. But his friends think I'm a jerk. But I'm the one who put the work into fixing this bike he gave me free as trash. And I'm the one who actually uses it, unlike my cousin.\n\nSo I'm here for an unbiased opinion. AITA for not giving the bike back or giving money for it?\n\nEdit: Yes I know WD-40 wasn't a permanent solution for the bike chain. And I will get a proper lube for it later. I only used it for the moment because I already had it on hand, and it loosens rust well because it's made for that. I needed the chain working right away as I was already using the bike to go to work a day later. WD-40 is a stated penetrating lubricant, among other things. It's just not a steady lubricant because it dries out. The chain is working fine for the moment. And I'll get the right kind of grease/lube soon.", "created_utc": 1682958229, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134r342/aita_for_not_giving_back_a_bike_my_cousin_gave_me/", "score": 2046, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would straight pay for a restored bike! what is wrong with your cousin smh\n\nAlso HOW did you \u201cScAm\u201d him? His behavior is just so gross. he GAVE THAT BIKE TO YOU IN BAD CONDITION!!! if anything, he SCAMMED YOU!", "That's the wrong way to think because where did the WD-40 come from?

While WD-40 isn't great for the longevity of a chain it's not going to cause it to immediately self destruct.  When I first started riding a bike shop that I went to would host beginner rides, one of the people that almost always went on the rides was the owner of the shop.  He always sprayed his chains with WD-40 before rides. He would also recommend not to do that for your personal bike.  He would just get a new chain as soon as his started showing signs of wear.  This was also back in the where a new Shimano chain was $30 or so.", "This.

I'm not saying you did anything wrong, I'm just trying to help prevent you from making the same mistake I did as a child, because no one told me any better.\n\nNow that said, I'm talking about normal wd-40.  If what you used has lithium, or something similar, it's not that bad.", "When I was a kid I would spray it daily, and over a week, the riding quality just declined more and more.

WD-40 is not a lubricant it's a cleaning agent.", "NTA - tell him he can have it back for $100 as that\u2019s what time and parts costs to get a bike like that back on the road\u2026.", "NTA.
