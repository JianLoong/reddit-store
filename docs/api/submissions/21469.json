Riiiiiight.\n\nI'm sorry, but your friend just sounds selfish and inconsiderate to me. He clearly has no problem hiding behind his religion, using it as a shield. \n\nHe does this because then, if you criticize his action, you're criticizing his entire identity, and then he's justified in playing the victim. Effectively, he does something shitty, and if you say anything, you're in the wrong. \n\nFrankly, I think you'd be better off without \"friends\" like this anyway.

Your friend could have done it another time. It doesn't sound like a once in a lifetime funded trip to Jerusalem or something.... it's summer camp.... something pretty much every church does all the time.\n\nYour friend made a dick move. Point blank.\n\nBtw\nPlease remind your friend that a Christian told you that the real definition of using the Lord's name in vain is to use him as an excuse for our worldly purposes. \nPeople have justified terrible deeds in the name of God....but Jesus wouldn't have wanted us to hurt ppl in his name. That was the results of humans passing the blame. \nBy using God as an excuse to treat your friendship poorly he has effectively used the lords name in vain.

That\u2019s definitely an AH move for sure", "NTA. God really should have considered your plans. Also, your friend is using God as an excuse to get out of hanging out with you.\n\nPretty rock solid approach. If you get upset, you\u2019re discriminating against their beliefs.

The reasoning behind the change is irrelevant - he had committed to plans with you that sound like they required significant coordination an accommodation on your part, and then he ditched last minute.

Hope you can still go or find something else in that time. Your friend is not really an AH either, they found a religious calling and want to spend time intensifying that and helping others of the same religion. That is commendable.
