Religious or not, it\u2019s an asshole move to ditch plans (especially those with months of planning) at the last minute.", "NTA. You spent month planning something only for it to be cancelled at the last minute. It was a very selfish thing for him to do. Not really much a friend.", "NTA ---- This had nothing whatsoever with an \"epiphany\" or religion or god your friend just decided last minute to do something else and to basically think fuck you and our plans I'm going to go and work instead.", "NTA\n\nHas your friend even apologized for canceling on you so last minute? Epiphany or not, this mess is his doing, and you had / have every right to be upset by his actions. You have every right to be upset over what he did, and frankly I would seriously reconsider the friendship because this probably won't be the last time that you get ditched by your friend because \"God told me to\".", "NTA - This doesn't change my verdict but when I read the title I at least thought this dude was doing a pilgrimage or at least something to deepen his spiritual connection. But he is just going to summer camp... damn God really lowered the bar on epiphanys eh...\n\nI hate to tell ya this won't be the last time he uses religion as an excuse...", "NTA\n\nProbably best not to make plans with this person because god could interfere at any point.", "Thank the lord Jesus Christ that you got out of going on that trip with him. NTA.", "NTA - You have every right to be pissed, he should have enough respect for you and your friendship not to bail all of a sudden on something you've planned your summer around.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is not nice.", "NTA\n\n\"God\" told him to flake on your trip? Riiiiiight.\n\nI'm sorry, but your friend just sounds selfish and inconsiderate to me. He clearly has no problem hiding behind his religion, using it as a shield. \n\nHe does this because then, if you criticize his action, you're criticizing his entire identity, and then he's justified in playing the victim. Effectively, he does something shitty, and if you say anything, you're in the wrong. \n\nFrankly, I think you'd be better off without \"friends\" like this anyway. I've been burnt by the same kind of people, and they will always put their own wants first.", "His beliefs are absolutely his choice and he was inconsiderate. NTA.", "NAH.  Your friend is allowed to change his mind, and you are perfectly right to be upset about it, also.", "Well I guess the proof will be in the pudding. If he really does something with this by virtue of having an Epiphany then it will be worth it if he actually makes differences in peoples lives in a positive way. you can never really fall someone for trying to improve the condition of their lives, especially if that is by improving the condition of others lives however, if that doesn\u2019t happen, then he gets to the end of his summer and is really bummed out with his decision. I certainly wouldn\u2019t make any more vacation plans with him either way. I hope you guys get your friendship back on track.", "It\u2019s messed up that they didn\u2019t let you know in time, especially if they didn\u2019t take you into consideration of how much you enjoy this. \n\nThough you must understand that he is actually in a strong path and his sacrifices are worth it. \n\nNot everyone can sacrifice such moments for a calling especially when they can\u2019t see the call as a call to begin with. \n\nIf your friend finds the answers they sought while being a counselor then that is the main reason for this, and also others who need to find the differences as well. Someone out there will learn from your best friend from both forms of his energy. \n\nIt\u2019s just another step in understanding for my brothers and sisters so don\u2019t take it personal and they most likely won\u2019t either. If they do, then it\u2019s just because they have a sense of what is true and what is not. A trip filled with distractions, or enlighten your brothers and sisters? Yeah, easy pick here.\n\nI have a friend who helped me convert and he began counseling for young people. A couple of years later he told me his temptations had risen to the point that his family was in jeopardy. Now he is honing his self control by letting go of pointless distractions and even those that cause dmg to oneself. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the AH, but if you still can\u2019t understand after they explain to you then you should ask yourself if it\u2019s a bad friendship move or if it\u2019s truly just a selfish action to not understand. If they feel disconnected from you, it\u2019s probably because they have raised their awareness and needs less distractions or less people who don\u2019t see his ways. Nothing personal, it\u2019s just a natural Christian way of being. He must be moved accordingly. \n\nI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not an expert on this and this is all assuming on my part. \nI\u2019m also glad that I\u2019m a paradox and even though I am of Christ I still would have taken that trip and then told all my brothers and sisters about it. I guess I\u2019m just built different.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
