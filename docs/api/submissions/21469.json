Only a couple of days before our trip, my friend tells me that he had an epiphany and decided to become a counselor for some Christian summer camp for the whole summer. \n\nLooking back I feel bad for lashing out, but as someone that doesn't understand spirituality, I just got upset by the news. I want to respect my buddy's beliefs and religion but it's as if the divine being that he believes in didn't consider nor respect my schedule. I told him that and he got upset. \n\nI do feel bad and had no malicious intentions to disrespect his beliefs, not his choice. But the months worth of preparation, scheduling, and excitement going down the drain made me emotional. I've apologized to him but our relationship has been different ever since. \n\nI know there were faults on my end. I just want to see what you all think; AITA? \n\nEdit (Clarification): Thanks for all of your opinions. There were some asking if I could still go on a trip. The trip was completely canceled since he was the one who proposed the idea of the trip, and claimed he'd make arrangements to make some of our plans possible.  I did the planning and scheduling for the most part.\n\nEdit 2 (Response to question): The lash-out was relatively short. I just feel like I was frank and implied his God has no respect for man by claiming, \u2018Does he not respect my schedule?!\u2019 He became a summer camp counselor this week.\n\nI only learned after he canceled the trip that this \u2018impression\u2019 kept popping up in his mind a few weeks before the trip, which made me a lot more upset. I wish he had at least told me that, and this whole fiasco may have been avoided...\n\n I've sent him a message telling him \u2018Happy July 4th!\u2019 since he left for his camp just to be ignored. I guess you may all be right and it's time to move on.\n\nEdit 3 (Response):\nI only learned about this when I overheard him telling our colleague.

No. He had a full day in deciding to unilaterally disrespect your friendship. There is nothing in any religious text suggesting being a youth counsellor for children for a couple of months at a summer camp.

I'm deeply religious, but i don't think a religious epiphany  is not really an excuse for cancelling a couple of days before.

Anyway, I do understand what it feels like to feel divinely inspired. And unfortunately that can sometimes throw me in conflict with other considerations.  \n\nBut I also know I have to temper my inspired motivations with common sense and treat others accordingly. On some level your friend has got to be aware of the time, effort and excitement you invested in this trip. If he persists in overlooking that you may need to explain once again more calmly if you decide to try and clear the air and work past this awkwardness that\u2019s crept up between you. \n\nIf he can\u2019t forgive you for having a negative reaction to this change in plans\u2026well forgiveness is supposed to be one of the hallmark tenets of his religion.

It can be hard to navigate because you really do experience a disconnect from other aspects of your life.
