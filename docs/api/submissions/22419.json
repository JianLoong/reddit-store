I love cats, and your reasoning is on the money, starting with the litterbox in the LR/kitchen area (NO!!!!!) and ending with his track record of neglecting basic maintenance cleaning routines. It also wouldn't be good for the cat, to have such an irresponsible person in charge of its well-being. And with that kind of flakiness, yes, the cat would most probably wander outside, where it's unsafe. You did the right thing. *He* is not *your* friend.

He's also a moron for keeping it a secret from the apartment complex managers. I hope the cat was adopted from a shelter and already fixed, vaccinated and microchipped.

I didn't tell him this, but he never does his dishes or cleans so I suspect it would be the same way with taking care of a pet.\n\nI actually love animals, especially cats, and dogs, but it just doesn't make sense to get one right now. Well, he got one anyways. I came home one day and he and another one of my roommates were sitting there playing with it. I asked him why he would buy it knowing me and my other roommate were against it, and he said he needed it for his own sanity and if I was a real friend I would want him to be happy. \n\nWell, I guess I'm just not his real friend.

I do feel bad, but he shouldn't have gone behind my back and got one after we failed to come to an agreement. I pay rent, it's not just HIS house. I would have been open to talking more about it to see if we could find ways to address the concerns I had, but he didn't bother and just came home with a pet. AITA for making my best friend give their cat away?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Because of this, I waited until I was in a stable living situation before even thinking about looking for a kitten. NTA, your friend was treating the cat as an animated cuddly toy.", "NTA. You discussed it, told him no, but he did it anyway. If he's upset that's on him. And if he doesn't have $300, he doesn't need the expense of a cat either.", "NTA if he didn\u2019t have $300 for the fee, he was not able to care for his cat.", "He said he didn't want to put it in his room or bathroom, and the only other rooms in the house are the kitchen and living room. Our washer and dryer are essentially built into the wall so no laundry room", "It sounds like the cats get rehomed, hopefully to a place where it was wanted and not a lease violation.\n\nRoommate sounds too irresponsible to take good care of a cat. I choose to feel good for the cat getting a better owner (it's been days, not years, since he got kitty).", ">2. Get scratching posts and they won't scratch furniture or walls.\n\nHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\n\nLook, I love cats. I've had many of them. Some have scratched more than others; some only scratched one particular floor mat; some never scratched any furniture at all (that I could tell). But I've never had a cat who did scratch inside prefer a scratching post over furniture.\n\nI know many cats do happily use scratching posts, but it's not so simple as \"get cats a post and they won't scratch furniture.\" And even the ones who successfully transition to the post can cause a lot of damage to furniture and curtains before that transition.", "No way. OP is definitely not TA. It is completely unacceptable to bring an unwanted pet into a shared apartment. \n\nIt's also unacceptable to get a pet when you don't have the money to take care of it. A cat is not a toy to be used solely for the pleasure of a human. It's a living creature that needs care and a mature, responsible owner.\n\nIf OPs immature and careless roommate was not going to give up the cat, then OP had every right to alert the building, especially if OP could end up being liable for the cat later. Leases are legal contracts and everyone needs to respect that their behavior can affect the other members of the household.", "It is not merely \"discomfort\". I sympathized with him and was more than kind but told him that these are my boundaries. He then blatantly violated those boundaries by bringing a live animal into our shared home and told me to deal with it. I told him this was not okay, and if he didn't return the kitten I would call the apartment complex. He ignored me, so I followed through. There is a difference between being compassionate and enabling. I tried to be peaceful, he refused, I tried to then solve it in a neutral way, he refused, so I moved on to calling the complex. It really is that simple.", ">You can't say you're worried about being charged for damages while also going out of your way to tell the landlords there's a cat.\n\nYes, I can. What you said makes no sense. If the cat fucks up our furniture or apartment, the landlords can't prove who or what did it, so it gets charged to ALL of our accounts. ESPECIALLY, if they have no knowledge of a cat being in our apartment because my roommate kept it a secret from them.\n\n\"Hey I'm getting charged because my roommates cat clawed our couch. I want him to have to pay for it since it's his cat\"\n\n\"Oh I'm sorry we can't do that, there is not even a record of a cat living in your apartment\"\n\nMy friend would need to provide them written consent to have all charges transferred to his account and considering he wouldn't be able to afford it, I don't see that happening. I \"narced\" on him because he brought a living animal into our shared apartment without my consent. I can only imagine how terrible it would be to share an apartment with someone like you considering your thought process.", "I was going to say NTA but this info makes me also need to stress that your roommate is a big AH. Not only did he bring in an animal when you weren\u2019t on board, and also do so in violation of house rules (didn\u2019t register the pet), but then he gets to designate common spaces for the litter box because that\u2019s his preference? Uh NO. You\u2019re NTA at all.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't have the money for the three hundred fee, he likely did not have the money for emergency vet costs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you should be reporting loose animals to management anonymously, and then follow up with a call to your local sheriff to find out what are your options for self defense if you are attacked or chased by a loose dog. if you can use a taser, or pepper spray or whatever in self defense.  Then inform the management that these are the measures the sheriff's office informed you to take, and you intend to use.", "Yup", "NTA\n\nThis was an ALL roommate yes/1 no situation.  \n\nYou'd lose your deposit from damages, you could be on hook for unregistered animal.  And really he's so attached within ONE week.  He's trying to emotionally manipulate you.\n\nBut if you want the real world results--you may not be the AH but he will continue to think you are.  Your relationship is tanked.", "Nta. As always, if you need to have roommates you are not in the position to get a pet or kid.", "Nta if he doesn\u2019t have 300 for a fee he can\u2019t afford a cat. The minute the cat needs a vet he would realized his problem.", "NTA\n\nChris is the A H for not preparing for a pet... apartment pet fee is just the beginning. But you should have seen that when he said he didn't want the litter box in his bed- or bathroom because that meant that he never planned to clean it.", "Oh but how can it be expensive  the cat was freeeeeeeee/s. People are so irresponsible. Roomie probably had zero intention on spaying/neutering, annual shots or providing vet care.", "No offense im sure you clean. But a litter box is still a toilet and even quality clumping litter disentegrates. If you dont think litter boxes  smell even ...you are nose blind lol. Anyone who says \"oh I didn't even realize you had cats\" is either stuffed up or lying. Especially when it's in an area close to where people sit or eat. Maybe if it was on another floor they might not smell it. But in an apartment or main living area. We can smell it.", "My 100% indoor cats are constantly scratching the scratching posts and cardboard scratchers. The only time they\u2019ve ever scratched anything else is when we didn\u2019t play with them enough when we first got them and they went for the curtains. As soon as we played with them more, they stuck to the posts and cardboard. Everyone\u2019s experience and cats are different, but l indoor cats who only scratch designated scratchers do exist!", "Bought a case of corrugated scratching boards from Dollar Tree.  \nI have 4 scratch \"posts\"(3-4 boards side by side) in various rooms.  They do use them.\n\nPlus a wood scratching post with carpet on one side, corrugated cardboard on other\n\nThey also scratch floor, ottoman, back of sofa.  Yes, we've done what we can to minimize those, but they still do scratch non-approved places.\n\nMale cat climbs on TV stand and stretches up to scratch corner of TV--NEVER had a cat do that before.\n\nConfirm that cats do not magically transition.", "Yup, that's pretty much what my second paragraph says.", "The TV?? Good lord. We once had a new kitten who had to work out that the picture on the TV screen was not actually there... Took about a week of his darting around and around the TV and sometimes jumping up and over. Luckily no damage to him or the TV, and he loftily ignored it as beneath his interest after that.", "Then I apologize for misunderstanding. I thought that \u201ccats happily use scratching posts\u201d meant more that cats may scratch furniture less with scratching posts, but that there will always be some furniture scratching. I now see that you meant that some cats will use the posts instead of the furniture.", "yeah it's a very weird quirk--never had a cat do that before.  Then I'm stuck with option of spraying him with directed water(not recommended by Jackson Galaxy). And I worry about water/electronics.(I try to hit his butt).\n\nKitten is fascinated by tv/screens--had her watching Mouse video on Tablet--she was entranced.\n\nSomething like this--without Yurt [https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/4281i3/you\\_know\\_your\\_cat\\_is\\_spoiled\\_when\\_hes\\_chillin\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/4281i3/you_know_your_cat_is_spoiled_when_hes_chillin_in/)   Yes, I'm awful not to provide her a Yurt", "Ah, I could probably have been clearer. I just meant to say that all cats are different, in my very long-winded way. All good! Cats are awesome.", "NTA he asked you, you said no and he did it anyway.\n\nThat poor cat isn't a therapist, if anything you care about that cat more than he does.", "NTA.  I want a cat or a dog more than ANYTHING.  However, that\u2019s not feasible at all for me right now.  I\u2019m waiting until I can actually afford to take care of it.  I wish that I could have one and waiting sucks, but if you can\u2019t afford it, you shouldn\u2019t own it.", "NTA Your friend violated standard house courtesy policy by getting the cat despite knowing you did not agree. He also put you all in violation of your lease - you had to report it to the office to prevent being charge for the pet surcharge and an damages yourself."]}
