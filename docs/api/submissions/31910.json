I love my job and I absolutely love teaching kids. I\u2019ve never made a kid cry until today. I have a student, let\u2019s call him Sam who\u2019s 12. He\u2019s the class clown who absolutely loves attention and will do anything to get his classmates to notice him. Now, I have experience with plenty of goofy kids and I adore them. I let them joke around all the time unless they harm or disturb other students the way Sam does. Sam takes his classmate\u2019s things and throws them around the room, kicks them, spits water at them and constantly violates their space. He also hits and kicks me sometimes too but that\u2019s less concerning to me. I tried telling my boss and coworkers about this but they basically told me I\u2019m on my own. Not even a call to his parents was made.\n\nRecently, I rearranged the seating so that Sam sat far away from the other boys as he does not do the same to the girls. This worked for a couple of weeks. He spent most of the class complaining in a mumbled voice but he didn\u2019t touch anyone. But I guess he got bored of complaining because today, he spent most of class hurling insults at me in Japanese. The class is mostly second English learning Japanese kids and since I\u2019m hired as a foreign teacher, I am strictly forbidden from speaking to the kids in Japanese. \n\nAnyways, when Sam starts calling me \u201cdisgusting\u201d, \u201ca stupid old lady\u201d etc., I admit I got a little upset because I know for a fact he would not speak the same way to the Japanese staff and I knew telling him to stop would only make him want to do it more because I have tried multiple times in the past. So instead, in a loud voice I said \u201cWhat did you say? \u304d\u3082\u3044(disgusting)? What does that mean? Cute???? You think I\u2019m cute??? Thank you!!!!\u201d The other kids laughed a little and Sam got angry but he kept trying to insult me throughout the class. I kept doing the same thing, pretending to think his insults were compliments. In the end, he got so frustrated he burst into tears.\n\nAt the end of class, my coworkers saw that he was crying and I explained what happened. I got chastised for making a student cry.

I intentionally pretended to not know what this kid was saying even though we both knew very well that I did. \n2. What I did was petty and as a result, I made a kid cry.

He cried because he couldn't hurt your feelings, and that says a lot about his motives. You were pretty ingenious in the way you handled it, you annoyed an annoying kid. But the administration are AHs for not helping the kid out, he clearly has issues and could benefit from some support. Also they are AHs for allowing him to behave in that way and physically assault you - yes it's assault even if it's being done by a child. He's going to be bigger and stronger soon and should really be stopped before he really hurts someone.", "You're NTA. If the Administration at your school wasn't going to back you up, you had to get resourceful. Sam was begging for attention, he got it. Too bad it wasn't the kind of attention he wanted. \n\nHe could have stopped at any time. He didn't have to keep it up until his frustration got the better of him. He is 12. Old enough to know that actions have consequences.", "Nope. Good job!", "NTA - It sounds like you were trying to diffuse a difficult situation with humor and positivity, especially considering the language barrier, and your coworkers should be more supportive in addressing the ongoing behavioral issues with Sam.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Someday he needs to learn that his actions have consequences.  Oh, so he is sad? Boo hoo.  What about how he has made all of his classmates feel for who knows how long? \n\nI can't imagine the discussion with the School Principal. \"Oh my, he was insulting me, so I thanked him. Why is that a problem?\" Good luck", "I don't let him hit me. I do everything I can to scold him as soon as it happens and we've had several counseling sessions with him and the administration outside of class. It's not like I can hit him back."]}
