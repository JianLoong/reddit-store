It was a family only event- the only friends invited were the MoH and best man. We wanted it small! In total there were a bit over 60 guests.\n\n\nOnly one of my parent\u2019s siblings has children, my uncle with 6 to be precise. We joke that he made up for none of my aunts having kids. I\u2019m an only child. Only 1 of my cousins is close to me and I strongly wanted him and his girlfriend (who I\u2019m also close to) in attendance. When I brought that up to my mom she insisted that if I invite him I also need to invite his siblings for fairness. That wasn\u2019t the plan initially but whatever, an extra 5 guests. Invites went out and we received RSVPs yes from all\u2026 including 4 SOs of the cousins. Annoying since we didn\u2019t invite our own friends to keep the numbers down but I didn\u2019t want drama and just accepted it. \n\n\nThe wedding was magical and went off without a hitch! My uncle\u2019s table was the only one not to participate in anything but hey, their prerogative. We opened the gifts the next day and received a check for $1,000 from \u201cthe (their name) family.\u201d A generous amount for sure but a group gift that wasn\u2019t even individually signed. Again, fine, all gifts are appreciated. The cousin I\u2019m actually close to snuck us a card with their own gift.\n\n\nSince then 3 of my cousins have gotten engaged. The first was on short notice, planned in a matter of months. It was last weekend and my husband and I were invited to the cocktail hour but not ceremony or dinner. Yet again, fine. It was only a 2 hour drive so easy enough to pop over and then head home the same day. We said hi to everyone but left early since it was mostly their friends with very few people we knew. Our gift was $250. \n\n\nYesterday I was shocked to see my newlywed cousin was calling. I figured she was doing the give a call instead of formal thank you note thing\u2026 nope, it was to berate me for being a selfish bitch and only gifting her a fraction of what \u201cshe\u201d gave me. I was confused because the gift we received was technically from 7 couples, her name wasn\u2019t even on the card. I tried to explain this since we really don\u2019t have the money to be gifting $1,000 for multiple weddings. She hung up on me. Since then she has sent me multiple articles about manners and how you are meant to match the wedding gift you were given.\n\n\nI asked my parents how much they gave and found that they had given $1,000 as a gift from our family, specifically naming my husband and I on the card. So I\u2019m a little frustrated- if a \u201cfamily\u201d gift is appropriate then the $250 we gave is a bonus and the amount was matched. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t want to start anything so I haven\u2019t pointed this out to my cousin. However I\u2019m still getting texts from her and her siblings about how greedy I am. We have been uninvited to the next cousin wedding because they don\u2019t want to \u201cwaste money on trash like us that don\u2019t reciprocate.\u201d Are we really AHs here?", "created_utc": 1701530761, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18960us/aita_for_not_properly_matching_a_wedding_gift/", "score": 1893, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
