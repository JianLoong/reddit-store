It was a family only event- the only friends invited were the MoH and best man. We wanted it small! In total there were a bit over 60 guests.\n\n\nOnly one of my parent\u2019s siblings has children, my uncle with 6 to be precise. We joke that he made up for none of my aunts having kids. I\u2019m an only child. Only 1 of my cousins is close to me and I strongly wanted him and his girlfriend (who I\u2019m also close to) in attendance. When I brought that up to my mom she insisted that if I invite him I also need to invite his siblings for fairness. That wasn\u2019t the plan initially but whatever, an extra 5 guests. Invites went out and we received RSVPs yes from all\u2026 including 4 SOs of the cousins. Annoying since we didn\u2019t invite our own friends to keep the numbers down but I didn\u2019t want drama and just accepted it. \n\n\nThe wedding was magical and went off without a hitch! My uncle\u2019s table was the only one not to participate in anything but hey, their prerogative. We opened the gifts the next day and received a check for $1,000 from \u201cthe (their name) family.\u201d A generous amount for sure but a group gift that wasn\u2019t even individually signed. Again, fine, all gifts are appreciated. The cousin I\u2019m actually close to snuck us a card with their own gift.\n\n\nSince then 3 of my cousins have gotten engaged. The first was on short notice, planned in a matter of months. It was last weekend and my husband and I were invited to the cocktail hour but not ceremony or dinner. Yet again, fine. It was only a 2 hour drive so easy enough to pop over and then head home the same day. We said hi to everyone but left early since it was mostly their friends with very few people we knew. Our gift was $250. \n\n\nYesterday I was shocked to see my newlywed cousin was calling. I figured she was doing the give a call instead of formal thank you note thing\u2026 nope, it was to berate me for being a selfish bitch and only gifting her a fraction of what \u201cshe\u201d gave me. I was confused because the gift we received was technically from 7 couples, her name wasn\u2019t even on the card. I tried to explain this since we really don\u2019t have the money to be gifting $1,000 for multiple weddings. She hung up on me. Since then she has sent me multiple articles about manners and how you are meant to match the wedding gift you were given.\n\n\nI asked my parents how much they gave and found that they had given $1,000 as a gift from our family, specifically naming my husband and I on the card. So I\u2019m a little frustrated- if a \u201cfamily\u201d gift is appropriate then the $250 we gave is a bonus and the amount was matched. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t want to start anything so I haven\u2019t pointed this out to my cousin. However I\u2019m still getting texts from her and her siblings about how greedy I am. We have been uninvited to the next cousin wedding because they don\u2019t want to \u201cwaste money on trash like us that don\u2019t reciprocate.\u201d Are we really AHs here?", "created_utc": 1701530761, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18960us/aita_for_not_properly_matching_a_wedding_gift/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since they decided to go nuclear by uninviting you to future events and harassing you, I would send the cousins a comparison of $1000 < $1250 every time one of them texts you. I would also say that if they did follow basic manners and know basic math, then they would understand that their actions lack maturity. I would also tell your uncle and parents about the treatment you\u2019ve received. If it was my parents, they would be so pissed.", "NTA.  There's no such thing as matching gifts, your cousins are greedy and you need to start blocking people.", "I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m just really stuck on how someone could be invited to cocktail hour but not the ceremony or reception. That makes zero sense.\n\nThis whole thing is so over the top and ridiculous that I have a very hard time taking any of this seriously.", "NTA. Put out a group text showing that the \u201cfamily\u201d gift was not actually collected from members and none of them signed the card.  That your parents actually gave the gift and courteously put \u201cfamily\u201d on the card to not embarrass them but since they are bitching about a gift you gave, you wanted everyone to know that they are bitching about something they didn\u2019t actually do to begin with.

RSVP yes then don\u2019t show up.", "NTA, they're trying to take advantage of you and your family by trying to get 2k when they only put minimal effort.\nI would reach your uncle pretending you're confused. Like \"sorry, uncle, but my mom gave your kid 1k plus I gave 250. They're now all writing to me I should have given 1k too because they did. But the truth is I only received 1k from you as 'the family,' which is exactly what my mom did. Did I miss their 1k cards? Did they maybe gave it to someone at the venue? Please let me know, I'm afraid their cards have been stolen because they're literally talking as if they've given me 1k each!\"", "NTA. The gift was from the family. Your parents gifted the same amount and included you on the card. You still gave 250.", "If the cousin you are close with is not bashing you like their siblings, I would be petty and start saving my money now to give them $1000 for their eventual wedding. Is the uncle aware of his children\u2019s shenanigans? I would be asking him why his children think a group gift from him and his children is okay to give you, but one from your parents and you is not acceptable. If you ask be puzzled and inquisitive, not accusatory.

To be fair, I should give your family a total of $1000 that adds up for each wedding.  Technically I should have only given you $166 but I gave you $250.

It\u2019s strange to give a gift and expect something back so this \u201cmatch gift\u201d narrative is nonsense. Not to mention your parents already \u201cmatched\u201d the gift so it seems they\u2019re the greedy ones.
