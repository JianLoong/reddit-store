It was a family only event- the only friends invited were the MoH and best man. We wanted it small! In total there were a bit over 60 guests.\n\n\nOnly one of my parent\u2019s siblings has children, my uncle with 6 to be precise. We joke that he made up for none of my aunts having kids. I\u2019m an only child. Only 1 of my cousins is close to me and I strongly wanted him and his girlfriend (who I\u2019m also close to) in attendance. When I brought that up to my mom she insisted that if I invite him I also need to invite his siblings for fairness. That wasn\u2019t the plan initially but whatever, an extra 5 guests. Invites went out and we received RSVPs yes from all\u2026 including 4 SOs of the cousins. Annoying since we didn\u2019t invite our own friends to keep the numbers down but I didn\u2019t want drama and just accepted it. \n\n\nThe wedding was magical and went off without a hitch! My uncle\u2019s table was the only one not to participate in anything but hey, their prerogative. We opened the gifts the next day and received a check for $1,000 from \u201cthe (their name) family.\u201d A generous amount for sure but a group gift that wasn\u2019t even individually signed. Again, fine, all gifts are appreciated. The cousin I\u2019m actually close to snuck us a card with their own gift.\n\n\nSince then 3 of my cousins have gotten engaged. The first was on short notice, planned in a matter of months. It was last weekend and my husband and I were invited to the cocktail hour but not ceremony or dinner. Yet again, fine. It was only a 2 hour drive so easy enough to pop over and then head home the same day. We said hi to everyone but left early since it was mostly their friends with very few people we knew. Our gift was $250. \n\n\nYesterday I was shocked to see my newlywed cousin was calling. I figured she was doing the give a call instead of formal thank you note thing\u2026 nope, it was to berate me for being a selfish bitch and only gifting her a fraction of what \u201cshe\u201d gave me. I was confused because the gift we received was technically from 7 couples, her name wasn\u2019t even on the card. I tried to explain this since we really don\u2019t have the money to be gifting $1,000 for multiple weddings. She hung up on me. Since then she has sent me multiple articles about manners and how you are meant to match the wedding gift you were given.\n\n\nI asked my parents how much they gave and found that they had given $1,000 as a gift from our family, specifically naming my husband and I on the card. So I\u2019m a little frustrated- if a \u201cfamily\u201d gift is appropriate then the $250 we gave is a bonus and the amount was matched. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t want to start anything so I haven\u2019t pointed this out to my cousin. However I\u2019m still getting texts from her and her siblings about how greedy I am. We have been uninvited to the next cousin wedding because they don\u2019t want to \u201cwaste money on trash like us that don\u2019t reciprocate.\u201d Are we really AHs here?", "created_utc": 1701530761, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18960us/aita_for_not_properly_matching_a_wedding_gift/", "score": 1089, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Etiquette does not dictate who will give what gift to whom or its value.  It's a GIFT, not a price for staying on her good side. It's not required that each gift must be of a certain value . People receiving GIFTS are obligated to say thank you, even if the gift was $10.  It's a GIFT. \n\nNo wedding/reception/whatever guest is ever required, or required to give a gift of a certain minimum value. Does she assess the financial well-being of each guest before they are invited? That's just cheesey and marks her out for being a mercenary.\n\nThe one upside? Now you know what your cousin is really like. Sorry.", "NTA\n\nYour cousins rationale doesn't make any sense, on the equity front.... Family gift of 1k went in each direction, and you ALSO gave a gift of your own.\n\nBut also, you give the gift you're able.\nGetting married isn't a cash grab. We don't criticize the gifts we are given. And I'd say only inviting people who will give you a big gift is absolutely not the point of the ceremony. These are the people you want witnessing your union. \n\nSilver lining?\nYou're off the hook for the rest of the jerks. \nIt might be petty to suggest to you parents that they reduce their gifts by your amount?

She is flat out stupid!", "NTA divide the total gift by the number of family members and gift that moving forward.", "NTA. We have given $50 to every cousin wedding we\u2019ve gone to. They\u2019re all younger than us so we didn\u2019t receive a gift from them directly for our wedding, but they were included in the family gift from their parents.

I'm not sure if the \"cocktail hour\" was considered the reception.  I don't see how since there was a dinner after the ceremony.  I think your gift was substantial since you weren't invited to the ceremony and dinner.", "NTA - you don\u2019t give gifts to expect similar amounts back.

Only one group of people are trash here and it\u2019s not you. Wedding gifts are not obligatory. No one is entitled to receive a gift. But you actually did give a very generous gift in addition to the one your parents gave. Absolutely unhinged behavior.", "NTA, I would send 1 long group text to them explaining again why she was gifted the 250. How I know the 1000 wasn't from her alone but from their family and that since their was 7 of them that actually means it was 143 per couple which means i not only matched but added extra(since they want to keep being rude about it), and that im fine with being uninvited because I have no desire to be around childish people who want to create drama, so I hope she and the rest of them have good weddings, then I would block them all on everything and just focus on my life. If you do have to see them again at family events or whatever just ignore them", "NTA.  You never get married with the intent of getting gifts. Everyone gives gifts, usually money, but it sounds like that was some of the motivation for her.  I think the gift you gave was plenty generous regardless of how much you got from that group. That \"family\" really only gave you $140 each couple so you went beyond that.\n\nSHE is the AH for calling and saying anything...be happy with the gift you got and move on you greedy girl!\n\nShould you \"match the gift you were given\" I suppose in theory that is nice to do but not everyone can...and again, you should never EXPECT a gift of any size or amount from a wedding guest.", "NTA.  The proper response to a gift is \"Thank you\" whether you like or not.\n\nBut it's time for a group text to that whole side showing the break down individually of the gift they gave you (I think another poster said it comes to $71 each).  Your gift comes to $125 each (you & your husband) so you out paid any of them.  PLUS you were included in the $1000 from your family.  So if anything, THEY owe YOU money!  Because you got a total of $1000 and they got a total of $1250.  It's pretty simple math.", "Esp when only invited for cocktails. I generally only give that amount as a wedding gift.", "$250 is way more than I\u2019d give for a gift period, but if I had that kind of cash to throw around, it wouldn\u2019t go to a cousin of all people.
