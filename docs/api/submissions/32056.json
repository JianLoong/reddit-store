{"id": 32056, "submission_id": "187m02e", "title": "AITA for telling my fianc\u00e9 I dont prefer his hair short?", "selftext": "I (31f) have been with my fianc\u00e9 (35m) for almost 6 years. When we met, his hair was medium length. He has curls that are to die for. Think Adrian Grenier from Entourage but dirty blonde. \n\nI've always been into beauty and fashion, I even took some cosmetology classes in the past. I'd say I'm pretty hip to what hairstyles go with different face shapes and things like that. My fianc\u00e9 has had to wear his hair a bit shorter for work, which makes sense and it looks fine. He still has a few inches of curls and is really cute! \n\nHowever, about a month ago, while I was out of town, he cut his hair down to less than an inch and took some clippers to the sides and the back in attempt to create a fade. He's never done this before. He couldn't even see the back of his head. My reaction was like of like \"omg what did you do??\" It didn't look terrible but it was a huge change. He is a very attractive man, but he has some larger features and having super short hair accentuates them (no shame in that, I have a long face so I have a fringe and wear my hair in ways that balance things out). Again, it wasn't horrible and he's always going to be attractive to me - but the haircut didn't suit him in my opinion and it was hard for me to hide my shock when I saw it. \n\nBeing a dude who is clueless about beauty and fashion, he didn't see the big deal but recognized that I didn't like it and we kind of laughed it off. He joked about me disliking his short hair. There were no hard feelings, it's just hair. It was clear that I love him no matter what but that I didn't like that haircut. Again, this was a month ago, so it's grown out some and people we haven't seen in a while are still saying \"woah, you cut your hair!\" Just to give you an idea about how drastic it was. \n\nSo today, he mentions that he wants to cut his hair short again and shave his face. I jokingly said \"nooooo!\" Then followed it up with \"haha do what you want to do, I'll love you no matter what but I would be happy if you never used clippers on your hair again.\" He shut down and said \"yikes. Point taken. I have to go.\" \n\nI didn't think this was a sensitive subject, so I was being playful when expressing my dislike for this idea. Maybe I'm just an asshole, but I'm sitting here wondering what kind of reaction he was expecting? Maybe saying \"I'd be happy if you never used clippers again\" was harsh, but I was coming from a playful place. I wouldn't have phrased it like that had I known he was feeling sensitive about it but because we made jokes in the past, it didn't feel wrong to say. \n\nNow I'm wondering if I should have just said nothing & just let him express himself however he wants and I'm putting too much importance on physical appearance? Or if I was ok to express that something isn't exactly a turn on to me? I apologized for coming across too harsh but now I'm doubting myself for even caring in the first place.\n\nEDIT: addressing recurring questions/comments - \n\n\"If roles were reversed\" - roles have been reversed. I've changed my hair and he's let me know when he doesn't like it and I grew it out and didn't do it again. Not because he made me, but because I like when he thinks I look good. I don't expect him to base his appearance off my opinions, but I let him know what they are so he has the option to take it into consideration. Neither of us are controlling one another's appearance by saying what we like and don't like. \n\nWhich leads me to my next point - I didn't harp on him for his hair. I don't bully him. I had an initial reaction and literally never brought it up again. The only time it was talked about was when he brought it up. He would playfully joke about how I didn't like his haircut and I would play back but always leave him reassured that I love him and I think he looks good no matter what. I had no reason to believe this was a sensitive topic. So when he said he was cutting it again, I thought a playful and slightly dramatic response would be fine. Clearly I made a mistake thinking that and have since apologized and we are fine. But I don't talk about how much I dislike his haircut like it's a normal topic of conversation. I don't bring it up literally ever. I'm not mean to my fianc\u00e9. I quit working to cook him 3 meals a day, do his laundry, and take care of him because I love him. It's crazy how some of you are saying I'm a terrible fianc\u00e9 and he deserves better because I told him I didn't like his haircut. \n\nAlso - I never said directly to him why I think it's a bad haircut. I'm not out here trying to make him feel insecure by pointing out his features, I just wrote that on here so you can have a peek into my thought process (as someone who is thinking about this like a hair stylist) before making a judgement. As far as he knows, I just don't prefer his hair short. I'm not trying to destroy his self esteem.

You expressed your opinion, that's all. You didn't demand he not cut his hair or make threats like you'd leave if he did. Sounds like he didn't fully grasp how much you didn't like it though.", "NAH. I think what you said was reasonable, benign, and gently/playfully worded. It's ok to have a preference and to express it. I think his reaction was a bit severe but it probably speaks to him having more serious feelings about this than you've realized. \n\nIf I were you, I would maybe say something like \"Hey I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings in anyway with my comment about the clippers. I think you know I love your curls and facial hair, but if you want to go really short I can support that.\"", "I think you would be the asshole if you continued to do it now that you know he didn\u2019t appreciate your comment. If you *do* love him no matter what length his hair is, I\u2019d just stop commenting on it altogether.", "I think NAH bec you didn't realize he was sensitive about it and you meant it in a joking way but you'd be the asshole if you mentioned it again.\n\nAlso you should apologize bec you did hurt his feelings even if unintentional.", "NAH.

This guy is a hypocrite.", "INFO: How would you feel if you cut your hair a certain way and liked it, then your fianc\u00e9 made a comment on it? Would you not care or would you be hurt?", "NAH.\n\nThe lesson here is that, whatever you said in a \"playful tone\" when you first saw his hair until today, did not sink in to him as a real comment or a serious preference.  Otherwise he wouldn't have said he was going to cut it again.\n\nIf it mattered to you, then at some point in the last month you should have said to him in all seriousness, \"I would like it if you let your hair grow out the way it was before.\" and maybe follow up by using some of your skills to help him make it look as good as possible while it grows out.\n\nI'm sure if it's grown out a month, it now looks worse than a month ago and not as good as it did before.  So he wanted to make it look better, and you can't grow it out in one day.\n\nMy wife knows I prefer her hair longer.  She grows it out and then wants a change and cuts it short.  But she expects me to notice her new haircut and say \"It looks good!\" every time because there's no point in going over it again.\n\nPerhaps because of that, I can't get her to tell me whether she likes me better with the beard I've been wearing for \"Brovember.\" So I have no idea whether she would be happy or sad if I shave it off tomorrow.", "This sounds like an episode of Schitts Creek lol.\n\nIn healthy relationships you should be able to express yourself freely\u2026 within reason. You have to look at him every day lol so it\u2019s not wrong to have and express an opinion on his hair.\n\nBut at a certain point, he knows. And if he wants to keep it short that\u2019s his prerogative. And if he does, you need to stop bringing it up. He knows, and he is making a choice.\n\nThe last time I went into the salon I mentioned cutting my hair and my husband had a panicked look on his face lol. But he didn\u2019t say anything because he knows that I know what his preference is, but he also knows it\u2019s my hair! He did express joy that I only got a trim later tho lol.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is probably sensitive about it, and you\u2019ll get to a point where you can joke about it.

When he comes back, say: \u201chey, I am sorry about my earlier comment. I definitely was just joking around and thought we were being playful. But I obviously hurt your feelings. So while yes, I do prefer your hair a bit longer, I still find you sexy as hell with short hair. It\u2019s your hair and you\u2019re the one that has to manage it and it\u2019s upkeep.

That\u2019s when it went from a little joke to you really reinforcing that you hate his hairstyle well beyond what is normal.\n\nYou ask what kind of reaction he was expecting.

I think it's fair be sensitive about your partner not liking a certain aesthetic choice but it sounds like he also didn't properly communicate that this was something that was sensitive to him.\n\nI think you should apologize for this time and maybe add that if something is bothering him the future, he should let you know in the moment instead of laughing it off, otherwise it is very difficult to be conscience of his feelings.", "YTA.

When we met, his hair was medium length. He has curls that are to die for. Think Adrian Grenier from Entourage but dirty blonde. \n\nI've always been into beauty and fashion, I even took some cosmetology classes in the past. I'd say I'm pretty hip to what hairstyles go with different face shapes and things like that. My fianc\u00e9 has had to wear his hair a bit shorter for work, which makes sense and it looks fine. He still has a few inches of curls and is really cute! \n\nHowever, about a month ago, while I was out of town, he cut his hair down to less than an inch and took some clippers to the sides and the back in attempt to create a fade. He's never done this before. He couldn't even see the back of his head. My reaction was like of like \"omg what did you do??\" It didn't look terrible but it was a huge change. He is a very attractive man, but he has some larger features and having super short hair accentuates them (no shame in that, I have a long face so I have a fringe and wear my hair in ways that balance things out). Again, it wasn't horrible and he's always going to be attractive to me - but the haircut didn't suit him in my opinion and it was hard for me to hide my shock when I saw it. \n\nBeing a dude who is clueless about beauty and fashion, he didn't see the big deal but recognized that I didn't like it and we kind of laughed it off. He joked about me disliking his short hair. There were no hard feelings, it's just hair. It was clear that I love him no matter what but that I didn't like that haircut. Again, this was a month ago, so it's grown out some and people we haven't seen in a while are still saying \"woah, you cut your hair!\" Just to give you an idea about how drastic it was. \n\nSo today, he mentions that he wants to cut his hair short again and shave his face. I jokingly said \"nooooo!\" Then followed it up with \"haha do what you want to do, I'll love you no matter what but I would be happy if you never used clippers on your hair again.\" He shut down and said \"yikes. Point taken. I have to go.\" \n\nI didn't think this was a sensitive subject, so I was being playful when expressing my dislike for this idea. Maybe I'm just an asshole, but I'm sitting here wondering what kind of reaction he was expecting? Maybe saying \"I'd be happy if you never used clippers again\" was harsh, but I was coming from a playful place.

So I'm just chiming in to say I get it. Sometimes you can't help but dislike a look, no matter how much you want to support someone's right to autonomy. Where it can be even more confusing and frustrating, is if they are really attached to the look, despite how you feel. Like, don't you care about whether I find you attractive as my partner?

The cut really didn't suit him, and he could tell I didn't like it.

This is what I\u2019m saying.", "Well, ARE they supposed to flatter your features? Says who?\n\nNot trying to be asinine, most of us want to have hair cuts that we feel look good on us. But who gets to decide that? Who gets to decide what features are \u201cbad\u201d and should be minimized, and which are \u201cgood\u201d and should be accentuated? Who gets to decide how far you can justifiable deviate from your ideal cut for the sake of comfort (eg, I have short hair. If I looked better in long hair, should I grow my hair out, even though I can\u2019t stand long hair and I hate it?)\n\nWhat if you really love a certain cut and you actually don\u2019t care if it makes your nose look big or not? \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with expressing an opinion. Until there is. It depends on what your opinion is and how, when and whether you express. If my opinion is \u201cI think you\u2019re stupid and ugly\u201d and I say that to you for no reason, is that cool because it\u2019s \u201cmy opinion\u201d? \n\nAnd in cases where it might be reasonable (opining on a hair style IS sometimes reasonable, IMO) how many times can you express a negative opinion before now you\u2019re just being shitty?", "Oh, no, my partner finds me attractive even when my hair isn\u2019t his preferred length, lol", "I have done that before \ud83d\ude02.\n\nI know I\u2019d like his honest opinion, always, which is why it\u2019s a bit of a dilemma, but I don\u2019t know that he needs mine.

How can anyone have hair that they don\u2019t run past their nookie nookie babe?", "OP said that her boyfriend has, in the past, had a negative opinion of a haircut she tried out and she took his feedback under consideration and grew her hair back out. So it seems greatly unfair to hold her to the double standard that she gets to express no opinion in return.\n\nHaving an opinion on your partner\u2019s choices isn\u2019t wrong. The problem usually comes when you try to use leverage to force your partner to follow your preference, or when you hold your partner to a certain standard of appearance that you yourself do not adhere to, especially when it\u2019s extremely costly in time, money, or even physical pain to maintain (such as waxing). When men are criticized for their opinion in this matter, it\u2019s usually because they fall into one or both of those camps.\n\nThere's also a difference between having an opinion and having an unrealistic or unfair expectation, and that's usually what makes the difference in posts where men are criticized. Men also often underestimate how much work it takes to maintain certain kinds of hairstyles, so when they ask for a certain kind, they may not realize how much work is involved in it because their own hair takes five minutes to set right in the morning. \n\nSimply having and expressing an aesthetic opinion is not a problem. Having a preference isn't a problem, either. But it's when you try to punish your partner for not adhering to that preference, or constantly complain, or put them down, that it becomes a problem.", "Omg you really think \u201cuneven\u201d hair isnt bad enough to be pointed out?", "It's not only just because \"the hair is short\". They also cut the back without looking at it and did a bad job according to OP. So it veers more into being a bad haircut.", "It might be unusual but same in my marriage. My husband is basically a blob of \"my man\" energy to me, what he's looking like doesn't really register to me. Which was very useful when he decided to go from his decades long look of buzzcut & clean shaven former army dude to a long haired hippy freak rocking every possible moustache & beard combo he felt like. He looked absolutely absurd at times but it's his face (and his professional career) so I'd tell him he looked dumb and moved on. Back to my man energy.\n\nI think I hated the 70s porn-stasche the most. \ud83d\ude2d", "That has nothing to do with what OP said. She said it was about being trained to notice these things", "ok.\n\n People pay stylists to give them the haircuts they want. He is getting the haircut he wants. Anything you have to be trained to notice isn't noticeable and does not matter.", "you aren't his stylist", "Are you a stylist? Are you a hairdresser? Did he ask you for your opinion even on what looked best?", "I mean this with kindness \u2014 literally, no sarcasm \u2014 you DON\u2019T want him to be happy more than you want him to know that you aren\u2019t happy with the haircut. \n\nIf you did, you would never have said anything. \n\nRelationships are like pieces of paper \u2014 you can\u2019t uncrumple them. And you have to consciously not-crumple them. \n\nWhen you made comments about the haircut, you hurt his feelings. And it was more important to you in that moment to express distaste than it was to consider how he would feel about what you said. You have to ask yourself: \u201cWhat matters more? His feelings or him knowing I don\u2019t like the haircut? Why do I need him to know I don\u2019t like it?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not tryna be an asshole at all. In my first marriage I would\u2019ve done what you did. In my second marriage, which is a really happy one, I\u2019ve learned that how my wife feels about herself is truly the most important thing at the core of any conversation about her appearance. If she\u2019s feeling it, then I\u2019m feeling it, because I love seeing her feel good about herself. It gives neither of us benefit for me to even fleetingly police her choices. \n\nAll this said: if he seeks actual opinions \u2014 like wants to know for real \u2014 there are kind ways to share. My wife will tell me, \u201cI love when there\u2019s length to your hair because I love seeing the color and the style of it then. But I also know that keeping it short in summer is so much easier for you and I love how stress free you get to be when you do your summer cut and we go to the beach, etc!\u201d That\u2019s a kind way of saying \u201cI like it longer but totally get why you shortened it.\u201d\n\nMost of the time, someone asking \u201cDo you like this?\u201d is actually them saying \u201cPlease tell me I\u2019m okay.\u201d It\u2019s a chance to affirm that you love them and their happiness, not a chance to burn them.", "*he didn't see the big deal but recognized that I didn't like it and we kind of laughed it off.* ***He joked about me disliking his short hair.***\n\nTelling your partner your preference and joking about it because *he joked about it* isn't close to telling the guy what he can and can't do at all.", "The only way this could be in any way even a little similar is if he made jokes about like, her being attracted to him because of his prosthetic leg and she also joked about being attracted to his leg. And yeah I think it is, if the joke is about *her behavior* then it makes sense to infer that a) her behavior isn't a problem, b) the topic isn't a big sensitive subject, c) she can joke about that same behavior.", "\"break your self-esteem,\" LOL.", "Hey stranger.\n\nYa I am, already got all my other stuff done so this is my social media time, which I like to use by participating in the comments.\n\nAre you wasting too much energy responding to the person who you apparently can not give a rat's ass about?", "How? By telling you that you don't get to dictate what I do with my hair and beard? Again, you sound really dumb", "I told him my opinions on his hair cut the day he had it cut.

She did only mention it once. Since then, it has always been him mentioning it, and she matches his energy, which is normal in every relationship ive seen. If your partner is joking about it and hasnt communicated an insecurity, you can't be expected to know. \n\n\n\nMy fiance is beautiful and had long, almost butt length hair that I think is glorious and beautiful on him. If he said tomorrow he wanted to cut it all off, my reaction would be a playful \"Nooooooooo! My preciousss!\". Not because I am telling him not to (which he is well aware of) but because it falls in line with the ways we joke about his hair and my love of it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHim telling her he's cutting again and her instigating the joke for the *first* time since the initial reaction is also imo natural progression of the joking that he hadn't told her was a soft spot.", "That definitely changes the context.

I genuinely believed this was not a sensitive subject due to prior conversations with him about these things. If I had literally any clue that this would have hurt his feelings, I never would have said what I said. He used to make jokes about me disliking his short hair, this was a subject of teasing/flirting/being playful... no indication that this was a sore subject.

You don\u2019t see that?", "I mean there\u2019s a big difference between saying you like your partner altered from their natural state (eg dying their hair another color) vs something that takes the same amount of alteration (one hair cut vs another).

When both people in a relationship care about looking good for each other, honest (but not unkind) feedback is both healthy and desirable. \n\nI know every relationship is different. But I think it's pretty relatable to want to look good for your partner, and to expect that your partner wants to look good for you on some level. That level doesn't have to be (and shouldn't be) that you jump when your partner says, \"jump\"... but it should at minimum be that you're at least willing to hear their feedback, even if you ultimately don't wind up utilizing it.", "I\u2019m not sure it would be noticed to the same extent.

I would propose to you that that\u2019s not universally considered a bad thing. I like a bit of weirdness in the face - crooked tooth, big nose, lazy eye. I know these are conventionally considered to be flaws but I don\u2019t see them that way (it just adds visual interest and uniqueness). On my own face, I don\u2019t seek to minimize what others might perceive as flaws.

Not that I can\u2019t ask for a change in behavior or whatever. But like, okay, so I\u2019m from the northeast. She\u2019s from the south. She loves sequins and animal print and all kinds of things I totally hate. And at first I didn\u2019t realize that she didn\u2019t know I hated them.
