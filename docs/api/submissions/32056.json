When we met, his hair was medium length. He has curls that are to die for. Think Adrian Grenier from Entourage but dirty blonde. \n\nI've always been into beauty and fashion, I even took some cosmetology classes in the past. I'd say I'm pretty hip to what hairstyles go with different face shapes and things like that. My fianc\u00e9 has had to wear his hair a bit shorter for work, which makes sense and it looks fine. He still has a few inches of curls and is really cute! \n\nHowever, about a month ago, while I was out of town, he cut his hair down to less than an inch and took some clippers to the sides and the back in attempt to create a fade. He's never done this before. He couldn't even see the back of his head. My reaction was like of like \"omg what did you do??\" It didn't look terrible but it was a huge change. He is a very attractive man, but he has some larger features and having super short hair accentuates them (no shame in that, I have a long face so I have a fringe and wear my hair in ways that balance things out). Again, it wasn't horrible and he's always going to be attractive to me - but the haircut didn't suit him in my opinion and it was hard for me to hide my shock when I saw it. \n\nBeing a dude who is clueless about beauty and fashion, he didn't see the big deal but recognized that I didn't like it and we kind of laughed it off. He joked about me disliking his short hair. There were no hard feelings, it's just hair. It was clear that I love him no matter what but that I didn't like that haircut. Again, this was a month ago, so it's grown out some and people we haven't seen in a while are still saying \"woah, you cut your hair!\" Just to give you an idea about how drastic it was. \n\nSo today, he mentions that he wants to cut his hair short again and shave his face. I jokingly said \"nooooo!\" Then followed it up with \"haha do what you want to do, I'll love you no matter what but I would be happy if you never used clippers on your hair again.\" He shut down and said \"yikes. Point taken. I have to go.\" \n\nI didn't think this was a sensitive subject, so I was being playful when expressing my dislike for this idea. Maybe I'm just an asshole, but I'm sitting here wondering what kind of reaction he was expecting? Maybe saying \"I'd be happy if you never used clippers again\" was harsh, but I was coming from a playful place. I wouldn't have phrased it like that had I known he was feeling sensitive about it but because we made jokes in the past, it didn't feel wrong to say. \n\nNow I'm wondering if I should have just said nothing & just let him express himself however he wants and I'm putting too much importance on physical appearance? Or if I was ok to express that something isn't exactly a turn on to me? I apologized for coming across too harsh but now I'm doubting myself for even caring in the first place.", "created_utc": 1701360241, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187m02e/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_i_dont_prefer_his_hair/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You expressed your opinion, that's all. You didn't demand he not cut his hair or make threats like you'd leave if he did. Sound like he didn't fully grasp how much you didn't like it though.", "NAH. I think what you said was reasonable, benign, and gently/playfully worded. It's ok to have a preference and to express it. I think his reaction was a bit severe but it probably speaks to him having more serious feelings about this than you've realized. \n\nIf I were you, I would maybe say something like \"Hey I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings in anyway with my comment about the clippers. I think you know I love your curls and facial hair, but if you want to go really short I can support that.\"", "I think you would be the asshole if you continued to do it now that you know he didn\u2019t appreciate your comment.

This guy is a hypocrite.", "INFO: How would you feel if you cut your hair a certain way and liked it, then your fianc\u00e9 made a comment on it? Would you not care or would you be hurt?", "NAH.\n\nThe lesson here is that, whatever you said in a \"playful tone\" when you first saw his hair until today, did not sink in to him as a real comment or a serious preference.  Otherwise he wouldn't have said he was going to cut it again.\n\nIf it mattered to you, then at some point in the last month you should have said to him in all seriousness, \"I would like it if you let your hair grow out the way it was before.\" and maybe follow up by using some of your skills to help him make it look as good as possible while it grows out.\n\nI'm sure if it's grown out a month, it now looks worse than a month ago and not as good as it did before.  So he wanted to make it look better, and you can't grow it out in one day.\n\nMy wife knows I prefer her hair longer.  She grows it out and then wants a change and cuts it short.  But she expects me to notice her new haircut and say \"It looks good!\" every time because there's no point in going over it again.\n\nPerhaps because of that, I can't get her to tell me whether she likes me better with the beard I've been wearing for \"Brovember.\" So I have no idea whether she would be happy or sad if I shave it off tomorrow.", "This sounds like an episode of Schitts Creek lol.\n\nIn healthy relationships you should be able to express yourself freely\u2026 within reason. You have to look at him every day lol so it\u2019s not wrong to have and express an opinion on his hair.\n\nBut at a certain point, he knows. And if he wants to keep it short that\u2019s his prerogative. And if he does, you need to stop bringing it up. He knows, and he is making a choice.\n\nThe last time I went into the salon I mentioned cutting my hair and my husband had a panicked look on his face lol. But he didn\u2019t say anything because he knows that I know what his preference is, but he also knows it\u2019s my hair! He did express joy that I only got a trim later tho lol.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is probably sensitive about it, and you\u2019ll get to a point where you can joke about it.

When he comes back, say: \u201chey, I am sorry about my earlier comment. I definitely was just joking around and thought we were being playful. But I obviously hurt your feelings. So while yes, I do prefer your hair a bit longer, I still find you sexy as hell with short hair. It\u2019s your hair and you\u2019re the one that has to manage it and it\u2019s upkeep.

That\u2019s when it went from a little joke to you really reinforcing that you hate his hairstyle well beyond what is normal.\n\nYou ask what kind of reaction he was expecting. Probably a normal one like \u201cokay cool lmk when you\u2019re ready for the broom\u201d or \u201cdo you need help with the back of your head\u201d or something.", "NTA - he had already set the tone that this was an okay thing to joke about because he had previously joked that he didn't think you liked it. I think it's fair be sensitive about your partner not liking a certain aesthetic choice but it sounds like he also didn't properly communicate that this was something that was sensitive to him.\n\nI think you should apologize for this time and maybe add that if something is bothering him the future, he should let you know in the moment instead of laughing it off, otherwise it is very difficult to be conscience of his feelings.", "YTA.

It's his choice. \n\nBut, I do express my dislike and let him know I like his hair long. It's okay to have preference. It's not okay to force it on others. \n\nYou're not forbidding him, you just expressed your dislike. Nor you're dying on this hill and divorcing him for it.

He still has a few inches of curls and is really cute! \n\nHowever, about a month ago, while I was out of town, he cut his hair down to less than an inch and took some clippers to the sides and the back in attempt to create a fade. He's never done this before. He couldn't even see the back of his head. My reaction was like of like \"omg what did you do??\" It didn't look terrible but it was a huge change. He is a very attractive man, but he has some larger features and having super short hair accentuates them (no shame in that, I have a long face so I have a fringe and wear my hair in ways that balance things out).

As I stated in the post, he shut down and is not on his phone right now.", "That's a weird opinion to have but you do you I guess", "Look at her comments -- he told her he didn't like a shorter cut of hers, and so she grew it out.", "Best of luck!", "Ohhh your hair is sick, I love that hairstyle. I def get what you mean.", "A conversation is probably due to get on the same page. Sometimes, we don\u2019t see things the same way and we say stuff that might hurt the other unintentionally. It happens, and sometimes we can\u2019t do anything to stop this from happening.\n\nHope your talk goes well with him!", "Thank you!"]}
