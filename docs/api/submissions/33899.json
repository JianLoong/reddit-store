Could be something as simple as he watched a video on YouTube that scared him. Could be much deeper than that. I think you should both focus on getting to the root cause of this sudden behaviour change before just kicking him out. \n\nAlso, if you keep bringing up how you read studies that co-sleeping at 6 is bad for the kid, she\u2019s going to get annoyed.

Healthy normal behavior put you off doing something good ?\nWtf", "If the child has diagnosed development and behavioral delays, it was no caused by cosleeping.\n\nBut, if she has diagnosed delays, it would make sense why she might want to cosleep.", "Okay, thanks for the honesty and details. You need to take that \u201cpeer reviewed research\u201d with a massive lump of \u201cWestern Confirmation Bias\u201d salt. The worldwide average age that children cosleep with their parents is 4~6. And that\u2019s without taking into account cultural norms, socioeconomic factors, and simple personal preferences. In Japan, China, Portugal, and Malaysia, for example, kids sleep with their parents until as late as 7 or 8. In Senegal, kids sleep with their parents until they\u2019re teens. \n\nThere is no agreed-upon magic age among child development experts when children should begin sleeping independently. In fact, those experts agree that the emphasis should be on promoting safe and healthy sleep habits, I.e., getting a good, uninterrupted night\u2019s sleep free of stress or anxiety about safety or time constraints, regardless of what age the child eventually moves to their own sleeping space. \n\nMoreover, there is abundant research to indicate extended cosleeping can actually foster stronger parent-child bonds and provide a child with a sense of safety and security, which can further support their overall emotional development. In the case of your GF\u2019s single-mother status, that relationship  and sense of security is more critical for her daughter than ever, and you can be a positive part of it. Or not.\n\nBut you sound like you\u2019re genuinely interested in the wellbeing of the daughter, so I would highly recommend you steer away from this \u201ccosleeping is the problem\u201d rut you find yourself in. I can assure you as a childcare specialist (true story) for 20+ years that emotional and cognitive delays are complicated and among the possible causes, cosleeping is near the very bottom of the list of culprits.\n\nIf the child suddenly started wanting to sleep in the same room with you and your GF, that likely means something happened emotionally for her to make her want to seek out reassurance or security. Figuring out what that is and helping her come to grips with it will produce a better outcome for the child than trying to convince the mom that she needs to make the child go back to her room. So do that together with your GF.\n\nMeanwhile, we still haven\u2019t addressed the \u201cI can\u2019t sleep comfortably with the child in the bed with us\u201d thing. What\u2019s that about? Not enough space? An \u201cicky feeling\u201d? What? Because if you ever intend to have another child with your GF, this will come up again. And you need to deal with it. I\u2019m going to venture a theory and it may be waaay off base, but are you uncomfortable because the child isn\u2019t your own and you subconsciously feel she is an intruder? I can tell you as a parent, having my own kid run into our bedroom in the middle of the night wasn\u2019t an imposition. It\u2019s was a welcome and pleasant reminder that our child loved and need us and we were there to provide  comfort when they needed it. That\u2019s a very short sweet spot as a parent that doesn\u2019t last very long and should be cherished while it still happens.", "Cosleeping does not cause behavioral and developmental delays. It\u2019s more like the opposite, behavioral and developmental delays can result a child cosleeping. I have a child with behavioral and developmental delays. I am also a single parent.

When it was a once every so often thing, I didn't have an issue but every night I have to leave and that has become a problem. \n\nFWIW I have an undergrad in psychology, and while I know that cosleeping in and out of itself, does not cause developmental delays, there is correlation with the behavioral and developmental issues that my girlfriends child has and co sleeping. I know that there are other factors, but this is the one that I'm specifically focusing on for the sake of this Reddit post.\n\nYou seem to genuinely care about the situation I'm in and I appreciate that and if you are open to DM more, I am open for that, \n\nwhat makes me uncomfortable is that is not my biological child and I don't want the biological family accusing me of anything. I know that in these days you can't trust anyone with your children, and I don't want to ever be the center of speculation.\n\nMy girlfriend has told me that she doesn't like it either but it's the only way for her to get sleep.

The issue is that he doesn\u2019t want to sleep in the bed with the child because:\n\nA) he feels uncomfortable doing so (for reasons not yet exlear)\n\nB) he thinks cosleeping at this age stunts emotional/cognitive development.\n\nAs a side note, I\u2019m have a really hard understanding this emphasis you (and other posters) have been placing on this child being \u201csomeone else\u2019s child\u201d which makes sleeping in the same bed somehow understandably \u201cwrong.\u201d Why exactly?", "I agree with most of your post, however, as an female who brought my son into a relationship, my son and his needs ALWAYS came first. My husband was 26, I was 22, and m5 son was 2yrs old, so VERY similar. They still do, even after 15 years of being together and 10 of being married. My kids are my world and I know that the years of me being able to be their safety and their comfort are fast and furiously coming to an end. If that means my 9yr old wants to take a nap in my bed when I get home from work (I work nights and my husband works days), or my 16yr old wanting to lay in our bed and watch a movie (ultimately falling asleep almost always because he says it's like a nest in our bed), then I welcome it. \nMy husband was once my boyfriend and before we moved in with each other I explained that I wasn't one of those parents that wouldn't welcome my son into bed with us. It wasn't weird ever. It was like camping out. Sometimes he slept in the middle wanting to hold our hands, others he just wanted me to be near him and scratch his back. There was a time around 5-7 that this happened a lot and I firmly believe it was because they were overstimulated and just needing to feel peace and safety. \nYou've already been in that girls life for a few years, you're seen as her father figure in her eyes, she feels safe with her mom AND you. If you were gunna be accused of anything, you probably would have by now. Plus  you are forgetting that you can still be accused of shit without having that sleep situation.", "As someone who grew up with parents who \"let him cry it out\" as a child \"to old\" , here's my perspective. This child's have separated. That alone is enough to cause a lot of insecurity.\n\nSpending nights terrified and alone did teach me self reliance though. Maybe I'll mention that on next year's Christmas card.\n\nOw and 'undergrad in psychology ' means 'still have many years of learning and zero clinical experience'.", "I am total open to DMing. Your undergrad studies have got you in the right frame of mind, for sure. It\u2019s a lot better position than many others in a similar situation find themselves in. But I think that\u2019s also an important thing to note, namely that this is t all that unusual a situation. What\u2019s frustrating about this issue is that it invariably will \u2014 and has, as we can already see \u2014 invited the Pedophile Hunter Brigade, who seem intent on finding ill intent in everything and everyone. Ignore them. They view life almost exclusively through the lens of reality TV shows like \u201cTo Catch a Predator\u201d and they are actually contributing to the downfall of society. No, not being hyperbolic. These people\u2019s hyper-vigilant good intentions are part of the problem.\n\nMeanwhile, the simple fact that you\u2019re concerned about accusations of inappropriate contact tell me two things: One, you obviously live in the socially and emotionally fucked up dystopia that is modern America, and two, you\u2019ve got this child\u2019s best interests in mind. I think this means you need to adjust your mindset a little bit to get to the proper mental place to effect the change you\u2019d like to seen that first benefits the child, and then, as a dividend of your investment, benefits your overall relationship with your GF, which in turn provides even great security and stability for the child, which leads to emotional and cognitive growth, and so on and so forth. Think Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy. \n\nThat adjustment means envisioning yourself being in this for the long haul, i.e., eventually marrying your partner and eventually adopting the child to make your current de facto status as step-dad an official one. I\u2019m not saying that responsible child-rearing can\u2019t happen outside of a marriage, but that step can silence the naysayers. Going at this issue from a more committed perspective can answer a lot of questions for you and can possibly help you look at what the child needs more objectively. \n\nI need to reiterate, the child is suddenly coming into the bedroom to cosleep recently for a reason. You and your GF need to work together as a team to figure out what that reason is. That unified approach of empathy and willingness to help her through this phase \u2014 and it is a phase \u2014 will work wonders.", "It\u2019s taken years for my kiddo to get to that point.
