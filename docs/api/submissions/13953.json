Just because she can\u2019t care for her children, and you are her sister, doesn\u2019t mean you can magically do so. Foster care has its problems, yes, but there\u2019s a lot of wonderful adults and families out there too who are prepared, able and willing to care for kids in crisis. It is ok to rely on the systems we put in place for exactly this reason.", "NTA. That is a HUGE ask for someone to make of you. You are totally within your rights to say no. I cannot imagine taking in 3 young children for an unknown amount of time. That would affect every single aspect of your life. You are totally not any kind of wrong by saying no. And just say no. No is a complete sentence. No cannot be argued with. No cannot be manipulated. No is no. You got this.", "NTA. You already decided it's not a good idea for you to have kids. You don't have any experience with it or the money and mental bandwidth to start taking care of them. It's not fair for you to quit your job and upend your life for this.", "NTA. You are NEVER an AH for saing no to taking care of someone else's children. No explanations are needed. \"No\" is a complete sentence.", "NTA, and I\u2019m not even certain you would qualify as a placement. The situation you\u2019re describing might not meet the guidelines for kinship foster care. \n\nCrossing yourself off the list is the best and healthiest thing you currently have to offer your sister\u2019s kids. Taking care of children is difficult. Taking care of children you don\u2019t want is even harder. And doing it without any of the resentment seeping out is nearly impossible.", "NTA - You know your limitations. As much as you care about your nieces and nephew, you have to take care of yourself first.", "NTA and you're not wrong. What you described is either moving away from your life for no guarantee of anything come or stay where you are financially and emotionally stable. It is heartbreaking that these children face that in their lives. I prayed that they find a good situation for them. But this is not your situation. If you wanted them with you, that's one thing, maybe there are state resources where you live that might help you with fostering. But it doesn't sound like that's the right choice. You should take care of you.", "NTA\n\nOnly you know if you\u2019re equipped to raise children. It is not your responsibility to clean up this mess for her.", "NTA. You just had surgery, so you aren't in any physical shape to care for small children. And though it might sound selfish to them, you have a life of your own that doesn't involve children. Literally in your case. You also are also just getting by financially. Free rent isn't worth it if these children impact your mental health. Tell them NO. You are childless by choice. They have to figure out their own circus & monkeys.", "NTA.\n\nHer kids are her problem. They are not your problem. How often on this site do we find relatives trying to guilt or trick or cajole various OPs into taking care of their children?\n\nYou have a life to lead that does not include bowing to your sister's demands. She is the author of her life; let her decide what to do in the next chapter.\n\nDon't talk to her or others about it anymore. No is the answer, goodbye.", "NAH. It's understandable why she would ask. It's fine if you don't want to do it.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYou don't have the money, time, energy, or even a great bond with them. You just are not able to.", "NTA\n\nBut why would neither parent have custody?  That seems unusual.", "NTA. Her choices led here to her current situation. If you can do it you can't do it. This is not your responsibility.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t decide to have this kids so is not your responsibility to take them. Also you don\u2019t feel prepared to take care of them (I wouldn\u2019t either)so that would only add more stress to you.", "NTA you need to put yourself first here and that\u2019s perfectly fine. You are not obligated to help.", "NTA. Don't take those kids. If you can barely keep yourself above water, how are you supposed to do that with 3 kids?", "NTA\n\nJust the logistics of this are impossible.\n\nYou would have to quit your job and move.\n\nEven with free rent you would need to get a job to pay for food and utilities and diapers and everything else. Including daycare for the 2 year old and some sort of after school care for the older two.\n\nI just don\u2019t see how this could possibly work out financially.\n\nAnd then there are all the other issues involved.\n\nYou have to say no to protect your self.", ">barely making it check- to-check on $14/hr\n\nYou can't afford it.

A two bedroom is also grossly insufficient for three kids, even if you were able.\n\nYou made a decision about being a parent and you deserve to have that honoured.\n\nI hope your sister's kids are very lucky, as the foster system is extremely flawed, but in no way is their situation your fault.  Their parents are the ones who failed here.", "NAH. Your personal situation doesn't sound ideal for one child, let alone three. It's completely understandable that your sister would ask, and it's completely understandable that you would say no. Hopefully there's enough of a relationship between your sister and your other siblings that she'll turn to them. It would be easiest on the kids if they could stay in the area with family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
