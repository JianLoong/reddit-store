She isn't a puppy you can just write off when it's convenient... most of us wouldn't even do that to a puppy. If she were your biological child, would you just send her away because it was convenient? I would hope not. You figure out how to make things work for the ones we love. That being said, if you're struggling and this isn't just a matter of convenience, if there's PPD or similar factors at work for you make sure your husband is aware of the seriousness of that situation.

Is there way you can make a 'safe' place for her, where she can go and close herself off from the rest of the world? maybe you should talk about this with your husband, her therapist, her mother and see how you are going to deal with your concerns.

If you are asking this now, you may as well leave. If you know in your heart that there is no room in it for a kid with special needs, stop wasting everyone's time and get a divorce. Otherwise, talk to your husband and figure out what's best for the kids. If you can't have this conversation with him, then you have another marker of incompatibility. You either have enough love for these people to work with them, or you don't.", "YWBTA and you\u2019re even more TAH for waiting until a week before your step-daughter is to arrive before even thinking about bringing this up..\n\nPlus there are things that you don\u2019t say that make me suspicious of your motives.

You married this man, knowing all about the custody arrangements, and you were fine with it until last minute.\n\nAnd now your solution is to just get rid of the older kid entirely, indefinitely, since your child will likely not stop screaming until he\u2019s five at least. Yeah. YTA. \n\nHave you actually spent any time with Marie, or is this literally the first year ? That would only make it worse.", "YWBTA, he's her father and he has a responsibility to her just as much as to your son. You don't get to just decide she's too inconvenient for your life and get rid of her. If your heart isn't big enough to welcome her you shouldn't have married her father. Instead of asking to not bring her over you should be asking for help if you feel overwhelmed. Maybe a family member or babysitter can be there too to help assist so that both children are getting their needs met", "YTA.

Horrible.", "No, OP, it's perfectly reasonable for you to ask your husband to give up his daughter for his new, less disabled family. If he agrees with you and abandons his daughter and his custody obligations, you can rest assured that there is a 100% chance that your child will never suffer any hardships and become inconvenient to his family, so if you two ever divorce, he wouldn't get abandoned either.", "YTA.

If your husband can work from home for a bit or take vacation to help out with the transition period. Look into any avenues to make it easier on Marie.

It's very challenging to provide care in that circumstance. That being said, yes YTA. The child isn't a surprise. I suppose you could have preemptively said you wouldn't care for her before you got married, which would be slightly different but still pretty shitty in my book.", "YTA - I assume you knew of Maria prior to marrying your husband.

Which means that both the conception, and like 8 out of 9 months of pregnancy, took place with daughter living with OP and her husband.\n\nOP hasn't answered any questions or left any comments about previous arrangements, so we don't know what they were.  But at minimum OP would've been *extremely aware* that this was coming for... well, at least 18 months.  When they found out OP was pregnant they presumably discussed the maternity/paternity leave arrangements, whether OP would be a SAHP or go back to work or if her husband would, and the cost of making all those things happen and whether any existing childcare arrangements would still be affordable on a single income. \n\nSo regardless of what arrangement they had before I'll still just OP as YTA because of the *timing* of this.  She had 18 months to consider how this would work and discuss it with her husband and make arrangements.  This situation is not a surprise and has not been dropped on her.  But if the daughter has intellectual disabilities that make change and transitions hard enough to benefit more from a *year-long custody arrangement* then it's highly likely the daughter has been getting prepared by her mother and any other carers for the transition to her father's house for weeks now.  It *will* be an extremely last minute and difficult change for the daughter and her mother, and an entirely avoidable one if OP had brought this up before.", "Whatever he did before he got married.

If that's true then at best this is an ESH situation since they both are adults and should have discussed it.

It will also could be very isolating for OP and Adam. If OP dosen't feel capable of leaving the home with both kids and caring for both in public (pretty safe bet since she dosen't even feel capable of caring for both at home) she'll basically be trapped at home all of the time with high needs children who are setting each other off and everyone is cooped up and miserable. \n\nWhat did husband do to take care of his daughter before he married OP?

OP was obviously pregnant the last time Marie was with them. She hasn't said she doesn't like Marie, or that she \"just doesn't want Marie around\". She's acknowledged that Marie has sensory difficulties, and that this time there's an infant in the home (who wasn't there last time) who is currently going through a phase (crying/screaming) that will cause Marie harm due to said sensory difficulties. She's also acknowledged that her husband is working a lot, which means that she will be home alone, dealing with an infant who is screaming (which is hard and stessful at the best of times), as well as the added stress of caring for another child who will (in all likelihood) be experiencing noise-related sensory overload. A child who deserves to also have *her* needs met and to feel safe in her home. \n\nOP isn't an AH, she's just caught between a rock and a hard place. It's impossible to know what your baby will be like (some babies are super chill and happy most of the time, whilst others are the exact opposite). In OP's case it sounds like this current phase of irritability is somewhat recent (which can happen with developmental leaps, and there's one at around a year old), so I'm going to give them a bit of grace for not having prepared for this scenario earlier.\n\nOP needs helpful solutions, not judgement. Husband needs to step up and problem solve with both OP and his ex to find a solution that is in Marie's best interests. e.g. delay the move for 6 months if that's something that the ex can work with, at which point it's possible/likely that Adam will have gotten through this current phase and they can all enjoy being together without Marie (or OP) feeling as overwhelmed.

The dad is to blame here.", "Or he was never clear that she would be the full time carer. He is her dad op isn't the primary parent. Marie already has 2.", "You don't know that. Maybe it was dropped on her. Maybe she was never told she  would be full time carer.  So she didn't know to address it before. \n\nThis is his child and his responsibility", "As a special educator I am wondering why the child isn\u2019t in school.  Having severe disabilities, she\u2019s entitled to an education until she\u2019s 21.", "Correct. What did he do for child care before. I think she unfortunately would be the A-hole though because she knew all of this before they had a baby. I understand her concerns but she's the A-hole. YTA.", "Who said he wasn\u2019t willing to do it? She said he has to go to work. I assume they discussed how childcare would work during his custody time at some point before now. Why did OP marry and have a kid with him if she was opposed? \n\nAlternatively, she could offer to let her husband be a stay at home dad for a year? Perhaps that would be a better arrangement?", "OP says she would be providing care while her husband is at work.  Going to work to support the household is hardly \"dumping\".", "Did she ever say she would do it? Did he ever sit her down and say I expect you to be 100% full time mom while she's here every other year. \n\nMaybe not. So she is not the ass for being honest about what she can and cannot handle.", "1) she may not have planned to be a  sahm mom when she married. I know a lot of women that had to be sahm after they couldn't find affordable childcare. It's not lack of planning, infant daycare waiting lists are literally years long.\n2) she may not have realized how much work an 11 month old is. I didn't know this until I had one\n3) she mentions he's going through a very fussy time now. That's a lot to deal with and would not have been predictable.\n\nMaybe she needs help, maybe they can't afford help. But I don't blame her for being stressed about what's coming.", "Yes THEY should make a plan for the girl's care.\n\nOP isn't just being mean spirited, she's honestly saying she dosen't feel capable of looking after both of their needs all day alone. And that step-daughter is hurt/upset by noise while baby is currently screaming a lot, so this situation is going to be bad for step-daughter. \n\nWhat country do they live in? Can Marianne go to school and get special education services? What did husband do when he worked before marrying OP?", "Presumably he did that before he married the OP?

He\u2019s a great dad and he deserves equal time with our son, no matter how shitty of a husband he was.  My son deserves the same amount of time with his dad to build a real relationship and bond with his father.  My feelings about my ex husband as a partner should not influence my son\u2019s feelings and relationship with his dad.  We agreed immediately when we decided to divorce that our son would never be used as a pawn to hurt each other", "It\u2019s not on her alone, they should have discussed this before getting married at all.", "Because her solution is pretty evil.\n\nYes, he should have initiated a care plan. She also should have asked what they were going to do regarding her care before getting married.\n\nIt is not on her alone that they don\u2019t have a plan, but the solution she is offering is fucked up", "Perhaps her assumption was that whatever arrangement the working father had in the past with regard to care would continue and has only just been informed that Dad expects her to care for both children.", "I'd imagine that that could make things worse, though. Each year she goes to a parent who isn't familiar with her routine or any developmental adjustments or changes she's been going through, and she has to adapt to a whole new environment with people it sounds like she hasn't really been around for a year? That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.", "It could also be that Marie has such severe cognitive delays and  limited mobility and ability to care for herself that keeping the switching to a minimum does not cause her any emotional distress and is the safest in terms of consistency of care, exposure to illness, etc. Or having her there for that length of time allows her to qualify for home services she might not qualify for if she switches homes more frequently. For instance, maybe she could only get nursing services for a primary home but not a secondary location for weekends and whatnot. hard to say off the information provided", "It's probably a factor that the girl is likely not in a regular school", "What? That's a jump. We know nothing about the mother other than the fact she's looked after her daughter for 51 weeks straight. She may not even want her daughter to relocate to her father's place next week.", "I think that's fair, but I think OP's at fault for only raising this concern now, a week before she gets here, when it sounds like she and her husband were both aware that the plan would be for her to stay home with the daughter and the baby well in advance.\n\nAll that being said, casting blame isn't helpful right now, and they need to work together to find solutions.", "Very well said \ud83d\udc4f. That's what I tried to say too, but quite awkwardly. The OP didn't understand the conundrum until she was just recently presented with it. She really does need to speak up and hopefully she did. The dad and mom, and possibly the stepmother who presumably be the major care giver need talk to each other without shaming her, so that extra care is available when the older child is in their home, whether it's dad, or perhaps an extra sitter. Maybe it doesn't have to over complicated.", "she's definely YTA. She\u2019s known for a whole year this was going to happen and she\u2019s left it to the last week.\n\nThere's no concern about taking care....where did you read that? \n\nShe's only suggesting that the child NOT enter his home! That's totally unacceptable. Why marry a man with a special needs child\n\nOP has no concern about living arrangements or childcare. Please read story again. If she did care for the well-being of the child, logically her and husband would have discussed any arrangements.", "Why is the ex-wife expected to take responsibility for helping OP figure this out? Ex-wife will have just completed *her year* - now it's OP and daddy's turn.", "First of all OP is the AH for the proposed solution of \u201cdon\u2019t bring the step daughter\u201d. Obviously OP and her husband needs to find a more realistic solution to make sure that step daughter is able to exist comfortably. I have to wonder how trying this year on year off arrangement will be for step daughter, since I can imagine upending her routine will be super detrimental for the step daughter as well.\n\nHaving said that, 6 months ago the now 11 month old baby was not going through a \u201cfussy\u201d phase with lots of crying that would overload the  step daughter, so it\u2019s kind of understandable that this issue is coming up now as the baby has recently become fussy with lots of crying", "I suspect he hired a nurse. Caring for a severely disabled child generally precludes working. It\u2019s a full time job all on its own.", "Maybe she didn't ever expect she would be full caretaker and only now he is saying she will be.\n\nY'all are so cruel. She should have this and this but not the kids biological parent.  They get by with bare minimum", "She's legally required to receive some form of schooling. But it might be at home services, or part day, or honestly even a disabled child in school full time comes w a lot of other challenges like lots of doctors appointments, medication, counseling appointments.", "God you really are making a lot of insinutations without any explicit context just to paint the guy as a deadbeat. For all you know he could have asked her and she said yes she can do it and now she is having second thoughts. She hasn't even mentioned anything about him being against her having support, its possibly just a conversation that hasn't been raised. All you want is the man to be trash for wanting to have his daughter in his life and honor his custody agreement, something she would have 100% known about if they've been together long enough to be married.", "My guess is the ex doesn\u2019t work either, hence the request.  Otherwise, wouldn\u2019t the nurse the girl is accustomed to be coming with her either way?  That has been my experience with at home care. This reeks of taking advantage.", "Get your shit together lady. You have to put your big girl pants on and figure out how to take care of both kids. If this is an issue, you should have thought about that before getting pregnant with Adam. If you can afford it get extra help. \n\nYWBTA. \n\nI don't get all these weird parenting arrangements where kids are away from one their parents for a months or a YEAR. Like being uprooted and away from her other parent for a year is going to be good for this girl that already has challenges.", "I agree that it shouldn\u2019t all fall on her, but she is a SAHM, so her husband has no choice but to work, and with only having one income, they might not be able to afford childcare. \n\nHonestly, depending on what OP\u2019s credentials are, they might be better off switching places, and having OP work and her husband being a SAHD.", "I hope OP realises that if Marie\u2019s mom ends up having sole custody, she has every right to request more child support to cover the practically doubled cost of childcare, and OP might have to go back to work and put the golden child in daycare.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Even worse. She figured if they had a new baby together he would stop wanting to ever see Marie completely. Getting rid of that problem entirely.\n\nOnly it backfired and unlike a lot of parents who bail when they find out their kid has a mental disability, OP's husband is a stand up guy who cares about his daughter even with all of the hardship it is going to bring him in his life.\n\nOP (Literally in this case) Fucked around and found out.", "I am going to disagree. When you marry a parent, the kids are part of the deal. Her husband is going to work, not partying. This is what a normal relationship would look like. If she was not willing to accept this, she should have brought it up earlier. \n\nShe came into the situation, not the other way around.", "It really is not. When you marry a man with children, they are part of the package. If she has an issue taking care if 2 kids at the same time, she should ask for help.", "Did you just really say that OP's husband's child coming to LIVE with her father in HIS house is dumping his daughter on OP? It's his daughters house too, but ok, he should never have anything to do with her again.", " If I had a puppy and If someone I was in a relationship said \"It's either me or the puppy\" I'd tell the SO to pack her shit and be gone.", "My big issue with OP is that she\u2019s had 11 months to figure something out. She could have said a few months ago \u201chaving a baby is a lot more overwhelming than I expected, I\u2019m not sure I can be a SAHM to both of them\u201d, and given her husband and his ex plenty of notice to figure something out.", "That\u2019s not really how it works when both parents are still alive and in the child\u2019s life. The parents are the ones who parent and provide for the child. \n\nWhat was dad\u2019s childcare plan before he married OP and why has that plan since been canceled? Being a step parent doesn\u2019t mean being an unpaid nanny.", "I have an infant. I understand. But going into a marriage knowing this aspect and also knowing you want your own kid, coupled with knowing what the financial situation looks like and likely cost of specialized care (my partner works in this field), you chose to proceed with getting married. Have a kid. And then proceed to penalize a child and her important bond with her father? It\u2019s clear by the age of the child, this isn\u2019t a couple that got married straight out of college; they got married as grown ass adults with full knowledge and understanding. If her first child was special needs and the second came along, would she want to get rid of the first?", "A very known custody agreement that OP had a year to plan for. This kid didn't show up unexpectedly on their doorstep, with a DNA test and a court ordered custody agreement pinned to her shirt. OP knew for a year that this was coming and waited 51/52nds of it before raising objections.", "Why did he marry her if he couldn\u2019t attend o all his daughters needs?\n\nWhy did he have another child?", "Yes! When you are with someone who has kids (especially when you are married) they become your kids. Marie coming for the planned time isn\u2019t a surprise and she shouldn\u2019t be asking husband to pick between the kids. That is her being an immediate asshole. If she needs help, hire someone. She is her stepmom and should be helping to care for Marie just like the husband takes care of their kid. YTA", "If she is mentally disabled it\u2019s better for her to not constantly have her daily routines disrupted.", "And OP had no idea about this plan until now?  I don't believe that.  If her husband just sprung this plan on her suddently, she would have said so.  They've had a *year* to plan for this.\n\nAlso, at age 11 Marie should be attending school, so it's not like OP has to supervise her 24/7.", "But she hasn't said she ever expected nor was told she would be full time carer. \n\nShe may only be now looking at it as she sees her husband has no plan.  Just her.", "But it isn't as if Marie was sprung on her after the wedding. She chose this family, and I can't imagine that OP wasn't hoping her husband would choose the new baby over his daughter all along.", "Do we know the age of the couple? \n\nShe is a first time mother and I know as a first time mother I had no idea what it would be like. I had no idea how little sleep for so long I would have and I was as 37. You think you will have more energy than you will have and there is a thing called magical thinking. \n\nYour response doesn\u2019t help anyone. She is going to burn out if she doesn\u2019t get help. I know people who have had special needs children and they need A LOT OF SUPPORT. Are you asking her to put her baby in danger so she can care for a child she is complaining I\u2019ll-equipped to have. No one is talking about the dad. He wasn\u2019t careful about who he married to take care of his child. He doesn\u2019t seem to care if she is no up to the task. I know parents who have birth children  with special needs, who have more resources who were near breaking point. They needed Nannies, professionals, and help from friends and family. \n\nShe is realizing that she got herself in deep because if you were not raised around children you do not know. \n\nYour advise doesn\u2019t help the child you seem to care about. How does she get through this by herself because it looks like she is by herself. How is she going to get sleep to take care of two difficult children? \n\nNo one seems to care about the well being of the mother.", "The man has to work? To provide for his family financially since she isn't? \"Something he is not willing to do\" is pure bull. Should he just quit his job and they end up on the street?\n\nHer reservations are understandable and there is definitely a conversation to be had about issues with capacity and the complexities that'll come about with having her there (thus figuring out a plan to deal with that). But to insinuate some level of selfishness or negligence on the father's part because he has to work but also wants his daughter around his home and in his life is so rude. \n\nWhat is also rude is just straight up going \"i don't want you to bring your daughter to our house\".", "What are you talking about?.. The father has been sharing custody of the child since forever so HE HAS been willing to take care of his daughter. \nIts just that... Its impossible to take care of his daughter during the hours he has to work obviously..\nHe's not dumping his child on his wife. He is expecting his wife to look over his child like she would their own because that's what she agreed to marry into...", "Still wrong of OP to decide at this point that she does not want the daughter around. There is a custody agreement, I bet OP knew of the custody agreement looong before she decided to marry her husband. \nThe adult thing she should have done is speak to her husband about arranging a carer for her SD rather than decide at the last moment that they should abscond from the agreement.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not willing to do for his daughter\u201d? How do you know that? You know, there\u2019s an adult way of dealing with things like this rather than immediately assuming the role of being the inconvenienced victim because a child has been dumped in your care. You get into an adult relationship like marriage, you better get yourself ready to make adult decisions too.", "Is this kid not in school?", "She has no responsibility to a kid not biologically hers.\n\nHer parents need to raise her, while op is a friendly adult. \n\nShe never signed up to be sole carer for her. \n\nMisogamy running rampant, woman has to be caretaker.", "Because why assume he doesn't care for his daughter? He works. Is he supposed to quit his job and they all live on the streets instead?", "See I don\u2019t see that. She\u2019s probably had her with them before.

She knows about the daughter and previously lived with her. She waited until the last moment to say she doesn't want to take care of her.", "Not to mention OP may have thought that it was feasible BEFORE the 11 month old entered a fussy stage. Dealing with the screaming baby and realizing that Marie would be overstimulated by it if it's going on constantly might not have been something she necessarily accounted for. And I think her phrasing is getting everyone up in a twist when this poor woman is caught in a rock and a hard place with a baby and child who is mentally disabled. She's not trying to be malicious but she's probably sleep deprived and not wording things correctly but she does seem to care for Marie because she's worried about her getting overstimulated and having an issue with the environment. This would probably have been better geared toward an advice sub because everyone is ripping into her when this woman honestly just seems like she's trying to ask for advice and find a solution.", "Oh, her solution is completely wrong. She\u2019s definitely TA for that suggestion.", "This isn't about how difficult it is. Everyone knows it is difficult. Some people can do it, some cannot. No shame in either choice. The shame is in pretending to be okay with the arrangement until last minute, letting someone build their life on the assumption that OP would be a caregiver. It is entirely possible OPs husband would never have had children with OP if he had known he would be facing this. OP took that choice from him and that is extremely selfish.", "I think it is likely. Having gone through the torture of establishing disability-related services for my child and getting the right school placement, I can say it's not something you can do every year anew for a disabled child. It takes a long time with doctors and lawyers, and the school district. And it's not something you want to do more than once, let alone every year. All of that tells me they're all living in the same school district so services stay the same.", "Yikes. ESH. Your husband has a child with severe disabilities and a baby and his solution is\u2026nothing? You take care of it all? Your solution is\u2026she just doesn\u2019t stay? Have you thought about a nanny? Does she go to school? Do you qualify for respite? Was none of this talked about when you were dating? My husband has a disabled sister that his mom expects will never be in a care facility. We talk all the time about what will happen when his mom passes. We also are on the same page. Why didn\u2019t you do any of this?", "And either she doesn't speak English as a first language or she's being really unclear.  Bring his daughter over ... from another country?  From the house down the block?  She means, I guess, bring his daughter her to do her 1 year sentence at this house.  I don't see how a court thought making a child with mental disabilities move home every year was a good plan for her.  I guess that is what it is for now.", "Babies are always going to be going through phases, that's kinda their jam. And then you get the noise and mess machines that are toddlers, and the tiny opinion monsters of preschoolers... Kids by their nature are loud and messy and unpredictable. But when there is another, high needs, kid involved you can't just ignore it, you have to future plan. You have to run scenarios, and set up supports, and figure out what life looks like. And 95% of that is on the husband, this was his job, but she also actively ignored the situation."]}
