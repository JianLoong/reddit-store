I too have a former popular girl mom; cheerleader homecoming court, etc. Not a mean girl (i don\u2019t think) but everything is kind of about her/her feelings. \nI Was an unpopular art school kid/dork.

Maybe you could have handled it better but that is NOT how anyone at ANY age should be behaving at an event, wtf.", "NTA. An adult making fun of young people at an award ceremony is just so immature and disrespectful. The fact that people were turning around and glaring at her is very cringey, clearly she was causing a disturbance.", "NTA for calling out her bullying behavior towards others, but, you could have done it privately to save her the public shaming.", "Definitely NTA. If your mother wants to behave like that in public, then she deserves to be embarassed in public.", "NTA you have a huge pair of balls btw", "ESH. If the petty comments were whispered to you, maybe she said them to make you feel better about losing the reward. She may have even thought you\u2019d find her comments funny and you could bond over her \u201cjokes\u201d (mean girl mentality).

It also sounds like your mom is still a mean girl, which is shorthand for insecure and offensive.", "YTA- a lot of better ways you could have handled the situation without escalating.", "Pretty sure my mom would've slapped the shit out of me, but sounds like your mom needed to hear it. ESH, because there's better ways to get through to people. But also, I've been there, though. You live and ya learn.", "I think the only reason I was able to say that to her is because I was in shock. She had never displayed that kind of behavior in front of me before, idk what made her do it then.", "I can't say for certain whether or not other people heard her but I did notice that some people were looking back at her with not so pleasant looks.", "I didnt purposely mean for other people to hear me, that was not intentional. There multiple rewards, I won 3 of them myself. Based on the look some other parents were giving her I think they could hear her.", "Okay I understand the ESH, and tbh that's the one I agree with. I don't understand the dwelling on high school experiences part, Outside of the occasional story I tell from high school (which is very rare because theres not many good stories to tell) I really don't think about highschool at all. I've completely moved on from it. My friend (who's probably reading this) is the one who brought up highschool stories, not me.", "Probably being in that environment again.     \n\n\nI had to take a civil service exam years ago and got assigned to my old high school to take it.  I didn't even think about it, but when I got there, I went to my old favorite spot and sat on my favorite bench, with my bag between my feet just like I did every day of my senior year while waiting for the doors to open, to wait for the doors to open.  The only difference was I was reading from my smartphone instead of from a paperback book.", "Regression.", "So they definitely heard her. I'd try to avoid situations like this with her in the future.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA she made her remarks in public, she can deal with the fallout in public as well.", "What you said NTA. making a scene? Maybe but leaning more towards no", "My mum was sporty, popular, and head girl and I hung in the art department with my arty friends or the Latin club with my smart friends without being either arty or getting good grades. It still colours how we relate to each other.", "Nope. She said those awful things in public,  she deserves to be shamed in public.

I'm not going to apologize because in my mind still she fucking deserved it.\n2. I'm convinced you people have no reading comprehension skills. I don't dwell on it, as I stated in the post a friend and I were exchanging highschool stories and she called me an asshole, that's the whole reason I posted it here.", "If you\u2019re not dwelling on it and are so convinced that you\u2019re not in the wrong, why even make a post about it? Also, you can apologize for the way you acted even if the other person was also in the wrong. It\u2019s called empathy.", "I posted it here because my friend called me an asshole for it and I disagreed, so I posted on here for some other people to weigh in. Also nah, I'm a big believer of you get what you give. In this situation I believe she deserved no empathy, not in general but for this situation specificly.", "Out of curiosity, did your mom ever behave this way again after you called her out on it?\n\nNTA, although I understand the E S H votes as well and think they're valid. You could have called her out in a more productive way; cursing and name calling isn't exactly healthy communication. Personally, I would have tried to stop her while she was indulging in the bad behavior, especially since other parents were noticing and giving her dirty looks - a quickly whispered \"Please stop insulting my classmates\" hopefully would have sufficed.", "ESH. Your mum was acting like a child. Your friend is right, though, deal with family matters in private where you can. If you wanted to stop her in the moment, a \u201cmom, please stop, these are my friends\u201d should have been enough. Using the f word to your mom and calling her a bitch was unnecessary, although I get that you felt provoked.", "NTA, your dad and aunt were absolutely correct. She was the mean girl in high school. Hell, she still in the mean girl who\u2019s stuck in high school.", "Idk, I don't really talk to my mom for a couple of reasons. According to my younger brother he didn't hear her say anything negative during his.", "Funny, I was in Latin club too, I forget about Latin club.", "I fully agree that you get what you give. If you don\u2019t give your mom (or others) empathy, then you expect none."]}
