Every child gets to have some boundaries, no matter the age.  (Obviously, those boundaries shift over time.)  Your SM isn\u2019t fixing the relationship, she\u2019s ending it. \n\nWhat\u2019s up with your father? If he doesn\u2019t want this to happen, why is he letting it? He should be the primary decision maker on this, not her.  He\u2019s trying to avoid being the bad guy, shame on him. He\u2019s trying to make sure you don\u2019t blame him, AND not argue with his wife. \n\nHere\u2019s the hard question for you.  Give it a few months. Are you happier with your sister and BIL? Do you want to stay there?  If the answer is yes, maybe consider having your sister advocate for keeping you there.

How old were you when she married your dad.  Is your Bio-Mom still around?\n\nI think sending you out of state wasn't the answer.", "NTA. This will never get better unless your dad divorces, and that would take far more strength and love than he has.  He doesn't love you, and your stepmother despises you.  He will always put her above you, and she will always despise you. There is nothing you can do to change this, and the more you try, the worse it becomes.\n\nBut you're just a kid, and you can have a wonderful life. But you can't keep investing in disaster. Go NC with your stepmother and dad, and anyone else who tries to drag you into the delusion that you have a loving family. You don't, but you can build a life surrounded by loving people. \n\nSet your sites on the future you want and only take steps toward that future. Nothing you stepmother has to offer will lead you there.  Nothing your father has to offer, while he's with stepmother, can lead you there.  They are roadblocks to a good life.  Learn how to quickly identify these roadblocks and express your intention to waste no time on them at all. Dismiss them and move on.  \n\nMove on to what? I don't know. But I do know that committing to a future tends to help you notice the paths that might lead there.  \n\nAs a personal strategy, document every way you stepmother and father have compromised you life, in even the smallest or seemingly insignificant way. At best, it's something you can share to help others to understand, but it's real value is in helping you to keep focused on the truth when your father is gaslighting you about how you're exaggerating things and how stepmother is just trying to help.\n\nRemember this whenever you're dealing with your stepmother.  She despises you. She will always despise you. You cannot trust her in any way, about anything. \n\nBut you can use them both to help shape your future.  Use their money and resources as much as you can to get education and experience to build your life. Analyze your relationship with both parents to find your power. Does your stepmother value her image as the loving stepmother? Threaten that image.  Does your father value his image as the loving dad? Threaten that.  This is a complicated dynamic, so tread carefully.  Get therapy, but shop around for a therapist that gets you. Any therapist that minimizes your parents' actions cannot help you.", "Where is your mom OP", "NTA.  What is there to talk about?  She kicked you out of your home WITH your father's permission.  They can both kick rocks.  How is banning you from your home supposed to \"fix\"anything?  She got what she wanted, you out of her life.  So you should ask your father why she isn't happy now.   She got rid of you, you are no longer in her house, what else does she want from you?  Just work on you.  Get your ducks in a row, so you can just leave altogether when you get old enough and let them have each other.", "NTA. She's not trying to \"fix\" anything. She married a man with a child, and she pushed for the child to be removed from the household. That's one of the worst moves a step parent can make. Also, her idea that she deserves respect while you are not is wrong and twisted. Respect is built on a basis of reciprocity. If she doesn't respect you (to the point of removing you from your dad's home!), she doesn't deserve to be treated with any respect or care. You aren't obligated to maintain communication with the stepmother who sent you away from your home. I'm very sorry you are going through this and that the adults in your life are failing you.", "NTA\n\nEven if you were still actively a bad kid, you don't punish a bad kid over inconsequential things. So her behavior still wouldn't make sense. \n\nIf she wanted to improve your relationship, there are several steps that could have been taken that didn't involve sending you away, such as family therapy. \n\nI'm also confused... She's sending you away because you didn't spend enough time with her? So she needs a break, meaning you'll spend less time together....But is also mad you're not virtually spending time with her? None of this makes sense. \n\nFinally, expecting you to leave for half of an academic year is a good way to mess up your education, so she's double TA for that.", "NTA why don't you see if you can stay at your sisters after the 5 m9nths", "NTA \n\nRefuse to speak to her or your dad. He is just as culpable. Even if you move back, don\u2019t acknowledge her at all.", "NTA.  You poor thing.  Your SM and dad are big AHs.  If I were you, I'd never speak to either of them ever again.", "NTA! If things are good with living with your sister, then I'd stick it too them and continue not to call or text--but that's just me. If you want to go back to Texas I'm afraid I agree with the other responder who said you'll have to suck it up and grovel to step mom. Which sucks, but that is what it comes down to. I don't know how old you are but start saving money for when you are 18 so you can live un-beholden to anyone.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry to say this but she isn't fixing anything, she 'eliminated' the problem by sending you away.  \nAnd I'm even sorrier to say this, your dad is the AH for allowing her to do this. You are his child, his responsibility & he's blowing it.\n\nEdited to add: children/teens also deserve respect, never & I mean NEVER let anyone tell you otherwise.", "Wait, so she wants space from you but also wants to hear from you? She can\u2019t have her cake and eat it too. NTA", "NTA.  The way you make family relationship problems/child behavior problems better is through a therapist, not shipping a kid off to another state  Your stepmother is a grown-up and knows this.  She doesn't want to take responsibility for her own actions, that is why you got kicked out.  Your family problems will never work out until everyone takes responsibility and gives a genuine effort with a qualified therapist.", "NTA but at this point maybe you should stay and finish high school with your sister if you like living with her.", "NTA  And I wouldn't be going back.  I would block her on everything. If she wants to communicate with you she can do it through your dad.", "NTA.  If OP gets along well with his sister, he might want to Google - Emancipation.\n\nIt's a rather extreme option but sometimes extreme situations call for extreme solutions.\n\nBest of luck.", "Question? Are u happier in Utah? Are you and your sister okay with each other.. your NTA and the fact that your dad allow her to kick you out to \u201cfix\u201d the relationship speak volume of how toxic they are.. they are probably mad because they though you would be unhappy and wanted you to beg them to take you back. OP do what\u2019s best for you and your mental health. If your doing good then forget them.

But the seeming discrepency makes me wonder if there's more info thats being left out.", "NTA. WTF? How exactly did she think that decision would go? She doesn\u2019t want to learn how to be a proper parent so she just ships you off? And your father is so whipped he let it happen? They\u2019ll be lucky if you ever decide to speak to them again. If you have the ability to do so maybe talk with a therapist, this is a lot for you to be dealing with as a teen. And maybe you can make that a condition for them as well if they have a desire to continue a relationship with you.", "NTA. But your anger is directed against the wrong person. Your father is a spineless AH who sent his child away because that was easier than telling his wife to cut it out. Personally, I would go NC with him too because he is a terrible parent who throws his child and wife under the bus to pretend he is a good guy when he is worse than his wife. He is your father and should be looking out for you.", "NTA. But you are hurt.
