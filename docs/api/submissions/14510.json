{"id": 14510, "submission_id": "12i44ui", "title": "AITA for letting my aunt know how annoying her teenage daughters are during Easter dinner?", "selftext": "\nMy aunt\u2019s two daughters, Ana and Elsa, kept moving around the family after aunt\u2019s divorce because their dad only wanted them if they committed to becoming lawyers and aunt didn\u2019t have a place of her own. The sisters lived one month with an aunt or cousin, were kicked out, relocated to another family member, and repeat. \n\nWhen they turned 15 and 16, my aunt asked if the girls could stay with us for a few days. Which then turned into weeks. And then into almost a year. My mom took them in as if they were her daughters. She took them to concerts, helped with homework, and talked to them when they needed.\n\nBut they were teenagers, who felt rejected by everyone and acted out a lot. Ana washed her panties in the sink and dried them in the microwave. They burned all our dish cloths. They annoyed me (9) and my brother (2) to no end. We had only one computer for the entire house. My mom made a schedule and we each had an hour. Ana and Elsa didn\u2019t respect that. Ana loved to hit me, push me and pinch me, not to hurt but to annoy. They made a mess in the house and it was hard to make them help. Among many other things. \n\nMy mom kept it all in house. We lived as siblings, she treated us as siblings. We had family talks and were punished. She never ran to their mom to complain. They weren\u2019t being malicious, only annoying teenagers. Their mom didn\u2019t really care about their behavior and they never had limits but my mom understood it wasn\u2019t their fault and did her best to not lose her cool and be another person to kick them out. \n\nNow (10 years later), my aunt remarried and her husband has a daughter Sam (15) that lives with them. I\u2019ve met her a bunch of times and she\u2019s a sweet girl. During Easter dinner, aunt kept badmouthing Sam. Saying that she doesn\u2019t cook for herself and if left alone, she only eats junk food, she stays most of the time in her room. She leaves dirty dishes in the sink. She eats all their food. Aunt said that sometimes when Sam leaves things messy, aunt stops talking to her husband to put \u201cpressure\u201d on him. She said that if Sam\u2019s mom still lived in our country, she would already have send Sam back. Husband backed that up. I just said \u201cyou think she is impossible because you never raised or lived with your kids when they were teenagers\u201d.\n\nI told her that she was just describing an average teenager and that if she wanted to know how an impossible one was, I could tell her all about the stuff her kids did when they lived with us. She was pretty embarrassed because everyone knows that at the time she didn\u2019t care and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t know about it all. I told her that she should be the mature one and couldn\u2019t expect adult behavior from a 15 year old. And that maybe if she raised her kids, she would know how to navigate this better.", "created_utc": 1681177410, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12i44ui/aita_for_letting_my_aunt_know_how_annoying_her/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Karma should be paying you for your services. That's all I have to say about that. \ud83e\udd23", "God*daaaaaaamn.*  \n\n\nYou might have been an AH, but I won't vote because that was **epic**.", "OOOh, spilling the family tea to the new hubs! NTA, maybe opening the new guys eyes will give your new cousin some breathing room, sounds like she needs it; your aunt seems awful,  still, after all these years.", "NTA.  \n\n\nJudge not, lest ye be judged. Your aunt should have kept her mouth shut.", "NTA good for you for setting the records straight. Your aunt is terrible, but let\u2019s talk about your mom for a min. That woman is a saint!!", "You called out your aunt\u2019s hypocrisy about the stepdaughter\u2019s behaviour. Your mother did a good job at caring for Ana and Elsa.\n\nSam is also adjusting with a lot of changes in life given the new family dynamic. She\u2019s still a teenager. You\u2019re NTA for defending her. She deserves better understanding from her new family.", "I say NTA. It was really rude of her to be complaining about the minor things her stepchild does to everyone. And why the hell would she ignore her husband because of it? She\u2019s an AH", "NTA. I\u2019m glad Sam has someone to stick up for her, and your comment was only the truth!", "Yeah I\u2019m definitely going with NTA. Truly hilarious.", "NTA - what\u2019s a family dinner without some spilled tea?!", "NTA, and I'm very proud of you for giving your aunt a reality check. So many absent parents (either physically or emotionally) don't seem to realise how terrible they are and if they aren't told they will go on with their lives thinking their farts smell like roses. \n\nYou should've marched her right out of the house as well.", "All I can say is: \"Day-um, girl!\" Hope you keep cream handy for when you hand out burns like that. Good for you for telling your aunt how the cow ate the cabbage.\n\nNTA", "NTA x a million. Your aunt doesn\u2019t get to complain about raising a teenager when she carted her own children around from relative to relative instead of actually raising them herself. \n\nDid the sisters end up being well-adjusted adults? I hope for their sake that their upbringing didn\u2019t lead to issues as adults.", "op=NTA\n\nGood for you for standing up for Sam.  I wonder if Sam spends so much time in her room because she's avoiding StepMom and Dad who have told her they'd throw her away if they could.  What horrible \"parents\".\n\nShe eats all their food?  do they only buy junk food? and if she doesn't cook for herself, is it because she doesn't know how?", "NTA. And well done, indeed.", "I mean, probably? But you also said what needed to be said, and I really enjoyed reading it so if you're an AH you're the best kind!\n\nYour aunt is badmouthing her stepdaughter for what she thinks is abnormally bratty behavior **because, as you rightly pointed out, she didn't raise her own daughters.** That needs to be said, and frankly if her husband is just nodding along to this I'm inclined to think it needed to be said in front of him as well.\n\nIt also sounds like you dealt with a challenging home situation (two very upset older cousins being moved in to become instant sisters) incredibly well in the moment, and have continued to have a balanced and empathetic view point about it. You easily could have hit your aunt harder, or been nasty about your cousins but you weren't. You simply pointed out that the aspects of housing her stepdaughter she finds so unpalatable are odd to her because she isn't used to housing teenagers as her own didn't live with her. I think that's a very fair point", "NTA.  Truth bomb!  \nAlso props to your mother for taking those girls in and parenting them even though they were difficult. It takes a strong person to do that.", "NTA. \nTruths were told. Hopefully Sam will be better off for them being told.", "NTA. You put her in her place.\n\nCurious to know what her 2 daughters are up to now?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
