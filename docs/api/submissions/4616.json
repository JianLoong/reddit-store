She just finished training and making around the same amount of money I am but that's gonna increase as she gets more experience. I've always wanted to become a teacher because the shitty uninspiring teachers I grew up with made me sad because I think they are partly to blame for kids to be unmotivated. Now I quit my job I've been working for nearly 5 years to enroll full time in school when my girlfriend said I can't.\n\nI spent almost 5 years now working tirelessly at multiple jobs that I hate to put her through school so she can become what she wanted to be.

It's been a tough few years but it was worth it to see how happy she was when we graduated.\n\nLast week I told my wife that since she's finished school and making money it's time for me to quit my job to go to school to do what I want to do. She looked at me like I was mad. She told me that I can't quit my job because we will fall into financial troubles and she can't keep everything going by herself. I got mad at her telling how long I spent doing jobs I hated for her to finish school and if I can do it she can to and that was the end of it. She stormed off not say anything more the rest of the night, god knows I slept on the couch.\n\nBefore I even got up to head to work to hand in my 2 week notice I got a call from her mother telling me that I was selfish for wanting to quit my job and to put all the work and financial responsibilities on my girlfriend and that I should keep my job if I want to go to school, she sounded very angry and this was a woman I'd known since my early childhood, our parents are friends. I tried to explain myself and she wasn't understanding so I hung up. I turned in my notice a few hours ago and am home trying to get myself enrolled, my girlfriend will be home in a few hours and I hope she is more open minded and understanding than she was last night, I'm a little scared to be honest.", "created_utc": 1670927801, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zksltw/aita_for_quitting_my_job_when_my_girlfriend_and/", "score": 540, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's great that you were willing to support her while she finished her education, but that doesn't automatically give you the right to assume she will do the same for you. Her life and her money is for HER to decide. You should have talked this out and made an agreement, a plan TOGETHER.  Yes, it would be the FAIR thing for her to be the primary breadwinner while you finish your education, but you don't get to just assume it, you need to reach that agreement first.

I would suspect during the 5 years of bills/rent-free life, they discussed things somewhat but the partner wants the status quo:  in which all of the partners wishes are met, while OP labors and sacrifices to support them both.  \n\nI think there's a LOT of good-intentions being assumed by commenters, and excuses being made as to why \"just better timing\" or \"better conversations\" could have made this all go away.", "Yeah, that confuses me. Unless he's going to a community college (at least to start) he's well passed the application deadline for spring 2023. The soonest he could get accepted would be summer, if they take take applications for summer.", "Yeah this is a bad move. I\u2019ve seen it a ton of times how one gets what they want then leave when it\u2019s the others turn.", "Tf he did it and she cant ? A nurse cant hold it down for her husband so that they can be even better off in the long run lol sick", "If she leaves after getting a job when he supported her financially through school then I\u2019d think he has a textbook case for alimony, no?", "Exactly. What if OP doesn\u2019t make it into the school he wants? What if his gf breaks up with him over this and now he has no job? There\u2019s no mention of a fully thought out game plan, just someone who couldn\u2019t wait to quit working. ESH for sure.", "This, ESH. You're 100% in the right but should have handled it with a bit of a buffer. Something about this caught her off guard and right or wrong she deserved a bit of time to process it.\n\nAlso, as some others have asked, why quit before you're enrolled? Something sounds a little off there.", "He's not even enrolled in school yet! There is plenty of time to talk about their situation and let his wife adjust to her new working life before quitting his job. He likely won't be able to get into a program until next fall. He quit on her first day of work ffs\n\nI get where op is coming from and it's more than fair for it to be his turn to go to school but unilaterally making life altering decisions is not the way to go about it. Should not have quit until \n1 he and wife are on the same page, this means with a financial plan so they both know she can handle the bills solo, she adjusts to her work schedule, you know iron out the details. Don't just quit and hope for the best that she can pick up the slack immediately \n2 he's actually in a program and has a start date.", "Wrong! She originally said she was fine with OP going back to school once she was working! She went back on her word.", "Sooo if you quit, and she just started, who is covering the medical insurance? Most employers don't even offer it for the first six months.\n\nIf you pay all the bills, where was the hand off to make sure her check is being deposited properly? To review the financial state of your household?  Are there auto-pay bills she needs to know about?\n\nYou didn't even wait two months for her to settle in and to see what your financial situation actually would be. \n\nI would be fucking pissed. You're so eager to pass it on and to make her experience what you experienced that you're apparently fine taking risks that she's not comfortable with.\n\nYour girlfriend had a plan, you don't. You have worked hard for five years (only five), and you're obviously resentful to the point that you will cut off your nose to spite your face. \n\nAlso kind of a PS: there's no such thing as \"my turn\" or \"I deserve\" when you're in the same fucking boat. You *have to* coordinate your efforts or you will go nowhere fast.", "What's your plan if she leaves you?", "Do you have savings incase her job can\u2019t cover all of your expenses", "Dude what are you going to do if she leaves you? You've left yourself no contingency plan here. You're operating entirely emotionally without thinking at all.", "Okay, I get being done with a job. Is there no vacation days? Or FMLA, FMLA can be used for mental health reasons.\n\nDo you save for this to happen? What happens if she leaves you? Will you have money?\n\nDoes this have implications for financial aid at school? How is school being paid for?\n\nDid your wife mean you cannot quit today? Or you cannot quit ever? Perhaps she was worried about how things are going to get paid for? Was this budgeted for previously?\n\nThe lack of planning here is stressing me out.", "Holy shit dude. What if her job doesn't work out? YTA. Not for wanting to quit your job and go to school but because you have not made a plan AT ALL.", "What happens if her job doesn\u2019t work out and she loses it in a week?", "Except it kind of is when you haven\u2019t even enrolled or been accepted anywhere. What\u2019s the two of your savings account look like? How do you think she feels already being stressed having to work for the first time in her life and now having the added pressure that the entire household depends on her because you couldn\u2019t even give her a transition period to get used to working. Save some money, get your ducks in a row and actually enroll in school. Also no one \u201cdeserves\u201d anything at the expense of other people", ">This is her first day of work in her entire life and she's 25\n\nWow. This just went from communication issues to just plain stupid. You are pinning your household's financial wellbeing on someone who has never worked a day in their life? Like, no shade on your girlfriend, I'm sure she will be successful in her career, but this is a whole new experience for her. There may be bumps along the way as she gets her footing. It's a little like getting your first job at 16 and your parents saying, \"OK, we quit our jobs. It's all on you now.\" Incredibly bad decision making on your part.", "I mean he straight up said he \u201cassumed\u201d that she knew he\u2019d be quitting his job. \u201cI thought me quitting my job was implied because this was when she was at school still\u201d. Assuming she knew, then only clarifying the day before he quit is an asshole move.", "I mean the gf is doing what lots of people do, say surface words about caring that their partner gets to get an education/pursue their dream after they support them through getting theirs only to turn around & say no. The gf had no intention of ever supporting Op like he supported her or else she\u2019d have been talking about it & planning it with the Op instead of letting him assume she would. It sucks but the gf has no interest in changing the status quo even if it would lead to them both being happier people in the future with careers they are invested in", "Nope", "They\u2019re not married, so no. No marriage = no protections and certainly no alimony.", "Nope.", "Nope. Men shouldn't get alimony.", "Lol nah", "Living cost today is not the same as 5y ago, they just keep raising.\n\nAlso - he is not even starting the school in 2w nor he is accepted anywhere, why quit now?", "Whether or not his girlfriend will fuck him over doesn't have any bearing on whether he has the right to quit his job.", "He has to do what he has to do. At this point, he probably knows what could be coming. He is tired.", "She never said she was fine with him quitting his job before hes even enrolled and before she even gets her first paycheck", "Damn where you working that most employers don\u2019t offer it for 6 months? I\u2019ve worked plenty of jobs that didn\u2019t offer health insurance (or affordable health insurance), but the ones that did it was always after one month of employment, except for my current unicorn that started on the day I started.", "Right? This is seriously poor planning.\n\nOP, A vague agreement that when she's done with school, you'll go does not mean that the instant she's done you get to quit work. Like, WTF? \n\nAdults would sit down and make a real, concrete plan. Like, \"OK, you've started your new job, that's awesome! Let's look at what it's going to take so I can start school ASAP...\" and you look at schools, file FAFSA forms, work on applications, etc. You both work for a while overlapping so you can put away a little extra money, and put in notice when you have a definite schedule, know when you're starting classes, etc. If you want to take a month off before school to take a break, that's fine, but you don't just spring \"OK you're now the breadwinner in your brand new job you just started today!\" on somebody!\n\nIt was crappy for them not to have made a more solid plan in the first place, but springing something like this on her with essentially no notice when he's not even applied to any schools and has no idea when classes might start IF he gets in? That's terrible, and I understand why she's balking. If she's going back on the idea and not wanting him to go to school at all, that's shitty, but if she's just freaking out a little that on her very first day of work he's putting in notice so all finances will be on her for the forseeable future, when he has no actual plan about going to school? That's understandable, she's probably terrified.", "Yes this is a huge problem and I feel this relationship probably won't last", "Agree with this.  She had an agenda and a time table in mind and needed his support yo pull it off.  She probably still has a timetable and doesn\u2019t want his returning to school to interrupt her life plan.", "But he called her his wife in the post. Are they or aren't they married?\n\n>Last week I told my wife that since she's finished school and making money it's time for me to quit my job to go to school to do what I want to do.", "Huh??? Says who??", "Totally.", "Yeah, I suspect she isn't actually reneging on the deal personally, but OP is painting it like that as he won't compromise. But he had the suspicion she might, so rolled with it as part of the poor planning. \n\nI get being *absolutely goddmaned done* with a job, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do if it isn't killing you. \n\nReread the original post - she's a nurse, so possibly more stable depending on country (my country the health system is in a mess, so may not be as stable and horrible work environment isn't uncommon) and he wants to be a teacher for somewhat suspect reasons. If he's in the US, I feel like he'll be in for a very rude awakening. The things I've heard about teaching there... makes teaching look good in my country.", "He confirmed it\u2019s his girlfriend and they are not married. He just thinks of her as his wife which, if she leaves him, he will find out there is certainly a big difference."]}
