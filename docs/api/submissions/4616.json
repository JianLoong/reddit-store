She just finished training and making around the same amount of money I am but that's gonna increase as she gets more experience. I've always wanted to become a teacher because the shitty uninspiring teachers I grew up with made me sad because I think they are partly to blame for kids to be unmotivated. Now I quit my job I've been working for nearly 5 years to enroll full time in school when my girlfriend said I can't.\n\nI spent almost 5 years now working tirelessly at multiple jobs that I hate to put her through school so she can become what she wanted to be. She hasn't paid a single months rent since we moved in together and she hasn't paid any bills either because I've worked hard to sure she never had to get a part time that'd distract her from her courses. It's been a tough few years but it was worth it to see how happy she was when we graduated.\n\nLast week I told my wife that since she's finished school and making money it's time for me to quit my job to go to school to do what I want to do. She looked at me like I was mad. She told me that I can't quit my job because we will fall into financial troubles and she can't keep everything going by herself. I got mad at her telling how long I spent doing jobs I hated for her to finish school and if I can do it she can to and that was the end of it. She stormed off not say anything more the rest of the night, god knows I slept on the couch.\n\nBefore I even got up to head to work to hand in my 2 week notice I got a call from her mother telling me that I was selfish for wanting to quit my job and to put all the work and financial responsibilities on my girlfriend and that I should keep my job if I want to go to school, she sounded very angry and this was a woman I'd known since my early childhood, our parents are friends. I tried to explain myself and she wasn't understanding so I hung up. I turned in my notice a few hours ago and am home trying to get myself enrolled, my girlfriend will be home in a few hours and I hope she is more open minded and understanding than she was last night, I'm a little scared to be honest.", "created_utc": 1670927801, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zksltw/aita_for_quitting_my_job_when_my_girlfriend_and/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You force her to provide for you against her will or to break up with you?

It's great that you were willing to support her while she finished her education, but that doesn't automatically give you the right to assume she will do the same for you. Her life and her money is for HER to decide. You should have talked this out and made an agreement, a plan TOGETHER.  Yes, it would be the FAIR thing for her to be the primary breadwinner while you finish your education, but you don't get to just assume it, you need to reach that agreement first.

You worked hard to put her through school, but now she doesn\u2019t want to do the same for you.  NEWSFLASH: she was using you to pay the bills.
