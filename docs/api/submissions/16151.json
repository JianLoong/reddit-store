As stated, each side of your family (yours & his) received $60k. **NTA,** and your MIL sounds ungrateful. Also, your SIL should have never mentioned she'd said that.

That your parents are split doesn't matter. Every household got the same amount and frankly I'd tell MIL that if she feels so strongly about it she can run that 20k back to you immediately. Bet she'll shut up real quick", "Wow! NTA. Your MIL should be ashamed of herself for being so entitled and ungrateful. Unless you have a pre-existing agreement with your family to share the money if any one of you wins the lottery (for example), there's a reason most financial professionals advise people to be discreet about financial windfalls. Money can amplify a person's characteristics, and obviously one of your MIL's struggles is greed. If you haven't already given her the money, I would tell her to forget it and not give her a cent. If you already have given it to her, your husband needs to have a strong conversation with her about her behavior.", "NTA. the cheek of it all! tell her you want it back.", "NTA - Seriously, who the fuck complains about getting free money when they were entitled to none of it? You sound great, MIL sounds awful. I'd take it back from her if I could.", "NTA. What a choosy beggar. I can't imagine sticking my hand out to my adult child's *spouse* and demanding twenty thousand dollars. Tell her, \"sorry, your portion got spent on DHs therapy. Had a lot to unpack.\"", "NTA!

His parents can get divorced then they can get their 20k each.\n\nBut in all seriousness, the 20k is for each household. They money isn't just going to your dad, but also your step mum and contributes to their home. Your mum gets 20k for her family and home. Likewise, his parents have 20k to their home. \n\nIn all honesty, none of that matters really. It's your money and unless it's distributing to your own children, you can give as much or as little as you like.

Most people who received a lot of money like you did would keep it for themselves but you and your husband decided to share it with family which is admirable. Your MIL should be thanking you for your generosity and reflect on the fact that you didn't have to give her anything at all.", "NTA. You can give away YOUR money however you choose. No one has any right to tell you what to do with your money. Anything anyone gets is an amount they should be grateful for. MIL is being rude, ungrateful, selfish and many other things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she has a problem I would respond with \"Since you feel our gift was inadequate, we will be sure to make sure you aren't included next time to prevent you from feeling slighted by a low amount.\"", "NTA.\n\n\nIf she's so unhappy with what she received, she's welcome to give it back.", "NTA, giving everyone that much money is generous in any case, and complaining about it is absurd.

And besides it's not like your mom/dad/step are living in the same household. Your mom isn't going to spend her half on you'd and wife or vice versa. You gave each the same amount. They shouldn't have asked for anything more. I'm with your husband, it's embarrassing and showing them as ungrateful. You didn't have to give anyone anything. This was your money and your choice.
