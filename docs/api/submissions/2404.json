As a physician myself, I appreciated how patients let me be part of the care team when I was in medical school so of course I said yes. No big deal, right? So then this female med student walks in and starts to get my history. I stop her and request that she leaves. Confused, she asked why. I stated that I would be fine with having male students, but I feel uncomfortable with a female student as this is urology. She seemed upset, but left the room. Later, I mention this to my wife and she told me I was being as asshole for kicking her out for being female. How I was contributing to sexism and denying her an education for being a woman. However, I like my modesty and I don't want a woman I don't know looking at my genitals, it's just uncomfortable. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I know she's a physician in training. When I said \"random female\" I meant someone that wasn't my wife. Also, some people have called me out for using the term \"female\" saying it's misogynistic. I apologize for that term, i'm so ingrained in using terms like male, female, etc from work but i'll try to be better. I edited the OP from \"female\" to \"woman\".\n\nEDIT 2: many people are calling me an asshole for assuming med students are male. Urology isn't a core rotation, it's an elective that people typically do if they're interested in urology. Around 90% of urologists are males. So I assumed that the students interested in applying to urology would also overwhelmingly be male. As a physician, i'm trained in pattern recognition and to assume something is a horse and not a zebra.\n\nEDIT 3: since I keep getting grilled about this: I have nothing against women wanting to do urology. If anything, I think it's great because women have GU issues too and many prefer women urologists. But as a male, I prefer a male urologist.", "created_utc": 1668538599, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw68mj/aita_for_kicking_out_the_medical_student_for/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With that being said, no one batted an eye when I complained about being kicked of so why are people making a big deal now.", "But only with their consent, so that's not really relevant.", "The assumption is a nonissue to me because it\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t think about men or women. When choosing a doctor many don\u2019t mention gender preferences but will choose based on sex. \n\nTo me it\u2019s like coming on Reddit and thinking someone commenting is a white male from the US when many times that\u2019s not the case. We can go into further details but that\u2019s the general idea.", "patient preference and comfort can only be accommodated when it is communicated. you did not communicate your preference and then shamed others for not being able to mind read.\n\ngosh, please tell us your real name so we can all avoid your practice. your simplistic thinking, and overt bias must make you a terrible doctor...", "I didn't say it was different then than now. It doesn't change that you did to them what you disliked people doing to you.", "Why are you so obsessed with her being a woman that chose urology? Do you think that women shouldn't be allowed to choose urology?", "nope, women and queer people think about the gender of their doctor all the time. it is a straight male privilege to not have to worry about comfort level at the doctor.\n\ni always prefer a female doctor, and i am a queer man.", "But he did communicate it, when he asked her to leave..? And where was the shaming?", "I'm not. I just thought it was unexpected given the history of the field.", "He didn\u2019t communicate it until after the fact, and someone in his profession should be aware that women can and do in fact become doctors in various fields of medicine.", "You've mentioned that urology is an elective countless times in comments. It clearly gets your goat that she chose this elective.", "He communicated it as soon as he recognised it - when she walked in. Just because he said yes initially doesn't mean he can't change his mind.\n\nHe's also clearly aware that women can be doctors.  He just didn't expect it in this exact situation. Where was the shaming?", "The context was them comparing it to OBGYN. I was forced to take OBGYN, I didn't choose it."]}
