The store has a policy that we cannot buy anything from the New Arrivals section. Clothes typically stay there for 2 weeks before we can relocate them and buy things for ourselves. Our boss however allows us one override per year where we can buy a new item we really like anyways. The yearly override resets on October 1st.\n\n\nSo Anne regularly gets around this policy because she takes note of the new arrivals and sends her friend to buy the things she wants for her. However, she doesn't do this because she actually wants the clothes, she just resells them online. I took some pictures of the clothes she was reselling online but initially decided to do nothing with them because I didn't want to be a snitch. Last week James found a nice pair of shoes he wanted so that he'd have affordable ones to wear to his brother's wedding. He already used his override this year but I had not. I told him he could use my override since he always drives me to work and then bought the shoes. Anne checked us out and gave us a really annoyed face that I ignored at the time.\n\n\nWhen James and I came into work yesterday our boss said he wanted to talk with us. He said Anne had accused us of abusing the override system because we wanted to resell the shoes (apparently they were worth a lot.) We denied this and explained why I used my override to buy something for James instead of myself. Our boss understood and said we were fine. When I went back to the register to start my shift Anne got all snotty and said \"Maybe you fooled him but I know what you guys are up to.\" I was officially pissed at this point and walked back into my bosses office. I showed him the pictures of our clothes being resold by Anne and pointed out the friend buying things for her. He thanked me and the day went on normally so I figured she'd get a slap on the wrist. It turned out that he actually fired Anne and banned her friend from shopping at the store any more.\n\n\nJames and I have been getting lots of texts from Anne and her friends. I feel bad because James didn't do anything and now he's getting roped into the situation I caused. I also found a buch of broken glass on my doorstep that Anne put there. My roomate says I should have let it go and I'm starting to think she was right. It just infuriated me in the moment that she was trying to get me in trouble for something that she was actually doing but now my roomate and James are dealing with the fallout too.
