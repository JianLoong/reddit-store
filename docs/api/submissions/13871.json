A huge problem is that my mom has been referring her clients to me (she tells them where I work, my name, and even shows them pictures of me!) and saying that I can give them a high interest rate on accounts or low interest rates on loans and other stuff. She makes up a random number for the rates and guarantees I can give it to her clients. This is a lie an I cannot alter rates in any way whatsoever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe clients would end up getting super upset at me, saying things like, \"your mom said you could!\" as if her words hold truer than mine - the person who actually works at the bank! And keeps trying to get me to give them the rate my mom told them. They have even complained to my manager. Thankfully, my manager commends me for handling everything professionally. My manager does not know my mom is doing this and thinks I'm just getting an unusually high number of entitled people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom does not seem to have any repercussions by doing this, her clients might sometimes whine that they couldn't get the rate and she would be sympathetic and the clients just stay with her. She is good at her actual job and I think the clients think she was trying to be nice to them by referring them to me and it's not her fault I couldn't give them rates so her clients stay with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has gone on for TWO years. I have talked to this about her very sternly and tried different ways to get her to stop every time I get one of her referrals and she does not stop. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm getting ready for a promotion and I need this to stop now. So now, whenever her clients come to me and say my mom referred them to me and said I could get them so and so rate, I would give them a very serious look and say, \"There must be some mistake. My mother died 6 years ago.\" Some have told me that she showed pictures of me to them and I would ask them to show me my mom's information and they would show me her instagram and website. I would write down her IG handle and URL on my notepad and then tell the clients that I have never seen this woman in my life and I do not know how she got my pictures. I would ask what kind of pictures does this woman have of me and some other questions and then say I will see what I can do about this but to get back to the client's request, I can only give them the rates available. Most of them get really uncomfortable and make an excuse to leave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince them, I've no longer received any complaints. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater, I met up with my mom and she told me she has been losing a lot of clients and doesn't know why. I said maybe it's because I've been more stern towards the clients she refers to me. I didn't tell her the whole story though. She's quite mad at me but has agreed to finally stop referring them to me. I am a bit worried that people now think my mom is some sort of crazy stalker though.
