She'd been the previous treasurer, and when it came time to hand over the books and cash jar (there was no formality to the club, not registered as a legal entity, so we couldn't get a bank account), she wanted to meet up for coffee.\n\nWe sit down, she pulls out an old style ledger sheet and proceeds to say, \"this is a \"led-ger sheet\" and is used for keeping a record of money coming in and out.\"\n\nI chuckled a little - not outright laughing, but pointed out that I've got years of bookkeeping experience, so I'm good, I understand it all.\n\nShe made a little mmm hmm noise and continued, \"as I said (pointing to the debit and credit columns), this is where you record money coming in and out.\"\n\nI said, \"seriously, I don't need the lesson.

Otherwise it looks like you're just kind of patronizing.\"\n\nMy husband had already directly told her to buzz off on a couple of occasions because she was really THAT intrusive on conversations, so between the two of us, we kind of opened the valve on others telling her if they needed her help,  they'd be sure to reach out during office hours.\n\nShe moved shortly after that.

And that would have ended the entire thing, possible even a professional phone call made by myself to your mother warning her of legal action for damaging the business reputation (obv, she would never be sued but a letter is serious enough)\n\n\nFurthermore OP, you are incredibly shortsighted, being known as the person with the craziest and most entitled clients is a bad thing, when only one person is having the majority those problems it means that one person is the problem. It affects your office reputation and I assure you that your colleagues whisper behind your back. Furthermore, you decided to resolve the issue in an incredibly imbecilic way - with another lie that is easy to prove.\n\nTo add to that point, having so many entitled clients who also complain results in a bad reputation for the business and the branch.\n\n**Reputation is everything, and you outright lying to your management is a huge issue, even grounds for non promotion or dismissal due to your concious dishonesty, very poor judgement and how imbecilic your problem solving skills are.**\n\nAs your manager I'd have concerns whether you are fit for a leadership role.
