A huge problem is that my mom has been referring her clients to me (she tells them where I work, my name, and even shows them pictures of me!) and saying that I can give them a high interest rate on accounts or low interest rates on loans and other stuff. She makes up a random number for the rates and guarantees I can give it to her clients. This is a lie an I cannot alter rates in any way whatsoever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe clients would end up getting super upset at me, saying things like, \"your mom said you could!\" as if her words hold truer than mine - the person who actually works at the bank! And keeps trying to get me to give them the rate my mom told them. They have even complained to my manager. Thankfully, my manager commends me for handling everything professionally. My manager does not know my mom is doing this and thinks I'm just getting an unusually high number of entitled people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mom does not seem to have any repercussions by doing this, her clients might sometimes whine that they couldn't get the rate and she would be sympathetic and the clients just stay with her. She is good at her actual job and I think the clients think she was trying to be nice to them by referring them to me and it's not her fault I couldn't give them rates so her clients stay with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has gone on for TWO years. I have talked to this about her very sternly and tried different ways to get her to stop every time I get one of her referrals and she does not stop. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm getting ready for a promotion and I need this to stop now. So now, whenever her clients come to me and say my mom referred them to me and said I could get them so and so rate, I would give them a very serious look and say, \"There must be some mistake. My mother died 6 years ago.\" Some have told me that she showed pictures of me to them and I would ask them to show me my mom's information and they would show me her instagram and website. I would write down her IG handle and URL on my notepad and then tell the clients that I have never seen this woman in my life and I do not know how she got my pictures. I would ask what kind of pictures does this woman have of me and some other questions and then say I will see what I can do about this but to get back to the client's request, I can only give them the rates available. Most of them get really uncomfortable and make an excuse to leave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince them, I've no longer received any complaints. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater, I met up with my mom and she told me she has been losing a lot of clients and doesn't know why. I said maybe it's because I've been more stern towards the clients she refers to me. I didn't tell her the whole story though. She's quite mad at me but has agreed to finally stop referring them to me. I am a bit worried that people now think my mom is some sort of crazy stalker though.

His look of horror and shame made me feel so guilty. I was probably the asshole for that one.", "I haven't told my manager and coworkers because this will reflect badly on me. Right now everyone just thinks I'm randomly getting entitled customers and it's a funny joke in the office like, \"haha, OP, you got any crazy customer stories today?\" If they find out my mom is referring these people to me, it can destroy my career. I'm scared of people thinking i'm in cahoots with my mom and we are purposely spreading false information so that I would get clients coming to me. I really can't let anyone at work know. Because I am getting a promotion, I'm worried my mom will use my new position to make more lies about what benefits I can give clients and also that this will eventually come out so that's why I'm taking drastic measures to stop this ASAP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have told my mom multiple times in the past that her lies can get me fired but she brushes it off. She won't be sorry until i actually get fired.", "> I was probably the asshole for that one.\n\nYour mom was TA for that one (and all the others). She set up that guy to put himself in an uncomfortable situation *for no reason*.", "Got it. Maybe you can show her the specific regulations that make it illegal for you to do what she's promising her clients. They're probably available to search online. Ask her, \"Do you really want me to get fired? I will, if you keep doing this.\"", "Honestly sooner or later they will find out.

If she was my mother I wouldnt have anything to do with her, because she is messing with your job. That is someone who is not your friend.

There's no option for me to change the percentage. I think only a hacker who can hack into the bank system can do it. She doesn't care if the rates are fulfilled because her goal is to brag that she has a successful child and therefore can help make her clients successful as well as to show her clients she has a lot of connections - her goal is not to actually get the clients those rates. And she won't care until I actually get fired, only then will she feel bad. I considered faking getting fired but I'm quite prominent at work and am on the website and stuff so she can easily check if I was really fired by checking the website or going to my bank. So pretending i didn't know her was my other plan."]}
