Your parents deserve blame for allowing that to happen.  And you own blame for treating them poorly.  It's not the kids fault and you recognized that.

Still, kids that age are likely to feel rejected based on your behavior, and even if your mom\u2019s on the terrace, you ought to have told her you were stepping out (no indication you did, so it\u2019s an assumption you didn\u2019t).

It sucks for the girls but it\u2019s their parents fault. No one is owed a free babysitter or even friendship. OP tried to include the girls but their behavior was off putting to the actual party guests so they were entertained by the parents so the birthday girl could enjoy her party. Other than completely changing the vibe of the party and sacrificing the comfort of her guests there was no way for a 14 year old to entertain a 6 snd 9 year old.

There would never be a time in their childhoods where they will be in similar development stages. It would always be a babysitter relationship and if they have overstepped with babysitting this early into knowing my teen I wouldn\u2019t encourage a friendship. \n\nShe\u2019s not going to come home from high school and run over to play with elementary students. Nor would anyone consider that normal\u2026 why judge her on a friendship unlikely to have developed?

And it wasn't just my own comfort, my friends, the actual invited guests, were feeling uncomfortable too.", "I think it's understandable the ones who didn't have their birthday, looked after the kids. For eg, if this had happened on my mom's bday instead, me and dad would have babysat.\nIf I stayed to help look after the kids I would either have to:\n1) incorporate them into the party making my friends extremely uncomfortable \nOR\n2) look after them seperately thus abandoning my friends, the actual invited guests\nOf course it wasn't fair on my parents to look after them but it was the only option.\nGoing for a walk with my friend was not the wisest decision but I really needed to get out of that situation at that moment, for my friend's sake too.
