For the past several days she has been unloading all of her emotional and mental issues on him via text and phone calls. General stress stuff regarding her fianc\u00e9 and work and life. He has expressed to me several times that he\u2019s getting frustrated with her because this is all she talks to him about and when he tells her he is too busy but will text her later, she takes it as he doesn\u2019t care and is abandoning her. \u201cEpisodes\u201d like this happen very frequently and this is just the latest one. \n\nFor instance, at work he couldn\u2019t respond to her right away and she got annoyed with him. My BF and I were out at dinner earlier this week and he was constantly on his phone but she wouldn\u2019t let him go without trying to make him feel guilty. He has been complaining to me about her neediness and clinginess and now I am getting annoyed with it haha. \n\nWe all went out to breakfast this morning and she just kept talking about how stressed she was and how she thinks her fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t feel the same way anymore. It\u2019s obvious to me that she\u2019s stressed out and possibly having anxiety attacks and that\u2019s why she\u2019s clinging to my BF for help (and likely her own BF\u2026 It sounds like her behavior is too much for him and he\u2019s pushing her away because of it). I get that, I really do but he is not a therapist and him not being able to help her as much as she wants make her feel abandoned so overall it is just a lose-lose for both of them. \n\nAbout 45 minutes into breakfast they had gotten into a bit of a tense discussion and she was starting to lose her cool. I had not said a single word the whole breakfast other than hi how is it going? It was all about her and tbh I was getting annoyed but I honestly hate confrontation so I thought it was best to keep out of it. \n\nAt one point the conversation took a turn and was now about my boyfriend being a bad friend and I stepped in I said something along the lines of \u201cNo actually I don\u2019t think he is a bad friend. A bad friend would not spend days at a time constantly being available to you when you go through hard times. I think you have really high expectations and want him available to you 24/7 which is unreasonable. You take him setting boundaries as abandonment which is only hurting your friendship. He fucking loves you but you only care about him when you need something and that sucks for him.\u201d\n\nWell, she just about lost her shit at me and said a lot of not so nice things in return. I realize my timing was impeccable, however I couldn\u2019t sit there and listen to her anymore. She ended up taking an Uber an hour home and sending me a venmo request for the cost of it because she was too upset to drive. \n\nI feel like I was nice enough. Direct. And said what my boyfriend had been saying to me for days. He thanked me for it but is obviously upset by her reaction. I think once she calms down she\u2019ll be fine but my boyfriend feels bad about it which is making me feel like maybe I was an AH?", "created_utc": 1685107233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sd3nz/aita_for_standing_up_for_my_boyfriend_and_calling/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like she is relying exclusively on him for her emotional well-being and that is neither fair to him nor is it his responsibility. That she sent you a Venmo request because she was \"too upset to drive\" is telling. She *chose* to take the Uber, but somehow you're responsible. She won't take responsibility for that choice, much like she won't take responsibility for her own well-being.", "NTA\nShe's so called emotional vampire. She's just taking your energy and gives nothing in return. She acts very selfish. Even if she's having hard time, I can't imagine her not asking you how are you and talk at least a little bit about something else than her. She doesn't give a F about you or the friendship. \n\nAnd her being mad about the phone... That's wild! She's acting like spoiled entitled child. \n\nI would be curious what did she say to you in return. Was it like personal attack?", "NTA. She is depending on your BF to be her on call therapist. But he needs to learn how to set his own boundaries with his friendships, it shouldn\u2019t be your problem.", "NTA\n\nThat friend needed a reality check, and you gave her one in a respectfult way. It might have hurt her, but she needed it. As you pointed out yourself: she needs therapy and your bf isn't a therapist.", "NTA\n\nDo not under any circumstance pay her for the Uber.\n\nYour bf is a Saint and she is a user. She won't respect boundaries as she's shown time and time again so he needs to cut her off. She is being an appalling friend, not your bf.", "Nta she can\u2019t rely on him 24/7 even if they are best friends", "NTA. You may have been a little harsh at the end of your statement but for the most part the things you stated were true and fair especially given the toll this is taking on your boyfriend. It\u2019s also reasonable to want to step in and defend your partner when you\u2019re the one witnessing how good of a friend he is being. Could have been slightly more gentle in your approach but overall, NTA. Her mental state is important, but she needs a therapist, not your boyfriends 24/7 attention.", "NTA.  Assertive behavior in defense of BF is expected.  You did good.", "He should stop taking her calls when they come in and wait to reply to her texts a couple hours. I'd let her get used to a new kind of friendship dynamic where she isn't in control, if I were your BF. \"Sorry was busy. So, are things better now?\" Or something to that effect until she appreciates that he told her to stand down.\n\nSilence is great communication sometimes. And a succubus devouring my life via texts and calls when I'm busy is getting crickets from me. Not explanations. Not patience. Not renegotiated relationship dynamics. Crickets.\n\nNTA. No way. It almost sounds like she wants your BF for *her* BF.\n\nA Venmo request for her hour long Uber ride because she was too delicate to drive herself home? She is an emotional vampire it seems? No point in letting her suck the life out of you. (And I'd have sent her a hyenas cackling message right back.)", "NTA \n\nI can't blame the girl though..it doesn't sound like it is her usual behaviour. Seems like she is having a bit of a major crisis. Hope she gets over it. It's great you stood up for your boyfriend.

This is his friend and his gripe - he should have been the one to talk to her about it. Instead she\u2019s going through a difficult time and instead of her friend gently pointing out that maybe she was being a little too focused on that and pushing friends away, she got chastised by his gf over breakfast.", "NTA. This lady is jealous of your relationship with your boyfriend, and is just using him as an emotional support item to deal with her insecurities and anxiety. You told her off and gave her the cold and hard truth. You don't owe her anything, including the money she is demanding on Venmo. You also need to have a private conversation with your boyfriend and tell him to limit your conversations and interactions with her over the phone, and in person. I am amazed that you have tolerated her all this time, and you didn't say anything beforehand.", "Mild YTA. Mild only because she was right there in front of you giving him such a hard time. It's his rodeo, his problem to deal with IMO. You can set up your own boundaries with him about how much she can impinge on your time together. She is his problem. You're lucky that he took your interference well. He's an adult so it's his choice to deal with her effectively or not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This was going to happen.", "NTA she's a mess", "I came here prepared to say that you might be the AH even if you were factually correct, but based on the even-keeled nature of the quote and the fact that your BF did thank you afterward, you\u2019re NTA. You don\u2019t appear to have been unnecessarily unkind, you focused on defending your boyfriend\u2019s experience against a specific unjust accusation, and since you were all three in the same space conversing it\u2019s entirely reasonable for you to weigh in. \n\nSometimes it doesn\u2019t feel good when you say something difficult that needs to be said. Not delighting in the hurt feelings that happen when hard communicating is done is a sign of empathy, so it\u2019s not bad that you\u2019re feeling this way, or that your boyfriend is feeling his way.

That needs to stop because it's only hurting him.

I hope he appreciates you appropriately.", "100% agreed. I\u2019ve \u201cjoked\u201d about them needing couples therapy in the past. Before I knew him she had threatened suicide because her boyfriend wasn\u2019t answering her and neither was my boyfriend because he was at a concert. At the end of the concert he looked at his phone and panicked. She begged him to come over to help her. He did not do that but called 911 instead. She hasn\u2019t made any sort of threat like that since but I do think it freaked him out a bit. Which I totally get. I can\u2019t imagine feeling scared for my friend like that every time she gets upset. So I do think he has a soft spot from that. But that doesn\u2019t make it right. Girlie needs to get her shit together in my opinion and he needs to give her some tough love lol", "Yes I agree. The BF is the main problem here. He should have told his friend she was being too much, rather than constantly entertaining her need for attention while complaining to his GF.", "Yeah, he\u2019s tried talking to her about this several times in the past and any time he does she blows up on him or takes it entirely too personally. She needs a therapist to sort this stuff out, because he can\u2019t help her any further. He\u2019s nicely suggested that but it offends her. I really didn\u2019t want to get involved because you\u2019re right, it is definitely an issue between them. But hearing her say he was a bad friend because he can\u2019t be her therapist on demand struck a nerve with me I guess.", "Exactly this. The bf needs to be direct and talk to his friend rather than OP \"defending\" him. He isn't responsible for the friend 24/7, and he needs to speak to her about it rather than relying on OP to be thr bad guy and \"laying down the law\" on his behalf. It does a disservice to both OP and the friend for him to abdicate responsibility.", "Bad take", "\"Baby it seems like you are getting something out of all this negativity. When you figure out what you get out of it, then you'll know better how to stop it. Its not like she's calling and texting me plaguing me with her drama. She knows I'm not here for her like that.
