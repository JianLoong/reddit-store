I once left a note in a community college parking lot that just said \u201cnice parking asshole\u201d. I have wondered if that was too rude, certainly not clever, but I wouldn\u2019t worry about a softer toned and more to the point (I just insulted their parking and them, you actually specified how they were being inconsiderate) note like yours.

Previously I would have judged this person hard, until I had an injury that left me disabled for nearly a year.

Sometimes 2 wheels, sometimes all 4. Drove us nuts. I called the church and they denied it could possibly be their parishioners. The grass was getting badly torn up. I printed cards that said \u201cthis is not how Jesus would park\u201d and left them on the windshield of every car parked on our grass. The parishioners took the cards to the church leadership to complain about my rudeness and I got an apology call from the minister. He must have addressed it with them because it never happened again. \nShitty people don\u2019t change their shitty ways unless they get called on it.
