I asked my sister and my stepsister to be my bridesmaids. In an ideal world I would just have asked my sister. But she has been in our lives since we were young kids (she was 6 and my sister and I were 8 and 9 when we became stepsiblings) and she has always made an effort to be a sister to us. She's a good person and I don't dislike her. But I do not feel the same about her as I do my sister. To not make her feel like shit I included her as a bridesmaid and it made her so happy. She's been very present and involved, so has my sister. But there was something my sister and I always swore we would do before we'd get married, a true sister night in where we talk about our mom (who died when we were kids) and to mark the start of a new chapter in our lives. My sister brought it up to me, still wanting to do it, and I want to do it as well. \n\nBut my stepsister had asked if she could stay with one of us the week of the wedding. We told her she didn't need to come that early. She told us she didn't want to miss out and had already arranged to take the whole week off work. This means if she was with one of us she would be around when we would have the planned night and that would mean her seeing us do it but not being invited. My sister had asked dad if she could stay with him and his wife since they live closer than she does and explained why. Dad then called me and told me that if we did the night in we should include her because she's also our sister and also my bridesmaid. He told me she would be hurt to have the distinction made. I know he's not wrong. I had suggested she ask her mom about staying there but she said it would be more fun and she offered to pay for food and stuff.\n\nSo I know it would hurt her but I don't want her to be part of what has been talked about by my sister and me since we were teenagers thinking about what if we got married and how mom wouldn't see us get married or have kids. It's special between us. At the same time I would feel sad to miss out. But I know she wants us to be true sisters, with no difference between us and this would show that there is.\n\nWIBTA if I do this without her?\n\nAlso, my father's wife is labelled as such because she has repeatedly tried to shame my sister and me for making her feel like she's not our mom and for prioritizing honoring our mom over her (Mother's Day being the big one). For that reason she never graduated to more than dad's wife. I know that might be picked up on so there's your further info.", "created_utc": 1667218002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi9zij/wibta_if_i_do_something_special_with_just_my/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Option 3 - If you want a private party for just you & your sister do it before step-sister gets there. \n\nYour Dad & his wife are no factors in this situation\n\nedit correction\n\nETA - the event is what truly matters here, not the date.

You wish to celebrate together and speak of your deceased mom. Just because she is stepsister does not mean the 2 of you can\u2019t ever see each other 1-1. \n\nShe should have cleared the dates if she was planning on staying with you. It does not work. She should come at an agreed upon time or get a hotel.", "NTA\n\nI would just tell your stepsister that this was something you and your sister had always planned. That the only reason for your hesitance over her taking a week off (which to you is no gift, but it does she that she is making a big effort) was this one evening to celebrate your now-deceased mom, who can't be there at your wedding. \n\nI would also take your father aside and tell him what you are doing, and that you had planned this since you were children. Do you have a grandmother or aunt you can mention this to as well? The more family support, the better.\n\nIt is hard to imagine your stepsister being upset over a few hours during a week-long period. And if your stepmother says something or your father disagrees - you are adults now. You are allowed to make your own decisions. If people get upset, be prepared but I would do what you have planned. You will regret it and resent your stepfamily if you don't.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding! Please believe me when I tell you this is all a blip, and in a year or two what seemed like such a big hurdle pales in comparison to being happy with your husband. Good luck!!!", "NTA. Which ever one of you she stays with, just make sure she knows that on X night she'll be by herself and the host specifically goes to the other sister's house so she isn't seeing the get together in her face. If she asks why you are meeting up explain that it is a memorial type thing for your mother, not a bridesmaid thing so it is deeply personal regarding the loss of your mother. If she doesn't get that, then it's on her. But tell her ahead of time that you have had this pre-planned and won't change it, so she just needs to know that before she stays. There is no reason you need to call it a sisters night to her.", "NTA. No matter how nice your step sister may be, she does not share a mother with you and your sister. She should understand this and make herself scarce that evening without even having to be asked.", "NTA \n\nBut honestly that week of wedding is going to be hectic. Ever considered doing it the weekend before? \n\nI\u2019d just be honest with your stepsister and let her know this has been the plan for years and it\u2019s a night dedicated to your mom for you and your sister. She has her mom so she might not see how important this is for you but that\u2019s on her not you. \n\nYour dad has no say in this. Him thinking this is a dumb idea is just wrong and nothing needs to be discussed with him regarding this. Your dad\u2019s wife needs to accept she is not your mom. Shaming you and you sister for not prioritizing her wasn\u2019t going to get her very far with you and your sister. Forcing relationships is never successful.", "NTA. That is a great way to honor your mother. DO IT. DON\u2019T involve anyone else in that process. \n\nTell them all what you\u2019re doing and why. Tell them that you\u2019re honoring your mother and you expect them to respect that. \n\nTell your step sister that you love her but this is something that the two of you need to do together in honor of your mother. She should understand that her mother will be at her wedding but yours will not be at yours or your sisters.", "YWNBTA.  Tell her frankly that you will be having a night with your sister to remember your shared mother.  Tell her she needs to have plans that night.  It is not a Bachelorette party.  It is not sister bonding night.  Your mother not being at your wedding is heavy and you want to have a ritual, a remembrance before the wedding to honor her, so at the actual wedding you can just think of her fondly and without too much sadness.  No sane person will be hurt by this.  It is important to you.  Be forthright.   Accept no excuses or intrusions.  Good luck.", "OP, your stepsister has no business being included.  This is between you and your sister, as the only two who shared a mother and can remember/honor her.  The only option besides flat-out telling her NO is to maybe plan for your \"sister night\" early in the week, and she can come after the fact.  She doesn't belong there for it, and your father \\*should\\* realize that.\n\nNTA", "Update based on reply: NTA, having a day to remember your mother with her other child is fair to want. I think explaining that to step sis will be okay too. She might feel bummed to not be a part of everything because she seems very excited to support you however she can (even taking a week off work) but because of that excitement I also think she\u2019ll understand why it\u2019s something that has to just be you and bio sis \n\nI N F O: what do you plan to do on this sisters night? If it\u2019s literally something like having a memorial for your mother and telling stories about her I\u2019d say N T A and that step sis would probably be understanding why that was just the two of you. If it\u2019s gonna be just celebrating and just doing \u201csister\u201d things then Y T A and it would prove you don\u2019t see step sis as family", "NAH, just do your special thing the week before. Don't do it while she's there.  Easy!", "NAH\nI think you should communicate to your stepsister that you have private plans with your sister one evening to honour your mother. If she freaks out or feels upset that's on her, an adult.\n\nYou aren't leaving her out to be cruel.  I don't think it would be appropriate to have her come along when it's about remembering and honoring your mother who you lost. \n\nHer staying with one of you is a different issue.  Personally I believe no one should ask to stay with the bride the week of the wedding because it's overwhelming and stressful.  If your sister or you want to host her that's fine, if you don't that's also fine.", "YTA \n\nYou shouldn't have made her a bridesmaid because you felt obligated. Now she's going to feel way worse than how she would've felt if you just didn't make her a bridesmaid. Hope you're ready to have a tough conversation", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't focus on how you've planned this for years, but rather focus on how you are feeling --- your mom has been gone a long time but that doesn't make her absence hurt less. You wish she was there, and she can't be. You don't want to spend the wedding being sad that she isn't there, so you and your sister and dedicating time now to process all those feelings together. All the other \"sister stuff\" you have planned for that evening is self-care and honestly you don't need to tell people how you spend that night. \n\nThank your step-sister for being so willing to be on hand, and for her understanding in a bittersweet time.

The week of the wedding is hectic & chaotic, it can be very challenging to find times of peace & quiet.

I\u2019m concerned you & your sister will not have the right mind-set & environment to truly honor your Mom.", "Sometimes plans have to change a bit. I think the best option here, so that no feelings are hurt and that no one feels excluded, is to have it the weekend before step-sister is coming.
