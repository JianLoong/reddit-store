From what I've seen at weddings  those bouquet tosses are a free for all open to all the unmarried women. (I'm a guy so I've never participated but that seems to be the tradition.) You are an unmarried woman. Period. You live with your partner who happens to be a woman. Your family needs to wake up to the fact that it's the 21st century and realize that you can get legally married to her in every one of the 50 states and most of the rest of the first world.

Nothing anyone complained about makes any sense. You are allowed a +1, the bride and groom specifically allowed it knowing who the +1 was and were excited to have you. The bride and groom made it clear to you couples wear matching clothing. You gave a very nice and appropriate gift by doing free photography. The bride clearly wanted you and the gf in the bouquet toss which means she knew you might catch it. Another guest even let go of it so you could have it. All the \"dont wear matching clothing, come alone, etc\" comments would be in direct opposition to the wishes of the bride & groom. All of these people suddenly know better what the bride & groom want than they do themselves? Any complaint at all about this is just homophobia.

Hateful is right but doesn't do their attitude justice.", ">Forget sexuality, a couple sharing food in some way that's getting multiple glances sounds icky.\n\nGiven the other homophobic behaviours that OP's family displayed, there's a high likelihood that OP was getting those looks *because* of her sexuality.\n\nThink about it - OP's family is offended by anything that broadcasts that she's in a relationship with a woman. They attended as a couple and her family felt the need to warn the bride. They wore matching clothes per the invite and that was apparently offensive. They danced together like other couples and that was apparently offensive. They laughed at the silliness of one partner catching the \"you're married next!\" bouquet and that was apparently offensive. \n\nSo it is perfectly consistent that ANY behaviour which suggests they're in a relationship, such as sharing food, would be seen as offensive by those assholes. \n\nI doubt OP shared food in any uniquely gross way. She likely acted the same as any other couple who wants to let the other person try a bite of food. The issue was that the other half of that couple was (*gasp*) also a woman. I bet if OP had dared to kiss her girlfriend, her family would have lost their collective minds - not because they were having a sloppy makeout, but because they dared to behave like straight couples and show affection in public instead of hiding their relationship as if it's something to be ashamed of.\n\n**ETA:** when I (a straight woman) go to weddings with my boyfriend, we coordinate what colour his tie will be with my dress. We dance together. We sometimes share a bite from our plate with the other person. We've even kissed. And no one has freaked out like OP's family did. The reason why is pretty obvious.", "There is no doubt that there's a bunch of paranoid and homophobic people involved here. That's why OP isnt the asshole and the other's are. \n\nBut - a person can be in a same sex couple and still be an asshole. Just as a heterosexual couple can be assholes. People takes bites off each other's plates all the time, be it friends or siblings or whatever. Nothing eye catching about that - same sex couple or not. But it's odd to mention sharing food as attracting a lot of glares from people. No matter the make up of the couple there are for sure times when 'sharing food' can be eye roll worthy.", "NTA fuck all those homophobes; I'm amazed you're even in contact with most of them", "INFO: does your family know that the bouquet isnt magical and does not actually determine who is going to get married next?", "Your family is abusive and homophobic and it\u2019s disgusting.
