But don't agree with it. I think maybe not asshole, but unintentionally gauche.", "I'm sorry, wait, the only negative feedback I'm hearing is from your parents and your sister. You got some looks (which may or may not have been dirty or just surprised), but... the guests were friendly to you as a photographer, the bride and groom reaffirmed their wish to see you there, the person who grabbed the bouquet with you happily handed it to you...\n\nWHY is your family making this your problem? Why did they not approach someone from the married couple's bridal party to let them know people were making threats to confront two of their guests? Why did your sister and your parents all not only listen to, but feel it was necessary to *pass on* some truly *dumbass* comments about grandchildren (you're **both women**. You could provide **twice** the number of grandkids if you chose to!) from total strangers???\n\nWhether this was just your family or really was guests as well, my heart hurts for you. You were behaving exactly the same as any other couple there, you did not deserve to hear or experience any of this. NTA.", "NTA. People can be so ridiculous and mean. Ignore it and well done you for catching the bouquet!", "I wanna dislike your post because so many people were butt to you\n\nI'm so sorry, and I will be flamming if are of my gay mate's experience what you did at my wedding \n\nYou and your gf are no way arse hole and did nothing wrong", "What the actual homophobic sh!tshow did I just read about? I am so sorry OP that your family consists of a bunch of discriminatory non-tolerant meatballs", "MTA and I think it's your sister is the only one that had the problem. You might need to have a sit-down with her and find out how much of a homo she is.", "NTA. But your family seems homophobic. Their \u201ctraditional\u201d beliefs are outdated. Wishing you and your girlfriend the best.", "Truly. \u201cBeing a normal person while lesbian\u201d isn\u2019t a crime people. \n\nSo sad seeing all of these wedding posts where people pander to the bigots.", "Yea why is the blame always on the queer person for existing, and never on the obnoxious bigots who make a huge fuss over nothing and bring all the negativity??", "My 11 year old cousin caught the bouquet at my wedding, I\u2019ve never heard this seriously considering marriage rule before.", "NTA, one of my friends had a bouquet that fall apart mid-flight so we all got a small bouquet. This tradition is only fun if it isn't taken seriously.", "That\u2019s really sweet and means a lot :) she and I appreciate it", "I mean, they believe she and her gf are being lesbians *at* them just by existing, so I wouldn't put it past them.", "Apparently she was jealous, because of me being gay she was getting loads of praise for being the \u201cgood straight daughter with a man\u201d and wanted to keep the attention going with the bouquet", "We both wore light blue which looked really good (especially on her) the bride was really lovely and the groom was polite so I don\u2019t think there was any issue there.", "This makes me think of basketball style battles for it \ud83d\ude02 maybe at my wedding", "Yeah that\u2019s not drawing attention to yourself at all, that is very normal behavior. I am so sorry your family is treating you and your gf this way.", "Good, at least some people can be good. Hope you still had a good time even with all that.", "I\u2019ve caught about three or four bouquets and I\u2019m 39 and still single.  Oh well.", "Your sister is jealous and tried the old \u201csome people have been talking\u201d, some people usher, she\u2019s been talking", "Oh absolutely agree: I\u2019ve met some right assholes in the community. We where sharing food when I was deleting blurry photos from my camera and my gf fed me some cake off a fork as both my hands where occupied.", "My 11 yo goddaughter caught mine/// Such a BIG smile <3", "how can you be 21, if you made a post one year ago saying you were 19?\n\nweird.", "NTA. This sounds like homophobia to me. Definitely your family and other weddings guests are the As.", "NTA. Your family is homophobic. You didn't do anything wrong. I'm sorry.", "NTA.  Have yet to go anyplace, weddings, bars, parties, etc. where two or more women aren\u2019t dancing together.  It\u2019s so commonplace with everyone I know.", "You are not TA. These homophobic jerks, however, are major assholes.", "NTA. That\u2019s all horrifyingly homophobic. You weren\u2019t doing anything to cause drama, the people treating you so poorly were.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t know much about the history of the bridal bouquet throw, but from my perspective, it\u2019s just a fun tradition and no one cares how long you\u2019ve been with your partner. If you were single, would your sister expect you to purposely not catch it then, too?\n\nI\u2019m sorry you and your gf had to deal with this, OP. It sounds like a rough night.", "NTA. Sounds like a bunch of homophobes, plain and simple.", "NTA. Good lord, your sister and her boyfriend suck and are jealous homophobes.\n\nI also have an asshole sister, if you want to join my club, we meet on Wednesdays and I\u2019ll make cookies.", "YTA", "The guests where friendly when I was photographing as they didn\u2019t know I was with my gf as i was walking around largely on my own while she sat in the pews. Many guests shook their heads at us or obviously whispered behind their hands. grooms mother told the bride to not keep photographs that included us within earshot of my dad who repeated this to me. The nice gust who gave me the bouquet was apparently the brides mother which I feel bad for not knowing lol. \n\nWith the dancing I think they wanted to avoid any drama and I have a take no shit policy if somebody confronts me and was already starting to get pissed off with the looks.", "Why?", "YOU KNOW WHY. DON'T HAVE ME SPELL IT OUT.", "My sister is 16 years older than me, and I was 5 or 6 when I caught the bouquet at her wedding. I was DEVASTATED that I had to give it back so they could redo the whole thing. But as an adult I'm just wondering why anyone let me out there to begin with??", "OP, it sounds like you\u2019re in a very loving relationship, congratulations.  I\u2019m so sorry your family can\u2019t see what a blessing that is.", "NTA now you know who isn\u2019t gonna be invited to your future wedding", "These aren\u2019t traditional beliefs they are highly homophobic mentalities. Your parents sound homophobic as do your sibling and her boyfriend.\n\nThe catching of the bouquet isn\u2019t that serious. It\u2019s intended for anybody single\u2014 hell, I even participated at my cousins wedding when I was 16 because so what? It\u2019s intended as a fun activity that doesn\u2019t need to be taken soooo seriously. If anything they\u2019re probably just jealous because with both you and your girlfriend participating, you get a higher shot at catching something, haha\n\nI really hope your family changes their attitude. You and your girlfriend don\u2019t deserve such discrimination from people who are supposed to love and support you.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your family sucks. You will never be the asshole for just existing.", "Man, F' them all. You stuck to the dress code. You caught the bouquet.  Big freaking deal. NTA.  They're all trying to hide their homophobia under some weird \"protect the old folks!\" crap.", "NTA\n\n>I shouldn\u2019t have caught it as we weren\u2019t long term.\n\nIs your sister aware that the bouquet thing is a haha your next vibe and not like binding law or something. You aren't actually preventing a couple from getting engaged. Seems like a lot of people in your life are homophobic. But like the kind that pat themselves on the back because they haven't publicly stoned you so that means they are progressive. As a general rule don't take social cues from these people. They will always think you're TA because gay.", "NTA. No explanation needed.", "Hahahaha no. Bride gave permission for you to come as a couple Homophobes are their own problem. Most people should care who you have sex with. Your sisters a jerk to make it your problem, and so are your parents. You don't have to hide and if they aren't on your side, f them. NTA", "NTA. The tradition of the toss is all single woman participate. The flowers are up for grabs.  It signals who catches the flowers will be the next one to be married. If you don't want certain people to play. She should have only call curtain people to join or spoke to you before and ask you not to participate.  Tell he to go pound salt to get her frustrations out", "I designed mine to do that - I unwrapped the main ribbon and it split into three smaller ones, two for my two flower girls and one for a friend who was getting married two months after me. They were the only three I had come up - we didn\u2019t have many single people there in general and I always hated going through that (got married quite a bit older than average). Everybody won, in my opinion.", "My daughter caught the boquet at my husband's, cousin's wedding.   They made her give it back.  Smdh.  NTA", "Spell it out.", "well. one year ago op said they were 19 and in this post said 21\n\nSO I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY ARE SO HELL BENT ON TURNING THIS INTERNET PAGE INTO A HOUSE OF LIES TBQHWY!!!!\u00a1!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Lol", "thank you xx", "NTA. The bride and groom had no problem so you were not messing up THEIR day. Tell Every one else they can just butt out.", "NTA\n\nHow homophobic these people are! You don't have to or should ever need to hide yourself away. How shameful of all of them. I'm sorry you are having to deal with all of that. Just know you and your gf did nothing wrong.", "Nta", "NTA.  You did nothing to draw unneeded attention to yourself.  Your behavior was completely normal and appropriate for a wedding guest.  What was unneeded is the homophobic relatives and their allies -- the family members who supposedly support you but are criticizing you for being yourself openly.  Shame on them!", "Her family is trying to make the bride and groom's family as an excuse to hide their own homophobia. I bet that no \"drunk relative of the groom\" was doing any objection, it's just them.\n\nOP, DON'T SHRINK YOURSELF OR DISRESPECT YOUR PARTNER. \n\nNTA but you will be if you don't tell them clearly that you won't enable their bigotry.", "Yes, it's not like catching it actually has any impact on  current or future reality. Please tell me that people know that this is a meaningless fun tradition and it makes zero difference to who is getting married next.", "At my wedding we skipped the bouquet toss and did an anniversary dance. The couple together the longest got the flowers. It was of fun. My in laws won the flowers.", "NTA. Also it sounds like your sister, her boyfriend and others in your family are homophobic. I\u2019d be careful for the future and then causing issues.", "NTA. I caught my cousins bouquet when I was about 10 or 11 and was told to give it back so she could throw it again. Some people are just uptight. I've been NC with that side of the family for a decade.", "If the Bride & Groom are fine, you're fine. And in some circumstances, even if they weren't, you'd be fine.", "Nta", "NTA. Your family seem like the type that blame you for your attention seeking ways just for breathing!!!\n....oh clutching their  pearls, how could she dare show up to celebrate a loving occasion with her girlfriend and dare to be happy? Oh I feel faint! They smiled,\n danced, and had fun!!! Gasp.../s\n\nI wish you and your girlfriend much happiness!  Enjoy making memories together. But more importantly, enjoy choosing a new family of friends that support you both and all the fabulous you have to offer. \nAnd I'd make potpourri with the bouquet you caught. It's obviously sooo important that your sister has it. Afterall she can't possibly get married without the most recent brides wedding bouquet, it's like a law....\nCourse I may forget to make it smell nice. I'm petty like that.", "\"They asked me to ball, I balled.\"", "Okay this is adorable and made me smile."]}
