My son (20) is my step-son, and I have a daughter (14) with my wife (we've been married for 16 years). He has gone off to university, and when he left, we bought a van and began to go on trips around the country with my daughter.\n\nHe has been at university for 1.5 years now, and my wife and I decided we would love to take our daughter abroad for a magical Christmas. We booked to go to Tenerife with her for 10 days to get away from the cold. \n\nWe didn't invite my step-son as he is a fully grown adult and likely wants to do his own thing. \n\nWe got back today, however, and he didn't come home as we expected, he stayed in his uni accommodation alone over the Christmas period. He said his friends all went home to their families, and he didn't want to be sat at our home alone so he just stayed there.\n\nMy wife and I are now feeling some guilt, and feel perhaps we should have invited him. We had imagined he would travel back to our house and spend some time with his local school friends here, but he now seems like he's in a depressive mood and we're unsure what to do with him. We've invited him back now, but he has said he just wants to stay away and has refused to engage at all.", "created_utc": 1672333074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zya5z1/aita_for_leaving_my_20_year_old_son_at_home_for/", "score": 1360, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You waited until he was out of the house to start taking family trips - the message that sends to him is that you don't, and have never, seen him as family and were just biding your time until he was out of the way so that you could do fun things with your \"real\" child. On top of that, NO ONE bothered to ask him if he might want to go with you or if he had someone to spend Christmas with - you just packed up the only people you see as family and deserted him.\n\nOf course he's refusing to engage; he now knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that you don't see him as family, don't care about him, and don't want him around. Why the fuck would he, or anyone, want to engage with you after that?\n\nETA: The more I think about it, the more my heart breaks for him. I really wish I could give him a hug, invite him to be part of my family, and reassure him that there's nothing wrong with him - that he just got shitty parents.", "YTA.\n\nSo you waited until your son left for college and started vacationing and traveling without him?\n\n>when he left, we bought a van and began to go on trips around the country with my daughter.\n\n>we would love to take our daughter abroad for a magical Christmas.\n\nYou're doing everything with the daughter and don't even invite him? You really expected him to be in a empty house for Christmas while his family lied on a sunny beach and be OK with it?\n\nHe's depressed, *big surprise*, since it must have felt like a hammer to the head the realization that his parents simply don't care about him. \n\nTalk about preferred child...\n\nEdit: thanks kind strangers for the awards, my first time getting it. I'm just sad for it's reason. I hope the Son it's OK and gets the love and support he deserves somewhere.", "No shit he's depressed, his family abandoned him ~~at Christmas.~~ .\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou have a \\*college-aged\\* kid and decided to exclude him from a \"magical Christmas\" family vacation? He's still family. And you did this without even \\*asking\\* him whether he wanted to go?\n\nI think you did this because he's a stepchild and you feel no sense of obligation to him.", "YTA\n\nI am 25 and my parents always ask me for family holidays. (They won't even go if I can't go, but I am not even saying you should have done that). He is part of your family and you went for 10 days on a family vacation without even inviting him. That's cruel.\n\nBesides, you abandoned him **for Christmas**. Of course he is going to be hurt. Why would he want to spend Christmas alone?", "YTA. You didn\u2019t bother to ask stepson if he wanted to go on a \u201cmagical Christmas abroad\u201d with his family because you knew the answer would be yes. \n\nHe\u2019s in college and still coming home on breaks, you should\u2019ve treated him like he\u2019s still a part of your family. This seems like a clear case of having a favorite child. Your stepson is right to be sad/disappointed", "You know what they say about assuming right...?\n\nYTA for not communicating with your stepson about this.\n\nYou never did anything like this as a family when he was a child, and then once he is out of the house you plan a *\\*magical\\** holiday for your (clearly) prefered child...\n\n& of course it's your *step*son...", "YTA you left him out of not just one adventure but all of the adventures you took since he started university.  Tenerife is just the tip of the ice berg because he gets to sit at home while you all have fun.\n\nStarting these trips right as he leaves sends a message that the daughter is the favorite and that you didn\u2019t want him to partake in any of these experiences.  It\u2019s no wonder he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you both.  Do better.", "YTA. You ASSumed he would want to do his own thing. He\u2019s at university, he\u2019s not a 25 year old adult living on his own.\n\nEdited to add:  Even if he was a 25 year old adult living on his own, why wouldn\u2019t you invite him on the holiday vacation? Instead you just leave him alone. Over Christmas.", "YTA. You expected him to come home, but didn't bother to ask if he wanted to be with his family on Christmas (who was now going to be on a trip?).\n\nI'd have the same reaction as he did.", "YTA \n\nThat\u2019s one way to make sure he knows he\u2019s not a part of your family at all. The trip itself and just the complete lack of communication and effort in general", "INFO; Did you mention the vacation to him at all in the planning stages, or just leave him out completely?", "YTA - feeling \u201csome\u201d guilt? For never doing anything for or with him for a holiday, waiting for him to move out and then deciding that now is the time to spoil YOUR daughter with trips and magical christmases. \n\nGee I wonder why he\u2019s upset.", "Honestly, YTA. He is an adult, but he's only 20 in college. Most other students go home to their families for Christmas. It could have easily been avoided with a conversation just letting him know you plans and if he'd like to join. You could then make adjustments together around that. The way you handled it would have made him feel excluded and not an important part of your family anymore.", "YTA. You left him alone on christmas. A time people usually spend with their familiy. To him, this shows that you don't view him as family because you didn't even bother to invite him to the trip. You should be thinking of ways to make it up to him and it better be a holiday trip payed by you.", "YTA. You decided what his response would be without asking him the question and sent the message that he is not a complete member of your family. Lots of evil step parent vibes can result from that.", "INFO: Did you even bother to ask him if he'd like to be included in this family vacation?\n\nEdit, I re-read, and no, you did not. Massive YTA.", "YTA.\n\nThe lack of communication is astonishing - how did not one person in your family consider the very basic option of ASKING HIM if he would like to join?\n\nThere\u2019s no excuses here.", "YTA big time.  Your son was 4 when you married your wife.  Have you always made him feel like an outsider? The very least you should have done is ASK him if he had wanted to come - letting him know he shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to say yes.  You all utterly abandoned him.  You and your wife both suck", "Seriously, what the *fuck*? Is this real life? You literally left him alone on Christmas while you took his sister on an all-expense paid vacation. Of course YTA\n\nI would bet a lot of money that you're still planning on doing Christmas things with your daughter when she's 20", "YTA for having a family trip without a family member. You were very thoughtless and cruel", "YTA\n\nObviously he\u2019s distancing from you all since he has been openly abandoned. Just because he\u2019s an adult doesn\u2019t mean he has no feelings or won\u2019t want to spend time with family. Throughout the post it\u2019s all about you and what you think, nothing was done to sought his opinion by anyone. Don\u2019t be surprise he no longer consider you all as family soon", "YTA, of course he doesn't want to come back now. The 'real' family goes on a Magical Christmas\u2122 vacation and you all just assumed he'd hang out with friends while staying at your empty house? Geez man, thats cold.", "Wow.\n\nYTA\n\nAdult or not, people don't typically just want to \"do their own thing\" at Christmas. You didn't think to even tell him about the trip, or invite him? He is no doubt feeling left out, and like he doesn't belong in the same way as the child you two have together. \n\nYou two abandoned him on Christmas, no shit he's depressed.", "YTA - I'm just imagining the conversations he'll have with his friends when they get back...\n\nFriend: how were your holidays?\n\nKid: ehh, i just stayed here...\n\nFriend: oh yeah? Why didn't you go home at all?\n\nKid: well, my family all went to Tenerife without me sooooo...", "Yta.  Even if he did have his own plans and didn't want to come, that should have been his choice. \nYou could have offered at the very least.", "YTA: You didn't even ask or try to include him.", "YTA.  Yes, he is an adult, but he is only 20 and a student.  It sounds like he anticipated spending the holidays with his FAMILY, and in turn his family left him behind.  I'm having a hard time understanding why you would think he'd want to come home to an empty house for Christmas.  You should have at least extended an offer for him to go with.", "Yeah, bit YTA.\n\nYou didn't bother to even ask or check? If it's a family trip and bringing the daughter, rather rude to ignore the son especially at CHRISTMAS.", "You didn't even **ask** him if he wanted to go??!!!\n\nYTA", "YTA instead of presuming you should have talked to him", "YTA for sure. I actually had to re-read it because I was like \u201csurely they invited him or at least told him what they were up to\u201d", "YTA congrats on alienating your son", "YTA.. it really wouldn\u2019t have been difficult or cost you guys anything to ask him about whether he wanted to join and not just assumed he had plans.\n\nI hope he realises it\u2019s just you guys who are shitty people and that it in no way reflects on him or thinks it\u2019s his fault you guys didn\u2019t invite him.", "YTA - should have at least asked him and not assumed. 20 aged college student is still 'at home'.", "YTA - even if he is \u201cgrown,\u201d he is still your child and part of your family. What the hell would a phone call/conversation have cost you? Especially since you assumed that he would come home. Why would he want to stay in the house alone and be constantly reminded that his family didn\u2019t care enough to even offer him the opportunity to go away with them? Now you\u2019re feeling some guilt???! You and your wife are both assholes and don\u2019t be shocked if he never comes back to your home because you\u2019ve obviously decided that he is no longer a part of your family that you should worry about because he\u2019s \u201cgrown.\u201d SMH", "YTA, my heart breaks a little seeing how well he behaved he handled the whole thing. I can't for the life of me understand why you wouldn't just have invited him. There's a reason as to why the number of suicides skyrocket during the holidays. Don't brush this off.", ">my wife and I decided we would love to take our daughter abroad for a magical Christmas.\n\nINFO: Why wouldn't you include your stepson?  Wouldn't he also want to experience a \"magical\" Christmas with the family?  \nWas there any other family for him to see during the holiday season?\n\nEDIT:  OP, I just realized that this was the first vacation your family has taken.

Seriously? How obtuse can you be?", "YTA. That\u2019s it you know you screwed up and your wife is worse bc that\u2019s her child yet she left him at the holidays.", "YTA.  You need to include him in all Christmas plans until he is married, and then you should still invite him and the spouse.  Leaving a young family member alone for a major holiday is mean.", "YTA.    You are selfish and unkind.    You've been in that boy's life since he was able to form lasting memories and you treated him like he was garbage.", "YTA. What\u2019s wrong with both you and your wife!? You didn\u2019t even ask him? Why would he want to come back and see friends who are busy with family when his own family abandoned him?", "YTA that poor guy had to spend Christmas alone while you took your blatantly favorite child on vacation?

OMG\nYou didn\u2019t even ask him his holiday plans. Are you even a dad? And his mother WTF. She ought to be ashamed of herself for letting her son be treated like a second class citizen in your family. you travel with your daughter on trips all around but ignore your son.  You ought to feel some \u201cguilt now \u201c because you Are AWFUL parents. i can\u2019t imagine how he felt being all alone in an empty dorm because he has such shitty parents.  You both SUCK!!", "YTA \n\nLet me get this straight. You got home today after a vacation and you're surprised your son isn't there? You ditched him on Christmas. At no point did you even talk to him to see if he wanted to see you or go on the trip. Shame on you and your wife.", "YTA. Why on earth didn\u2019t you invite him? He can\u2019t afford that trip on his own- he\u2019s a student. You are treating him like he\u2019s not your son. He\u2019s going to not want a relationship with you if you treat your daughter so much better than him. \n\nOP get tickets for you and him to go somewhere special over spring break (to make up for this holiday), and in future invite him on all family trips.

Your son is still family but you didn\u2019t include him in a family trip. Even if he were a full adult, you would still ASK him if he wants to come along, even if he pays for part or all of it himself (which he would be unable to do as a college student now duh). \nI think the real reason you didn\u2019t ask is bc you didn\u2019t want to pay for him. And that makes you an AH too. \nDon\u2019t be surprised if he distances from you all from now on.", "YTA!!! Are you kidding!!! It doesn\u2019t matter how old he is you abandoned him on Christmas. Why would he want to go home and sit by himself? Dude get a grip.", "YTA. A 20-year-old college student isn't exactly a \"fully grown adult.\" Not in the way that a 35-year-old married father of three might be. If it were the latter, you wouldn't be an AH for leaving your son out of the family trip since he has his own family to spend Christmas with. But as it is, come on, you can't really expect us to believe you genuinely thought he'd prefer to be at your house *alone on Christmas* and see a few friends from home than go on the trip. You should have invited him. I'd be depressed too if it were me.", "YTA for not even inviting him on the trip to begin with, and even worse for leaving him *alone.* There is *no* age limit to go on a family trip, especially a holiday one.", "YTA. What a horrible thing to do to your child.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t even ask him! And the fact that all the trips and fun adventures started immediately after he left for university says a lot.

Your child doesn\u2019t stop being your child when they turn 18.

Of course he wants to stay away. You\u2019ve made him feel unwelcome. My heart hurt for him reading this. \n\nAt bare minimum you always make sure your kids know they\u2019re wanted.

Fine, but the mother? That's something else.\n\nYou didn't even bothered to ask...\n\nBut now he knows where he stands, so that is fine, I think. Maybe it would have been easier if you just told him to fuck off... evenly rude, but more direct. \n\nGoing on holidays with your daughter, leaving him out and then going abroad and leaving him out again?

She usually even wants to pay for the hotel etc wich she really shouldn't but wont take no for an answer. Should parents just forget about their children once they become \"abults\"?", "Man, I didn't do the math and I wish I hadn't read that. Incredibly sad.", "And they waited until he left for uni before traveling with the daughter. So, it makes it sound like they never wanted to treat him to vacations even as a kid.", "I suspect you\u2019re right and it\u2019s breaking my heart for that poor boy", "It seems so deliberately cruel. \"Quick, the boy is out the house! Now we can finally be a family!\"\n\nI just can't get over how OP pictures him sitting alone in the family home (the clue is in the name) over Christmas. Did OP want him there so they could tell him all about their exciting trip as soon as they got back? Was he meant to sit there with the fairy lights on watching Christmas films filled with happy families? What the hell was the plan?\n\nI just don't get it. I hope OP's son goes on to create his own family and excludes OP and his happy little family from it.", "Exactly. Left him alone on purpose AND thought he'd be happy about it. I mean, whyever would he be upset? OP and his family had a lovely holiday. \n\nWhat a collossal cockthistle this guy is.", "Exactly, I was 20 years old when my parents took me on vacation during christmas to my mom's home country. I was a college student and still relied on them monitarily so there was no question that I would go with them. It breaks my heart when some parents think that just because the kid is over 18 and in college that they're not included anymore.", "Yeah. I would like to treat it this way with my daughter and (hopefully) her eventual family. As she gets more established, I might expect her to contribute a bit to the budget, but I want to ensure she always has the option to spend time with us, if she chooses.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine just being \u201chey, if you come back over holiday break, we won\u2019t be here. Key is under the mat, lol.\u201d", "I'm so sorry, that must've really hurt.", "She was probably big on consequences too. Funny how that door swings both ways.", "Wrong. Op is clearly UK based. This is the common way we refer to that popular holiday destination.", "????\n\nThats a real place, dude. It's not Hogwarts.", "My parents are both my bios, and did this type of stuff to me. I speak with them as little as possible.", "Obviously mom too. I am seriously so angry for this kid!", "I am livid for him\u2026 and you. Wth is wrong with people to think this is ok? I\u2019m not violent, but honestly I\u2019d love to smack some sense into them. \ud83d\ude21\n\nThese parents will be like, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what he doesn\u2019t talk to us any more or visit\u201d. \ud83d\ude44", "I am so sorry", "But it is a tradition now, we can\u2019t do that", "while i know for a fact a lot of parents actually think like that and yes, would do exactly that, even they would at the very least have asked the son to join them when they were planning what clearly was a family vacation. \n\ni mean, if this was a romantic getaway for the parents while some relative or neighbour or god knows who made sure the 14 year old didn't kill herself by setting the house on fire than no problem, but doing what is clearly a family vacation, **over christmas** and delibaretly not even asking the son to join in even though he lives at university, so probably only sees them during the holiday season is an enormous asshole move...", "The OP uses uni and not college too, so very likely UK based", "It sounds like he's from the UK or thereabouts, based on the wording OP used."]}
