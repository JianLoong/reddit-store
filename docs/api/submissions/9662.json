He's here for help.", "Eeewwwwwwwww \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd2e YTA", "Holy fuck.", "YOU don\u2019t put them in the laundry you asshole, you expect her to do it! Do your own shitty laundry. I say this as someone whose partner does her laundry for the most part; I would be mortified if I was you.", "Info-do you wipe until there\u2019s no more poop or is it as thorough as your hand washing?", ">I am hairy there and sometimes yeah \n\n\n#SO WASH _YOUR_ bloody ASS!!\n##With soap AND water \n\nIt's your butt, isn't it? Are you disgusted by cleaning yourself properly?", "Oh no! \ud83e\udd2e", "YTA\n1. You should be washing your hands for AT LEAST 20 seconds to actually remove dirt, grime and bacteria.\n2. Who doesn\u2019t shower before bed!? Especially if you have poopoo stains on your boxers. It\u2019s like saying it\u2019s normal if a girl has them. No you would be disgusted learn how to wipe your ass or purchase baby wipes. \n3. Just because you shower in the morning doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re clean when you get in bed you\u2019re getting the sheets dirty m\n4. Would you want to wash your clothes with someone else\u2019s poop stains?\n5. She\u2019s your gf not your wife love how you brought up your mom \ud83d\udc80", "Thank you for clarifying. I\u2019m still trying to figure out how you get skid marks on any upper body clothing, but I was thinking like sweater vests, or a vest that would be worn over a dress shirt in combination with/instead of a dress jacket. Still a massive hygiene issue for OP.", "Maybe it's because I wear one for work, but I just assumed was a work thing.", "What is a vest called then?", "American here. Figured out what a vest was, no problem. Two countries separated by a common language, yah dah.", "Ohhhh I see.  I guess this means the armpits are an issue as well.  Jesus Christ.\n\nOP, I\u2019m gonna level with you.  I work in surgery and see so many bodies. You probably have a perfect storm of genetics, body hair, and overactive sweat glands that make you prone to strong BO.  It\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s manageable.  Wash your own underwear and vests.  I doubt you\u2019ve inspected your drawers as thoroughly as your gf, and it\u2019s honestly much grosser that you would rather blackmail her than handle your own shit, metaphorically speaking, of course.", "Hang on, what do other people call tank tops then?", "Can someone explain to me the insane amount of grown men who don\u2019t realize they need to wipe their ass until it\u2019s clean?? It\u2019s not just wipe as in singular.", "Mud pie", "Same! But mine works at the airport, and it ruins both our regular clothes to wash mixed in with his work clothes. Underwear is always washed separately as well.", "On the forehead.", "I didn't say there wasn't. Notice that I didn't give a judgement.  Just stated facts.", "Shit streaks! Shit streaks on his underpants, all the time and he thinks its ok", "A lot of guys don't even bother with turning the sink on...it's quite scary actually...", "Ugh. We Americans have a truly unfortunate name for ribbed, mens undershirts/tank tops. I prefer every other country\u2019s variation.", "Ooooh. A singlet in the States, on the other hand, is like what Olympic wrestlers wear. Vest here is like a waistcoat but it's outerwear, so it's worn like a coat or jacket. \n\nThis actually clears up a fair bit of confusion from my time in New Zealand \ud83d\ude02", "Fellow kiwi here, I was wondering why the vests (what we think vests are) were also being removed from the main wash and not the clothes he wore under them. I was also wondering why he had so many vests lol.", "My partner is from NZ and I'm from the US. We were just talking the other day about how NZ English is mostly British, but also gets a pick from American English in addition to unique NZ English words.", "Well I mean, probably less skid marks and more just...if she has to dress up her washing his ass properly *for him* as \"foreplay\" to get him clean enough she can stand to have sex with him, he's probably not washing the rest of himself thoroughly either. Good odds he's not using a proper/proper amount of antiperspirant either, just dousing himself in bodyspray.\n\nedit: small addition", "They're probably just really gross.", "I'm wondering if OP doesn't change his undershirts often enough so they're all sweat-stained.", "Probably not skid marks, but some men keep undershirts for way too long. I had to fight with my husband to throw out his nasty yellow undershirts that used to be white. He insisted they were still good, but even if I used hot water and strong detergent, there s still seemed to be some kind of oily residue on them.", "Yeah. I worked at a recycling facility for awhile. Only time I've ever puked due to a bad smell was there. We got filthy.\n\nMy gf never had any complaints though, because I'm a fucking adult.", "It wasn't hygiene man's sweat is just toxic.", "Let me tell you the story that has haunted and disturbed me about the hygiene of *some* men.\n\nBack when I worked in restaurants, I walk into the kitchen one day and there are 5 guys working and making jokes about \u201cdick cheese\u201d like this is just a universally accepted thing.\n\nFinally another guy walks in and asks them what the heck \u201cdick cheese\u201d is.\n\nI did not know this group of men could actually be embarrassed by anything, but they shrank as this man sat there and explained to them all, in a very concerned tone, that they did not know how to shower properly.", "Bruh. My thong is literally UP MY ASS CRACK all day and somehow doesn\u2019t come out with poo streaks. It\u2019s not that hard to wipe until your toilet paper is clean, or perhaps invest in flushable wipes. It is not normal for there to be poo streaks in your undies. \n\nYTA for expecting your gf to wash your streaky undergarments, and YTA to yourself for not properly cleaning your bootyhole.", "We wash clothes even though they don\u2019t have visible dirt on them, right? For most people washing their underwear is similar. It was on their body so it gets washed\u2026not because it\u2019s been soiled like yours apparently are.", "Dude, I am a guy. My underwear just smells of sweat at the end of the day. That's it. That's why it needs washing.", "My husband never has had any stains wtf \ud83d\ude2d", "after the age of like, 5, i have never once had streaks in my underwear. you are revolting and i dont know why she\u2019s still with you especially since she basically has to trick you into showering", "\ud83d\ude02 buddy you are like a real life foul bachelor frog. Learn to use the bidet properly. Honestly I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re using it and coming out more unclean. Use and dry your ass thoroughly. Bidets are amazing. I can\u2019t imagine having one and not using it. Does your ass itch? I bet it itches.", "If it\u2019s gotten to the point of your GF refusing to do your laundry and supervising your showers and even washing your ass for you, you don\u2019t have light boo-boo marks. \n\nYou\u2019re 32 years. A grown ass adult. If your brother has this issue as well like you claim, your mom completely failed to teach y\u2019all how to wipe your ass properly. Every one has booty holes that work the same way. There are no different anatomies between men and women.\n\nIt\u2019s sad and gross I\u2019m putting this on here but Here\u2019s a hint: wipe your ass, fold the paper and wipe again with a clean spot. Grab new tissue and wipe until there is no poo on the toilet paper. If you need more than what you pulled, get some more. Invest in some toilet wipes (don\u2019t flush them though). When you shower, wash your entire body first with a **wash rag**, and then scrub your ass and get between the cheeks. Swipe like a credit card.\n\nWhen you wash your hands, wash them every time you use the bathroom. If your hands smell so bad that she thinks you\u2019re not washing (and because you constantly have boo-boo stains), I\u2019m gonna assume you got an itchy ass and you itch it. If you itch your ass or balls, wash your hands. Say your ABCs twice, get under your fingernails, between your fingers, and scrub up to mid arm.\n\nJust STOP trying to normalize and justify shit stains in your underwear. Yes, it can happen to anyone on occasion. Occasion meaning hardly ever, NOT 3 times a week. Grow up, accept that you have poor hygiene, and take accountability.", "Use baby wipes dude. No excuse.", "Dude, *over, under, in-between, 20 seconds to get them clean*. Preschool kids know to actually properly wash your hands you need to rub all the nooks & crannies with the soapy water. You should be cleaning out under your nails daily as well.", "You say your ABCs twice at a slow/normal rate. Friction plays a big part in killing germs. Make sure you get the backs, between the fingers and the finger tips, don't forget the thumb.", "Seriously, OP, how did you get through the pandemic without learning about the importance of and technique for proper hand washing?", "Here\u2019s a song for you to sing while you wash your hands. Put the soap on, sing while you scrub, and **then** put your hands in the water. \n\nTune is Row Row Row Your Boat\n\nScrub, scrub, scrub your hands \nGet them really clean\nScrub the tops and scrub the bottoms\nScrub them in between.\n\nWe just do it once at preschool, but I feel like maybe you should do it twice?", "He also said he washes his hands by putting soap between the palms and aggressively rubbing for 5-10 seconds then rinsing it off. This is not a clean person.", "I have also heard that name. As you say, not a great name for an undershirt.", "That shirt you're talking about,  I'm the ex wife.", "I just call it a tank top like all the rest of my sleeveless shirts and call it a day! Even the fancy sleeveless shirts with collars are just \u201cfancy tank tops.\u201d", "If you don't want to use that term, you can call it an A-frame tank.", "Most people I know would just call it a muscle tank.", "I think what we call it is pretty funny, because it\u2019s so true!", "Yes, it's very bad. Also seem to remember that name being associated with Marlon Brando's garment in the movie version of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". With Vivian Leigh...", "OMG I just Googled that and... That is a substantial difference of clothing style, although I can see how they have some similar features! \ud83e\udd23", "I work an outdoor, labour intensive job and this past summer I had one coworker who just *reeked* of sweat. Like, it wasn't a hygiene problem: he was fine in the car in the morning. But after about an hour I couldn't stand downwind from him.", "Let's not pretend half the human species naturally has toxic, corrosive sweat. Plenty of dudes keep themselves and their clothing clean. OP is not one of them.", "PULL BACK AND SCRUB", "We were at a Walmart(not anywhere near where we live, this one was in America) and while I did feel bad, there a woman, obviously down on her luck, wearing many layers of clothing so I assumed homeless. She was sitting on the bench outside the washroom and the smell of urine was overpowering. \n\nAn employee did come speak to her, but man. That was by far the worst thing I\u2019ve ever encountered at a Walmart.", "Dude. People can wear thongs and not have poop stains on them\u2026and that\u2019s normal. How is this guy getting skid marks in his underwear?? I\u2019m so thoroughly disgusted and I\u2019m just floored he thinks that it\u2019s okay. Just ew.", "Lemme add watch surgeons wash their hands as well.", "Glad to hear you're an ex.", "I also choose this shirt's ex wife", "Sleeveless shirt or sleeveless undershirt also works.", "Okay but I low-key just thought it was some weird Kiwi trend that some men wore those under their clothing.\n\nFor two years I lived there \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "Where did I ever pretend that?\n\nMost people can wipe their butts right. OP can't. Personal problem.", "It said \u201cman\u2019s\u201d sweat, not \u201cmen\u2019s\u201d. I think they meant this particular man, as in their dad\u2019s, sweat was toxic, it wasn\u2019t because he was bad with hygiene.", "We have a jumble of laundry in a shared basket and I sort them into his n\u2019 hers piles. I wouldn\u2019t have an issue doing my husband\u2019s laundry along with my own and the kids\u2019 but he\u2019s a decent guy who thinks I have enough to do as a SAHM without adding his chores in too.", "it\u2019s a shower not water boarding bro. she shouldn\u2019t have to force you", "She has infinite patience. Like, wow. That embarrassment should be channeled into new habits instead of defensiveness.", "Because your hygiene is *disgusting*", "\ud83d\ude02 I mean, you're not necessarily incorrect. Perhaps more research is required.", "I think they thought you said \u201cmen\u2019s sweat is toxic\u201d as in all men, rather than \u201cman\u2019s sweat is toxic\u201d, as in your dad.", "Ahhh good catch, I think you're right. Thanks!", "I see pinworms in their future", "And past\u2026 and present\u2026 I just see pinworms.", "Right?! How is she still able to have sex with him at all when she has to manually scrub the shit out of his ass beforehand??? WOMAN WHAT WHY HOW?!", "Lmao, they at least lick themselves clean"]}
