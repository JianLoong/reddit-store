My friend notified an employee who was not thrilled.\n\nAnother story... I worked at a grocery store in high school as a bagger. One of my jobs was to check bathrooms. One night, there was a massive poop explosion in the women's restroom. I had to clean it. To this day, almost 30 years later, I hate the song \"Sonny came home,\" because that was playing on the store music, and it is associated in my brain with that experience. \n\nLastly, more recently,  my husband was in Target. Somebody was dropping logs throughout the store. Employees were trying to close off areas where the poop was.", "I think he had so little time in the military he got used to taking a shit when he was about to shower so he never had to wipe to save time.

Get some real life experience living on your own and taking full care of yourself, go to some therapy, and then maybe consider being in a relationship where you don't need to seek a second mommy.

How the fuck does a grown ass man fail at this?
