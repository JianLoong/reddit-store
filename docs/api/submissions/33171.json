Am I the mistress between him and his daughter?", "selftext": "I am a 32 year old female who has a background in child development and social work. My boyfriend is 32 and his daughter is 8. We have been together for a year. There have been some issues surrounding how he is with his daughter which i will talk about in another post. I want to be clear, that it's not issues with their relationship as a whole, because the only reason why I am dating a man with a child is because he isn't a deadbeat and is very involved in his child's life.  \n\n But I keep having a problem with the fact that he continues to choose to sleep with her when she comes over to spend the night. \n\nThe issue was raised when we were getting ready to move in together.  I'm talking to daughter that she will have her own room to sleep in, and she makes it a point to say \"Oh no I don't sleep by myself. I have to have someone sleep with me.\" I then said, \"Well you're 8 years old, and should be sleeping by yourself by now. You're dad and I are moving in together so he's going to be sleeping in our bed with me.\" \n\nShe continued to argue with me, so later I brought it up to him and he got upset that i said that to her. He BLEW up and said that nothing was going to change because she is \"insecure\" about sleeping by herself; that when she was younger, they tried to get her to sleep in her room but would wake up throughout the night due to feeling that they aren't there with her and she'd wake them up crying. So it was \"easier\" just to let her sleep with them.  \n\nI had a problem with this for multiple reasons: 1. because moving in together is a big step and basically he is choosing to sleep with his daughter instead when she's old enough to sleep by herself, 2. he didn't even think that it would be a problem like it was expected I was to accept it and i should've know this already, 3. no initiation on his part to explain to her what us moving in together meant. so I did my best to not let it get to me. \n\nWell it got worse  because when she would spend the night in the 2nd bedroom and he'd put her to bed. He'd come to our bedroom, climb into bed with me, have sex with me and then clean up and go back to sleep in the bed with her. He wouldn't even tell me goodnight! No kiss on the cheek, no high five NOTHING! It was like he literally was \"sneaking\" out of her bed to get into mine, f\\*\\*\\* me and then \"sneak\" back into hers. I told him this in which you could see the shamefulness on his face and said he didn't realize that's what he was doing. \n\nHe still didn't tell her about sleeping by herself, but he would put her to bed and then \"sneak\" out but to sleep in our bed for the rest of the night. This was fine for a month but then one night she woke up at 3am, saw he was in my bed, and then called mom crying. I tried to explain that he needs to be consistent with this but he was panicking. I agreed to give him and her a little bit more time to get to use to her sleeping by herself, but nothing has changed for 5mths.\n\nI'm getting madder as the months roll by. AITA?

I know a couple who let their daughter sleep in the bed with them EVERY NIGHT until she was thirteen.  THIRTEEN!  I have to imagine at some point that is scarring for the kid.  Mom and dad, or whoever the pairing is, need to get it on, and need to have that closeness/intimacy together undisturbed.  The child also needs to learn independence.

(still kinda new to this sub). anyways,  I get why it's a problem for you,  I don't support the way you handled it with the kiddo but understand it.  now,  I got divorced when my youngest was almost 3. she was in the process of transition from crib to bed,  I was in the process of grieving the marriage and my big suddenly empty bed.  I started letting her sleep with me.  she's 9 and still to this day,  she sleeps with me most nights.  my situation is a little different bc my little one is special needs and we need the physical closeness more than most, my older boy also slept with me for a time after the divorce but that ended when he was about 6, he just naturally began to gravitate to his own room.  I understand your upset and why,  it's totally justifiable and valid to have an ongoing conversation with your man about it.  maybe try to set up a goal/ plan/ timeline. he absolutely should see the issue and try to work it out with you.  that being said,  understand that if your in this for the long haul,  you need to pick your battles.  his kiddo needing a physical connection to him to fall asleep is understandable, she's young and her parents aren't together.  let them have this.  it will not last forever.  you will be sleeping next to him for many years after she has outgrown this.  with your education and background, surely you can see the benefit she (and he) get from this thing they share.  I think you need to continue to communicate about the issue but if you present it with anger or like an ultimatum,  it could be detrimental to your relationship,  and the one you need to build with his daughter,  if indeed you are in this for the long haul.", "How can you have so little compassion for a child that you would try to take away her comfort in sleep and rest, when you\u2019re the grown adult who can sleep on their own?", "YTA. The parents get to decide about their child's sleeping arrangements. You don't correct her or tell her that you are going to change things. You don't have that power.

Should have waited to discuss a new sleeping situation together w/ her.\n  The big issue is that he has an emotional dependency on her. Sleeping in the same bed until she falls asleep is fine. Comforting her & giving her a set amount of time after waking up scared before he goes back to his space is cool. Occasional kid & parent camped under a pillow fort is cool. Not willing to help her learn to regulate her emotions & fears around sleep isn't fine. \n  He's putting his emotions (guilt, general discomfort) over her well-being. Kids have to learn to self soothe & put their feelings & beliefs in perspective. Parents have the responsibility to help their kids learn and manage that. He isn't willing to regulate his own feelings in the first place to be able to give her help with her own. He's putting off his own emotional management by blaming it on her feeling scared. She's scared-Now I'm uncomfy- I'll pacify her so I can stop feeling uncomfy.- Next day she is still scared & he's still uncomfy She's now getting the brunt of his feelings by not being helped to cope in the long term. That means he isn't being her parent in their relationship. \n  Even without the sleep issue, he didn't take the time or effort to explain that a new person in the home means life changes, just like when he & mommy started living in different houses. He needs therapy to work on his own emotional management & to figure out how to adult more. \n He doesn't seem like an ill intentioned dude. Thing is there's of plenty involved single dads that don't put their feelings before their kid's well-being or avoid explaining changes to them.\nI'm not telling you anything you don't know.
