My mom is the absolute pickle goddess. She makes the absolute best pickles you could possibly taste. She is very particular about what she buys, sorts them by hand, washed them individually, etc. There's a lot of work going into them, takes her basically the entire month of October. My dad likes to be praised and lives vicarously through my mom's pickle goddess success, so he gives away a lot of her work, much to mom's annoyance. \n\nThe friends in question are very well off but think they are entitled to free stuff. Mom's pickles are especially an object in demand througout the autumn, winter and spring to the point where almost half of what she makes ends up with them. \n\nMom is in her 70s. She had spinal surgery in August, she is under strict interdiction from standing or sitting in a chair for too long. Also cannot really bend over and most definetly cannot carry heavy stuff. Too much effort could comprimise her spinal cord and even leave her paralised. She normally buys and carries all the goods for the pickles herself with little help from my dad(her choice, dad is happy to help). Due to this, this year she only made a very small batch to use for her own household needs. \n\nMe and dad were visiting said friends. During the visit the lady gave dad a list of stuff she wants for the winter holidays. She was aware my mom had surgery. Dad said he will ask mom to make it. I took the list, hand it back to her and said \"sorry, there will be no pickels.  Mom is not well, she will not spend hours dragging stuff from the market and up the stairs, then work hours to prepare them\". I suggested she go to the market and buy, I am sure she can afford them. They even give out sample to taste before buying. Once again she insisted, I said no.\n\nThe husband said he is sure if he called my mom she will say yes. I said for sure she will not say yes. Dad was trying to intervene and I just cut him off saying \"we are leaving now.\" and just went out the door.\n\nWhile in the car to go home dad blew a gasket. This is when I literally lost it and started screaming like a banshee. I asked him why did I had to be the one telling them no why is his ego so important that he would put his wife's health at risk over not even being thanked properly. He called me an asshole and said he will not speak with me until I appologised to his friends.\n\nMom said I could have been more polite with dad's friends and she could have handled it herself. This is where I may be TA because my secret fear is that if something bad happens I will become the de-facto carer for her, which will be very difficult as I have 2 small kids (4mo and 2yo).\n\nThing is this: I also had major surgery which may have altered my brain chemestry because my social filters are pretty much gone. In case my social situation awareness is also gone along with my social filters, I am asking other people to weigh in.

I say ESH (kinda loosely) and here's why:   \n\n\nI think it's absolutely sweet and admirable that you are worried about your mom's well-being and you stuck up for her health.

Also, they're not entitled to anything.   \n\n\nBuuut, where I lean toward my judgement label is: I agree with your mom; you could have been more polite. You cut your dad off and contradicted what he said in front of his friends. And even dictated when you guys were gonna leave. And she's right that she could have handled it herself. she's an adult and she should be the one deciding whether she is willing and able to make their demands or not. It's not up to you to carry everyone's burdens on your shoulders. You have a full plate as it is.   \n\n\nBut like I said, my judgement is a loose-fitting one. I think your heart was in the right place and I know it can be frustrating to see our loved ones being taken advantage of, and wanting to protect them. It's a noble thing!

NTA. We get amazing salsa from a friend that my partner devours. It is her choice to make it and gift it to us.  Your dad and her friends have a lot of damn nerve. Draw the line for your mom's sake.

He does help if possible though.", "The problem is that mom can be a bit of a pushover when it comes to my dad asking for stuff, I am pretty sure she would have caved if being asked directly, even if that meant compromising her health. Things people do for love, heh?   \n\n\nIn fact I know for sure she would have because we had a similar situation about 10 years ago, when we were vacationing with the same set of people (same couple and 2 more) and while she was sick she ended up cooking whole meals and cleaning the house we were renting with these people. She was upset, but still did it, while the rest just lounged around without lifting as much as a straw.   \n\n\nI also know she is very annoyed at being demanded to provide for these people and especially because they don't contribute in any way and my parents do live pension cheque to pension cheque, while these people are loaded. The damn things are expensive not just labour intensive, especially with the prices the way they are.   \n\n\nI probably reacted more itensley because of that memory and seeing my mom being treated as kind of a servant by the same people and her not saying \"go love yourselves, I am also on vacation\". BTW, we were paying the same share of the rental as them (I know because I paid for me&hubby and my parents), so it was not a case of being grateful.

He was wrong to give away your mother\u2019s products and accept the praise for her hard work. He was terribly wrong to entertain the notion that she would continue to churn out pickles for his friends after such a serious medical issue. You were right to intercede and shut down your father\u2019s friend\u2019s rude and entitled demands. I assure you, your conduct was vastly more \u201cpolite\u201d than mine would have been.
