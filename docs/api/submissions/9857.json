That's why they go after me, not her.\n\nFed up, I told her I don't think men don't want to date you because of your weight. I think it's because you have a shitty, immature personality. You're jealous of every girl to the point where you try to put them down and bring them down to your level to make yourself feel better.\n\nShe was very upset with my words and called me jealous of her because she's mainly friends with men and this is why she isn't friends with women; they cause too much drama. She told other people what I said to her who said I crossed the line by saying that.\n\nI might be TA because she is mostly friends with men who describe her as very nice, but none of them were ever interested in dating her.

We both had friends and many guy friends.   \nFor me, that was because I enjoyed hunting, fishing, playing ball hockey, play paintball. She was (still is) overweight. She gets guy friends by showering them with flirtatious attention. Many of her friends she has had sex with. I don't ever cross the friend/lover lines or mix my relationships.  She would love to put down other women to make her look and feel good but never did anything to increase her self-esteem and confidence on a more permanent basis. She lost 2 great guys and blamed them, not the fact that cheating on them caused the relationships to fail. I also struggled to end my friendship with her as many described her as nice and friendly, which by all accounts, she was. But I noticed that her worth was based on male attention. I base mine on my education. Even when I attended university, she would laugh saying I would fail and would have to choose another career. (I got 2 degrees and I'm doing my master's)  She would also say, anytime a guy would talk to me that he would only be interested in nailing me. I realize now that another reason why we were friends was because I was thinner and would get more people talking to me, which meant more males in our circle, where she would have access. Yes, I was being used for exposure. Unfortunately, women who have low self-esteem and low self-confidence will never get confidence or self-esteem while in a relationship so being single should have been the time for her to work on loving herself.

However, my friend had a couple of sexual liaisons with the groom before he met his wife-to-be. She showed up unannounced/uninvited to her bridal shower and gave her the lingerie she wore when she was having sex with the groom. In a note, she basically said, \"Wear this. Tried, tested, and true. It makes him hot!\" Holy acting out! The friendship ended when I was prescribed marijuana for my bad back which she had issues with. I was not able to walk for a year, due to an injury but my prescription allowed me to walk again. Yes, prescription!  I'm actually playing sports now as a result. She wanted me to quit because she had issues with marijuana. (She had no issues with us going to clubs in Toronto during our 20s and drinking booze all night long).

It\u2019s about dehumanization.", "> Men don\u2019t ask for breast size as a prerequisite to date them like women do.\n\nOh you have no fucking idea, every woman in the fucking world would laugh at you claiming that.  There are absolutely positively guys who do that. \n\n> If you read my links you would know this isn\u2019t about dating. It\u2019s about dehumanization.\n\nIt's about you being full of shit and grasping at straws to act like a minor problem is a huge problem.\n\ngo get therapy, it will help you.", "But I am telling you, genuinely, that even with the best therapy in the world other people still view and treat me as inferior.", "NTA, its her personality. \n\nI'll be honest though, its also her weight. I'd rather have a woman that takes care of herself. I do too for the most part, why shouldn't I be picky? \n\nWorking out daily isn't a bad thing either, it shows you care about yourself and how you look. Its an investment in yourself. When you are proud of yourself, it shows in self confidence.", "NTA", "Nta. Listen op, I\u2019m a recovering \u201cpick me\u201d girl and was deeply fat phobic whilst simultaneously hating/being jealous of skinny women. Am I proud of this? No, I\u2019m not. I was incredibly unhappy with myself and thought my weight made me disgusting. I hated skinny women because \u201cthey had it so much easier\u201d than I did and I hated fat women because they dared to feel beautiful in bodies bigger than mine and I could barely look at myself. This all stems from an ed my grandmother helped cause. Does this make it ok? No. I will spend a very long time feeling remorse for my previous thoughts and prejudices. \n\nBut I worked on myself. I apologized to those I wronged. I quit blaming other people. I quit looking outward and started looking inward. Your friend obviously is not there yet. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad just because you called her out for body shaming others. She doesn\u2019t deserve to feel superior if it takes putting down other women to get there. Trust me, I know. It takes a lot of work to be able to look at yourself and admit that you\u2019re the problem. Not your weight or your looks or whatever superficiality you choose. You are the problem. I was the problem. Your friend is the problem. \n\nI don\u2019t really have any great advice for you. No rose bush epiphanies. The best thing I can tell you is to stop worrying about her and pacifying her. Eventually she will find herself all alone and wonder why no one will be her friend and maybe, just maybe, it\u2019ll finally dawn on her. She can work on herself and stop making excuses. Maybe she\u2019s happy with the way she looks and that\u2019s great, but the fact that she tears you and others down so frequently makes me think that she isn\u2019t. If you continue to pick up the pieces, and swallow and push down your anger, not only are you doing her a disservice but you\u2019re doing yourself a disservice as well. You deserve to be around people that build you up and think you deserve good things. Friends that don\u2019t chalk your successes up to your weight and attractiveness. You deserve more in a friend and she\u2019s not up to the challenge right now. \n\nBest of luck op.", "You hit the nail on the head with this woman. And I'd like to add something that you probably never thought of because you have compassion for her weight issues. She would be the same person if she was a size 6. She is jealous, mean and not your friend. NTA.", ">Fed up, I told her I don't think men don't want to date you because of your weight. I think it's because you have a shitty, immature personality. \n\nESH. Yes, she sucks for being a jealous mean girl. But let\u2019s be realistic here. How many men are looking past her weight to actually find out what her personality is like? It is objectively much harder to date for someone who is obese.", "Done", "NTA.", "When two people hate each other\u2019s personality, they shouldn\u2019t be friends. Esh", "As one of the women like that, not always the case lol. But most of my male friends are my gaming buddies.", "I have mostly male friends simply because of shared hobbies and interests.\n\nI have female friends too though and none of us are crazy, and calling women with mostly male friends crazy is pretty sexist. \n\nBlanket statements always make someone an AH.", "My husband is 5'4\" and I'm 5'6\". He doesn't care that he's short. He's able to joke about it and have fun with it. He's very confident with how he is, and I love him just the way he is. When I was younger I always imagined myself with someone real tall. But with my husband, I can't imagine being with anyone else than him. His height is just perfect to me", "50% of the adult US population is actually obese based on BMI. Again, statistics don't bear out your opinion. \nYou're not attracted to obese people and that's cool. I find white men, especially blond men, unattractive. But, that doesn't mean white men are unattractive, it's an opinion. Maybe, men aren't attracted to her because she's obese, most likely it's a crappy personality."]}
