She spread around how her other friend stole her crush and lied about the facts to make her friend seem worse.\n\nNatalie hates other women for having a lot of men pursue them or having boyfriends. She said her former friends have ditched her once they got boyfriends. She hates when women wear skirts or shorts because she thinks they are showing off their body.\n\nWhenever I mention going to the gym when she asks what my plans are, she tells me that I am obsessed. I go 3 times a week and she knows this. She has tried to convince me not to go to the gym, telling me that she's  in me for wanting to go.\n\nWhen guys ask me out, she tells me that they are only interested in my \"hot body\".\n\nHer weight has been increasing over the years and she has went from overweight to obese. I have comforted her and tried helping her (when she wanted my help) but she won't change her diet nor exercise. She calls counting calories to lose weight excessive.\n\nInstead, she said what she always said: men aren't interested in her romantically because of her weight and all they care about is looks, not personality. That's why they go after me, not her.\n\nFed up, I told her I don't think men don't want to date you because of your weight. I think it's because you have a shitty, immature personality. You're jealous of every girl to the point where you try to put them down and bring them down to your level to make yourself feel better.\n\nShe was very upset with my words and called me jealous of her because she's mainly friends with men and this is why she isn't friends with women; they cause too much drama. She told other people what I said to her who said I crossed the line by saying that.\n\nI might be TA because she is mostly friends with men who describe her as very nice, but none of them were ever interested in dating her.

You know, maybe you could have expressed this more diplomatically, but I think that you\u2019ve reached a point where you are just sick of her bullshit.  She has issues, that much is clear.  It\u2019s not her weight.  My daughter struggles with her weight because of her medications, but she had no problem finding her husband.  She has a lovely full round face, as some bigger ladies do, and looks amazing with her killer eyeliner.  Her husband loves her as she is, and wouldn\u2019t change anything.  I know I\u2019m biased but she\u2019s not the only one.\n\nYour friend has a problem, and because she has a problem, it is everyone\u2019s problem.  You are right, people pick up on it.  It\u2019s not her weight that puts men off, it\u2019s her approach to her weight.  She has an unhealthy fixation on her self image and constantly compares herself to other women, becoming bitter and concluding incorrectly that her lack of romantic success is due to this factor alone.  \n\nRather than making the best of herself in the body she\u2019s in, she grouches and moans that it\u2019s not fair that she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend.  She could diet and exercise if she wanted to, but she doesn\u2019t, and that\u2019s her choice.  Despite this choice she also tries to sabotage others.  I personally think that she is expressing classic misogyny - that the women around her who do get boyfriends only get them by flaunting themselves, ie. \u201cslut shaming\u201d.  \n\nIf you remain friends after this is up to you and her, but she does seem pretty toxic.  Toxic rather than immature.   NTA", "Oh this reminds me of my kid's godmother. I swear, you described her exactly. She was my friend since school, maybe 15 years old. We both had friends and many guy friends.   \nFor me, that was because I enjoyed hunting, fishing, playing ball hockey, play paintball. She was (still is) overweight. She gets guy friends by showering them with flirtatious attention. Many of her friends she has had sex with. I don't ever cross the friend/lover lines or mix my relationships.  She would love to put down other women to make her look and feel good but never did anything to increase her self-esteem and confidence on a more permanent basis. She lost 2 great guys and blamed them, not the fact that cheating on them caused the relationships to fail. I also struggled to end my friendship with her as many described her as nice and friendly, which by all accounts, she was. But I noticed that her worth was based on male attention. I base mine on my education. Even when I attended university, she would laugh saying I would fail and would have to choose another career. (I got 2 degrees and I'm doing my master's)  She would also say, anytime a guy would talk to me that he would only be interested in nailing me. I realize now that another reason why we were friends was because I was thinner and would get more people talking to me, which meant more males in our circle, where she would have access. Yes, I was being used for exposure. Unfortunately, women who have low self-esteem and low self-confidence will never get confidence or self-esteem while in a relationship so being single should have been the time for her to work on loving herself. Instead, she acts out. The last straw is when a friend of ours was getting married. I knew the bride and groom before they met each other. However, my friend had a couple of sexual liaisons with the groom before he met his wife-to-be. She showed up unannounced/uninvited to her bridal shower and gave her the lingerie she wore when she was having sex with the groom. In a note, she basically said, \"Wear this. Tried, tested, and true. It makes him hot!\" Holy acting out! The friendship ended when I was prescribed marijuana for my bad back which she had issues with. I was not able to walk for a year, due to an injury but my prescription allowed me to walk again. Yes, prescription!  I'm actually playing sports now as a result. She wanted me to quit because she had issues with marijuana. (She had no issues with us going to clubs in Toronto during our 20s and drinking booze all night long).  We are now 50 years old, and she is living at home with mom and dad. I'm engaged and she still has no boyfriend.  You are not the AH but I highly suggest removing this person as your friend.", "I'm going to go a little further and suggest that your friend seems to be at war - with herself. She is putting men on a pedestal as a prize yet isn't putting in the work she herself thinks is needed to get one for a boyfriend. In fact she's making herself even more unattractive according to her reasoning.", "That's something that can be true when you're all teenagers, but adults? Nah.", "My husband is 5'4 and never had any issues dating before we met so it's never a height thing. I'm 5'2 so we work perfectly. I had a friend who was 6' and complained about getting guys because some men couldn't handle her being taller, not that she wanted a taller boyfriend.", "Yep, and I'm sick of people trying to act like everything exists in a vacuum as if how you interact with the world is not reflective of your personality.\n\nI'll probably be downvoted but not taking care of your body reflects on your personality. This holds for both men and women. How you dress, whether you take pride in your appearance, also reflects on your personality. That doesn't mean they should be condemned: many have had shitty childhoods or mental health struggles. However, it's still reflective of their personality and where they're at.", "doesn't surprise me!", "So, SAYING misogynistic things is misogynistic. Absolutely. Existing while enjoying non-feminine coded activities is not misogynistic. Saying that you enjoy traditionally masculine activities is not misogynistic. \n\nIf every woman is interchangeable with every other woman, we're back to being incubators who also cook. \n\nThis is probably a bad place for this convo, because I agree that the woman in OPs post is in the wrong and also a misogynistic asshole, but I spotted NLOG in your comment and there I went, lol. Like I said, it just keeps coming up and I can't stop thinking how this thought process is indicative of our larger obsession with purity culture. I feel like the last two generations did everything they could to eliminate barriers, boxes and labels, and now the newest couple generations are running around shoving everyone into boxes and slapping labels on everything in sight.", "May want to consider dropping them too if they\u2019re so blind to her ways.", "ops friend outright says she doesnt hang out with women because they cause drama. i dont see how your comment applies here.", "This girl is not just enjoying traditionally masculine things and that\u2019s not what NLOG is. If you like activities that are not considered feminine, cool nobody cares. It\u2019s when you start treating other women as less than for being traditionally feminine that you become NLOG. It can be misused, but the term itself is not implying that all women have the same interests"]}
