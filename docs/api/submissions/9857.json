I think she has a strong victim complex as a result of her jealousy.\n\nOne of the things Natalie has done is she tried to ruin her other friend's new relationship because she had a crush on the guy 5 years ago. She spread around how her other friend stole her crush and lied about the facts to make her friend seem worse.\n\nNatalie hates other women for having a lot of men pursue them or having boyfriends. She said her former friends have ditched her once they got boyfriends. She hates when women wear skirts or shorts because she thinks they are showing off their body.\n\nWhenever I mention going to the gym when she asks what my plans are, she tells me that I am obsessed. I go 3 times a week and she knows this. She has tried to convince me not to go to the gym, telling me that she's  in me for wanting to go.\n\nWhen guys ask me out, she tells me that they are only interested in my \"hot body\".\n\nHer weight has been increasing over the years and she has went from overweight to obese. I have comforted her and tried helping her (when she wanted my help) but she won't change her diet nor exercise. She calls counting calories to lose weight excessive.\n\nInstead, she said what she always said: men aren't interested in her romantically because of her weight and all they care about is looks, not personality. That's why they go after me, not her.\n\nFed up, I told her I don't think men don't want to date you because of your weight. I think it's because you have a shitty, immature personality. You're jealous of every girl to the point where you try to put them down and bring them down to your level to make yourself feel better.\n\nShe was very upset with my words and called me jealous of her because she's mainly friends with men and this is why she isn't friends with women; they cause too much drama. She told other people what I said to her who said I crossed the line by saying that.\n\nI might be TA because she is mostly friends with men who describe her as very nice, but none of them were ever interested in dating her. I've seen her treat her male friends differently, almost like she has a crush on all of them. But they have seen what she says and does to her female friends and just say \"they weren't meant to be friends\".\n\nI was wondering AITA?  \n\n\nEdit: there are times when she is nice. I think when she gets jealous, she acts out.
