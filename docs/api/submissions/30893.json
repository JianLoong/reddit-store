People who wait until they're at the front of the line to start thinking about what they want are the worst. Plan your order while you're waiting or before you even get in line or everyone's time gets wasted. But that's just me venting; you're never wrong to be polite to service folks and thank them for being patient with you. Her sensitivity is her own problem.", "NTA. What an odd thing to be upset about. \u201cYou implied I took too long\u201d well\u2026she kind of did? Lol", "ESH. She needed to get her stuff together because it's absolutely obnoxious to do that in a drive-through. \n\nHowever, it's crystal clear that you were annoyed by her behavior with the way you phrased her part of the conversation. Of course, it's fine to thank a server for being patient, but it seems to me like you only did it because you wanted to passively aggressively remind your wife that she was being obnoxious. Obviously, she felt the same way, or she wouldn't have said anything. So you are also TA for being petty.", "Nta.\n\nYou partner can feel embarrassed or not, it's all internal and out of your control.\n\nBy the way, good for you for not continuing to enable her to give you shit for her order. She's an adult, she can order her own.", "YTA. \n\nConsidering that menu boards are usually right at the speaker, yeah, sometimes it can take a few moments to decide what I'm feeling. And, if I'd briefly contemplated (what you said she said only sounds brief) at the window, and then my partner had made some passive aggressive comment hidden as a politeness, I'd have been pissed off too. Just say thank you and move on. You're getting ice cream, cheer up.\n\nPlus, her order wasn't even long and complicated.", "YTA, it doesn\u2019t sound like she took long enough to warrant that comment\n\nAlso as a service person, I\u2019m paid by the hour. I don\u2019t give a shit how long you take to order, as long as you\u2019re nice.", "YTA but you get bonus points for managing a back-handed insult while thanking someone. All very deniable.\n\nBut yes, of course you were insulting your wife! If you just wanted to thank the server, you would have just said thank you, not \"for being patient.\" Can't gaslight us on that.\n\nEDIT: And fwiw, many of us would also be annoyed about your wife not having decided. But your AITA question isn't about whether you were right to be annoyed, it was about your reaction to it.", "YTA. Condescending and unwarranted. \nYou initially gave the premise of reasoning that your wife has \u2018extremely long orders you always mess up\u2019. When actually her order was also four uncustomized words with maybe ten extras for seemingly quick contemplation. \n\nIf you consider \u201can oreo blizzard, please\u201d a complicated order, which took about 7 seconds in total to politely say, then id say you have bigger issues.\n\nfull stop.", "YTA\n\nYou were clearing insulting you wife through a backhanded compliment. You pretty much said: **I\u2019m sorry my wife took so long to order** which, of course, is insulting. And deliberate. And your wife saw right through your crap.\n\nWhile it\u2019s nice to always have your order immediately ready, I often get to the menu of a drive thru and need a minute to figure out what I want from a list of 40 things. Especially if it\u2019s one I don\u2019t frequent very often. This sounded like it was a 30 second delay - max - absolutely not a big deal.", "NTA.  It is polite to say that to the worker, and there was no good reason for your wife to take offense.", "YTA", "YTA it's not that big a deal, it's not like the employee cares if they get the order fast", "I've read how certain drive thrus need you to order asap.   I went a certain place for the first time ever a while ago and they didn't have what the google shop menu said these stores did have. So I had to look at the board.  I swear I could feel  her impatience coming through the speaker.  Sorry hun but I can't eat chilli so I have to actually look at which things dont have that. Maybe put another menu board further away or make sure your google sites are correct. \nI ended up leaving with an apology.", "Nta and your wife needs to get her shit together, you decide BEFORE the window.", "ESH - she was annoying, and you were passive aggressive.", "Next time, don't pull up to place your order until she can tell you EXACTLY what she wants, and if it's excessively complicated, she can go inside and order her own.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were being polite. There was nothing rude about what you said in regard to your wife.", "NTA, I have a feeling that she felt like she was taking too long and was projecting her feelings onto you", "she's telling on herself lmao\n\nNTA", "I can't make a judgment here because there is no way to know the tone of how you said those words and that would be the deciding factor here.", "NTA. You thanked the worker for being patient with your indecisive wife. Your wife is indecisive. If she doesn't like being indecisive then she can decide to be decisive. Oh the irony.", "NTA. She was being ridiculous", "NTA. She should figure out her order ahead of time.", "NTA.  Your wife is an asshole for getting to the window without knowing what she wants and thereby holding up the entire line.", "NTA. Wife sounds unsufferable.", "> I unintentionally insulted my wife\n\nIt\u2019s honestly hard to believe you didn\u2019t mean it as a slight \ud83d\ude05 That being said, it was completely the appropriate thing to do. Calling out someone who is being an asshole is not asshole behaviour. Your wife was being an asshole by not deciding what she wanted before getting to ordering. \n\nPretty low level on the asshole scale, but an asshole move nonetheless. \n\nNTA.", "It was passive aggressive (and funny), but NTA. The worker deserved the thanks! Agree with other comments, even if you don\u2019t know what you want the worker doesn\u2019t need to hear the thought process.", "NTA\n\nShe's one of those that will wait until she's on top of the line to even realize what's there to eat, let alone what she's gonna eat. \n\nThat's a very disrespectful and, quite frankly, a very dumb behavior. Both for the workers and for the people behind that will have to wait because you realized you're about to get food when they asked you what you wanted to eat. \n\nImho, your wife sounds insufferable and like she's just waiting for a pretext to tell you you hurt her feelings.", "what a ridiculous conflict.

She wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted, the person taking the order would be very use to it and it took up all of a few seconds. In the scheme of things, it\u2019s no big deal.  Don\u2019t make her feel bad about being her.", "The menu is usually at the speaker box, if she's not familiar with the menu she may have needed a sec to figure things out. \n\nThat said, I agree that being polite to service workers is always a good idea.", "I hate that about the menu boards. Especially Taco Bell, which rotates their menu every 5 days.

None of the fast food where I am has menus before the speaker box. I'm someone who likes to not cause delays, but I can't pick from a menu that I can't see.", "I understand needing a bit because the menu is at the speakerbox. I hate when people decide they need to run their internal decision-making process *outloud*. The person on the other end doesn't need to hear your debate between an oreo or reeses blizzard. As a fellow passenger in the car, I don't want to hear it. Plus, the person at the drivethru is trying to figure out if you are actually ordering something through a crappy speaker. Once had a friend start musing and the person just put in everything they 'ordered'. \n\n\nPersonally, if I'm a passenger, I'm on my phone looking at the menu so I'm ready when we pull up.", "If this was her first time at DQ then yes.  More likely a she knows the menu.", "That is not a particularly complicated order...", "Lol, what? It is even in the fucking title that the question was about thanking the worker the way OP did.", "I always assumed they did this because it gave the workers a few extra minutes in-between cars to prepare the previous order and then customers just blame other customers for being slow."]}
