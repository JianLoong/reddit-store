You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA\nHe had no right to be there! He should take it up with security office but doubt he registered his car.", "NTA - You all signed the same legally binding lease agreement and they knew the rules but skirted them for the sake of their convenience. Most of the time people can get away with that, but once in a while it has consequences. Be grateful for the dirty looks because they've really communicated what type of people they are and now you know to steer clear!", "NTA: your neighbor was responsible for the situation & the complex was responsible for the tow, if the complex was in the wrong then he should get the apology from them", "NTA - Neighbor sounds like an majorly entitled asshole. If you park in someone else's space, you risk getting towed. It doesn't matter if no one was parked their at the time.", "Doesn't sound like he learned a lesson but we can only hope.\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nEntitlement gets a rude awakening to reality sometimes, a lesson your neighbor just learned.", "NTA. Your parking spaces. Not your problem it was towed. They need to take it up with apartment management.", "NTA. You had to save a life. He had to be a dick and block you in. You do the math.", "NTA. \n\nThey were blocking you in, and its not your fault they hadn't registered their vehicle. Neighbor can take it up with commi ity sexurity if they're so upset about it.  They're the ones that had it towed.", "NTA. Wtf were they doing on your driveway anyway? I would have had that car towed even if I did not have to get anywhere. Actually, I would have had that car towed even if I did not have a car of my own!", "The only thing that would have put you in the wrong is if you had personally towed the vehicle, but you didn't . You called the community centre, and then THEY called the tow truck on them. If you had taken the time to knock on every door, explaining your situation and asking if it was their car you would not have made it to work. And honestly if you park your car in an area you know you're not supposed to you should not be surprised if you get towed with zero courtesy.\n\nNTA, and honestly just meet the glares with nice sunny smiles and cheery hellos. Because you'd be both taking the high road and showing how unbothered you are by their dirty looks.", "100% NTA. If they keep giving you dirty looks, just smile and flip them off.", "NTA, the audacity of that person to basically say that they had the right to park there even after you explained is astonishing! Maybe they'll learn a lesson from this and park where they're supposed to in the future.", "NTA\n\n1. He never, ever had the right to park there. Just because he got away with it in the past, doesn't somehow turn into it being OK for him to park there.\n2. It's his job to make sure the apartment has his car on file. If he's going to risk parking his car illegally, he should probably have cared more to make sure the complex knew how to reach him. BTW, he probably never did take the trouble to register his car with the complex; he's just saying that because 'nothing is ever his fault'.\n3. He owes you for the $40 you spent. Make sure he knows that if you ever discuss this again. In the meantime, in response to his looks - look him in the eye with a firm and clear gaze (slightly superior, if you like).", "NTA - but your neighbour is one!", "NTA. You absolutely had to get to work. But that doesn\u2019t matter. They parked in a spot that they knew wasn\u2019t there\u2019s to park in. They live there, they know how the parking works. They caused their own misfortune. Don\u2019t park where you\u2019re not supposed to park. You decide to park where you can get towed then you void your right to get mad when it happens.", "NTA my husband would have lost his crap if that happened to him while he was on call. The AH neighbor should have also paid for your $40 uber!!", "NTA.  \n\nWhen they pay rent to the landlord that owns the garage and space in front of the garage, they can park there.  Until then, that space can be empty for years and they still have no right to use it.\n\nPeriod.", "NTA", "Nta they knew they weren\u2019t supposed to park there and you did your best.", "NTA\n\nYou had to pay money to get to work because they parked where they shouldn\u2019t have parked.\n\nIf they mention it again, let them know that\u2026", "NTA", "NTA not their spot.", "Yes, Y T A for not letting an entitled random person block you into your own driveway.\n\n/s you hear how it sounds though right lol NTA", "NTA\n\nHopefully, this will convince him not to park in front of your garage anymore. An expensive lesson, but it's not your job to move heaven and earth to find out who owns it.", "op=NTA\n\nThey should not be parking in spaces that is NOT theirs UNLESS they have permission first.\n\nPeople should die so their car doesn't get towed? I think not.", "No. NTA.  People street park in front of our gated driveway all the time.  It's ALWAYS the Airbnb 2 doors down.  I don't even knock on the door before having it towed anymore.  It happens literally once a month.", "NTA - that's what they get for blocking someone in", "NTA. They are entirely in the wrong and they damn well know it.", "NTA\n\nNeighbor should not have parked where they shouldn\u2019t be. They gambled and lost. There\u2019s also no reasonable way for you to know who\u2019s vehicle it is, nor should you be expected to act like some sort of amateur detective spending your time to save them money.\n\nAnd you also had to deal with a 40 dollar lyft bill because of their nonsense.\n\nSo I have no sympathy for them.", "NTA neighbor is luck it didn't cost *more* to get the car back, at all, unscathed.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t their parking space so they got what they deserved for blocking you in.", "Plus he owes you $40 for the Uber!", "I wonder if he was trying to dodge a fee for having more than two vehicles or something. About the only way his actions make any sense, even if it was still a massive dick move and he still has no right to be pissed.", "This.\n\n100% this.\n\nSorry I have only *one* upvote to give you.", "This ^^^", "More like he didn't want to deal with moving his 2nd car every time the 1sr car wanted out.", "NTA.   If they do it again, have them towed immediately.  Just in case you need to leave for an emergency", "Bill them for the Lyft and cc the management company.

Please make sure the office knows this for future issues.  Most of all you are not an AH.  This guy thinks it is ok to block a garage because he thought no one was using it, it was not his garage, it was not an open place to park.  If he says something again tell him you had to pay for a lift to get to work because he illegally parked and blocked you in,", "They parked where they shouldn\u2019t have, taking the risk (and blame) upon themselves.\n\nNTA", "Nta, my dad is a registered nurse and has had many cars towed when he was in call. You being even 5 mins late is life or death, how could you possibly thing you were are the Ah here.", "Also, it was midnight! Few people are going to react positively to someone knocking in the middle of the night to figure out who is blocking you in.\n\nIt's unreasonable to expect someone to hunt you down to move your car from their property in broad daylight (especially with no easy way to identify the owner). It's absolutely ludicrous to expect someone to do it at that hour.", "And they need to repay for the Lyft fee.", " \nThis will convince him to stop parking in front of your garage.", "Plus, OP and husband weren't the ones who had the car towed anyway. Security did!", "NTA. Illegally parked cars get towed. Thats on him for blocking you in. Not your responsibility", "Nta", "NTA\u2026now you know where to send the bill for the $40 lyft", "NTA - They parked in your spot in front of your garage. Your responsability level to finding the owner of the car is zero.", "Dude, I have been that neighbor. My car was towed. I was pissed, but still I knew it was my bad NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIf the neighbor could find the audacity, they could find an actual parking space.", "It's more likely that he expected them to just stay stuck there until he decided to move his vehicle in the morning.", "Holy cow the entitlement of some people. The neighbor parked a car he hasn't registered with the neighborhood in your driveway, you had to spend money on a ride to work, and YTA? I think not. NTA, at all.", "NTA", "NTA. Maybe you could ask him for his venmo or paypal, see his shocked Pikachu when he sees it's a request for the $40 for the Uber you needed when he illegally parked in your drive.", "NTA. \"I didn't see anyone parked here before so I didn't see a problem\" doesn't excuse the fact that they parked in front of your garage in the first place. Also how would you have been able to look for the owner if the car wasn't registered to someone of the community? They are mad at a problem they caused.", "That was my immediate thought.  Or not on the lease for wherever he's staying."]}
