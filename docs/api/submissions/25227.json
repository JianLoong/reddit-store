{"id": 25227, "submission_id": "15xwibh", "title": "AITA for demanding my sister-in-law pay my babysitter", "selftext": "\n\nSo this has been causing a bit of an issue in my family and very few are on my side including \u201cEve\u201d my babysitter/nanny who is the very person I\u2019m defending ( to be fair she just doesn\u2019t want to be the cause of fight).\n\nI recently found out that my sister-in-law for the past year and half has been dropping her two kids off for a few hours each week with Eve my nanny/babysitter, so that sister-in-law can either go grocery shopping, take a nap, gym or to the salon to get her hair/ nails done. Eve is a generous and kindhearted person who I know would have a difficult time saying no to a pushy person like my sister-in-law. Eve did say that she prefers that sil didn\u2019t but she doesn\u2019t want to cause trouble and didn\u2019t want me to do anything.\n\nSo over the weekend I had a chat with sil and I asked her to stop asking Eve to take care of her kids and that she needed to look into daycare or get her own nanny as Eve will no longer be doing free childcare for her. I even gave her the details of nanny/babysitter service that could match her with someone. \n\nSince then my in-laws have been on my ass pretty much. They\u2019re saying that I should \u201cshare\u201d Eve with sil and when I sarcastically asked if they\u2019d go half\u2019s with me and we\u2019d split Eve\u2019s 80k salary and suddenly it\u2019s sil could never afford that. I of course knew she couldn\u2019t pay even half her wages. So I asked her to then at least pay her 25 an hour every time she dumps her kids on her. This also was met with she can\u2019t afford it. \n\nSo I told her that if she can\u2019t afford it than she\u2019d need to watch her own kids. Apparently that was rude and I\u2019m using my money to bully them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole in this and in fact I think they are for thinking it\u2019s normal to have free childcare. My husband is also pissing me off, because he thinks I\u2019m being an asshole for saying anything and for even ask they pay. Now after having discussed this with my colleague I\u2019m starting to doubt it as she pointed out that Eve has been put into awkward situation since my sil did text her asking if she was okay with her having dropped her kids off with her. \n\nBut the thing is I know Eve I know she\u2019s just too shy to say no or she\u2019s possibly worried that this could maybe effect her job(not that it would and I have reassured Eve that her job is in no way or shape in jeopardy) \n\nSo am I being an asshole and should I let it go?\n\nEdit 1- I just want to make things clear and say my husband was aware of his sisters behavior which is how I was kept out of the loop.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried to put myself in Eve\u2019s shoes and from my understanding, Eve\u2019s unfortunately afraid of rocking the boat as she is in a vulnerable position. She has limited English and she\u2019s in the process of getting her citizenship which obviously makes her vulnerable for exploitation. And the fact that my husband was the main person who dealt with Eve also played a big part in sil using her for unpaid labor. \n\nAnd to also be fairer to Eve she has babysat for sil when I was aware of it but I always compensated her for it. \n\nSo all in all I absolutely understand how she would\u2019ve thought it was okay and I put all the blame on my own head and on husband\u2019s and sister-in-laws!\n\nEdit 2- As someone has pointed out- I have a husband problem not a in-law problem. As it is his fault for not stepping in when his sister was taking advantage and that his inaction and my own allowed for this to go on.\n\nThank you for pointing that out I\u2019ve made a note of that and will be talking to Eve about how this situation has been caused by not only my sister-in-law but also by me and my husband. I absolutely hold my hand up and say I should\u2019ve been more protective of her and should\u2019ve empowered her, and unfortunately I failed at that.\n\nI will be having a conversation with my husband and removing him as Eve\u2019s primary ( I pay Eve\u2019s salary and I am the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d and work crazy long hours and so relied on my husband to fill me in on the day to day information and so I will have to find a way to be home more often and deal with things myself)\n\nEdit 3- FYI Eve and I are from the same culture, ethnicity and race. Which is one of the biggest reasons I hired her as I wanted my children to know my native language and culture. \n\nAfter some conversation with a couple of redditors I am now seeing my husband and in-laws in less rose-tinted glasses. Although there hasn\u2019t been any racial slurs or micro aggressions thrown around. I would need to keep in mind that this probably wouldn\u2019t have happened to someone in the same racial identity as my white in-laws. \n\nThe entire thing now has grown into a different thing and I feel very stupid and I think this is a \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d situation!", "created_utc": 1692683757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xwibh/aita_for_demanding_my_sisterinlaw_pay_my/", "score": 2005, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not your sister in law. Ask Eve to block her number and never allow her to drop her children off again. Your sister in law ITA and needs to find her own sitter, even if she starts paying Eve because of how she fucked her over multiple times.", "NTA\n\nIf your SIL thought she was doing the right thing, she wouldn't have hidden it from you for a year and a half. It's not your job to pay for childcare for your niece(s)/nephew(s). \n\nYou are well within your rights to be pissed and don't give in.", "NTA. She is taking the piss! Definitely well within your right to ask for her to contribute", "I don\u2019t even know how to rule. Your SIL and her family all suck.\n\nBut honestly, I would be upset with Eve too. Being a nice person does not mean you allow yourself to be a doormat. *a year and a half?* like how did this all start? Does SIL have a key or did Eve let her in? How did she get Eve\u2019s number to ask her to begin with?\n\nWhat else does she allow because she\u2019s afraid of confrontation?", "NTA, you are paying Eve $80k for x number of kids, it\u2019s not fair for her to watch x+2 kids at the same rate. Similarly, it\u2019s not fair for you to pay any additional costs. SIL can watch her own kids if she can\u2019t afford childcare, your inlaws can help.", "NTA. When Eve was hired, I'm sure there was a discussion regarding the role and her responsibilities. Your SIL dropping her kids off, unannounced, was surely not part of that discussion and absolutely deviates from what she was told she could expect to do in her day. Eve needs to be compensated for any extra work she's doing. Your husband should also realize that this intrusion by his sister can cause Eve to leave and put the two of you in a bind.", "NTA. **You** hired the babysitter for **your** kids. Period. SIL can piss off unless she want to share the bill.", "NTA\n\nInform Eve that from now on, she is not to let anyone into your home.  Then let SIL  stand outside the door and knock and ring the doorbell until she can't anymore.  Make sure that Eve realizes that you are her employer, and that having SIL in your home is not acceptable when you are not there.  Eve is nice, but she needs to be firm in this, as you aren't at home to enforce your household's rules.  Following your rules is part of Eve's job.  Eve doesn't need to say anything when SIL comes to the door.  She just needs to keep the door locked and closed to SIL.  \n\nIf you know the date that SIL comes over, then you can make sure Eve isn't there that day.  If you can get off work, you could stay home that day and wait for SIL to show up.  \n\nThe fact that SIL was sneaky about it means that she knows she is freeloading.  Otherwise, she would have asked if it was okay before dropping the kids off.  \n\nWhile SIL may not be able to afford $25/hour, she can afford something.  But that isn't the point.  The point is that she did this without your permission, invaded your home without asking, and expected free work from your employee.  \n\nThere are plenty of parents who bring their kids everywhere - grocery shopping, hair appointments, doctor appointments, etc. - as they don't have a babysitter.  \n\nIf your family is so involved, then they should babysit SIL's kids.", "You hired Eve to care for your children. Sis-in-law (SIL) went behind your back to use your nanny for free childcare, somehow for six months before you found out. I'm not surprised Eve didn't mind, but surprised she didn't inform you as her employer!  How is she so cozy with SIL that she's ok having her kids around yours without asking you--at 80 grand a year! \n\n You're NTA for expecting SIL to contribute ~something~ for using a service you pay for.  And YWNBTA to find out why Eve felt she had to keep this on the QT for so long! Some vital piece of information is missing here", "How bout  sil drop the hair and nails and the gym and whatever else  and be a Mother.   Maybe that's why she can't afford it.   Or everyone bitching can pay your nanny. \n\n Seeing lots of overworked Nanny/babysitters on the nanny site here I'm surprised she  puts up with it.", "NTA, however this is also a little on Eve for not being firm with her business. I get its hard, but she needs to know the value of her labor. I think its great that you've stepped in to be a middle man, but Eve giving sis the formal permission to do this is also whats causing the problem. If sis is being told it's ok, she may think she's just getting helped out. \n\nAnd if you wanna help boost Eve up, since she mentioned \"not wanting to cause problems\", you can sit her down and just say something like \n\n\"You aren't gonna cause problems if you don't wanna watch my sister's kids for free. I'm your client here, I'm the one paying you, so I'm not gonna be mad if you only do what I'm paying you to do, which is watch MY kids. You can tell my sister no. And if she gets upset, just call me I'll deal with her. She's not your responsibility\"\n\nHell you can even tell your sister something like \"I don't want my house being used as a daycare so stop bringing them to us.\"", "NTA. You pay for Eve to watch and spend time with YOUR kid(s). While I'm sure Eve can handle two more kids for a few hours, it inevitably takes some of her attention away from those she is being paid to watch. \n\nI will allow that if SIL had asked in advance, and it was only on occasion, and Eve was okay with it,  then maybe it would have been right to help SIL out. But her going ahead and just doing this for 18 months? Hell no", "Eve is your employee.   You determine what kids she takes care of and when.  She really does not have a say in it.  \n\nIf you had a friend who worked as a secretary, you wouldn't walk into her employers business and hand her stuff you need typed when you don't even work there.  That's effectively what SIL is doing when she drops her kids off and expects your nanny to care for them.\n\nNTA", "Wow NTA.  The entitlement is outrageous. Can\u2019t afford it so should have it for free. I can\u2019t afford a Porsche but I want one so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine if I just rock up at the dealership and they\u2019ll give me one.  I feel sorry for Eve, this isn\u2019t even a money issue, this is just not abusing people.", "NTA, your sil is taking advantage of Eve's kindness. But, Eve should also put her foot down on her own, she really should block your sil's number or don't answer the door for her.", "NTA - SIL is clearly the primary asshole.\n\nI am also wondering if I am the asshole while reading this, my immediate reaction would be to fire Eve and hire a more competent nanny.", "Nta. You jired Eve to tale care of your children. When she drop jers Eve have less attention t give your children because of that. You want someone who have full attention on  your child. And she wasnt hired to take of all the children of the family only yours.", "NTA. Tell Eve that when your SIL stands in front of your door that she should tell her to pay her x amount of money in cash before she can drop off the kids. If she can't or doesn't want that, she can take her kids back again. How mean do you have to be to just piggyback on another persons babysitter without them even knowing?", "Nta.  God.  Too many monkey speaking for your sil but none would help her pay.  Stupid fella", "NTA\n\nBut by this logic, anything you have, your SIL is entitled to because she doesn't have the money for it and you do?  Does SIL get to use your car because she doesn't have as nice of one?  Can she move into your home?\n\nI don't fully believe that Eve's limited language was the problem, I imagine she knew what was going on, but I do believe that people working towards getting their citizenship are easily bullied.  And that is what I believe was going on.\n\nSIL and that side of the family are just wrong.", "NTA. I would basically set up cameras in your home to monitor the situation, tell Eve she is not to let SIL or her children in your home when she is babysitting your children. Also let her know that she has broken your trust and if it does happen again she will need to look for another job. She is your employee not SIL's.", "NTA - tho I agree with some others.  \nI\u2019d be angry with Eve.  \nShe\u2019s being paid to look after your children and by watching your SILs children too your children aren\u2019t being watched as much, they are getting less attention", "Does Eve want the extra money or for the extra kids to stop? This sub has had plenty of \"I'm a babysitter, my employers unilaterally changed my conditions, AITA to leave?\" posts. Eve is your employee, not property to \"share.\" Does she know from you that you don't expect her to look after these extra kids? Have you made it clear that she is meant to be saying no to your sister?

Or shit like \" oh they'll just nap the whole time, I shouldn't have to pay for that\"\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Eve's encountered that kinda stuff before, and since OP is a good client and does seem to treat her well, she was just afraid of losing a good client bc of the asshole sister.

Push it and ask for it yo be venmoed in advance. \n\nMake it clear to Eve that this is not her problem, it is your husbands and he can help you both by saying watching other kids without  consent is not part of her contract.", "NTA\n\nYour husband\u2019s family is taking advantage of Eve and hiding it from you.", "You would be the AH to fire a woman in a vulnerable position, who's boss's husband gave his jerk sister permission to dump her kids on the nanny, yes. What is she supposed to do in that situation exactly?", "Change Eve\u2019s phone number. Or give her a google voice number", "You do realize that she edited that in later after I posted my original comment?", "It's so disgusting that so many people are fine exploiting someone's labor and time. \n\nIt's refreshing that you pay well and stuck up for her when she was being taken advantage of.", "Oh I apologize.", "NTA and if SIL pushes it again by trying to contact Eve I\u2019d tell her that as Eves employer you aren\u2019t okay with her taking on extra kids when she\u2019s supposed to be watching yours- and that she needs to stop harassing your nanny!", "NTA\n\nTell your in-laws that if your SIL ever does this again, you will call the police for child abandonment.

Thank you for protecting Eve. You pay her a certain amount for a certain amount of work (i.e. no extra kids no warning). That is the job/contract/expectations. It's not fair on her.", "NTA!!", "NTA. Eve is a Saint! Like who tf uses someone that kind? Like I'm fumming.", "The problem is you\u2019re yelling at the wrong person. If she left them outside at Walmart, then you\u2019d be yelling at her. The fact that she leaves them at my home doesn\u2019t shift the responsibility onto me. You should be yelling at the negligent parent. Not shifting responsibility."]}
