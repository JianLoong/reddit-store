Eve is a generous and kindhearted person who I know would have a difficult time saying no to a pushy person like my sister-in-law. Eve did say that she prefers that sil didn\u2019t but she doesn\u2019t want to cause trouble and didn\u2019t want me to do anything.\n\nSo over the weekend I had a chat with sil and I asked her to stop asking Eve to take care of her kids and that she needed to look into daycare or get her own nanny as Eve will no longer be doing free childcare for her. I even gave her the details of nanny/babysitter service that could match her with someone. \n\nSince then my in-laws have been on my ass pretty much. They\u2019re saying that I should \u201cshare\u201d Eve with sil and when I sarcastically asked if they\u2019d go half\u2019s with me and we\u2019d split Eve\u2019s 80k salary and suddenly it\u2019s sil could never afford that. I of course knew she couldn\u2019t pay even half her wages. So I asked her to then at least pay her 25 an hour every time she dumps her kids on her. This also was met with she can\u2019t afford it. \n\nSo I told her that if she can\u2019t afford it than she\u2019d need to watch her own kids. Apparently that was rude and I\u2019m using my money to bully them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole in this and in fact I think they are for thinking it\u2019s normal to have free childcare. My husband is also pissing me off too because he thinks I\u2019m being an asshole for saying anything and for even ask they pay. Now after having discussed this with my colleague I\u2019m starting to doubt it as she pointed out that Eve has been put into awkward situation since my sil did text her asking if she was okay with her having dropped her kids off with her. \n\nBut the thing is I know Eve I know she\u2019s just too shy to say no or she\u2019s possibly worried that this could maybe effect her job(not that it would and I have reassured Eve that her job is in no way or shape in jeopardy) \n\nSo am I being an asshole and should I let it go?", "created_utc": 1692683757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xwibh/aita_for_demanding_my_sisterinlaw_pay_my/", "score": 271, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister in law ITA and needs to find her own sitter, even if she starts paying Eve because of how she fucked her over multiple times.", "NTA\n\nIf your SIL thought she was doing the right thing, she wouldn't have hidden it from you for a year and a half. It's not your job to pay for childcare for your niece(s)/nephew(s). \n\nYou are well within your rights to be pissed and don't give in.", "NTA. She is taking the piss! Definitely well within your right to ask for her to contribute", "I don\u2019t even know how to rule. Your SIL and her family all suck.\n\nBut honestly, I would be upset with Eve too. Being a nice person does not mean you allow yourself to be a doormat. *a year and a half?* like how did this all start? Does SIL have a key or did Eve let her in? How did she get Eve\u2019s number to ask her to begin with?\n\nWhat else does she allow because she\u2019s afraid of confrontation?", "NTA, you are paying Eve $80k for x number of kids, it\u2019s not fair for her to watch x+2 kids at the same rate. Similarly, it\u2019s not fair for you to pay any additional costs. SIL can watch her own kids if she can\u2019t afford childcare, your inlaws can help.", "NTA. When Eve was hired, I'm sure there was a discussion regarding the role and her responsibilities. Your SIL dropping her kids off, unannounced, was surely not part of that discussion and absolutely deviates from what she was told she could expect to do in her day. Eve needs to be compensated for any extra work she's doing. Your husband should also realize that this intrusion by his sister can cause Eve to leave and put the two of you in a bind.", "NTA. **You** hired the babysitter for **your** kids. Period. SIL can piss off unless she want to share the bill.", "NTA\n\nInform Eve that from now on, she is not to let anyone into your home.  Then let SIL  stand outside the door and knock and ring the doorbell until she can't anymore.  Make sure that Eve realizes that you are her employer, and that having SIL in your home is not acceptable when you are not there.  Eve is nice, but she needs to be firm in this, as you aren't at home to enforce your household's rules.  Following your rules is part of Eve's job.  Eve doesn't need to say anything when SIL comes to the door.  She just needs to keep the door locked and closed to SIL.  \n\nIf you know the date that SIL comes over, then you can make sure Eve isn't there that day.  If you can get off work, you could stay home that day and wait for SIL to show up.  \n\nThe fact that SIL was sneaky about it means that she knows she is freeloading.  Otherwise, she would have asked if it was okay before dropping the kids off.  \n\nWhile SIL may not be able to afford $25/hour, she can afford something.  But that isn't the point.  The point is that she did this without your permission, invaded your home without asking, and expected free work from your employee.  \n\nThere are plenty of parents who bring their kids everywhere - grocery shopping, hair appointments, doctor appointments, etc. - as they don't have a babysitter.  \n\nIf your family is so involved, then they should babysit SIL's kids.", "You hired Eve to care for your children. Sis-in-law (SIL) went behind your back to use your nanny for free childcare, somehow for six months before you found out. I'm not surprised Eve didn't mind, but surprised she didn't inform you as her employer!  How is she so cozy with SIL that she's ok having her kids around yours without asking you--at 80 grand a year! \n\n You're NTA for expecting SIL to contribute ~something~ for using a service you pay for.  And YWNBTA to find out why Eve felt she had to keep this on the QT for so long! Some vital piece of information is missing here", "How bout  sil drop the hair and nails and the gym and whatever else  and be a Mother.   Maybe that's why she can't afford it.   Or everyone bitching can pay your nanny. \n\n Seeing lots of overworked Nanny/babysitters on the nanny site here I'm surprised she  puts up with it.", "NTA, however this is also a little on Eve for not being firm with her business. I get its hard, but she needs to know the value of her labor. I think its great that you've stepped in to be a middle man, but Eve giving sis the formal permission to do this is also whats causing the problem. If sis is being told it's ok, she may think she's just getting helped out. \n\nAnd if you wanna help boost Eve up, since she mentioned \"not wanting to cause problems\", you can sit her down and just say something like \n\n\"You aren't gonna cause problems if you don't wanna watch my sister's kids for free. I'm your client here, I'm the one paying you, so I'm not gonna be mad if you only do what I'm paying you to do, which is watch MY kids. You can tell my sister no. And if she gets upset, just call me I'll deal with her. She's not your responsibility\"\n\nHell you can even tell your sister something like \"I don't want my house being used as a daycare so stop bringing them to us.\"", "NTA. You pay for Eve to watch and spend time with YOUR kid(s). While I'm sure Eve can handle two more kids for a few hours, it inevitably takes some of her attention away from those she is being paid to watch. \n\nI will allow that if SIL had asked in advance, and it was only on occasion, and Eve was okay with it,  then maybe it would have been right to help SIL out. But her going ahead and just doing this for 18 months? Hell no", "Eve is your employee.   You determine what kids she takes care of and when.  She really does not have a say in it.  \n\nIf you had a friend who worked as a secretary, you wouldn't walk into her employers business and hand her stuff you need typed when you don't even work there.  That's effectively what SIL is doing when she drops her kids off and expects your nanny to care for them.\n\nNTA", "Wow NTA.  The entitlement is outrageous. Can\u2019t afford it so should have it for free. I can\u2019t afford a Porsche but I want one so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine if I just rock up at the dealership and they\u2019ll give me one.  I feel sorry for Eve, this isn\u2019t even a money issue, this is just not abusing people.", "NTA, your sil is taking advantage of Eve's kindness. But, Eve should also put her foot down on her own, she really should block your sil's number or don't answer the door for her.", "NTA - SIL is clearly the primary asshole.\n\nI am also wondering if I am the asshole while reading this, my immediate reaction would be to fire Eve and hire a more competent nanny.", "Nta. You jired Eve to tale care of your children. When she drop jers Eve have less attention t give your children because of that. You want someone who have full attention on  your child. And she wasnt hired to take of all the children of the family only yours.", "NTA. Tell Eve that when your SIL stands in front of your door that she should tell her to pay her x amount of money in cash before she can drop off the kids. If she can't or doesn't want that, she can take her kids back again. How mean do you have to be to just piggyback on another persons babysitter without them even knowing?", "Nta.  God.  Too many monkey speaking for your sil but none would help her pay.  Stupid fella", "NTA\n\nBut by this logic, anything you have, your SIL is entitled to because she doesn't have the money for it and you do?  Does SIL get to use your car because she doesn't have as nice of one?  Can she move into your home?\n\nI don't fully believe that Eve's limited language was the problem, I imagine she knew what was going on, but I do believe that people working towards getting their citizenship are easily bullied.  And that is what I believe was going on.\n\nSIL and that side of the family are just wrong.", "NTA. I would basically set up cameras in your home to monitor the situation, tell Eve she is not to let SIL or her children in your home when she is babysitting your children. Also let her know that she has broken your trust and if it does happen again she will need to look for another job. She is your employee not SIL's.", "NTA - tho I agree with some others.  \nI\u2019d be angry with Eve.  \nShe\u2019s being paid to look after your children and by watching your SILs children too your children aren\u2019t being watched as much, they are getting less attention", "Does Eve want the extra money or for the extra kids to stop? This sub has had plenty of \"I'm a babysitter, my employers unilaterally changed my conditions, AITA to leave?\" posts. Eve is your employee, not property to \"share.\" Does she know from you that you don't expect her to look after these extra kids? Have you made it clear that she is meant to be saying no to your sister?

Or shit like \" oh they'll just nap the whole time, I shouldn't have to pay for that\"\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Eve's encountered that kinda stuff before, and since OP is a good client and does seem to treat her well, she was just afraid of losing a good client bc of the asshole sister.

You're going to get sued. You should take the SIL to court for all the $$ she owes Eve. Why in the hell does your SIL even have your nanny's number? Who is paying Eve? What is your husband's problem? NTA. Cut the SIL off.", "NTA but $25/h on top of her salary is a LOT. I would ask Eve what she thinks would fair.  IE and additional $10/h for a max of 4 h.", "NTA your husband who homey get on him. Her financial situation is not your problems and if it's a problem hunny can pay for them to go somewhere else. Do you know how disrespectful that is and how that girl could one leave and two report it. She is not authorized to watch them and could easily take them to the police station and claimed mom abandoned them. They can be mad at they want to but they not gonna step on someone else back. Tell eve do not open the door and ignore. Anybody got a problem tell them to pay oh you don't have the money welp sounds like she needs to figure it out.", "NTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nGet those leeches away from you", "NTA!!  Stand your ground on this one OP.", "NTA, Eve works for you, and you and her probably have insurance, liability forms and all that shit. Ask your SIL who's gonna cover, and under what insurance if something happens.   \nAsk her how and with whom Eve should call if something happens, and what hospital and dentist is the preferred one.   \n\n\nIF she can tell Eve all that, have Eve tell her \"These are my rates, my contact numbers, and my hours billable. This is who I've worked for before, and this is what information I'd like from you;   \n\n\n* *Cell and home number*. \n* *Email and postal adress*. \n* *Insurance cards, and a full updated list on vaccinations and health check*. \n* *List of pre approved things to do, and what is not allowed*. \n\nIf she can do that, then, there is a time for her to say; Starting rate before 6pm, is 25$ hour/kid. After hours is 35$/kid.", "NTA some people need permission to stand up for themselves. Please tell your sitter you prefer for her to focus on your kids.\n\nWhat if she was taking in the kids from nearby houses? You\u2019d be miffed and think your kids were not getting the care and attention you are paying for.\n\nIn-laws are welcome to mind the kids, or pay for her to get her own childminder.", "NTA, but your relationship with your SIL is toast, but that's not necessarily your fault. What a messed up situation.", "NTA. Eve need to be compensated for the year and half of work she did while being conned by your SIL. If your SIL really thought it was above board, it wouldn\u2019t have been a secret for over a year!", "NTA. SIL has money for her hair, nails, and the gym. She has money to pay Eve. She\u2019s being a cheap asshole. Make sure to tell in laws that. \n\nEve is not working for free. She needs to shut sil down too. Your husband should have your back. This whole situation is messed up.\n\nGood for you defending eve. The girl deserves to get paid and it\u2019s not fair to eve that your sil gets free labor.", "I'm so confused, eve babysit your kids, and sil just dump her kids on top of that? She should've asked for your premssion, Eve's premssion (and beforehand, not pushing at the moment) and of course pay her for the extra work. NTA", "NTA. Show your husband and his asshole family this post and replies", "Wow. I won\u2019t even judge here, but how in the world was this happening for a year and a half without you knowing? Eve might be a great babysitter, but if this had been going on in my house for a year and a half and she hadn\u2019t told me, I\u2019d actually be a little upset with Eve too. I think you need to have a real talk with her about the kind of information she shares with you.", "NTA. It's 2023. Human exploitation is not cool.", "Boundaries. They need to be set with the in laws", "Eve is a pushover who won't stick up for herself.\nEve is a yta to herself.   \nI doesn't matter what Op does because Eve is not going stick up for herself.   \nOp can't change sil and neither can she change Eve.", "You are not accounting for the perceived power differential between Eve and SIL. OP is being very supportive of Eve but it\u2019s challenging for an employee to stand up to the relative of an employer under the best of circumstances. SIL has abused her power over Eve and completely manipulated the circumstances.", "Eve might not be afraid of confrontation per se, like if a stranger, for example, would harass kids at a playground, she would confront him. But confronting boss' SIL is another story, she might be afraid to lose her job,", "I know! I need to start babysitting! \ud83d\ude02", "Don\u2019t know where OP is but in the US few states even have legal protections for domestic employees like nannies FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT- or an existing legal minimum wage. \n\nThe majority of domestic employees aren\u2019t white, are women and mostly immigrants- the most marginalized groups of society are the champions of private childcare.", "Yep, op has every right to her employees' undivided attention for her kids.\n\nMore kids less quality of time spent, eve also would be restricted in what activities / trips etc she could do during that time and I assume op would absorb all food and drink costs without knowing.", "Thank you for valuing the service Eve provides.", "That\u2019s gross behaviour by SIL. She took advantage of Eve. It\u2019s kind of racist.", "Why did you leave this out of the post? This is important. This is hedging close to coercion. You need to end this now, tell them all SIL is hitting criminal behavior and Eve could sue her. It has nothing to do with Eve being kind hearted or saying no to a pushy person.", "Time for eve to get a new phone number.", "Yeah you do sound shitty. Eve is in a very vulnerable situation where she was worried about losing her chance at citizenship. SIL manipulated and abused Eve but we should totally punish Eve more. OP\u2019s kids were around their cousins. They weren\u2019t harmed in any way. Eve is the one that was taken advantage of and made to give free labor.", "Did Eve not give any reports about the day?\n\nAre OPs children pre-verbal?\n\nIf Eve's language barrier could ex\\[lain SiL's ability to trick her, us her English good enough to communicate with the children? (I guess irrelevant if they aren't verbal)", "Not sure i understand the \"nope\" in this comment because i think we're agreeing - there is no good reason for expecting Eve to look after the extra kids, and going straight to \"someone in the family should be paying her more\" isn't good for anyone except the sister", "Nope should have been yep. Fat fingers and all.\nFixed", "Got it"]}
