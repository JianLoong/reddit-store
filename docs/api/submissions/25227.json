Eve is a generous and kindhearted person who I know would have a difficult time saying no to a pushy person like my sister-in-law. Eve did say that she prefers that sil didn\u2019t but she doesn\u2019t want to cause trouble and didn\u2019t want me to do anything.\n\nSo over the weekend I had a chat with sil and I asked her to stop asking Eve to take care of her kids and that she needed to look into daycare or get her own nanny as Eve will no longer be doing free childcare for her. I even gave her the details of nanny/babysitter service that could match her with someone. \n\nSince then my in-laws have been on my ass pretty much. They\u2019re saying that I should \u201cshare\u201d Eve with sil and when I sarcastically asked if they\u2019d go half\u2019s with me and we\u2019d split Eve\u2019s 80k salary and suddenly it\u2019s sil could never afford that. I of course knew she couldn\u2019t pay even half her wages. So I asked her to then at least pay her 25 an hour every time she dumps her kids on her. This also was met with she can\u2019t afford it. \n\nSo I told her that if she can\u2019t afford it than she\u2019d need to watch her own kids. Apparently that was rude and I\u2019m using my money to bully them. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the asshole in this and in fact I think they are for thinking it\u2019s normal to have free childcare. My husband is also pissing me off too because he thinks I\u2019m being an asshole for saying anything and for even ask they pay. Now after having discussed this with my colleague I\u2019m starting to doubt it as she pointed out that Eve has been put into awkward situation since my sil did text her asking if she was okay with her having dropped her kids off with her. \n\nBut the thing is I know Eve I know she\u2019s just too shy to say no or she\u2019s possibly worried that this could maybe effect her job(not that it would and I have reassured Eve that her job is in no way or shape in jeopardy) \n\nSo am I being an asshole and should I let it go?", "created_utc": 1692683757, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xwibh/aita_for_demanding_my_sisterinlaw_pay_my/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not your sister in law. Ask Eve to block her number and never allow her to drop her children off again. Your sister in law ITA and needs to find her own sitter, even if she starts paying Eve because of how she fucked her over multiple times.", "NTA\n\nIf your SIL thought she was doing the right thing, she wouldn't have hidden it from you for a year and a half. It's not your job to pay for childcare for your niece(s)/nephew(s). \n\nYou are well within your rights to be pissed and don't give in.", "NTA. She is taking the piss! Definitely well within your right to ask for her to contribute", "I don\u2019t even know how to rule. Your SIL and her family all suck.\n\nBut honestly, I would be upset with Eve too. Being a nice person does not mean you allow yourself to be a doormat. *a year and a half?* like how did this all start? Does SIL have a key or did Eve let her in? How did she get Eve\u2019s number to ask her to begin with?\n\nWhat else does she allow because she\u2019s afraid of confrontation?", "NTA, you are paying Eve $80k for x number of kids, it\u2019s not fair for her to watch x+2 kids at the same rate. Similarly, it\u2019s not fair for you to pay any additional costs. SIL can watch her own kids if she can\u2019t afford childcare, your inlaws can help.", "NTA. When Eve was hired, I'm sure there was a discussion regarding the role and her responsibilities. Your SIL dropping her kids off, unannounced, was surely not part of that discussion and absolutely deviates from what she was told she could expect to do in her day. Eve needs to be compensated for any extra work she's doing. Your husband should also realize that this intrusion by his sister can cause Eve to leave and put the two of you in a bind.", "NTA. **You** hired the babysitter for **your** kids. Period. SIL can piss off unless she want to share the bill.", "NTA\n\nInform Eve that from now on, she is not to let anyone into your home.  Then let SIL  stand outside the door and knock and ring the doorbell until she can't anymore.  Make sure that Eve realizes that you are her employer, and that having SIL in your home is not acceptable when you are not there.  Eve is nice, but she needs to be firm in this, as you aren't at home to enforce your household's rules.  Following your rules is part of Eve's job.  Eve doesn't need to say anything when SIL comes to the door.  She just needs to keep the door locked and closed to SIL.  \n\nIf you know the date that SIL comes over, then you can make sure Eve isn't there that day.  If you can get off work, you could stay home that day and wait for SIL to show up.  \n\nThe fact that SIL was sneaky about it means that she knows she is freeloading.  Otherwise, she would have asked if it was okay before dropping the kids off.  \n\nWhile SIL may not be able to afford $25/hour, she can afford something.  But that isn't the point.  The point is that she did this without your permission, invaded your home without asking, and expected free work from your employee.  \n\nThere are plenty of parents who bring their kids everywhere - grocery shopping, hair appointments, doctor appointments, etc. - as they don't have a babysitter.  \n\nIf your family is so involved, then they should babysit SIL's kids.", "You hired Eve to care for your children. Sis-in-law (SIL) went behind your back to use your nanny for free childcare, somehow for six months before you found out. I'm not surprised Eve didn't mind, but surprised she didn't inform you as her employer!  How is she so cozy with SIL that she's ok having her kids around yours without asking you--at 80 grand a year! \n\n You're NTA for expecting SIL to contribute ~something~ for using a service you pay for.  And YWNBTA to find out why Eve felt she had to keep this on the QT for so long! Some vital piece of information is missing here", "How bout  sil drop the hair and nails and the gym and whatever else  and be a Mother.   Maybe that's why she can't afford it.   Or everyone bitching can pay your nanny. \n\n Seeing lots of overworked Nanny/babysitters on the nanny site here I'm surprised she  puts up with it.", "NTA, however this is also a little on Eve for not being firm with her business. I get its hard, but she needs to know the value of her labor. I think its great that you've stepped in to be a middle man, but Eve giving sis the formal permission to do this is also whats causing the problem. If sis is being told it's ok, she may think she's just getting helped out. \n\nAnd if you wanna help boost Eve up, since she mentioned \"not wanting to cause problems\", you can sit her down and just say something like \n\n\"You aren't gonna cause problems if you don't wanna watch my sister's kids for free. I'm your client here, I'm the one paying you, so I'm not gonna be mad if you only do what I'm paying you to do, which is watch MY kids. You can tell my sister no. And if she gets upset, just call me I'll deal with her. She's not your responsibility\"\n\nHell you can even tell your sister something like \"I don't want my house being used as a daycare so stop bringing them to us.\"", "NTA. You pay for Eve to watch and spend time with YOUR kid(s). While I'm sure Eve can handle two more kids for a few hours, it inevitably takes some of her attention away from those she is being paid to watch. \n\nI will allow that if SIL had asked in advance, and it was only on occasion, and Eve was okay with it,  then maybe it would have been right to help SIL out. But her going ahead and just doing this for 18 months? Hell no", "Eve is your employee.   You determine what kids she takes care of and when.  She really does not have a say in it.  \n\nIf you had a friend who worked as a secretary, you wouldn't walk into her employers business and hand her stuff you need typed when you don't even work there.  That's effectively what SIL is doing when she drops her kids off and expects your nanny to care for them.\n\nNTA", "Wow NTA.  The entitlement is outrageous. Can\u2019t afford it so should have it for free. I can\u2019t afford a Porsche but I want one so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine if I just rock up at the dealership and they\u2019ll give me one.  I feel sorry for Eve, this isn\u2019t even a money issue, this is just not abusing people.", "NTA, your sil is taking advantage of Eve's kindness. But, Eve should also put her foot down on her own, she really should block your sil's number or don't answer the door for her.", "NTA - SIL is clearly the primary asshole.\n\nI am also wondering if I am the asshole while reading this, my immediate reaction would be to fire Eve and hire a more competent nanny.", "Nta. You jired Eve to tale care of your children. When she drop jers Eve have less attention t give your children because of that. You want someone who have full attention on  your child. And she wasnt hired to take of all the children of the family only yours.", "NTA. Tell Eve that when your SIL stands in front of your door that she should tell her to pay her x amount of money in cash before she can drop off the kids. If she can't or doesn't want that, she can take her kids back again. How mean do you have to be to just piggyback on another persons babysitter without them even knowing?", "Nta.  God.  Too many monkey speaking for your sil but none would help her pay.  Stupid fella", "NTA\n\nBut by this logic, anything you have, your SIL is entitled to because she doesn't have the money for it and you do?  Does SIL get to use your car because she doesn't have as nice of one?  Can she move into your home?\n\nI don't fully believe that Eve's limited language was the problem, I imagine she knew what was going on, but I do believe that people working towards getting their citizenship are easily bullied.  And that is what I believe was going on.\n\nSIL and that side of the family are just wrong.", "NTA. I would basically set up cameras in your home to monitor the situation, tell Eve she is not to let SIL or her children in your home when she is babysitting your children. Also let her know that she has broken your trust and if it does happen again she will need to look for another job. She is your employee not SIL's.", "NTA - tho I agree with some others.  \nI\u2019d be angry with Eve.  \nShe\u2019s being paid to look after your children and by watching your SILs children too your children aren\u2019t being watched as much, they are getting less attention", "Does Eve want the extra money or for the extra kids to stop? This sub has had plenty of \"I'm a babysitter, my employers unilaterally changed my conditions, AITA to leave?\" posts. Eve is your employee, not property to \"share.\" Does she know from you that you don't expect her to look after these extra kids? Have you made it clear that she is meant to be saying no to your sister? Look after Eve, she'll look after your kids - don't expect her to stay with your family if she's left in the middle of this dispute. ESH except Eve.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The issue is my sil has weaseled her way in by using Eve\u2019s limited English against her. She had Eve believing that I agreed to this and since Eve is in the process of getting her citizenship she couldn\u2019t easily afford losing her job. So sil in a indirect way used that to her advantage. \n\nSister-in-law had Eve\u2019s number as there have been a few times in the past where she had babysat for her (all paid for an agreed to in advance).", "This sounds really shitty on my part but I would consider replacing Eve as the babysitter.\n\nThey hired Eve to take care of their children. And extra kids were added on and she never brought this up?\n\nI get not wanting to rock the boat, but this is a level of not rocking the boat that makes her seem like an incompetent sitter.\n\nWhat if SIL asked to take OPs children with her? or made other requests that went against OPs wishes with her own children? Is Eve going to just comply without telling OP?", "I would straight up fire Eve. Seems like she can\u2019t actually do the job she was hired for.", "Not to open the door at all.

Secondly, I would come up with an average number of hours that SIL dropped kids off her week and then come up with an amount that that amounts to and tell her that if she doesn\u2019t refund you that amount (since you paid for childcare) then she\u2019s not welcome around you at all. In essence, SIL stole from you and your husband. You paid for a service, she unlawfully used it. She intimidated Eve using false pretenses. And since I am petty, I would threaten to tell Eve\u2019s lawyer (assuming she got one to help with her citizenship) about SIL\u2019s unlawful behavior. Best case- it gets them off your ass. Worst case- pisses them off and they stop talking to you and I doubt that\u2019s a loss for you.

Along with an apology.\n\nI would tell your husband either back you, as his Sister manipulated and lied for a considerable amount of time about this. \n\nChange your locks,  tell Eve that SIL is not allowed in the house and if she turns up to call you. You employ and sponsor her, tell her to be open and honest about anything else that has happened and anything else that occurs now.\n\nIf it is so important to your husband and his family,  they can chip in the full amount (out of their personal money)", "Your SIL is not only entitled she\u2019s exploitative and evil. Please don\u2019t let her anywhere near Eve and ban her completely, even if she offers to pay she should get her own nanny/babysitter.", "The fact that she looks after extra kids means OPs kids aren\u2019t getting the attention they are paying for", "i wouldn't go that far since it sounds like OP has no issues with her outside this incident, but yeah she does need to learn fast how to conduct her business if she wants to keep in business lol.\n\nIts a problem overall with how we structure our labor market. We train kids up from birth to believe their labor is valueless and that the all mighty dollar is the most important part and you should be licking your bosses toes for the GIFT of employment, yadda yadda. I don't doubt there are people who would be legitimately MAD at Eve for not watching their sister's kids for free.\n\n Coming from someone who's also worked childcare, you get a lot of entitled people in that industry. The amount of times I heard \"what its just 1 more kid, you're already watching 3 of them, so you're not actually doing any more work\".  Or shit like \" oh they'll just nap the whole time, I shouldn't have to pay for that\"\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Eve's encountered that kinda stuff before, and since OP is a good client and does seem to treat her well, she was just afraid of losing a good client bc of the asshole sister. But she should have also known, a truly good client wouldn't be mad about rightfully saying \"I don't work for free\". Now that OP has made it clear she shouldn't look after sisters kids, now the ball is truly in her court. Can she adult up and say no, or is she gonna be a push over?", "This is what I would do too. And whatever extra that is give it to Eve as a bonus. She watched extra kids? It\u2019s normal and expected that the nanny gets extra in this circumstance", "Thank you. Those are some really good points. Childcare is so tricky it is sometimes better to take a deep breath and think."]}
