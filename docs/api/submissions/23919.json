All I can say is that you just reach out and then you voice out your concerns, you don't apologize you just apologize for the whole misunderstanding but you did nothing wrong you were told and it's not like you could have called the bride and groom beforehand to say thank you for the opportunity and such like that but it is what it is and you shouldn't feel bad you should at least know where to start from and try to see if you can salvage at least a courtesy talk.

It\u2019s usually after the food and speeches. \n\nShe is 16 and most pianos set in the middle of a public venue are meant to be played.  Also many weddings have background music during cocktails. Perhaps you haven't been to such weddings. \n\n>But in real life people don\u2019t just expect someone to jump on a piano just because it\u2019s there.\n\nIn real life pianos on the middle of public places are there to be played.  Unless they are in a museum or cordoned off.  It's exactly why pianos that aren't meant to be played are cordoned off because otherwise people correctly assumed that they are there to be played. \n\n>That would mean that any random person at that wedding could do the same, and that\u2019s probably what the bride thought she was doing.\n\nWhich is what the piano was there for.  And doesn't mean that anyone was trying to steal her thunder.  A random person playing a piano is not trying to steal your thunder and yelling at then for doing so is ridiculous. \n\n>Being a random teenager who felt the urge to play. She was an AH but she didn\u2019t know OP.\n\nAnd so the correct impulse was to assume that someone randomly playing a piano in the middle of a public venue was out to steal your thunder?  If the bride was this sensitive she should have had the piano moved or cordoned off.", "At a venue the public is allowed into.  A public venue.  OP was there, the piano was there are not cordoned off.  Since the venue is open to the public a reasonable assumption is that members of the public would play it.  Be it at an event or otherwise.", "The venue put it there because some events will need one, and it's easier to bring a piano in once and leave it there than to move it all the time. It doesn't mean channel Rachmaninoff when the DJ is spinning Uptown Funk.", "So much hostility lol\n\n\u2026 I literally said the bride was an AH so idk why you\u2019re arguing with me about it. We also don\u2019t know where the piano was placed exactly so \u201cin the middle\u201d doesn\u2019t mean anything. I also said she could\u2019ve been there for background noise and ambiance, again\u2026 don\u2019t know why you picked a fight about that. \n\nAgain, none of this was OP\u2019s fault, it clearly lies with the FIL but to think that just because a piano is present at a **wedding reception** meant anyone was free to play it during anytime is crazy lol. Imagine wanting to get to the speeches but you have to wait because somebodies third cousin decided they wanted to do a random 15 minute jazz session because a piano just so happens to be nearby. Or having a band that\u2019s been paid and ready to start their set but not until your niece finishes her recital piece for everyone lol", ">The venue put it there because some events will need one, and it's easier to bring a piano in once and leave it there than to move it all the tim\n\nSo then it's there to be played it wasn't roped or cordoned off.  Pianos have wheels, it wasn't wheeled into a discrete corner.  It was there to be used.", "In this case, the FOG may have moved it because he planned it. I mean in general. If you go somewhere and there's a piano in the corner, and no one is expecting you to play it, read the room."]}
