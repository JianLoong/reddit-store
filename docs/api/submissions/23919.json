Your family is right in telling you not to apologize, because you have nothing to apologize for. You were told to play at the event, you were led to the piano by the person you thought organized the event, you played. You weren't even part of the miscommunication. \n\nI understand that a wedding can be a lot of stress, but the one that made this a bad situation was the bride, not you. She could've just let you finish playing and nobody would've thought anything of it, instead she decided to make a scene on her own \"special day\".", "NTA, there was definitely a miscommunication. But also the bride should stop and think about why a young woman playing a nice tune on the piano made her so insecure.", "NTA. If there is an AH, it's the groom's father who arranged the whole thing without coordinating with the newlyweds.", "NTA, not at all. I'm sorry you had to go through such a shameful situation like that.", "Got a feeling this extends beyond a wedding and deep into some interfamilial scuffles. Me thinks this wasn\u2019t informed to the couple as it was the goal to steal the spotlight, and they used you as a tool to do it.\n\nYou\u2019re sweet for wanting to apologise, honestly sounds like a good idea to at least reach out, maybe to the groom? Do keep in mind that any insults you might receive aren\u2019t deserved and that you did everything right. \n\nNTA OP.", "NTA, the bride sounds really self-absorbed. There's no way you did anything wrong and it's not on you to do an in-depth investigation on who all is informed when someone from the \"inner circle\" asks you to contribute to the wedding and nothing seems fishy about it. Honestly I think a lot of brides would either react to the surprise as \"huh, that's nice\" at the very worst. It's not unusual to have live music played at a wedding or for friends/family to do something in honor of the bride/groom. Honestly if you don't plan on having a long-term relationship with her, I would just kind of sit back and let their family deal with it. You already told her you were invited to play and I don't think you have anything else to apologize for after explaining that", "NTA at all. You have a very good heart, OP. I wish you didn\u2019t have to go through this. I hope you get a well deserved apology from the bride.", "NTA\n\nYou are 16, so still techincially a child. You were just doing as you were told.", "NTA but neither is the bride. The groom's father can't just arrange a performance at the wedding without checking with the couple that they want it!", "It\u2019s tricky to figure out who the AH is here but one thing is clear \u2014 it\u2019s not you.  NTA", "NTA\n\nAlso no need to appologize!\nAt best, say \"sorry for the miscommunication\".\n\nBut i'd suggest reaching to the couple and informing them (politely) who arranged it for you to play there.\n\nIf there has been any social media posts about it, do the same there.\n\nTell people who arranged it *and* state you have no intention in getting involved in what seems to be a very sticky situation.", "You're definitely NTA.", "NTA\nHiring musicians is pretty common at weddings, as is asking musical friends to play.", "no way you're the asshole, you did literally what yu were asked, I think it's the bride that has some anger management issues instead \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt's not like you walked down the isle pretending to be the bride or something", "NAH, you weren't informed so wasn't the bride. If it weighs on you that much, you can say you are sorry, but to be honest, you did nothing wrong, it was the groom's father, who did", "NTA\n\nThe groom's father made the arrangement and most people would be delighted to have a pianist play live at the wedding. Her behaviour was crass. She didn't wait for the explanation which the FIL was trying to give. She behaved badly.\n\nYou have nothing to apologise for and you are far too generous to this rather unpleasant woman.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was very very delusion to think that a wedding pianist and performer can steal her bride spotlight. NTA.", "NTA. It's not your fault that nobody checked with her and she shouldn't have blown up at you like that.", "NTA, this sounds like an issue between the bride and the in laws. I think you were set up specifically to upset the bride which is extremely unfair on you and not your fault.", "That's what I was thinking, why is it bad for someone to play the piano? Would have loved it myself...", "I think the grooms father and the bride are AHs.  \nThe bride could have gone up to her quietly and asked her to stop instead she yells at the poor girl even after it was explained she was asked to do it", "Eh, I dunno, surprise musical performances are a thing in some social circles.\n\nI had a surprise trumpeter announce my arrival at the wedding. And my husband and some relatives arranged a surprise chamber piece.", "It\u2019s bad because it\u2019s her wedding and no one asked her.

I'd see it as free entertainment honestly. \nNow if they were awful I'd get someone to discreetly remove them and probably have a good laugh about it with my mates. So yeah still not going to ruin things with an overreaction.\n\nNow the bride could have asked hubby/in-laws if they knew what was going on as I would assume it was a surprise and want to thank them."]}
