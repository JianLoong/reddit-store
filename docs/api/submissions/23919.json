Your family is right in telling you not to apologize, because you have nothing to apologize for. You were told to play at the event, you were led to the piano by the person you thought organized the event, you played. You weren't even part of the miscommunication. \n\nI understand that a wedding can be a lot of stress, but the one that made this a bad situation was the bride, not you. She could've just let you finish playing and nobody would've thought anything of it, instead she decided to make a scene on her own \"special day\".", "NTA, there was definitely a miscommunication. But also the bride should stop and think about why a young woman playing a nice tune on the piano made her so insecure.", "NTA. If there is an AH, it's the groom's father who arranged the whole thing without coordinating with the newlyweds.", "NTA, not at all. I'm sorry you had to go through such a shameful situation like that.", "Got a feeling this extends beyond a wedding and deep into some interfamilial scuffles. Me thinks this wasn\u2019t informed to the couple as it was the goal to steal the spotlight, and they used you as a tool to do it.\n\nYou\u2019re sweet for wanting to apologise, honestly sounds like a good idea to at least reach out, maybe to the groom? Do keep in mind that any insults you might receive aren\u2019t deserved and that you did everything right. \n\nNTA OP.", "NTA, the bride sounds really self-absorbed. There's no way you did anything wrong and it's not on you to do an in-depth investigation on who all is informed when someone from the \"inner circle\" asks you to contribute to the wedding and nothing seems fishy about it. Honestly I think a lot of brides would either react to the surprise as \"huh, that's nice\" at the very worst. It's not unusual to have live music played at a wedding or for friends/family to do something in honor of the bride/groom. Honestly if you don't plan on having a long-term relationship with her, I would just kind of sit back and let their family deal with it. You already told her you were invited to play and I don't think you have anything else to apologize for after explaining that", "NTA at all. You have a very good heart, OP. I wish you didn\u2019t have to go through this. I hope you get a well deserved apology from the bride.", "NTA\n\nYou are 16, so still techincially a child. You were just doing as you were told.", "NTA but neither is the bride. The groom's father can't just arrange a performance at the wedding without checking with the couple that they want it!", "It\u2019s tricky to figure out who the AH is here but one thing is clear \u2014 it\u2019s not you.  NTA", "NTA\n\nAlso no need to appologize!\nAt best, say \"sorry for the miscommunication\".\n\nBut i'd suggest reaching to the couple and informing them (politely) who arranged it for you to play there.\n\nIf there has been any social media posts about it, do the same there.\n\nTell people who arranged it *and* state you have no intention in getting involved in what seems to be a very sticky situation.", "You're definitely NTA.", "NTA\nHiring musicians is pretty common at weddings, as is asking musical friends to play.", "no way you're the asshole, you did literally what yu were asked, I think it's the bride that has some anger management issues instead \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt's not like you walked down the isle pretending to be the bride or something", "NAH, you weren't informed so wasn't the bride. If it weighs on you that much, you can say you are sorry, but to be honest, you did nothing wrong, it was the groom's father, who did", "NTA\n\nThe groom's father made the arrangement and most people would be delighted to have a pianist play live at the wedding. Her behaviour was crass. She didn't wait for the explanation which the FIL was trying to give. She behaved badly.\n\nYou have nothing to apologise for and you are far too generous to this rather unpleasant woman.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was very very delusion to think that a wedding pianist and performer can steal her bride spotlight. NTA.", "NTA. It's not your fault that nobody checked with her and she shouldn't have blown up at you like that.", "NTA, this sounds like an issue between the bride and the in laws. I think you were set up specifically to upset the bride which is extremely unfair on you and not your fault.", "That's what I was thinking, why is it bad for someone to play the piano? Would have loved it myself...", "I think the grooms father and the bride are AHs.  \nThe bride could have gone up to her quietly and asked her to stop instead she yells at the poor girl even after it was explained she was asked to do it", "Eh, I dunno, surprise musical performances are a thing in some social circles.\n\nI had a surprise trumpeter announce my arrival at the wedding. And my husband and some relatives arranged a surprise chamber piece.", "It\u2019s bad because it\u2019s her wedding and no one asked her. Would you also love if your MIL got up and sang an I requested song for everyone? OP is NTA but neither is the bride for spotting someone she didn\u2019t even know from an unscheduled performance at her wedding.", "If MIL could sing then yeah would be great actually but then I like people enjoying themselves and never needed everything to be all about me not even my wedding. I'd see it as free entertainment honestly. \nNow if they were awful I'd get someone to discreetly remove them and probably have a good laugh about it with my mates. So yeah still not going to ruin things with an overreaction.\n\nNow the bride could have asked hubby/in-laws if they knew what was going on as I would assume it was a surprise and want to thank them.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t create this problem, the parents of the groom apparently wanted to surprise them with a live pianist for their wedding. It was a nice idea, but under most circumstances people who have live music at their wedding want the music to enhance the event, not *be* the event (or a spotlight moment at the event).", "You're NTA here, not one bit! \nIf something like that happened at my wedding, I would either just go along with it since it's such an obviously nice thing to do, or if I didn't like it I would approach the wedding organiser to ask who this girl at the piano is. Under no circumstances would I make a scene and make a child playing a song for me feel bad about herself!\nAlso the entire \"spotlight\" attitude is so narcissistic, are you being concentrated on your new husband and your love, or are you concentrated on yourself, your looks and checking how many people are watching you at any given time? Smh\n\nYou have nothing to apologize for whatsoever. The bride and her father need to apologize to you.", "NTA. You were invited to play. Both the grooms father and the bride are TA, him for asking you to play but not clearing it with the bride, her for blowing up at you when you tried to explain", "How are OPs parents not furious with their friend who put their minor child in this position?", "NTA - don\u2019t stress - bride sounds unhinged", "NTA. I don't know what happened there, but think, somebody arranged for the piano to be placed there. There were plans into your performance. If it was a surprise for the couple, or not, the bride was an AH to yell at you. She could have waited for you to finish. Gosh.", "What is with the bride? I\u2019d be THRILLED with a live performance at my wedding! So beautiful! NTA", "NAH except the brides father. You don't add a musical number to someone else's wedding! Especially since the bride didn't know you. All she saw was a complete stranger stage a concert in the middle of her wedding\n\nIn the future always confirm with the bride and groom", "NTA.", "YOU did nothing wrong.  You were given inaccurate information.\n\nThe people who \"ruined \" her day , the people who didn't communicate with each other are the ones who responsible.\n\nNTA", "Oh god NTA, this is entirely on the adults who couldn\u2019t get their shit together. And the bride for yelling at a teenager playing piano. How embarrassing for her.", "NTA\nYou did not just walk up and start playing randomly. You were requested to play and taken to the piano by the father of the groom. Maybe the parent's of the groom did not bother checking with the bride but that is on them not you.\n\nYou don't need to say or do anything more.", "She could have stood up with her husband and danced to live music, a personal serenade on her wedding day. She could have applauded the first song and encouraged a full set of music and told the guests that it was arranged as a gift by FIL as a special welcome into the family.\n\nThis was a situation that feels not quite like choosing sourness when life hands you lemons, but more like life handing you cupcakes and choosing to stomp on them into the ground instead of licking the frosting.", "I don't think it was intended to be something like that. It could have just been a \"kind gesture that didn't go as planned\".\n\nWhen my cousin got married, her fianc\u00e9s female relative (who our side of the family haven't seen before, and who I still have no information about) started to play the guitar to them in the middle of the dinner without informing any one before hand. It was seen as a nice and sweet gesture. So it might have been something similar, just trying to be nice and have some nice music playing.\n\nObviously, it can be some family dynamic thing as well. I just have a hard time seeing it. But op is obviously NTA here as she was told to do that and lead to the piano", "Are you serious?  Obviously she either knew nothing about OP being scheduled to play or the groom's father suggested it, got downvoted, and he had OP play anyway.  The bride obviously didn't handle it well, but she was also under no obligation Miss Mary Sunshine about the surprise piano recital.", "It\u2019s probably as you say, but it\u2019s kind of odd that she was just plonked down at the piano and told to play with no introduction at all. The dad didn\u2019t even call the couple over to listen. It would look to anyone who wasn\u2019t in on it like some random teen just decided to put on a show. But maybe groom\u2019s dad is simply that clueless or he went off to find them but bride got there before he had time to snag her. Could be innocent, but looks peculiar", "Yes, this. My cousin had her fianc\u00e9s female relative play the guitar to her/her fianc\u00e9 during the dinner (our side of the family don't know anything about her other than she is related to the fianc\u00e9).\n\nShe also had her brother attempt (very poorly) to give her a trumpet announcement when she walked down \"the isle\" (we were outdoors in a park so she walked out from behind some bushes on a dirt road lol). It was just intended as some fun and sweet gestures on their big day", "Have you ever been to a wedding where there was a piano just sitting there, nobody using it?", "I read this as\n\n'It's her day, she doesn't need to act like a rational adult.\"", "Sounds like clueless people leading a teen to preform. It would be really weird and pretty rude to just start playing the piano unprompted for no reason no matter how well you play. And that could be what it looked like to the bride and I can understand her being pissed off. I'm pretty willing to go NAH, but things should have been communicated better."]}
