{"id": 23919, "submission_id": "15ip2c8", "title": "AITA for \"stealing the spotlight\" at a wedding?", "selftext": "I (16F) went to a wedding of my parents' friend's son. A bit of background: I've been playing piano my whole life and am frequently asked to play at events. I haven't personally met the groom since I was a baby, and I've never met the bride nor her family until the wedding.\n\nA few days before the wedding, my parents told me I would be performing a piece on the piano during reception. I didn't think anything of it because I had previously played at other weddings several times, so I prepared for it not knowing there was a severe miscommunication coming up.\n\nThe groom's father, who was my family's friend, met me during the reception and guided me to the piano, where I begun to play the piece. I really thought it was totally fine because it seemed the father of the groom had organized the event and coordinated it all with the bride and groom's blessing. However, a bit after I started to play the bride walked up to me, looking very angry and demanded I stop.\n\nShe then blew up at me. She said that it was her wedding and her day and reprimanded me for having the audacity to try to steal the spotlight at her wedding. It became very obvious to me that she was not filled in/informed whatsoever of me playing. I told her I thought I was invited to play, and she said she doesn't even know who I am. The groom's father rushed over and tried to explain, but it was clear I had already upset her on such an important day.\n\nI really feel so bad. The last thing I wanted to do was ruin her big day. The reason I made this post is I really want to reach out to her to apologize, but my family is telling me not to because she was TA for yelling at me. Her words were harsh, but I can understand the frustration because who would want some random girl playing piano at her wedding? AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys for your opinions! It definitely makes me feel less responsible. To be clear, the wedding was paid for almost entirely by the groom's side of the family (according to my parents) which was the impression I was under. I assumed because they paid for it they were the ones arranging it and I guess I wrongly assumed the bride was informed. I do hope to reach out to her, but unfortunately because we're from the groom's side of the acquaintances I don't know how to get her number, and the adults I ask keep telling me to stay out of it. I'm mostly just really embarrassed and was too afraid to defend myself at the moment TT\n\n2nd EDIT: Sorry for not being clear about the music! I was playing during reception. I was told to play ambient music the whole time so I just had some light jazz prepared. It was supposed to be background music to the event and I did not get any sort of crowd. I'm pretty sure people thought I was hired to play (I did not get paid though lol)", "created_utc": 1691220528, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ip2c8/aita_for_stealing_the_spotlight_at_a_wedding/", "score": 934, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not unusual to have live music played at a wedding or for friends/family to do something in honor of the bride/groom.

All I can say is that you just reach out and then you voice out your concerns, you don't apologize you just apologize for the whole misunderstanding but you did nothing wrong you were told and it's not like you could have called the bride and groom beforehand to say thank you for the opportunity and such like that but it is what it is and you shouldn't feel bad you should at least know where to start from and try to see if you can salvage at least a courtesy talk.

But OP and her AH parents were not interested in that, they dd not care about the bride", ">The only way any of this makes sense is if the bride plays piano. And plays it less skillfully than OP\n\nI was wondering if the bride herself played the piano and was going to do a surprise serenade to the groom. And if she is less skillful than OP then that could have made her feel very inadequate and not want to do her surprise at all.\n\nThat could also be part of the miscommunication. If she told FIL that SHE was going to play the piano, but he misunderstood and thought she just wanted ANYONE to play, that could explain why he got Op to play.", "How many weddings have security?  I got married at a very nice venu and we definitely didn't have any.", "Unless it's cordoned off or it's otherwise sectioned off it's reasonable for anyone who feels like it to play it.", "The main point was, the bride could have checked with the groom first to make certain whether that kid is supposed to be playing the piano or not, especially considering the groom's side paid for most of the wedding.\n\n\"Babe, did you hire a pianist to play for us?\" See, simple. It would have saved her a great deal of stress & embarrassment if she had just checked with the groom first.", "No, your lack of understanding of basic etiquette doesn't make you correct. A lack of physical barrier does not make something a free for all for touching.", ">No, your lack of understanding of basic etiquette doesn't make you correct. A lack of physical barrier does not make something a free for all for touching.\n\nBasic etiquette is a subjective term and concept.  The fact that pianos in public are cordoned off with clear signage shows that it's reasonably foreseeable for the public to use them in a public space without the signage and rope off.  That basis for that are liability laws and cases which judge what is a reasonably foreseeable use.", "It is ok that you like AHs in your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter all, the people we surround us with are a mirror of ourself.", "you are deluded", ">It is ok that you like AHs in your life.\n\nLOL.  Since I'm not particularly fragile and weak I don't have AH in my life.  \n\n>After all, the people we surround us with are a mirror of ourself.\n\nSo you're no one.  LOL.", "Yes they did care and they're not AHs. If anything, it was on the groom's dad to ask the bride what she wanted instead of \"surprising\" her. If anyone's an asshole it's him. Where's your judgement for him?\n\nSure, maybe OP and her parents could, (in theory) have thought to ask the bride themselves but we can't all think of everything at any given time and that doesn't make us AHs. OP doesn't even know the married couple, just the groom's parents, and I think it's entirely reasonable that she took the dad at his word. I'm sure next time she'll know to ask directly instead of taking second hand info as read, but some things we can only learn by trial and error. It's easy to look at the situation with the benefit of hindsight and think \"Well, I'd have done this\", and maybe you personally would have acted differently, but you're not OP and what seems obvious to you might not seem obvious to someone else. Everyone has different thought processes! I don't know how old you are, but OP is 16 and just on the cusp of young adulthood so she might not have as much life experience as you. Calling her an AH for an innocent mistake does come across as pretty arrogant and self righteous!\n\nI do hope if you ever make a mistake (as all human beings do), you're treated with more kindness and understanding than you're showing OP.", "Try reading the post. OP didn\u2019t crash the wedding. She was told she would be playing piano there.", "OP playing piano didn\u2019t ruin anything. If the day was ruined it was because of the bride choosing to cause a scene."]}
