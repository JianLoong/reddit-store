The property is very large and rural, it's still a mess but we have animals including horses and some other things. It's a lot of work and a money pit too.\n\nIn 2021, my dad and stepmom asked if my then-16yo twin half-sisters, Beth and Anna could come visit with us. I stressed that it would need to be a working vacation, I didn't have time to be a chauffeur but would welcome the extra set of hands. Anna didn't really enjoy it which is fine but Beth did. \n\nNow we're at 2023. Beth and Anna are now 18 and graduated high school in May 2023 and start college in the US in fall. Beth asked if she could come stay with us for all of July. We said yes and my dad/stepmom agreed though they didn't seem that happy in hindsight. She's been here for two weeks and it's been great. She helps out with the kids and other projects, and I can see her and my mom starting to bond.\n\n She came to us two days ago with a little powerpoint and said she wanted to do a gap year, staying here with us for a year and deferring her admission until next year. She'd worked out the legal/academic/etc logistics and it was very doable. We said sure, we can't pay above min wage but happy to have you. She enthusiastically agreed.\n\nMy dad and stepmom are very upset because apparently Beth pitched the same thing to them the day before and they said absolutely not. I told him he should have warned me but truthfully I don't know if I would have responded any different if he had, she's an adult. He and my stepmom are concerned that she'll just not go to college in 2024, which honestly given her personality I can see as a concern, she doesn't seem that interested or excited about it. I think secretly they also don't like the idea of her having an entire year with my mom+stepdad (they're on civil terms but certainly not friends). She's probably smart enough not to gush to her parents about how much she's bonding with my dad's ex-wife specifically, but I don't know. They are probably also secretly worried she won't come back. \n\nMy dad also said that if she's going to take a gap year she should be building connections not working for her sister for min wage, which I understand. He accused me of taking advantage of cheap labor, even though this was her idea not ours, it caught us very off-guard. I'm in favor of her doing what she wants and clearly this is what she wants, but I can't pretend like this doesn't benefit us to have another set of hands to help with the property and the kids (I'm also pregnant though no one knows yet).", "created_utc": 1689109784, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x3m37/aita_for_letting_my_29_teenage_halfsister_18_stay/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is a legal adult and can do what she wants with her life. An 18 year old with little work experience isn't worth much in the job market, so I wouldn't say you are taking advantage of cheap labor, especially since I'm assuming she is also getting room, board, and food. You sound like a really good sister and it is really cool that you all get to bond with your mom during this time.", "You're both adults.\n\nNTA", "I see NAH. Each of you wants what they want, and some of these priorities clash, but no one is being abusive, threatens with horrible repercussions, or throws toxic fits. Beth will do what Beth will do. You can help her and benefit from it, or she will find another similar situation. Her parents will be upset but, it seems, will eventually get over it. It's all good.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is an adult, and the reality is that what she chooses to do with her life, and her time from here on out is completely up to her. I can understand why your parents may not like her choices, but the reality is that it's still her choice to make whether they like it or not.", "NTA.  Beth is going to go through with her own plans whether it's working for you or something in the US. \n\nTaking a gap year is not a bad idea for some students.  If she's not ready for college, she'll just drop out her first year.  \n\nWhat connections does your dad think an 18 year old with barely any job skills is going to make? She'll just be in a minimum wage service job in the US.\n\nIf Beth enjoys farm life, she might make a career out of it one day whether its animal husbandry,  vet tech, horticulturist,  or something else related.  Better on a resume to show a year of physical hard labor, learning a variety of tasks on a working farm vs. punching buttons on a cash register or flipping burgers.  Tell that to your dad. Or rather have Beth do another power point presentation.  \n\nShe's 18 and will do what she wants.  \n\nCongrats on the pregnancy!", "NTA she is old enough to make her own decisions tbh working on a farm with animals can be very therapeutic and hard work will always have rewards she is learning responsibility and helping others which is great at that age well done for accepting her and I hope she enjoys her stay", ">He accused me of taking advantage of cheap labor\n\nAaaand that's what makes it NTA.\n\nI was honestly leaning for most of this towards N-A-H.  Standard parental concern for their kid etc, but no, your Dad had to go there.\n\nThey're going to see you as enabling her making a bad decision and are probably kicking off because of that (seen similar in my family.)  But really, if they want to play this out, they play it out with Beth.\n\nYou're absolutely clear to give your Dad a piece of your mind though (not that you need anyone's permission.)  Just because he's your Dad doesn't give him fifth freedom to throw that kind of ridiculous unnecessary shade.", "NTA - she\u2019s an adult, and it sounds like she\u2019s very happy being a part of your family, and in terms she requested.  \n\nIf they have concerns, they can talk to her about it.", "NTA.  Beth is an adult and can make her own choices.  You are not taking advantage if you are paying minimum wage.  Her relationship with her father and mother is not your problem.  Beth should do what Beth wants to do.", "NTA - Omg I wish I didn\u2019t go to university right away because I ended up going at 18, dropping out after 2 years, and then going back at 25. Some people really benefit from experiencing life first! \n\nI can understand your parents concern because it\u2019s easy to get stuck in a shit job and lose ambition, but if your half sis uses that time to travel, make connections, live life, maybe do a couple of internships/apprenticeships- she would end up with a better focus going into college. Also big bonus about taking some time off before college is she\u2019ll get all the partying out of her system and will focus more on studies.", "NAH.  Your dad is allowed to be upset and concerned and etc, and Beth is still allowed to decide to stay anyway.  His opinion has become something that Beth can *consider* when making decisions, and hopefully they have a strong relationship and she will continue consulting him into adulthood, but she gets the final say going forward.", "NTA.  Beth is of age and can make her own decisions.  I get where your dad and stepmom want her to go to college, but if she's not inclined then that might also be a big mistake.  It's a tough one, for sure, but think that Beth's desires need to be heard and respected.  It's not like she is loafing around doing nothing, she's enjoying the experience of where you live and also enjoying living with you.  It is nice that you have this time to bond as I assume you've lived apart most of her life.

Having a higher education does not mean you are garanteed a happier , healthier , or more prosperous life. It is unfair of beths parents to not respect her independance.", "NTA\n\nshe is testing the waters and choosing her own path. yell college is good for longterm financial stability and i think you should emphasize that, but this is a great arwa for her to learn about responsibility and working", "I think it's also important to point out that Beth knows what kind of work she'll be doing, and really went above and beyond with the presentation.

That actually means that she's thought about it, so she's made a plan. Her parents should be happy she's making plans for her future. I do think you should make her stick to the year plan and not let her dismiss college. I went to community college and worked full time while finishing my degree a lot of courses were online. Have her enroll into online courses to see how she does, not everyone is cut out for college, my husband attended a technical school. There aren't enough people to do hands on jobs, her future could be beautiful if she chose that route.", "NTA.  Your sister sounds like she has a good plan for her gap year.

Sorry I'm that person :)", "Everyone can insist until the cows come home that 18 is an adult but for a lot of upbringings, it really isn\u2019t.  This is why the fact that she wants a gap year (and maybe more) is probably a good thing for her and she will be with family who will both let her grow up and watch out for her.  In reality, she might not go to college the next year or ever.  18 is still very young.  She has plenty of time to make non-traditional choices or even stupid choices\u2026 and the benefit is that she is with FAMILY who will look out for her.  Not all kids follow traditional paths.  Not only are you not doing anything wrong, you are providing a safe environment for her to test out her wings.  NTA.", "NTA. Not only is she an adult and is able to choose what she wants to do with her life but college is not for everyone.", "u/SlowCold3751 It's also really shitty of Beth's parents to push her into getting a degree / tens of thousands in debt when she's not interested in school. My mom pushed me to go to school then bullied me out of nursing into engineering. 8yrs of going to school on and off later and I've got an associates of business from a community college I finished last summer ($22k), plus $10k in debt from 2 failed terms at a university.\n\nI just dropped out for good and it vastly improved my mental health. I already make good money and am working towards moving overseas with my current job. I climbed my way up to $50k+/yr with no degree, she can too whether it's an office job or trade school without being saddled with debt from the US school system.", "Okay, cool. Good to know!", "NTA\n\nShe's an adult. It's her choice. And if she really doesn't seem interested in college, talk to her about alternative routes like certification or trade programs.

The dad didn't know Beth would be doing the same as her sister. Even if he did know I doubt he would think you would be making such decisions without consulting him first.....you aren't her parent.\n\nI think you were too happy with the idea of additional help that you didn't really think about anyone else that might factor into the situation. Beth is an adult and can do what she wants but at the end of the day her parents are probably going to have to financially support/help her while she does college. Her dad made good points about networking and stuff.\n\nBeth can do what she wants but you were wrong in how you handle the situation. Ask Beth if she would consider taking online classes while living and working for you. It doesn't have to be a lot of classes maybe one or two each semester. That way she can have credits to go towards her degree when she get serious about it in a year.", "NTA OP.\n\nMy son is just finishing up a 2 year long \"gap year\".  He was burnt out, and needed a break from school.  Now that he has worked 2 years, he is thoroughly sick of his job and is looking forward to school.    \nMost children have a mind of their own, and can work out their own schedules on when to work / when to go to school.\n\nIf you let them blaze their own path, there is less familial strife.", "Nta I fully encourage \u201cgap years\u201d for teenagers I remember being that age and having no clue what I wanted a career in (uk leaves school at 16) I took a Mechanics course for a year until I figured out what I wanted to do got to say I\u2019ve probably saved myself \u00a31000s over the years doing my own car maintenance if she can put her gap year experience towards something useful that\u2019s all the better", "College isn't for everyone, it's good she has something else to turn to and she did. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI'd suggest sitting down with Beth and looking into some online courses so she can get something more tangible out of her gap year.\n\nFor example, getting her to learn the local language (if there is one), looking into open university-type courses, programming and coding options, etc. \n\nIt might also be worthwhile to look into getting her high school education validated in your new country and looking for a university degree there and gaining competence in intercultural communicative (whatever the language difference may be). \n\nThere are other ways of spinning her gap year to make it sound like she's preparing for future goals rather than working on her big sister's property (not that that's a bad thing)."]}
