{"id": 21981, "submission_id": "14x3m37", "title": "AITA for letting my [29] teenage half-sister [18] stay with me, against our dad's wishes?", "selftext": "Back in 2020, my husband and I relocated from the US to his native country with our kids \\[now 6, 3, and 1.5\\], along with my mom and stepdad. The property is very large and rural, it's still a mess but we have animals including horses and some other things. It's a lot of work and a money pit too.\n\nIn 2021, my dad and stepmom asked if my then-16yo twin half-sisters, Beth and Anna could come visit with us. I stressed that it would need to be a working vacation, I didn't have time to be a chauffeur but would welcome the extra set of hands. Anna didn't really enjoy it which is fine but Beth did. \n\nNow we're at 2023. Beth and Anna are now 18 and graduated high school in May 2023 and start college in the US in fall. Beth asked if she could come stay with us for all of July. We said yes and my dad/stepmom agreed though they didn't seem that happy in hindsight. She's been here for two weeks and it's been great. She helps out with the kids and other projects, and I can see her and my mom starting to bond.\n\n She came to us two days ago with a little powerpoint and said she wanted to do a gap year, staying here with us for a year and deferring her admission until next year. She'd worked out the legal/academic/etc logistics and it was very doable. We said sure, we can't pay above min wage but happy to have you. She enthusiastically agreed.\n\nMy dad and stepmom are very upset because apparently Beth pitched the same thing to them the day before and they said absolutely not. I told him he should have warned me but truthfully I don't know if I would have responded any different if he had, she's an adult. He and my stepmom are concerned that she'll just not go to college in 2024, which honestly given her personality I can see as a concern, she doesn't seem that interested or excited about it. I think secretly they also don't like the idea of her having an entire year with my mom+stepdad (they're on civil terms but certainly not friends). She's probably smart enough not to gush to her parents about how much she's bonding with my dad's ex-wife specifically, but I don't know. They are probably also secretly worried she won't come back. \n\nMy dad also said that if she's going to take a gap year she should be building connections not working for her sister for min wage, which I understand. He accused me of taking advantage of cheap labor, even though this was her idea not ours, it caught us very off-guard. I'm in favor of her doing what she wants and clearly this is what she wants, but I can't pretend like this doesn't benefit us to have another set of hands to help with the property and the kids (I'm also pregnant though no one knows yet).", "created_utc": 1689109784, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14x3m37/aita_for_letting_my_29_teenage_halfsister_18_stay/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is a legal adult and can do what she wants with her life. An 18 with little work experience isn't worth much in the job market, so I wouldn't say you are taking advantage of cheap labor, especially since I'm assuming she is also getting room, board, and food. You sound like a really good sister and it is really cool that you all get to bond with your mom during this time.", "You're both adults.\n\nNTA", "I see NAH. Each of you wants what they want, and some of these priorities clash, but no one is being abusive, threatens with horrible repercussions, or throws toxic fits. Beth will do what Beth will do. You can help her and benefit from it, or she will find another similar situation. Her parents will be upset but, it seems, will eventually get over it. It's all good.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is an adult, and the reality is that what she chooses to do with her life, and her time from here on out is completely up to her. I can understand why your parents may not like her choices, but the reality is that it's still her choice to make whether they like it or not.", "NTA.  Beth is going to go through with her own plans whether it's working for you or something in the US. \n\nTaking a gap year is not a bad idea for some students.  If she's not ready for college, she'll just drop out her first year.  \n\nWhat connections does your dad think an 18 year old with barely any job skills is going to make? She'll just be in a minimum wage service job in the US.\n\nIf Beth enjoys farm life, she might make a career out of it one day whether its animal husbandry,  vet tech, horticulturist,  or something else related.  Better on a resume to show a year of physical hard labor, learning a variety of tasks on a working farm vs. punching buttons on a cash register or flipping burgers.  Tell that to your dad. Or rather have Beth do another power point presentation.  \n\nShe's 18 and will do what she wants.  \n\nCongrats on the pregnancy!", "NTA she is old enough to make her own decisions tbh working on a farm with animals can be very therapeutic and hard work will always have rewards she is learning responsibility and helping others which is great at that age well done for accepting her and I hope she enjoys her stay", ">He accused me of taking advantage of cheap labor\n\nAaaand that's what makes it NTA.\n\nI was honestly leaning for most of this towards N-A-H.  Standard parental concern for their kid etc, but no, your Dad had to go there.\n\nThey're going to see you as enabling her making a bad decision and are probably kicking off because of that (seen similar in my family.)  But really, if they want to play this out, they play it out with Beth.\n\nYou're absolutely clear to give your Dad a piece of your mind though (not that you need anyone's permission.)  Just because he's your Dad doesn't give him fifth freedom to throw that kind of ridiculous unnecessary shade.", "NTA - she\u2019s an adult, and it sounds like she\u2019s very happy being a part of your family, and in terms she requested.  \n\nIf they have concerns, they can talk to her about it.", "NTA.  Beth is an adult and can make her own choices.  You are not taking advantage if you are paying minimum wage.  Her relationship with her father and mother is not your problem.  Beth should do what Beth wants to do.", "NTA - Omg I wish I didn\u2019t go to university right away because I ended up going at 18, dropping out after 2 years, and then going back at 25. Some people really benefit from experiencing life first! \n\nI can understand your parents concern because it\u2019s easy to get stuck in a shit job and lose ambition, but if your half sis uses that time to travel, make connections, live life, maybe do a couple of internships/apprenticeships- she would end up with a better focus going into college. Also big bonus about taking some time off before college is she\u2019ll get all the partying out of her system and will focus more on studies.", "NAH.  Your dad is allowed to be upset and concerned and etc, and Beth is still allowed to decide to stay anyway.  His opinion has become something that Beth can *consider* when making decisions, and hopefully they have a strong relationship and she will continue consulting him into adulthood, but she gets the final say going forward.", "NTA.  Beth is of age and can make her own decisions.  I get where your dad and stepmom want her to go to college, but if she's not inclined then that might also be a big mistake.  It's a tough one, for sure, but think that Beth's desires need to be heard and respected.  It's not like she is loafing around doing nothing, she's enjoying the experience of where you live and also enjoying living with you.  It is nice that you have this time to bond as I assume you've lived apart most of her life.  Hope the year goes well for all of you.", "NTA your sister is adult.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
