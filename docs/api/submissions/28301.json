I honestly don\u2019t know even where to start, this whole situation has left me feeling embarrassed and frustrated. My husband(27) and I(26) have been together for 7 years and married for 3. Long story short, my MIL has always hated me and always made harsh statements about my appearance. I always brushed it off and gave a simple nod to her comments never trying to give her the reaction she wants. For the past couple of weeks my MIL has been making remarks about my daughter\u2019s appearance and how she doesn\u2019t resemble my husband(for context, i\u2019m hispanic and my husband is white). Ive tried explaining how genetics work and it always ends up with her acussing me of sleeping around.\n\nThis has made me completely upset and i\u2019ve tried speaking to my husband about it for him to simply brush it off and say he\u2019ll talk to her about it. This all came to ahead, when my husband told me to get dressed since we were going to this restaurant that I love. I was very excited since we haven\u2019t went on any dates since my daughter was born 10 months ago.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant , they seated us at a table for 4, i found it strange but never thought much into it. Not even 15 minutes later, my MIL and FIL came. I was hoping they were going to sit somewhere else , but as luck would have it they sat with us. Before we could share greeting with each other, my mil went on a huge rant about my daughter and how i\u2019m forcing my husband to raise another man\u2019s child. She said she won\u2019t allow her son to raise someone else\u2019s garbage baby and how she wants a paternity test done. I turned to my husband thinking he\u2019ll defend me but he held his head low and said he agrees with his mother. I was in complete utter shock since my husband has never mentioned having any doubts of our daughter being his, if he would have voiced his concern i would have 100% did the test to restaure his worries. Without saying anything i got up and walked right out the restaurant.\n\nMy husband didn\u2019t even try to go after me, he just saw me leave. I ended picking up my daughter from my parents house  and heading home. Not even an hour later my husband comes home yelling at me for embarrassing him at the restaurant and how could I be so selfish to embarrass his mother. I tried telling him the fact he thinks our daughter isn\u2019t his , hurts badly and he just scoffed. We ended up getting into a bad argument causing me to pack my stuff(and my babies stuff) to stay with my parents. His family and friends have been blowing up my phone calling me a dirty stank and so much more. the only person who\u2019s on my side is my FIL. I spoke to my friend about it and she said I was the asshole for leaving the restaurant without explaining myself and how i owe them an apology. \n\nNow i\u2019m conflicted on this  if i really am the asshole for. i\u2019m honestly confused because my husband had 10 months to voice his concern and speak to me about it maturely instead of involving his mother.", "created_utc": 1696549005, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/170x423/aita_for_walking_out_of_a_restaurant_after_my_mil/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Give him the paternity test with a side of divorce papers. If he caves to him mom over this, proving paternity won\u2019t fix anything. Imagine what will happen if you MIL ever wants something in the future, or disagrees with a parenting choice! Your husband has shown that he doesn\u2019t trust you and will bend to his mommy\u2019s will over absolutely anything. This man will not defend you- he will not support you and he will not be an equal partner. Your marriage officially had three people in it. Is that how you want to raise a kid?\n\n\nETA: if you choose to divorce, I\u2019d recommend asking for full custody so your child isn\u2019t exposed to your MIL. She will surely badmouth you every chance she gets. I\u2019d also recommend only communicating with your husband (ex) through a co-parenting app- document the crap out of his behavior now and forever, because you may need to prove that his family is too toxic for your child to be around.", "Like, holy CRAPTASTIC Batman, so much NTA here. You owe NO ONE an apology in this situation - they came into the restaurant and ambushed you with that spurious insult to your character. Your husband, who is supposed to love & support you, threw you to the wolves, and did absolutely nothing to support you.\n\n1. stay with your parents, hire yourself the best lawyer you possibly can afford (the sharkier the better)\n2. get that paternity test done. Once it is proven that he is indeed the father, move on to step 3\n3. divorce him, sue for 100% custody and child support and take him for everything that you possibly can\n4. block that racist you married, along with his mother,  and the rest of the flying monkeys\n5. enjoy being the mother of a beautiful baby girl that you obviously love very much.\n\n(obviously a lot of this is my anger on your behalf talking, but there is no way in any universe that you are the AH in this scenario.

Your father in law is correct.\n\nAnd so are you. If I understand you correctly, you would not have acted as you did had your husband raised the issue in the same location without his parents present.\n\nThe most generous interpretation I can give to your husband's conduct is that he cannot distinguish between his views and his mother's history of unacceptable conduct. Your friend is 100% wrong. Your husband is 100% wrong for believing that it was unjustified for you to embarrass his mother. In fact I think what you did was quite classy to avoid causing a scene in front of her husband.", "Don\u2019t listen to your \u2019friend\u2019. She\u2019s not really your friend. Unbelievable situation! You have a MIL and a husband problem. I would have the paternity tests done to silence the critics but this would be irreconcilable for me. The relationship between me and my husband would be irrevocably changed and over.", "NTA,\n\nWhy did you have a baby with this horrible man??? Poor child!! She\u2019s labeled garbage by his family! And he agrees. This is awful. \n\nGet the dna test, sort this crap out, and honestly leave this man and get child support. This is really the end of a marriage and I hope you protect your child.", "NTA - talk to an attorney - have them schedule the paternity test and begin the division of assets and determine the appropriate child support and if appropriate, spousal support payments. \n\nThen settle the divorce from this @$$hole and his family.", "I would get the paternity test just to shut him and his mom up. When you get the results, invite your in-laws over to reveal the results. Along with the results, serve your husband with divorce papers. \n\nHe let his mother disrespect you and he didn\u2019t stick up for you to his mother. He is as bad if not worse than your MIL. \n\nOf course, this is what I would do. You must make up your own mind. Can you live with her disrespect as well as the disrespect from your husband. Only you can decide if this is what you want.", "NTA\n\n*You* embarrassed *them* when you walked out of the restaurant **after** they publicly accused you of cheating?

Life is too short to live like this.", "Whew the things I want to say would get me banned from this sub. \nThere was another post like this a few weeks ago and the mother knew the baby was her husbands but she was over him letting the MIL trample all over her and realized if it wasn\u2019t the paternity test there would always be something his mother would try to burn her at the stake for.\n\nSo she got the paternity test done and when the results came in she gave it to him along with divorce papers. She saved texts and all evidence of the MIL intruding in the marriage and took his butt to court and also made sure the MIL would never be around her kid again. \n\nOP I suggest you do the same, you are not married to a man. You are married to an extension of your MIL and she will never change therefore he will never grow a spine and support you like a true partner would and should.\n\nI can\u2019t even imagine the pain you must be feeling but it can get better when you decide to stop accepting less than what you deserve.\n\nNTA\n\nEdited to fix formatting and spelling*", "NTA.  \n\nThis would end a marriage for me-- I would file for divorce, get the paternity test through the court, and go after this limp weasel for everything, including child support, spousal support, and the family home.

Your MiL is toxic, your husband is barely any better.", "NTA - the FIRST STEP is to make an appointment with a divorce lawyer to understand your options.  Do not get a paternity test, etc until you fully understand your options and what you want to do.\n\nThen you need to think about your options.  If you get the paternity test, your husband and MIL will want to sweep this all under the rug.  There will be no apologies, etc. from the, because your MIL feels completely justified in what she has done and your husband does her bidding.  You don\u2019t have a marriage because he will not put you first ever.  His mother\u2019s needs are first.  They planned this whole nice dinner to convince you to get a paternity test.  You did the right thing by leaving.  \n\nYour friend is wrong, and you need to never listen to that friends advice again.  MIL has accused you of adultery without any proof and your husband is going along with what his mommy wants.  Once the paternity is settled, it will be something else.\n\nShould you choose to divorce him, you need to let go of being fair to your husband.  He allowed his mother to destroy your marriage.", "NTA- do a paternity test, take him to court for child support and leave his sorry a$$.", "NTA get the test done and when the results come back tell your hubby that you want a divorce, use the results of the test in court to make him pay child support", "NTA, hand him the paternity test results along with a set of divorce papers.", "NTA.

This relationship is doomed, get a divorce lawyer now.", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe anyone an apology.\n\nLeave your husband and sue him for child support.  Both you and your daughter will be better off being far away from this toxic and quite frankly stupid family (FIL excepted).", "Welp, time for a divorce!   \n\n\nIn case this isn't fake, which it kinda seems like it is, NTA and seriously - SERIOUSLY - divorce lawyer up. ASAP.", "Info- did your husband explain why he thought the kid may not have been his?  10 months in and suddenly his mother convinced him?  What gives?\n\nNTA, even if your husband did question paternity, the way he allowed this to unfold is pretty effed up.", "NTA.

Throw that asshole out. He conspired with his mother to ambush you in public. Embarrassment is the least that the three of them deserved. NTA.", "NTA. Absolutely not. You owe none of these terrible people an apology. I would take the paternity test and deliver it with the divorce papers.", "NTA. Give him that DNA test and use it to sue him for child support, because you deserve someone that will stand up for you.", "NTA. Wow. You have a MIL problem and husband problem. I would seriously consider divorce because husband is not standing up for you and is essentially saying that he believes you cheated on him. You can have a paternity test done as part of the divorce proceedings. I am so sorry that this is happening to you. I hope that you find someone who is loving and supportive of you.", "NTA.  Step 1 I would do the paternity test (even though you know it isn\u2019t necessary).  Step 2 is your MIL is banned from any contact with you and your child.  Her toxic behaviour is not acceptable and you and your child should never be in a position where you are ever subject to it ever again. Step 3 is deciding your next step with a husband who did not support you.  This is the toughest one as he has mistrusted you for no reason.", "NTA. Your husband's family sucks ass. Do a paternity test and give him divorce papers. He won't stick up for you with his mother. He yelled at you for 'embarrassing his mother' when he should've stood by you instead.", "NTA, absolutely.\n\nDon't even think of apologizing to those horrible AHs of inlaws and your husband.\n\nIf you can afford the divorce, do the test, toss it at him and file for divorce.", "NTA\n\nYou're in an unhealthy situation.  I'm so sorry.  \n\nStay with your parents until your husband, his family, and his friends start to treat you with respect.  I wish you the best.", "NTA. You were fully justified in leaving, you were being subjected to extreme emotional abuse. Do the test and then leave your husband. His behavior, and his mom\u2019s are unforgivable. You deserve better OP.", "NTA. I\u2019d be delivering divorce papers with that paternity test though. How hard and for how long do you want to be treated this way? Not just by your MIL, but by your husband. Can you allow your daughter to be criticized by her grandmother the same way you are? Will her father even defend her, or will he just sit back while his mother abuses your kid? This isn\u2019t a thing that gets better. He won\u2019t change. His mother won\u2019t all of a sudden have a change of heart.", "No way.  NTA at all.  Get that paternity test, and a divorce.  Make sure in custody you do whatever you have to in order to block MIL from being near or having any contact with your child.  If you have texts of her abuse give them to the lawyer to prove her hostility, and how she behaves with your daughter.  From here on out only communicate through texts or recorded conversation with the hopefully soon  to be ex husband.  Make sure your lawyer has copies of it all.  Supervised visitation with baby until custody is established.", "NTA. You were bushwhacked. And your husband helped with it and did not defend you. So he either believes you cheated on him or is siding with his unhinged mother over you to appease her. You owe no one an apology. You are the injured party here. If it were me I would tell my husband you arent coming home until he apologizes. Also, he must agree that you are both NC with MIL until SHE apologizes. FIL can visit since he seems to have some common sense. \n\nGood luck to all of you. Sounds like you will need it.", "NTA!  If it was me I would get the paternity test and when the results are back showing it's his child I would hand him divorce papers as well.  He has basically accused you of being a cheater.   You know the truth.  Once he sees the results he will know he f\\*\\*ked up.  He will always take his mom's side and you don't need to live with that.  I would also never allow MIL or that family around your child.", "He will never take your side. He agreed with his mom about the test.  Get out and hire a lawyer.", "NTA OMG apologize for not causing a scene?  You seem to have stood up and walked out.  Your husband set you up to be ambushed about a DNA test!  This is a huge red flag regarding your future.  Your poor child!", "I'm not usually one to say something so drastic like this, but you need to divorce his ass. Your husband and his family are racist trash Gremlins. Fuck the test and fuck them.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nHoly crap. You have a husband AND MiL problem. Hopefully a soon to be ex problem, because unfortunately I don\u2019t know if you could come back to that. \n\n1. Lawyer. Now. WHY would you want to stay with someone who lets their mother refer to YOUR child as garbage? Who lets them talk to YOU like that? No. Sue for custody. For right of first refusal. Document everything she has ever called you and how racist she is and use it to mandate that she cannot see your child if you can. \n\n2. Paternity test - prove to that spineless cretin and his mother that he has ruined the two best things in his life. Let him come crawling back, begging and kissing the very ground you walk on, and shut the door on him. He\u2019s not allowed to hurt you like that. \n\n3. No phone calls. No meeting in person. Everything written. Co-parenting can be done via an app. \n\n4. Never speak to MIL ever again. If FIL understands the severity of this I could see you allowing visitation nowhere near MIL. \n\n5. Anyone who sides with your husband and MIL doesn\u2019t deserve to be in your life. They can exit stage left. \n\nTake him everything for everything you are owed. Every time he \u201cwould talk to her\u201d rather than shutting her down. Blindsiding you at the restaurant? Every tear you\u2019ve shed over this. Every ounce of anger. All of that? Rip it out of his hide.", "NTA you are valid. seems like your MIL has a vendetta toward you for some reason and your husband is doing you dirty by not standing up for you.", "NTA X 100 billion gazillion traqifhhdtillon.", "NTA. Get the test to prove you didn't step out on your husband, post it on social media to put MIL on blast, then divorce him. Your MIL is seriously racist: this almost certainly underlies why she doesn't believe you, but you have even more of a husband problem than an MIL problem. If he won't defend you, time to call off the marriage.", "You have a husband problem. He has no respect for you.", "Nta.

You didn\u2019t even have an issue with doing a paternity test, you just didn\u2019t like how they went about demanding it. You have been fair and rational with people who are irrational.

I honestly don\u2019t know even where to start, this whole situation has left me feeling embarrassed and frustrated. My husband(27) and I(26) have been together for 7 years and married for 3. Long story short, my MIL has always hated me and always made harsh statements about my appearance. I always brushed it off and gave a simple nod to her comments never trying to give her the reaction she wants. For the past couple of weeks my MIL has been making remarks about my daughter\u2019s appearance and how she doesn\u2019t resemble my husband(for context, i\u2019m hispanic and my husband is white). Ive tried explaining how genetics work and it always ends up with her acussing me of sleeping around.\n\nThis has made me completely upset and i\u2019ve tried speaking to my husband about it for him to simply brush it off and say he\u2019ll talk to her about it. This all came to ahead, when my husband told me to get dressed since we were going to this restaurant that I love. I was very excited since we haven\u2019t went on any dates since my daughter was born 10 months ago.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant , they seated us at a table for 4, i found it strange but never thought much into it. Not even 15 minutes later, my MIL and FIL came. I was hoping they were going to sit somewhere else , but as luck would have it they sat with us. Before we could share greeting with each other, my mil went on a huge rant about my daughter and how i\u2019m forcing my husband to raise another man\u2019s child. She said she won\u2019t allow her son to raise someone else\u2019s garbage baby and how she wants a paternity test done. I turned to my husband thinking he\u2019ll defend me but he held his head low and said he agrees with his mother. I was in complete utter shock since my husband has never mentioned having any doubts of our daughter being his, if he would have voiced his concern i would have 100% did the test to restaure his worries. Without saying anything i got up and walked right out the restaurant.\n\nMy husband didn\u2019t even try to go after me, he just saw me leave. I ended picking up my daughter from my parents house  and heading home. Not even an hour later my husband comes home yelling at me for embarrassing him at the restaurant and how could I be so selfish to embarrass his mother. I tried telling him the fact he thinks our daughter isn\u2019t his , hurts badly and he just scoffed. We ended up getting into a bad argument causing me to pack my stuff(and my babies stuff) to stay with my parents. His family and friends have been blowing up my phone calling me a dirty stank and so much more. the only person who\u2019s on my side is my FIL. I spoke to my friend about it and she said I was the asshole for leaving the restaurant without explaining myself and how i owe them an apology. \n\nNow i\u2019m conflicted on this  if i really am the asshole for. i\u2019m honestly confused because my husband had 10 months to voice his concern and speak to me about it maturely instead of involving his mother.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Cut these people out and your trash husband too!", "He probably wouldn't have anything to do with the child if the paternity test came back as saying they weren't his.\n\nBut yeah, send him back to the number one woman in his life: his mother.", "Get the DNA test and when the results come out proving it\u2019s his child serve him with a divorce. No matter what happens your MIL will always interfere and cause havoc in your marriage, especially because your husband is a doormat to her. You and your child deserve better. I wish you all the best, can\u2019t imagine how heartbreaking this would be. Also, find a new friend\u2026", "Then a) how could you possibly think you have any blame in this and b) get away from that toxic wasteland family, including your husband, with your lovely daughter and never look back. Also your \u2018friend\u2019 is a full-bore enemy.", "This sounds cruel, but it is reality. Your hub will let his momma keep trash talking you until she convinces him to leave you. Don't give him that chance.", "My FIL has defended me countless times but my MIL would always start screaming at him how i turned him against her", "Op is missing an important note from a comment- her husband cheated *on her* during their first year of marriage, so he's probably projecting his cheating on her, to make him justified or to not feel bad about his own damn cheating.", "Deep down, I know my MIL will spit venom at my daughter at every chance she gets", "I honestly forced myself to believe that his mothers behavior was 100% acceptable and how i was the asshole for it but as i\u2019m reading comments i\u2019m realizing that i\u2019m not", "The only thing I keep finding odd is that OP doesn't sound like she would have been offended or upset if the husband has voiced concern and requested a paternity test. Is there a reason for that? I wouldn't think that is a reasonable request to make of someone unless there is a lack of trust.", "There are way too many stories on reddit like this. \nIt's pathetic that your husband did not stand up to his mother and allowed her to ambush you like that in a public place. You reacted very classy by removing yourself from that situation.  This behavior will likely not change. Would you advise your own daughter to tolerate that treatment? \n\nI would take a paternity test, present it alongside divorce papers, and a letter to your MIL stating I hope you're happy that your flesh and bones will grow up in two households. \nMaybe keep a line open with your FIL so your daughter has at least one nice grandparent from that side. \n\nI'd be willing to bet MIL has problems with your race. You and your daughter deserve better.", "Remove your daughter from this situation. Divorce. \n\nGet the paternity test to make him step up legally as the father and petition for majority custody based on how his family denies her and their behaviour and comments to her (write down everytime they say and do something, with dates and witnesses and keep written correspondance). \n\nThen, as she gets older, monitor their relationship with her to make sure they are not openly resenting her. Adjust custody as necessary.", "You need to get your daughter away from them, they won't change, they are racist assholes.\n\nI would get the paternity test and divorce your husband.", "Get the paternity test to prove them wrong and then divorce this sorry momma\u2019s boy. You deserve better than to be married and raising a child with a man like this. He is too stupid to understand genetics, is whipped by his momma in his ear, let this fester for 10 months and let his parents ambush you in public.", "Take your daughter and run from this whole family, including your hopefully ex husband.", "And you are ok with this? Get away from them", "She is racist and so is your husband.", "I am so sorry, OP.   His mother is hell on wheels. I am so sorry you would ever have thought this was your fault.  In reality, while your husband is in the wrong for not sticking up for you,  he has been brainwashed for a long time. \n\nFor your marriage to work, you need to be around people who support your marriage . Ask your husband if he wants to be married. Separate from the test,  if he wants to be married, he can't let his mom be around any of you.  She will only keep destroying your marriage.", "I do believe fathers have a right to a paternity test if they\u2019re unsure about their child so i wasn\u2019t upset if he wanted one, but it\u2019s the fact his mother got herself involved when it didn\u2019t include her", "I think you actually should be upset if your DH wanted a test. He is essentially accusing you of cheating and doesn't trust you. Then coupled with allowing his mother to disrespect you when he swore an oath to love and protect you above all others. You will never fully forgive him for this, even if you try. Put a fork in your marriage, it's done.", "Why would he be unsure it's his child? I don't think that is a normal feeling unless something happened to cause it. I feel like most people would be offended by the implication. Is there anything missing from the story? Something that happened that caused MIL to act the way she does?", "If my husband had asked for a paternity test, I'd have left him. The lack of trust, combined with the implication that he believes I'd trick him into raising another man's child? We'd never recover from that.", "That's fair, but sometimes anxiety doesn't work that way. Sometimes you just need the evidence. The real move is for the dad to pluck one of the kids hairs and then go do the test himself. Why does she even need to be involved? Accusing her like this achieves absolutely nothing. \n\nEither way, i generally agree with you on this particular case. The trust is gone, time to move on. Letting mommy fight his battles for him is the last straw.", "When we were in our first year of marriage , my husband cheated on me with a coworker but we worked through it together and i\u2019m assuming he thinks i\u2019m getting payback when that is not the case at all. My MIL has always been vicious towards me, for no apparent reason.", "I'm guessing racism.", "Honey, you are NTA.  I don't know how you got so beat down you accept a cheating husband who can't stand up to his mother.\n\nDo better for your daughter.  She doesn't need any part of this mess.  Staple the paternity test results to the divorce papers and don't look back.", "So he is a racist cheater. Ni\u00f1a qui\u00e9rete un poquito! Dont let this family around your baby", "Wow. So HE cheated on YOU and they\u2019re all gaslighting you now? Abusive.", "oh my god the way that man would be DEAD to me??? \n\nthis miserable little mommy\u2019s boy CHEATED on YOU and has the audacity to ask for a paternity test??? the things i really want to say would have me banned from this sub at breakneck speed.\n\nhell just simply isn\u2019t hot enough. \n\nleave this man. you have too much life to live to deal with this for even one more second.", "Is this a joke? So he's a cheater and he's unsure about your fidelity? \n\nDe donde saca el tupe para acusarte de infiel habi\u00e9ndolo sido el? Vos entendes que el te esta acusando no solamente de serle infiel, si no de enga\u00f1arlo respecto a la paternidad de su hija? Falta nada m\u00e1s que digas que el embarazo fue planeado y tenemos cart\u00f3n lleno. \n\nDivorciate hermana, hacete ese favor a vos misma y a tu hija."]}
