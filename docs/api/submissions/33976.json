Then she announced that she had met her bio dad and he would be father of the bride at her wedding and my dad was a regular old guest.\n\nThis happens much too often. \n\nCan we start an organization of volunteers who find weddings where this kind of thing happened and plant an easel at the reception with a big sign saying \"this celebration was brought to you by the generous sponsorship of *they who were wronged*\" with a photo of *they who were wronged* on it?", "Being the chaotic person that I am, I will go to the wedding and make a  suprise speech about her on reception being a terrible daughter and half sister while wishing luck to his future husband. lol", "NTA, but there is something you need to understand, your dad does not see this situation the same way you do.\n\nYes, she is a giant asshole and a user, but I think your dad is fulfilling his duty.  He is there for her, providing, and caring *unconditionally*.  He does not see this as a transactional relationship and, while I am sure on some level he wishes she would give back, it is not necessary to him.  He is fulfilled by being the provider.  If you want to point to one thing that sets a \"real man\" apart--this is it.  Not how much you lift, how well you shoot, how far you run, how many shots you down, how many chick you bang...  it is \"do you provide for your family\"?\n\nYou can advice him, say your piece, make your own decision about going, but I would then let it go.\n\nOne thing I would do while trying to convince him is to ask him why?  One of two things will happen:  He will realize that this is useless and join you or he will fully explain to you why in a way that you will understand.", "NTA.

She already got the money.", "NTA - you can not go, but you need to let your dad to manage his own relationship with her.", "NTA but...\n\nYou can't prevent your dad from trying with Elizabeth. It doesn't sound like she'll ever change, but your dad wants to try. The most you can do is limit your interactions with her. Your mom will have to accept that her kids just aren't close. \n\nAnd as someone with two older half-sisters that never wanted me, I want to wish you the best. Good on you for sticking up for yourself.", "You can't take the rose-coloured glasses off your parents, much as it sucks to watch them invest time and money in an awful person. Your mom sucks for supporting her awful daughter instead of her own husband. That's almost as bad as Elizabeth's behaviour. But while your dad refuses to snap out of it, none of that matters. It's not your fight. Let them waste their money and continue to have nothing to do with it.", "NtA. It\u2019s truly amazing how people will stick with the shitty person so often.", "NTA\n\nIt's a shame your dad has been through this, however, he's decided to accept this.\n\nIf it was me, I'd go, I'd make a speech.  Let all the guests know how happy he is that they attended the wedding he is hosting for his step daughter. Using STEP many times.\n\nIf he chooses not to attend, he should also stop any future payments for the wedding.  The bill sent directly to step daughter. Period.", "NTA\n\nFor starters, it sounds like you never actually got an invitation. That means, regardless of what she told yoyr mother, you aren't actually invited\n\nYour mom needs to stop forcing this.

I get it, kind of embarrassing that she would be without a plus one when people know she is married.  She is also avoiding the questions about you.\n\nYou don't have a relationship with the bride.  No reason to fake it, especially when you are not invited.", "NTA\n\nElizabeth is an AH who makes her own decisions.   You don't have a relationship and, I agree, that you should not go.   There is no reason to want to go to that or any gathering for her.   \n\nAs far as your father, I feel sorry for him.   He keeps wanting a relationship with Elizabeth, but it just never happened.   He has come to understand who Elizabeth is.   That's why he is not phased by her horrible treatment.\n\nYou care about your Dad and don't want to see him hurt anymore.   You are not wrong to care about his emotional and mental health.   At the same time, you have to respect his decisions.   He want to keep trying to form a meaningful relationship with her.\n\nI can sympathize with that.   I have kids.   Parents have the choice to cut them off emotionally or to continue to try to love them.   Your father is choosing to continue in this one sided relationship.   It doesn't mean that he's wrong.   Only he can choose when he wants to stop trying with her.   \n\nMy suggestion is to talk to your dad.   Tell him that you are worried about him and his wellbeing.   Don't make the conversation be about Elizabeth.   Tell him that you love him and that you want the best for him because he has been the best father the he could.   Try to support him because when he finally gives up on Elizabeth, it sounds like it is going to be a huge emotional fallout.\n\nI have to believe that your Mom is kind of a small AH, too.   She has put her head in the sand to ignored these issues for two decades.   She ignored the emotional damage that it caused you and your dad.   Her insisting that you act like everything is fine, ignoring your choices as an eighteen-year-old is kind of telling.   Either she wants to put an outward appearance to others who will be present, or she is telling you that your emotional needs are not as important as her wants.\n\nEither way, be there for your dad.   He sounds like he's been through a lot.  I would maybe suggest talking to a counselor about the issues that Elizabeth has caused you.   If you can, get your Dad and Mom to come.  That session would probably be better.\n\nGood luck, OP.   You are looking out for the ones you care about.   There is never anything wrong with that.", "NTA.

She\u2019s never going to \u201ccome around\u201d unless she wants something from him.

You completly agree with youur view and what you said to your parents. I do not agree with hteir reaction to it. \n\nBut here is the thing. You can not dictate how they should react. \n\nYou told them your experience, you told them what you thought they should to. You did your part.\n\nNow it is on them to decide what they do. And they have to live with that decision.", "NTA, though I doubt the relationship is as one-sidedly negative as you make it out to be. I'm sure it's much more mutual than this post suggests.", "NTA. Your mom needs to stop pretending there is any sisterhood between her daughters. She is hurting all of you this way.", "NTA - But you\u2019re an adult now.

She should be even more mad that her daughter used her husband for money.", "NTA. Not everyone deserves your effort but as for your dad- his relationship with her is for him to manage. \nProbably doesn\u2019t help but im a step mom and it seems like we always get shafted no matter what we do. Kids take their trauma for their parents not working out on us. Easy targets I guess.

She only said of course to mom because of that money.", "No, that\u2019s utter bullshit. My brother and I never took the issues we had with our divorced parents out on our step dad. Because we weren\u2019t allowed to. I don\u2019t get why this shit is allowed and accepted the way it is today if it\u2019s not deserved.", "I get that. I just hate it for him. He has done so much and does go all out to try and make sure she's not missing out because of her deadbeat. I hate seeing him being viewed as just a wallet.

Your dad has probably struggled for a long time with the idea that some attention is better than no attention and could be a little blinded to it all.\n\nHe'll either see it or he won't.  The point here is to do for yourself what you think is best.  You've pointed out that your parents are wearing rose colored glasses.  You can't make them take them off.", "I understand. It\u2019s hard to watch someone you love be emotionally abused. I don\u2019t fault you for wanting him to see it right now. \n\nMy stepdaughters mom never shows up to anything and rarely has her but in therapy last week she wrote me a letter about how I hurt her feelings when I had a bad day and her & my son were being turds. (which was fair I am a human being and I can\u2019t be the perfect parent) but she has yet to write her mom a letter for abandoning her on holidays or forgetting her at school on the only day of the week she has her. Etc. it\u2019s never going to be fair for a step parent. So many stories online from adult stepkids about emotionally abusive step parents all over the internet and it does happen but I\u2019d be curious to know how much of it is them reacting to being treated like crap by a child they break their back for. \n\nBest thing you can do for yourself and your dad is to focus on your relationship with one another - you\u2019re allowed to pretend she doesn\u2019t exist. No contact or low contact can be so healing.

Yes, not surprised to hear that.", "Yep. I'm a senior in high school.", "Just want to point out that this may be her trying to put effort into a relationship that\u2019s important to her.

She's never been a sister to you, and didn't even invite you to the wedding.\n\nYTA for trying your dad he shouldn't. He loves her even if she doesn't return the feeling. He gets to choose his relationship, and you need to stay out of it.", "INFO:  What kind of parents have you had?  They seem either willfully blind or negligent.  Have they completely neglected you while racing around to ensure their darling girl had the life of dreams? Are they going to pay for your college, apartment, first home?

(Except the deadbeat father was meeting her on the sly after she left for college and he and his family were sending her money she didn\u2019t tell anyone about so she could keep getting money and sympathy from the mother and stepdad.  The other kids in the family suffered, though.)", "NTA, you don't give people who treat you badly any space in your life.

It drives me crazy the lengths people go through just to be accepted by an ungrateful individual after all these years she still has no regard for his feelings, and he is just being a doormat while your mother allows this behavior. If it had been me, I would've told my husband not to give her a penny it just fortified that your mother had no problem with your half sibling's behavior.\n\nTell your mom that you refuse to be used as a prop to make her and your sister look good.

Sure, you can point out how Elizabeth has screwed over both your parents, and how you're not as close as your mom likes to believe, but you don't get to tell people what they should or shouldn't do. That is classic invalidation and is generally just mean and lacking in empathy.\n\nYou can disagree with how someone feels about something, you can say it's not how you'd feel or react to a situation, but you don't get to dictates others' emotions. This is an important lesson you need to learn.\n\nIf they wanna go, that's their choice. Same as if they wanna give her money.

I really wish Dad\u2019s, both bio and step, would read a book about teenagers before trying the iron fist routine lol.

I don't know if this perspective will help, but I hope it does. I'm not a stepkid, but I've had to work through some trauma with my parents as an adult. And one thing that I've realized is that the times I've tried to talk to them about things they did that hurt me? It was because I still had hope that we could repair our relationship. Our relationship still mattered to me, and that's why I talked to them about it. Unfortunately, based on their responses, I realized they weren't as invested in repairing what had broken, and I've stopped telling them about things that hurt. So in some ways, talking about her feelings with you might be a sign that she still cares, that you mean more to her than her bio mom does. I hope the two of you can still find healing and have a relationship that feels good", "I would bet it's because she feels safer with you than her mother. You'll be there even when she's upset with you. She can't chance being openly mad at her mom and scaring her away.", "AMLPYPLD - I honestly wonder if your stepdaughter wrote about you hurting her feelings in therapy because it did have more of an effect on her than her mother's actions. If her mom has always been a neglectful parent she expects it and it may not hurt as much. She on some level knows she can rely on you and doesn't expect the pain to come from you. \n\nAs a parent I know it will happen to all kids at some point from all parents, because people aren't perfect. Kids that have been hurt more than normal by a parent may expect other parents/stepparents to be more perfect because they are somewhat on a pedestal as being the better adult in their life. \n\nOP - Whatever the her reasons, they no longer justify her actions to people that cared (your dad).  You can't make him turn his back to protect him, until he's ready and your parents won't thank you if you push. But you don't have to accept her treatment towards you. I agree LC or NC is more than likely better for your mental health.", "I disagree. While she was a minor, yes, he had a responsibility to provide for her by being married to her mother.
