Big sister hugs if you'll accept them.\n\n>She practically ran like her ass was on fire once she got the money. Then she announced that she had met her bio dad and he would be father of the bride at her wedding and my dad was a regular old guest.\n\nThis happens much too often. \n\nCan we start an organization of volunteers who find weddings where this kind of thing happened and plant an easel at the reception with a big sign saying \"this celebration was brought to you by the generous sponsorship of *they who were wronged*\" with a photo of *they who were wronged* on it?", "Being the chaotic person that I am, I will go to the wedding and make a  suprise speech about her on reception being a terrible daughter and half sister while wishing luck to his future husband. lol", "NTA, but there is something you need to understand, your dad does not see this situation the same way you do.\n\nYes, she is a giant asshole and a user, but I think your dad is fulfilling his duty.  He is there for her, providing, and caring *unconditionally*.  He does not see this as a transactional relationship and, while I am sure on some level he wishes she would give back, it is not necessary to him.  He is fulfilled by being the provider.  If you want to point to one thing that sets a \"real man\" apart--this is it.  Not how much you lift, how well you shoot, how far you run, how many shots you down, how many chick you bang...  it is \"do you provide for your family\"?\n\nYou can advice him, say your piece, make your own decision about going, but I would then let it go.\n\nOne thing I would do while trying to convince him is to ask him why?  One of two things will happen:  He will realize that this is useless and join you or he will fully explain to you why in a way that you will understand.", "NTA. But it's not your place to tell your dad what to do.\n\nI hope your sister trips walking down the aisle.", "NTA, you half sister is a piece of work and hope your dad sees it too", "NTA, unless of course you want to go and just quietly and subtly, without making a scene to her, mention to everyone you interact with how great it was for your dad to pay for this entire wedding.", "NTA. Except for your mom and her other child. it\u2019s pretty fucking sad that your mother is choosing sides when it\u2019s obvious that her other daughter has mistreated everyone in her family.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t go", "So is your mother talking to Elizabeth about her cruel and selfish behavior or just wishing she will change? \n\nYou are setting boundaries and encouraging your father to do so also. You are NOT behaving anything like Elizabeth.\n\nStay strong. You are doing the right thing. Your mother needs to wake up from her little fantasy world and realize she raise a horrible daughter.\n\nNTA", "Your mom has a child and wanted a man for that child. You just happened. When you see your life under this prism, if it makes sense, then you know how you need to proceed. By the way, your dad should ask for the wedding money back. NTA", "YTA for telling your dad what to do. He probably supports her for your mom. I think it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t go but you shouldn\u2019t tell your Dad what to do. If he doesn\u2019t go it will hurt your mom more than your sister. She already got the money.", "NTA - you can not go, but you need to let your dad to manage his own relationship with her.", "NTA but...\n\nYou can't prevent your dad from trying with Elizabeth. It doesn't sound like she'll ever change, but your dad wants to try. The most you can do is limit your interactions with her. Your mom will have to accept that her kids just aren't close. \n\nAnd as someone with two older half-sisters that never wanted me, I want to wish you the best. Good on you for sticking up for yourself.", "You can't take the rose-coloured glasses off your parents, much as it sucks to watch them invest time and money in an awful person. Your mom sucks for supporting her awful daughter instead of her own husband. That's almost as bad as Elizabeth's behaviour. But while your dad refuses to snap out of it, none of that matters. It's not your fight. Let them waste their money and continue to have nothing to do with it.", "NtA. It\u2019s truly amazing how people will stick with the shitty person so often.", "NTA\n\nIt's a shame your dad has been through this, however, he's decided to accept this.\n\nIf it was me, I'd go, I'd make a speech.  Let all the guests know how happy he is that they attended the wedding he is hosting for his step daughter. Using STEP many times.\n\nIf he chooses not to attend, he should also stop any future payments for the wedding.  The bill sent directly to step daughter. Period.", "NTA\n\nFor starters, it sounds like you never actually got an invitation. That means, regardless of what she told yoyr mother, you aren't actually invited\n\nYour mom needs to stop forcing this. She wants to play happy family, but it's just causing resentment at this point because she's using your dad \n\nIf anyone asks, until there's a formal invite, it's \"you weren't invited\" don't let your sister save face here.", "ESH \u2013\u00a0there's absolutely no reason for you to go and your mom is delusional for thinking that you should *in spite of not being invited*.\n\nSucks for your dad, but it's his choice and you're out of line telling him not to go/to cut her out/whatever you told him.\n\nIf your account is accurate and unbiased, sounds like your stepsister is a real piece of work \u2013 sorry you have to deal with it.", "NTA. She isn\u2019t much of a sister, clearly doesn\u2019t care for you or your father, and probably doesn\u2019t want you there anyway. Stay away and be happy about it.", "\u201cShe said I\u2019m behaving badly like Elizabeth has.\u201d\n\nYour mom 100% knows how Elizabeth has treated your dad but wants to rug sweep. NTA. Stand your ground and don\u2019t go. Tell your dad to stop being such a fool.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is worried about the optics.  I get it, kind of embarrassing that she would be without a plus one when people know she is married.  She is also avoiding the questions about you.\n\nYou don't have a relationship with the bride.  No reason to fake it, especially when you are not invited.", "NTA\n\nElizabeth is an AH who makes her own decisions.   You don't have a relationship and, I agree, that you should not go.   There is no reason to want to go to that or any gathering for her.   \n\nAs far as your father, I feel sorry for him.   He keeps wanting a relationship with Elizabeth, but it just never happened.   He has come to understand who Elizabeth is.   That's why he is not phased by her horrible treatment.\n\nYou care about your Dad and don't want to see him hurt anymore.   You are not wrong to care about his emotional and mental health.   At the same time, you have to respect his decisions.   He want to keep trying to form a meaningful relationship with her.\n\nI can sympathize with that.   I have kids.   Parents have the choice to cut them off emotionally or to continue to try to love them.   Your father is choosing to continue in this one sided relationship.   It doesn't mean that he's wrong.   Only he can choose when he wants to stop trying with her.   \n\nMy suggestion is to talk to your dad.   Tell him that you are worried about him and his wellbeing.   Don't make the conversation be about Elizabeth.   Tell him that you love him and that you want the best for him because he has been the best father the he could.   Try to support him because when he finally gives up on Elizabeth, it sounds like it is going to be a huge emotional fallout.\n\nI have to believe that your Mom is kind of a small AH, too.   She has put her head in the sand to ignored these issues for two decades.   She ignored the emotional damage that it caused you and your dad.   Her insisting that you act like everything is fine, ignoring your choices as an eighteen-year-old is kind of telling.   Either she wants to put an outward appearance to others who will be present, or she is telling you that your emotional needs are not as important as her wants.\n\nEither way, be there for your dad.   He sounds like he's been through a lot.  I would maybe suggest talking to a counselor about the issues that Elizabeth has caused you.   If you can, get your Dad and Mom to come.  That session would probably be better.\n\nGood luck, OP.   You are looking out for the ones you care about.   There is never anything wrong with that.", "NTA. Tell your father to tell her that \"the father of the bride\" can pay for her wedding. She can't have it all", "NTA and they\u2019re both in denial. She\u2019s never going to \u201ccome around\u201d unless she wants something from him. I\u2019m sure it hurts them both like hell, but they\u2019re just enabling her disrespect by agreeing to pay for her wedding, attending and pretending she\u2019s a great person.", "NTA.\n\nShe's abusing your dad, it's really naive and harmful for anyone to encourage your dad to keep on getting abused.", "NTA. You completly agree with youur view and what you said to your parents. I do not agree with hteir reaction to it. \n\nBut here is the thing. You can not dictate how they should react. \n\nYou told them your experience, you told them what you thought they should to. You did your part.\n\nNow it is on them to decide what they do. And they have to live with that decision.", "NTA, though I doubt the relationship is as one-sidedly negative as you make it out to be. I'm sure it's much more mutual than this post suggests.", "NTA. Your mom needs to stop pretending there is any sisterhood between her daughters. She is hurting all of you this way.", "NTA - But you\u2019re an adult now. You manage your relationship with your sister and let his dad manage his own. That\u2019s how it works. Your dad can decide for himself what he needs to do.", "NTA.  Her husband deserve every bit of that when it becomes apparent that he is next.", "NTA. But your mom kinda is. She KNEW how Elizabeth felt and still had blinders on. She should be even more mad that her daughter used her husband for money.", "NTA. Not everyone deserves your effort but as for your dad- his relationship with her is for him to manage. \nProbably doesn\u2019t help but im a step mom and it seems like we always get shafted no matter what we do. Kids take their trauma for their parents not working out on us. Easy targets I guess. Most of us will break our backs to be viewed differently and will have to come to the conclusion that it\u2019s not working on our own. Gotta let him work through it as he experiences it.", "Nta", "NTA", "\ud83d\ude02 I kind of hope her bio dad is a no show. Evil though I know that is.", "Yup.  \u201cOh, hi, I\u2019m the bride\u2019s sister.  You didn\u2019t know she had one?  Not surprised.  We\u2019re half sisters and she has always hated my dad and myself, though he generously paid for the wedding since her own dad is a deadbeat. Enjoy the party!\u201d", "Yeah he\u2019s just being a sucker at this stage. If it was me, I would get mad and tell her \u201cnever again\u201d and cut her off.", "Agreed.  For the sake of OP's own sanity.", "Half sister but yeah. She's a lot. I know she probably has hurt that her dad wasn't around and chose to not be there. But at some point you either accept you don't care about your stepparent and half sibling(s) and just don't be part of their lives at all or expect anything from them. Or you find a way to at least be nice if not loving.", ">Sucks for your dad, but it's his choice and you're out of line telling him not to go/to cut her out/whatever you told him.\n\nyeah sucks to tell someone they shouldn't put up with abuse and manipulation anymore lol", "I think that was obvious with the lack of invite or mention of me on my parents invite. She only said of course to mom because of that money.", "No, that\u2019s utter bullshit. My brother and I never took the issues we had with our divorced parents out on our step dad. Because we weren\u2019t allowed to. I don\u2019t get why this shit is allowed and accepted the way it is today if it\u2019s not deserved.", "I get that. I just hate it for him. He has done so much and does go all out to try and make sure she's not missing out because of her deadbeat. I hate seeing him being viewed as just a wallet. But I know that's for him to work through and decide what he wants to do.", "And step father refuses to play \"walk down the aisle\" role.", "Half brother but I have said this to a couple of people in the past who were shocked to learn I existed.", "Do you live at home with your parents?", "Sometimes, for some people, being viewed as just a wallet is better than not being seen at all.  Your dad has probably struggled for a long time with the idea that some attention is better than no attention and could be a little blinded to it all.\n\nHe'll either see it or he won't.  The point here is to do for yourself what you think is best.  You've pointed out that your parents are wearing rose colored glasses.  You can't make them take them off.", "I understand. It\u2019s hard to watch someone you love be emotionally abused. I don\u2019t fault you for wanting him to see it right now. \n\nMy stepdaughters mom never shows up to anything and rarely has her but in therapy last week she wrote me a letter about how I hurt her feelings when I had a bad day and her & my son were being turds. (which was fair I am a human being and I can\u2019t be the perfect parent) but she has yet to write her mom a letter for abandoning her on holidays or forgetting her at school on the only day of the week she has her. Etc. it\u2019s never going to be fair for a step parent. So many stories online from adult stepkids about emotionally abusive step parents all over the internet and it does happen but I\u2019d be curious to know how much of it is them reacting to being treated like crap by a child they break their back for. \n\nBest thing you can do for yourself and your dad is to focus on your relationship with one another - you\u2019re allowed to pretend she doesn\u2019t exist. No contact or low contact can be so healing. Sharing dna doesn\u2019t give someone a pass to be a jerk.", "OP should go and give her dad a big hug before he walks in putting  a sign on his back \"Kick me, Lizzy already did after she took my money.\"", "Sorry, missed that.  Yes, not surprised to hear that.", "Yep. I'm a senior in high school.", "Just want to point out that this may be her trying to put effort into a relationship that\u2019s important to her. Perhaps mom doesn\u2019t come up in therapy because she has just given up on the relationship as a whole. It\u2019s not worth her effort."]}
