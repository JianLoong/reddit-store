Take him out and ask him to tell you the truth.\n\nShe doesnt get to say he cant hold both your baby. Its your child too, and you must let your eldest feel special and bond - even if its holding her whilst sitting down for one minute and you supporting the babys head.

Is this out of nowhere, or are there other instances, where your son was treated differently from other family or friends even? If it's one of, most likely pregnancy/PP stress and hormones.

I'm glad you stood your ground on this.", "NTA but your wife has some weird rules.\n\nUnless your 14yo son has some disability that would prevent him from holding the baby, he should be allowed that bonding time with it.  Toddlers are often allowed to hold new siblings, albeit with some parental supervision and assistance so a 14yo is certainly capable.\n\nIf your wife can make a weird rule about who can hold the baby, then so can OP.  A SIL doesn't get a free pass if a 14yo doesn't.", "NTA\n\nAnd this makes me so sad to read - even sadder to read people actually defending your wife, as if there's any legitimate reason to keep a teenager who WANTS to hold their new baby sibling and bond with them from doing so. The gross excuses here are just that: gross.\n\nIt was the encouragement to bond with their little half-siblings that has led my older niblings to not even think of their little siblings as \"halfs\", just their little sisters and brothers. And the youngest of them was not even in the double digits when the first younger half-sibling was born. She was still allowed to hold her, as long as she was sitting down and careful. There is NO good reason for a mother who does not have PPD/PPA (and clearly she doesn't if she's not nervous about others holding her child) to keep an older sibling (who, shocker, happens to be her stepchild) from bonding with their new sibling. It's disgusting and hateful, period, and you are NTA for pointing it out to her.", "NTA. youre simply following your wife's wishes :)", "NTA. It will go downhill from here though. Start taking special care of your son so he gets some attention. Clearly he has no bond with your wife. That's so crazy. My stepdaughter was 4th to hold my son, only because I had him on Tuesday and we didn't get her until Wednesday evening. Literally kept everyone but my mom away until she saw her brother. \n\nMan. Ouch.", "NTA.  There's no reason your son can't hold the baby but her sis can.  Does your wife normally exclude your son from things?", "NTA - your wife set a boundary and you held it.

That your wife didn't think it was very important baffles me.", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing your older son is your son with someone else.

I think that would have been best dealt with AFTER her sister left, though. Let it happen, let her hold him. After, have a conversation about how you feel, and then stand up for your son.

And half her kids (youngest was sick, so oldest stayed home with her, but wasn\u2019t comfortable keeping all 3 younger siblings). Within an hour of birth, my oldest had been held by grandparents, his great grandmother, his 17yo uncle, my aunt and uncle, and 2 cousins (the older of the cousins being 11 at the time).
