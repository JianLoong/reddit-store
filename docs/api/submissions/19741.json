Take him out and ask him to tell you the truth.\n\nShe doesnt get to say he cant hold both your baby. Its your child too, and you must let your eldest feel special and bond - even if its holding her whilst sitting down for one minute and you supporting the babys head.

Toddlers are often allowed to hold new siblings, albeit with some parental supervision and assistance so a 14yo is certainly capable.\n\nIf your wife can make a weird rule about who can hold the baby, then so can OP.  A SIL doesn't get a free pass if a 14yo doesn't.", "NTA\n\nAnd this makes me so sad to read - even sadder to read people actually defending your wife, as if there's any legitimate reason to keep a teenager who WANTS to hold their new baby sibling and bond with them from doing so. The gross excuses here are just that: gross.\n\nIt was the encouragement to bond with their little half-siblings that has led my older niblings to not even think of their little siblings as \"halfs\", just their little sisters and brothers. And the youngest of them was not even in the double digits when the first younger half-sibling was born. She was still allowed to hold her, as long as she was sitting down and careful. There is NO good reason for a mother who does not have PPD/PPA (and clearly she doesn't if she's not nervous about others holding her child) to keep an older sibling (who, shocker, happens to be her stepchild) from bonding with their new sibling. It's disgusting and hateful, period, and you are NTA for pointing it out to her.", "NTA. youre simply following your wife's wishes :)", "NTA. It will go downhill from here though. Start taking special care of your son so he gets some attention. Clearly he has no bond with your wife. That's so crazy. My stepdaughter was 4th to hold my son, only because I had him on Tuesday and we didn't get her until Wednesday evening. Literally kept everyone but my mom away until she saw her brother. \n\nMan. Ouch.", "NTA.  There's no reason your son can't hold the baby but her sis can.  Does your wife normally exclude your son from things?", "NTA - your wife set a boundary and you held it.

That your wife didn't think it was very important baffles me.", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing your older son is your son with someone else.

I\u2019m sure your son feels like a black sheep, especially after not being allowed to hold his own sibling.\n\nMake sure you stick to this and have a good conversation with your wife privately about it. Also try to make sure your son is included in everything or when he\u2019s 18 he\u2019ll be out the door and resent you and your wife. It\u2019s very important he gets to bond with his sibling now.", "What\u2019s her plan for when the baby becomes a teenager? Is she going to try then?", "She needs to learn, she has had 3 years.", "Tell her you talk to them like regular people, they usually speak the same language as the country they live in.", "So she doesn't know how to talk without being an asshole got it", "This makes me so sad for your son. It is so hurtful and depressing to live with someone who constantly \u201cteases\u201d you (i.e., makes fun of you and hurts your feelings). And not only that, but his actual father, who brought him into this world, writes it off as \u201cthey\u2019re awkward! It\u2019s her communication style!\u201d\n\nYou can learn to communicate without being mean or hurtful. I\u2019d argue this should have been her priority long before marrying or even meeting you. Adults do not continue to tease people who dislike it and then ignore them otherwise - those are the actions of a bully. If you described her treatment of him as you did to me without telling me she was your wife, I\u2019d honestly assume she was a bratty teenaged girl.\n\nYour son didn\u2019t ask to be born. You decided to have him, to bring him into this world. It is always the parent\u2019s responsibility to ensure that they are the first source of acceptance, love, and comfort a child will find in this cold world. Anything else - having a girlfriend or a wife to ease the loneliness, having a hobby, partying on weekends, WHATEVER - all are second to the well-being of your actual child. A real person, who is learning about the world and what kind of treatment to expect and tolerate based on what he\u2019s experiencing at home.\n\nIt may not be the case that he feels that hurt. Maybe he does just feel \u201cawkward.\u201d But to act like there\u2019s no way for you to get those answers as his father is to do a disservice to your son, wife, and finally to yourself.\n\nWe\u2019re not on this earth to feel good all the time and have everyone and everything we want. If your wife is treating your son differently and there is potential for it to escalate now that you two have a new baby, it is your duty to find out and protect your children. BOTH of them. \n\nI wish you and your family the best of luck. I hope you all can find peace and comfort with each other; every family deserves it.", "      She can\u2019t talk to him without teasing him?", "Yeah I\u2019m sorry but your wife is sounding more and more like an AH in this situation. She doesn\u2019t speak to your child because he doesn\u2019t like being teased, think about that for a second. She should be the adult in this relationship and reach out to him on his own terms. He isn\u2019t too sensitive, she is too insensitive. Why do you think that\u2019s ok? She clearly doesn\u2019t like him because she wouldn\u2019t let him hold his sibling and it\u2019s your job to let her know that a. He will be part of this babies life b. She needs to treat him differently and with respect (not glib mocking, the actions of a bully) and c. Your children- including your teenage son- are the most important people in your life.", "And she's clearly never grown out of that bullying age. Don't be surprised if your sun goes low to no contact with you both in a few years.", "Why would you marry a woman who can\u2019t even hold a conversation with your son, without upsetting him?", "TEASING FROM A PARENT ISN'T PLAYFUL! She's going to be more of an AH to your son if she can't talk to a kid without teasing him.  Not talking to him is ignoring him.  Since she now has her own child, she's going to be even less interested in your son.  She doesn't see the new baby as your son's sibling.  If she struggles with communication, then she should get some therapy, because of her crappy attitude about your son, family counseling may be in order for everyone.  Your son may be better off living with his mom, if she's a decent person.  Your son is not going to do well with your wife since she doesn't appear to want to be his mother.", "Ahh, well my apologies then, I have overread that part how it seems", "[removed]", "It's like you think the only two options he has are \"Behave childishly and passive aggressively towards your sister in law\" or \"Do and say absolutely nothing to your wife and never express in any way that you're unhappy with how she's acted.\"\n\nThere's a third option where he talks to his wife and expresses that he is unhappy with how she acted and works through it without being a passive aggressive child.", "Then you should try to be more useful \ud83e\udd2a", "My spouse has full siblings and half siblings.

I had a real life baby to play with and I LOVED it\ud83d\ude02. my sister and stepsister were 13 when he was born and my mom never kept any of us from him.

I\u2019ll always cherish those memories.\n\nConversely I was 14 when my stepsister had her first and she was being a pill at the time. When I met her son I asked to hold him and she refused, told me I wasn\u2019t allowed anywhere near him. I was heartbroken because I was so excited to meet my newest nephew.

He just sat on the sofa with a cushion and her on top.", "It's anyone's guess and nothing more.", "This, I understand she just had a baby, so honestly if she felt that he wouldn\u2019t know how to hold the child, she should\u2019ve to her HUSBAND to show him or help him.

He said she set a rule yesterday that she wasn't comfortable with anyone holding their child, and today he followed the rule that she set. That's not being an asshole that's being consistent. I could see how the mother is a jerk though for literally less than 24 hours ago saying she doesn't want but her and her husband holding the baby, but now it's completely okay that someone in her family hold the baby. Her problem here is with her step-son and lying about it by saying she doesn't want anyone but mom and dad holding the baby. By her logic if he's an ass for refusing her sister hold the baby, then she is by refusing the son to hold him.", "Why does him not being comfortable with it make it purely retribution? Maybe he isn't comfortable with someone holding his baby before his son gets to bond with it. It's completely reasonable for him to think that after his baby has bonded with him and the mother that the next person to hold and bond with him should be his other son. He might also not be comfortable with how this might make his son feel with his step-mom saying that she's not comfortable with anyone holding and then reneging on that for someone else. Maybe he thinks it would make his son resentful to the step-mother and new baby and he's not comfortable with it. \n\nSo it's okay for the mother to be uncomfortable with someone holding their baby and voice it, and the dad not agreeing with it but respecting the decision. But it's not okay for the dad, while respecting and following the decision of the mother to not let anyone else hold the baby, to be uncomfortable with it and voice it? That's very hypocritical. And on top of it she didn't respect his decision, which was really just following her decision, and called him an ass for it.", "this is exactly my in-laws. it's so lovely!", "I am so sorry for you and your nephew.

What was it like when he was 12?", "I need to call my aunts and uncles more!", "\nHe wasn't the only parent deciding, she was when she stated it was to only be the parents. He did address it He agreed by not letting his son hold the kid and then tried to hold up those same standards the next time the situation occurred, it was HER that went back on the agreement of \"no one but the parents\" holding the baby."]}
