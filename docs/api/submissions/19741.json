You son is the half sibling - again more important than an aunt. You defend him and keep doing so. He is the next person to hold that child. Also are you sure how she is treating your son when you are not there? Poor boy its going to get so much worse now she has her own kid. Take him out and ask him to tell you the truth.\n\nShe doesnt get to say he cant hold both your baby. Its your child too, and you must let your eldest feel special and bond - even if its holding her whilst sitting down for one minute and you supporting the babys head.  She can't unilaterally make absurd decisions. There is no reason he cant holder her unless he is abusive, likely to hurt her, is ill and contagious.", "INFO: How is the relationship between your son and your wife?", "NTA.

Is this out of nowhere, or are there other instances, where your son was treated differently from other family or friends even? If it's one of, most likely pregnancy/PP stress and hormones.

Her family is good enough, but yours is not? I\u2019m currently pregnant and told everyone that our 12 yr old son is going to be the first to hold our daughter after my husband and I, everyone understood and agreed.

I'm glad you stood your ground on this.", "NTA but your wife has some weird rules.\n\nUnless your 14yo son has some disability that would prevent him from holding the baby, he should be allowed that bonding time with it.  Toddlers are often allowed to hold new siblings, albeit with some parental supervision and assistance so a 14yo is certainly capable.\n\nIf your wife can make a weird rule about who can hold the baby, then so can OP.  A SIL doesn't get a free pass if a 14yo doesn't.", "NTA\n\nAnd this makes me so sad to read - even sadder to read people actually defending your wife, as if there's any legitimate reason to keep a teenager who WANTS to hold their new baby sibling and bond with them from doing so. The gross excuses here are just that: gross.\n\nIt was the encouragement to bond with their little half-siblings that has led my older niblings to not even think of their little siblings as \"halfs\", just their little sisters and brothers. And the youngest of them was not even in the double digits when the first younger half-sibling was born. She was still allowed to hold her, as long as she was sitting down and careful. There is NO good reason for a mother who does not have PPD/PPA (and clearly she doesn't if she's not nervous about others holding her child) to keep an older sibling (who, shocker, happens to be her stepchild) from bonding with their new sibling. It's disgusting and hateful, period, and you are NTA for pointing it out to her.", "NTA. youre simply following your wife's wishes :)", "NTA. It will go downhill from here though. Start taking special care of your son so he gets some attention. Clearly he has no bond with your wife. That's so crazy. My stepdaughter was 4th to hold my son, only because I had him on Tuesday and we didn't get her until Wednesday evening. Literally kept everyone but my mom away until she saw her brother. \n\nMan. Ouch.", "NTA.  There's no reason your son can't hold the baby but her sis can.  Does your wife normally exclude your son from things?", "NTA - your wife set a boundary and you held it.

That your wife didn't think it was very important baffles me.", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing your older son is your son with someone else.

Your wife is a hypocrite.", "Your wife can't have it both ways. Your son is 14 so he has sense how to hold a baby, OK if he was 4 than I could understand her a bit.

I think that would have been best dealt with AFTER her sister left, though. Let it happen, let her hold him. After, have a conversation about how you feel, and then stand up for your son.

Did the last one not work out *for some reason?*\n\nEdit: honestly if the son is only yours, again just a guess from the wide age gap between him and the baby, I'm leaning more YTA than ESH. It's totally understandable that your wife, who *just* gave birth, is more comfortable with her sister holding the baby than your son. It's something you should talk about and work out, she needs to learn to trust and be ok with your son too, but it's not like it's in not perfectly understandable that your wife who's drowning in post-pregnancy hormones and just gave birth, is comfortable with her sister holding the baby but not your son.", "Amazing these children survive...relatives, friends, dogs, cats, etc etc etc. Honestly...past generation did not isolate babies/children and they built immunities for common germs.", "Do all the pro op people here realize that we are talking about a teen kid here not a grown adult and we don't know the relationship between the kid and the baby/mom, is there jealousy?

Telling a teenaged kid that he can't hold his own half-sibling for no good reason at all is absolutely awful. My niblings were encouraged to bond with their half-siblings immediately and enthusiastically, and because of that they don't even think of them as \"halfs\". And the youngest was only 9 when her first half-sister was born . . . still allowed to hold her as long as she was sitting down. \n\nThis whole post just makes me so sad, and even sadder that people are defending the wife.
