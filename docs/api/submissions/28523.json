She sometimes gets overly stressed about trivial things and lashes out to us (my father, sibiling and I) because the things are not going her way or because she thinks they are not going her way.   \n\nJust 2 weeks ago I helped her to send a test in the form of a google survey because she had issues with the captcha. On this time she didn't understand why the page was \"not allowing her answers\" and was upset my sister was \"out with her boyfriend and not helping her\", all while stomping her feet like a 5 yo. I solved the captcha and the answer got sent. Instead of being happy, she got panicked because \"I could have touched the answers and change them, and she could fail because of that\", so she started to make this fake crying/child bubbling (yes, it sounds like that and it's annoying as heck). I was having none of it and just kicked her out. Off course, everything was fine when the results came, so she behave like a child for nothing once again.   \n\nBetween this attitudes and the fact that she is unwilling to address the issue by going to a psychologist as advised by the entire family, I am at my wits ends with her.   \n\nToday she decided she didn't wanted to go to our uncle's home for a BBQ (it's a weekly thing for our family to do so as to spend some time with relatives) because she is tired.   \n\nI've returned home bringing her something to eat.

Hes her husband, and as such it should fall to him to help his wife.\n\nMy best friend's Mother was like that, always the victim, always so helpless and just like a child in behavior, attitude and responses.

Even if it's worse now, this is part of her identity and it's not going to change. If you can't tolerate it, you may do better with less of her in your life.\n\nShe probably can't make an appointment to see a therapist. Not because she's physically incapable, but because there are too many scary steps between now and that appointment. The only way you'll get her to that appointment is to have someone make it for her, make sure she's up on the day and ready before the appointment, drive her to the appointment, make her go in, and probably buy her an ice cream and make a fuss of her after it (as well as making the next appointment).\n\nPeople can change, but usually not very radically. It sounds like she's regressed to her childhood self more and more due to stressors you might not be familiar with. She probably doesn't want to \"grow up\" and have to take responsibility for the shit she's avoiding.\n\nLike with children and pets you will probably do better with selective positive reinforcement. Ignore the childish behaviour, celebrate and reward adult behaviour.
