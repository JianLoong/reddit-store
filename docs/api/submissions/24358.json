So if you do need a break, give yourself one. Use the hotel money to take a solo vacation or go somewhere with family/friends where she can't find you (i.e. the kids need to be on an information diet so she can't get it out of them).

I went thru something similar 20 years ago and it was gawd awful.  Sadly, it's often the price you pay for marrying someone who has minor children.

I was keeping my distance from my SD because her mom is missing a few screws and it really damaged our relationship. The best thing to do it prove to the kids that you\u2019re kind and loving and pretty much that their mom is creating a false narrative and she is wrong by her own choice. \n\nAlso, even when I did stay away from my SD she would still lie and make stuff up and even tell my stepdaughter that I called my SD names (crazy has no bounds). \n\nDocument and call the police. My SDs mom has a no contact order and probation now. She stays away from me but still talks her crazy mess. It\u2019s all being documented for the courts.

That\u2019s not correct. Screenshots of her online abuse will do a lot to show the truth of the matter. For the in-person harassment,  your testimony about these incidents is evidence in and of itself. Did you text anyone about it? Write anything down? That\u2019s contemporaneous notes that can back up your recollections too. Look up legal aid organizations in your area and get moving on a restraining order.
