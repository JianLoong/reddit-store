And as an older non-neurotypical person, I'd like to give you a little advice.\nMoney with family and friends is always going to work differently than for work and business. Right now you're viewing this as a work transaction, where you've performed a task and expect payment. This is reasonable considering how it was presented to you in the beginning.\n\nThe thing is, a lack of money makes people uncomfortable, so they'll speak in pleasantries and code about it. When your mom brushed you aside with \"it's not the time or place,\" that was the code for \"I don't have it/it's not in the budget\", especially if you were in public, where having that conversation would be embarrassing.\n\nKeeping tabs on what a friend or relative owes you is seen as greedy or miserly. If you \"lend\" a friend who is struggling $20 every now and then, coming at them 6 months later with \"you owe me $60\" is going to make you lose that friend, as well as mutual friends.\n\nMy advice:\n1) apologize to your mom about calling her names\n2) make sure that when you talk to anyone you're related to or friends with about money owed between you, that it's in private.\n3) learn to let go of small debts from people you care about. Especially if it's been more than a month or two.\n4) caveat: don't lend money you can't afford to lose, and don't let yourself be taken advantage of. It's one thing to pony up some gas money or pay for a meal on occasion; it's quite another to always be the one who pays\n5) this does not apply to actual employers or other business transactions\n\nGood luck OP", "It's one thing to have a conversation about why allowance money has stopped, but to tell her you need backpay.. YTA\n\nBy the way, you're lucky to get an allowance at all, and after being called a scammer... that allowance would be on pause until further notice.\n\nMaybe your mom is going through a sudden financial struggle, and now their child is calling them a scammer and asking for more money. Think about how that sounds.", "ESH. \n\nAn allowance is a privilege, and while yes, it does suck that she didn't hold up her end of the bargain, she probably couldn't afford to.

Allowance isn\u2019t just an earned thing. You have to consider the household finances too. The fact is?

Allowance is nice, but not necessarily to have. I survived without any allowances, and if you really need money you can always get a part time job. She doesn't owe you money for helping out around the house.

A calm sit down may lead to your desired results, escalation will not. \n\nI will say that I was never given an allowance for the chores I did. It was just assumed as part of the household we all pitched in, my parents, myself and my sibling.\n\nHowever, I was also fortunate enough to live in a town where I had summer jobs so I learned how to earn and budget money separate from my parent\u2019s pocket. I don\u2019t know if this would have been different if I didn\u2019t have that opportunity. \n\nI do want to say that N T A for asking for the money but YTA for how you addressed the situation and the way you\u2019ve been insulting and arguing with others in the comments. \n\nBest of luck and I hope you\u2019re able to have a beneficial conversation with your mom soon.", "ESH.

But you do have to do chores and help keep the household you live in, clean. \n\nDid you think,that maybe for those weeks your mom was tight on money?", "Don\u2019t call your mom a lying scum. INFO How long have you been getting an allowance? Was the payment on time before? I ask this because did you ever realize there might be financial issues your mother is struggling with and she can\u2019t afford to give you your allowance? She may not want you to worry.  I am not sure your age, but I think she should talk to you about budgeting and finances so you fathom how hard she may be having it right now. If she is just not keeping up with an agreement, well that isn\u2019t ok, BUT calling her a lying scum isn\u2019t ever a good idea. Why would you do this?", "YTA.

Though I think that after calling her a lying scammer, you no longer need to worry about that, because I'm pretty sure that your allowance is now a thing of the past.", "ESH. \n\nYour mom should be teaching you to keep your word, follow through with what you promise, and communicate with love whenever that's not possible. She's not setting a good example for you.\n\nYou should contribute to the household you live in regardless of whether you're paid or not. That's your duty as someone who lives there, not just something you do in exchange for money. And also you shouldn't speak to your mother like that.", "You get that you\u2019re not owed allowance, right? You\u2019re expected to contribute to the household you live in chore-wise regardless of getting compensation for it. Stop being a brat. Also, at 15 you\u2019re old enough to get a part time job. YTA", "You sweet summer child. \n\nBy all means when you enter the workforce, that is how things work but at home it\u2019s different. An allowance is a privilege. You\u2019re not entitled to it and you shouldn\u2019t expect to get one for simply taking care of the home you live in. \n\nSmall Yta cause you\u2019re still learning how the world works.", "Honestly a light ESH. \n\nYes your mom made an agreement with you which she has broken several times, and that's not right. If money was tight those weeks, she should have explained that to you, because you're old enough to know the harsher realities of life; sometimes $15 can literally make or break you, the difference between being able to get to work that week or afford the electric payment that month so it won't get shut off. Unfortunately that's a reality for many families, and something you will probably experience in the next 5-10 years. \n\nBut you should also not have kept a running tally of the 22 weeks she hasn't given you an allowance because if she has trouble paying $15 some weeks, there's no way she'd be able to just give you $330 at once. That's not realistic and it probably just makes your mom feel like a bad mother even if she wouldn't say that out loud. \n\nAlso if you really do want extra money for yourself, get a little part time job at a local store, or offer babysitting services. You should still be helping around the house though, allowance or not, because it teaches you to do those things for when you're one your own. Trust me I know plenty of people who got to college and didn't know how to clean, cook, do laundry, etc. And you need to know those things and how to do them properly.", "I think both of you are the asshole, but mostly your mom right now.  \nYour mom should be transparent about everything. She shouldn't have told you $15 per week for certain chores and then not paid when you did them. If she can't afford that or doesn't want to, she should have just made them required chores and set your allowance way lower or to nothing at all. I never gave my daughter an allowance and she is just expected to do chores throughout the week. If she doesn't then she loses priveleges like her tablet.  \nHowever she is still your mom and like others have pointed out you are living there for free and getting food and shelter. She doesn't owe you any money for that. Everyone - not just kids - need to stop acting like they're entitled to the world giving them more than they are already getting. Obviously your mom is either too flaky or can't afford to pay the money. So do your chores and if you need cash then find a side business like babysitting or lawn mowing or snow shoveling.", "YTA and given your attitude, you don\u2019t deserve an allowance.", "YTA and based on your responses, also an entitled brat and I can\u2019t wait for life to kick your ass.", "ESH\n\nYour mom should have stuck to the promise of 15 / wk allowance if that was the original promise. \n\nYou however sound like a spoiled brat, and I imagine in about 5 years you'll calm down and look back at this memory with some embarrassment and fondness. \n\nI don't know if you're aware, but most of us (adults) are gearing up for what looks like will be a pretty rough recession. Layoffs have already begun in certain industries. Your mom maybe struggling financially, or getting ready to weather the roughness of the recession by saving money. Should she have told you this? Yes. Making sure the household is secure financially is more important than you getting a bigmac after school. \n\nYour mom should not have broken the promise without telling you, but also you should understand that at any point she has the ability to break the promise and still be in the right. You are not entitled to a fifteen dollar a week allowance for doing chores, you should already be contributing to the house. \n\nTL:DR Kid is spoiled, but mom still should have told him.", "INFO: where is your father? Is your mother a single mom working to ensure everything else you need is covered?", "Yes, a bit of an asshole. \n\nYour mom is paying for house, food, electric, you name it. If she was flushed with cash, I'm sure your $15 would be paid promptly. I'm pretty sure she doesn't need you to remind her of this fact by your $330 comment. Money causes a lot of stress, she doesn't need that added to by you.\n\nAt your age, it's hard, but at some point you need to grow up. Consider everything she does pay for and consider what you can do to help her, instead of demanding what she can do for you.", "ESH\n\nShe's wrong to not pay what she agreed to. But. It's a bit unreasonable to just hit her with a huge bill, when you could have easily flagged to her when she forgot previously. It's kind of manipulative that you did that bc you obviously didn't forget. You may try to get something like $100 but I think you may need to kiss the bulk of it goodbye.\n\nEG if you don't cash a cheque for 6-12 months, it's no longer possible to cash it.\n\nI think you need to negotiate a middle ground.

I doubt you were talking to her in a reasonable manner when approaching the situation especially when you end up calling your own mother a lying scammer.

Instead of showing compassion/empathy you chose to be single minded and a little cruel.

She could say \"I know you've been getting an allowance, but it's not something I can keep doing right now. I know this is disappointing, but it's just the reality right now.\" Then you'd know where you stood instead of in this confusing place about the whole thing.

Call CPS and tell them your horrid tale, they'll laugh too.", "After reading some comments from redditors and from OP, I feel like everyone in this entire thread is acting a bit emotional. Let's break it out by points. This may be a controversial take but I hope it helps in some way:\n\n**- allowance payment:** at face value with info provided, OP and mom made an agreement to trade services for money (do x chores for $15/week). OP did those chores for 22 weeks ($330 total/$15 weekly = 22 weeks) with no payment. Mom did not hold up her end of the deal. To any \"adult\" on here who's telling this \"child\" it's his bedtime, would you be ok with it if your job did not pay you for 22 weeks? How many of you have lent money to someone and they \"promise\" to pay you back and never do? How well does that go over? Calling OP names does not make you look more mature, and we should understand where his frustrations are coming from.\n\n**-your mom might be struggling:** very possible, she needs to come forward and communicate that so y'all can change your agreement. OP, you need to be open to this communication and understand you may never get your allowance and accept that this as a possible outcome. This shouldn't be a \"me vs my mom\" it should be a \"us vs problem\" especially if this is the case. Your mom loves you and you love your mom, remember that.\n\n**- your house is your responsibility:** True, but this does not change the fact your mom promised you payment for chores and for 22 weeks she did not hold up her end. Plus, when you discussed it with her regularly for 22 weeks she refused to pay and now insinuates she will not pay you. That being said, she is your mom and has no obligation to pay you for chores. If you do have a discussion and it ends in the fact that you will have chores with no payment, you are living in her house under her rules and you need to respect that. You are a minor now, but when you move out and have your own place this will change. You're 15, we're talking 3 years away.\n\n**- name calling:** that was wrong of you to call her mom names. It most likely came from a place of high emotion because of the frustration/resentment building up over 22 weeks, but it was still wrong. I recommend you apologize for that (and mean it). If you do, it may be the opening to explain why you have felt so frustrated, to ask why isn't she holding up her end, and to explore what can y'all together do about it going forward. \n\n**- behavior/school work being up to standard:** was this ever a point of contingency on the chores agreement?

You\u2019re old enough to understand, and being left in the dark is a rough feeling for anyone. \n\nThat being said, your attitude towards the whole thing is also a problem. You\u2019re very stuck on this \u201cpromise\u201d your mom broke. Yes, she should have followed through or talked to you about it, but believing that any promise made to you will be kept is incredibly naive. You\u2019re going to go out into the world and have people lie to you or drop their end of the bargain - family, friends, bosses, etc. Does it suck? Yeah. But going around throwing a tantrum every time someone \u201cbreaks a promise\u201d is childish and you\u2019ll get exhausted quickly.\n\nI get how you feel, but your mom isn\u2019t psychic. The mindset that \u201cwell if she didn\u2019t know how finances were going to end up, she shouldn\u2019t have made the promise in the first place\u201d is dumb. So no one can make promises then, because they don\u2019t know all about the future? She chose to give you money that she didn\u2019t have to. Calling her a scammer is immature.\n\nI saw a comment of yours asking if you should be grateful because she does the bare minimum a parent should and doesn\u2019t abuse you. Yes. You don\u2019t know what that feels like, so you don\u2019t see a reason to, I get it. But just\u2026yes.

Otherwise they're soon 18 and completely lost. Very likely the 15 year old has no idea. I found when my son was grown, he thought I made twice as much as I did.  He thought I just didn't want him to have anything.  I should have talked to him as a teen.. Agree with the rest too.", "OH NO, I'M HOLDING HER ACCOUNTABLE FOR A PROMISE SHE MADE, HOWEVER WILL SHE COPE???", "I'd agree if she didn't promise.

I suspect she is suffering more than you could ever imagine.", "Because living under a roof, food, water, and electricity is more important than a 'promised payment'.\n\nThese are things that kids don't want to think of.

That is a legitimate reason as to why she cannot afford the additional expense of an allowance. Parents shouldn\u2019t ever be involving their children in discussions about financial hardship so please consider that.", "You're being incredibly rude and insulting. Your mother has to pay for everything else for herself and you, and I'm guessing your allowance falls pretty low on the list of priorities. You can ask, she can say no. You are not owed anything, and your behavior is reason enough for her to completely cancel your allowance going forward.", "Better than you without any money.", "I will say that we should talk to our kids about money issues.  Otherwise kids grow up knowing nothing about how things work.  My guess is that she put off paying you because groceries cost more or financial expenses came up. Now she can't possibly pay it all at once. You don't need it so how about a fresh start. Talk to her without accusing her. You might spend some time on the internet looking into financial topics.", "You only choose to perform the bare minimum because you're promised money?", "She should make you get a job.", "Before she made you that promise, did you do your chores and avoid trouble? My guess is, if your mom had to motivate you with payment, you were probably a lazy, trouble-making AH before this \u201cpromise\u201d and it was the motivation she could think of to get you to straighten up.\n\nMaybe at the time, she had the $15 and it was worth it for her in the moment to bribe you to meet bare minimum expectations for a kid. Seems like either financial situation has changed since then, or your mom has gotten tired of having to bribe you to not be an AH and doesn\u2019t know how to have that conversation with you.\n\nEither way, if you want money, you are now old enough to get a part-time job instead of harassing your mom.", "She spelled it out for you: it doesn\u2019t work like that. It\u2019s her money, she decides how it works.", "No, you\u2019re Ta for expecting your mother to just fork out 300 bucks at a moments notice. Instead of demanding all the money you think you\u2019re owed, maybe still down and have a conversation with her about what you expect and what can be realistically be done. You said in another comment you don\u2019t know her financial situation so you don\u2019t know if she can feasibly still pay you an allowance.", "Why would I be grateful that she supports me? That's the bare minimum, she'd be a bad parent if she didn't.", "Maybe parents should a little bit. Or you have this. I think kids should be taught something about money.", "If I'm promised something, I have every right to expect the promise to be carried out. Can I make it any simpler for you?", "I'm actually fine without 330 dollars as a 15 year old, shockingly enough. I'm more concerned about the fact that reddit seems to think its okay to just ditch promises like that. If she had talked to me and been reasonable, we'd have no issue and i wouldn't have posted this. It's the fact that she promised to make a commitment, and crumbled when I held her to it.", "So, the lesson I'm learning here is that I can just break a promise if I don't like it anymore. Is that right?", "I don't think it matters to OP if he has a roof over his head, as long as he gets his $300", "And if you lived with a bad parent you wouldn't be getting an allowance at all. Quit the temper tantrum.", "I think the best support your mum can give you right now is to put the parental controls back on the internet to save you from embarrassing yourself like this again.", "That\u2019s some big entitlement talking. You should be damn grateful you have a bed and food and a parent. Read this sub a little more - you have more than most. \n\nTime for a diaper change. You\u2019re acting like a big baby here", "Okay, so I snooped on your profile a little to get some more context of you, and taking into consideration autism it shows maybe you're not a total asshole, just struggling with the finite subtleties going on, idk how far into the spectrum you are/how much it effects you so apologies if this seems dumbed down at all, I just wanna cover all bases as I have friend on the spectrum and have had to have similar convos before with them.\n\nMuch like other comments have stated, your mother may be struggling financially and be unable to provide you the $15 dollars promised. Realistically, she should have sat you down, explained this, and requested as family that you still help out with chores to keep from her burden getting worse. That's on her most likely. Having said this, many parents feel a great deal of pride/shame depending on how much they can provide for their children. They don't enjoy admitting things are going bad if they are because they don't want to burden you with their adult troubles, yet at the end of the day they are just like you with struggles, ups and downs of life. Being an adult you think when younger you know all the answers because you're an adult and you should have that experience, but often times, you're the same mindset of when you're a teenager for the most part just trying to get by and winging it because nobody is there to help you anymore. Admitting to your kid your struggling puts pressure on the kid, and most will just hide it from them as a means to avoid upsetting the kid. \n\nYes, support from a parent is a bare minimum of what they do, but they sacrifice their free time and autonomy in doing so, not necessarily because they want to, but because they love you. Your mother doesn't need to offer you an allowance for chores, many households expect it for free. There are likely a lot of other luxuries you have such a TV, a pc, even your phone maybe that aren't a minimum, but she wants to provide to give you the best home life possible.\n\nAnother way at looking at it is like this, I consider the normal expectations in a friendship to be support, kindness, and help when needed to be mutually provided for eachother. When a friend helps me, despite it being expected they would help if they can, I will still be grateful that they spent their time going out of their way to aid me when they could have just not. Your mother could just.. Not. And even though you consider her current actions a minimum, she's still choosing to day in and day out look after you when she could just not.\n\nIn regards to the money, I'd reccomend having a conversation with her. Ask if your financial situations okay/anythings changed and if she needs help with anything extra (without charge). Ask when is an appropriate time to remind her of money in the future if things are okay, and ask what she'd like you to do if she does forget as you don't want to leave it till it's a massive 'bill' at the end. And lastly, say sorry to her. Expecting 'the bare minimum' without thanks is just ungreatful and you will be a jerk to your fellow peers and family if you can't recognise this because what's minimum to you, may be a great struggle to someone else. She's not a scammer, and saying that to your own mother over an allowance is cruel for you aren't entitled to it, even if there was a previous agreement as allowances are just bonuses, not minimums. And chores are expected with or without them.\n\nI hope this clears it up some.", "\u201cWe have to cut back in some areas\u201d is vastly different from involving them in discussions of financial hardship. No parent should be laying out on the table all finances for their kids as it leads to serious financial anxiety for kids.

There is a middle ground but actually explaining the full scope of financial hardship is something no one should be putting on a child.", "I think grown ups just understand priorities better than bratty kids, so I get why you're having trouble grasping this. She probably has to pay for rent, utilities, groceries, clothing, transportation, and piles of other bills that are going up and non negotiable.

If you want people to give you unconditional support, this is not the place to come.", "Apparently there are grownups here. We understand that being a grown-up is tough.

I cannot get over all of the Y T A votes! You had a deal in place. You\u2019ve been doing your part, and she just decided not to hold up her end without even discussing it with you.
