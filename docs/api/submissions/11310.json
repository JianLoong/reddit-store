And as an older non-neurotypical person, I'd like to give you a little advice.\nMoney with family and friends is always going to work differently than for work and business. Right now you're viewing this as a work transaction, where you've performed a task and expect payment. This is reasonable considering how it was presented to you in the beginning.\n\nThe thing is, a lack of money makes people uncomfortable, so they'll speak in pleasantries and code about it. When your mom brushed you aside with \"it's not the time or place,\" that was the code for \"I don't have it/it's not in the budget\", especially if you were in public, where having that conversation would be embarrassing.\n\nKeeping tabs on what a friend or relative owes you is seen as greedy or miserly. If you \"lend\" a friend who is struggling $20 every now and then, coming at them 6 months later with \"you owe me $60\" is going to make you lose that friend, as well as mutual friends.\n\nMy advice:\n1) apologize to your mom about calling her names\n2) make sure that when you talk to anyone you're related to or friends with about money owed between you, that it's in private.\n3) learn to let go of small debts from people you care about. Especially if it's been more than a month or two.\n4) caveat: don't lend money you can't afford to lose, and don't let yourself be taken advantage of. It's one thing to pony up some gas money or pay for a meal on occasion; it's quite another to always be the one who pays\n5) this does not apply to actual employers or other business transactions\n\nGood luck OP", "It's one thing to have a conversation about why allowance money has stopped, but to tell her you need backpay..\n\nBy the way, you're lucky to get an allowance at all, and after being called a scammer... that allowance would be on pause until further notice.\n\nMaybe your mom is going through a sudden financial struggle, and now their child is calling them a scammer and asking for more money. Think about how that sounds.\n\nEdit: changing to ESH\n\nOP sucks for being a brat. Mom sucks for not being more communicative.", "ESH. \n\nAn allowance is a privilege, and while yes, it does suck that she didn't hold up her end of the bargain, she probably couldn't afford to.

Allowance isn\u2019t just an earned thing. You have to consider the household finances too. The fact is?

A calm sit down may lead to your desired results, escalation will not. \n\nI will say that I was never given an allowance for the chores I did. It was just assumed as part of the household we all pitched in, my parents, myself and my sibling.\n\nHowever, I was also fortunate enough to live in a town where I had summer jobs so I learned how to earn and budget money separate from my parent\u2019s pocket. I don\u2019t know if this would have been different if I didn\u2019t have that opportunity. \n\nI do want to say that N T A for asking for the money but YTA for how you addressed the situation and the way you\u2019ve been insulting and arguing with others in the comments. \n\nBest of luck and I hope you\u2019re able to have a beneficial conversation with your mom soon.", "ESH.

INFO How long have you been getting an allowance? Was the payment on time before? I ask this because did you ever realize there might be financial issues your mother is struggling with and she can\u2019t afford to give you your allowance? She may not want you to worry.  I am not sure your age, but I think she should talk to you about budgeting and finances so you fathom how hard she may be having it right now. If she is just not keeping up with an agreement, well that isn\u2019t ok, BUT calling her a lying scum isn\u2019t ever a good idea. Why would you do this?", "YTA.

She's not setting a good example for you.\n\nYou should contribute to the household you live in regardless of whether you're paid or not. That's your duty as someone who lives there, not just something you do in exchange for money. And also you shouldn't speak to your mother like that.", "You get that you\u2019re not owed allowance, right? You\u2019re expected to contribute to the household you live in chore-wise regardless of getting compensation for it. Stop being a brat. Also, at 15 you\u2019re old enough to get a part time job. YTA", "You sweet summer child. \n\nBy all means when you enter the workforce, that is how things work but at home it\u2019s different. An allowance is a privilege. You\u2019re not entitled to it and you shouldn\u2019t expect to get one for simply taking care of the home you live in. \n\nSmall Yta cause you\u2019re still learning how the world works.", "Honestly a light ESH. \n\nYes your mom made an agreement with you which she has broken several times, and that's not right. If money was tight those weeks, she should have explained that to you, because you're old enough to know the harsher realities of life; sometimes $15 can literally make or break you, the difference between being able to get to work that week or afford the electric payment that month so it won't get shut off. Unfortunately that's a reality for many families, and something you will probably experience in the next 5-10 years. \n\nBut you should also not have kept a running tally of the 22 weeks she hasn't given you an allowance because if she has trouble paying $15 some weeks, there's no way she'd be able to just give you $330 at once. That's not realistic and it probably just makes your mom feel like a bad mother even if she wouldn't say that out loud. \n\nAlso if you really do want extra money for yourself, get a little part time job at a local store, or offer babysitting services. You should still be helping around the house though, allowance or not, because it teaches you to do those things for when you're one your own. Trust me I know plenty of people who got to college and didn't know how to clean, cook, do laundry, etc. And you need to know those things and how to do them properly.", "I think both of you are the asshole, but mostly your mom right now.  \nYour mom should be transparent about everything. She shouldn't have told you $15 per week for certain chores and then not paid when you did them. If she can't afford that or doesn't want to, she should have just made them required chores and set your allowance way lower or to nothing at all. I never gave my daughter an allowance and she is just expected to do chores throughout the week. If she doesn't then she loses priveleges like her tablet.  \nHowever she is still your mom and like others have pointed out you are living there for free and getting food and shelter. She doesn't owe you any money for that. Everyone - not just kids - need to stop acting like they're entitled to the world giving them more than they are already getting. Obviously your mom is either too flaky or can't afford to pay the money. So do your chores and if you need cash then find a side business like babysitting or lawn mowing or snow shoveling.", "YTA and given your attitude, you don\u2019t deserve an allowance.", "YTA and based on your responses, also an entitled brat and I can\u2019t wait for life to kick your ass.", "ESH\n\nYour mom should have stuck to the promise of 15 / wk allowance if that was the original promise. \n\nYou however sound like a spoiled brat, and I imagine in about 5 years you'll calm down and look back at this memory with some embarrassment and fondness. \n\nI don't know if you're aware, but most of us (adults) are gearing up for what looks like will be a pretty rough recession. Layoffs have already begun in certain industries. Your mom maybe struggling financially, or getting ready to weather the roughness of the recession by saving money. Should she have told you this? Yes. Making sure the household is secure financially is more important than you getting a bigmac after school. \n\nYour mom should not have broken the promise without telling you, but also you should understand that at any point she has the ability to break the promise and still be in the right. You are not entitled to a fifteen dollar a week allowance for doing chores, you should already be contributing to the house. \n\nTL:DR Kid is spoiled, but mom still should have told him.", "INFO: where is your father? Is your mother a single mom working to ensure everything else you need is covered?", "Yes, a bit of an asshole. \n\nYour mom is paying for house, food, electric, you name it. If she was flushed with cash, I'm sure your $15 would be paid promptly. I'm pretty sure she doesn't need you to remind her of this fact by your $330 comment. Money causes a lot of stress, she doesn't need that added to by you.\n\nAt your age, it's hard, but at some point you need to grow up. Consider everything she does pay for and consider what you can do to help her, instead of demanding what she can do for you.", "ESH\n\nShe's wrong to not pay what she agreed to. But. It's a bit unreasonable to just hit her with a huge bill, when you could have easily flagged to her when she forgot previously. It's kind of manipulative that you did that bc you obviously didn't forget. You may try to get something like $100 but I think you may need to kiss the bulk of it goodbye.\n\nEG if you don't cash a cheque for 6-12 months, it's no longer possible to cash it.\n\nI think you need to negotiate a middle ground.

She could say \"I know you've been getting an allowance, but it's not something I can keep doing right now. I know this is disappointing, but it's just the reality right now.\" Then you'd know where you stood instead of in this confusing place about the whole thing.

Call CPS and tell them your horrid tale, they'll laugh too.", "After reading some comments from redditors and from OP, I feel like everyone in this entire thread is acting a bit emotional. Let's break it out by points. This may be a controversial take but I hope it helps in some way:\n\n**- allowance payment:** at face value with info provided, OP and mom made an agreement to trade services for money (do x chores for $15/week). OP did those chores for 22 weeks ($330 total/$15 weekly = 22 weeks) with no payment. Mom did not hold up her end of the deal. To any \"adult\" on here who's telling this \"child\" it's his bedtime, would you be ok with it if your job did not pay you for 22 weeks? How many of you have lent money to someone and they \"promise\" to pay you back and never do? How well does that go over? Calling OP names does not make you look more mature, and we should understand where his frustrations are coming from.\n\n**-your mom might be struggling:** very possible, she needs to come forward and communicate that so y'all can change your agreement. OP, you need to be open to this communication and understand you may never get your allowance and accept that this as a possible outcome. This shouldn't be a \"me vs my mom\" it should be a \"us vs problem\" especially if this is the case. Your mom loves you and you love your mom, remember that.\n\n**- your house is your responsibility:** True, but this does not change the fact your mom promised you payment for chores and for 22 weeks she did not hold up her end. Plus, when you discussed it with her regularly for 22 weeks she refused to pay and now insinuates she will not pay you. That being said, she is your mom and has no obligation to pay you for chores. If you do have a discussion and it ends in the fact that you will have chores with no payment, you are living in her house under her rules and you need to respect that. You are a minor now, but when you move out and have your own place this will change. You're 15, we're talking 3 years away.\n\n**- name calling:** that was wrong of you to call her mom names. It most likely came from a place of high emotion because of the frustration/resentment building up over 22 weeks, but it was still wrong. I recommend you apologize for that (and mean it). If you do, it may be the opening to explain why you have felt so frustrated, to ask why isn't she holding up her end, and to explore what can y'all together do about it going forward. \n\n**- behavior/school work being up to standard:** was this ever a point of contingency on the chores agreement?

Realistically, she should have sat you down, explained this, and requested as family that you still help out with chores to keep from her burden getting worse. That's on her most likely. Having said this, many parents feel a great deal of pride/shame depending on how much they can provide for their children. They don't enjoy admitting things are going bad if they are because they don't want to burden you with their adult troubles, yet at the end of the day they are just like you with struggles, ups and downs of life. Being an adult you think when younger you know all the answers because you're an adult and you should have that experience, but often times, you're the same mindset of when you're a teenager for the most part just trying to get by and winging it because nobody is there to help you anymore. Admitting to your kid your struggling puts pressure on the kid, and most will just hide it from them as a means to avoid upsetting the kid. \n\nYes, support from a parent is a bare minimum of what they do, but they sacrifice their free time and autonomy in doing so, not necessarily because they want to, but because they love you. Your mother doesn't need to offer you an allowance for chores, many households expect it for free. There are likely a lot of other luxuries you have such a TV, a pc, even your phone maybe that aren't a minimum, but she wants to provide to give you the best home life possible.\n\nAnother way at looking at it is like this, I consider the normal expectations in a friendship to be support, kindness, and help when needed to be mutually provided for eachother. When a friend helps me, despite it being expected they would help if they can, I will still be grateful that they spent their time going out of their way to aid me when they could have just not. Your mother could just.. Not. And even though you consider her current actions a minimum, she's still choosing to day in and day out look after you when she could just not.\n\nIn regards to the money, I'd reccomend having a conversation with her. Ask if your financial situations okay/anythings changed and if she needs help with anything extra (without charge). Ask when is an appropriate time to remind her of money in the future if things are okay, and ask what she'd like you to do if she does forget as you don't want to leave it till it's a massive 'bill' at the end. And lastly, say sorry to her. Expecting 'the bare minimum' without thanks is just ungreatful and you will be a jerk to your fellow peers and family if you can't recognise this because what's minimum to you, may be a great struggle to someone else. She's not a scammer, and saying that to your own mother over an allowance is cruel for you aren't entitled to it, even if there was a previous agreement as allowances are just bonuses, not minimums. And chores are expected with or without them.\n\nI hope this clears it up some.", "\u201cWe have to cut back in some areas\u201d is vastly different from involving them in discussions of financial hardship.

Take this as a life lesson. Stop believing you\u2019re entitled to money for doing chores around the house. You should do chores because you live in that environment just as much as your mom does and you should keep it clean. You should do chores because at 15 years old you\u2019re learning the responsibilities that you will have as an adult and maintaining a clean home is just one small part of that.

Sorry you were promised an allowance that you did not receive. I get that it sucks, but honestly - get over it. You aren\u2019t entitled to it. Fix your attitude and give your mom a break.

You said yourself you didn\u2019t need the money so to give her grief to this extent and jump to her not being a person of integrity is mind boggling.

If I had never been promised compensation to begin with, well then there wouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\nThe issue here isn\u2019t money, it\u2019s communication and trust.\n\nEdit: assumed they were 15, removed age from comment", "They should when the alternative is teaching them that they can go back on a deal they now cannot commit to. There needs to be open communication, he is 15, not 5. \"If\" there are indeed money issues and that is the reason he deserves to know at least why the deal was altered. Bc again, what lesson are we teaching otherwise?", "He has one, $15 per week for doing chores, he just has a shit employer", "God there is a lot of assumptions in this thread for a aita, usually people are not this stupid lol.\n\nMaybe if she, idk, talked to her child, all of this wouldn't have been a problem!", "I agree.  We can do better.", "I'm fuckin trying", "I think they just meant that mom paying the bills is more important than mom paying OP an allowance.", "What? I'm sorry, but that's the silliest statement I've read today.\n\nYes, a parent MUST provide these things, in my opinion. If you can't, you most likely shouldn't have had kids. Situations change though, so you make the best out of a bad situation. \n\nBut what part of life should a kid not be grateful for things provided? My four year old, who has no concept of mortgages or electric bills, still is grateful for the cereal I buy for her, that she likes. \n\nI'm not over here drilling tax law into her, but I've raised her to throw a 'thank you dad' when provided things. Kind of entitled kid would I be raising if I told her to assume everything is owed to her.\n\nNot sure where 'dangled' is coming from - as if I'm saying pay up or your out of the house. Where did you elude this from what I wrote?\n\nKids do 'owe' their parents when you get down to it. It's why you have your kids help clean, to be polite, to perform well at school. You don't just throw goodies at them and let society work it out. Also an early teenager should have a concept of the life style being provided to them - if they don't a mistake was made at some point.\n\nBoy that's a lot of words. Regardless, there is no parents hand book that says you owe your kid cash money. If the parents are in a financial crisis, this is doubly so. To better understand why this is the case, explaining that paying for the roof, food, and electricity come first is a good place to start. Guess you can blame space aliens or Obama, but I'm one to believe a little dose of reality is good for a child.", ">I called her a lying scammer and walked off.\n\nThe 'why' never entered his head, hence the asshole part. She didn't scam and if financial reasons are the culprit, then throwing out some number like $330 (assuming she hasn't been able to pay him for 5 months, three weeks) should be a big red flag as to a problem.\n\nAlso it's worth noting, no parent starts a bribing system for 'doing choirs and **cooperating**\" if problems weren't present.\n\nShould she have told him \"I can't afford it\"? Yes, I believe so. Kid should also be able to deduct or be aware of problems mom is having, not simply worry what they're getting out of it too. Five months should be long enough to figure something is up.", "If you are old enough to be online you are old enough to contribute to the household chores, payment is a kind offer but absolutely not owed. You are a child that has no need for income", "Yeah and you can be a bad child for your crap attitude", "Ditch a promise. Dude, promises get broken alllll the time. Did she pinky promise you? Is that why you\u2019re taking this so hard.", "SO WHY ARE YOU EVEN ON HERE ASKING US IF YOUR MIND IS MADE UP FFS!!!", "\"I'm not embarrased at all. I've continued to use basic logic to show how stupid the average redditor is.

NTA. \n\nHowever, it sounds like your mom can\u2019t or won\u2019t give you the money. So, there\u2019s multiple ways to deal with that. You may of course be bitter and angry, but ultimately that won\u2019t help you. \n\nIf I were you I would 1) stop trusting your mom when she promises you things, or don\u2019t trust her to update you when a contract changes at least 2) don\u2019t expect money for your chores in the future, 3) start finding another way to make money. Mow lawns in your neighborhood on Saturdays, babysit, whatever you can do, and hide that money away.\n\nI would also be really upset if I was you. Honestly, I\u2019ve been there with my own parents. Totally valid. \n\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t decide what happens to you in life, but you can decide how you respond and what you do about it :)", "I will repeat what I said somewhere else. I assumed the average person here was smarter", "Who is in for a delightfully rude awakening.", "Think it's a combination of 'logical autistic brain thinking must be right because logic' failing to see social ques/missing an emotional mark, and not having anyone take the time to try help him out understanding the logic in people's emotional reactions.\n\nHas a post about people not liking him/being autistic so I think it's a deeper issue than just this post.", "This is the best form of birth control I never asked for.", "Your mom does have an obligation to provide for you. \n\nIf you were my kid, I would go to the bank and pull the $300. Then I would go to Verizon and cut your phone off, because you don't need a phone to live, and you can get some prepaid data with your chore money. \n\nParents should not make promises they can't keep, and they should be open and transparent with kids. But you're an entitled brat who has no clue how expensive it is to just keep you alive, fed, clothed, sheltered, and we'll enough to come act like a tool on Reddit. You don't deserve an allowance for helping around the house, you live there, you should be helping.", "I get the picture that you aren\u2019t seeing beyond your own limited experience. \n\nThink for a second, maybe your mom doesn\u2019t have the funds.

Yes promises are made but sometimes reality bites and I think you are failing to realize that.", "That's a bonus that many teenagers do not get in the first place. I don't know how common it is in the US, but most of the people I grew up with and teens I know in my family never got an allowance. It's simply not a thing; you get presents at your birthday and Christmas, a little bit of pocket money on the occasions when you go out with friends, and that's it. You're still expected to do your share of chores because that comes with sharing a living space, nothing more.\n\nNot saying you're a brat or entitled or spoiled, just giving some perspective as to why people might not commiserate.", "I said it because this is what OP seemingly expects. Regardless? Education about finances and a talk about financial hardship are two separate things. No parent should be involving their kids in a discussion about financial hardship when they are children.", "That was my bad.

But maybe instead of lashing out you can ask her if something is going on? From the sound of it she hasn\u2019t been giving you allowance for around 6 months. Has she always kept her promise before that?", "You asked for judgement, you got judgement. You don't get to argue that.", "As you can see 99% of people are telling you the same thing. That doesn\u2019t make it a stupid answer. Most of these people are also adults and have a better background in adulthood. Just listen to the answers if they\u2019re all saying the same thing.

Mom (single?) just went through covid which was likely a big problem for her finances. I think a talk about tightening the budget would not be out of the question.  I see so many 20 year olds without a clue about budgets. Of course it's something for parents to teach, at least basics.
