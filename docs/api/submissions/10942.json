Unfortunately, one of her coping mechanisms is to eat lots of comfort food to relax and calm herself. When I say lots, I mean like two large fries and two large burgers in one sitting several times a week.\n\nI am worried for her health, because she eats a lot of saturated fat and sodium rich foods, which is awful for her heart since she already has prehypertension and high cholesterol. I tried asking my girlfriend if I could help her destress in other ways like doing making hot baths for her, doing yoga with her, or cooking healthier versions of her favorite dishes at home, but she refuses all of my solutions and tells me to leave her alone.\n\nI also suggested that we go to a dietitian or that she discusses these issues with her therapist and/or PCP, but she got extremely mad at me over these suggestions. She refused to give me an explanation when I asked why she was so averse to getting help.\n\nIt\u2019s been really frustrating and depressing to see her become more unhealthy. She\u2019s lost her energy, gained weight, can\u2019t sleep properly, and is generally more irritable. Yesterday, she binged on four large fries after work and came up to me and started complaining about her stomach hurting (for the fifth time this week after a binge.) I told her we could go to the doctor, but she got mad at me immediately for suggesting that.\n\nI really lost it because it\u2019s like I can\u2019t suggest anything to help her because she\u2019ll just get mad at me. She started complaining about the pain again and I told her that \u201cmaybe you would feel better if you didn\u2019t eat so much junk.\u201d She started crying and screaming at me for \u201cfat-shaming and belittling her.\u201d AITA?", "created_utc": 1677386830, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11c5mkn/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_she_would/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I completely understand your position and it really sucks to see your partner harming themself and making bad decisions. Your suggestions only come from a place of love, and she should recognize how her addition (because binge eating *is* an addiction) is affecting you. That sounds really hard.\n\nTo give some advice that my therapist communicated to me, you can\u2019t beat an addition without first accepting it, and being at peace with it. She needs to acknowledge and embrace that binge eating feels *good,* and that she does it for very valid reasons. It brings her pleasure when life gets hard. Only after she reaches that mindset can she begin to seek and prioritize healthier alternatives. You pointing out her issue and making suggestions probably made the problem worse, despite your good intentions. What she needs right now is a therapist, and lots of good support from you. I think you can be loving and supportive while also communicating that what she\u2019s doing is making you feel sad and concerned. \n\nBest of luck OP!", "NTA. You are watching her give herself pain with food and refuse to address it. You should have seen the thread where the poor girl with IBS ate pizza one time (!) knowing it could make her sick, it did, and then her boyfriend was enraged that she had to cancel plans to see his mommy and everyone was on his side. Because people want to see fat phobia in your actions here, you\u2019re being vilified. Your gf has a pattern of harming herself with food, it\u2019s making both of your lives worse, and people just want you to enable her. She is binge eating, complaining about pain, and attacking you for suggesting so many kind things (cooking for her, suggesting someone to talk to that isn\u2019t you, etc.). Don\u2019t listen to these people. You have approached this issue with love. If she doesn\u2019t want to address her disorder, don\u2019t feel bad for leaving.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA. She\u2019s eating herself to death and it\u2019s no different than someone drinking themself to death or using drugs. It has nothing to do with fat shaming contrary to what some folks here say.", "NTA \n\nYou tried to suggest better ways for her to destress and suggested she speak with a professional. \n\nShe\u2019s eating a lot of food and then complaining, literally a \u2018consequences of her actions\u2019 moment. She definitely needs some help to manage her stress and binging, but you can\u2019t make her. Only she can take care of herself.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you said anything super rude or out of line. It\u2019s natural to be concerned about this behavior as it is objectively binge eating (I say this as someone with a history of bulimia). But unfortunately your gf is an adult and has to seek out help herself. There\u2019s probably a lot more going on in her head that you don\u2019t know about, so I would give her some space and just keep reiterating that if she\u2019s in pain, she should go see a doctor, rather than make it about her eating habits (that probably is a cause but let her doctor tell her that).", "Soft NTA. it sounds an lot like binge eating disorder, your partner is obviously soothing with food and until she acknowledges this is a problem she\u2019s going to think of what you say as an attack on her. Shame is a big part of eating disorders, she eats a lot feels guilty and ashamed which in turn causes her to feel worse about herself and the cycle starts again. \nWhile your concern is coming from a good place all your approach of suggesting she eat healthier meals and be more active is likely adding to the shame she\u2019s likely already feeling. She needs professional help which you can\u2019t give her, what you can give her is support. \n\nI would reach out to her family and discuss your concerns. Don\u2019t make it about her weight or about the types of food she eats being \u201cunhealthy\u201d. Discuss the problem which is the binge eating, your concerns about her having an eating disorder and figure out a way to help her get the help she needs. Best of luck to you.", "NTA", "NTA. Your girlfriend is not just eating a little bit of junk food. She is binge eating. I cannot imagine polishing off four large fries in one setting. \n\nBinge eating disorder is a very real eating disorder. I\u2019m sorry your girlfriend is going through a stressful time, but your concerns are valid.", "I was on the fence until the part about four large fries and then coming to OP for sympathy for her stomach ache. Can\u2019t ask to be left alone and then go on to to complain. NTA.", "I'm an emotional eater. I used to be okay because I salsa danced like 4 nights a week and went tonthe gym. But then I was attacked, developed severe depression, and ptsd.  All the meds coupled with being stalked caused me to gain a lot of weight. Fast forward 10 years. Even after a decade of therapy I am only now taking that 1st step to get physically better but I've had to handle a lot of different trauma first. \n\nClearly something is going on. She needs help but she's going to have to be the one that takes that step, just like me. It helps that I have a loving, supportive wife who doesn't judge me on my bad days and cheers me on during my good ones. \n\nI'm hoping this new injectable medication coupled with therapy helps me look at and treat food differently.\n\nEdit to add... I sincerely hope she gets the help she needs.", "OP she's not going to get help until she admits that she needs it.  Nothing you say, her therapist, her PCP, no one.  She hasn't hit rock bottom to do that yet.  It's just like someone who has a drinking problem won't go to AA until they're forced to because they were arrested with multiple DUI's and they're court mandated to avoid jail time.  You said yourself that you can't suggest anything because she'll get mad at you, so don't.  You can speak with a therapist on how you can deal with your feelings, but in the end you're going to have to distance yourself from the situation.  You can't fix someone who doesn't want you to save them.", "NTA - You just want her to be healthy, what she's doing right now is really bad for. The fact that you offered to make a healthier version of the food she likes at home was very sweet and considerate. You  even tried to talk her into trying other, healthier, ways to cope with stress. (I hope she feels better.)", "NTA, *but* you\u2019ve said your piece. Let it go now. Tell her you\u2019re there to talk to or help her when she\u2019s ready. Then don\u2019t mention it again.", "NTA. You tried in every way you can to help her. But she does not want your help. She is going to have to help herself and there is not anything else you can do to help her. If she complains about her stomach or anything else related to this be empathetic like saying you're sorry that she is having stomach pain but stop making suggestions to help her as it just makes her mad. Of if you can not deal with her in this situation you can always break up.", "NTA. This is super toxic behavior. Both on the part of her binge eating to relieve stress and find comfort and in her reactions toward you when you try to suggest options. I've dealt with women in the past that exhibited the same behavior. Idk how long you've been together, but I'd seek to address this gaslighting asap or start looking at moving on. You're only putting your own mental health in jeopardy.", "From just what you posted... NTA, but this isn't going to work out. If she cant take care of herself and you aren't serious, then it might be time to cut your losses.", "Info: how long has this been going on?", "NTA - aside from the food issue, I'm more concerned about the state of your relationship.\n\nYour GF is stressed and is coping in a way that is incongruent with how you handle your stress by binge eating.  \n\nShe's incommunicative, her behavior frustrates and depresses you.  She has less energy, she can't sleep, she's irritable.  She complains about the effects of her behavior but doesn't have enough self-awareness to see she's causing her complaint.  \n\nYou don't feel like you can suggest anything.  Any attempts to help her - she pushes her anger/blame on you.  \n\nThis is just me - but I would probably end the relationship.  She sounds really unhappy and she doesn't seem to emotionally or mentally be \"in\" your relationship.  She's not acting like a partner.  She's not trying to help herself.  \n\nI work really hard to be emotionally and physically healthy - I'm not interested in being with someone who is not.  That may sound harsh - but I've done the \"uneven\" partnership and it's a fucking slog and extremely unrewarding.  I might get marked down by everyone but hopefully, OP, you read this comment and you know that it's okay to end this situation and find someone who is joyful, healthy, happy and self-aware.  Good luck.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t up to you to fix. Girlfriend needs a therapist and a gym membership.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been a great boyfriend and tried every possible way to help her and she\u2019s gotten upset at you for that. Then she comes complaining to you about the result of her actions and gets upset when you offer solutions. She\u2019s not only become more of a slob and likely killed your attraction to her but she\u2019s just generally an awful girlfriend. I think it\u2019s time for you to cut your losses. You could be living a much better life right now. It\u2019s not on you to fix her. She has to fix herself. Relationships would work so much better if it operated as you holding yourself accountable rather than having to \u201csave\u201d each other.", "ESH.  Clearly there's an unhealthy food relationship happening for her and possibly a full blown eating disorder.

Your gf might not see the same problem though and is coming to you to listen and hear her out, not for solutions\n\nIt sounds like she's stressed and overwhelmed, she's being a bit of an AH to you, but that's probably just insecurities and the stress, she's not approaching the situation in a healthy way, but that's more common than you think.\n\nJust try and support her more, start cooking some healthy meals for you both, talk to her and LISTEN to her poblems and work through it together. Start suggesting some activities you both like that will destress and bring some joy into your lives. \n\nIf you just keep banging on about being unhealthy and everything you want to do is about being healthier when you were never like that before she'll pi k up on it and you will be TA,l.", "NTA, but she did ask you to not bring it up. I'd recommend not talking about it for a bit.", "I feel like this is going to be one of those sit downs that goes somewhere along the lines of. \"I love you, and I'm only trying to help you. If you really don't want that help, I'll stop. But you asking me to stop is also asking me to stand by and helplessly watch someone I love dearly continue to intentionally hurt themselves over and over again and that's not healthy for you OR me. So, tell me... what do you want me to do here?\"\n\nNAH - You're not for being frustrated at feeling helpless. She's not for being unwell in many ways and not being able to handle it.

I'm pretty sure she is already aware that her diet is not the healthiest thing in the world.\n\nYou need to be able to trust that she will bring up her overeating issues with her doctor and therapist when she feels comfortable doing so. Making snide remarks like \"maybe you would feel better if you didn\u2019t eat so much junk\" aren't productive.\n\nAlso, her loss of energy and good mood may not be because of her diet. She sounds like she is having some mental health issues that cause the change in diet, not the other way around.", "YTA Stop trying to fix her and listen. If you listen past when she says she hurts instead of trying to fix things, she might open up. You are food-shaming her, which will drive her further into it and deepen her depression.

Please tell her you're there for her because your other crap isn't helpful, in fact, it's harmful.", "Kinda both and this comes from a bigger girl. It honestly sounds a lot like anxiety/depression.

Good luck.", "You are unable to change another person\u2019s behavior. When you offer solutions without another person\u2019s consent you are not being helpful. The only thing you can do is to gently express your concern and then set boundaries for yourself. You\u2019ve already expressed your concern, so now think about what boundaries you need to set for yourself. \n\nYTA for making her stress about you. She did not ask for your help and yet you continue to force it on her. You need to take a bunch of steps back and work on yourself.", "Nta. You have no future with someone who will kill themselves all for the sake of tasty num-nums and scrumptious treats. This problem will never go away. Better to cut your losses", "ESH\n\nAgainst the grain but two things. First, what at work is causing her stress and does it seem endless? If it does, you could talk to her about helping her find a less stressful job. I have had a lot of jobs that stressed me out and it wasn't a job where anything important was on the line. It was just the neverending changing quotas and stats.\n\nSecond, she seems to be generally going through a crisis. I do the same things she does. I eat unhealthy because when I have a moment to sit and eat, I want something that kicks that endorphin part of my brain. Routine and stress management are the only ways to change that. For routine my fianc\u00e9 often makes me a bagel for breakfast and then I drink water through the day and make dinner when I get home. Stress management is spending time with my partner, playing a game, drawing or watching The Office.\n\nBut stop trying to fix the problem because you are offering bandaids to the underlying issue. She is stressed and probably depressed.", "She needs professional help, this isn\u2019t something you can fix with a bath. Get her to a point where she will accept that if you can. A frank conversation about your concerns and your fears for her may persuade her to seek the help she needs. If you can\u2019t persuade her you will need to involve family members that are closest to her. This is a last ditch effort when nothing else works. it may cause resentment and loss of trust but she can\u2019t continue this way as it could easily have severe impact on her long term health. Good luck and NTA for your concerns.", "Thing is, op can talk and talk but she will feel butthurt and eat even more. Goin to therapy is also stressful. So she eats more. You can't get through that hard head unless she takes meds first to stop the \"overstimulated mind\". She is stressed and likes food, but what if op tells her they go to the sports club and as a reward they get a hot shower instead of a huge meal", "He's having to listen to her bitch when she over eats and ends up with abdominal pain....3 times in one week. This isn't even about her weight. It's about her refusing to get any help from anyone and wallowing in her own pity and dragging him down with her. She has a therapist but refuses to discuss it with the therapist. She also refuses to deal with the stress at work. At soem point you can't deal with that anymore as a partner. You watch your SO suffer and refusing any and all help is frustrating. And it sounds like it has been going on for months. He's allowed to have his breaking point as well with no end in sight", "And then tell her therapist? That's going to be so unproductive. If she's not ready to speak about then she's not ready to start doing the work.", "So what\u2019s he supposed to do? She got extremely mad at him for suggesting she speak to her therapist or doctor. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want these suggestions she needs to stop whining about the impact of her choices.", "He\u2019s supposed to be there for her, be a boyfriend, be a comfort\u2026 wait for *her* to come to *him*. Not try and treat this as a \u201cjunk food problem\u201d?! \n\nHaving this black and white \u201cstop whining\u201d attitude is completely insensitive.", "She is coming to him though. And then she\u2019s complaining about the response.", "She\u2019s been coming to him about her stomach pain\u2026 that\u2019s the chance for OP to be a comfort. Circling back to my previous comment- it isn\u2019t another chance for OP to treat this as a \u201cjunk food problem\u201d.", "His response was to talk to health professionals about her pain. \n\nThat is a completely appropriate response to your partner complaining about frequent pain.", "NTA\n\nI see a lot of posts here where the OP is asked for help on health topics, and when the OP tells them to \u201cbe and eat healthier\u201d, they get called a \u201cfat-shamer\u201d.\n\nCause and Effect: her bad food habits WILL cause issues, and the only way to get Reid of the effect is to remove the Cause", "Nta, it seems your gf has a Binge disorder and that's concerning.\n\nHowever, she needs a therapist that specializes in eating disorders, it's I'll advised to go to a dietitian without seeing a mental health professional first (I'm a dietitian, btw).\n\nI suggest you to visit a therapist yourself so you get ideas on how to help her indirectly. It could be the case that your gf is NOT ready to accept she has /is on the way to have an eating disorder, and in that case, you'll Have to make decisions about this relationship. Best of luck", "I gave up smoking last year and have gained so much weight it's a shame. I have always had a sweet tooth and often chose to eat junk instead of the healthy food I know I should eat (given I already had one heart attack). I just wish my partner was as supportive as you. He will chose to eat a takeaway rather than help me out by eating something healthy to help encourage me\n\nNTA", "Nta but walk away its not gonna get any better. You can't help people who don't want to be helped.", "NTA\n\nThis is a problem with so many people. They hurt themselves with food, complain about being hurt, and then when someone points out that it's their own fault, they accuse them of fat-shaming.\n\nThey don't complain for want of a solution. They just want someone to say, \"Aw, that sucks, I hate that. Are you okay? What do you need?\"\n\nIt's unhealthy and annoying.\n\nAt the same time, it's also a big problem for themselves. Eating disorders or mental health issues that tie in with their diet/how they look after themselves, are so difficult to fix. It's like an addiction, something they go to every day and fall back on when they're feeling low.\n\nBut no one can fix that problem except her. And first she needs to accept that it's a problem.", "NTA it won't get better, my buddies wife if just killing herself with food and won't listen to anyone but her church leader about it. His explanation, \"she hasn't had any kids yet and that's why she's sad\" but she's over 300lbs so having a kid would kill her. It's a fun little cycle that will have my friend back on the dating scene in a few years one way or the other", "NTA. Your GF needs help, though, professional, medical help.\n\nI was the same as your GF, and it took me a trip to the emergency room to change my eating habits and help cope with a healthier outlook and change in lifestyle. (Profesional help is very, very professional and beneficial in my case)\n\nI honestly hope your GF gets the help she needs. Also I'm sorry you were put in the same situation I put my family through before that ER trip.", "Just so you know, you can call her therapist and give them information which you think is important and a concern. They can\u2019t discuss anything with you but they can listen to something serious affecting their patient which isn\u2019t being disclosed to them. If they have awareness then they can lead the conversation round towards the topic in a way where your Gf can talk about it and think it\u2019s her choice to do so. \n\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be overstepping to do this. She sounds very unhappy, she\u2019s engaging in binge eating behaviours which can be very difficult to break and she\u2019s using it to control stress except it\u2019s causing her pain, embarrassment, shame and health issues already and this is just the start unless she gets help to stop. I don\u2019t think she can stop without proper professional help if this is her coping mechanism. She\u2019s actively refusing to try any positive or healthier stress management tools, that\u2019s an indicator that this is really a problem and not a short blip in her life. \n\n\nI\u2019d call her doctor and tell them what you have observed and her responses. This isn\u2019t fat shaming, it\u2019s genuine concern for her welfare.", "She has already said no to telling her therapist, so I can\u2019t see him going behind her back turning out well for their relationship. If someone isn\u2019t motivated to change, they won\u2019t change. All he can do is be a support to her when she is ready to change, and in the mean time, look after his own mental health.\n\nNTA", "Calling her therapist or her doctor would be massively overstepping and a breach of trust. She is an adult and the one paying for these services.", "I agree but at this point she isn\u2019t making good choices. She\u2019s refusing to tell her therapist about an unhealthy pattern of behaviour which she is also refusing to tackle any other way. The physical discomfort will only grow and the longer she leaves it, the harder it is to treat if this is a binge eating disorder. If you love someone you make the best choices for them, even if that means speaking up about harmful behaviour that they are ashamed of and trying to hide. There\u2019s also the damage to her self image and esteem as she grows bigger from her eating habits, the financial cost of all the food then buying new clothing which fits and the physical discomfort will get worse. I\u2019d argue that telling her therapist and letting them decide what to do is the kindest and most loving thing to do for her right now. She\u2019s not OK, she needs help, she must be in real distress and she has access to proper professional help already with an established relationship with this therapist. He doesn\u2019t have to tell his GF even but at least this way there\u2019s a chance of her getting help. Right now she\u2019s ashamed of herself but she can\u2019t stop and she\u2019s refusing to let Op help her. She\u2019s not making good choices and her reluctance to let her doctor know suggests that this is already deep rooted and happening for a reason and without support and help she can\u2019t get better. Better to do this now than in six months when she\u2019s ballooned in weight and struggling to look in the mirror while binge eating in secret."]}
