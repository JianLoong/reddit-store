I completely understand your position and it really sucks to see your partner harming themself and making bad decisions. Your suggestions only come from a place of love, and she should recognize how her addition (because binge eating *is* an addiction) is affecting you. That sounds really hard.\n\nTo give some advice that my therapist communicated to me, you can\u2019t beat an addition without first accepting it, and being at peace with it. She needs to acknowledge and embrace that binge eating feels *good,* and that she does it for very valid reasons. It brings her pleasure when life gets hard. Only after she reaches that mindset can she begin to seek and prioritize healthier alternatives. You pointing out her issue and making suggestions probably made the problem worse, despite your good intentions. What she needs right now is a therapist, and lots of good support from you. I think you can be loving and supportive while also communicating that what she\u2019s doing is making you feel sad and concerned. \n\nBest of luck OP!", "NTA. You are watching her give herself pain with food and refuse to address it. You should have seen the thread where the poor girl with IBS ate pizza one time (!) knowing it could make her sick, it did, and then her boyfriend was enraged that she had to cancel plans to see his mommy and everyone was on his side. Because people want to see fat phobia in your actions here, you\u2019re being vilified. Your gf has a pattern of harming herself with food, it\u2019s making both of your lives worse, and people just want you to enable her. She is binge eating, complaining about pain, and attacking you for suggesting so many kind things (cooking for her, suggesting someone to talk to that isn\u2019t you, etc.). Don\u2019t listen to these people. You have approached this issue with love. If she doesn\u2019t want to address her disorder, don\u2019t feel bad for leaving.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA. She\u2019s eating herself to death and it\u2019s no different than someone drinking themself to death or using drugs. It has nothing to do with fat shaming contrary to what some folks here say.", "NTA \n\nYou tried to suggest better ways for her to destress and suggested she speak with a professional. \n\nShe\u2019s eating a lot of food and then complaining, literally a \u2018consequences of her actions\u2019 moment. She definitely needs some help to manage her stress and binging, but you can\u2019t make her. Only she can take care of herself.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you said anything super rude or out of line. It\u2019s natural to be concerned about this behavior as it is objectively binge eating (I say this as someone with a history of bulimia). But unfortunately your gf is an adult and has to seek out help herself. There\u2019s probably a lot more going on in her head that you don\u2019t know about, so I would give her some space and just keep reiterating that if she\u2019s in pain, she should go see a doctor, rather than make it about her eating habits (that probably is a cause but let her doctor tell her that).", "Soft NTA. it sounds an lot like binge eating disorder, your partner is obviously soothing with food and until she acknowledges this is a problem she\u2019s going to think of what you say as an attack on her. Shame is a big part of eating disorders, she eats a lot feels guilty and ashamed which in turn causes her to feel worse about herself and the cycle starts again. \nWhile your concern is coming from a good place all your approach of suggesting she eat healthier meals and be more active is likely adding to the shame she\u2019s likely already feeling. She needs professional help which you can\u2019t give her, what you can give her is support. \n\nI would reach out to her family and discuss your concerns. Don\u2019t make it about her weight or about the types of food she eats being \u201cunhealthy\u201d. Discuss the problem which is the binge eating, your concerns about her having an eating disorder and figure out a way to help her get the help she needs. Best of luck to you.", "NTA", "NTA. Your girlfriend is not just eating a little bit of junk food. She is binge eating. I cannot imagine polishing off four large fries in one setting. \n\nBinge eating disorder is a very real eating disorder. I\u2019m sorry your girlfriend is going through a stressful time, but your concerns are valid.", "I was on the fence until the part about four large fries and then coming to OP for sympathy for her stomach ache. Can\u2019t ask to be left alone and then go on to to complain. NTA.", "I'm an emotional eater. I used to be okay because I salsa danced like 4 nights a week and went tonthe gym. But then I was attacked, developed severe depression, and ptsd.  All the meds coupled with being stalked caused me to gain a lot of weight. Fast forward 10 years. Even after a decade of therapy I am only now taking that 1st step to get physically better but I've had to handle a lot of different trauma first. \n\nClearly something is going on. She needs help but she's going to have to be the one that takes that step, just like me. It helps that I have a loving, supportive wife who doesn't judge me on my bad days and cheers me on during my good ones. \n\nI'm hoping this new injectable medication coupled with therapy helps me look at and treat food differently.", "OP she's not going to get help until she admits that she needs it.  Nothing you say, her therapist, her PCP, no one.  She hasn't hit rock bottom to do that yet.  It's just like someone who has a drinking problem won't go to AA until they're forced to because they were arrested with multiple DUI's and they're court mandated to avoid jail time.  You said yourself that you can't suggest anything because she'll get mad at you, so don't.  You can speak with a therapist on how you can deal with your feelings, but in the end you're going to have to distance yourself from the situation.  You can't fix someone who doesn't want you to save them.", "NTA - You just want her to be healthy, what she's doing right now is really bad for. The fact that you offered to make a healthier version of the food she likes at home was very sweet and considerate. You  even tried to talk her into trying other, healthier, ways to cope with stress. (I hope she feels better.)", "NTA, *but* you\u2019ve said your piece. Let it go now. Tell her you\u2019re there to talk to or help her when she\u2019s ready. Then don\u2019t mention it again.", "NTA. You tried in every way you can to help her. But she does not want your help. She is going to have to help herself and there is not anything else you can do to help her. If she complains about her stomach or anything else related to this be empathetic like saying you're sorry that she is having stomach pain but stop making suggestions to help her as it just makes her mad. Of if you can not deal with her in this situation you can always break up.", "NTA. This is super toxic behavior. Both on the part of her binge eating to relieve stress and find comfort and in her reactions toward you when you try to suggest options. I've dealt with women in the past that exhibited the same behavior. Idk how long you've been together, but I'd seek to address this gaslighting asap or start looking at moving on. You're only putting your own mental health in jeopardy.", "From just what you posted... NTA, but this isn't going to work out. If she cant take care of herself and you aren't serious, then it might be time to cut your losses.", "Info: how long has this been going on?", "NTA - aside from the food issue, I'm more concerned about the state of your relationship.\n\nYour GF is stressed and is coping in a way that is incongruent with how you handle your stress by binge eating.  \n\nShe's incommunicative, her behavior frustrates and depresses you.  She has less energy, she can't sleep, she's irritable.  She complains about the effects of her behavior but doesn't have enough self-awareness to see she's causing her complaint.  \n\nYou don't feel like you can suggest anything.  Any attempts to help her - she pushes her anger/blame on you.  \n\nThis is just me - but I would probably end the relationship.  She sounds really unhappy and she doesn't seem to emotionally or mentally be \"in\" your relationship.  She's not acting like a partner.  She's not trying to help herself.  \n\nI work really hard to be emotionally and physically healthy - I'm not interested in being with someone who is not.  That may sound harsh - but I've done the \"uneven\" partnership and it's a fucking slog and extremely unrewarding.  I might get marked down by everyone but hopefully, OP, you read this comment and you know that it's okay to end this situation and find someone who is joyful, healthy, happy and self-aware.  Good luck.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t up to you to fix. Girlfriend needs a therapist and a gym membership.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been a great boyfriend and tried every possible way to help her and she\u2019s gotten upset at you for that. Then she comes complaining to you about the result of her actions and gets upset when you offer solutions. She\u2019s not only become more of a slob and likely killed your attraction to her but she\u2019s just generally an awful girlfriend. I think it\u2019s time for you to cut your losses. You could be living a much better life right now. It\u2019s not on you to fix her. She has to fix herself. Relationships would work so much better if it operated as you holding yourself accountable rather than having to \u201csave\u201d each other.", "ESH.  Clearly there's an unhealthy food relationship happening for her and possibly a full blown eating disorder. Not seeking help for it is problematic, but the way you describe your attempts to intervene sound bloody awful and triggering as hell.", "NAH\n\nIf you're approaching it the way you say you are and you're not being heavy handed and talking about it non stop then you're just trying to find solutions to the problem. Your gf might not see the same problem though and is coming to you to listen and hear her out, not for solutions\n\nIt sounds like she's stressed and overwhelmed, she's being a bit of an AH to you, but that's probably just insecurities and the stress, she's not approaching the situation in a healthy way, but that's more common than you think.\n\nJust try and support her more, start cooking some healthy meals for you both, talk to her and LISTEN to her poblems and work through it together. Start suggesting some activities you both like that will destress and bring some joy into your lives. \n\nIf you just keep banging on about being unhealthy and everything you want to do is about being healthier when you were never like that before she'll pi k up on it and you will be TA,l.", "NTA, but she did ask you to not bring it up. I'd recommend not talking about it for a bit.", "I feel like this is going to be one of those sit downs that goes somewhere along the lines of. \"I love you, and I'm only trying to help you. If you really don't want that help, I'll stop. But you asking me to stop is also asking me to stand by and helplessly watch someone I love dearly continue to intentionally hurt themselves over and over again and that's not healthy for you OR me. So, tell me... what do you want me to do here?\"\n\nNAH - You're not for being frustrated at feeling helpless. She's not for being unwell in many ways and not being able to handle it. The situation sucks but it'll all come down to one thing. She needs to want to help herself before you can help her. If she doesn't want that help, you can't force it without serious fallout.", "I feel like we\u2019re not getting the whole story or your girlfriend is super insecure.\n\nThink we might get a different story from the other side of this convo.", "YTA\n\nYou do seem to come from a place of caring, but she is an able-minded adult. I'm pretty sure she is already aware that her diet is not the healthiest thing in the world.\n\nYou need to be able to trust that she will bring up her overeating issues with her doctor and therapist when she feels comfortable doing so. Making snide remarks like \"maybe you would feel better if you didn\u2019t eat so much junk\" aren't productive.\n\nAlso, her loss of energy and good mood may not be because of her diet. She sounds like she is having some mental health issues that cause the change in diet, not the other way around.", "YTA Stop trying to fix her and listen. If you listen past when she says she hurts instead of trying to fix things, she might open up. You are food-shaming her, which will drive her further into it and deepen her depression. She doesn't feel emotionally and mentally safe talking to you about the cause. People with binge eating issues aren't going to get help until they're ready. Please tell her you're there for her because your other crap isn't helpful, in fact, it's harmful.", "Kinda both and this comes from a bigger girl. It honestly sounds a lot like anxiety/depression. I do NOT think you handled it well when you said that. Of course that hurt her. But it does sound like she\u2019s having a problem of some sort, not bc of the eating or her size but bc of how\u2019s she been acting recently.
