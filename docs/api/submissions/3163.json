You don't actually know for sure he did it you just think he did.... so you are slandering him. Thing to consider Neighbourhood teens might well of done it. It's the sort of things that kid stupidly do. Maybe a neighbour has gotten fed up with seeing the couch and got petty. There are a whole host of explanation that don't include Nate being involved.\n\nThe man had been drinking made your MIL squeal I can imagine another reason why he had a grin on his face...as can most others probably.\n\nYou have now decided to hijacked your MIL  thanks giving dinner.... Again on a supposition...Again what did you expect her to do...throw her husband out for something he says he didn't do\n\nQuite frankly From your description you sound like a nightmare and it's speaks well of them that they haven't kicked you out and told you to sort yourselves out\n\nYou sound massively bratty and entitled actually.

I doubled down and would not say it until they made me. I was 3 THREE. \n\nIt\u2019s not okay to get drunk at make fun of someone in their own home. You say you can\u2019t trust them, well how can they trust you or your husband. You expect MIL to stand up for you, but you didn\u2019t do that for Nate when your husband was insulting him. You don\u2019t get along so insults are not funny they are insulting. \n\nAll of you are terrible for arguing about a couch. Maybe you could have stored in the bedroom or a garage. Or maybe ask the people who sold you the couch to keep it for you when you move. \n\nMost adults don\u2019t just want some random couch just dropped off in their living room. Not only does it crowd things and mess up the decore but some hace bed bugs, fleas etc. I definitely would not want it inside my living room.

That said, you don\u2019t know what happened to the couch.

You should act like a guest.", "YTA You brought a couch to their home, why on earth should they store it inside for you. You are already taking up too much space in their home. Yes, your couch outside will look trashy and will deteriorate rapidly. Looks like your husband was being annoying and MIL's husband retaliated. Now you are sulking in your room, but eating her food.
