My in laws moved in from another country to help care for the boy for a few months. My wife and her family have rigid adherence to routine, and spontaneity brings them stress. After the first week I volunteer to take the night shift, so I'm sleeping during the day and feeding/changing at night. We agreed that I would defer to my wife about decisions about the baby.\n\nI didn't have an instant bond with our son. I gather this is common for a new father, and that a bond will come in time. On occasion I feel a spike of affection and ask to hold the boy. Each time the boy fussed during the handoff and right away my wife has told me to give him back to MIL (who is the best at calming him). I told her it really bothers me that she doesn't give me a chance, and while she doesn't fully understand the nuance of my feelings, she gets the gist.\n\nA few nights ago, I once again asked to hold my son. My MIL hands him over without objection, and when the boy fusses during the hand off my wife jumps in and tells me to give him back right away. I'm very frustrated because I thought she wouldn't do this again, plus it's making it much harder for me to build a bond with the boy. Then, I go to tell my wife in another room that I think it's not cool that she keeps doing this, and she tells me that she doesn't want the boy to cry and I'm disrupting the routine. I tell her I should be able to hold him even if he cries because I'm his father, plus I need practice anyway. She responds with saying I should schedule a time to hold him so that it fits into their routine, and she offered to take some videos of MIL calming the boy so I could learn from her technique. I know she genuinely doesn't mean any harm, is influenced by her emotions, and is trying to do what's best for the boy despite being stressed. But **I felt so insulted and furious at this**. My take is that she doesn't trust my skill or judgment even though I've demonstrated good judgment and high competence for years.\n\nI told her I thought it was bullshit but didn't yell, then went to do my night shift. I don't have strong feelings for the boy. I know it sounds cold, and I'm sorry, but I need to be honest. And I am unwilling to fight the boy's mother for access to him. She takes excellent care of him, and they treat me like a nuisance. I'm frankly not needed. This probably sounds like I'm being petty, but my original intentions were to spend extra effort to push myself to develop warm and fuzzy feelings towards our baby, but now I don't want to do that. If they develop it can be slowly and naturally over time. Wife and in laws can overwhelm the baby with hugs and kisses and I will just stay out of the way. I still will fulfill my responsibilities 100%.\n\nSo AITA for stopping my \"extra effort\" at bonding?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA:\n\n(1) Me \"deferring\" to my wife when it comes to decisions about babies is a cultural thing.\n\n(2) I'd gladly fight against the world for him, but not against his own mother (assuming she's not abusive, of course).\n\n(2.1) It's absolutely NOT spite. I don't want to fight against his mother. I was pushing myself to be with my son, because I don't currently feel a craving to be with him, and thought it was what I was supposed to do, figuring I'd develop that craving over time. I don't want to push myself further because I'd have to fight against the boy's mother to do so. She is a good mother, he gets excellent care. I will not abandon them, I am certain I will eventually grow to have feelings for him over the months and years ahead. I simply don't want to fight his mother to accelerate it.\n\n(3) Please chill about \"the boy\". It's a playful thing that I developed with my wife before he was born that comes from the Simpsons, and she's fine with it. It's harmless, I'm not a psycho, I just didn't know realize it would freak people out.

Your wife is a huge AH. Don't let her dictate how you can interact with your own son.", "YWBTA if you transfer your annoyance at your wife, to your newborn son. None of this is his fault, so to throw your hands in the air and refuse to bond with him would make you a major AH. \n\nAlso, you don\u2019t need to \u2018defer\u2019 to your wife regarding your son. You went 50/50 in creating him, so you can go 50/50 on decisions pertaining to him.", "NTA. That is your son and it sounds like your wife and MIL are controlling everything with zero regard to your input. Routines can be helpful but this isn't just routine--these are controlling people. Personally, I think it's really weird to not let a father hold his baby because the baby might cry. Babies are going to cry anyway! This is not a healthy situation. I don't blame you for not feeling a bond since you're being excluded from the child-raising process and basically are being told you're not allowed or trusted to take care of him or even hold him.\n\nYou'll want to do something about this as soon as you can, in any way you can. You need to appeal to the mother of your child. If you give up now, you've basically given up for good and the kid is the one who is really going to suffer for it. I don't care what culture people are from, you can't just ban the other parent of your child from having access to them (unless of course they're abusive or irresponsible).\n\nPut your foot down and communicate with your wife. You're not a glorified sperm donor so you shouldn't be treated like one. Remind her that you are the father and get half a say in caring for and holding the child. If she refuses to listen, then you'll have to explore whatever options you're left with.", "NTA. I also became a father two months ago (twin boys) and can completely understand the lack of an instant consistent bond.\n\nThe past couple weeks I've had to make a real concerted effort to bond more and, honestly, it's massively paid off (even though I type this on little sleep as 'my' baby for the night kept me awake for hours).\n\nHonest advice- cultural norms or not, you're the father and you ARE just as important as the mother. I personally thinm you need to push back at the wife a little and make sure you're being heard/respected and able to form that bond.", "So your first mistake was agreeing to \"defer to your wife\" in regards to the baby. Two yes, one no. Not all her yes with you in the background. That is likely contributing to your issues with bonding. You are being treated as a workhorse and not as a parent. \n\nRoutines are great. Routines that work for the child, the mother and the father. The in-laws be damned. MIL can calm the baby because MIL is not being treated as a workhorse or as a nuisance. MIL is being treated like an equal parent in the process and being allowed to actually cuddle and bond with the baby. \n\nInsist that IF the in-laws stay then one of them needs to be the night nurse. That is what they are there for correct? When MIL tried to take the baby or your wife demands her mother be given the baby simply say \"Not right now\" and continue on with what you are doing. The baby won't melt because he fusses. He does not need to be nor should he be silent all of the time. Babies communicate through crying, fussing, cooing, etc. \n\nNTA for feeling the way you are being treated.", "NTA. This is a difficult situation but how can you bond when you are not allowed to even hold him? Not everyone gets instant feels over a new baby. Bonding in the first few months is very important. If I were you I would ignore their demands and hold your son when you want to and even leave the room if they want to start complaining. It's perfectly healthy for a child to cry some and not wanting him to cry is illogical.", "ESH - your wife is taking away your ability to learn how to care for your son. Of course he cries, he's a baby. That's what they do. She's being controlling. It's going to mess things up. \n\n\n\nBut you have to push through. You're a Dad now, and your son needs you. Step up.\n\n\n\nNext time you hold him and he cries, just walk around the room and gently bounce him. If she attempts to take him, say calmly and firmly, \"I am his father and I will take care of it.\" Then continue to work on soothing him. She may get pissed, but you deserve to learn and parent too", "You're in a weird marriage man. NTA.", "I think it's important for you and your wife to plan together how both of you are going to handle the baby after MIL leaves. MIL seems to have the best grasp on how to take care of a newborn, and seems to be doing a great job at it. I have no comments on their strict routine, but obviously you are having a problem with it as it is hindering you from occasionally disrupting the routine to hold the baby or play with it.\n\nINFO: Why do you oppose wife's idea to fit yourself into their baby schedule? Or are you just opposed to having a schedule at all?\n\nLastly you may be feeling detached and \"cold\" now towards the baby because of the situation, but this is a defensive coping mechanism that is counterproductive. I hope you can be a little self aware of this so you don't let it slip and spiral out of control.\n\nNAH", "YTA and I am sure \"the boy\" has an actual human name, dude. use it. treat him like the tiny person that he is...not some secret mystery.", "YTA and yes you are being petty. \n\nYour baby is depending on you to fight to protect him for the rest of your life, and you've given up two months in. \n\nYou've demonstrated skill in baby care for years? Because, just like every other skill, you have to learn it. Other skills don't just transfer to infant care. How much preparation in baby care have you done? Seems like if you'd watch a video to learn how fix the dryer or build a birdhouse, you'd watch one to learn how to take care of your son. Maybe more than one. Maybe read a couple of books. It's the most important job you'll ever have. Doesn't seem unreasonable to have some preparation. Maybe when your wife sees you're putting the effort in, she'll feel more trusting. \n\nThis seems like a better plan than throwing up your hands and saying, \"Guess my son and I won't have a good relationship. I gave an eight week try. What else can I do?\" \n\nIs your wife being overly protective and controlling? Yes. It's common with new parents because they're fucking terrified and every cell in their body is screaming when the baby cries. But work with your wife on this. You're not just bonding with the baby, but building a parenting bridge of trust between the two of you, too. Tell her you feel hurt and shut out and unable to bond. Ask her what time is a good time for you to hold the baby, talk to your MIL for tips, keep expressing your feelings and it will get better.

Or are you just opposed to having a schedule at all?\n\nInitially I felt insulted by the idea that I should have to make an appointment to hold my own son. I think as his father I should have the right to interrupt the routine if I deem it appropriate, and I should be trusted not to be reckless or unreasonable on those occasions that I do interrupt the routine. Secondly, I was sort of trying to capture the moments when I felt tender or affectionate, which I can't exactly schedule.

Third, I personally don't like being so restricted, but I can get over that if I must.\n\nYes I can integrate into the routine, but I don't have a motivation to do it at this point.

It's a very rare person that doesn't and you have the right attitude so I'm confident it will happen.

The timing is only variable in that the baby might poop or get hungry and slightly variable times, but he's somewhat consistent and they build in a window for feeding time so that block of time is scheduled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You need to get to the bottom of why your wife doesn't trust you - is it purely cultural (men don't know how to care for their children and that's a woman's job?). Could it be PPD or another medical issue? Is it MIL's doing?\n\nI don't think it's PPD, but I admit it could be and I'm just unaware. I frequently ask her how she's doing and she seems great. I do think culture is a factor (baby=woman's job), and her parents are a big factor (MIL wears the pants and thinks she more competent than FIL, who is passive and mildly indulgent towards her). I also think she's just super nervous all the time because it's our first child and she frankly doesn't know what she's doing (not that I know better).", "You don't know what you're talking about.\n\nI've done everything that's expected of a father, even a nice American family man, except breastfeed obviously.

Be open to it, don't force it, he will be your little prince one day.", "This. Being so restricted from contact with your kid could very easily cause ppd. Your body is releasing oxytocin and vasopressin to support bonding (albeit not as intensely as your wife's was at birth but still significantly more than usual) and you're not getting the contact needed to make that a positive experience. This would feel isolating, lonely, it would hurt on a physical level. You may be dissociating from that pain and it's causing you to be disconnected from your child. Look it up and see what the suggestions are, gather your info and talk to your wife about the impact it's having on you as well as the impact it will have on your kid if she keeps it up", "Ever heard of nicknames?", "How can he develop that connection if his wife will barely let him hold the kid?

That crap is childish.\n\n\n\n\nI'm offering legitimate advice and then pointing out potential abuse TOWARDS YOU & YOUR SON. you're welcome to ignore that charge, but I'd at least like you to consider the unhealthy element of it.", "Sage advice. I have much to think about, but I may take it. Thank you.", "I understand your intentions are good, and for what it's worth I appreciate the gesture. I don't think it's good, I just don't like that you're calling it abuse. That's ridiculous.", "NTA \n\n\n**You don't need permission to spend time with your son.** Stop asking or waiting for it, because if you do that, you give your wife and MIL all the decision power.

First of all, I would kick MIL out (not out of anger, but I would say she overstayed). Then I would firmly talk to my wife again...   \nI get your frustration... NTA, but your wife is... major!  \nLook I am a mom too... and I am single mom since my son was born. Every woman can take care of the baby, without extra help. I also created a routine and was strict about it... but you are part of the family, so I would expect you to be involved.\n\nKick your in-laws or just MIL out and then you will see the change.", "Why don't you just take your wife up on her offer to book in a time?

You bother because this is your child and you will regret it for your entire life if you don't.\n\nYou are right, she doesn't trust your skills or judgement .... So what? She's just given birth, hormones are all over the shop, and she probably doesn't even trust herself fully yet. Trusting her parents is easy, she knows they can do it because they did it for her. Trusting the man who won't even book in a time in the child's routine to learn to hold him is much tougher.", "Tell her to shut her mouth and stop talking to you like an idiot. He's your child and you want to hold him, if he cries he cries.", "Yta. You say you do the night shift with your child. Why aren't you able to build a bond then. \n\nAlso I just don't understand people who don't automatically feel a shift within themselves and know that they will do anything to keep their child safe and happy.

That\u2019s a mental breakdown waiting to happen. Babies fuss sometimes. Heck my nephew is two, he fusses sometimes still.

If not, your son might become unbearable if MIL isn\u2019t there to calm him down. That is your son. You need to have chances to bond and learn to help him and not by watching videos.

She might need therapy.", "NTA tell your wife and in laws to stfu", "Be patient. She's a new mom, he's only 2 months old.", "YTA and let me explain why.\n\nYour relationship with your son will NOT magically get all warm and fuzzy if you let your wife and MIL freeze you out of his life and just be a nighttime bottle feeder and cash ATM. \n\nYou say it's cultural, this is complete nonsense. You live in a modern society and your son WILL NOT grow into a functional adult if he witnesses mommy and MIL make all the decisions for his care and dad be a passing ship who write checks. \n\nYou are being put in a place where you are told you are too incompetent to even hold your own child without being reprimanded, told to give him back or condescendingly told to watch videos on the \"correct\" way to be with him. \n\nThe \"routine\" is, in effect, a way to completely ice you out and an extremely controlling move.

In any scenario, you are cowardly choosing the \"easy\" path of not saying \"no\" to your wife because you want peace. In laws who come to help are usually here to cook, help with the laundry, allow mom to rest and recover physically from birth and/r support you two if you have to work.

MIL sounds like a nightmare who has a tight hold on your wife.  Are they there permanently?  Or is this a temporary time for early stage support?\n\nI hate to say this, and plenty of people will disagree, but being forceful and \"standing your ground\" sounds like a recipe for disaster. I think the most important thing is proving to your wife that you are not the incompetent man she wrongly believes you are. And that means 1- scheduling your own 1hr time of cuddles (I know that's not what you want, but it's better than getting into a fight or emotionally checking out) and 2- having a conversation with your wife without MIL around to remind her that you do the nights and therefore have a basic level of ability with your kid.\n\nI am sorry, this sounds like a really tricky situation to navigate, especially if you are butting into a headstrong MIL and sticky cultural norms.

Obviously it's different but it can manifest in all the symptoms you are showing - a disconnect with the child, apathy, a loss of a desire to be involved.

Explain that the only way it will work is if she gives you room to make mistakes. Tell her that she's right that MIL is a calming presence, and your child crying seems to upset her immensely. So, it makes sense that just you and MIL be in the room. If mommy balks. Tell her that it also means mommy doesn't have to endure the upset she clearly experiences when daddy picks up baby.
