My in laws moved in from another country to help care for the boy for a few months. My wife and her family have rigid adherence to routine, and spontaneity brings them stress. After the first week I volunteer to take the night shift, so I'm sleeping during the day and feeding/changing at night. We agreed that I would defer to my wife about decisions about the baby.\n\nI didn't have an instant bond with our son. I gather this is common for a new father, and that a bond will come in time. On occasion I feel a spike of affection and ask to hold the boy. Each time the boy fussed during the handoff and right away my wife has told me to give him back to MIL (who is the best at calming him). I told her it really bothers me that she doesn't give me a chance, and while she doesn't fully understand the nuance of my feelings, she gets the gist.\n\nA few nights ago, I once again asked to hold my son. My MIL hands him over without objection, and when the boy fusses during the hand off my wife jumps in and tells me to give him back right away. I'm very frustrated because I thought she wouldn't do this again, plus it's making it much harder for me to build a bond with the boy. Then, I go to tell my wife in another room that I think it's not cool that she keeps doing this, and she tells me that she doesn't want the boy to cry and I'm disrupting the routine. I tell her I should be able to hold him even if he cries because I'm his father, plus I need practice anyway. She responds with saying I should schedule a time to hold him so that it fits into their routine, and she offered to take some videos of MIL calming the boy so I could learn from her technique. I know she genuinely doesn't mean any harm, is influenced by her emotions, and is trying to do what's best for the boy despite being stressed. But **I felt so insulted and furious at this**. My take is that she doesn't trust my skill or judgment even though I've demonstrated good judgment and high competence for years.\n\nI told her I thought it was bullshit but didn't yell, then went to do my night shift. I don't have strong feelings for the boy. I know it sounds cold, and I'm sorry, but I need to be honest. And I am unwilling to fight the boy's mother for access to him. She takes excellent care of him, and they treat me like a nuisance. I'm frankly not needed. This probably sounds like I'm being petty, but my original intentions were to spend extra effort to push myself to develop warm and fuzzy feelings towards our baby, but now I don't want to do that. If they develop it can be slowly and naturally over time. Wife and in laws can overwhelm the baby with hugs and kisses and I will just stay out of the way. I still will fulfill my responsibilities 100%.\n\nSo AITA for stopping my \"extra effort\" at bonding?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA:\n\n(1) Me \"deferring\" to my wife when it comes to decisions about babies is a cultural thing.\n\n(2) I'd gladly fight against the world for him, but not against his own mother (assuming she's not abusive, of course).\n\n(2.1) It's absolutely NOT spite. I don't want to fight against his mother. I was pushing myself to be with my son, because I don't currently feel a craving to be with him, and thought it was what I was supposed to do, figuring I'd develop that craving over time. I don't want to push myself further because I'd have to fight against the boy's mother to do so. She is a good mother, he gets excellent care. I will not abandon them, I am certain I will eventually grow to have feelings for him over the months and years ahead. I simply don't want to fight his mother to accelerate it.\n\n(3) Please chill about \"the boy\". It's a playful thing that I developed with my wife before he was born that comes from the Simpsons, and she's fine with it. It's harmless, I'm not a psycho, I just didn't know realize it would freak people out.

Your wife is a huge AH. Don't let her dictate how you can interact with your own son.", "YWBTA if you transfer your annoyance at your wife, to your newborn son. None of this is his fault, so to throw your hands in the air and refuse to bond with him would make you a major AH. \n\nAlso, you don\u2019t need to \u2018defer\u2019 to your wife regarding your son. You went 50/50 in creating him, so you can go 50/50 on decisions pertaining to him.", "NTA. That is your son and it sounds like your wife and MIL are controlling everything with zero regard to your input. Routines can be helpful but this isn't just routine--these are controlling people. Personally, I think it's really weird to not let a father hold his baby because the baby might cry. Babies are going to cry anyway! This is not a healthy situation. I don't blame you for not feeling a bond since you're being excluded from the child-raising process and basically are being told you're not allowed or trusted to take care of him or even hold him.\n\nYou'll want to do something about this as soon as you can, in any way you can. You need to appeal to the mother of your child. If you give up now, you've basically given up for good and the kid is the one who is really going to suffer for it. I don't care what culture people are from, you can't just ban the other parent of your child from having access to them (unless of course they're abusive or irresponsible).\n\nPut your foot down and communicate with your wife. You're not a glorified sperm donor so you shouldn't be treated like one. Remind her that you are the father and get half a say in caring for and holding the child. If she refuses to listen, then you'll have to explore whatever options you're left with.", "NTA. I also became a father two months ago (twin boys) and can completely understand the lack of an instant consistent bond.\n\nThe past couple weeks I've had to make a real concerted effort to bond more and, honestly, it's massively paid off (even though I type this on little sleep as 'my' baby for the night kept me awake for hours).\n\nHonest advice- cultural norms or not, you're the father and you ARE just as important as the mother. I personally thinm you need to push back at the wife a little and make sure you're being heard/respected and able to form that bond.", "So your first mistake was agreeing to \"defer to your wife\" in regards to the baby. Two yes, one no. Not all her yes with you in the background. That is likely contributing to your issues with bonding. You are being treated as a workhorse and not as a parent. \n\nRoutines are great. Routines that work for the child, the mother and the father. The in-laws be damned. MIL can calm the baby because MIL is not being treated as a workhorse or as a nuisance. MIL is being treated like an equal parent in the process and being allowed to actually cuddle and bond with the baby. \n\nInsist that IF the in-laws stay then one of them needs to be the night nurse. That is what they are there for correct? When MIL tried to take the baby or your wife demands her mother be given the baby simply say \"Not right now\" and continue on with what you are doing. The baby won't melt because he fusses. He does not need to be nor should he be silent all of the time. Babies communicate through crying, fussing, cooing, etc. \n\nNTA for feeling the way you are being treated.", "NTA. This is a difficult situation but how can you bond when you are not allowed to even hold him? Not everyone gets instant feels over a new baby. Bonding in the first few months is very important. If I were you I would ignore their demands and hold your son when you want to and even leave the room if they want to start complaining. It's perfectly healthy for a child to cry some and not wanting him to cry is illogical.", "ESH - your wife is taking away your ability to learn how to care for your son. Of course he cries, he's a baby. That's what they do. She's being controlling. It's going to mess things up. \n\n\n\nBut you have to push through. You're a Dad now, and your son needs you. Step up.\n\n\n\nNext time you hold him and he cries, just walk around the room and gently bounce him. If she attempts to take him, say calmly and firmly, \"I am his father and I will take care of it.\" Then continue to work on soothing him. She may get pissed, but you deserve to learn and parent too", "You're in a weird marriage man. NTA.", "I think it's important for you and your wife to plan together how both of you are going to handle the baby after MIL leaves. MIL seems to have the best grasp on how to take care of a newborn, and seems to be doing a great job at it. I have no comments on their strict routine, but obviously you are having a problem with it as it is hindering you from occasionally disrupting the routine to hold the baby or play with it.\n\nINFO: Why do you oppose wife's idea to fit yourself into their baby schedule? Or are you just opposed to having a schedule at all?\n\nLastly you may be feeling detached and \"cold\" now towards the baby because of the situation, but this is a defensive coping mechanism that is counterproductive. I hope you can be a little self aware of this so you don't let it slip and spiral out of control.\n\nNAH", "YTA and I am sure \"the boy\" has an actual human name, dude. use it. treat him like the tiny person that he is...not some secret mystery.", "YTA and yes you are being petty. \n\nYour baby is depending on you to fight to protect him for the rest of your life, and you've given up two months in. \n\nYou've demonstrated skill in baby care for years? Because, just like every other skill, you have to learn it. Other skills don't just transfer to infant care. How much preparation in baby care have you done? Seems like if you'd watch a video to learn how fix the dryer or build a birdhouse, you'd watch one to learn how to take care of your son. Maybe more than one. Maybe read a couple of books. It's the most important job you'll ever have. Doesn't seem unreasonable to have some preparation. Maybe when your wife sees you're putting the effort in, she'll feel more trusting. \n\nThis seems like a better plan than throwing up your hands and saying, \"Guess my son and I won't have a good relationship. I gave an eight week try. What else can I do?\" \n\nIs your wife being overly protective and controlling? Yes. It's common with new parents because they're fucking terrified and every cell in their body is screaming when the baby cries. But work with your wife on this. You're not just bonding with the baby, but building a parenting bridge of trust between the two of you, too. Tell her you feel hurt and shut out and unable to bond. Ask her what time is a good time for you to hold the baby, talk to your MIL for tips, keep expressing your feelings and it will get better. I swear. \n\nAnd congratulations on your new baby.\n\n.", "YTA because based on what you say in your culture it is common for the wife to do most of the child rearing.  So why right this post \n\nSo your wife is doing all the child rearing so why are you asking us if you are the ass hole when in your culture what you are doing is ok and you seem to be ok with it.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t carry him inside you, culturally it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re inclined or \u201callowed\u201d to have much in the way of time or effort spent caring for him. \n\nFor me, I\u2019m a mom. I\u2019ve had two sons and currently growing a third. For my second; I didn\u2019t feel ANYTHING for the first few months of his life.

His wife has no right to tell him he's not allowed to hold him.", ">INFO: Why do you oppose wife's idea to fit yourself into their baby schedule? Or are you just opposed to having a schedule at all?\n\nInitially I felt insulted by the idea that I should have to make an appointment to hold my own son. I think as his father I should have the right to interrupt the routine if I deem it appropriate, and I should be trusted not to be reckless or unreasonable on those occasions that I do interrupt the routine. Secondly, I was sort of trying to capture the moments when I felt tender or affectionate, which I can't exactly schedule. Those are the reasons I didn't join in the routine beforehand with this bonding approach, and why I had a bad reaction to what my wife said. Third, I personally don't like being so restricted, but I can get over that if I must.\n\nYes I can integrate into the routine, but I don't have a motivation to do it at this point. I don't have a personal craving to be with him, I'm kinda pushing myself out of my comfort zone because I sorta thought that's what I was supposed to do, and assumed I'd eventually develop that craving to spend time with him. I'm still on the fence about it because I want to do the right thing, but I frankly don't know what that is. Everyone here (I assume mostly nice American folks) take for granted that the right thing is to destroy everything around me until I establish 50/50 time with him.

It's a very rare person that doesn't and you have the right attitude so I'm confident it will happen. But part of how you develop those feelings is by giving care and your wife is actively sabotaging your efforts to do that. Your son, who you refer to as \"the boy\" (oof btw), needs skin to skin contact and nurturing at this age. He needs to smell you and associate that smell with safety and protection. He needs to feel your heartbeat, hear your voice, feel the way your arms hold him. \n\nYour wife is being unreasonable and it's not only hurting you, it's hurting your son. If you're really unwilling to take on this battle fully, do what's she's asked and study how to soothe him then schedule time to practice. Show her you're serious and committed to being a present and engaged father. Earn the trust she should be giving you automatically. Deal with the underlying issues when there isn't a newborn in need of love and constant care, cause this is not OK behaviour from your wife but now might not be the time to address it fully. \n\nNTA just yet, but don't just concede. These months, particularly from when he's about 3 months old and starts to recognise different caregivers and have associations for how safe he feels with each one, are critical not only to your long term relationship but also to his brain development. Don't opt out because it's difficult, do what you need to do to be there for your kid then address why she treated you so badly when the pressure has eased."]}
