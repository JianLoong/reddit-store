She needs to find a babysitter in her neighborhood to watch her children. It's too much of a hassle for you and it's not your responsibility. I think offering to have them come to your house and stay during a Christmas Vacation while your sister is at work is more than enough to expect you to do. Don't let your sister bully you because of her lack of preparation for care for her own kids. You are not wrong on this.", "NTA. You're not in a no-win situation. You can just say no, and then you'll win. It's not very complicated, actually. \n\nI'm guessing the problem is that if you don't obey your sister's orders, she throws a huge tantrum, calls you a terrible person, and then cuts you out of her life for months, to REALLY make you feel like you must have done something wrong (because otherwise how could she even make herself cut you off for months at a time). The reality is that saying \"no\" to babysitting her kids, is completely acceptable, even if it were just so you can sit at your house and eat bon-bons. Saying \"no\" to babysitting her kids when, as now, it's a huge imposition on you, is more than acceptable. \n\nIf you want to figure out how you've been trained to capitulate to her when she cuts you off, or why you feel guilty for declining to do someone in your family a massively burdensome favor,  you'd probably have to go to therapy for that.", "GUYSSSS she said \u201cI understand, thank you\u201d you have no idea how much you guys have helped me!!! I sent a few of the comments to her and told her how I feel entirely and was completely transparent with her. It\u2019s truly not like her to not come for me in these type of situations. I\u2019m not sure if she is silently mad or if she is actually growing up and seeing things from the perspectives of others. But anyways you guys are amazing. Who knew I could turn to Reddit for help with my sister lol", "NTA. You are doing her the favor, so she needs to accommodate you", "NTA, she's trying to pick up and move 5 people just to accommodate 3 people. Way more practical if she's willing to drive anyway just to drop her 2 off. Does she always deliberately make things way harder than they need to be, or is she just completely oblivious? At some point the common sense of dropping off 2 children instead of picking up an adult with 4 children has to kick in, right? The clues are all there, she's just not picking them up.", "NTA\n\nIt's a totally reasonable compromise for her to bring them to you.\n\nThe current issue aside, she's a total AH for weaponising her kids. \n\nExpecting you to watch them sometimes & cutting you/their Uncle & cousins  out of their lives at others...that's going to be hurtful to both families. I hope she does read that.\n\nWhere's her kids' father or his family in all this?", "NTA\n\nThey're her kids, not yours, it's not your responsibility. If she realllllllllllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedddddddddddddssssss someone soooooooooooooooooooooooooo baddddddddddddddddddddddllyyyyyyyyyyyyy to watch them at her house. she gets someone who'll watch them at her house. End of story.\n\nIf it were one of my brothers, the only way I'd watch them is by having them bring the kids over to my house.
