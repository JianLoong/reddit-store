She needs to find a babysitter in her neighborhood to watch her children. It's too much of a hassle for you and it's not your responsibility.

You can just say no, and then you'll win.

The reality is that saying \"no\" to babysitting her kids, is completely acceptable, even if it were just so you can sit at your house and eat bon-bons. Saying \"no\" to babysitting her kids when, as now, it's a huge imposition on you, is more than acceptable. \n\nIf you want to figure out how you've been trained to capitulate to her when she cuts you off, or why you feel guilty for declining to do someone in your family a massively burdensome favor,  you'd probably have to go to therapy for that.", "GUYSSSS she said \u201cI understand, thank you\u201d you have no idea how much you guys have helped me!!!

Then one day I just snapped and got so sick of it I ended up cutting her out. We didn't speak at all for about 4 years and honestly, life was much better after that. Nowadays we speak sporadically and are no longer close. We do not ask each other for favors or anything of that nature but we do have a relationship of sorts that is much better than what we had for the majority of our lives where we stayed in regular contact. \n\nMoral of the story is stop living in fear of someone and accommodating them because they're an asshole. It's harder because there are kids involved, but with a parent like that I'm sure her kids will grow up to be very...nice.", "You need to start making a stand for yourself and your family. If she cuts you and your family out that is up to her but the back-and-forth is going to hurt your kids more than sticking to your principles and standing up for them and you.", "She will be the one with shame on her on her hands if she blocks you for having healthy boundaries. Her loss the most. As who really needs that toxic attitude around them?", "Now is the time to grow up. Because now her behavior isn\u2019t hurting you it\u2019s hurting her kids. Which she will continue to do until you stand up to her.", "If she or anyone else tries to give you crap, remind them.\n\n\"*I agreed to help, it just had to be at my house.  As you know, my husband works, we have 1 car, and I have FOUR children under the age of XX.  I was willing to watch 2 additional kids for free, but it needed to be at my house.*\"\n\nAnd let me just say, you are a SAINT for agreeing to even entertain her request!", "You've always known something wasn't right about the relationship you and your sister have but since it was your 'normal' you've just always rolled with it the way it is.\n\nAs we get older, we do find ourselves creating and resetting some of our boundaries. We re-evaluate how we feel about the treatment that we give and we receive. This is normal. This is right.\n\nNow that you are developing your shiny spine to stand up for yourself, it is possible to have a better relationship with your sister but only if she can accept the following:\n\n1. Love is reciprocal. It is active. Always. Every relationship we have must be a mutual exchange of respect.\n2. You're not children anymore. The time of throwing temper tantrums to get her own way is long over. It's fine to feel a way if a person disagrees with you or be disappointed they can't do something for you. It's not okay to seek to punish the differences that you and your loved ones will have.\n3. Manipulation tactics do not create a healthy, loving, or stable atmosphere for any relationship.\n4. She needs to realize all this 'cutting off' may very well one day become permanent. People don't have to deal with us..at all...in any capacity.\n5. People do get tired of there being constant drama with a person. Just because someone is related to you doesn't automatically make them your family. My personal gauge has been the question, \"If I weren't related to this person, would I even want to be their friend?\" If the answer is no? I am very able and very good at wishing them well and loving them from afar.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Sadly I think you\u2019re right", "That\u2019s gotta be up there with my top 3 biggest fears. Because her kids are such kind beautiful souls I am so afraid they will change because of her. Last time I kept her son (6 years old) he just wanted to lay down. He said \u201cAunt April I\u2019m just so tired\u201d :\u2019( so that was concerning.", "This is where you set boundaries. She has to respect that you WANT the relationship but you don\u2019t NEED it. She may cut you off or she may start to respect you more. If you get respect your getting what you deserve. if she cuts you off that less toxicity in your life.", "Yesss", "This Reddit has honestly opened my eyes SO MUCH. I\u2019m standing my ground from here on out. I feel empowered lol", "Yes. Someone said I need therapy to deal with the verbal manipulation she\u2019s put me through (and I\u2019ve allowed it smh) all these years and they\u2019re probably not wrong", "Thisssss. You might have just solved a world of future problems with my sister and me. Thank you so much. Like actually thank you. I think I just breathed for the first time in 10 years", "Haha thank you :)", "She\u2019s horrendously toxic and highly manipulative. This is usually deliberate behavior because the person has found they can get what they want by acting that way. Please don\u2019t let her continue to do this. Just draw clear boundaries but in a calm and matter-of-fact way. Leave things open for a relationship if she\u2019s willing to be reasonable. This sounds exhausting. And she\u2019s got you all tied into knots. Yes, your kids would miss their cousins if she pulls back again. But I promise you WILL feel better if you firmly draw that line.", "The problem is she will use this to keep you accommodating her.  You WANT the relationship but you do not NEED it.  Her using her kids against you is a pretty shitty thing. She doesn\u2019t show you love when she does that.  I have seen/read  too many parents try to use the \u201ckid card\u201d and do it with a straight face to justify their feelings of entitlement and excuse/ignore a lot of things that they should be ashamed of.", "It's worth doing that work to break old patterns\u2014I'm speaking from experience. But what I've found is that the first few times of not being a doormat can be highly dramatic because the bulldozer is used to holding all the power. Experience, however, has also taught me that it won't get easier until I stop being a doormat and stay firm on my choices. My process involves figuring out a basic \"this is what I can do\" brief statement and not allowing the other person to drag me into a discussion. Another benefit from claiming your power is showing your children how strong women take care of themselves.", "Hugs. It\u2019s shocking and sad to realize the people we love are abusing us. Stay strong!", "It's not your fault\n\nYou're reacting to/been conditioned to years of abuse from someone who weaponises her kids & deprives them of your love.\n\nI hope you find a way to break free. Hugs to youx", "You\u2019re very welcome. There\u2019s a great book for you, Stop Walking on Eggshells. It\u2019ll give you some great insight and practical ideas on how to handle situations.", "We may have broken some ground here. It\u2019s hard to read through a text, but I finally got the nerve to tell her it\u2019s my way or no way (this time) and she replied \u201cI understand, thank you\u201d I don\u2019t know whether to be relieved or scared lol but I\u2019m not sweating it", "This is definitely the path I\u2019ve chosen. By posting this I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019ve been enabling her behavior all these years & me and my mom (and possibly her husband) are the only ones who can correct it by standing our ground. It only will get deeper and deeper with her kids learning these behavior or trying to constantly please her which is so horrible to think about", "I freaking love this. All of it", "Yes it\u2019s the realization, you\u2019re right it\u2019s as shocking as getting a bucket of ice water poured over your head. Like how did I get here :(", "One step at a time, tysm!", "I will definitely check it out! Thanks!", "Good, you deserve a standing ovation and a nap. Keep that momentum going and keep looking at things logically.", "Maybe she asked friends for feedback and discovered that you are right", "100% I feel like I just breathed a breath I\u2019ve been holding in for 10+ years", "The trouble with a nap (according to my BFF with 4 chaos gremlins) is what the cute little gremlins get up to while mom sleeps LOL.", "You can't see me, but I am beaming over the fact that you took this step.  Your kids will miss their cousins if she has a tantrum and avoids you for the immediate future, but she loses out on christmas break day care ;) so I'd be surprised if that happens.", "NTA - she asked for a favor. You agreed to the favor with a condition, they come to your home. She can choose to accept or not but she doesn\u2019t to get to push you for more than you are willing to do.", "NTA- If you are doing the favors then you should set the boundaries.\n\nYou can tell her with your husband working that she needs to bring the children over to your house. Otherwise you will be unable to.\n\nAnd you understand that if she cuts you off over the holidays, that's her choice.", "Learning as I go :)", "Yes lol", "This is true", "It\u2019s been a recurring theme. Something I need to work on to improve my mental health, saying no & deleting nonsense drama from my life & my family", "They normally go to after school for a bit before she gets off work", "Yesss", "I agree with this soooo much", "Yesss", "She is the boss or so she thinks. She had it planned and that\u2019s just *the way it was gonna be*. Little did she know I would stand up for myself this time", "Hahaha swear", "100%", "Thank you :)", "Yesss", "As long as she knows she can purchase her way by just cutting you out, she'll continue to act like this.\n\nI get that it hurts your kids in the short term, but if she just stops entirely or actually grows up, you win.", "I get it. I recently put up some hard boundaries with family I never thought would cut me off. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m happier this way. \n\nWe like to think of people we love as the people we image them to be. When they turn out to be assholes you\u2019re loosing two people: them as they are, and then as you imagined/hoped they would be.\n\nIt\u2019s sucky and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "You're a superhero, I can just tell!\n\nAs a mom of a 4yo, 2yo, and 4mo- I salute you \ud83d\udc9c \n\nYou're a great mom and 100% NTA- I'm sorry your sister feels entitled to inconvenience you, but your \"no\" is valid and heard. \n\nIs your sister's name Audacity, by any chance?", "Just mainly her kids I\u2019m worried about at this point. I have blocked her out though, this time", "There is sooooo much truth here!", "Hahaha thank you so much! It always means so much when someone says that! \n& yesss Audacity seems fitting \ud83e\udd23", "Yes and I\u2019m hoping some separation will help in the long run", "You're welcome! \ud83d\udc9c Do not feel even an ounce of guilt about saying \"no\" to traveling- you offered a more than fair solution: she come to you. \n\nI'm sure the holidays are stressing her out, too, but you're still willing to be there for her in a very generous and reasonable way. \n\nI don't think I could handle taking on more kids that weren't my own at all with the ages and quantity you have just from your own children. Like I said- super hero!\n\nHopefully, she comes around one way or another, but you definitely shouldn't stress about it!", "I know this is hard. Believe me. I know. It is SO hard. But I also know\u2026it is so incredibly freeing. I hope you can find peace here. I\u2019ve been there. That kind of anxiety is awful. You\u2019re making the right steps. We (as humans) don\u2019t have to put up with toxic behavior just because of the \u201cbut they\u2019re family\u201d attitude that is ingrained in our society. That needs to change. Doesn\u2019t have to be a nasty, mean, angry, turn-your-back kind of thing. Just a calm, reasonable boundary. Good luck!", "Haha I understand!!"]}
