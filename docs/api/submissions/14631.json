Me and my boyfriend have been living together for a year, and been a couple for a total of 3 years. I have met my boyfriends childhood friend  that I am now posting about several times and he has always been very kind to me. However, meeting his fianc\u00e9e, was a different story. She was very rude to me, talked only to my boyfriend and when I tried to be apart of their conversation she told me that my boyfriend used to be in love with her friend, which I had no idea about since it happened 10 years ago before I was apart of his life. I continued to try to be kind to her and complemented her engagement ring, asking when they we\u2019re supposed to get married. Her reply to me was \u201cwhen is your boyfriend going to propose to you?\u201d \n\nI was surprised and said; I don\u2019t know and remained silent for a while, letting them keep their conversation going before asking my boyfriend to come with me to the bar to get a drink. At the bar I explained I didn\u2019t feel very welcome and asked if we could leave. He wanted to stay and we did. I continued to try to be kind to everyone since I didn\u2019t know most of the people there. \n \nI have since then, met both my boyfriends friend and his fianc\u00e9 and it has been fine. \n\nHowever, We recently received a wedding invitation that states that they are getting married this summer. My boyfriend has payed for a bachelor party that includes them going for a weekend in another country. \n \nUnfortunately, My name was not on the wedding invitation, however it was signed \u201cwe look forward to celebrate our special day with you\u201d. Since me and my boyfriend have been a couple for three years and are living together, we both assumed I\u2019d be included in the invite, but to make sure my boyfriend asked the groom if it was okay to rvsp for both of us. \nHis friend responded that they couldn\u2019t have every one bring a plus one. As my boyfriend thought it was a decision for all of their mutual friends who wasn\u2019t married he said he understood. However, it now seems that I\u2019m the only one of the girlfriends/wife\u2019s who are not invited.\nI would really hate for him to miss this event, but clearly the fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t like me and I feel like if my boyfriend went without me it would be making  it okay for her to exclude me for no real reason.  \n\nI think he should ask his friend why I\u2019m the only one not invited and ask how he\u2019s friend would\u2019ve reacted if it was the other way around and it was them in our situation. They\u2019ve known each other for nearly 20 years, it just seems wrong to not invite his partner as well and it\u2019s breaking my heart seeing my boyfriend going through having to choose, yet at the same time I feel as all our mutual friends are going he should stand up for me\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681324871, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jurhe/aita_for_asking_boyfriend_of_three_years_to_not/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His friend/friend's fiance are being absolutely awful to you for no good reason, and your boyfriend needs to recognize that if he chooses to accept this and go to this wedding without you that he's telling you people can treat you awful if they want and he *will not* stand up for you. You have every reason not to be ok with that.", "NTA\n\nWhy isn't your boyfriend standing up for you? I don't think allowing friends to treat a partner like this is right at all.

If he goes to the wedding alone, I wouldn't be surprised if there were all kinds of \"odd coincidences\". Like them being seated next to each other throughout the events, assigned adjacent hotel rooms, maybe she's even at the bachelor party (always a good idea to add alcohol if you're trying to play matchmaker).   \nThey clearly don't see you as his long-term partner, and if he goes along with it, maybe you should have a conversation with him if that's how he feels too.", "NTA\n\nIf there is no legitimate reason why the fianc\u00e9 doesn't like you since your first meeting, then I find it rude that your BF wasn't given the option to have a plus 1.

Your BF should be standing up for you.\n\n~~However, YTA if you force your BF to not go and give him an ultimatum about this. I think asking his friend is a good start and reasonable.~~\n\nEDIT: I took out the last part because the BF is enabling his friend and the fianc\u00e9's behavior towards the OP by not standing up for her.

It\u2019s bad timing since it\u2019s so close to the wedding, but he had enough time over the years to stand up for you when she treated you like that. Honestly, if you do end up marrying this guy, I\u2019m sure he will convince you to invite her to your wedding so as not to rock the boat.\n\nSo, in this instance I don\u2019t really support the whole \u2018she\u2019s the bride she can invite whoever she wants, you can do the same when you get married!\u2019 Because it\u2019ll never be in your favour and they\u2019ll show you repeatedly that it\u2019s an unequal relationship.", "Gentle ESH to you, big ESH to your boyfriend. \n\nI don\u2019t think you get to ask him not to go. He\u2019s known his friend since long, long before you came along. It\u2019s not his fault his friend is marrying a problem person. He can\u2019t do anything about that, and I think you asking him not to go is punishing him for his friend\u2019s choice of partner. \n\nBig ESH to him though for not standing up for you more. Bare minimum, HE should be the one initiating this conversation with his friend. HE should be making it clear to his friend that this is not an acceptable way to treat his partner. \n\nIf I were in this position, I wouldn\u2019t try to ask him not to go, as that\u2019s not my place, but I would be having serious discussions about his backbone and whether he\u2019s capable of making me a priority publicly.", "NAH, I think. your boyfriend can't invite someone to a wedding that isn't his but he also might not be able to not go. if he doesn't choose to stick up for you in this situation (and you can't make him do that either, really) then it might be an indication that he is the AH, ultimately.", "NTA for being slighted and feeling upset however \n\nYTA if you tell your boyfriend not to go.\n\n\nThis is their wedding and as rubbish as they are being about it, they can choose who to invite.\n\nBe the bigger person and tell your boyfriend to go if he wants. Don't stand in his way if he wants to go.\n\nAt this point, you wouldn't enjoy going probably anyways I would guess, as there is some tension built because of this.", "YTA\n\nIt's his childhood friend. Who knows why the bride to be didn't invite you but assuming that she doesn't like you when the reality could be she doesn't want to pay for an extra person she doesn't know that well. Your shouldn't force your boyfriend to choose between his childhood friend and you because in the end, you will lose (even if he doesn't go, you will forever be blamed and it will make a bad situation worse). Let him go and you go have a spa day", "ESH.\n\nI think it's super shitty of them to not invite you.\n\nBut this is his best friend, a relationship that's existed longer than either you and your BFs or the best friend and his fiancees.\n\nSo I kinda think you putting your foot down like this will only result in him resenting you.", "ESH. I was in this exact same scenario a few years back. I had been with my boyfriend for 6 years at that point. The couple seemingly gave out arbitrary plus ones, even excluding spouses in some cases. That's an AH move on the part of the couple. It's tacky to give some friends in long term relationships plus ones and not others. It never feels good to be excluded.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, it's their wedding and their rules. They had known my boyfriend for 20+ years, and I had only met them a handful of times. I tried not to take it personally as I imagine if it was my own wedding and I had to cut down the guest list, I'd want someone I'm closer to there over a friend's SO who I barely know.  I didn't want to rob him of an important day with some of his oldest friends, regardless of how I felt. YTA if you don't let him go. If you continue to hang out with them after the wedding and the behavior continues, that's when your bf should step in. \n\nAlso just remember that when it's *your* wedding it will be *your* rules. If you're not making their guest list, they don't have to make yours either. :)", "ESH\n\nFriends are definitely assholes for not giving your BF a plus one seemingly to spite you. \n\nBut this is your BFs best friend. Asking him not to go is also asking him to severely damage that friendship, possibly permanently, which I don't think is fair either.", "Perhaps unpopular, but I\u2019m gonna go with a very gentle YTA.\n\nThis woman sounds like a jerk, and her fianc\u00e9e needs to grow a spine and not let her pull shit like this.\n\nBut your boyfriend isn\u2019t friends with her, he\u2019s friends with the groom. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask him to miss his friend of 20 years wedding, even thought his fianc\u00e9e sucks.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s hoping something will happen between him and the woman he was apparently into before, and that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t want you there. If you trust your partner, then this is all just a bunch of catty mean girl shit that you should both ignore.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think the fianc\u00e9e is the real AH here. I just think your boyfriend should still be able to support his friend despite that", "YTA. It's their wedding. If she doesn't like you, then she has no responsibility or moral imperative to invite you. You don't get to set boundaries for your boyfriend like this.", "YTA. He's known the groom for decades and you've met them a handful of times. You don't get to demand an invite to the most special (in theory) day of their life. It'd be nice if they could afford it or the venue had space but they'd have to not invite someone they actually know/like/care about in order to have you there.", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s a reason they do not like you, hence you not being invited. You controlling where your boyfriend can and cannot go is wrong. He\u2019s involved in the wedding. Find something to do with your time instead of thinking everyone must like you and therefore should invite you to things", "You're not invited. Having BF ask to confirm and why is reasonable.  But YTA of you tell him he can't go.", "YTA if you ask him not to go. \n\nALL the time on this sub I see people tell brides it's their wedding, they can invite who they want. \n\nSo in that respect, they've done nothing wrong in not including you. \n\nNow, does that mean you shouldn't be hurt?
