So you could have ask him or his teacher.\n2) you could have bought him something and the ask refund to his parents or school.\n3) my kids school always pack extra snacks on field trip cause someone always go missing food/dropping their lunch box etc etc. Shit happens specially with young kids.\nReally choose wrong profession.", "YTA.\n\nWhat was the plan? Just let him go hungry for the rest of the day? Buy the hot dog and save the receipt for the parents.\n\nIs this your first field trip? Pack snacks!

Going with YTA for shitposting.", "YTA. As the chaperone you should have prepared for this. When I was in elementary school there were always \u201ccold lunches\u201d the chaperones were in charge of bringing from the school\u2019s cafeteria for this exact scenario. No, teachers aren\u2019t rich, but you also could have kept the receipt and gotten reimbursed from the school. Or, you know- actually been the teacher children deserve and had some empathy for the child.

You're definitely the AH here, by such a huge margin that it legitimately makes me sad for the state of whatever educational system you work for. It's not even a real question. Some absolute mouth breathers in these comments have pointed out that it's a learning moment for the kid to be more responsible, but even IF that were true (it's not, the kids a fkng 7-year-old) it misses the point.\n\nYOU AND YOUR COWORKER are the responsible parties for the trip. That means it is LITTERALLY part of your job to solve, to the best of your abilities, any issue that arises on the trip. This isn't even a fkng hard one. A 7-year-old is old enough to know if they \\*cant\\* have something because of health reasons.

You really said no to a kid that was watching everyone eat around him while he had nothing? That is fucked up.

The welfare of your students is your responsibility.   Elementary aged children are sometimes irresponsible and forget things, so did you think to ask who had brought their lunch or who was going to purchase food at the zoo prior to the trip?   That would have told you someone had an issue.  I'm not saying you had to give him one of your sandwiches, but you needed to be aware there was a problem long before lunch rolled around.
