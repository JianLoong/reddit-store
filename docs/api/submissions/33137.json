She will do the same crap, only in front of your children...", "For your first anniversary, you should pick somewhere pretty, take the people who mean the most to you and renew your vows.

She is not done trying to sabotage your marriage.", "NTA and I'd suggest you and your husband go NC with her until you get an apology.", "NTA\n\nBut it's wild she felt comfortable enough to make such a comment. Shame on your husband for letting it get that far.", "Nta but your husband is a coward for not shutting her down for good.", "NTA, although it would have been preferable for it to be your husband.  She's disgusting.\n\nJust curious - why was she even with you during prep?  I thought Mom of the Groom is usually with him and his father and attendants that late morning and early afternoon except for maybe a run out to get her hair done.  The groom's \"courtesy ask\" if there is one needs to be with the bride and her attendants, but not his Mom (and vice versa, of course).  At least that's from my experience, which is only that of a Western Christian wedding.  Due to the \"couple shouldn't see eachother on the wedding day until the ceremony begins\" tradition/superstition, bride and groom usually aren't getting ready together.", "NTA. As the other commenters have said, she was unkind and intentionally rude. That is obviously not going to change. Going NC is the shortest path to peace in for you and your husband.\n\nMy MIL was the kindest and most generous person to me *at first*. When she realized I wasn't leaving, she changed into an evil, unkind, person who attempted to control my husband and I.  For me, the MIL was older *and she died*. My husband have been happily married for 25 years.\n\nI regret that we only had peace *after she died.* Did she really want to be remembered as a miserable person? Well, that is how I remember her and husband also remebers what she did to me/us. Sad isn't it?\n\nFunny, after she died her daughter tried to \"take over as the matricarch.\"  Hhahahaha I just ignored her and am now NC and we moved 2000 miles away. Peace at last!

If anyone would have said that about my wife or me, they would not have been invited. In fact they would have been told, explicitly, to not come (I woulda sent a \u201cstay the eff home\u201d card and all). I would not have cared if it was my family or not.

Why has your husband even entertained her for so long? You say he has talked with her, but what about simply refusing to allow her in your lives and not have her anywhere near you to be able to make such horrible comments. \n\nHe should have laid out ground rules that she either zips it and shuts up the whole wedding, or she isn't allowed there at all.", "NTA but your husband should have been the one to do it.

You did well to hold your tongue and not kick her out for the first comment. At least the comment during your vows reflected to everyone what a piece of work she is. You empowered yourself by kicking her out at that stage. I would have been so proud if i was there. You deserve better and your husband should have stood up for you then.

If I was a guest, I would have told her to get out.", "NTA. Take it a step more and kick her out of your life. When she gets excited about seeing her future grandchildren, make certain she knows they will never know her.", "Nta. But this should have been stopped long ago. By your husband giving an ultimatum.", "NTA but it should have been your husband that kicked her out of it... Unless he just didn't have time to react? The fact he said nothing is kind of odd.
