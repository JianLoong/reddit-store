They make a lot of money and own a home in a very nice part of a very expensive city. They do have a 1 yo.\n\nI work for them as a front desk and insurance coordinator. I earn $22. That basically means I make $17.6 after tax. I\u2019ve been told I am the best \u201creceptionist\u201d the practice has had by patients. My sister and BIL have said that I do more work than I\u2019m paid right now. \n\nI\u2019m pretty educated, but have trouble with anxiety and depression. I grew up in this sort of dental environment and know a lot about anatomy, science, and software. But I don\u2019t have a full degree. \n\nAfter that context, I finally had enough money to but people nice gifts. The gifts I bought both of them and my niece amounted to over $200. They (together) bought me a 1oz (very nice, to be fair) perfume with a 20% off coupon, which amounted to $68. They bought a travel side of another scent for me to try and wanted to return if I didn\u2019t like it. \n\nIt made me kind of sad. I\u2019ve always wanted this perfume and I\u2019m glad I have it, but I thought maybe they would get me the bigger size with the discount. I would never buy it for myself, but I would buy more expensive things like that for others. \n\nEven my mom, who can barely afford much, gave my bf a nice bottle of whiskey and $200. But my own siblings who I work my ass off for (and they know it) couldn\u2019t get me more? I know they have a baby and it\u2019s hard. She\u2019s a sweetie and I love her, but she can be difficult. \n\nOn my birthday, my sister and BIL got me shoes. They didn\u2019t fit and they just returned them and left it at that. That also made me sad. \n\nSo WIBTA if I said anything to them about any of what I wrote especially with the birthday situation?\n\nTLDR: WIBTA if I mentioned anything to my rich siblings (and bosses) about how much I spent on their gifts compared to how much they spent on mine?", "created_utc": 1703569038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r0ycr/wibta_if_i_pointed_out_the_difference_in_gift/", "score": 26, "replies": ["\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice, This post has Poo Mod Activated. \ud83d\udca9\n\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough AITA subreddit comment karma are able to comment. **Must have 100 karma from the AITA subreddit.**\n\n If that doesn't include you, no worries!

Complaining because they didn't get you a bigger size is pretty ungrateful.", "YWBTA. If you give a gift and *expect* anything in return, it's not a gift. It's a transaction.\n\nIt would be absolutely appropriate for you to give them a gift and for them to give you nothing.

It's wrong to assess someone's supposed financial situation, and mentally assign a correct caliber of gifts. And the gift cost has nothing to do with your general satisfaction at work; you are conflating the two. For whatever the reason, you can't get a better job, but that doesn't mean they need to pay you more than the going rate for the position.", "YTA-It would come across as rude, ungrateful and petty to mention the financial comparison because it is rude, ungrateful and petty.

The fact that you\u2019re calculating estimated costs with discounts of what they bought you is really weird on your part. Projecting your expectations on what other people gift you is just setting yourself up for disappointment. Move on and be grateful for the gift.", "YWBTA, yes. \n\nIf the cost of your gift is more important to you than the sheer fact that someone thought enough of you to gift you ANYTHING, you've got some soul-searching to do.\n \nWhat they make and where they live are the results of the work they put into being what they are, it has NOTHING to do with the kind of gifts you expect them to give you. Big yuck.", "Yes, YWBTA. \n\nGifts aren't transactional. Give what you're comfortable giving and don't worry about the rest. It sounds like they also give you a way to make a living. In my state, you're making above the 75th %-ile for your position, and it's also higher than the average US salary range. So they're being good to you in that regard.  Plenty of people with large incomes also have large amounts of debt and it sounds like they may fall into that group. \n\nJust don't go there.", "YWBTA I\u2019d say something. Who cares how much it cost? They got you something you say you\u2019ve \u201calways wanted\u201d but because it isn\u2019t the right size and they used a discount you aren\u2019t happy? You should keep this to yourself, work on your attitude, and try to do better next year.", "Ywbtah. You\u2019re not an asshole to feel disappointed. But there\u2019s no reason to say something. In fact it\u2019s kind of rude. Personally I think an $60 gift from a sibling is a pretty good gift even if they\u2019re well off. I\u2019d never spend $200 on a sibling gift. I didn\u2019t even exchange gifts with my sibling this year. We just did gifts for each other\u2019s kids. We spend about 20-30$. \n\nGifts aren\u2019t something we\u2019re entitled to.", "YWBTA and your attitude makes YTA. Your post reeks of self pity.  Spend less on them next year if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s equal but holy nickel and diming when you\u2019re comparing paychecks and somehow know they used a coupon and are counting past presents.  The actual point of Christmas is not the monetary value of presents. It\u2019s not at all normal to just hand a child\u2019s significant other $200 + a present.  Your adult siblings don\u2019t owe you anything. Most adult sibling stop giving presents and I\u2019d suggest you do the same. \n\nI\u2019d suggest saving your money for therapy for your anxiety and depression and moving away from relying on them for a paycheck.\n\nHere\u2019s what our gifts looked like this year:  my brother sent my mom a small $50 Xmas tree, he got my dad a book. I got my mom a puzzle and socks and gloves from 5 below and traveled to see her.  I got my niece and nephew each a Lego set, about ~$30-$50 each.  My brother and I did not exchange gifts.  My dad got me a Trader Joe\u2019s gift card for $50.  I got my dad a $25 wallet and a book.  \n\nYou\u2019re spending too much and expecting too much."]}
