I got my mom a puzzle and socks and gloves from 5 below and traveled to see her.  I got my niece and nephew each a Lego set, about ~$30-$50 each.  My brother and I did not exchange gifts.

Don\u2019t over-perform and get yourself stuck working at 110% all the time. Give a good 80% effort, up it to 90-100 *occasionally*.

You\u2019re working in a professional field which requires professional licenses. *You don\u2019t even have a basic degree, let alone the necessary credentials for more.* So no, you\u2019re likely getting paid fairly.\n\nThird: believe people when they show you who they are. These people give decent gifts on sale and then demand their money back if you don\u2019t like it. Frankly, this is a common tactic for rich people, because they *understand* the value of money and they don\u2019t *waste* it on showy gifts. An $85 is fine. You, as a less wealthy person, don\u2019t even need to match that.\n\nFourth: if they don\u2019t even give you the cash value after returning a gift that doesn\u2019t fit, *stop giving them back gifts.* Most stores will give a gift card for the current price of the item if returned without a receipt.

Dentists are graduating with an average of $275,000 in debt and they are BOTH dentists. Furthermore, most dentists are not taught anything about the business side of running a practice and often operate at a loss and fail to pay themselves regularly while they learn how to become business owners. My father, who is at the top of his field, didn't even know he was underbilling dental insurance for 20 years until a competent office manager asked why he did things a certain way it was just because it was how he learned from his mentor.\n\nEven if you know their business is doing well from a profit standpoint (and the average dental practice proft in the states is 10% after owner's salary is compensated) you don't know their personal finances re: loans, childcare, and other obligations. Gift giving is not an obligation.\n\nThey could be drowning in debt or just paddling above water.\n\nBut either way, it doesn't matter.

Another way to think about this\u2026 What if they bought you that gift trying to anticipate the amount you might spend on them (since they know well how much you make)? In which case they were being conscientious of not embarrassing you by significantly outspending you in the gift exchange. \n\nMy family is a mix of very well off to not well off. We all try to keep gifts in a range that\u2019s reasonable for just that reason. It really is the thought and not the price. \n\nOP, I wonder if your frustration with the gift has more to do with your frustration with your situation (and working for your siblings). Why else mention all your qualifications and almost-qualifications. Just a thought.", "YTA - you\u2019re mad at the wrong person. I\u2019d be much more upset at my mom who can barely afford anything, for spending 200 bucks plus on my bf.", "ESH\n\nYou decided to gift them $200 worth of gifts. That's about $66 per person (sister, BIL, kid), so approximately what they gifted you. It sucks that as a single person or a childfree person you usually have to spend more on gifts, but that's life.\nIf you don't want to play this game anymore next year, just ask them in October or so if it's alright if you can stop giving gifts between adults. Many families do that once there are kids involved. That way you can buy something small for your niece and whatever perfume you like for yourself.\n\nAlso, your work life is your work life. If you feel underpaid, you'll have to go find work somewhere else, which you don't want, it seems. You entered a contract knowing what you will earn. Either ask for a raise or leave. Personally, I wouldn't want to work for my family, especially if they were my bosses. \n\nBesides, they got their dentistry degrees and carry the responsibility and risk of running a business, so it's justified that they earn more than you.\n\nNow, your sister and BIL returning the shoes that didn't fit and not giving you the store credit is pretty bizarre and I wonder if they just forgot or really didn't realise how rude this was. That's where they get the AH title. Also the thing about returning the travel size perfume and telling you that they got your gift with a discount. (Although, I understand in some cultures people are proud and share when they got a good deal.)\n\nI understand you're disappointed and we're hoping for more, but a gift is a gift. You get what people want to spend and think is appropriate, not what you think you deserve. I would either cut back on what I'm gifting them (for example, only bring flowers or a homemade cake to the next birthday) or have a chat with them about stopping the gift giving in general, so you can spend your money on yourself and the things you actually want.", "YTA\n\nComparing and tracking gift prices is tacky AF.", "Idk a lot of this seems self inflicted.", "I feel like you're not considering the mathematics of this well enough. Obviously, gifts for three people are going to cost more than gifts for one person. The amount that you spent on them, per person, is going to be fairly similar to the amount that they spent on you. Personally, I don't think it's necessary or reasonable to expect someone to buy an excessive amount of gifts for one person just to match what that person gave you. \n\nAlso dentistry is less lucrative than a lot of people think, mostly because running a practice costs a lot. Owning a nice house in a nice location is actually probably an even further strain on their finances, assuming that they have a mortgage to pay. And obviously qualifying as a dentist requires at least  5-8 years of university education (depending on what country you're in), so the student loans and years spent not working also take a toll. Maybe reconsider some of your assumptions about their financial status.\n\nAlso, stop using money to measure how much your family cares about you, and don't piss off your bosses. YWBTA.", "YTA. A gift is a gift. $68 is a lot. The cost of living has gone up, their fancy house in the fancy area is probably costing them a lot, their baby is costing them a lot. Christmas and general is costing people a lot. If you want to spend $200 on gifts while on a lower income that is your choice but you're not the gifting police and can't tell others how much they have to gift based off their income. They're choosing to be smart with their money and anything over $50 in my eyes is generous.\n\nI know you say it's an effort thing but maybe be grateful they even remember which perfume it was you've been wanting. It's better to give a thoughtful gift than an expensive one.", "Ywbta. Nobody\u2019s owed a gift.  If they were , it would be a debt!   So accept gifts graciously.  Some gifts are better than others, but that should be judged on the appropriateness for the person, not on monetary value.  Gift giving isn\u2019t a competition.  You can choose what you spend on gifts you give, it\u2019s entirely your own choice.", "Already YTA for feeling and thinking this way. You'll be a much bigger AH if you say something. Some things to think about:\n\n\\-- You said this was the first year you could get people nice Xmas presents. Does that mean every other year they outspent you on gifts? Do they have a yearly tradition of telling you how much they spent on your gifts and implying you owed them more? How dare you, after years of benefitting from their spending more than you, act like they owe you something because you unilaterally decided to up the budget once?\n\n\\-- The average usual rate for a receptionist in the US is $15-23 per hour, with the average being a little less than $19. At $22 you are at the high end of that. You bring it up as though they're shortchanging you, when in fact you're paid far more than the average person with your job. If you resent them for not flooding your pockets with unearned cash by paying you twice what a receptionist should earn, that's pretty awful of you. And if they said something positive about your work ethic, as a compliment, that's not an invitation for you to infer a  contractual obligation to pay you even more.\n\n\\-- Repeat after me: \"I am not entitled to other people's money just because they have more than me.\"\n\n\\-- Gift giving is supposed to come from you heart. When you constantly compare yourself to others in terms of what they gift, you're being unfair to both of them. When you obsessively price-match, you're reaching the point where you need therapy for this fixation with their money.\n\n\\-- You probably have no idea how much of their income is disposable income. How much student debt they pay each month, what  their mortgage is, what their medical expenses add up to, etc. I mean, even if you did, you'd still be an AH.", "YWBTA. A gift is a gift. If you dont like the prices buy cheaper things.", "YWBTA - while I do understand your frustrations (this year, my husband and I bought some lovely gifts for his parents and in return, we got a cheap box of chocolates to share), it\u2019s just not appropriate for you to complain to them about how much they\u2019ve spent vs how much you\u2019ve spent. \n\nMy mom always used to say \u201cyou don\u2019t give to receive\u201d. If you aren\u2019t happy with the imbalance, then spend less going forward.", ">I work for them as a front desk and insurance coordinator. I earn $22. That basically means I make $17.6 after tax. I\u2019ve been told I am the best \u201creceptionist\u201d the practice has had by patients. My sister and BIL have said that I do more work than I\u2019m paid right now.\nI\u2019m pretty educated, but have trouble with anxiety and depression. I grew up in this sort of dental environment and know a lot about anatomy, science, and software. But I don\u2019t have a full degree.\n\n\n\nThe average wage for a dental receptionist is 17-20 an hour before taxes. You already make above average money without having a degree. If you feel like you are being undervalued then you should bring that up with them or find a job that pays better. But it seems like they are already paying you more than you could find otherwise, especially without a finished degree.\n\n\n\n\nWhat they got you for Christmas has nothing to do with you working for them. About $60 per person on gifts is a normal amount to spend on sibling presents. They don\u2019t owe you more because they make more than you.", "NTA. Find another job because this isn't healthy. Because you work for them, they don't consider you an equal in the family either. That is why you are afraid to say anything to your own sister - you are afraid of losing your job.", "YWNBTA, but there is a better way to handle this in the future instead of doing what you suggest. I have also siblings and when we were all adults and children were born, we stopped giving each other Christmas presents and only give the children presents. It was mainly to have less stress with gift shopping. Buying numerous gifts for your own children and nephews and nieces are already enough work. Make this suggestion to reduce gift buying stress. Tell them that you will buy in the future only your niece a present for Christmas and that they of course don't have to buy you a gift either.\n\nThe imbalance between their family of three and you might grow even bigger if they will get another child in the not too far away future and if you are still single by then. So that really works in your favor. Just suggest buying only gifts for the children of each other in the future.\n\nAnd it is fine to not be super generous especially if you are not rich. Next year your niece will only be 2 either way. She won't know the worth of stuff yet. You don't have to spend more than 30 - 50 dollar on her.", "YTA and so ungrateful. Next time, expect nothing and maybe you won\u2019t be disappointed. You\u2019re not entitled to anything from them at all. Spending exorbitant amounts of your own money on others is entirely your choice and you cannot hold other people to a standard you set for yourself. The gift they gave you is even one you WANT. But it\u2019s not BIG ENOUGH? Grow up.", "YTA and materialistic.", "YWBTA\n\nI can feel your disappointment seeping through your post so I guess you are hurting. But gifts should not be transactional. It should not be about the value of the gift. If you are feeling like the balance is off, then just spend less on the gifts you give them in the future.\n\nIf you think you are underpaid, you should have that conversation with them about that separately. OR find a different job where your skills will be fairly compensated. But working for them and getting gifts from them are separate issues.", "Yes - don\u2019t bring it up.", "YTA. You got what you wanted. No one forced you or your mom to buy expensive gifts and than be mad you got less expensive things", "NTA Yes you can mention pricing but I don\u2019t see the point. Your sister\u2019s family do not spend a lot on you so scale it back for them. They will not spend more just because you ask them. \n\nIf you must mention it, I suggest something like, \u201cHey did the store give you a gift card for those shoes? Can I have it because I could do with a new pair.\u201d\n\nOr a more general conversation like, \u201cDo you think we should have a gift pricing limit next year for Christmas? What would be fair given that there is 2 of us and 3 of you?\u201d\n\nI have gone through this with my millionaire uncle. Over the years the gifts have become cheaper and cheaper to almost non-existent. Like a $7 piece of cake for me when I spend $100 on him. This year I turned it into a game. I asked myself what is the cheapest gift I could find to come under whatever he would buy me? I came up with a packet of gourmet pasta $8 and received a drink bottle $19 keep cup. Pretty happy that I won Christmas this year!", "YWBTA.\n\nSeparate your work life from your home life. You did not receive this gift at work as a work present so stop mixing these two feelings.\n\nYou ARE getting taken advantage of in the work space but that\u2019s not a conversation that should take place at family Christmas or factored into gift costs. STOP DOING EXTRA; this coming from someone who got burned out doing the same thing at my last job and who suffers from depression and people pleasing. You need to get a degree to either be justified being paid more or to be able to move to a higher paying job in the practice like a dental hygienist (you mention knowledge in anatomy).\n\nGifting always sucks as a single income earner. You can\u2019t be as fancy as people who have two earners as you don\u2019t have the disposable income. I make up for dollar value with thoughtfulness value. My dad and FFIL love love snacks so I picked out snacks they like (and what the wives don\u2019t want to buy for the household!) My mom and FMIL love cozy cute things so I bought them fun socks and cozy slippers.\n\nI\u2019m extremely curious how you knew they used a coupon? Also since you say you suffer from anxiety, did you ever follow up about the shoes? Typically you the recipient does the returning with a gift receipt or tags along so the correct item can be picked up.", "I get where you are coming from but this is not a discussion to be had with them.  Anything you say will be used against you to justify what has been done and it will make things very uncomfortable at work.\n\nThey probably are underpaying you if you are doing work that is outside the scope of your job.  Don't do it, or they can pay you appropriately.  \n\nI would be looking for work elsewhere so there is a degree of separation between you.  Your sister and BIL know exactly what you are making and you may be underpaid in general so you need to find out what others doing your job get paid.  If there are others in the practice, I would ask them for a reference because your sister is not going to want to let you go to someone else because they likely know what a good deal they are getting with you working for them.\n\nAs for the presents... you give gifts because you want to, not give and expect the same amount back.  No one said that you have to spend $200 on them all.  Spend what you are happy to spend and thrifted (some are like new) or home made gifts are fine.\n\nSay nothing about the cost of your gift v's their's.  They are either rich because they hang onto their money, they may also not realise you know exactly how much these things cost, or they haven't got as much disposable cash as you think.  They may own an expensive house... but they may also have a large mortgage they are servicing.", "YTA. It\u2019s hard when people don\u2019t put the same effort or thought into gifts as you, but gifts are just that. You need to separate your work from your personal life - if you don\u2019t feel you are paid appropriately then that is a separate issue. This is why it\u2019s never a good idea to work for family.", "YTA. Look, I have people in my family who makes much more than me and are very stingy with money. It is just the way they are wired, and the gifts they get to other people reflect that. But nobody is entitled to better gifts from them just because they have more money. We are not entitled to other people's money or gifts, so leave it at that. Enjoy your perfume and that's it. Regarding your employment, if you are not happy with the money you make, talk to them in a professional setting and in a professional way, or look for other options. But both things you say here are not related. They are giving you gifts in a personal capacity, and in their office you are their employee. Your disatisfaction with your gifts should not be discussed, as nobody is forced to give you anything. If you don't like their gifts, stop getting them ones and they will stop giving you things. And the question of your salary should be discussed in a professional setting and with you getting information about realistic expectations for that and the rest of your employment realistic possibilities if you decide to leave for a better paid job.", "You're upset because you didn't get better gifts from your employer? Duude, YTA. They owe you nothing.", "So you sister and bil went to  college and dental school, opened their own practice and offered you a job at a pretty typical entry level receptionist rate , you probably didn\u2019t even have to compete with other applicants, and you thank them how??  By talking bad about them and their baby. Yeah, YWBTA. \nI take it you don\u2019t have a clue what paying off years of college costs for both of them + opening a dental practice and earning little profit until you build the practice up, which takes at least a few years, raising a child, paying childcare, etc, etc.  I\u2019m guessing you live at home still, and so most of this is foreign to you. Gratitude should be included in your resolution for next year. \nGrow up and ask for a raise if you think you deserve it and if you don\u2019t get it, take your skills elsewhere. And don\u2019t spend so much on gifts if you\u2019re going to be a jerk about it one second later.", "A soft YTA.... My question is, why did you spend so much on their gifts when you didn't have to?", "It sounds like you overworked give your employer the best because their family.\n\nAnd they don't reciprocate.\n\nIt's time to move on.  Even if you are working with a different company that gives you the exact same resources you'll be able to mentally let it go at the door when you leave more than you will working for family.\n\nAnd then with the gifts and the future keep adding up level that you can afford that reciprocates what you feel is appropriate for your relationship and what is spent on you.", "Despite being long-term unemployed, I once spent $150 on a Christmas present for my sister. She was employed and in a relationship at the time. Know what she got me? Nothing. \n\nKnow why I didn't care? Because she's my sister and a gift is not a transaction. It is something you bestow because you want to. No one forced you to spend so much on them, you chose to spend that much. \n\nThis year, between her partner, herself and their sons, I spent... oh... almost $250? They probably spent less than $50 on me. I still don't care. \n\nBut do you really know the state of their fiances? They're both dentists, which from what I've heard is a good job, though not lucrative. You say they have a big house and a one year old, plus an employee: you. How do you know they have the money to burn you think they do? In this day and age, the cost of their mortgage plus the rental for their dental practice is likely through the roof, never mind the rest. \n\n\\> On my birthday, my sister and BIL got me shoes. They didn\u2019t fit and they just returned them and left it at that. That also made me sad.\n\nThat is sad, I agree. It sucks. It's why I'm going to vote ESH, instead of Y T A. But I think you should engage in some self-reflection and figure out if your resentment is justified, or if you're simply feeling unfulfilled in your own and jealous that 'they have all this and I have nothing'. You don't know what their day-to-day is, you don't know what their problems are. You're looking through a window at their lives and making up your own story.", "Good sensible response.", "My only disagreement here is that there aren\u2019t any degrees or credentials needed for OP\u2019s work, yet their hourly pay is definitely on the lower end for their position.", "Enable response. YTA op for the reasons mentioned above. Get a degree.", "\n\"She\u2019s a sweetie and I love her, but she can be difficult.\"\n\nShe is a baby. She is one year old. She cannot be difficult to you in any way shape or form.", "Agreed, plus \"if never buy expensive perfume for myself but if buy more expensive gifts for others\"? Why? You're spending money you can't comfortably afford to buy things for people who could easily afford to spend that much on themselves.\n\nIt's so inefficient to put all your spare money into gifts then expect people to buy you what you really want. Buy yourself a treat, get them something small.", "I think that's a little unfair to say. They got her a gift that she had been thinking of buying, they put some thought into it.\n\nAnd OP said she suffers from anxiety and depression, so the job might fit well to her. She could ask for a raise but commenting that they are cheap gifters is a bit much.\n\nPeople should stop gifting with the expectation of receiving a better gift.", "Also maybe sister and BIL spend less on gifts for OP because they know she can\u2019t afford large gifts in return and want to keep things even? Not in a bad way but of not pressuring OP to spend a lot to compete. I don\u2019t agree with this thinking but it does cross my mind when buying my little brother presents. I bought him a $125 cologne this year and asked for nothing in return because I know I make a bit more than he does and he just moved out of my parents so I know he\u2019s a little tight for money. But the key here is I discussed that with my brother and still bought him something nice because I wanted to. Sister and OP need to communicate more.", ">That's about $66 per person (sister, BIL, kid), so approximately what they gifted you. \n\nActually mathematically her sister gave her a $34 gift and her BIL gave her a $34 gift. As they are both individuals and not merged into one person just because they are married, they were each half as generous as OP.\n\nThough I agree they should just stopping giving each other Christmas gifts from now on and just give the children presents. OP definitely should make that happen.", "Yeah, the \u2018gift value per person\u2019 is important here. I agree with you.", "Gift value per person is stupid. One person giving three people one gift isn\u2019t the same thing as two people giving one person a gift. If I spend 5 dollars on person A and 5 on person B and 5 on the child of A and B then it makes sense than person A and B should contribute at least 10 dollars if not 15 dollars on a gift to me. They have two incomes. I have one. They are three people. You can\u2019t just act like \u201cwell the dollar amounts each person is getting is the same so it\u2019s fair\u201d. You\u2019re ignoring the source of the gifts. You don\u2019t get to be like \u201cwell the gift I got was 5 dollars and the gift my spouse got was 5 dollars so collectively we should each only contribute 2.5 for a return gift\u201d.", "Also, OPs 'they're rich, they can afford it' attitude is creeping out in her post. Don't be that person.", "*THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE*", "Yeh it feels generous - and also not that far off what she spends\u2026 $200 split 3 ways is ~$60-70 each. You do gift budgets per person not per household normally. I spend more on my brothers household than my sisters because there are more of them? I also get the least spent on my household because I don\u2019t have kids. I have never even thought of it before. But also spend less if it\u2019s putting strain on your finances and making you resentful. They got you a nice gift that you wanted. Youre not entitled to their money because they have well paid jobs.", "I'm glad I'm not the only one. \n\nReddit over the holidays has made me think my family is strange in that no gifts are exchanged between siblings. And niblings get mainly token gifts and are cut off at 18. So while I'm online to avoid the family holiday drama, none of that drama has anything to do with gift exchanges.", "Agree with the idea of therapy - does your insurance cover it? If not, could your employers/siblings increase your insurance on lieu of a payrise? You need to find a way to not need to work for them anymore.\n\nYou are giving champagne gifts on a beer budget. This is your choice. Your sibling/s are not impressed and their child definitely isn't. If you are trying to curry favour by spending more than you can afford, it won't work and simply makes you a martyr. You mentioned your mum does the same for your bf, so perhaps you have learned from her example. You and she can both UNlearn what you think gift giving means, because you are really doing it wrong.\n\nYou may also want to sit with your parent/s and sibling/s and set some ground rules for gift budgets going forward. Set an expectation amongst everyone in the family for both Christmas and birthdays and stick to it.
