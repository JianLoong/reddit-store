I got my mom a puzzle and socks and gloves from 5 below and traveled to see her.  I got my niece and nephew each a Lego set, about ~$30-$50 each.  My brother and I did not exchange gifts.

Accept that they don't spend much and adjust expectations and your own spending if it makes it feel more equal.\n\nRequest a pay rise, in writing, with reminders of how they say you're the best and aren't paid enough for the work you do.\n\nKeep your personal and professional lives separate", "Omg, ok.\n\nFirst: work is work. Don\u2019t over-perform and get yourself stuck working at 110% all the time. Give a good 80% effort, up it to 90-100 *occasionally*.

You\u2019re working in a professional field which requires professional licenses. *You don\u2019t even have a basic degree, let alone the necessary credentials for more.* So no, you\u2019re likely getting paid fairly.\n\nThird: believe people when they show you who they are. These people give decent gifts on sale and then demand their money back if you don\u2019t like it. Frankly, this is a common tactic for rich people, because they *understand* the value of money and they don\u2019t *waste* it on showy gifts. An $85 is fine. You, as a less wealthy person, don\u2019t even need to match that.\n\nFourth: if they don\u2019t even give you the cash value after returning a gift that doesn\u2019t fit, *stop giving them back gifts.* Most stores will give a gift card for the current price of the item if returned without a receipt.

Dentists are graduating with an average of $275,000 in debt and they are BOTH dentists. Furthermore, most dentists are not taught anything about the business side of running a practice and often operate at a loss and fail to pay themselves regularly while they learn how to become business owners. My father, who is at the top of his field, didn't even know he was underbilling dental insurance for 20 years until a competent office manager asked why he did things a certain way it was just because it was how he learned from his mentor.\n\nEven if you know their business is doing well from a profit standpoint (and the average dental practice proft in the states is 10% after owner's salary is compensated) you don't know their personal finances re: loans, childcare, and other obligations. Gift giving is not an obligation.\n\nThey could be drowning in debt or just paddling above water.\n\nBut either way, it doesn't matter.

Another way to think about this\u2026 What if they bought you that gift trying to anticipate the amount you might spend on them (since they know well how much you make)? In which case they were being conscientious of not embarrassing you by significantly outspending you in the gift exchange. \n\nMy family is a mix of very well off to not well off. We all try to keep gifts in a range that\u2019s reasonable for just that reason. It really is the thought and not the price. \n\nOP, I wonder if your frustration with the gift has more to do with your frustration with your situation (and working for your siblings). Why else mention all your qualifications and almost-qualifications. Just a thought.", "YTA - you\u2019re mad at the wrong person. I\u2019d be much more upset at my mom who can barely afford anything, for spending 200 bucks plus on my bf.", "ESH\n\nYou decided to gift them $200 worth of gifts. That's about $66 per person (sister, BIL, kid), so approximately what they gifted you. It sucks that as a single person or a childfree person you usually have to spend more on gifts, but that's life.\nIf you don't want to play this game anymore next year, just ask them in October or so if it's alright if you can stop giving gifts between adults. Many families do that once there are kids involved. That way you can buy something small for your niece and whatever perfume you like for yourself.\n\nAlso, your work life is your work life. If you feel underpaid, you'll have to go find work somewhere else, which you don't want, it seems. You entered a contract knowing what you will earn. Either ask for a raise or leave. Personally, I wouldn't want to work for my family, especially if they were my bosses. \n\nBesides, they got their dentistry degrees and carry the responsibility and risk of running a business, so it's justified that they earn more than you.\n\nNow, your sister and BIL returning the shoes that didn't fit and not giving you the store credit is pretty bizarre and I wonder if they just forgot or really didn't realise how rude this was. That's where they get the AH title. Also the thing about returning the travel size perfume and telling you that they got your gift with a discount. (Although, I understand in some cultures people are proud and share when they got a good deal.)\n\nI understand you're disappointed and we're hoping for more, but a gift is a gift. You get what people want to spend and think is appropriate, not what you think you deserve. I would either cut back on what I'm gifting them (for example, only bring flowers or a homemade cake to the next birthday) or have a chat with them about stopping the gift giving in general, so you can spend your money on yourself and the things you actually want.", "YTA\n\nComparing and tracking gift prices is tacky AF.", "Idk a lot of this seems self inflicted.", "I feel like you're not considering the mathematics of this well enough. Obviously, gifts for three people are going to cost more than gifts for one person. The amount that you spent on them, per person, is going to be fairly similar to the amount that they spent on you. Personally, I don't think it's necessary or reasonable to expect someone to buy an excessive amount of gifts for one person just to match what that person gave you. \n\nAlso dentistry is less lucrative than a lot of people think, mostly because running a practice costs a lot. Owning a nice house in a nice location is actually probably an even further strain on their finances, assuming that they have a mortgage to pay. And obviously qualifying as a dentist requires at least  5-8 years of university education (depending on what country you're in), so the student loans and years spent not working also take a toll. Maybe reconsider some of your assumptions about their financial status.\n\nAlso, stop using money to measure how much your family cares about you, and don't piss off your bosses. YWBTA.", "YTA. A gift is a gift. $68 is a lot. The cost of living has gone up, their fancy house in the fancy area is probably costing them a lot, their baby is costing them a lot. Christmas and general is costing people a lot. If you want to spend $200 on gifts while on a lower income that is your choice but you're not the gifting police and can't tell others how much they have to gift based off their income. They're choosing to be smart with their money and anything over $50 in my eyes is generous.\n\nI know you say it's an effort thing but maybe be grateful they even remember which perfume it was you've been wanting. It's better to give a thoughtful gift than an expensive one.", "Ywbta. Nobody\u2019s owed a gift.  If they were , it would be a debt!   So accept gifts graciously.  Some gifts are better than others, but that should be judged on the appropriateness for the person, not on monetary value.  Gift giving isn\u2019t a competition.  You can choose what you spend on gifts you give, it\u2019s entirely your own choice.", "Already YTA for feeling and thinking this way. You'll be a much bigger AH if you say something. Some things to think about:\n\n\\-- You said this was the first year you could get people nice Xmas presents. Does that mean every other year they outspent you on gifts? Do they have a yearly tradition of telling you how much they spent on your gifts and implying you owed them more? How dare you, after years of benefitting from their spending more than you, act like they owe you something because you unilaterally decided to up the budget once?\n\n\\-- The average usual rate for a receptionist in the US is $15-23 per hour, with the average being a little less than $19. At $22 you are at the high end of that. You bring it up as though they're shortchanging you, when in fact you're paid far more than the average person with your job. If you resent them for not flooding your pockets with unearned cash by paying you twice what a receptionist should earn, that's pretty awful of you. And if they said something positive about your work ethic, as a compliment, that's not an invitation for you to infer a  contractual obligation to pay you even more.\n\n\\-- Repeat after me: \"I am not entitled to other people's money just because they have more than me.\"\n\n\\-- Gift giving is supposed to come from you heart. When you constantly compare yourself to others in terms of what they gift, you're being unfair to both of them.

You don't seem to be the type to bring it up with someone directly if you're bothered by something they did, so if you never asked after them again, this situation is a wash as far as \"fault.\" You probably should have just gone to exchange the shoes yourself, as most people do when they receive a gift they can't use. \n\n2.

From here you have a choice on how to proceed at future holidays.\n\nWhat I do have problems with is when couples give a single person a gift worth one of (or less than) a regular gift that particular family is in the habit of giving each other when they each get a gift in return and you are NTA for noticing the inequality in this instance. If this is your first time being able to splurge then consider it a lesson learned. Unless you get a whole lot of joy from giving presents, I'd recommend giving the *couple* a gift in line with the type of gift they give you. Give just one if they think you only get one from them as a couple-unit.  As for birthdays, you should again be getting a gift from each if you gift them each something on their day. Don't go 20 or 30 years of giving your BIL a gift if you know your sister is the only one getting you one on your Bday. Either just gift your sister or get them individually something worth about 1/2 of what they collectively give you. Your money and effort in finding individual gifts should NOT be double what your family individually spends on you. Transactional? Yeah, but if they actually notice *you* doing it and disregard what they are doing without even a second thought, that would be hypocritical. Just decide on a course of action, implement, and let this one go.  \nYou may also consider making a change in your employment. Working with family has the hazard that they might see you more as employee than as family.", "NTA for feeling that way but don\u2019t mention it. They seem cheap and a lot of people with money are. I think the fact that you work for them does change things (especially in a small business like this) I can only imagine the favours you do for them (evident in your post). You need to move on from working for them. Find a place you are valued but more importantly so you can seperate work from family. Then next year tone down the gifts a lot.", "YWBTA. But maybe don't spend as much money in the future. If you match what they give you there will be no animosity from anyone.", "This comes across as self entitled. \"They make a lot of money so they should spend a lot on my presents!!!!\" If someone complained that my gift to them wasn't good enough or expensive enough, I wouldn't buy them any more gifts. \n\nThe pay situation,  ask for a raise. Bring up all the commebts about how much they value you. If they don't agree, secretly start looking for a better job. Then, when you find one, use it as leverage to get a raise if you want to stay", "YTA, you sound really entitled to someone else\u2019s money. I grew up with my mom telling me be thankful for everything you get. If someone came to me saying I didn\u2019t spend enough money on them, I would take back my gift and you would never get anything from me again.", "Maybe you should just stop doing gifts for adults and just do gifts for the child?", "NTA for that. But I get the impression you don\u2019t feel valued by them. If you weren\u2019t getting compensated what you are worth, you need to have a conversation with them or find employment elsewhere. With your skills and level of experience, maybe you can parlay that into a better job somewhere else.", "YWBTA for discussing presents and gift giving. People give a combination of what they can and what they want. You don't get to adjust this.\n\nIf you wanted to exchange the shoes for a different size, you should have gone to the store yourself to exchange them instead of involving your sister.\n\nNow, if you want to discuss your pay at your job because you do 2 roles and you believe you are worth more than you should research both roles rates, with proof, figure out what % of your time you spend in each role and calculate your rate as that % blended.\n\nGood luck!", "YWBTA.\n\nIt doesn't sound like they cheaped out- they got you something that you wanted. I don't know about the birthday gift; did they not actually give you a gift?\n\nRegarding the other things- if you think you deserve a raise for the extra stuff you do, ask. The gift stuff is separate from the work stuff. If you can't separate those, you probably should try to get a new job.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH. I think your feelings are hurt and believe me I know what it feels like.  Next year, give small token gifts and save your money. I can guarantee they don\u2019t appreciate your effort (or your worth). How do I know? For context: I gave each of my grandsons $150 each for Christmas, my SIL $100 and my daughter a $150 gift which she told me she didn\u2019t like. So, asked her to return it and sent her cash.

But I think you WBTA if you said something. Instead, take heed of this for future. And consider how much the relationship goes both ways or one way in general.

You\u2019re a nice looking, thin, young-ish (28yo) blonde. Quit self-harming, & marry rich. Get your sister, & BIL to introduce you to some of their dentist friends if the current boyfriend is poor.

Don't mention it though, but in the future don't overspend on gifts, just get them something you can afford (or make a deal you won't buy gifts to each other). \n\nGenerally, you should gift what you can afford and want to and not think about what you get in return. I do think sometimes some people get really bad / cheap gifts to hurt the recipient, but here, there's no evidence of that and you actually got nice gifts, so it's best to not dwell in your disappointment.", "Info: Do you know what your sister and BIL have in their bank account? Do you know if they have student loans to pay off? Finances tied up in the business?

Don't get them expensive gifts if you're going to be disappointed that their gift isn't as valuable. \n\nOn the other hand, seems like your sister & BIL are cheap and undervalue you. \n\nSeems like the real issue isn't the value of the gifts but that overall, you feel undervalued. \n\nOnly way to change that is to speak up and let them know how undervalued you feel for the amount of work you do, and be prepared to move on if they are not willing to listen. \n\nBest of luck to you, OP", ">If you don't want to play this game anymore next year, just ask them in October or so if it's alright if you can stop giving gifts between adults. Many families do that once there are kids involved. That way you can buy something small for your niece and whatever perfume you like for yourself.\n\n\nVery easy solution. My family does this, all the kids names in each household that wants to participate goes into a bowl and they draw a name for each kid they have. Grandma generally gets something small for all the children. All the kids get something to open, it's all relatively inexpensive (basically a $25-30 limit on gifts), and there is no weirdness about disproportionate gifts.", "100%.
