My older sister \"Amanda\" (F25 and my mom (F54) are prone to barging into my room unannounced. I have told them many times to please knock and close the door when they leave and has recently been getting a little better but still not there yet. \n\nI have been struggling with diagnosed depression and severe anxiety and panic attacks. I used to take medication, but my mom took it away last year (different story), as well as taking me out of therapy - I don't have many friends and do not really have a constructive outlet to let my emotions process properly, so usually I have to bottle it up and end up exploding (I know it's not healthy).\n\nBasically, my mom made an appointment for me to get my haircut 3 days ago and gave me her credit card to pay with. When I came home, I remember returning the card and receipt to her and went upstairs. The next day, she said her card was missing and I was the last one who had it. I emptied my wallet to show her it wasn't there, and she asked me to please look for it - I spent hours cleaning my room to find it and I didn't, so I said again that I remember handing it to her when I returned, she asked me to keep looking. This repeated 4 times.\n\nThis morning (Christmas Eve) | was not feeling my best already because I have been alone (my friends and boyfriend were busy with their families) for the past 2 days, and my mom comes in my room demanding I search again for her card, waking me up and leaving my door wide open when she left. I got up and angrily shut my door (not slammed or anything just closed a little loudly). Amanda took it upon herself to barge into my room and say \"Let me help you look through your stuff to find mom's card.\" I declined many times, knowing it wasn't anywhere I had already looked at 4 times already. She persisted, sitting in my chair and grabbing my bags to go through them. I snatched my stuff away and told her to leave again and she refused.\n\nI know the way I acted here was unacceptable, but I have said multiple times politely already for her to leave and was becoming frustrated. I yelled at her to get out, and my mom came back in yelling at me for \"being uncooperative\". I started to cry and scream more - I was just asking to be left alone.\n\nEventually, my mom picked up the outfit I wore to the haircut and found her card in my pants pocket, then accused me of stealing and gaslighting her. I genuinely believed I had returned the card, and that was in the part of my room I had not cleaned through yet. I apologized, saying I didn't know it was there, and now that it's found can you all please leave me alone. \n\nI did finally get them to leave, and they threw snide remarks at me saying I was overreacting to someone being in my room (uninvited). I was only asking that they didn't disrupt my safe space, and now my door has to stay open and I\u2019m not allowed to leave until my room is clean. All I want is an apology from Amanda - AITA?", "created_utc": 1671927818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zumjyl/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_sister_and_mom_after/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are times a person can be so convinced they\u2019ve done something they haven\u2019t that they believe it\u2019s real. This is a common thing because brains do that.\n\nBut what people usually do when they\u2019re proven wrong is apologize and make amends because no matter how you *feel* because of what you thought, you\u2019re still in the wrong. \n\nInstead you doubled down and tantrummed even though you looked literally everywhere but your own pockets. And it\u2019s a big deal because it\u2019s a credit card. Identity theft, maybe? Major doofus stuff. Own up, say you\u2019re sorry, and learn a lesson here.", "YTA I find it hard to believe that you cleaned your room as thoroughly as you claim if it was then found in your pants pocket in your room.", "YTA. And all your mom was asked is that you take care with her credit card. Her credit card trumps your privacy.", "YTA how can you have looked 4 times but also there was a section of the room that you hadn\u2019t looked through yet which included the clothes you had been wearing when it got lost\u2026. I understand depression is hard and you need to start going to therapy, use your money for that. But your logic doesn\u2019t make sense here", "YTA. You are an adult. You need to act like one. If you don\u2019t like living there, move. You can make your own appointments and handle your own medications. You were wrong about the card, that was your fault. If you genuinely are having a problem remembering things you need to go to the doctor.

I'm not saying you did it purposely or maliciously, but YOU had the card, so you SHOULD be blamed.", "Yes you are the a******.  Your title is misleading because your mom didn't lose her credit card, you left it in your pocket. That's on you. \nSo a couple of things here. Obviously it's a different story but being 19, you shouldn't let your mom control if you go to therapy or the medication that you take, so you should probably fix that ASAP because you're grown and it's your body.\nNumber 2, not sure why your mom didn't have a second or 3rd credit card. Most people have more than one. \n\nNumber 3, how messy is your room.  I know teenagers are overall messy, but you need to really be more organized so you don't have piles of clothes all over the place.\n\nNumber 4 although this is your mom's house but if they're that intrusive, why don't you just get a lock on your door. I would suggest moving out but something tells me that's not feasible for you at the moment.\n You should apologize to your mother about the misunderstanding but then express how you don't like them coming into your room and working on overall communication.. BTW, why does your 25 year old sister live at home still.", "You cleaned four whole times and missed an entire section of your room all four times?? And you didn\u2019t bother to check the pants you were wearing that day? And it was loose in your pockets, not in your wallet? You were disrespectful of your mom\u2019s card at so many points here and you half-assed looking for it. Apologise to your mom and take accountability for the fact that you fucked up here. The tone of your post and your replies has a lot of arrogance here, you don\u2019t really seem sorry for misplacing it.

Give your family a little grace for their understandable panic, and give yourself a little grace in that making a mistake ONLY reflects poorly on you if you don\u2019t take responsibility. If you consistently refuse to take responsibility for mistakes, even if they\u2019re accidental, then unfortunately you would be TA.\n\nI\u2019m so so sorry you\u2019re not able to access the mental health resources you need. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to see that the understandable effect of this is lashing out and melting down. I hope you\u2019re able to find a healthy outlet for your frustration. I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re located, but in the US you can call the SAMHSA hotline for help accessing local, confidential, (and sometimes free) mental health resources.

You\u2019ve got some issues you need more work on.", "You need help.  Why did your mother take you out of therapy and stop your medication?", "YTA, obviously. YOU DIDN\u2019T GIVE THE CARD BACK", "You are 19 years old. You are in charge of your mental health. Your mother cannot take your medications from you and refuse you the treatment you need just because she doesn\u2019t want you to have it. This is seriously neglect, but you\u2019re old enough to put your foot down and to stand up to her for this. Make your own appointments and let your health professional know that you do not want them giving information out to her when you sign the privacy notice.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get an apology from them even though you made a genuine mistake. However, I do think you need to start looking into an escape route and moving into your own place.\n\nNTA.", "ESH. \n\nYou: massively overreacted AND were proven wrong. \n\nYour mum: took you off your meds and pulled you out of therapy. I feel like that\u2019s contributing to some of the larger issues you seem to have with control.", "ESH. Neither your mother nor sister would have been bothering you in the first place had you actually given the card back. You thinking you gave the card back means nothing when you actually did not. It\u2019s not your card, it was your responsibility to look for it until you found it. You don\u2019t get to tell someone to leave you alone over something that belongs to them that they want back.", "Sorry, I can't get past the fact that your mother took away your medication?!", "NAH except maybe your sister for insisting on staying until you blew up at her.\n\nYour mom freaking out makes sense and it sounds like you made an honest mistake. Worst case scenario, most card companies take care of any issues and many let you easily lock your card so no one can use it if it gets lost or stolen. So the urgency was there but also wasn't worth it becoming a big issue.\n\nThe lukewarm take of \"it's her house and therefore you don't deserve privacy\" is INSANE to me; if it's your room, your space where all your things are and you spend more time in it than anyone else, of course you deserve privacy and for that to be respected. Sure technically your mom has the right to walk into any room in her own house at any time, but then she'd be an AH for acting like your landlord instead of like your mom. Knocking and announcing before entering is not a big ask.\n\nFinally, on mental illness: Stigma against mental illness unfortunately extends to the way your loved ones treat you. Also, mental illnesses can affect your working memory. Because you thought about returning the card, you created a fake memory for that most likely scenario. Be more careful next time. Don't put something valuable like that in a pants pocket; a wallet or bag pocket is better.\n\nAnd good luck. As another commentor said, you are an adult and your mom can't take your meds away from you.", "NTA.  You might look into getting a lock for your door, or maybe a door wedge to keep them out while you're home.\n\n> I used to take medication, but my mom took it away last year (different story), as well as taking me out of therapy\n\nAs soon as I saw this, I fully expected either your mom or sister to have planted the card in your room.", "I'm in-between YTA and ESH. This is your mom's house right? Do you contribute to live there, work, or go to school? If the answer is no, you have no say in what goes on in that house or who comes into your room (technically your mom's room). However, if you pay any sort of rent (lease agreement or verbal), they are not to enter your room w/o your permission. You did have your mom's card. That's kind of an important detail. I believe that you didn't steal it, however, you did not make a great enough effort to look for it. Then you swore to your mom that you did. This is what makes you TA and not them. Them not respecting your boundaries can make them TA, but this time they had good reason.\n\nEDIT: NTA due to OP paying rent and this being an honest mistake.", "NTA. It was in a pants pocket, it would have been found sooner or later. It sounds like they don't respect your privacy and while I think the situation could have been handled better from every party (which you already acknowledged), you letting out your emotions is not an asshole-worthy behavior in this situation. Memory is failable, and an invasion of personal privacy is enough to set someone over the edge when you're already not doing well as it is.", "Because I have been responding to all comments, I will just make a post that hopefully will get to the top so others see it. Hi I am OP (alternate account on accident, signed in on laptop differently than phone and just started responding that\u2019s on me) and here is some information I did not include in the post because of character limit:\n\n- My pants pocket had a hole in it. The card had slid halfway down the pantsleg, and when I checked the pockets originally I did not see the card. I had tossed them aside to keep looking through my room. \n- I pay rent and car insurance to my mom every month, I also have a job. I live about 20 minutes from my college campus and it was easier to live at home and save up to move out than wasting it all on an apartment next to campus. I plan to move out this upcoming summer after getting my associates. \n- My problem was not with the card being in my possession, I apologized immediately when it was found. I genuinely believed I had returned it and it was an honest mistake. My problem was with my sister invading my space when she did not have permission to do so, and refusing to leave. The conversation was not about her, she was not involved in any way previously to this altercation and chose to insert herself into the situation that was not about her.\n\nIf you guys have any other question, I am responding to as many comments as I can to clarify everything for you. I genuinely just want to know how to move past this, what some good ways to try to implement boundaries would be. I plan on going LC/NC with my family when I move out, but that won\u2019t be for another 6ish months. Thank you again, and I appreciate all of you.", "I as a mother am going to say NTA.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason your mother couldn't have asked you about it calmly and then volunteered to help you look.\n\nThe sister had absolutely NO business being involved.\nI'm sorry your mother has an attitude problem and is basically mean.\n\nHang in there", "Honestly, the second you said your sister came into your room and wouldn't leave... Is it possible she had the card and put it back in your pocket? Just wondering", "Your mother took away your medication and took you out of therapy.

Thank you again, I sincerely appreciate it.", "I appreciate your comment, thank you for your insight - no the card was not planted, it was just a misunderstanding.

You looked high and low for it, but didn't think to look at the most obvious place first and not finding the card.\n\nOf course mom got anxious over possibly losing the card, but really wasn't going about it in a good way either. Last thing any of you need is weird charges on the card.\n\nQuestion: Have your sister and mom ever have you take the blame for something you didn't do? Is it possible the card was planted just to make you think you're crazy even more?", "It doesn't matter because you were wrong the entire time;\n\n>her card was missing and I was the last one who had it. I emptied my wallet to show her it wasn't there, and she asked me to please look for it - I spent hours cleaning my room to find it and I didn't, so I said again that I remember handing it to her when I returned, she asked me to keep looking. This repeated 4 times.\n\nYou were wrong. You were wrong 4x while your mom grew frustrated because she apparently needed the card for something. You caused her a massive load of anxiety because losing a credit card is a bad thing and comes with some incredible stress and frustration.\n\n>This morning (Christmas Eve) | was not feeling my best already because I have been alone (my friends and boyfriend were busy with their families) for the past 2 days, and my mom comes in my room demanding I search again for her card, waking me up and leaving my door wide open when she left. \n\nOk, still you are wrong. Day 2 and still no credit card. She's clearly still upset. You clearly don't care.\n\n>I got up and angrily shut my door (not slammed or anything just closed a little loudly). Amanda took it upon herself to barge into my room and say \"Let me help you look through your stuff to find mom's card.\" I declined many times, knowing it wasn't anywhere I had already looked at 4 times already. \n\nExcept you were wrong. \n\n>She persisted, sitting in my chair and grabbing my bags to go through them. I snatched my stuff away and told her to leave again and she refused.\n\nSo this totally sucks, but she was right, it was in your room in your stuff. \n\n>I know the way I acted here was unacceptable, but I have said multiple times politely already for her to leave and was becoming frustrated. I yelled at her to get out, and my mom came back in yelling at me for \"being uncooperative\".

You don't get to be pissy. If you choose to be pissy you get to eat a LOT of crow for being wrong *and* stressing your mom out and having attitude.\n\n>Eventually, my mom picked up the outfit I wore to the haircut and found her card in my pants pocket, then accused me of stealing and gaslighting her. \n\nFor two days you never double checked the pants? Never gave the hamper a thorough search, including feeling around, shaking things out, etc? You didn't really do even a half assed job looking for the card, and you were dismissive the whole time.\n\n>I genuinely believed I had returned the card, and that was in the part of my room I had not cleaned through yet.\n\nExcept 4x she asked you to keep looking and 4x you didn't even check the hamper portion of your room?\n\n>I apologized, saying I didn't know it was there, and now that it's found can you all please leave me alone. \n\nNope. You need to seriously, majorly apologize for losing the credit card, being dismissive and irritated when they didn't leave you alone about it, causing mom anxiety, and generally expecting them to trust that you've searched you're room week when you clearly didn't. \n\nA simple apology doesn't fix this.\n\n>I did finally get them to leave, and they threw snide remarks at me saying I was overreacting to someone being in my room (uninvited). I was only asking that they didn't disrupt my safe space, and now my door has to stay open and I\u2019m not allowed to leave until my room is clean. All I want is an apology from Amanda - AITA?\n\nSorry, all of this sounds like a reasonable consequence. You think you've been wronged enough to warrant an apology then I think you need to weigh your actions and attitude against how correct your sister was. \n\nIf you don't want people in your safe space then don't hide other people's stuff in your safe space.

Your apology means nothing if your word is shit\n\nEdit to add- you also claimed you gave it back. That was also false.
