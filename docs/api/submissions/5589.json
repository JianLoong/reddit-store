My older sister \"Amanda\" (F25 and my mom (F54) are prone to barging into my room unannounced. I have told them many times to please knock and close the door when they leave and has recently been getting a little better but still not there yet. \n\nI have been struggling with diagnosed depression and severe anxiety and panic attacks. I used to take medication, but my mom took it away last year (different story), as well as taking me out of therapy - I don't have many friends and do not really have a constructive outlet to let my emotions process properly, so usually I have to bottle it up and end up exploding (I know it's not healthy).\n\nBasically, my mom made an appointment for me to get my haircut 3 days ago and gave me her credit card to pay with. When I came home, I remember returning the card and receipt to her and went upstairs. The next day, she said her card was missing and I was the last one who had it. I emptied my wallet to show her it wasn't there, and she asked me to please look for it - I spent hours cleaning my room to find it and I didn't, so I said again that I remember handing it to her when I returned, she asked me to keep looking. This repeated 4 times.\n\nThis morning (Christmas Eve) | was not feeling my best already because I have been alone (my friends and boyfriend were busy with their families) for the past 2 days, and my mom comes in my room demanding I search again for her card, waking me up and leaving my door wide open when she left. I got up and angrily shut my door (not slammed or anything just closed a little loudly). Amanda took it upon herself to barge into my room and say \"Let me help you look through your stuff to find mom's card.\" I declined many times, knowing it wasn't anywhere I had already looked at 4 times already. She persisted, sitting in my chair and grabbing my bags to go through them. I snatched my stuff away and told her to leave again and she refused.\n\nI know the way I acted here was unacceptable, but I have said multiple times politely already for her to leave and was becoming frustrated. I yelled at her to get out, and my mom came back in yelling at me for \"being uncooperative\". I started to cry and scream more - I was just asking to be left alone.\n\nEventually, my mom picked up the outfit I wore to the haircut and found her card in my pants pocket, then accused me of stealing and gaslighting her. I genuinely believed I had returned the card, and that was in the part of my room I had not cleaned through yet. I apologized, saying I didn't know it was there, and now that it's found can you all please leave me alone. \n\nI did finally get them to leave, and they threw snide remarks at me saying I was overreacting to someone being in my room (uninvited). I was only asking that they didn't disrupt my safe space, and now my door has to stay open and I\u2019m not allowed to leave until my room is clean. All I want is an apology from Amanda - AITA?", "created_utc": 1671927818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zumjyl/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_sister_and_mom_after/", "score": 239, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are times a person can be so convinced they\u2019ve done something they haven\u2019t that they believe it\u2019s real. This is a common thing because brains do that.\n\nBut what people usually do when they\u2019re proven wrong is apologize and make amends because no matter how you *feel* because of what you thought, you\u2019re still in the wrong. \n\nInstead you doubled down and tantrummed even though you looked literally everywhere but your own pockets. And it\u2019s a big deal because it\u2019s a credit card. Identity theft, maybe? Major doofus stuff. Own up, say you\u2019re sorry, and learn a lesson here.", "YTA I find it hard to believe that you cleaned your room as thoroughly as you claim if it was then found in your pants pocket in your room.", "YTA. And all your mom was asked is that you take care with her credit card. Her credit card trumps your privacy.", "YTA how can you have looked 4 times but also there was a section of the room that you hadn\u2019t looked through yet which included the clothes you had been wearing when it got lost\u2026. I understand depression is hard and you need to start going to therapy, use your money for that. But your logic doesn\u2019t make sense here", "YTA. You are an adult. You need to act like one. If you don\u2019t like living there, move. You can make your own appointments and handle your own medications. You were wrong about the card, that was your fault. If you genuinely are having a problem remembering things you need to go to the doctor.

I'm not saying you did it purposely or maliciously, but YOU had the card, so you SHOULD be blamed.", "Yes you are the a******.  Your title is misleading because your mom didn't lose her credit card, you left it in your pocket. That's on you. \nSo a couple of things here. Obviously it's a different story but being 19, you shouldn't let your mom control if you go to therapy or the medication that you take, so you should probably fix that ASAP because you're grown and it's your body.\nNumber 2, not sure why your mom didn't have a second or 3rd credit card. Most people have more than one. \n\nNumber 3, how messy is your room.  I know teenagers are overall messy, but you need to really be more organized so you don't have piles of clothes all over the place.\n\nNumber 4 although this is your mom's house but if they're that intrusive, why don't you just get a lock on your door. I would suggest moving out but something tells me that's not feasible for you at the moment.\n You should apologize to your mother about the misunderstanding but then express how you don't like them coming into your room and working on overall communication.. BTW, why does your 25 year old sister live at home still.", "You cleaned four whole times and missed an entire section of your room all four times?? And you didn\u2019t bother to check the pants you were wearing that day? And it was loose in your pockets, not in your wallet? You were disrespectful of your mom\u2019s card at so many points here and you half-assed looking for it. Apologise to your mom and take accountability for the fact that you fucked up here. The tone of your post and your replies has a lot of arrogance here, you don\u2019t really seem sorry for misplacing it.

Give your family a little grace for their understandable panic, and give yourself a little grace in that making a mistake ONLY reflects poorly on you if you don\u2019t take responsibility. If you consistently refuse to take responsibility for mistakes, even if they\u2019re accidental, then unfortunately you would be TA.\n\nI\u2019m so so sorry you\u2019re not able to access the mental health resources you need.

I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re located, but in the US you can call the SAMHSA hotline for help accessing local, confidential, (and sometimes free) mental health resources.

You\u2019ve got some issues you need more work on.", "You need help.  Why did your mother take you out of therapy and stop your medication?", "YTA, obviously. YOU DIDN\u2019T GIVE THE CARD BACK", "You are 19 years old. You are in charge of your mental health. Your mother cannot take your medications from you and refuse you the treatment you need just because she doesn\u2019t want you to have it. This is seriously neglect, but you\u2019re old enough to put your foot down and to stand up to her for this. Make your own appointments and let your health professional know that you do not want them giving information out to her when you sign the privacy notice.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get an apology from them even though you made a genuine mistake. However, I do think you need to start looking into an escape route and moving into your own place.\n\nNTA.", "ESH. \n\nYou: massively overreacted AND were proven wrong. \n\nYour mum: took you off your meds and pulled you out of therapy. I feel like that\u2019s contributing to some of the larger issues you seem to have with control.", "ESH. Neither your mother nor sister would have been bothering you in the first place had you actually given the card back. You thinking you gave the card back means nothing when you actually did not. It\u2019s not your card, it was your responsibility to look for it until you found it. You don\u2019t get to tell someone to leave you alone over something that belongs to them that they want back.", "Sorry, I can't get past the fact that your mother took away your medication?!", "NAH except maybe your sister for insisting on staying until you blew up at her.\n\nYour mom freaking out makes sense and it sounds like you made an honest mistake. Worst case scenario, most card companies take care of any issues and many let you easily lock your card so no one can use it if it gets lost or stolen. So the urgency was there but also wasn't worth it becoming a big issue.\n\nThe lukewarm take of \"it's her house and therefore you don't deserve privacy\" is INSANE to me; if it's your room, your space where all your things are and you spend more time in it than anyone else, of course you deserve privacy and for that to be respected. Sure technically your mom has the right to walk into any room in her own house at any time, but then she'd be an AH for acting like your landlord instead of like your mom. Knocking and announcing before entering is not a big ask.\n\nFinally, on mental illness: Stigma against mental illness unfortunately extends to the way your loved ones treat you. Also, mental illnesses can affect your working memory. Because you thought about returning the card, you created a fake memory for that most likely scenario. Be more careful next time. Don't put something valuable like that in a pants pocket; a wallet or bag pocket is better.\n\nAnd good luck. As another commentor said, you are an adult and your mom can't take your meds away from you.", "NTA.  You might look into getting a lock for your door, or maybe a door wedge to keep them out while you're home.\n\n> I used to take medication, but my mom took it away last year (different story), as well as taking me out of therapy\n\nAs soon as I saw this, I fully expected either your mom or sister to have planted the card in your room.", "I'm in-between YTA and ESH. This is your mom's house right? Do you contribute to live there, work, or go to school? If the answer is no, you have no say in what goes on in that house or who comes into your room (technically your mom's room). However, if you pay any sort of rent (lease agreement or verbal), they are not to enter your room w/o your permission. You did have your mom's card. That's kind of an important detail. I believe that you didn't steal it, however, you did not make a great enough effort to look for it. Then you swore to your mom that you did. This is what makes you TA and not them. Them not respecting your boundaries can make them TA, but this time they had good reason.\n\nEDIT: NTA due to OP paying rent and this being an honest mistake.", "NTA. It was in a pants pocket, it would have been found sooner or later. It sounds like they don't respect your privacy and while I think the situation could have been handled better from every party (which you already acknowledged), you letting out your emotions is not an asshole-worthy behavior in this situation. Memory is failable, and an invasion of personal privacy is enough to set someone over the edge when you're already not doing well as it is.", "Because I have been responding to all comments, I will just make a post that hopefully will get to the top so others see it. Hi I am OP (alternate account on accident, signed in on laptop differently than phone and just started responding that\u2019s on me) and here is some information I did not include in the post because of character limit:\n\n- My pants pocket had a hole in it. The card had slid halfway down the pantsleg, and when I checked the pockets originally I did not see the card. I had tossed them aside to keep looking through my room. \n- I pay rent and car insurance to my mom every month, I also have a job. I live about 20 minutes from my college campus and it was easier to live at home and save up to move out than wasting it all on an apartment next to campus. I plan to move out this upcoming summer after getting my associates. \n- My problem was not with the card being in my possession, I apologized immediately when it was found. I genuinely believed I had returned it and it was an honest mistake. My problem was with my sister invading my space when she did not have permission to do so, and refusing to leave. The conversation was not about her, she was not involved in any way previously to this altercation and chose to insert herself into the situation that was not about her.\n\nIf you guys have any other question, I am responding to as many comments as I can to clarify everything for you. I genuinely just want to know how to move past this, what some good ways to try to implement boundaries would be. I plan on going LC/NC with my family when I move out, but that won\u2019t be for another 6ish months.

What she and her sister are doing to her is abuse. How no one is seeing this is quite amazing.", "Against the grain? ESH\n\nIn this specific situation, you're TA because you insisted upon being obtuse and not helping when someone has lost something that is incredibly important and you were the last one with it. You can't pat something down and say done - you gotta shake that ish out to be certain. \n\nHowever, I too have diagnosed depression and several anxiety disorders. Your mum is an AH in general because she's taken you off of your prescribed medications and pulled you out of therapy - that is incredibly destructive. It's a massive double standard to expect you to be a fully functioning healthy human when she's taken away that which helps you do that. \n\nMy parents struggled when I was first diagnosed cause they didn't wanna have to accept that something was wrong, that it probably happened as I was growing up. It's not an easy thing to face but they also knew not to stand in my way, like your mother has. \n\nYour sister sucks for not being a mediator. If she tried to understand both of you, she could've calmly come to a solution. Instead, she's just helping mum pile on the guilt and giving further ammunition that she's right on taking away your medication and therapy - the idea that \"there's nothing wrong with you, you're just an AH\", which is untrue (of you as a person).", "Is everyone here missing the fact the THE MOM COULD HAVE FOUND IT AND ACTUALLY FRAMED HER AND GAS LIT HER? My ex use to accuse me of losing things he\u2019d lost, would find them and put them in my belongs so he could pretend find them and blame me! I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what happened but if op remembers giving her the card it\u2019s a possibility. The mother has stopped her seeing a therapist and has taken away her medications which is concerning.", "ESH  \nYou should have looked better, but it's an honest mistake, it sometimes happens  \n\n\nYour mother in general shouldn't be so controlling and abusive towards you and they both shouldn't have made remarks. The card is found why making snarky comments?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you can leave them, your mom sounds like a piece of work and I wish you the best\n\nAnd btw for whoever sees this and berated this girl, for real you don't have anything better to do on christmas day than to be an asshole to a person that has a controlling mother and is obviously not on her best mental space\n\nI saw people complaining about this girl because she felt sad bc she is not with her boyfriend or friends, is your life this pathetic that you can't allow people to have emotions?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor all of you who are here berating her, telling her to get a job, telling her to move out or to get in control of her mental health by getting a therapist or her prescriptions, do you really think that it's that easy? You should be ashamed of yourselves for berating a 19 year old who already has a hard life, grow up and stop being an asshole to people", "Hey, no one likes searching for stuff - it sucks! But the thing you have to accept is that you didn\u2019t put in a good faith effort to look for the card. It just doesn\u2019t take multiple days to look through a bedroom. No matter how many excuses you make it\u2019s clear that you did not respect your mother\u2019s concern over her lost credit card, which is a pretty big deal! \n\nThe thing is that boundaries don\u2019t mean \u201cI call the shots and you have to obey me.\u201d Living with other people means navigating and negotiating mutual respect, spaces, anxieties (not just yours - your mom\u2019s about her card too!) etc. Expecting your mom to get access to her money back only on your schedule - she can\u2019t enter, you won\u2019t finish searching - is not a reasonable demand. It shows a great immaturity and lack of respect for her. Of course your mom came in, she needed access to her money and there was no other option at this point.", "Your problem is that you had your mom's credit card and lied about thoroughly checking your room. You are the problem, not your sister. Accept it", "I mean yeah.\n\nI had a similar argument once. The person claimed I did not return the card, and I knew I did. Turns out it they put it in a vest of theirs, that had like six-ten pockets, some double lined... \n\nOn the other hand, while I'm not saying that it's true in OP's case, it does happen someone would sooner gaslight others than acknowledgie that they were wrong, like sliding the card into the pants before \"miraculously\" finding it.", "who asked you", "I mean... is this a troll?\n\nYou paint a pretty solid picture of you being mistreated in your household. Yet the entire actual conflict hinges on you \"remembering giving the card back and looking for it\" then it was found in your pants pocket.\n\nI am not even sure what to say? Is the rest of the post real and this was an honest mistake and trying to see if people will ignore all that over your mistake? Are you exaggerating everything else just like you exaggerated looking multiple times but not finding them in an obvious place? What's going on here?\n\nIF everything is really ESH ??????\n\nYour family sucks for the stated reasons but girl you seriously didn't check your pockets? \n\nI'm not even sure what to do with this", "YTA. I understand that you are struggling but let\u2019s take a step back and look at how this played out. You claimed repeatedly that you had returned your mothers credit card only for it to be found in your pants. Take a second to think how that looks to your mother. It absolutely does come across as you stealing it. Instead of apologising profusely or explaining yourself you decided to throw a fit about people entering your room. Maybe there wouldn\u2019t be a need to do so if you kept it clean and were responsible with other peoples belongings.", "YTA.  You looked everywhere for several days?  You searched 4 times?  And your mom found it in the pants that you were wearing to get your haircut?  \n\nDude, I agree with your mom on this one.  You obviously did not look everywhere.", "YTA, they were correct - you had lost it, it was in your room, and they found it in your room after you tried looking, meaning their actions were justified here (especially with how important credit cards are) and you blew up unfairly. \n\nThey certainly sound independently awful for other reasons, that second paragraph as an independent story would make your mother TA hands down, and it probably contributed to the issues here, but as you said, that's not what's being discussed here.", "ESH You should have let her search. She needed the card. Accusing you of gaslighting and stealing is insane though.", "YTA. You fucked up. How do you remember giving your mom the card and receipt when you didn't? You thoroughly cleaned yet didn't have common sense to check the pants you were wearing? Also you are 19 so mommy can't withhold your medicine or stop you from going to therapy or moving out for that matter. You are an adult act like it. You created this mess and think an oops my bad should be suffice and keep flipping it to they're invading my privacy, they're mean woe is me blah blah blah. It sounds like you need someone to help you be an adult if you're saying you did things you did then couldn't find something in your pocket. With that being said they do not belong barging in your room whenever they want but I also feel you're causing your problems.", "YTA. From what I read you are really trying to paint your mom and sister to be awful but it feels like certain details are being left out so you can have a bit more control of the narrative. That being said you sound like you have an excuse for everything and don't like to be held accountable for any of this. Also why is your title indicating that your sister or moms lost the credit card and then only blamed you. It was 100% you that lost it. They blamed you because it was you. It wasn't them. You want to avoid this in the future then don't borrow other people bank cards and keep track of your shit.", "I\u2019m so confused by your title. You lost the credit card, not sister or mom as you implied in title. You aren\u2019t \u201cblamed\u201d if you\u2019re the one who did it. YTA", "I find it curious that your sister wanted to help and after you kept saying no, she was insisting on helping still. Could she have nabbed it and decided to hide it in your room because she didn\u2019t want to be caught?", "YTA, YOU LOST THE CREDIT CARD. ALL YOUR FAULT.", "Yta, she didn\u2019t lose her card, you misplaced it and then blew up at them. Just apologize and talk to her about the therapy and medication.", "If you live in the US then you are a legal adult but more importantly...perhaps it's time you start taking more adult responsibility.  You did in fact have the card and a room shouldn't be so messy as to take days to go through.\n\nMore importantly, however, how is it that Mom won't let you see a therapist and/or take anti-anxiety meds?  Also, as an adult...why are you letting her?  The whole door open, clean room, etc is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous, again...why are you letting her treat you this way?\n\nPoint being...you need to develop and execute an exit strategy.  Live on your own, get your own healthcare, and take adult ownership of your own life.", "NTA \n     I'm so sorry that your mom took you off your meds and out of therapy. I can understand how MENTAL ILLNESS  is making it hard for you to remember what you did with the card. Instead of offering to help in the beginning because depression room mess sucks cleaning up, they yelled and made everything overwhelming. I really hope you get the help you need.", "The credit card is the red herring in this cry for help story. \n\nYou need your meds and you sound like therapy is a good call to help you cope with your struggles. Taking someone's meds is serious business.\n\nare you being treated well OP or are you being abused for your mental health issues? \n\nis there anyone else you can stay with? Please speak to someone, a helpline, your doctor, etc.", "I\u2019m undecided because withholding prescribed medicine puts the mother in such a bad position to me. Combined with the lack of privacy, I\u2019m inclined to believe that the mother or the sister secretly put the card back in the pocket. Pure speculation of course.\n\nBut realistically, one of the signs of depression is forgetfulness and it is the mother\u2019s fault that OP\u2019s depression is untreated, so, NTA from me.", "I'm  more concerned about the abuse Op is going through with her mother. Yeah she should've looked for the card again and she's a soft AH for that. But ffs, her mother is illegally withholding legally prescribed scripts from her, withdrew her from her therapy, is downright cruel to her along with her sister. They know she's mentally ill yet they're abusing her. How the hell is no one talking about this and are piling on about the CC?\n\nSome people are being pretty nasty over what was an error on her part. Yet are completely blind to the horror show that is her life with her mother. I come from an abusive family dynamic. This will fuck her up for life unless she's allowed to continue with therapy and have her script. The cruelty that people seem to be ignoring is horrific. They're suffocating her. She will be a shell of a human being by the time she leaves if they don't stop with this abuse.", "I agree with ESH but you the most honestly. Of course it is super frustrating to feel you\u2019re right about something and everyone tell you you\u2019re wrong and overreacting. But just from my experience, I used to act like you when I was a teenager. And a big part was being unmedicated, but mostly it was due to not knowing how to process my emotions. I think you\u2019re young and having a hard time living that in between phases of teenager/adult.\n\nYou\u2019re not behaving out of the ordinary. But try to remember your mom and sister are older and have different insights than you. Just try to not take things too seriously. That\u2019s the advice I would give to my younger self.", "Yep..", "Thank you!! She was wrong in this situation but kept bringing up her family's actions. Makes zero sense here.", "I agree with everything you said except the last sentence\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with a 25-year old living at home? Are you not aware of the insane cost of living in basically ever city/country on this planet? I\u2019m 25 and I live at home. As of march 2022, nearly 1/3 Americans age 25-29 live with their parents. It\u2019s mind-boggling that anyone could talk down about a mid-20s child living with their parents in this economy. It makes you sound quite out of touch", "Why are you replying using a different account?", "Agreed. I came back today to change my vote to ESH.", "OP, it\u2019s a red flag that your mom is filling your prescription and not allowing you to take it as prescribed. Why aren\u2019t you picking up your own medication? If you\u2019re not able to access this med at all, call the prescribing physician and cancel the script. Why do you think your mom is withholding your meds??", " Don't think the sentence was talking down, was curious is all. I understand the cost the living is high but most people want to strike out on their own.  I have a kid who's in her early twenties and she moved out on her own at 19 and is taking care of all her bills while working and taking college classes.  She knows she could've stay at home for a few more years and it always welcome to come back if things get rough but she wanted to get on her own and be independent, which I totally respect. I did the same thing when I was her age.", "I don\u2019t get how \u201emistakenly still having the card\u201c gives her SISTER the right invade her privacy?\nBarging in, Refusing to leave the room, going through the purse..\n\nIMHO NTA", "I\u2019ve been waiting for someone to point this out. Also, doesn\u2019t OP state she hadn\u2019t checked the pants yet when her mom picked them up?", "YTA. You clearly didn\u2019t look very hard if the card was in your pocket. Not only that, but you threw a tantrum over it. \n\nYou have a lot of growing up to do.", "You should\u2026fix that."]}
