Yes it may have been harsh but you literally said the same thing back to her.", "ESH. She said it first and you bit back. Maybe tell her why you said what you did, so she knows she hurt you too and will think twice in future. Body shaming always sucks.", "NTA. She can't actually believe she is justified in being angry for you saying something to her that she literally had just said to you.", "I mean, it's not like you said it to be nasty to her. You said it as a response due to your feelings hurt (rightfully so as well).\n\nThe next step would be to tell her your reasoning in saying it, so she knows she hurt your feelings with her nasty comment.\n\nShe should love you for the way you are and not try to change you! \n\nNTA", "NTA-Respect is a two way street. Women want equality, but then pull different cards to get out of being treated equally. I am a woman with a thyroid issue and had 3 kids. Yes I gained some weight naturally, but there were also lifestyle changes I had to make to lose that weight. That being said, she shouldn\u2019t have compared her husband to another man whose body is attractive because he worked out for a movie if she doesn\u2019t herself workout or make lifestyle changes to not have a bikini body. And even if she did it\u2019s still mean to attack your spouse about the way they look.", "Haha, NTA. She pretty much started this, and has no ground to be mad at you. If I said something that stupid to my partner I would expect him to throw the same nonsense right back at me.", "NTA. She went there first, and by the sounds of things, she has zero room to talk. Zero. Having a dead thyroid (Hey, me too! Also popped out spawns, and I am not overweight!) doesn\u2019t make what you said any worse. She started some sh\\*t. She didn\u2019t like the result. Y\u2019all play nice, because two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, but I\u2019d probably be hurt, too. I would probably clap back.", "NTA\u2026 me-married, mother with hypothyroidism who\u2019s weight fluctuates dramatically but I\u2019m not self conscious, so it\u2019s whatever but anyways\u2026. Why is it ok for wife to act like she said nothing wrong but she can get mad?  What\u2019s good for the geese is good for the gander. Stop making excuses for her behavior. I\u2019m curious if wife has made comments before and OP is just fed up? Asking because I have a friend who does this to her hubby, even in group situations and my hubby and I are embarrassed for him. He NEVER comments about her weight and only compliments her. The ironic thing is that he has been steadily losing weight and she is gaining and I don\u2019t think she notices because she still barks at him and she is honestly embarrassing herself at this point! The double standard just pisses me off!", "ESH.  Both of you were unkind.  She\u2019s worse for starting it, though.", "NTA\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have said what she said because she started something that she couldn\u2019t handle. I always say and I stand by this do not say something to somebody. If you know you can\u2019t handle what they will say back to you.", "NTA\n\nIt makes me sad that people act like men don't have feelings, and that getting compliments and insults affects them just as much as it affects women.", "NTA - She pulled the pin and didn't like the kaboom.", "Nta. But be a good husband and apologize. I\u2019ve had this exact scenario with my wife. Except it was Wanderlust. And no prior medical condition.  Apologize and move on is what I did.", "NTA. Don\u2019t shit on somebody else if you don\u2019t wNt to get shit on in return. People like your wife who can dish it out but can\u2019t take it annoy the living hell out of me.", "NTA at all\n\nShe set herself up for that comment. She shouldn't body shame you if she doesn't wanna be shamed back.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t make that type of joke if it would hurt her to have it made about her but she\u2019s probably extra sensitive about her weight gain with the medical issues and kids and you probably should have known better than to respond to hurt with hurting in turn instead of saying the comment hurt you.", "NTA. Those in glass houses shouldn't be throwing stones.", "ESH\n\nIs this a UNO reverse situation?  \n\nI don't know, but it is a \"if you dish it out you better eat it\" situation.  \n\nIt was a rude comment from both sides.", "ESH It was probably hurtful to both of you. Next time I would say \u201cthat hurt my feelings,\u201d instead of retaliating. My husband and I will watch movies and shows and we both think it\u2019s fun and funny to say, \u201cwoah, babe alert!\u201d about anyone we think is hot regardless of gender. We don\u2019t point out specifics, beyond that, we usually will agree they are an attractive human. We don\u2019t bring each other into it in comparison and we make sure to compliment each other often. I know the babe alert thing isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but it\u2019s just an example of how you can appreciate beauty in a lighthearted way without needing to compare to your partner.", "NTA - If you can't take it, don't dish it.", "Nta. People say that \"an eye for an eye makes the world go blind\" but if you don't return the same negative treatment that you receive, people will continue to be able to justify shitty behaviour. Once you treat them the same way they do to you, they will understand fault in their actions, and if they don't, they will understand that acting shitty will have consequences.", "NTA. Fairs fair.", "NTA. Don\u2019t say things to people what would upset you if they responded in-kind. She FAFO. She\u2019s the worst kind of hypocrite IMO.", "NTA she can give it but can't take it. Hate hypocrisy.", "NTA. Don\u2019t dish it if you can\u2019t take it.", "NTA\n\nIf she didn't want to be mad, she shouldn't have criticized your body.

If she can\u2019t take it, then she shouldn\u2019t dish it!", "ESH, and I\u2019m surprised more people aren\u2019t saying that. She should never have said something so hurtful and mean to you but any adult\u2014especially one in a marriage\u2014should know that just repeating back a hurtful sentiment is immature. That doesn\u2019t helpful anyone. You sit down and explain what felt wrong and ask for an apology. \n\nBut honestly it seems like you already do know all of that. If you two really care for one another you can work this out easily with a conversation. Good luck.", "ESH. Her joke wasn't funny and your response was mean.", "ESH. She started it, but knowing how it made you feel, you turned it around on her. Maybe it would have been better to just acknowledge that you were offended instead of body shaming the mother of your children. From now on, if you say that her weight doesn't bother you, she'll remember this one comment instead.", "ESH", "ESH but you can't really call her out for having kids ruining her bod when you were the one that knocked her up.", "ESH. Body shaming, even passively like this, is never cool", "You are asking the wrong question. Do you think it is important to figure out who is right in the argument? I don't see that as winning. \n\nSoft ESH", "ESH\n\nShitty comments from both sides", "ESH. Her comment to you was unkind, but so was yours especially since you know it's a source of insecurity for her.", "YTA. She shouldn\u2019t have said that. However she has been the one having major things go on in her body that have left it permanently changed in ways she could not control or fix, and which she clearly feels self-conscious about. It was a totally different level of insult when it was aimed at her.", "YTA. Did you have three kids and have your thyroid killed with radiation? Instead you should have gotten up and left, let her know she can't hurt you like this. I'm going with YTA instead of ESH because she HAS reasons for being unfit and laziness isn't one of them because according to you she's this way despite trying to lose weight. She was an AH but you knocked it out of the park.", "YTA. It was way different for her to say it to you when your body hasn\u2019t changed over the years but hers has because of carrying your children and an illness. You know you stepped a line. It was very passive aggressive. If she hurt your feelings you should have told her so instead of saying something you knew would hurt her so much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like if it's a nosy stranger or a customer at work being rude to me, I'm quite happy to be rude back.\n\nBut it was the OP's wife and they're meant to care about each other.
