Wife starts shit and OP has to back down. It's abusive.", "I just don\u2019t have tolerance for assholes who think they can say and do shit to hurt people and not expect to get a taste of their own medicine. I don\u2019t care about being the bigger person around assholes, i\u2019ll stoop to your level, matter of fact i can stoop even lower. Idc. I\u2019ll sleep good each night regardless. \n\nI\u2019m not out there being a dick to people, when done to me i don\u2019t agree with it. If it makes me immature so be it, i couldn\u2019t care. I\u2019m not letting these kind of people walk all over me with no repercussions.", "I agree that couples can say things that inadvertently hurt their partners feelings. Your example being a prime case of accidental injury. \n\nBut you have to be stupid to not realize that unfavorably comparing your partners body to a movie star would be hurtful. She owes him a huge apology", "I definitely agree that we all make little slips, but if I say something and am immediately offended when it is repeated to me almost verbatim, surely I knew it was a bad thing to say from the outset, rather than something that wasn\u2019t taken the way I expected. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s some unconscious bias here because of how society scrutinises women\u2019s bodies day to day. Not saying it\u2019s bad to factor that in, I think it\u2019s very valid. \n\nI\u2019m just struggling to buy the simple \u201ctwo wrongs don\u2019t make a right\u201d argument on a sub where a majority of the posts (incl. NTA ones) revolve around some for of retaliation.", "This. Traditionalists say that men shouldn't complain about being criticized and if you don't want to have people call you fat you just have to lose weight. So, since men aren't allowed to complain, feminists say that men aren't judged for their appearance so there's no reason to feel offended.", "Better than the usual Reddit \"dump them immediately\" advice...", "And?", "Not really. Also, a lot of this is basically \"How dare you mess with your wife?!\". If they're equal partners, she shouldn't be upset when she's treated the way she treated him. I'm a woman.", "Right?  My SO and I laugh at this sub.  If I wasn't engaged already and read this sub, I'd refuse to get married.", "Slightly the asshole makes more sense than slightly not the asshole.", "It's difficult, but possible, if you don't have the worst forms of it.\nLike i previously stated, my relative tried anything. He was very active, ate really well and still couldn't make it. We're talking about a span of (at least) 15 years, not some months.\nHe went to a lot of doctors, really a lot and everyone agreed that yes, he could get the situation under control but it would be pretty much impossible to lose that much weight and live a normal life.\n\nWhile i'm not excluding that some of these people can do it, maybe, unfortunately it's not the case for others of them.\nThe thyroid is a beast to control.\n\nEdit: yeah of course, i only used Hemsworth as an example of what a lot of men and women picture as a man with a shaped and good looking body.", "The people disagreeing are just defying the fundamental laws of physics; because getting fat without the required calorific intake requires the creation of energy.. except, the inability to create or destroy energy is literally Physics 101. \n\nYour thyroid problem might mean you can eat less and gain more; but it\u2019s because the gap between consumption in/out is more unforgiving. She\u2019s not going to be gaining weight if she\u2019s on the 1200 calorie salad-based diets of movie stars, especially if coupled with 8 hours of strenuous exercise per day and routine dehydration to cut down water weigh.\n\nIt\u2019s science, not feeling.", "The mods have repeatedly said to use NTA when it's a justified asshole. Not sure why they just don't put that on the sidebar when it keeps coming up like this.", "No I'd still think they're both assholes. Insulting someone is an asshole move. Reversing their genders wouldn't change that, only dumb sexists would think so.", "100% agree.  She definitely owes him an apology.  That was hurtful and, at absolute best, stupid.  But the right way to respond wasn't to inflict the same harm.  The right way to respond was to let her know.  \n\nI don't think I'd be making this argument if they were friends or coworkers, btw.  But they are a married couple. And, again, this just didn't yield a favorable outcome for anyone - I imagine what the OP really wanted was for his wife to understand the hurt she caused, apologize and mean it.  This argument is going to take longer (even if everyone does everything right) to yield that result.", "And some people lack empathy. Explaining your feelings doesn\u2019t always work and can be met with \u201cit was just a joke\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re too sensitive \u201c. Turning the tables like he did was a way to show her first hand how it felt to have that sort of comment directed at them.", "Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell. My brother is the kind of person that is always trying to be funny and sarcastic. He loves funny shirts, but got a little offended when I showed him one with a rhino that said, \u201csave the chubby unicorns\u201d. I never made any comment about the shirt being for him, and we were just showing shirts to one another.", "I agree! Health issues might make your desire for food, or effect the way you body processes food, but it is still no excuse for eating too much. If you have a slow metabolism, eat less! \n\nWhen I was thirty years old I ate roughly 4,000 calories a day and weighed 165 pounds. i had a very strenuous job. I could pretty much eat everything in front of me and burn it off. I am over 60 years old and exist on a somewhere between 1,000-1,500 calories a day. If I ate like I did at 30 I would weigh 500 pounds. I adjusted my calorie intake over the years to fit my activity and metabolism level.", "\"The mods have repeatedly said they won't give the people what they want\".\n\nThe mods are wrong. NTA is not correct for a justified asshole.", "Laughable", "I agree. It could be JAH.", "You can hold out and get caught up in the unfairness of life or you can recognize that sexism is still a thing we have to overcome gradually. This is one of the ways it negatively impacts men and it needs to change, but saying this man isn't an asshole purely on the account that if he was a woman and his wife was his husband screams bitterness.", "Then you knew shitty people.  That doesn't mean you have to hate all women.  It means you need to go to therapy or journal, read some books, find your own inner well of self-worth and expend that energy on a curated group of people who are kind and good to you.  \n\nIt doesn't mean that you, or everyone in the world, should walk around with a gigantic chip on their shoulder assuming all the motivations of those around you are bad or that they cannot self-correct once they realize - this is obviously even more important in this case as they are a married couple.  \n\nThere is no alternative first step besides having a conversation.", "Im not saying hes not an asshole solely because of that, are you dense? If the roles were reversed my judgement would be the same.", ">That doesn't mean you have to hate all women.\n\nSorry no, I respond in kind to everybody mocks me: man, woman and everything in between.\n\nAnd no, I don' t know only shitty people. I know every kind of people and sadly even good people usually don' t understand how a man can feel offended by jokes about his appearence because \"Everybody knows that men are not judged by their appearence.\" and the best thing you can have is an half hearted apology.", ">>I don\u2019t think he\u2019s an asshole. Im sure if the genders were reversed people would cheer her on. She could have said nothing at all, he literally said the same thing she did and she got upset. Ridiculous.\n\nAre you dense because you literally did?"]}
