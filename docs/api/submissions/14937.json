They were coming to my city, so I decided to book a ticket.\n\n  \n I sent my bf (29M)  a link to the bands spotify page telling him I was going and and asking if he would like to come. In the message I explicitly stated that I was happy to go alone( he knows I go to many concerts alone). I was not asking him to accompany me. He replied straight away saying he might as well, so I knew he hadn't had time to listen to the bands music yet, but I just though he was coming for the vibes. I bought 2 tickets at 25\u20ac and I didn't charge him btw.  \n\n\nThe day of the concert we agree to meet for a drink at 7pm. The concert started at 8pm, the band and venue were small, so I was sure they would start on time, without any support acts. Another thing for context; I had a really heavy camping bag with me due to a miscommunication between 2 friends, don't have the word count to get into it.  \nAt 7pm I haven't heard back from my BF about a meeting place and have tried calling him multiple times, at 7.40 I get a message from him saying he fell asleep and he is going to get a taxi. Unfortunately, the city centre had a lot of redirects of traffic that night so he was still 2 miles away at 7.55.   \n\n\nHere is where I might be the AH, at 7.55 I sent him his ticket and told him I would meet him in the venue. I knew from his response that this upset him but I had wanted to see this band for over 4 years so didn't want to miss anything.  \n\n\nOnce in the venue I found a good spot, put the massive camping bag down and tried to send my bf a text with my location, only to find there was no signal. I couldn't look for him in the dense crowd with the camping bag, so I hoped he would find me. He did during the last song but it was clear he was pissed. I asked him what was wrong and he asked me if I even tried to look for him inside, which I honestly answered no. He got super mad and started saying that he only came to the concert for me, that I made no effort to show him the music beforehand and that I had ruined his evening.   \n\n\nI tried telling him that I thought it was just unlucky circumstances, but he kept saying that he only went to the concert for me and I had ruined his night by not waiting for him when he was going out of his way for me.\n\nI went back to our messages and read aloud our conversation, which said no pressure to come, a link to their spotify page and the time and date to the concert cause I was annoyed at how untrue his accusations were. He didn't acknowledge anything I said and instead said that I just wanted to win the argument. I feel beyond frustrated as I literally don't see what I could have done in this situation other than miss the concert, which I don't feel is a fair expectation from him. Also if the situation had been in reverse and I was about to delay my bf from entering a concert that I knew he had wanted to see for over 4 years, I would have told them to send me the ticket and go enjoy himself.  \n\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1681645889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12o5ytb/aita_for_going_into_a_concert_without_my_bf_after/", "score": 1352, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He had the relevant information he should have set alarms on his phone if he was feeling sleepy in the event he fell asleep.

I\u2019m still going, I\u2019m not gonna stop stop watching the set to track them down, and I\u2019m certainly not going to apologize for paying attention to the set instead of paying attention to the person who disrespected my time and interest. Live music is one of my passions. Every show in my opinion is a once in a lifetime event. If other people don\u2019t care as much then they\u2019re obvi not going to get it but don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad for having passion", "NTA- he didn\u2019t have to even come", "I had to check the ages.

He\u2019s 29, he should\u2019ve set an alarm and been an adult if he really wanted to attend the full concert with you.", "NTA but you guys seem to have a communication issue. I can\u2019t shake the feeling he isn\u2019t so much out to win the argument but more so upset that his effort isn\u2019t being seen or appreciated. Although it\u2019s not your fault, if you want to build your relationship you should validate how much you appreciate how hard he worked on getting there, and how much appreciate him putting in so much effort to come to a concert just for you. I guess that\u2019s were his upset feelings mostly come from. He feels he put in all this effort and he did it for you but it wasn\u2019t reciprocated. From his point of view you are the asshole. I\u2019ve learned that in marriage. It doesn\u2019t matter that you cook all the time. If your husband brings out the trash without reminder, cooks supper or cleans the house - a simple thank you will make his day.", "NTA. He's gaslighting you. If it was important to him, he would've set an alarm and been there on time. As far as not making an effort to share their music with him, I frequently invite friends to concerts with me. If they ask, I'll send them a spotify link or the name of my favorite album, but otherwise, it's on them. Some just show up and enjoy the vibes, others listen to the music in advance.", "NTA, your bf is gaslighting you out of embarrassment that he overslept. He should grow up. Hope you enjoyed your gig.", "NTA but I guess I don\u2019t really understand why you are dating lol. You \u201cdon\u2019t care if he comes with you\u201d and he didn\u2019t seem to care that you asked him if he\u2019d want to come spend time with you. \n\nAlso I\u2019m dying to know how you ended up having to haul a camping backpack INTO a concert \ud83d\ude02", "ESH. He fell asleep and was late, but overall he still made an effort to be with you at an event that was important to you in order to share something with you. Instead, he spent the whole concert looking for you in a crowded venue. You could have a made a tiny bit of effort to connect with him once you knew he was at the place. Yes, you didn't make him go, but it's deeply discourteous of you to hope he found you once you were inside without trying. Could you have spent a tiny bit of time looking for him? Surely you could have still heard the concert whilst looking for him.", "ESH but take it with a grain of salt because I don't like live music that much, but you really should have looked for him inside or tried to find a way to be able to text him. Asks someone to watch the bag, check it, carry it. \n\nI'm not saying you two are incompatible over one situation, but neither of you can see the other's point right now. He gets it, you told him you only care about the concert, you love the band, he can come or not, it literally makes no difference to you as long as you get the see the concert, he's irrelevant. He seems like he understood how much you love the band and wanted to share that with you, but having him to share this with wasn't important to you. \n\nHe overslept and was late - that's super rude and an AH move. I'm always early, but I do not ascribe to the believe that if someone is late they don't respect you, life happens. To preface this I know everyone already disagrees with me, but if I were you I'd have either tried to find him and missed a song or two in the beginning, or apologized profusely after and said with the perfect storm of the bag, no signal and him being late you got too into the music and you're sorry. And he apologies for napping and you two work on better communication in the future.\n\nYou both just want to be right.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Otherwise, all he was doing was making you miss out.\n\nI'll give him the benefit of the doubt that I assume he's just frustrated that he rushed to come, missed the whole thing, and had to spend the whole time looking for someone.

It's a complex and frankly **very broad** (i.e., *not* \"very specific\") term that encompasses a wide range of manipulative behaviors and tactics in order to accomplish the effect of making someone doubt themselves and their own perceptions. Someone who lies and DARVOs *consistently*, for instance, *can* accurately be labelled a gaslighter, since they're regularly trying to convince other people that their perceptions/memories/feelings are inaccurate or straight-up false. \n\nOP *is* being gaslit here.

This wasn't about \"winning\" the argument, its about you defending from delusion.", "It's both hilarious and infuriating to me how it's always the people who have *zero* actual concept of what \"gaslighting\" entails/looks like beyond that one movie from 1944 that whine about how overused the term is. \n\nGaslighting is a pattern of behaviors instigated by one person to make the other doubt and/or second-guess their own senses, perceptions, feelings, and/or memories. The term encompasses many other manipulative tactics such as DARVO, triangulation, projection, love bombing, etc, because all of these tactics can be used towards gaslighting someone. What differentiates \"gaslighting\" from those other manipulation tactics, or just lying and passive-aggression, is the *pattern* component. You don't just get gaslit once or twice, it happens consistently over a period of time. It's a complex and frankly **very broad** term that encompasses a wide range of manipulative behaviors and tactics in order to accomplish the effect of making someone doubt themselves and their own perceptions. Someone who lies and DARVOs *consistently*, for instance, can accurately be labelled a gaslighter, since they're regularly trying to convince other people that their perceptions/memories/feelings are inaccurate or straight-up false. \n\nOP *is* being gaslit here. Not only is there a pattern of similar prior behavior, but their bf is actively trying to convince them that **things did not actually happen the way that they objectively happened**. He is deliberately making them doubt their memories, feelings, and lived experiences regarding this entire event. That, in addition to OP's adding that the bf has a history of this kind of behavior, is *literally* textbook gaslighting.", "NTA. You made your intentions known from the jump and communicated with him every step of the way. You only ruined his evening by having the audacity to enjoy your night on your own instead of waiting for him to grace you with his presence.", "NTA but you deserve a better bf. This concert was important to you & he agreed to go. Then he showed you how little he cared. Listen to his actions!", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown adult. He knows how to read time. If he can\u2019t be on time, that\u2019s on him not you.", "Nta. Also what band was it?", "NTA. He sounds like he's not very pleasant to you. He made absolutely no effort and then blamed you when that bit him in the ass.", "nta. you said yourself the venue was small. i\u2019ve gone to plenty of concerts at my local venue and just found my friends when they got there, it never takes THAT long. with that said, probably would\u2019ve been helpful to have given a. general idea of where you were headed, if there\u2019s different levels for example, so he could have a general idea of where to look for you when you arrived", "NTA.\n\nOP, don't invite him to anything else you've your heart on enjoying. He's the AH throwing everything but an apology your way.", "Personally I would have waited in a noticeable location or in the back for my partner, but I guess NTA.", "Glad to know I\u2019m not the only one that thinks she deserves a better bf!", "NTA, you are very low on his priority list. Leave now before it gets worse", "NTA. It's his fault for not being better prepared. He just wanted an excuse to bitch at you, and something tells me this probably isn't the first time that he's blamed you for something that was his fault. At 29, he should be responsible enough to get himself somewhere on time.", "NTA but lacking consideration. He was angry that you, by all appearances, left him high and dry. He may have only come out there as a favor to you and probably felt some concern for your safety. You wouldn't inconvenience yourself for even a moment to check the lobby area; justifying it in your post by saying that your bag was big. I would say that YTA if not for the impression I get that your selfishness isn't mean-spirited but is the product of immaturity. There's probably a major lack of communication in your relationship and that your man gets annoyed with you far more than you realize; his fault for not speaking up.", "NTA. His irresponsibility is not your problem, you gave him every possible bit of information he needed, all he had to do was show up on time and he us clearly incapable of even doing that. Take it from someone who dated a man like this for way too long, he is showing you who he is and it will not change no matter how much energy you put into trying to inspire him to change. It will likely get worse the longer you know him. \n\nSomething was important to you, he couldn't even do the bare minimum and show up in time, then when he did get there he essentially ruined the last part of the concert for you, then he tried to blame his own lack of adult behaviour on you. Does that sound like something you want to tolerate long term?", "Nta. I'm going to a concert in June. Told partner that I'm going with or without him. He is happy to come but doesn't care if I go alone. \n\nYour bf is an AH", "I like how he argues, clearly loses and then says arguing is wrong.\nHe\u2019s lazy, can\u2019t set an alarm, can\u2019t read a clock, can\u2019t use Google/Spotify/YouTube\u2026 he can\u2019t be honest either. WTF are you looking for? \nNTA at all, you communicated clearly, often and were fair in everything. \nWhen he pulls his head out of his ass make sure to disinfect thoroughly. Be prepared it might be a permanent exhibit even though I\u2019m sure he has lots of other good traits.", "My bet would be not. Adults keeping prior arrangement don\u2019t need to be praised like toddlers using a pot.", "This situation was definitely him gaslighting you. He ruined his own night by falling asleep, if it was something he thought was important he wouldn't have fallen asleep. You're NTA, I hope his bullshit didn't ruin the concert for you", "If he is gaslighting you, you need to have a serious talk when everyone is calm. If he continues you need to leave,  will get worse, my girl.", "If you're seeing a pattern? Dump him now. Do not pass go. I'd have probably brushed this off as a one time childish thing, everyone has the occasional bad day where they know they're in the wrong but need time to come around to the fact that they're an ass, but it would have been a black mark in his column. \n\nBut if this sort of behavior is a pattern? He's not worth your time and the stress he will cause. Cut him lose.", "She said he frequently behaves like this, but, frankly, lavishing praise on someone (and i\u2019ll bet it\u2019s always a man) who fucks up an arrangement,  does the bare minimum to mend this, takes offence at their supposed companion daring to attend the timed event without them and throws a massive, gaslighting tanty - why are your expectations so low that you\u2019re looking for ways to praise this shitshow? \n\nTry expecting more for yourself, and OP, if you see this, you\u2019re not wrong, your bf is awful.", "NTA. Your bf sounds exhausting. He ruined the night for the both of you and can\u2019t even own up to it. It\u2019s a big red flag when someone can\u2019t admit their own mistakes, and it\u2019s even worse when they blame others for them. He knew seeing this band meant a lot to you and still wanted you to potentially miss the show to accommodate him. What a selfish AH.", "We all know who the asshole is (NTA). Just wanted to say that you are awesome for going to concerts solo. I do the same and it\u2019s liberating not having to babysit someone and hope they like your music. You get to enjoy every song!", "> because I don't like live music that much\n\nSo you don't realise:\n\n* Some venues are simply dead zones for mobile signal. There's a few I go to often that you essentially need to go back outside in order to be able to get anything.\n* How busy / crowded gigs can be and how difficult that would make it to get outside to get signal and then to get back to where OP was in the crowd.", "That\u2019s why I said take it with a grain of salt. I thought it\u2019d be ok to share my point of view as someone who doesn\u2019t care for live music. Maybe it could offer some insight into the bf etc. I now realize my point of view was not welcome and I am sorry. You\u2019re totally right. I didn\u2019t realize any of that and should not have commented. I didn\u2019t mean to offend. Truly.", "lmfao op is not the problem", "It can be over applied... but this is kinda a clear example of creating a false narrative where she failed him, rather than the reverse.", "OP literally said she\u2019s felt like he\u2019s been gaslighting her recently though.."]}
