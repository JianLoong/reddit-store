They were coming to my city, so I decided to book a ticket.\n\n  \n I sent my bf (29M)  a link to the bands spotify page telling him I was going and and asking if he would like to come. In the message I explicitly stated that I was happy to go alone( he knows I go to many concerts alone). I was not asking him to accompany me. He replied straight away saying he might as well, so I knew he hadn't had time to listen to the bands music yet, but I just though he was coming for the vibes. I bought 2 tickets at 25\u20ac and I didn't charge him btw.  \n\n\nThe day of the concert we agree to meet for a drink at 7pm. The concert started at 8pm, the band and venue were small, so I was sure they would start on time, without any support acts. Another thing for context; I had a really heavy camping bag with me due to a miscommunication between 2 friends, don't have the word count to get into it.  \nAt 7pm I haven't heard back from my BF about a meeting place and have tried calling him multiple times, at 7.40 I get a message from him saying he fell asleep and he is going to get a taxi. Unfortunately, the city centre had a lot of redirects of traffic that night so he was still 2 miles away at 7.55.   \n\n\nHere is where I might be the AH, at 7.55 I sent him his ticket and told him I would meet him in the venue. I knew from his response that this upset him but I had wanted to see this band for over 4 years so didn't want to miss anything.  \n\n\nOnce in the venue I found a good spot, put the massive camping bag down and tried to send my bf a text with my location, only to find there was no signal. I couldn't look for him in the dense crowd with the camping bag, so I hoped he would find me. He did during the last song but it was clear he was pissed. I asked him what was wrong and he asked me if I even tried to look for him inside, which I honestly answered no. He got super mad and started saying that he only came to the concert for me, that I made no effort to show him the music beforehand and that I had ruined his evening.   \n\n\nI tried telling him that I thought it was just unlucky circumstances, but he kept saying that he only went to the concert for me and I had ruined his night by not waiting for him when he was going out of his way for me.\n\nI went back to our messages and read aloud our conversation, which said no pressure to come, a link to their spotify page and the time and date to the concert cause I was annoyed at how untrue his accusations were. He didn't acknowledge anything I said and instead said that I just wanted to win the argument. I feel beyond frustrated as I literally don't see what I could have done in this situation other than miss the concert, which I don't feel is a fair expectation from him. Also if the situation had been in reverse and I was about to delay my bf from entering a concert that I knew he had wanted to see for over 4 years, I would have told them to send me the ticket and go enjoy himself.  \n\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1681645889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12o5ytb/aita_for_going_into_a_concert_without_my_bf_after/", "score": 495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He had the relevant information he should have set alarms on his phone if he was feeling sleepy in the event he fell asleep.

I\u2019m still going, I\u2019m not gonna stop stop watching the set to track them down, and I\u2019m certainly not going to apologize for paying attention to the set instead of paying attention to the person who disrespected my time and interest. Live music is one of my passions. Every show in my opinion is a once in a lifetime event. If other people don\u2019t care as much then they\u2019re obvi not going to get it but don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad for having passion", "NTA- he didn\u2019t have to even come", "I had to check the ages.

He\u2019s 29, he should\u2019ve set an alarm and been an adult if he really wanted to attend the full concert with you.", "NTA but you guys seem to have a communication issue. I can\u2019t shake the feeling he isn\u2019t so much out to win the argument but more so upset that his effort isn\u2019t being seen or appreciated. Although it\u2019s not your fault, if you want to build your relationship you should validate how much you appreciate how hard he worked on getting there, and how much appreciate him putting in so much effort to come to a concert just for you. I guess that\u2019s were his upset feelings mostly come from. He feels he put in all this effort and he did it for you but it wasn\u2019t reciprocated. From his point of view you are the asshole. I\u2019ve learned that in marriage. It doesn\u2019t matter that you cook all the time. If your husband brings out the trash without reminder, cooks supper or cleans the house - a simple thank you will make his day.", "NTA. He's gaslighting you. If it was important to him, he would've set an alarm and been there on time. As far as not making an effort to share their music with him, I frequently invite friends to concerts with me. If they ask, I'll send them a spotify link or the name of my favorite album, but otherwise, it's on them. Some just show up and enjoy the vibes, others listen to the music in advance.", "NTA, your bf is gaslighting you out of embarrassment that he overslept. He should grow up. Hope you enjoyed your gig.", "NTA but I guess I don\u2019t really understand why you are dating lol. You \u201cdon\u2019t care if he comes with you\u201d and he didn\u2019t seem to care that you asked him if he\u2019d want to come spend time with you. \n\nAlso I\u2019m dying to know how you ended up having to haul a camping backpack INTO a concert \ud83d\ude02", "ESH. He fell asleep and was late, but overall he still made an effort to be with you at an event that was important to you in order to share something with you. Instead, he spent the whole concert looking for you in a crowded venue. You could have a made a tiny bit of effort to connect with him once you knew he was at the place. Yes, you didn't make him go, but it's deeply discourteous of you to hope he found you once you were inside without trying. Could you have spent a tiny bit of time looking for him? Surely you could have still heard the concert whilst looking for him.", "ESH but take it with a grain of salt because I don't like live music that much, but you really should have looked for him inside or tried to find a way to be able to text him. Asks someone to watch the bag, check it, carry it. \n\nI'm not saying you two are incompatible over one situation, but neither of you can see the other's point right now. He gets it, you told him you only care about the concert, you love the band, he can come or not, it literally makes no difference to you as long as you get the see the concert, he's irrelevant. He seems like he understood how much you love the band and wanted to share that with you, but having him to share this with wasn't important to you. \n\nHe overslept and was late - that's super rude and an AH move. I'm always early, but I do not ascribe to the believe that if someone is late they don't respect you, life happens. To preface this I know everyone already disagrees with me, but if I were you I'd have either tried to find him and missed a song or two in the beginning, or apologized profusely after and said with the perfect storm of the bag, no signal and him being late you got too into the music and you're sorry. And he apologies for napping and you two work on better communication in the future.\n\nYou both just want to be right.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Otherwise, all he was doing was making you miss out.\n\nI'll give him the benefit of the doubt that I assume he's just frustrated that he rushed to come, missed the whole thing, and had to spend the whole time looking for someone.

I\u2019m so sorry I was late. I hope I didn\u2019t ruin your evening, by being late, I apologise. I know how excited you were to see this band. I hope you still enjoyed seeing them. Thank you for including me\u201d. End of. There was no need for an argument or to make you feel shitty.", "If you feel like he's gaslighting you frequently, that's a strong sign you should end the relationship.  He's 29 years old.  This is who he is.  He's not going to get better.", "The behavior looks like passive agressive punishment to me.\n\nThe point of the passive agressive man is to prevent you from getting what you want, in a way that makes it seem like they didn't \"do it\".\n\nThen he follows on with how he's the victim. You might google about it.", "I know \u201cdump him\u201d comments are all too common but sis if this dude is consistently gaslighting you\u2026 there are better dudes\u2026", "Run from him!", "He\u2019s not worth your time, OP.", "Just FYI, \"gaslighting\" is a very specific attempt to make someone permanently lose faith in their own judgment by lying and denying that real things are happening/happened. It comes from a movie (Gaslight), about a woman driven insane by her husband by changing the brightness of the gas lamps in the house and telling her she was imagining it. Anything other than that is just regular denying, lying, and deflecting (check out \"DARVO\").", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re seeing what he\u2019s doing clearly. You\u2019re not crazy, you\u2019re not overreacting.\n\nHe is trying to twist facts and events to manipulate you. \n\nAlso? I don\u2019t buy the \u2018I fell asleep\u2019 line. He was trying to get you to miss this. I 100% believe this was a calculated move and a power trip.\n\nHe\u2019s mad because he thought he had the ability to take this away from you and you didn\u2019t let him.\n\nNTA but please op don\u2019t put up with this. These kinds of behaviors never lead to anything good.\n\nGood luck op and I\u2019m glad you got to see your band.", "Even if it is a general location.", "If your husband brings out the trash without reminder, cooks supper or cleans the house", "I'm in my mid 30s. If my partner is running late and I have a big ass bag, I'm staying put with said big ass bag. If your lengthy adult relationship experience tells you that's not an okay thing to do, then I feel bad that you've normalized being a doormat to please inconsiderate partners.", "NTA\n\nIt was his own damn fault he was late. He needed to set an alarm. He knew you wanted to see this band. He is also quite capable of finding the music on his own.\n\nIf you keep the boyfriend, no more concerts with him. He added unnecessary stress to something he knew you were excited about because he won't admit that he was late because he was irresponsible", "NTA.\n\nI go to most of my concerts alone because I can't stand flaky people who make excuses and have no consideration for others. People like your bf.", "NTA\n\n1. If sending him a Spotify link isn\u2019t making an effort to show him the music I\u2019m not sure what is. He chose not to use that link. \n2. If he went to the concert for you that was nice of him, but his choice.\n3. He over slept and was late, but still expected you to miss some of the show to find him - and yet it\u2019s somehow your fault for ruining his evening?\n\nThis reads a lot like he is trying to make you take the blame for every singe failing of his in this situation. There is a word for that, a word that comes associated with all the red flags this situation reads like. \n\nPlease have a good hard look at every recent argument and his behaviour. Does he turn everything back on you often? Do you find yourself wondering if you were actually wrong? Does he fail to take how you feel into account regularly - especially when he\u2019s busy blaming you for something? Tread carefully - and if you feel he is gaslighting you after a good self check, run for the proverbial hills.", "NTA your bf sounds exhausting. Why are you still with him? Dump him, you can do better.", "INFO there was a miscommunication between two of your friends and all of a sudden you have a sleeping bag on your hands?  Just curious, I've never hear of that happening.", "NTA your BF is a tool. He couldn't even bother to put on an alarm to be on time. Hopefully this isn't a standard when it comes to things you enjoy and he wants to tack around.", "NTA, I have a zero tolerance for people who are late. Especially repeat offenders.", "You couldn't wait for a 2 mile trip to be done? Couldn't wait maybe 10 mins? \n\nYTA", "NTA. He is, though, for not valuing your time enough to make sure he was at your agreed upon spot at the agreed upon time. Even if you hadn\u2019t had a camping bag, you are under no obligation to spend the concert looking for someone. He\u2019s the one who was late, he\u2018s the one who should be looking for you.

He should have been apologizing for oversleeping and interfering with your enjoyment of the show.", "> when he was going out of his way for me.\n\nWhen did he do that? Cuz last time I checked coming late to an event isn\u2019t \u201cgoing out of your way\u201d for someone. \nAbsolutely NTA.", "Y.t.a. for using facts to win an argument with a child having a tantrum. NTA for sure. This entire fiasco was his fault for not meeting you on time. Why didn't he set an alarm?", "If my boyfriend wasn\u2019t the most apologetic person ever after standing me up for drinks for over an hour because he fell asleep that would be the end. NTA but wow he is", "NTA. I legit think he's trying to gaslight you and then trying turn it around on you and say that you're just trying to win the argument when you bring out the proof when actually he's lying to try to win the argument. You're just defending yourself and telling the truth.", "NTA.  Drop the trash", "NTA. Dump Him.", "I hate it when people don't understand that my napping is me going out of my way for them. /s", "NTA. He was horribly rude for not meeting you at the agreed 7pm time.

You\u2019re being extremely tactful by saying it was just a bad accidental situation rather than one he caused himself.  You\u2019re not even blaming him, you\u2019re just refusing to let him blame you!\n\nHow do interactions go when you do say he\u2019s in the wrong?  Is he ever able to admit he\u2019s made a mistake or ever apologize?", "Girl, dump him.", "Reddit is usually over the top with gaslighting accusations but this is textbook gaslighting too. He\u2019s making you question your reality, giving you all the responsibility for his mistakes and wanting you to take the blame. Classic DARVO. It\u2019s a low stakes situation but the pattern is clear", "If that is the case, OP, there's a chance he didn't even fall asleep. I mean, he had all these accusations ready to go - I bet doing what he did was more fun for him that watching the show.", "Agreed.  Also, a manta I had to learn, was that the impact on me is more important than his intensions.  Partner repeatedly hurts me but doesn\u2019t intend to, and I can see where he\u2019s coming from?  Irrelevant.  I\u2019m still being hurt repeatedly and that\u2019s the more important part of the equation.", "Exactly!!!", "\"Yay I finally found you! \\*kiss\\* I really enjoyed the show, thank you so much for turning me on to this band!\"", "DARVO is considered a form of gaslighting.", "Brb, just time-travelling to my 21-year-old self to give her that mantra.", "u/One_Stage_868 is a bot.", "I know, right?!  Took me 10+ years to learn that lesson.", "I had to actively rediscover anger as a legitimate emotion in my mid 20s.

Plus if someone is looking for you, it\u2019s best to stay put so it makes it easier to be found."]}
