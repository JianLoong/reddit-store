She\u2019s very cuddly and loving once she\u2018s gotten used to you.\nHowever, she was abused as a puppy and has separation anxiety. (EDIT: we\u2019ve been working with a professional trainer and she\u2019s been making improvements) but currently, leaving her home alone for more than an hour simple isn\u2018t possible. \nIt\u2018s hard to gain her trust and finding a dog sitter has been quite the struggle.\n\nThe last time I visited my brother (39M), his wife (42F) stepped on Lou\u2018s tale and quite obviously, it hurt. She didn\u2018t bite or even try do do so, but she barked quite loudly before running to hide behind me.\n\nI asked my SIL whether she way alright and she said she was, so I didn\u2019t think anything else of it. After all, she\u2018d known Lou for almost 2 years before the incident.\n\nBut when my brother invited me to his birthday party next weekend, he told me to leave Lou at home and when I asked for the reason, he told me SIL thought she was too aggressive to be around the guests.\n\nShe isn\u2018t, but it\u2018s their house, their rules and I want to respect her wishes, so I simply called the dog sitter who told me that unfortunately, they weren\u2019t available.\nAnyone else who has watched Lou in the past will also be at my brother\u2018s party so I don\u2018t have anyone to watch her.\n\nI told my brother I could either\n\na) bring Lou and keep her on leash at all times,\n\n\nor b) take Lou with me and take turns with my mum walking her around the neighbor so I could be able to stay a bit without his wife having to face my dog\n\nor c) come over (with Lou in the car) to congratulate him and bring over his present but leave shortly afterwards as I don\u2018t want her to be alone in the car for more than 15 minutes.\n\nHe told me that he didn\u2019t like any of these options because his wife didn\u2019t want my 'aggressive dog' on their property, in their driveway or in their neighborhood in general.\n\nI apologized and told him if that was the case, I wouldn\u2019t be able to come at all. \n\nHe has told me he\u2019s disappointed but especially my SIL has been bombarding me with texts about how I was selfish for putting my dog before my brother, and that I was an AH of a sister to do that to him on his 40th birthday.\n\nI think I have proposed reasonable enough compromises (EDIT: and because all of them were declined, I don\u2019t see what other options I have left except for staying home) but in the end, I\u2018d still like to hear the opinions of unbiased internet strangers to be sure.", "created_utc": 1684254524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j9za1/wibta_for_not_attending_my_brothers_birthday/", "score": 276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean, you can't bring the dog everywhere. She has separation anxiety, soooo vacation? work? a night out with friends? if you can't leave the dog for an hour or two, that has to be a burden", "NAH, with the slight exception of SIL because of her badgering. You seem pretty clear on the fact that you signed up for this lifestyle when you adopted Lou and you're comfortable with that. Your brother also seems pretty chill about the situation.", "NTA. Next time sitter is available, leave dog with them, and go out to do something for your brother\u2019s (belated) birthday and give him his present. There, simple.", "I understand your issue we to have a German Shepherd that was abandoned. He laid on the side of the road where he was left for 2 weeks waiting for his owner to return he then moved to a field and after 6 seeks he allowed people to feed him.

However, she was abused as a puppy and has separation anxiety.\"\n\nYou SIL is correct in not wanting your dog at her house for a party.\n\nYou gave 3 options.\n\n1. Absolutely NO!\n2. So you and your mom will walk Lou around the neighborhood for hours during the party. That is unrealistic at best, manipulative at worst. Because what will happen is you, your mom, or Lou will get tired of walking around and think that since Lou is tired, he should be allowed in to rest.\n3. Drop by party for 15 minutes while leaving Lou in the car. Objectively, acceptable but we all know what will happen. People will ask you to stay and you will blame SIL for not allowing Lou in.\n\n Your SIL understandably doesn't want your dog at the party. You can choose to not attend the party. NAH", "NTA - you've offered a series of options and they've refused them all. Just send a card and small gift and you're good. A party invite isn't a summons, you're free to decline for any reason.", "It's a birthday party, not a court summons.   \nYou offered alternatives, they said no.   \nImo, stepping on a dogs tail even if in accident, it will make a dog react.

Starting with where to put her feet.   \n\n\nNTA...", "I was so ready to be mad at you but you made a big effort and offered multiple reasonable compromises. It sucks you're not going, but NTA.", "NAH.  They have the right to ban the dog, you have a right to stay home.", "NTA. You tried to set everything up so you could go to the party and when you realized you couldn't get a sitter, you gave reasonable options instead of just saying you can't attend the party. You could also try to suggest celebrating your brother's birthday some other time, just the two of you or with a small group.\n\nI have two dogs and two cats and I know how hard it can be to plan your life around your pets. Some people just don't realize that pets aren't that easy to take care of and having pets can in some level be compared to having kids - you are responsible for a living being who needs support and thus you need to be ready to drop everything to help them. I hope everything goes well with your dog's training, give her some extra scratches from me!", "NAH - you did your best to compromise, and I'm an animal lover so I understand why you would side with the dog's needs. But ultimately, I'm going to agree with the sentiment that this situation isn't sustainable.\n\nYour brother is most likely not being an asshole either, and your SIL could just be supporting his hurt feelings. A lot of people, probably most (not redditors), don't agree with the idea that any animal should ever be prioritized over a human, especially your family. It sounds like your brother and SIL probably feel that way as well, and despite my personal love for animals I don't think there's anything objectively wrong about that perception. You most likely hurt your brother because of this situation, by essentially signaling to him that your dog is more important to you than he is. If you have any love for him you should definitely do something to make this up to him and make sure he knows he does matter to you.", "NTA because you tried. That being said, not being able to leave a dog for more than an hour seems really untenable in the long term. Have you worked with a professional trainer? I can't imagine how you would manage those kind of constraints and still have any kind of life, although I certainly admire your dedication to your dog.", "NTA", "Info\n\nDoes your brother live far away?\n\nWhy isn't option d) leave dog at home, come over for X minutes to give gift & say hi, then go home.", "I\u2019ve known two different dogs that were on Prozac \u2026 seriously you should consider meds. One a French bully would eat the bannister like they had to replace it multiple times cause she would chew through it. The other is a weimereiner (idk how to spell it haha) and he was so incredibly smart he learned how to open doors all on his own, even unlock it. Both of them stopped doing these things once put on Prozac and could be left alone safely. \n\nMaybe it won\u2019t work for your dog, but it would make your life and perhaps the dogs life better too. Just like people sometimes anxiety needs meds to get back to normal. \n\nNTA btw. It sucks that even backing out gets you berated by SIL.", "It may not be popular, but only you know how you feel about the commitment you made to help your pet. The way you choose to care for it and provide for it is up to you, and that includes how long you want to leave it alone.\n\nI am familiar in dealing with animal separation anxiety, and the time you're investing will likely pay off with improved behavior down the road. \n\nNAH. The brother and SIL have their feelings, and you have yours. Right now they don't align, and that's okay.", "NTA you SIL is unreasonable. You don\u2019t have to attend any family events, plus you put in effort to try to make it work. Turns out you can\u2019t make it work so you can\u2019t go. SIL demonizing you over it is absolutely ridiculous.", "d) train  the separation anxiety out of her. Takes about 3-6 months in my experience.\n\nYTA for not solving your dog's problem, and then expecting people to re-arrange their lives to accommodate that issue.", "NTA you where invited to the party. You can politely decline to go to a party. \n\nI have not been on vacation for 4 years because I have a large house dog. She doesn\u2019t do well in hot weather. She has separation anxiety for me to gone longer then 10-12 hours.  She is ok with my in-laws but starts to hunt for us after a few hours. So we simply don\u2019t go if we can\u2019t take her.\n\nDogs are a commitment that you sign up for.", "Nta.  He's allowed to say no dog, your allowed to not attend.  He's trying to control your decision which isn't fair.", "NTA and don\u2019t even worry about it. \n\nYou would be T A if you brought your dog to a place she isn\u2019t welcome. You can\u2019t bring her and you can\u2019t leave  her alone at home. Sooooo  it\u2019s pretty simple. You can\u2019t go to the party. \n\nYour SIL can just STFU about it. *She* is the roadblock to all the suggestions you offered to try to make this work.  SIL needs a little time out.", "NTA \n\nYou offered suggestions to meet your needs,  and your SIL declined.  So you declined the invite.\n\nDeclining an invite doesn't make you an AH.  Hounding someone who declines the invitation makes your SIL an AH.\n\nI get people saying they wouldn't want to put their lives on hold for a dog.  Awesome.  Don't adopt a dog, then.  OP did and is working through her dog's behavioral needs with a trainer, which is the right thing to do.\n\nIf there were a medical emergency and OP had to go to the hospital, that is a very different story than \"my brother is having a birthday party.\"\n\nI love dogs and generally don't want other peoples' dogs at my house regardless of how nice those dogs are.  I accept that sometimes that means a dog owner can't come over if they have to fulfill their responsibilities to their dog.", "NTA. You tried to find a solution that would work for everyone. In the end, you weren't able to, so you're not going. That's fair.\n\nSIL needs to lay off bombarding you with texts. It's doing nothing but exacerbating the situation.", "SIL is being TA for trying to tell you that your dog can\u2019t even be in the neighborhood. Unless you\u2019re leaving out a huge bit of info regarding the barking incident, it sounds like she\u2019s being unreasonable.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou offered what solutions you were able to given the circumstances and they declined all of them, automatic not an asshole territory.  I also cannot stress this enough, you aren't REQUIRED to go to a party, especially when you attempting to respect their rules is why you are unable to attend in the first place.", "NTA. Your SIL sucks. \n\nYou have made an effort and she's basically acting like a toddler.", "INFO\n\n> leaving her home alone for more than an hour simple isn\u2018t possible.\n\nWhy not? Like, what *actually* happens? Just crate her.", "NTA and your SIL has gone completely over the top if she doesn't want your dog even in the neighborhood or locked in your car (windows down or AC on obv) in her driveway.  Your SIL has issues that are not your responsibility.  Take no blame, accept no shame.", "NTA\n\nBarking and running away *after having a tail stepped on* isn\u2019t aggressive.\n\nWhile I do think it\u2019s not an asshole move to not welcome your dog, it IS an asshole move to pull this \u201cyou put your dog before us\u201d nonsense when current circumstances means you can\u2019t leave your dog alone and your current sitter isn\u2019t available. It\u2019s also wild to act possessive over the neighborhood.\n\nHopefully your pet continues to improve with training.

Otherwise you gotta do what you gotta do.", "You need to get your dog, an emotional support dog.  \n\nIt is not ok to neglect your family because a pet has problems.

I am leaning on the side of they are AH for the way they talk about the dog like it's so aggressive it shouldn't be in their neighborhood. Like you hurtthe dog,it reacted. I've never met a dog that doesn't make a noise when you step on its tail but barking does not equal aggression, especially coupled with cowering behind their owner.

She\u2019s very cuddly and loving once she\u2018s gotten used to you.\nHowever, she was abused as a puppy and has separation anxiety so leaving her home alone for more than an hour simple isn\u2018t possible. \nIt\u2018s hard to gain her trust and finding a dog sitter has been quite the struggle.\n\nThe last time I visited my brother (39M), his wife (42F) stepped on Lou\u2018s tale and quite obviously, it hurt. She didn\u2018t bite or even try do do so, but she barked quite loudly before running to hide behind me.\n\nI asked my SIL whether she way alright and she said she was, so I didn\u2019t think anything else of it. After all, she\u2018d known Lou for almost 2 years before the incident.\n\nBut when my brother invited me to his birthday party next weekend, he told me to leave Lou at home and when I asked for the reason, he told me SIL thought she was too aggressive to be around the guests.\n\nShe isn\u2018t, but it\u2018s their house, their rules so I simply called the dog sitter who told me that unfortunately, they weren\u2019t available.\nAnyone else who has watched Lou in the past will also be at my brother\u2018s party so I don\u2018t have anyone to watch her.\n\nI told my brother I could either\n\na) bring Lou and keep her on leash at all times,\n\n\nor b) take Lou with me and take turns with my mum walking her around the neighbor so I could be able to stay a bit without his wife having to face my dog\n\nor c) come over (with Lou in the car) to congratulate him and bring over his present but leave shortly afterwards as I don\u2018t want her to be alone in the car for more than 15 minutes.\n\nHe told me that he didn\u2019t like any of these options because his wife didn\u2019t want my 'aggressive dog' on their property, in their driveway or in their neighborhood in general.\n\nI apologized and told him if that was the case, I wouldn\u2019t be able to come at all. \n\nHe has told me he\u2019s disappointed but especially my SIL has been bombarding me with texts about how I was selfish for putting my dog before my brother, and that I was an AH of a sister to do that to him on his 40th birthday.\n\nI think I have proposed reasonable enough compromises but in the end, I\u2018d still like to hear the opinions of unbiased internet strangers to be sure.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
