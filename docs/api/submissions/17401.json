She\u2019s very cuddly and loving once she\u2018s gotten used to you.\nHowever, she was abused as a puppy and has separation anxiety. (EDIT: we\u2019ve been working with a professional trainer and she\u2019s been making improvements) but currently, leaving her home alone for more than an hour simple isn\u2018t possible (EDIT: and my brother lives 45 minutes away).\nIt\u2018s hard to gain her trust, so getting someone to watch her on short notice is nearly impossible.\n\nThe last time I visited my brother (39M), his wife (42F) stepped on Lou\u2018s tale and quite obviously, it hurt. She didn\u2018t bite or even try do do so, but she barked quite loudly before running to hide behind me.\n\nI asked my SIL whether she way alright and she said she was, so I didn\u2019t think anything else of it. After all, she\u2018d known Lou for almost 2 years before the incident.\n\nBut when my brother invited me to his birthday party next weekend, he told me to leave Lou at home and when I asked for the reason, he told me SIL thought she was too aggressive to be around the guests.\n\nShe isn\u2018t, but it\u2018s their house, their rules and I want to respect her wishes, so I simply called my usual dog sitter who told me that unfortunately, they weren\u2019t available.\nAnyone else who has watched Lou in the past will also be at my brother\u2018s party so I don\u2018t have anyone to watch her.\n\nI told my brother I could either\n\na) bring Lou and keep her on leash at all times,\n\n\nor b) take Lou with me and take turns with my mum walking her around the neighbor so I could be able to stay a bit without his wife having to face my dog\n\nor c) come over (with Lou in the car) to congratulate him and bring over his present but leave shortly afterwards as I don\u2018t want her to be alone in the car for more than 15 minutes.\n\nHe told me that he didn\u2019t like any of these options because his wife didn\u2019t want my 'aggressive dog' on their property, in their driveway or in their neighborhood in general.\n\nI apologized and told him if that was the case, I wouldn\u2019t be able to come at all. \n\nHe has told me he\u2019s disappointed but especially my SIL has been bombarding me with texts about how I was selfish for putting my dog before my brother, and that I was an AH of a sister to do that to him on his 40th birthday.\n\nI think I have proposed reasonable enough compromises (EDIT: and because all of them were declined, I don\u2019t see what other options I have left except for staying home) but in the end, I\u2018d still like to hear the opinions of unbiased internet strangers to be sure.", "created_utc": 1684254524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13j9za1/wibta_for_not_attending_my_brothers_birthday/", "score": 6450, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There, simple.", "I understand your issue we to have a German Shepherd that was abandoned. He laid on the side of the road where he was left for 2 weeks waiting for his owner to return he then moved to a field and after 6 seeks he allowed people to feed him.

However, she was abused as a puppy and has separation anxiety.\"\n\nYou SIL is correct in not wanting your dog at her house for a party.\n\nYou gave 3 options.\n\n1. Absolutely NO!\n2. So you and your mom will walk Lou around the neighborhood for hours during the party. That is unrealistic at best, manipulative at worst. Because what will happen is you, your mom, or Lou will get tired of walking around and think that since Lou is tired, he should be allowed in to rest.\n3. Drop by party for 15 minutes while leaving Lou in the car. Objectively, acceptable but we all know what will happen. People will ask you to stay and you will blame SIL for not allowing Lou in.\n\n Your SIL understandably doesn't want your dog at the party. You can choose to not attend the party.

A party invite isn't a summons, you're free to decline for any reason.", "It's a birthday party, not a court summons.   \nYou offered alternatives, they said no.   \nImo, stepping on a dogs tail even if in accident, it will make a dog react.

Starting with where to put her feet.   \n\n\nNTA...", "I was so ready to be mad at you but you made a big effort and offered multiple reasonable compromises. It sucks you're not going, but NTA.", "NAH.  They have the right to ban the dog, you have a right to stay home.", "NTA. You tried to set everything up so you could go to the party and when you realized you couldn't get a sitter, you gave reasonable options instead of just saying you can't attend the party. You could also try to suggest celebrating your brother's birthday some other time, just the two of you or with a small group.\n\nI have two dogs and two cats and I know how hard it can be to plan your life around your pets. Some people just don't realize that pets aren't that easy to take care of and having pets can in some level be compared to having kids - you are responsible for a living being who needs support and thus you need to be ready to drop everything to help them. I hope everything goes well with your dog's training, give her some extra scratches from me!", "NAH - you did your best to compromise, and I'm an animal lover so I understand why you would side with the dog's needs. But ultimately, I'm going to agree with the sentiment that this situation isn't sustainable.\n\nYour brother is most likely not being an asshole either, and your SIL could just be supporting his hurt feelings. A lot of people, probably most (not redditors), don't agree with the idea that any animal should ever be prioritized over a human, especially your family. It sounds like your brother and SIL probably feel that way as well, and despite my personal love for animals I don't think there's anything objectively wrong about that perception. You most likely hurt your brother because of this situation, by essentially signaling to him that your dog is more important to you than he is. If you have any love for him you should definitely do something to make this up to him and make sure he knows he does matter to you.", "NTA because you tried. That being said, not being able to leave a dog for more than an hour seems really untenable in the long term. Have you worked with a professional trainer? I can't imagine how you would manage those kind of constraints and still have any kind of life, although I certainly admire your dedication to your dog.", "NTA", "Info\n\nDoes your brother live far away?\n\nWhy isn't option d) leave dog at home, come over for X minutes to give gift & say hi, then go home.", "I\u2019ve known two different dogs that were on Prozac \u2026 seriously you should consider meds. One a French bully would eat the bannister like they had to replace it multiple times cause she would chew through it. The other is a weimereiner (idk how to spell it haha) and he was so incredibly smart he learned how to open doors all on his own, even unlock it. Both of them stopped doing these things once put on Prozac and could be left alone safely. \n\nMaybe it won\u2019t work for your dog, but it would make your life and perhaps the dogs life better too. Just like people sometimes anxiety needs meds to get back to normal. \n\nNTA btw. It sucks that even backing out gets you berated by SIL.", "It may not be popular, but only you know how you feel about the commitment you made to help your pet. The way you choose to care for it and provide for it is up to you, and that includes how long you want to leave it alone.\n\nI am familiar in dealing with animal separation anxiety, and the time you're investing will likely pay off with improved behavior down the road. \n\nNAH. The brother and SIL have their feelings, and you have yours. Right now they don't align, and that's okay.", "NTA you SIL is unreasonable. You don\u2019t have to attend any family events, plus you put in effort to try to make it work. Turns out you can\u2019t make it work so you can\u2019t go. SIL demonizing you over it is absolutely ridiculous.", "d) train  the separation anxiety out of her. Takes about 3-6 months in my experience.\n\nYTA for not solving your dog's problem, and then expecting people to re-arrange their lives to accommodate that issue.", "NTA you where invited to the party. You can politely decline to go to a party. \n\nI have not been on vacation for 4 years because I have a large house dog. She doesn\u2019t do well in hot weather. She has separation anxiety for me to gone longer then 10-12 hours.  She is ok with my in-laws but starts to hunt for us after a few hours. So we simply don\u2019t go if we can\u2019t take her.\n\nDogs are a commitment that you sign up for.", "Nta.  He's allowed to say no dog, your allowed to not attend.

You can\u2019t bring her and you can\u2019t leave  her alone at home. Sooooo  it\u2019s pretty simple. You can\u2019t go to the party. \n\nYour SIL can just STFU about it. *She* is the roadblock to all the suggestions you offered to try to make this work.  SIL needs a little time out.", "NTA \n\nYou offered suggestions to meet your needs,  and your SIL declined.  So you declined the invite.\n\nDeclining an invite doesn't make you an AH.  Hounding someone who declines the invitation makes your SIL an AH.\n\nI get people saying they wouldn't want to put their lives on hold for a dog.  Awesome.  Don't adopt a dog, then.  OP did and is working through her dog's behavioral needs with a trainer, which is the right thing to do.\n\nIf there were a medical emergency and OP had to go to the hospital, that is a very different story than \"my brother is having a birthday party.\"\n\nI love dogs and generally don't want other peoples' dogs at my house regardless of how nice those dogs are.  I accept that sometimes that means a dog owner can't come over if they have to fulfill their responsibilities to their dog.", "NTA. You tried to find a solution that would work for everyone. In the end, you weren't able to, so you're not going. That's fair.\n\nSIL needs to lay off bombarding you with texts. It's doing nothing but exacerbating the situation.", "SIL is being TA for trying to tell you that your dog can\u2019t even be in the neighborhood. Unless you\u2019re leaving out a huge bit of info regarding the barking incident, it sounds like she\u2019s being unreasonable.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou offered what solutions you were able to given the circumstances and they declined all of them, automatic not an asshole territory.  I also cannot stress this enough, you aren't REQUIRED to go to a party, especially when you attempting to respect their rules is why you are unable to attend in the first place.", "NTA. Your SIL sucks. \n\nYou have made an effort and she's basically acting like a toddler.", "[deleted]", "NTA and your SIL has gone completely over the top if she doesn't want your dog even in the neighborhood or locked in your car (windows down or AC on obv) in her driveway.  Your SIL has issues that are not your responsibility.  Take no blame, accept no shame.", "NTA\n\nBarking and running away *after having a tail stepped on* isn\u2019t aggressive.\n\nWhile I do think it\u2019s not an asshole move to not welcome your dog, it IS an asshole move to pull this \u201cyou put your dog before us\u201d nonsense when current circumstances means you can\u2019t leave your dog alone and your current sitter isn\u2019t available.

She\u2019s very cuddly and loving once she\u2018s gotten used to you.\nHowever, she was abused as a puppy and has separation anxiety so leaving her home alone for more than an hour simple isn\u2018t possible. \nIt\u2018s hard to gain her trust and finding a dog sitter has been quite the struggle.\n\nThe last time I visited my brother (39M), his wife (42F) stepped on Lou\u2018s tale and quite obviously, it hurt. She didn\u2018t bite or even try do do so, but she barked quite loudly before running to hide behind me.\n\nI asked my SIL whether she way alright and she said she was, so I didn\u2019t think anything else of it. After all, she\u2018d known Lou for almost 2 years before the incident.\n\nBut when my brother invited me to his birthday party next weekend, he told me to leave Lou at home and when I asked for the reason, he told me SIL thought she was too aggressive to be around the guests.\n\nShe isn\u2018t, but it\u2018s their house, their rules so I simply called the dog sitter who told me that unfortunately, they weren\u2019t available.\nAnyone else who has watched Lou in the past will also be at my brother\u2018s party so I don\u2018t have anyone to watch her.\n\nI told my brother I could either\n\na) bring Lou and keep her on leash at all times,\n\n\nor b) take Lou with me and take turns with my mum walking her around the neighbor so I could be able to stay a bit without his wife having to face my dog\n\nor c) come over (with Lou in the car) to congratulate him and bring over his present but leave shortly afterwards as I don\u2018t want her to be alone in the car for more than 15 minutes.\n\nHe told me that he didn\u2019t like any of these options because his wife didn\u2019t want my 'aggressive dog' on their property, in their driveway or in their neighborhood in general.\n\nI apologized and told him if that was the case, I wouldn\u2019t be able to come at all. \n\nHe has told me he\u2019s disappointed but especially my SIL has been bombarding me with texts about how I was selfish for putting my dog before my brother, and that I was an AH of a sister to do that to him on his 40th birthday.\n\nI think I have proposed reasonable enough compromises but in the end, I\u2018d still like to hear the opinions of unbiased internet strangers to be sure.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What happens if you or a loved one have a medical emergency and all your sitters are busy? You might want to find a new trainer, because the one you have now isn't helping you.  It's reasonable for, assuming a couple years of work, an adult dog to be able to manage several hours at home alone. You're not doing Lou any favors by failing to meet her needs.  Dogs are happier when they are well-adjusted and able to socialize with people and not just their owner and a couple sitters.", "Yes you are. It\u2019s unreasonable to have a pet that you cannot leave at home for a couple of hours. You\u2019ve had it for years and it can\u2019t be left alone??? Put in the garage or something, go to the part, the dog will not be harmed if you leave it alone. It needs to get accustomed to it at some point. Sounds like a you problem that you are blaming on the dog", "It\u2019s your decision to put your dog above everybody else but don\u2019t be surprised when you stop getting invites to things", "I\"m having trouble with the part where you've had this dog for at least two years (and professional training) and you can't leave the dog alone for more than an hour.   How do you go to work and have a social life?   Is this dog some sort of ESA?  \n\nBasically I'm leaning toward a mild YTA because you have a large dog with admitted behavioral issues and it probably feels like you're trying to force your dog into a situation where it's not welcome.  (NOT saying you're doing that intentionally but you have to at least admit that's how it looks to your brother and his family.) My experience with dog owners (and FYI I love dogs) is that hey have a blind spot about how friendly/low maintenance/trouble free their dogs actually are.  \n\nNone of your solutions are particularly optimal.  A is simply out of the question.  B is pretty disruptive to the party  C is probably the best of the three (though it sounds as if your brother doesn't trust you to actually keep the dog in the car....OPPS he got out...isn't he cute...who wants to pet him...    Tell your brother you love him and if you could find a dog sitter you'd absolutely be there to celebrate then send a REALLY nice gift to the party with your mom.", "NTA. You offered compromise and solutions, they didn't like them and offered no other option.", "Nta. You accepted their request to not bring the dog without acting like a brat. You gave them 3 options where you would be able to attend for varying lengths of time. They didn't like their choices. As you said, that leaves only one option for you that YOU would be comfortable with, staying home with your dog. They have no right to be upset about your lack of attendance. It was an invitation, not a summons.", "NTA - you gave options they rejected.\n\nHow far away is your brother's place? Could you not go and drive back within an hour?", "NTA\n\nIf SIL does not want your dog in her vicinity and you are not able to get a dog sitter, you have no option other than not attending.  Arrange to see your brother at another time.", "NTA for not going. But your dog is scary and aggressive and you\u2019re in denial about it.", "NTA. I wanted to call you the AH early on, but with the options you gave you aren\u2019t the AH. Neither is your brother for being upset. The only AH here is the SIL. She seams like an overbearing control freak and sadly this is going to ruin your relationship with your brother.", "NAH", "Given your dog's current challenges, and the lack of an available pet sitter, it seems like it's pretty much impossible for you to attend your brother's party without the dog.  This makes you not the asshole, since you can't really do the impossible.  I guess your best option would be to get your brother's gift to your mom or another family member ahead of time, or mail it.  \n\n\nSister in law is also not the asshole for deciding she doesn't want your dog in her home.  Personally I couldn't allow anybody to bring their pet to our home for whatever reason (we have a very anxious cat who gets very distressed around other animals) and I don't think it's being an asshole to say sorry you can't bring your pet to our home for whatever reason.  \n\n\nBut what I think does make the sister in law an asshole is saying you can't bring the dog, knowing that you can't leave the dog alone, and still going off on you for not attending even though you can't.  Instead of going off on you, she could offer alternatives (maybe meet up at a park with the dog on a leash?) rather than getting mad at you for being unable to do what's currently impossible for you given the situation with you and your dog.  \n\n\nMy verdict: NTA", "Definitely NTA. Rather than just saying you weren't going, you provided options which was good, and if they refused they can't really be mad at you because you did have options for it, overall, NTA", "Info: do you work from home?  I fail to see how the dog can't be alone for an hour if you work or have some kind of life outside your dog.", "I feel like there is more to this story. Either the dog is aggressive, behavior has been reinforced, or there is something else. This is extreme that after having the dog for so long to not be able to leave the house for an hour. There are many options for being able to leave a dog with SA. Something just doesn't add up to me.", "YTA.  Dogs do not need to go with people \\*everywhere\\*.  They told you no, respect their decision and stay home if that's what you need to do.", "NTA pets are family and their needs must be prioritized. You agreed to care for your dog and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing. You offered multiple options, if they declined them all, then the priority of your dog\u2019s needs come before a birthday party. \n\nYou are not a bad sister, you tried multiple avenues to find a solution that would work for everyone. You\u2019re a very good dog owner. Im sure you can take your brother out to lunch or something on a different day to celebrate, but the fundamental safety and mental health needs of your dog come before his non-necessary need to have you at a party.\n\nAnyone who gives you grief over caring for your dog is lacking empathy. Dogs have needs too, and neglecting them is not ok. I have 3 dogs, and they will ALWAYS come first over non necessary things. I\u2019ve missed several events because of my dogs and i don\u2019t regret it at all, I love my dogs and they\u2019re my family too. They\u2019re a commitment, and there\u2019s no shame in being committed.", "NTA: I would be a bit disappointed if a loved one couldn't come to my birthday party because of their pet, but I would respect that choice. I certainly wouldn't berate you or let my partner berate you. Also, birthday parties are nice and all, but for adults, it's kind buxarre to insist people attend. \nI hope you can find a way to celebrate with your brother, even if it's not at his birthday party.", "I think your dog can go more than an hour without you\u2026", "I'm ready to get downvoted, but YTA. I understand your SIL's hesitation given everything you've described about this dog. It sounds like at a busy party, there's a good chance of your dog getting stressed and barking at/ jumping at guests. So it makes sense that she wouldn't want it there.\n\nThis is your brother's 40th, a pretty big milestone, and you're choosing to be with the dog instead of celebrating with him. I refuse to believe that there isn't a single option for you. There are so many pet-sitting apps these days with verified users where you could find a sitter. And worse comes to worst, you could find a local pet boarding place and see if they'll look after your dog for a couple of hours.\n\nIt's commendable that you're supporting your dog through all the abuse, and it sounds like you're a very loving pet owner. But in this case, it's at the expense of your family. Whether he admits it or not, your brother will be hurt if you don't turn up to his 40th birthday party. It's not on him and your SIL to accommodate your dog and find solutions, it's *your* dog. You should be looking into alternative pet-sitting options and hitting up all the different apps and websites so that you can be there for your brother.", "NAH.\n\nSeparation Anxiety in dogs is quite hard to deal with and takes a lot of training. There is no quick fix. You are doing the responsible thing as a dog owner by not leaving her in a stressful situation, not leaving her for too long, and not leaving her with a stranger. Your SIL may think you\u2019re an asshole for doing so, but anyone whose worked with dogs would know that doing those things may make your dog\u2019s anxiety worse and set back your training. You are already doing what you can by working with a trainer. \n\nBeing barked at by a dog can be scary (especially if you have had bad experiences with dogs in the past). I understand why she may not want option A, but option C is reasonable enough. If she isn\u2019t okay with any of those options, it\u2019s pretty obvious you can\u2019t come come.

I wonder if it\u2019s stemming from a reason *besides* your dog.", "NTA, you offered several alternatives that would permit you to attend the party given the situation, they rejected all of them, so you're not going. What else do they expect you to do? They can call you \"selfish\" all they want but I'm not seeing a proposal for what actions they think you should take instead.", "Eh ESH \n\nThey\u2019re being unbending. You are choosing a very unsustainable lifestyle if you want to support your loved ones by being present for important events.", "Why do people think they need to bring their dogs everywhere? I have dogs. I do not take them shopping, to other people\u2019s home or to any public venues unless they are specifically dog friendly.", "I would reply to SIL - \"it is not a matter of putting one above the other, I would like to attend but do not have a sitter for my dog, I came up with a few solutions, but these don't work as your not happy to have dog on your property, that's your call but leaves me out of options, as much as this may disappoint my brother, leaving my dog would cause him considerable emotional distress, emotional distress trumps disappointment.\"", "NTA, but this is a very weird family dynamic.", "Listen, I also have a German Shepherd with separation anxiety - a lot of people in these comments are just not familiar with the breed or know that they are exceptionally prone to this. I have only ever had GSD's, my current one is my 5th, and all of them have had some level of anxiety. Ignore everyone that is acting like your dog is 'broken' or it's just something that should've/could've been fixed with a certain type of training. That being said, this is something that you can work on until you get to a point that a few hours alone in her 'safe place' aka your home is doable. But it takes time. It took me two years with a dog that's suffered no abuse or trauma, so it will take you longer, but you will get there with perseverance. (you're welcome to direct message for advice or just to chat about it)\n\nAs for the SIL thing - look, you can't make everyone like your dog. The amount of people that react badly to mine, he's long haired and 50kg, he looks like a ginormous wolf, but he's incredibly gentle, loves kittens, and has never shown aggression in his life, but he still scares people that aren't used to big dogs and unfortunately its just one of those things that come with owning these dogs. Your SIL is just being a bitch to some extent, she has no right to say whether your dog is in the neighbourhood, but I suspect that this is just the excuse she's been looking for anyway. You don't stand on a dogs tail and when they reasonably react to the pain, decide it's aggressive. Plus, if this is the real story, everyone at that party you say is usually happy to dog sit your dog will also back you up she isn't aggressive. You tried to speak to your sitter, they're unavailable, you'd have asked others but they're also unavailable as they're attending he same party, you offered multiple alternative options and they were declined, so you have made reasonable efforts to resolve the situation. Don't be gaslighted into being made to feel like you're putting your dog first because you have made efforts to attend the party. So don't go. \n\nI'm gonna be honest though, I like my dog a lot more than a lot of my family so I personally would skip out some family events in favour of staying with my dog anyway, so perhaps my perception is off lmao.

I'm guessing there may be an incident somewhere that has given them some rights to concern.", "NTA. So many people here don't understand what it's like to have a dog with separation anxiety and the long and frustrating process to work through a dog's separation anxiety. Separation anxiety isn't cultivated. Some dogs are more prone genetically to separation anxiety, and some may come with it because of their backgrounds. My rescue dog has severe separation anxiety. She was neglected as a puppy and came to us malnourished and with a host of other issues. \n\nIf OP undertaking training and working with a trainer, OP CANNOT leave the dog alone for more than the time period it could tolerate (or at all, even). That's the best practice, and if OP ups and leaves for longer than the dog could tolerate, it risks setting back the progress. I don't know where OP started, but since we started working with our trainer 5 months ago we have not left the dog alone at all. We either take her with us, host, or drop her off at doggy daycare/sitter's place (we're lucky she's really good with other dogs). It also took us this long to have the dog stay at home alone for 35 minutes by herself without triggering her anxiety (also, it took us two weeks to get to five minutes of alone time when we started). It's a hard process that takes a ridiculous amount of time commitment and patience. Setbacks with training are also frequent, as some little thing could trigger the dog's anxiety. \n\nOP, don't listen to people who are saying that you need to \"grow up\" or who doubt you. I empathize 100% and know you're doing the best you can by your dog. You gave so many options, and your brother turned down all of them.

They don\u2019t have rights to control public spaces. So, you don\u2019t actually need their permission or blessing to do the alternating who walks the dog around the neighborhood as long as you were to park on the street and keep Lou off of their actual private property, but that wouldn\u2019t stop them from being angry at you and reacting however they choose to react to that and the end result could easily be worse than those of skipping the birthday party.

So something's up, at least to me.", "Are you saying that you\u2019ve had Lou for 2 years, and you still cannot leave her alone for at least an hour? That is a long time for this problem to be so severe. Do you have any other dogs or is she alone? Do you need to hire a sitter every single time you leave the house? Do you have a yard?\n\nWhat does she do when separated? Panic and destroy your house? Howl for hours and upset the neighbors? Does she panic immediately and destroy everything, or can she go for at least some time? Are you leaving her in the house or backyard? Will she jump out of your fence?\n\nSevere separation anxiety in dogs is a panic disorder. Some dogs are just born with it, while others acquire it. \n\nIf your dog has anxiety so bad that she will destroy your couch or go through drywall, like my friend\u2019s dog did, then leaving her home is not an option right now. \n\nYou mentioned that you are working with a trainer, which is good. However, it\u2019s been two years, and you are essentially unable to leave the house unless you get a pet sitter, if I understand you correctly. This problem needs to be solved, because you are vulnerable in case of an emergency, and living with panic lessens the quality of life for Lou. \n\nSome dogs respond well to brief periods of time in a crate, such as Impact Crates. They are built to withstand escape artists, and their den like nature can feel comforting to some dogs, whereas an open mesh crate makes them feel exposed and trapped. If you go the crate route, ensure it is one they cannot get their teeth stuck on, and play crate games so they associate their crate with fun, special treats, and safety. \n\nHopefully, your trainer is a good fit, because you have to be able to leave your dog alone. You can\u2019t just abstain from going to the hospital because your dog can\u2019t be alone. \n\nAs for your brother\u2019s party, your SIL has no say over a dog in your locked car, or walking in her neighborhood.", "YTA if you don't provide immediate dog tax :) /s \n\nFor real tho, NTA - you've provided many reasonable compromises and if SIL still isn't happy with them then there's nothing more you can do.

She has to learn to be alone, even if she's uncomfortable. What if you were hospitalized? How do you grocery shop? What if she had to stay overnight at the vet? The more she's with you every minute, the more she'll think she HAS to be with you every minute. I had a rescued dog that was taken to the vet to be put down because she didn't like to be crated so the owners locked her in the bathroom, where she tore the drywall down.

Assuming you have at least some regard for your pet's mental health, there are many reasons that it can be difficult to board/get a sitter. There are some breeds that require specialized training/experience no matter how well trained they are. I'm not leaving an OE/English bulldog, Chow Chow, Neo/Bordeaux/Tibetan mastiff, Husky, Border Collie, etc. with an untested sitter or Kennel. I'm iffy on anything like a bull/English mastiff, Great Dane or Rottweiler unless they have experience with the super giants.

The neuro-vet says that anxiety is very common in dogs with epilepsy.  \nThrough medication and specialized training he is doing much better, but some parts of his anxiety remain.\nI often wonder how so many people know that their dog had been abused before they got them and how many use it as an excuse to permit bad behavior or worse, overlook a true medical illness.", "OP stated though that the dog upon having their tail stepped on barked and ran behind her \u2026 a yelp out of a German Shepherd is also pretty damn loud and jarring.", "Anyone with a GSD knows that we have loud dogs, but if one reacted in a way other than bark and retreat when its tail was stepped on there would have been blood and stitches at a minimum.

There's a very real possibility that guests might pressure OP or SIL to just bring the dog inside so they can stay longer. Its SIL's house, and she's allowed to decide against having the dog at this party. That includes eliminating the possibility of an awkward situation where others pressure SIL on her boundaries. After all, we don't truly know her history or potential guests history with anxious/reactive dogs. \n\nI've had two abused dogs with separation anxiety, and it was only through very diligent and consistent training that issues improved.

Being in the shelter is a really traumatic experience, especially city pounds (and most adopted animals in the US filter through these). In most shelters animals are never socialized, never leave their cages, often times they may not even get regular meals, and they are surrounded by a huge number of other extremely stressed-out animals. Even a previously well-adjusted pet will develop issues in that kind of environment. Puppy-mill dogs, strays, and dogs that grew up in the shelter are already suffering from neglect and are more prone to develop maladaptive behavior. \n\nThe unfortunate truth is that almost ALL dogs coming out of shelters need to be (re)trained to reenter society successfully. They lack the social skills they need to communicate and interact with humans and dogs. Sadly most people don't have the knowledge and tools they need to do so, and most people just end up living with the dog's behavior. It's the end result of a cash-driven pet industry that pumps out millions of dogs every year that end up in the hands of people who don't KNOW that they don't know anything about dogs (but that's a rant for another time).\n\nSource: working at shelters", "I think a big part of the issue with everyone claiming their adopted dog was abused is that 1) people confuse bad habits and poor training with abuse and 2) people lump every type of abuse under one vague concept and fail to understand the importance of nuance.\n\nFor example, my cat was technically abused but only in that her previous owners were crappy people who had her declawed, had way too many pets for any cat to just get dumped in with, and were very neglectful. They didn't hit her or starve her, but based on the info they volunteered when they gave her up for peeing everywhere, being mostly ignored while having to share a single litter box with at least 2 very dominant cats and living with several other animals was really bad for a cat recovering from essentially having all her fingers amputated at the knuckle. (look up what declaring actually involves. It's horrifying)\n\n\n\nA good amount of shelter pets have been through some rough stuff, but yeah, it definitely gets exaggerated", "I think she was asking SIL if the dog was ok.", "Aliens", "I'm really not trying to be heartless here, but what's the point of having a dog that will literally never be okay on it's own? At that point, you don't have a pet, you have an abusive relationship.", "\u2026especially one of that size, since many big dogs don\u2019t know their own size and/or strength\u2026", "You\u2019re probably correct. But reactive dogs with separation anxiety have been around forever, so it\u2019s possibly unrelated to the pandemic/WFH. Source: I have four reactive rescues that are unrelated to the pandemic- that\u2019s just my thing.", "The behavior you allow is the behavior you get. This is true of both humans *and* dogs. What\u2019s cute when they\u2019re puppies (or babies) isn\u2019t cute when you have a 60 lbs. dog jumping on you. Or a thirteen year old telling you to fuck off. \n\nBoundaries and rules are required for a polite society. And by bringing dogs into our society they need to be bound by rules of behavior that above all keeps *them* safe. \n\nLove, \n\nA dog trainer with 20+ years experience", "I'm not saying something can't happen to a dog at less than 8 weeks that stays with them for life, but it's *highly* unlikely. That poor dog - I always hate when people who aren't prepared to train dogs get dogs and let them be poorly behaved. It just means the dog is forever doing things that make people unhappy with them, but they're never properly taught how not to do that.", "Correction, would have to admit she is not a good dog owner.", "That sounds like something an alien would say."]}
