That's a man. However she should have been prepared after the first time and she should have cleaned his seat herself. She's pretty nasty if she's bleeding through and not cleaning it up.", ">and not demand to bleed all over the damn world.\n\nThat made me laugh xd", "Maybe! Two paper towels would work for me like sitting in the office until I can get out at lunch. But it would definitely seep through on a bike.", "10 minute drive in a car? Absolutely.\n\n10 minute drive straddling a bike seat? Absolutely NOT", "That\u2019s the problem with most of the comments here- people are wildly variable in so many regards- why not consider that re: periods as well?  I know at least three people off the top of my head that suffer from really intense and awful periods. As in, they bleed through the strongest absorbency tampons, and the back-up pad (the overnight kind) and then through clothing and seating. This can happen within 30 minutes of freshly arming the netherworld with fresh supplies. \n\nWe\u2019re all humans and everything the human body experiences is NORMAL in some sense. Like a bell curve. Somebody\u2019s gotta be on the low end and that applies to periods and all else.", "Disagree with that last bit. Circumstances can be quite nuanced. Calling someone fat in the heat of the moment is different than taking a shit in your hand and slapping the neighbor with it in the heat of the moment. If they can provide valid reasoning it\u2019s not hypocritical.", "\n\n>I don't say weird bullshit that I don't mean just because I'm embarrassed or angry.\n\nWell, good for you for dodging a very human trait. Props.\n\nEdit - to be clear, I'm not standing up for either of them. This is ESH for me. But, to never say weird bs when emotions are high, is truly a virtue.", "So... you're saying you don't understand the difference between a bicycle and a car?", "Not to mention the wet-then-crusty appearance and/or feel of it. Nooooo", "the argument was that this behaviour could be explained by both of them being 13 but *in that case* accidents within 15 minutes don't happen", "agreed.  while i'm still using a tracker to help keep track, my body doesnt' follow it  lol.. i'm any where from 30 to 45 between", "I had that issue until I found out I had thyroid issues. After beginning thyroid meds, my schedule is back to normal.", "Not to mention she told him she wasn't riding and he should leave.  I don't get these people boo hooing about leaving a girl at three a.m.  Leaving a guy is fine then?  All of a sudden these \"girls\" are helpless?  F that.  She said leave her, he left.  That's respecting her agency.  The fact that she called ten minutes later pissed he did what she told him to do just shows she was playing emotional games trying to guilt him into obedience.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  Nope, I left at your direction and I'm not going back.  If he doesn't dump her, I bet she never offers that bluff again.  LOL", "Mmm.... maybe not on my day 2 bit otherwise.", "I'm saying you have a fundamental misunderstanding of their comment. A bicycle is a personal vehicle with expensive often-leather seats. That is what OP is posting about. The other user, a woman, does not have a bicycle. She projected the experience onto her equivalent frame of reference, a personal vehicle with expensive seats. \n\nIt's a way humans use to relate to experiences, often referred to as analogy.", "My period is weird. First couple days flow is so low that it's barely noticeable at all. But after the first couple/few days it's a sudden Niagara Falls down there. \n\nBasically I have 2 \"starts\" to my period and neither is particularly regular. First start is too light for anything but liners to be comfortable. Second start is *way* too heavy for anything but cup with near hourly empties and super heavy flow period underwear. \nI have definitely been surprised by that second start and there is absolutely no way any of those options would work for a 10 minute drive straddling a bike seat.  \n\nI have done the folded toilet paper solution and it takes practically 1/2 a roll to get a thickness that is gonna last more than 5 minutes. (And it feels disgusting and painful to sit on)", "all I am saying is that comparing someone that has a broken limb to someone who could be murdered is not as bad a comparison as one might think, I think both were very immature and should have talked it out and he should have either walked her home, or he could have slow rode the bike along side her and made sure she got home safely."]}
