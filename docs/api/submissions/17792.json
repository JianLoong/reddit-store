She tells me her periods are early and so my bike seat might get messy.\n\nShe's done this before without telling me she's bleeding and she recommends I don't need to clean the seat, just leave it in the sun for a while. I find this disgusting.\n\nSo I tell her now, place a couple of paper sheets on the bike seat and sit on it. She refuses. She doesn't want to be humiliated in front of other friends. I say we let them go first and leave later, since 3 in the morning there will be no one on the street.\n\nShe starts shouting at me and asking me to leave so I grab my keys and head out.. Since her room is quite close, approx a mile, I figure even if she walks she'll be fine. She's standing out, near the gate and asked me to leave (on the bike), she'll leave on her own, so I leave.\n\nNow (10 mins after leaving her) she phones me calls me a psycho.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:\nOkay, I'll shed some light: \n\n1. This is Bangalore, India. We don't do cars at 23. Well, not most of us anyway. We were hanging out because the campus is great and they have night canteen till 3 am.\n\n2. She's been backing out of the relationship because of the age difference, she's sure she won't get her parents approval.\n\n3  We were on our 24 hour grad school campus, but stay in a room outside campus. She thinks the sanitary pads the college provides is a size small for her so says it won't help even a bit. Same about the paper btw. She won't explain why but knows they won't help at all.\n\n4.

I am female and I work in healthcare, blood definitely must be cleaned immediately. Who knows what diseases are laying in wait? Lo", "I always have an emergency pad or tampon in my bag, in all the different bags I potentially use in fact, I thought that was just a normal part of being someone with a uterus past the age of a out 10 but now I'm wondering if I'm the odd one. How hard is it to shove a tampon in your handbag or wallet so you don't get caught out?!", "No. Ww women are adults. It is incredibly patronizing and condescending to insist on walking us when we told the dude that go away.", "Was there a smell afterwards?", "Bra? How is that a solution?", "A bra??  Absolutely not.  They are entirely too expensive to ruin by shoving one down my underwear just bc my period started.", "I've been reading comments about whether or not this could stop the seat from getting stained, and everyone seems to be missing the point. She didn't even try, that's the problem. I agree with you. Even if it could stop a little bit, even if nothing at all, that could have been a nice try for me, but the girl didn't even try. Imagine saying \"oh no that wouldn't completely stop it, so I'm not going to do anything about it and will let your seat get stained \ud83d\ude42\"", "NO!!  Literally none. Haha I was amazed.", "Same here. I have tampons in the pocket of every coat, and always have them in my bag as well.", "Wasn't it a 4chan psyop to see just how silly they could make feminists look?", "\"Typical 28 day cycle\" is a myth.", "Every day, I learn something new\u2026", "Right? Go to the toilets and shove some toilet paper down there and you're good to go. If blood's getting all over the seat, it would also be soaking through her underwear and getting all over her clothes. Who wants that?", "I would've been fine going through life not knowing this. \ud83d\ude2c", "This is not something you find in South Asian cultures where the tendency is to be discreet about your periods and to not discuss them with guys you don't know well. Wearing dark clothes to cover up \" accidents\" is common. No one wants to walk the streets or catch a bus with a giant red stain on your crotch. Dunno why OP' s gf has a thing about bleeding on his bike. Control maybe", "It seems very inconsiderate because blood is not easy to get out of fabrics and it\u2019s not like people go around asking females if they are free bleeders???\n\nI would be so upset if my friend sat on my couch and bled all over it or smth. \n\nESH though, leaving her at 3am can be dangerous.", "Yet, it is illegal to be a \u201cfree urinator\u201d or \u201cfree defector\u201d? I and before anyone says \u201cyou can\u2019t hold in period blood like you cane pee or poop\u201d, take a look at the number of incontinence products there are in stores that are made for active lifestyles.", "Why would free bleeding smell gross?", "Toilets in India don\u2019t have toilet paper", "You didn't really read the comment, did you? They were saying how all flows are normal, even though some of us might not be used to them. They were saying how some heavy flows can go through pads and clothes and anything, because some people seem to think that's not possible. No one used this as an example to excuse someone not having supplies ready. It was just a reply to some of the people here that seem to think that periods can't be that heavy.", "I like sharing the awful things people do. Shared trauma brings us closer, it's how I make all my friends. We're friends now \ud83d\ude03. Want to cry about it over ice-cream and wine?", "I never said I agree with this. Most people don't? \ud83d\ude36", "Because period blood smells different than normal blood and *old* period blood is rank."]}
