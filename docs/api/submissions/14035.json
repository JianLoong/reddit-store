The key difference between what he did and what you did was that he got frustrated over something he has no right to expect -- dinner served by someone else's labor but to his liking -- whereas you got frustrated over something that you *did* have a right to expect: civilized treatment and appreciation for your extra effort on his behalf.", "NTA\n\nYou both work, he is not able to come home at dinner time.\n\nYou should not be expected to cook dinner twice each night", "Wait am I reading this right\u2026 the in-laws live there and didn\u2019t cook? Are they disabled and unable to care for themselves?There\u2019s a nanny there so they aren\u2019t helping with the kids so what\u2019s going on? The dynamics doesn\u2019t sound right to me.\n\nI think husband and wife are both stressed and frustrated with work and home life and took the stress out on each other. Sounds like things need to be reevaluated in this household but without more info we really don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.. I don\u2019t really think the food was the issue here personally. I maybe wrong", "NTA - You have a really long day after work, how are you not completely exhausted?\n\nIf he doesn't like what the meal is, he can cook for himself. What's he contributing exactly?\n\nAlso, maybe look into more meals you can twice during the week so you don't have to cook every day - like lasagne or casseroles, curry. Maybe even make a couple on Sunday for the week.", "NTA. Vacuuming while you carry the majority of DAILY household needs and take on the mental load is not 50/50.

Because this is a little confusing. Does the nanny live with you? The in-laws do live with you so can they contribute to anything or are they unable to for whatever reason? How many people are you taking care of/cooking for when you get home from work?\n\nIf the in laws are able to help and just don't then you should have a talk with them. But if the reason they're living with you is that they need taken care of too then you need to figure something out because taking care of 2 kids is hard enough, let alone taking care of 2 adults on top of that.\n\nEither way you're NTA but you need to re-evaluate this family dynamic because it really sounds like your family expects you to do all the hard work of a SAHM even though you got a job.", "NTA. Men lack the level of empathy that we have. Not trying to excuse his behavior but I see this same story played out in so many relationships. Husband hardly bears the household burden like his wife but expects things to turn out in his favor. My advice: stop cooking his dinner and suggest he do it to ensure that it\u2019s up to his \u201cstandards\u201d..if that\u2019s not going to be an option for him request that he acknowledge his disgusting behavior\u2026if that\u2019s not going to be an option then tell him to suck your big toe.
