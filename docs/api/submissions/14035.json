In the last 2 years of my marriage,  I would cook for her and I. More often than not, she ate something else. I stopped giving a damn about it because now I had lunch the next day", "This is so, so right. OP needs to not cook for him anymore. He was a jerk and is acting like a victim. Classic DARVO move, so I hope this is rare.", "This^", "NTA", "And didn't answer the phone when she tried to ask him NTA op", "The nanny doesn\u2019t live with us. She leaves at 6:30 when I get back. My in laws do live with us and are overall healthy. When my fil came to live with us he had an injury and could not help. We got him treatment and he is doing much better. So he helps out now with some of the household work but does not generally do the cooking. My mil is generally healthy but has been sick the last few weeks so she has not been up to doing much recently. Even when she is healthy though if she cooks I generally need to plan and ask her to prepare something. I should ask for help more but I will admit I\u2019m not great at asking for help so will often just do it myself. \n\nTo clarify though, I was not upset that the cooking fell to me or even that the household tasks were unevenly distributed. I am more upset that there is no appreciation from him. So big picture my days are much longer than my husband. I still do any middle of the night or early morning wake up from our youngest. And I do the mornings with the kids (with the help of nanny when she arrives). But I figure out school lunch and get my school aged child to school while the nanny helps with the youngest. My husband starts later than I do and tends to sleep in. So for example by 9 am today I had done all the morning routine and was at work and my husband was just waking up for the day. I have explained to my husband in the past that I understand he is a person who doesn\u2019t function well on less sleep and that I have the capacity to do more, so I am happy to do the mornings but just can\u2019t deal with the complaining. I feel like if he wants things done perfectly or a certain way he needs to step up and do it,  otherwise he should just be grateful that I take on the majority and say nothing when things are not perfect. \n\nThat was a very long response I gave but thank you for your earlier response and request for info. Hopefully that gives a bit of a better picture on my insight.", "Couples fight and disagree about division of labor in mature relationships all the time. Just FYI.", "Exactly", "This isn\u2019t ok.
