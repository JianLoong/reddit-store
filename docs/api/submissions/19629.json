No one takes my Reese's", "NTA, however i think dude might be flirting with you also using that as a gateway to open the talks. Also, 20 years ago i bought a pizza for lunch when i worked at ATT, and this one girl asked for a slice, i didnt want to share. so i told her, she offered me 3 dollars for the slice. I gave her a slice and when she went to lunch she was supposed to bring me the money back. she stiffed me, so after that going forward if someone asks for some of what im eating i tell them 20 dollars. when they say they can buy their own at that point, i tell them do it... i wasnt selling anyway, you just kept being annoying. follow my advice", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
