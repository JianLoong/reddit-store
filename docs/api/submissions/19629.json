I gave her a slice and when she went to lunch she was supposed to bring me the money back. she stiffed me, so after that going forward if someone asks for some of what im eating i tell them 20 dollars. when they say they can buy their own at that point, i tell them do it... i wasnt selling anyway, you just kept being annoying. follow my advice", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just something to think about", "And for future reference - asking repeatedly when you've already told them no is rude, no matter how politely they are speaking.", "I\u2019ve never understood homeless shelters in the states. I\u2019m in Canada and on a little island named Newfoundland. Our homeless shelters are like a little houses. Everyone gets their own room. And you can eat whatever you want to eat. And you can bring it in to eat. Yes, the homeless shelters are full, they have emergency housing. That\u2019s a private persons home, usually one with a basement apartment that has a door from the main house there. And once again, everyone gets their own rooms and they still bring you three meals and snacks and you can bring whatever you want in.\n\nWhen I went to the shelter for battered women and children, I had a TV in my room, my own private bathroom. That place was the best place I was ever. They went out of their way to help me. They have a set of five apartments attached to the back of the shelter, these bedsitter like places, and they let you live there for up to three years. And while you\u2019re there, they help you get everything you need.\n\nI ended up switching up to the [Woman Centre](https://sjwomenscentre.ca) and they put me off in one of their bachelor apartments. These women would help us with everything. You needed your taxes done they were someone there who would take it and just do your taxes. You\u2019re cracked your tooth and you don\u2019t know what to do. They fix that.\n\nI hate that not all shelters in the world are like this", "That's crazy! Trust your gut", "Not all shelters in Canada are like that! Yours sounds like a longer term women's housing situation.  But if you go in a temp shelter that you have to check into daily, first come first served, in a city, you are all in 1 big room.", "NTA", "No is a complete sentence.", "NAH. Both of you are exhibiting the behavior for someone who\u2019s experienced food scarcity. He\u2019s being annoying and you\u2019re good to shut him down, but it\u2019s also something you\u2019re going to experience a lot of in a shelter environment. Hiding the wrapper might be a courteous and tactful move.", "NTA. You aren't obligated to share your food with a stranger, even if you've said hi a few times", "I totally agree. I'm also homeless right now, and the small joys are literally lifesaving. I also have food allergies, so if I'm able to get a treat that I can actually have, it boosts my mood so much. plus, this was also the only food she had for the day and she needs the calories. the guy was way too pushy. I never ask anyone else for anything, it's always a trade or barter if I do want/need something. there are definitely rude ass, greedy people that will demand stuff though- like a guy flipping out at my dad recently because he refused for the umpteenth time to buy this practical stranger some beer. if we had money to support someone's alcohol habit, we'd be spending it on necessities! OP should feel no guilt about keeping her stuff, and should get used to declining demands. it won't be the last time, at least from my experience. living on the streets you can run into wicked selfish, entitled people.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry that all of you are in that situation, but at no point should you feel like you have to share the one little thing that gives you joy. He was rude for insisting. You said no. End of story.", "NTA. \nMany shelter users will pressure others for things they want and if that doesn\u2019t work, may steal them.

He may be doing this to other people in the shelter and could escalate.", "It\u2019s funny I got down voted for basically saying don\u2019t share.

It's def tough out here and while being on the street isn't new to me, staying at a shelter is. I'm mad at the world rn too cause we were homeless for so long we got into a housing program last year. So we literally have an apt but we tried to help an ex friend and it went south so we can't safely stay there. Just waiting for paperwork to be done so we can move", "What's the expression that comes to mind? Oh yeah... Silence speaks volumes", "That sounds awesome. That's very similar to the housing program we've been in since last year. They put us in a hotel until an apartment opened up. We're only in the shelter for a safety issue while they find a new apartment for us so this won't be too long. But yeah the shelters here are tough. There are other ones that are indoors but we couldn't have our pets with us there and I'd die before I left them", "Yes the walkie talkie thing weirded me out so I did tell them about that", "Lol yeah I was confused by the downvotes. He does cause he's seen us together and will ask if I'm talking to my bf instead of using his name when he wants the walkie talkie."]}
