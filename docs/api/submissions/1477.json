It\u2019s about a 5 hour drive to get to one another. \nAnywho, he calls me after work, and says that he found a bird that he *thinks* is a baby pigeon with no feathers, no ability to fly, and sick looking. He hangs up after telling me this and I immediately call back. I ask him his plans with said bird and he responds with \u201cim keeping it.\u201d i ask what he plans on doing with it this weekend while he\u2019s visiting and he mentions that it\u2019s just gonna \u201changout\u201d with us. I tell him that i can respect and appreciate that he wants to help the bird but that it would not be coming inside the house. I live with my aunt who has a cat with a high prey drive and my cat also has a high prey drive. I mention that i am not comfortable with having a bird in the house with a cat, especially a wild bird that looks sick. He brushes this off by saying \u201cit\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I tell him that the bird is not coming into my aunts house (who i live with and know would also not want the bird in here) and that if he really wanted to keep the bird it was best that he leave it with a friend while he visits. He calls me later while on the road and reveals that he still has the bird and will just keep it in his car for the weekend. I am against this plan also because while i don\u2019t want the bird inside, i don\u2019t want it to suffer either. i live somewhere very cold and the bird would not survive the night in the cold. We end the conversation with him saying that im being unreasonable and we could just put the cats up for the weekend. I am not willing to do this as the cats live her and shouldn\u2019t have to change their behavior. I explain that i also don\u2019t want the cats to get anything from the bird since we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually sick or not and i also advise him that i am also not comfortable with knowing that the bird could potentially be sick.

Make it a little newspaper nest that helps keep its body warmth in and insulate from the cold?\n\nKinda same reason it's better to sleep in your car than on the street, I suppose.\n\nI mean, on the other hand, pigeons are the rats of the sky, so if it is in fact a pigeon I'm not personally super invested in handling or saving it, but your bf obviously sees that differently.", "Are you in the US?", "okay those are all good points.", "yes!", "Maybe he would at least be willing to call a wildlife hotline. 972-234-9453 is the Dallas/Fort Worth Wildlife Coalition hotline. Open 7 am - 10 pm Central Time every day and they take calls from all over the country. They can help him take proper care of the bird."]}
