{"id": 7536, "submission_id": "10dxpwa", "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay what my ex owes on a car lost due to DUI?", "selftext": "So my (29M) ex Amelia (29F) and I broke up a few years ago.  Before we broke up, she co-signed on a car for me (I had a well-paying job but bad credit).  Shortly after we broke up I got a DUI and the car was impounded.  Amelia needed to be there to get it out of impound since my drivers license was taken away from the DUI - they would not release it to me even if my friend drove it home.  Amelia lives in another city and said she was unable to come to the impound lot even though I asked her several times, I think she was just avoiding me.  After 30 days the car was sold at auction.  Fast forward to now, the dealership has come after her for what was left on the loan, about $6,000 total.  Her wages are being garnished and she owes about $2,000 more at this time.  She thinks I should pay for it, but I think it\u2019s her fault since she refused to come and help me get it out of impound.  I recently told my current gf about this and she thinks I should pay back all $6,000 (Amelia is only asking me to help with the final $2,000), and that Amelia could probably take me to small claims court for the whole $6,000.  \n\nI already posted this to legaladvice, but I came here for a moral judgment.
