I knocked on the door and the guy answered. I explained who i was and before I got another word out he said, \"I didn't steal no package.\" At that point I hadn't even said anything about a package. So I just nod and ask if he saw anything or if his camera did. He shook his head, \"That camera ain't work, just for show.\" So I left and chalked it up to a mistake or something. We got our money back from Amazon and ordered again, and had it shipped to my mom's house. \n\nWe decided to do that until my girlfriend's daughter accidentally had a package sent to the house. I watched the tracking like a hawk, and as so as I saw delivered I broke my neck to get to the porch, no package was there. I was frustrated, I raked away and kicked one of the house's trash cans. I had a guess and looked into the trash for the package, maybe the delivery driver put it in the trash. \n\nWhile I was looking, the guy came out and said, \"Oh, you looking for another package?\" I close the lid. And he literally said. \"I didn't take this one either.\" I just almost lost it. I went back to the apartment and almost cried from anger. \n\nThe next day, the town's Facebook page was going crazy, someone had stolen an autistic kid's bike from in from of the local diner. \nThe kid is well know around town, so every ship and business checked their cameras, and caught the bastard. It was the guy who lives above me. The one who \"didn't\" steal my packages. \n\nSo that brings up to yesterday, when I accidentally shipped something to the house, I didn't know that PayPal changes the shipping address. I went up there and waited for the package.

He threw a fit and told me to get off his porch. \n\nI lost it, all the anger boiled up and came out. I called him a useless piece of shit. That he was the worst human being in town. I was so angry all my words came out in loud shrill screams. \n\nHe just said he \"didn't steal nothing\" over and over.\n\nThen I went back to the basement, feeling embarrassed, AITA for screaming at him.", "created_utc": 1687179654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14de1rs/aita_for_getting_mad_once_i_found_out_my_package/", "score": 1178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's 'no reason' to you?", "Yeah, I don't know why people here expect the cops to just jump at any opportunity to do anything. Most places they don't care for anything short of armed robbery and sometimes even _then_.", "But, it\u2019s his own porch. I don\u2019t know, maybe I give criminals too much credit, but if he\u2019s stealing for any reason other than it\u2019s a compulsion, he\u2019s incredibly stupid.", "Well. It wasn't two. It was more like 5. \n\nAnd I had no proof you can say all you want but without proof it's, \"he said she said,\"\n\nAnd the cameras showed proof he took the bike and nothing happened to him. \n\nSo yes, no reason.", "This is the same guy who actively put himself in OP's crosshairs by preemptively saying he didn't steal a package. If he literally just stayed inside, all OP could have done is look around the barren complex and seethed. It's pretty obvious from the start that the guy is a few cards short of a full deck.", "Well it\u2019s an apartment complex so unless he owns the building it\u2019s a community porch. \n\nBut hopefully op takes this as the wake up call the landlord and work something out.", ">And the cameras showed proof he took the bike and nothing happened to him. \n\nBystander Effect. I'd recommend looking it up.\n\n5 packages went missing? You didn't decide to call the police out, tell them about the insanely suspect statements your neighbor made and point out that he was previously caught stealing a bike? Does he have an industrial shredder in his apartment that would allow him to completely destroy the shipping box? Ignoring all that, the police knocking on his door could very easily have been the warning needed to keep him from doing anything with at least your packages in the future.", "NTA", "Um, fun fact, but someone taking someone else's mail is mail theft and a FEDERAL FREAKING OFFENSE. \n\nHere's a link to the webpage to start a report.  [https://www.uspis.gov/report](https://www.uspis.gov/report) In my experience the Postal Inspectors do not eff around.  This dude needs to be stopped. Hard. \n\nNTA.  I'm just glad he didn't get physical with you. People like that are not stable.", "Nta. I would def invest in a camera (we got a ring cheap). They are so nice. Not just for deliveries, but if someone comes to the door, you hear a noise, your away from home & want to make sure things are ok, etc. They also help if you catch him & want to press charges.", "Unless it\u2019s an obvious rom com plot.", "Look up Mark Rober Glitter Bomb Porch Pirates packages\n\nRepeat process\n\nPost on petty revenge", "It\u2019s best to avoid public displays of rage. Just report your suspicions and continue getting items shipped elsewhere.", "That's probably because the police don't follow leads from Facebook!", "Calling the police to report theft is literally the right thing to do. You have to have a police report to get stolen items covered by your credit card company, however\u2026 one of my neighbors stole packages from my entire community. She was arrested because we all had police reports filed and they found our stolen property in her home.", "Maybe you should contact that youtube guy with his glitter and fart spray packages he uses for porch theives.", "You need a damn camera yourself"]}
