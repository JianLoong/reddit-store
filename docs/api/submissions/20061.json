{"id": 20061, "submission_id": "14de1rs", "title": "AITA for Getting Mad Once I Found Out My Package Was Stolen, Again?", "selftext": "So about 6 months ago we moved into a new apartment. It's a house with three apartments in it. Two on one floor, and one basement. We're in the basement and there is guy in the middle, no one else. \n\nWe ordered some curtains and stuff from Amazon and had it shipped to the house. \n\nSo the day of delivery came and I ran up to the porch, and I couldn't find the packages. I knocked on the door and the guy answered. I explained who i was and before I got another word out he said, \"I didn't steal no package.\" At that point I hadn't even said anything about a package. So I just nod and ask if he saw anything or if his camera did. He shook his head, \"That camera ain't work, just for show.\" So I left and chalked it up to a mistake or something. We got our money back from Amazon and ordered again, and had it shipped to my mom's house. \n\nWe decided to do that until my girlfriend's daughter accidentally had a package sent to the house. I watched the tracking like a hawk, and as so as I saw delivered I broke my neck to get to the porch, no package was there. I was frustrated, I raked away and kicked one of the house's trash cans. I had a guess and looked into the trash for the package, maybe the delivery driver put it in the trash. \n\nWhile I was looking, the guy came out and said, \"Oh, you looking for another package?\" I close the lid. And he literally said. \"I didn't take this one either.\" I just almost lost it. I went back to the apartment and almost cried from anger. \n\nThe next day, the town's Facebook page was going crazy, someone had stolen an autistic kid's bike from in from of the local diner. \nThe kid is well know around town, so every ship and business checked their cameras, and caught the bastard. It was the guy who lives above me. The one who \"didn't\" steal my packages. \n\nSo that brings up to yesterday, when I accidentally shipped something to the house, I didn't know that PayPal changes the shipping address. I went up there and waited for the package. He comes out and stares at me. \"What are you doing?'\n\n\"Waiting for a package, since I can't trust anyone on this street.\" I said. \n\n\"Well I didn't steal your packages.\"\n\n\"Just like you didn't steal a bike.\" I muttered to myself. He threw a fit and told me to get off his porch. \n\nI lost it, all the anger boiled up and came out. I called him a useless piece of shit. That he was the worst human being in town. I was so angry all my words came out in loud shrill screams. \n\nHe just said he \"didn't steal nothing\" over and over.\n\nThen I went back to the basement, feeling embarrassed, AITA for screaming at him.", "created_utc": 1687179654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14de1rs/aita_for_getting_mad_once_i_found_out_my_package/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
