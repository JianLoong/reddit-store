I told her to don't even think about excluding my child and if she ever does that then the wedding will be canceled. I told her that my child will always come first and if she wants to be flower girl she will be the flower girl whether my fiancee likes it or not.\n\nshe was looking at me bewildered the whole time and then she started to yell at me asking me wtf is wrong with me and telling me to let her finish her fcking sentence. apparently she thinks my daughter is too old to be flower girl which is why she wanted to make her a junior bridesmaid instead.\n\nI tried to apologize but she didn't listen to me and just left.

I am going to assume that your fianc\u00e9e excluding your daughter has not been a problem in the past, based off of her response to your outburst, and the fact that you proposed to her, so I\u2019m a little confused why you think she would start doing that now.", "YTA. I hope she cancel the wedding.", "YTA\n\nShe didn't turn it into a fight, you started the fight. She just matched you energy.

YTA", "YTA\n\nAnd get some anger management mate. \n\nYou couldn't let her finish before you lost your shit for absolutely nothing. \n\nShe wants your daughter in a more important role then flowergirl. \n\nI would hate to see how you parent and act as a partner usually, if you won't let people finish before going ballistic, this is a huge red flag she needs to look at, and one you need to also look at and fix.", "YTA\n\nShe's not overreacting. You exploded on her for no reason, instead of talking it over. You even talked about cancelling the wedding without talking it over.\n\nYou're a big AH", "YTA \n\nThat's a HUGE assumption to make about someone you proposed to. I don't understand why you would wanna marry her if you don't trust her to love and include your daughter.", "YTA - yeah I think you jumped to conclusions here.\n\nI enjoy this sub but it definitely has everyone convinced step parents are evil, in-laws are horrible, and you should go NC with EVERYONE.", "YTA. What an overreaction you had to her suggesting someone else", "YTA. How the heck is she supposed to calmly explain something to you when you didn't even give her a chance to finish her sentence! You jumped to conclusions and showed you don't trust her at all. I would be surprised if there is a wedding now given you think so low of her", "YTA - jfc who lets Reddit influence their real life? This sun jumps to extremes all the time. \n\nThat you didn't even let her finish and interrupted her says a lot. I wouldn't marry you if you behaved like that. That's not protecting your daughter that's just being a dick and assuming your fianc\u00e9e is horrible for no reason other than some stupid internet posts", "YTA. Why would you base your opinion on stuff you read on Reddit rather than your real-life experience with your fiancee. You owe her a bunch more unqualified apologies and you'd better hope she's even willing to hear them.", "YTA, you jumped to conclusions and threatened to call off the wedding without taking even a minute to listen to her? You need to apologize. She didn\u2019t turn it into a fight you did.", "YTA - You can't really disagree with her here.  You didn't hear her out and instead made up your mind and formulated your response on incomplete information.  She's right to be pissed at you.", "YTA. Unless your fianc\u00e9e has actually said or done anything to make you think she'd be an \"evil stepmom,\" it's crazy unfair to project that anxiety on her. You're the one who made it a huge fight, you lashed out at her for no reason.", "YTA.  You fucked up big time.  This showed a complete lack of trust in your fianc\u00e9 (who is right, 11 is way too old for a flower girl).  Apologize profusely.  Figure out what in the hell made you think this, really, because it wasn\u2019t Reddit.  There\u2019s a reason you latched on to this particular worry.", "YTA. Total a.

Ok but I\u2019m your quest to be the \u201cgood dad\u201d\u2026you became the crappy husband.", "Are you kidding? YTA.", "YTA, you went from 0 to 100 in a split second and didn't even let your fiance finish her sentence. If you are going to marry her, you should have a lot more confidence in her. Please, really put in an effort to make up with her", "YTA. You turned it into a fight, not her.", "YTA\n\nWell\u2026 you got yourself in quite a pickle didn\u2019t you. LOL.", "YTA.  Oh YOU turned it into a fight.  You jumped in with both feet and mouth running.  She couldn't calmly explain it because you didn't give her a chance.", "YTA. You went from 0 to 100 before you even had a chance to hear her out.", "YTA. You lurk on AITA, read (probably fake) stories about strangers in the internet, get worked up about your future wife (who you know PERSONALLY and supposedly love), and then lose your absolute shit on her? Has she ever exhibited any exclusionary behaviour in the past towards your daughter? Do you have any FACTUAL or REAL basis for this fear other than garbage you\u2019ve read on Reddit? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s second guessing marrying your anger management-needing ass.", "YTA. By your own account you \"lost it\" before giving her a chance to expand on her initial statement. If her statement had indeed ended with a refusal, the normal follow-up response would have been \"Oh. Why not?\" You basically threw a completely unnecessary tantrum at your future partner and will certainly not do your daughter any favors if you react this way at every obstacle in her path.", "YTA. Yes, this website is full of stories about horrible stepmothers, but that doesn't mean that your fianc\u00e9e will be one. You're projecting what you've read on her and that's not ok.\n\nShe tried to explain to you, but you wouldn't let her talk. So that argument of yours is moot. She was probably shocked at hearing the crap that was coming out of your mouth. \n\nTo be fair, prepare yourself for the eventuality that you two might break up. She got a glimpse of something she hasn't seen before, and her faith in your relationship might be shaken.", "YTA\n\n At 11 it was pretty obvious she is too old to be a flower girl. \n\n \n>if she ever does that then the wedding will be canceled.\n\n Please cancel it. She deserves someone who doesn't treat her like this. I would dump you so hard after this. I mean, hypothetically speaking, cause i'll never get with a man with baggage, but you get the point. \n\n Also, this sub hates stepmothers no matter what they do, so you might want to look for a more reputable source of information on stepmothers.", "YTA First, for blowing up. Second, for not letting your fiance finish. Third, for assuming including your daughter is her job. If it's important to you that your daughter is included have her be a groomswoman.", "YTA\n\n\"All I did was blow up and scream at her, why couldn't she calmly just talk to me?\" \n\nDo you hear yourself? You'll be lucky to have a fiance after talking to her like that.", "YTA you are the one who start fighting . You are the one who don't allow her to finish taking why blame her you should blame yourself.", "YTA.\n\n\"she WILL BE the flower girl whether my fiancee LIKES IT OR NOT\"\n\nYOU turned it into a fight the moment YOU made a demand. You didn't communicate anything, you made a demand and she react accordingly. \n\nWhy should she calmly explain anything when you provoked her with a demand out of the blue as your tone just by reading it is judgmental and aggressive. \n\nIt's like saying you didn't throw the first punch, you just shoved the guy who took a swing at ya. All did was verbally shoved her out of the blue.", "YTA. 11 is a bit old for a flower girl, and bridesmaid is as big a deal (if not bigger). My stepdaughter was this age when I first got married and never even thought of making her flower girl, would have been a bit weird.", "YTA - I understand your concern that you didn't want to have your daughter excluded, and I slightly get being concerned she might turn into a villainous step-mother. However, you apparently cut her off mid-sentence to fuss her out. Then when she yells back and leaves you are all \\* shocked Pikachu faced\\* and turned it on her saying couldn't she calmly explain instead of turning it into a fight. See that end part right there made you the asshole to me. Couldn't you have been calmer and let her finish her sentence before berating her? Your reaction was the reason for her reaction and you are blaming everything on her. And she is right btw that's too old to be a flower girl and her suggestion (had you let her get there) would have been a more appropriate role. You owe her an apology.", "Yta.   This is what happens when you assume.", "I\u2019m sorry, but the irony of you thinking SHE overreacted is just too much. \n\nYTA. Grovel and never ever do that again. In fact, do some mental health work if you are this quick to jump on the person you love instead of just asking them to clarify", "I think you are the one who turned this into a fight! Start groveling or grieving cause dude YTA", "YTA\n\nYou read some posts about toxic women on reddit and then decided that the woman you are marrying, the one you have known for literal years, the one you know loves your daughter, suddenly must be just like them? \n\nThere are a couple of things here:\n\n1. You are a misogynistic jerk to read something about a complete stranger and apply it to your partner simply because they were both women. \n\n2. You are emotionally abusive. You freaked out at your fiance, gave implied threats, and said that things were going to go YOUR way at a wedding for both of you... because she didn't agree with something you said? If you blow up at people for disagreeing with you, you should be spending money on therapy, not a wedding. Normal people simply ask why the other person has a different opinion. \n\nIt sounds like you read a story, had some feelings, decided your feelings were reality, and forced the situation to validate said feelings. \n\nYTA and your fiance should call things off until you take some accountability and get some therapy in. That is such a huge red flag for future abuse. Not to mention you saying stuff like that could poison her relationship with her future daughter. If I felt the person I was marrying would use the child to manipulate me or guilt me, I would be sad to lose the child, but ultimately I would be protecting myself and the child to end things immediately. \n\nYTA, in case I wasn't clear.", "YTA - you by your own admission cut her off as she was going to tell her your thoughts and \u201clost it.\u201d I\u2019m guessing really means you started yelling at her about your daughter and how much you care and the only way she could get you to stop was to yell at you to break your ranting. She likely didn\u2019t accept the apology/left because in her mind she\u2019s now thinking about the next time this happens and how it will escalate further any time you don\u2019t listen and immediately react.\n\nETA - don\u2019t try using lurking on Reddit as an excuse for your poor behavior, it\u2019s not a good look or valid", "YTA. \n\nAnd you aren't ready to get married.", "Dude, you made it a fight. Don\u2019t blame her for that. YTA", "You\u2019re the one that turned it in to a fight!\n\nYTA!", "YTA and you definitely need to  work on your communication skills.

Appalling behaviour", "YTA  stop winding yourself up reading about the crazy step parents and be happy you have one of the good ones.\n\n\nGo get her some flowers and apologise.", "YTA. Using this site as a reason for your \u201cworry\u201d that your future wife would turn into an evil stepmom is pretty lame. You asked her something, didn\u2019t let her completely before shouting at her, threatening to end the relationship. That was your FIRST go to. If she is smart, she won\u2019t marry you.

(Reading Reddit is not a reason). Has she treated your daughter poorly? Has she excluded her from important events in the past?\n\nUnless you have some really concrete examples of your fianc\u00e9e treating your daughter poorly, you have no leg to stand on.

It would be fitting for your fiance to post this so you could be called an asshole twice.", "YTA.\n\nOf course your daughter shouldn\u2018t get excluded. But seriously, you were talking with the woman you want to MARRY, you should be at a stage of your relationship where you trust her enough not to be a shitty stepmother and at least let her finish explaining her thoughts.

The key for me is \"let her finish her fucking sentence\". Sounds like you cut her off mid sentence when you exploded, so she didn't have a chance to \"calmly explain\".

I told her to don't even think about excluding my child and if she ever does that then the wedding will be canceled. I told her that my child will always come first and if she wants to be flower girl she will be the flower girl whether my fiancee likes it or not.\n\nshe was looking at me bewildered the whole time and then she started to yell at me asking me wtf is wrong with me and telling me to let her finish her fcking sentence. apparently she thinks my daughter is too old to be flower girl which is why she wanted to make her a junior bridesmaid instead.\n\nI tried to apologize but she didn't listen to me and just left. I know I overreacted but I was just trying to be a good dad and I think she was overreacting too couldn't she just calmly explain this to me instead of turning it into a fight?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She had it handled but you assumed she didn\u2019t. Who do you want to be for her in this marriage?\n\nYTA", "Dude, why are you guys yelling. Just talk.", "YTA. \n\nDamn dude, is flying off the handle over nothing a regular occurrence in your life? Get it together.", "\\> in my defense I have been in reddit and this sub for a long time\n\ntranslation: I judged my fiance based off of unrelated stories I read on the internet, instead of, I don't know, the person who I have (hopefully) gotten to know over some period of time. This isn't a \"defence\", it's an \"excuse\", and a ludicrously stupid one at that. \n\nPlus the fact that she didn't even *finish her sentence* before you \"lost it\".\n\nYTA, you're incredibly immature, and if reddit posts are enough to cause you to flip out before someone even finished their sentence, the best thing you can do is log off until you're ready to be a big boy. I think you're getting to regret putting calling off the wedding on the table in your outburst.", "Yta. Way to overreact to the max", "YTA\n\nYou interrupted, to overreact to what you THOUGHT she was saying, not only unfinished but unclarified.\n\nHer response was totally proportional.\n\nAnd yeah, it's not reddit's fault. If hearing stories about the worst of humanity makes you see a-holes everywhere,  you're cut off. Go watch Pixar.", "Fake", "Yta, get tf off of Reddit if it makes you jump to conclusions and \u201close it\u201d that mf quickly", "I love the multiverse of hypocrisy here. OP's is obvious... thinking she's overreacting, but not for a minute thinking about his hysterical overreaction to her incomplete, perfectly normal statements.\n\nBut all the comments here, feigning shock and horror that a guy would go after a soon-to-be stepmother like this... as if his verbal attack wouldn't be *the exact advice, in the exact tone, that everyone here would be insisting on*.\n\nI mean, have folks *seen* how stepparents are treated here?\n\nImagine if he had just stopped his narrative with stepmom saying \"I don't think she should be a flower girl.\" What to you think commentariat would be saying?\n\nAnd man alive, the dogpile treating him like he's History's Greatest Monster for acting out like this, and stupid for taking advice *routinely given out every day of the week on here*.\n\nHe's responsible for his actions, but... wow. I half believe this is all an elaborate ruse to hold up a mirror to how toxic this place can get.", "YTA. You went 0 to 100 real quick. Are you sure you\u2019re ready for marriage? There will be a lot more disagreements in a marriage. If your go to reaction is to freak out anytime your fiance has a different opinion before she can even elaborate on her opinion, well, I hope one of you rethinks this marriage. Do you go to therapy at all if this is a common reaction?", "YTA. why would she be calm when you weren't?", "YTA. You made the assumption, she's also fully aware your child comes first, and it's so obnoxious to need to constantly state that.", "YTA. She didn't turn it into anything. You started a fight by assuming she was going to be a wicked stepmother (which I'm sure she found delightful of you btw). She simply told you where you could shove it", "YTA - this was unhinged. The flower girl role is usually meant for little girls, not a kid in middle school. It seems like you were waiting for literally any reason to pounce on your poor future wife. Jesus H, get therapy and pray you didn't ruin your relationship.", "This can't be real, you've pinpointed the issue so perfectly, the whole perspective of the story sympathizes with her and it ends on an actual cliffhanger.

You didn't give her a chance to explain before you jumped all over her.", ">And don't blame Reddit for your behavior.

He didn\u2019t do this. Reddit did! /s\n\nSeriously, though. The lack of emotional control is scary. People who lack emotional control to this extent can quickly turn abusive, and if I were friends with the fianc\u00e9e, I\u2019d be telling her to RUN and never look back. \n\nIt\u2019s not even just the escalation. It\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s still trying to find some way to put blame on her for this situation. \n\nWhy should he be afforded the decency of a calm conversation when he\u2019s the one who flew off the handlebars in the first place? Just insane mental gymnastics from this guy. The fianc\u00e9e literally just matched his energy, and he\u2019s out here like, \u201cB-b-but, couldn\u2019t she have responded nicely to me even though I was losing it at her like a raging AH? \ud83e\udd7a\u201d\n\nEdit: spelling, spacing", "Not to mention that he painted her as this evil woman with horrible intentions for his daughter, when she was actually being very nice.", "Why exactly does his hopefully ex fiancee done that sucks?", "\"It's Reddits fault that it went this way\"", "I have a feeling he wouldn't have even needed to ask her about his daughter being included seeing as she never finished explaining - I bet he started screaming right away, interrupting her which is why she didn't get the chance to say about his daughter being a junior bridesmaid.", "Me, too.  That's grounds for immediate dumping.  Who would want to be married to such a reactive person?  And instead of calming, and immediately apologizing, he runs to this subreddit to be told he was right?  \n\nHe should have shut up and groveled immediately.
