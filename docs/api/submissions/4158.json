You're old enough to vote, start a family (I wouldn't suggest this) and die for your country.\n\nAt your present age, your parents have no right to your privacy. They have no say in who you date. The extent to which they control your life from now on is dependent on how much you let them.\n\nIt's really important for you to start asserting yourself as a separate adult person from your parents.

She has no right to your location and her response to finding out you'd turned off your location shows how controlling and irrational she is.

That way your tracker phone goes all the places you'd be expected to go and doesn't raise suspicion. That's really not a long term plan, though, so if you do that then you need to start going further afield with your tracker phone, and just weathering her reaction.

However, you are not safe. Get a new phone. Use that for your real life. Only use your current phone to talk with your parents, leave it in your dorm.

If the parents are paying, then playing nice may ultimately be the better option so that op doesn't suddenly have her funding cut off. Cynical, maybe, but financial arrangements jave to be considered and college can be very expensive", "If OP is not ready to come out yet that's what needs to be done for now.  No one needs to be pressured to come out to homophobic parents.", "Yeah and it's especially hard when you know that your mom will get very emotional when you turn off the location tracking. I've seen my mom panic cause my dad's location tracking stopped working while he was in the middle of a bike tour. My mom was freaking out, assuming that he had been hit by a car or something. She was about to call every hospital in the area. 2h later he came home and had no clue why my mom was panicking. He had simply forgotten to charge his phone and it had died during the tour, making the tracking app fail.\n\nThe same thing happens when it's about me. I don't want that to happen. Even if it means letting her track me. (Tbf it has gotten better. This was mostly an issue when I first moved out. Nowadays my mom doesn't know about 90% of the things I do. I don't see a need to tell her. I'm not doing anything particularly dangerous. Just going out with friends like every other college student.)", "That is exactly what\u2019s happening!

Yes I was with her for a \u201cdecent\u201d amount of my life and she also had me at 16. But when anything comes to me doing something on my own she freaks out because she\u2019s not in control of my decision(mainly when trying to take steps to leave). Or tries to control me using various different methods. When I became an adult this kinda blew up and she spiraled a little more than it was. It really wouldn\u2019t matter to her though if I left(like non-biased opinion or whatever you want to call it but it\u2019s the truth) and when someone who\u2019s used to controlling someone like that at every minute of every day doesn\u2019t get to and feels their grip slipping they start spiraling and making even *more* rash and unhealthy decisions at least in my experience", "Unfortunately this is the best option. If parents are paying for college then it's worth pretending to go along with their demands to avoid tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition fees. Then, when employed and independent, op can stand up to them. Being right won't pay college fees.", "Omg I literally said this and got a ton of downvotes. If you are financially independent then 100% do you\u2026If you are still under their financial care then you aren\u2019t independent. That means there will likely be some compromise.", "Awww. Something tells me there is a lot of agreement about entitlement here. \n\nThis is easy. If you don\u2019t want someone questioning your whereabouts be independent.

Just to make your life easier.", "Nta and do not turn it back on. They need to learn boundaries you are not a child anymore", "NTA, what is sad that you have to hide who you are with your parents.

Have call forwarding on your new phone so that your mom thinks you're always at the dorm, when possible. Take your original w/ you when you go to class, etc., but leave it in the dorm when you go out at night.", "NTA. You're an adult and they have no authority over you. I'd turn it right back off and they can deal with it.", "NTA They are abusive. cut all ties with them and run!!", "That would mean she would have to pay her own way and not rely on her parents for anything including tuition and living expenses.", "Yup.  Get a burner for going out.  Find a way to set it up to forward calls from the parental phone.  Leave parental phone in the dorm.", "Should, but if her parents are financially supporting her education, sometimes avoidance is easier. \n\nI'm so glad I grew up before we all had gps trackers attached to us 24/7.", "You can just move the SIM card to the new phone. The \"find my phone\" feature is connected to the gps in the physical phone, not the sim. Putting the sim in a new phone would keep your number the same."]}
