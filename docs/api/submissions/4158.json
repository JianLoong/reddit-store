We met online while I was still living with my parents, but I moved into the university dorms for the first time a couple of months ago.\n\nSince moving into college, I have had a lot of freedom at my disposal. (For context, I was never allowed to hang out with friends, especially if my parents \u201csuspected\u201d them to be queer or mildly countercultural outside of school. Also, I have a history of being tracked by my parents. So, I never really went anywhere other than school while living at home. Because of this freedom, I was finally able to meet my gf offline! :)\n\nOn our 2nd date, I picked her up at her house and drove up to the city for this concert. While in line, I realized that my Find my iPhone location was still visible to my mother. My mother doesn\u2019t really check my location as often as she does anymore, but does it on occasion. I turned it off as I know my mother would probably not want me in a city at night.\n\nFast forward, my location has been turned off since then. I never thought this was a big deal, since it had been ages since my mother checked it, and she was generally becoming more lenient with me anyway. I told my parents I would be driving home for thanksgiving on a Sunday. On Friday, I slept at my gf's house, and was spending the whole day with her on Saturday. I get a call from my mom when I'm with my gf, and as usual I decline it and plan to call her later in the day.\n\nI drive back to my dorm after that and take a nap. I am woken up by my mother calling me several times, absolutely frantic about practically screaming over the phone that I needed to come home right away. I was very confused. She said that it \"wasn't safe\" for me to be there and that I immediately had to pack and go home (I live 30 minutes away from them). She kept frantically asking where I was and if I was at the dorm, to which I replied of course I was.\n\nI called my dad and asked why she was so frantic. He said my mom found out about me turning off my location and was very worried. He said that she wanted to talk about it with me when I got home.\n\nI had a very bad feeling about this. I was at risk of getting outed, amongst other things. I was afraid that they would find out about all the places I've been (just outings to different towns in the area and the major city near us. No dangerous neighborhoods or unknown areas, no illegal activity). My brain was scrambling for an elaborate excuse to hopefully have this situation blow over. I was able to craft a fake yet believable story and luckily she bought it. Unfortunately, she made me turn on my location again, and after this has probably checked it frequently.\n\nI feel kinda bad that I made her very upset and frantic for my safety. I know for a mother that can be very nerve-wracking and she sounded more afraid than angry.

Normal parents recognise their baby is an adult and acknowledge that as difficult as it is to accept your baby has grown up, it is time to cut the apron strings.

You don't insist on tracking and dictating their every move.", "You can\u2019t have a conversation with a person who is that controlling.

Yes\u2026I did. \n\nBut also if someone is paying a bill and they are dictating their conditions upon paying that bill, the only way to get out of that is to become independent from them, correct? \n\nYes, they are worried about her and that is why they overreacted. I never said they were without fault.  These are my opinions\u2026you can disagree. Have a good day.", "True enough.
