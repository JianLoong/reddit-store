She isn't entitled to your clothes, especially when it sounds like they just don't fit her at all. It really is sad when the child, no offense, in the situation is more mature than the grown adult who's damn near 30 years old. She sounds narcissistic and I wouldn't be surprised if she pulls this on you again. Set clear boundaries and hold her to them with no exceptions.", "NTA\n\nHave you told your mom about her stealing your clothes and forcing you to lie while she's out with other men? It sounds like she's making your living situation unbearable, and your mom needs to help you set boundaries with your sister. If your sister is claiming all of her selfish behavior is due to grief, perhaps she needs counseling so she can learn to function like a decent human being again; that's also something for your mom to suggest or arrange. If your sister can't show basic respect for you and your things, then maybe she needs to consider other living arrangements. \n\nFWIW, I would tell her that you will no longer lie on her behalf. If she's going to be out cheating on her husband or whatever, she needs to either deal with the consequences or find someone who is willing to provide her with cover. It's not your responsibility to make her look good to other people. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to expose her to her husband, but if you're asked a direct question, you have the right to respond honestly.", "NTA. You need a lock on your door to prevent her from taking your clothes", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
