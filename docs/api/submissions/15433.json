Before I changed my last name I told my sister my plan on having my husband's last name and she freaked out and started saying she wanted me to keep my last name because if I changed it then it would feel like we weren't family since our last names were the only thing she felt tied us together since I'm with my husband so much.

Your sister might need professional help. A last name literally is not what ties people together. Your life with them, memories, spending time together, etc does. It sounds like your sister is jealous of your life now. Is she still single?", "Nah\n\nYall both need some therapy. No one is at fault here.", "NTA\n\nYour name, your marriage, your choice, the end.\n\nAs an aside, your sister is young and her perspective will probably mature in time. She'll realize that your relationship means more than a name.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s your name and your decision. \n\nIt seems that your sister has some attachment issues which may be best addressed with therapy.", "NAH.\n\nI don\u2019t think neither of you are TA because of the circumstances y\u2019all been through. I think your sister should seek a therapist. That said, the bond y\u2019all share together is all that matters", "NAH for changing your name but I do think you're not being very sympathetic to your sister. She likely sees you as a mother. Now you're getting married, changing your name and moving to a different state. You even object to her changing her own name to match yours. From her POV it feels like she's being abandoned. \n\nYou're not at fault for your bad childhood but neither is she.", "NTA. \nDistance and lastname should not change how close she feels to you.", "Would be N A H if sister were just sad/disappointed, but NTA for not processing those feelings in a healthy, non-destructive way. The shared last name could very well mean different things to each of you. Neither is inherently right or wrong.\n\nBut it\u2019s your prerogative to change your last name. And beyond the name issue, it sounds like your sister is unhealthily dependent on you (understandably given her childhood!). But the answer to that is professional care, not the demands she\u2019s making of you.", "NTA whatsoever. I agree with the others, your sister needs some therapy. Probably would help you as well. She clearly feels insecure and abandoned, which isn\u2019t true. You haven\u2019t abandoned her just because you got married Ana changed your name. She needs to be reassured that you\u2019re still and always will be her sister. Try to talk her into some therapy! Congratulations on your wedding!", "NAH, your sister is scared, and fear makes you think of worst-case scenarios. So give her time and show with actions that the name change will not change your relationship.", "NTA - it is no more her decision on what you should use for a last name then it would be your decision on what she should use for a last name.\n\nSiblings don't get to choose last names for other siblings. Maybe try not to justify it and lighten up on the whole \"bad memories\" angle though - even if you had wonderful memories you would still be in your right to change your name if that is what you want to do.", "NTA....well done for raising your sister.\n\nBTW, she may not like you moving to another state either which is understandable as you may be the only family she feels safe and secure with.\n\nBest of luck to both of you living your lives.", "NTA Your sister seems enmeshed and jealous. I understand that the intensity and nature of her attachment is a trauma response. However, she is nineteen. \n\nAt this age, the relationship between you two, should have shifted to a more mature space as you are no longer her guardian. \n\nFrankly, I would be worried about her escalating the situation. Therefore, you need to sit down with her and advise therapy, although this issue won't be resolved in one session, she needs to do it for her own long term wellbeing. \n\nThe issue isn't the name change...", "NTA\n\n  You have the right to choose what surname to use. Taking your husband's surname doesn't stop you from being her sister anyway.", "NAH. I kind of get where your sister is coming from, she's feeling lost since you've entered a new chapter of your life. Maybe she doesn't realize that love is what ties you together and that hasn't changed even with a new person in your life. You had rough childhoods. Maybe she needs a little therapy to help her move onto her own next chapter.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Personally, I hate the idea of women changing their names when they marry and seemingly giving up their identity. But, if that's their choice, it's their right to do so. \n\nYour sister is overreacting by saying you \"wouldn't be family\" if you changed your name. You will always be sisters, no matter what; you will always be family. What does she think happens when other women change their names on marriage? They're no longer \"family\" with their siblings, parents, etc?\n\nI think of Shakespeare: a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. If both of you changed your names you would still have that familial bond regardless.", "NAH. \n\nYour relationship with your sister trumps any surname. You\u2019ve changed your name, not your relationship with her. In time, she\u2019ll realise that. \n\nI feel you on disassociating with your old name. I changed my surname by deed poll so that I wasn\u2019t tied to a family that I\u2019ve had nothing to do with for half my life. It\u2019s a name I chose for a reason, and it feels authentically me. My family were toxic AF, and knowing I don\u2019t want to get married, the next best step was just to change my own name. So I did. \n\nBut your sister feels like she\u2019s losing you. You say you want to move states, so I assume that would mean less time spent together? That\u2019s got to hurt. \n\nI know you\u2019re making a life for yourself now. You\u2019re married, moving away, starting afresh. But I\u2019d bet dollars to doughnuts that your sister feels like you\u2019re abandoning her (not that I am accusing you of this, just what I believe she might think). And whilst I sympathise with you because you deserve a new start, I also sympathise with her. \n\nUltimately, I think you should sit down one on one and talk honestly and openly about what you each want/need going forward. Be sympathetic. Understand her viewpoint even if you don\u2019t agree with it. \n\nYou\u2019re not the AH here, but neither is your sister.", "NAH", "NAH. You both went through a lot of trauma, it's understandable that there are a lot of rough emotions surrounding this.

Your sister is looking upon you as a mother figure - understandable, even though there are only 4 years between you. However, you have done more than enough.   \n\n\nYour sister needs to learn to become independent.", "This. If it's just your last name connecting the two of you, you have much bigger problems.\n\nAlso, you say that you and your husband are in a relationship for six years so this couldn't have come as a big surprise to your sister.", ">You even object to her changing her own name to match yours.\n\nThat would be ridiculous.

It's now time I worry about myself.", "I would not be. I feel that's just unnecessary", "I'm totally ambivalent about last names. Certainly my former last name in no way was my identity. That's solidly in my brain cells. I wouldn't have changed it when I got married, though, more to avoid paperwork than anything else,  except that I think (and my older sisters all agree) that our former last name was one of the ugliest out there. Even my dad hated it. So 3 of us adapted our husbands' way nicer last names. Unfortunately my oldest sister's husband's name was even worse than ours-- think something that sounds like Asshol--ton. Who knew that was possible? Anyway, it's up to OP which name she uses. Her sister needs therapy. A terrible childhood like theirs can be very difficult to overcome without professional help. NTA", "OP objects to her sister changing her name.", "NTA - You have done your best for your sister. You took care of her. You made sure she had food when you were just 11. What amazes me is that you're only 4 years older than her. It's not like you're so old and she's so young. You're very young too. \n\nShe should learn to be happy for you rather than being sorry for herself. She was raised by a selfless person such as you and she should learn not to make everything about herself. This is your time and you're making a fresh start you fully deserve. She's so wrong to demand these kinds of things and making you feel guilty when you should only be happy and proud. But again she's very young and I think she will learn to do better. \n\nI wish you a happy life with your husband.", "NTA, but I think your sister is scared of losing you as you were the only stable 'parent' in her life. The name change and moving away could be triggering some feelings of abandonment.\n\nShe needs some therapy to deal with the changes. Reassurance from you that your relationship is going to change too, but you still love her, but she also needs time and grows into herself. You also need to separate from the parental role you've been in for a long time and enjoy married life. I think she's having a hard time of it, and the anger is a reflection of fear that you won't care about her anymore once you leave.", "NTA your name your choice.", "NTA. \n\nWhen a couple decides to get married they pick 1 last name for their family. Which is what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re choosing 1 last name for your new family. Your children will have your last name as well. \n\nYour sister is immature and doesn\u2019t understand that. It\u2019s nothing against her, as she\u2019s been pushed to believe that a last name defines family. \n\nLet her know that as an adult she can change her last name as well, IF she wants to. But you\u2019re doing this for your family.", "NTA\n\nI think your sister is being extreme. But that could be because I don't share a last name with most of the people I consider family.", "NTA - I understand why she feels that way and how hurtful this must be for her, but she needs therapy. Asap. You\u2019re fully right to take your husbands last name, there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. But I guess it also gives her feelings of leaving her behind with your past. Like you\u2019re out now and she still has to have the name and live with it alone and is still in this nightmare. You know what I mean? She needs help, but you can\u2019t help her with this. You can support her, but this needs a professional to take care of.", "NTA. Your sister (and probably you) need therapy. I don\u2019t understand the big deal with last names personally but if she feels this strongly to the point of insisting then she needs to get help", "NTA neither is sis. Family trauma is real in a multitude of ways. I'm 36 and have never been married but I changed my last name at age 24. It isn't easy, it's hard work, but therapy would be great for both you and sis. Sending good vibes your way. Hope for your marital happiness, your family bonding with sis, and hopefully your shared healing and growth into adulthood.", "NAH.   Sounds like she needs some help/therapy.", "NAH - attachment issues lead to your sister putting too much emphasis on a name although you insistence of changing it because it connects you to a bad childhood isn\u2019t much different. At the end of the day it\u2019s just a name. You can change your name for whatever reason you want - marriage is a legit reason- I think the hurt come from the fact that you picked your child hood as a reason- a childhood that your sister probably hood very near and dear since you are absent from her life more now as an adult.", "NAH I can understand why each of you feels the way you do. You both need a lot of therapy though.", "NTA, but neither is your sister.  She might be afraid of loosing you as I'm sure than it's more than your name that bonds you together. I think that she needs to know that you will still be her sister even with a different name.\n\nCounselling or talking therapy might be something to look at, for her to cope with her anxiety of loosing you and possibly for you to get some closure on you past.", "NTA \nSister seems to have separation anxiety.", "NTA but she clearly needs therapy and chosen family of her own", "NTA \n\nYour sister needs therapy. A lot more than a surname ties the 2 of you together.", "NTA.  Last names are the only thing that she feels ties you together?  Ooooh, boy.", "Disagree. NTA. It's VERY common for a woman to take her husband's surname (in the culture that OP clearly lives in). This should not be a shock to the sister and is absolutely not anything to do with the sister. Sister is trying to make this about her. OP has already done so much for sister.", "OP has spent her life worrying about her sister when she was only 4 years older than her. She clearly is not her mother. She is a selfless sister who was just as young as her who went hungry so that her sister could eat.\n\nMaybe this time OP needs her sister to be happy for her rather being sorry for herself. OP's turning her life around and she has the right to focus on herself and her husband. The sister should not make everything about herself.", "\"It's now time to worry about myself\" this is a very good ideology to have.\n\nYou're never a bad person for taking this route, but accept to her that this DOES feel like a betrayal, you *could* work through her feelings with her but by all means, you shouldn't have to.\n\nYou've spent you're entire life parentified, even if it burns a bridge with her and is a little \"assholey\", it's ok if you live your life. You've done enough for her.", "When you said that the name ties you to bad memories, it probably sounded like you were saying your time raising her was all a bad memory. I would just try to communicate to her that you love her and that you have wonderful memories of/with her, and that the issue is the name having an association with bad memories of your parents, not bad memories of her.", "While its understandable to worry about your own things, your sister still needs you. Even adult siblings are often still very close.  Maybe show your sister that you don't need to share the same name to still be family through keeping in contact more, sending cards,etc?", "I agree, it's up to the individual.", "It's not remotely assholey. OP has done nothing at all assholey. OP has been an awesome human. Sister needs a bit of a wake up call to say that OP is not her mother and was an amazing sister. It's OPs time to put herself first for a change."]}
