I have a sister whose nineteen and basically for her whole life I've raised her. Our parents were in and out of the house.

Your sister might need professional help. A last name literally is not what ties people together. Your life with them, memories, spending time together, etc does. It sounds like your sister is jealous of your life now. Is she still single?", "Nah\n\nYall both need some therapy. No one is at fault here.", "NTA\n\nYour name, your marriage, your choice, the end.\n\nAs an aside, your sister is young and her perspective will probably mature in time. She'll realize that your relationship means more than a name.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s your name and your decision. \n\nIt seems that your sister has some attachment issues which may be best addressed with therapy.", "NAH.\n\nI don\u2019t think neither of you are TA because of the circumstances y\u2019all been through. I think your sister should seek a therapist. That said, the bond y\u2019all share together is all that matters", "NAH for changing your name but I do think you're not being very sympathetic to your sister. She likely sees you as a mother. Now you're getting married, changing your name and moving to a different state. You even object to her changing her own name to match yours. From her POV it feels like she's being abandoned. \n\nYou're not at fault for your bad childhood but neither is she.", "NTA. \nDistance and lastname should not change how close she feels to you.", "Would be N A H if sister were just sad/disappointed, but NTA for not processing those feelings in a healthy, non-destructive way. The shared last name could very well mean different things to each of you. Neither is inherently right or wrong.\n\nBut it\u2019s your prerogative to change your last name. And beyond the name issue, it sounds like your sister is unhealthily dependent on you (understandably given her childhood!). But the answer to that is professional care, not the demands she\u2019s making of you.", "NTA whatsoever. I agree with the others, your sister needs some therapy. Probably would help you as well. She clearly feels insecure and abandoned, which isn\u2019t true. You haven\u2019t abandoned her just because you got married Ana changed your name. She needs to be reassured that you\u2019re still and always will be her sister. Try to talk her into some therapy! Congratulations on your wedding!", "NAH, your sister is scared, and fear makes you think of worst-case scenarios. So give her time and show with actions that the name change will not change your relationship.", "NTA - it is no more her decision on what you should use for a last name then it would be your decision on what she should use for a last name.\n\nSiblings don't get to choose last names for other siblings. Maybe try not to justify it and lighten up on the whole \"bad memories\" angle though - even if you had wonderful memories you would still be in your right to change your name if that is what you want to do.", "NTA....well done for raising your sister.\n\nBTW, she may not like you moving to another state either which is understandable as you may be the only family she feels safe and secure with.\n\nBest of luck to both of you living your lives.", "NTA Your sister seems enmeshed and jealous. I understand that the intensity and nature of her attachment is a trauma response. However, she is nineteen. \n\nAt this age, the relationship between you two, should have shifted to a more mature space as you are no longer her guardian. \n\nFrankly, I would be worried about her escalating the situation. Therefore, you need to sit down with her and advise therapy, although this issue won't be resolved in one session, she needs to do it for her own long term wellbeing. \n\nThe issue isn't the name change...", "NTA\n\n  You have the right to choose what surname to use. Taking your husband's surname doesn't stop you from being her sister anyway.", "NAH. I kind of get where your sister is coming from, she's feeling lost since you've entered a new chapter of your life. Maybe she doesn't realize that love is what ties you together and that hasn't changed even with a new person in your life. You had rough childhoods. Maybe she needs a little therapy to help her move onto her own next chapter.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Personally, I hate the idea of women changing their names when they marry and seemingly giving up their identity. But, if that's their choice, it's their right to do so. \n\nYour sister is overreacting by saying you \"wouldn't be family\" if you changed your name. You will always be sisters, no matter what; you will always be family. What does she think happens when other women change their names on marriage? They're no longer \"family\" with their siblings, parents, etc?\n\nI think of Shakespeare: a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. If both of you changed your names you would still have that familial bond regardless.", "NAH. \n\nYour relationship with your sister trumps any surname. You\u2019ve changed your name, not your relationship with her. In time, she\u2019ll realise that. \n\nI feel you on disassociating with your old name. I changed my surname by deed poll so that I wasn\u2019t tied to a family that I\u2019ve had nothing to do with for half my life. It\u2019s a name I chose for a reason, and it feels authentically me. My family were toxic AF, and knowing I don\u2019t want to get married, the next best step was just to change my own name. So I did. \n\nBut your sister feels like she\u2019s losing you. You say you want to move states, so I assume that would mean less time spent together? That\u2019s got to hurt. \n\nI know you\u2019re making a life for yourself now. You\u2019re married, moving away, starting afresh. But I\u2019d bet dollars to doughnuts that your sister feels like you\u2019re abandoning her (not that I am accusing you of this, just what I believe she might think). And whilst I sympathise with you because you deserve a new start, I also sympathise with her. \n\nUltimately, I think you should sit down one on one and talk honestly and openly about what you each want/need going forward. Be sympathetic. Understand her viewpoint even if you don\u2019t agree with it. \n\nYou\u2019re not the AH here, but neither is your sister.", "NAH", "NAH. You both went through a lot of trauma, it's understandable that there are a lot of rough emotions surrounding this. Give it time and consider getting help for yourself and encouraging your sister to do the same.", "NTA - if having the same surname means that much to your sister, couldn't she change her name too?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's solidly in my brain cells. I wouldn't have changed it when I got married, though, more to avoid paperwork than anything else,  except that I think (and my older sisters all agree) that our former last name was one of the ugliest out there. Even my dad hated it. So 3 of us adapted our husbands' way nicer last names. Unfortunately my oldest sister's husband's name was even worse than ours-- think something that sounds like Asshol--ton. Who knew that was possible? Anyway, it's up to OP which name she uses. Her sister needs therapy. A terrible childhood like theirs can be very difficult to overcome without professional help.
