I (21F) just arrived home from college to find out my mom (48 F) planned a trip we had been dreaming about since I was a little girl, but I\u2019m not included. \n\nLet me give some background. Since I was young, my mother and I always planned to go on a trip to Italy together, to see everything for the first time [together]. My mom is a single mother who has raised three kids, myself being the middle child, my older brother going no contact (for reasons not connected to this), and my younger brother. Since my mom was a \u201cgirl mom\u201d, we were always close. We made dreams together, plans for our future where she would always be close to me. This trip to Italy was a big ticket item in our book of to-dos. \n\nFlash forward to tonight- I was eating dinner with my family and my moms boyfriend (50 M) dropped the bomb that he\u2019d bought tickets for them to go to Italy this summer. I shit you not, it was like a movie was playing out in that room. Everyone went quiet and just looked at me. I thought since it was near Christmas, maybe he\u2019d accidentally spilt a secret gift that I was to receive. So I looked and went \u201ctickets?\u201d And then I saw it. The look on my mothers face that said it all. She\u2019s wasn\u2019t planning on taking me. I silently got up, went to my room, and locked the door. In retrospect, I should have stayed to talk to her, but I was so heart broken and betrayed, I felt that distance was the only thing keeping me at bay. As I walked away, I heard her (my mom) say, \u201cgreat. Now Christmas is ruined.\u201d\n\nAfter a while, my mom barged into my room, sitting down and explaining to me that she had an opportunity to go, and that I would have done the same thing. I harshly bit back that I would not have taken any opportunity that went against our plans. She told me that she was lonely, without a partner when she said the things she did about us going together. I was already devastated, betrayed, and this was the icing on the cake. We started screaming, she said that our generation was too sensitive, that we all feel like feelings have to be, and I quote, \u201cvalidated or whatever the fuck that means.\u201d She told me if I wanted to ruin our relationship over this trip then it\u2019s my decision. Here\u2019s where I might be the asshole. I told her that I would pack up and leave before Christmas then, but she would be losing another kid to her pride, just like she did when my older brother walked out on us. Reddit, am I the asshole for blowing up on and saying what I did to my mom after she hurt me for ruining our dreams of going to Italy together?\n\nETA: I didn\u2019t mention that before I told her she would lose me like my brother, she told me to leave like him. That one hit hard because my brother blamed her for preferring me, and he punished me (both verbally and physically for it) at ten years old.\n\nETA2: I was asked to put this part in for clarity. The trip was not planned for her and her bf alone. This is a trip with many people going. Another point I can now remember from the argument now that I\u2019m calmed down (a bit) is that she told me my dreams are not reality and I have to deal with that.", "created_utc": 1671846126, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztyjxk/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_mom_after_she_breaks_a/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Older brother was probably very loved... until sister is born. Sister is very much like mother, causing them to bond and brother to feel left out. They even plan extravagant trips that dont incule brother. Of course, sister is a child and not the one to blame for that. Older brother still took it out, physically and mentally, on sister. Mother didn't particularly care. Brother left. Now it's just mother and daughter, but daughter has to go to college. Now mother needs someone new. She found him! And he can pay for mother's fun trips! Mother knows it will hurt daughter, so she keeps it a secret. It slips. They argue. Mom says leave like brother. Daughter says I will right now!\n\nNta.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry this happened but I know I would feel the same as you. Walking away was mature, your mom created the screaming not you.", "> Since my mom was a \u201cgirl mom\u201d, we were always close.

This trip to Italy was a big ticket item in our book of to-dos.\n\n> She told me that she was lonely, without a partner when she said the things she did about us going together.\n\nThis sounds like codependency/parentification - when a parent uses their child as a partner. It is a form of emotional abuse.\n\n> That one hit hard because my brother blamed her for preferring me\n\nYou may have been the golden child and your brother the scapegoat. I'm sorry that you were then further abused by your brother.  \n\n> my mom barged into my room\n\nDoes she have a habit of entering your room often without asking or knocking (but getting very annoyed if you did the same)? Privacy boundaries being ignored is not a great sign either. \n\n> sitting down and explaining to me that she had an opportunity to go, and that I would have done the same thing\n\nIt doesn't sound like you would have acted that way, given this is a lifelong dream you've shared together and your feelings of betrayal. \n\n> she said that our generation was too sensitive, that we all feel like feelings have to be, and I quote, \u201cvalidated or whatever the fuck that means.\u201d \n\nYour feelings are valid. Your parent has discussed these plans with you for years. It is normal to feel heartbroken when you are bitterly disappointed by a loved one, and told you are too sensitive for having these feelings. It is normal to want time alone to process this news. You did the mature thing and stepped away to deal with your emotions. \n\n> She told me if I wanted to ruin our relationship over this trip then it\u2019s my decision.\n\nThis sounds like DARVO tactics, another form of manipulation (Deny, attack, reverse victim and offender). *She* has decided to go on the dream holiday. *She* has made her priority very clear to you. You are not ruining anything. She is reversing herself to be the victim - also the passive aggressive comment of \u201cgreat. Now Christmas is ruined.\u201d She could have told you the news in a multitude of ways that would have been less hurtful, or discussed some kind of compromise with you. Instead, her boyfriend broke it to you in a way that literally raises and then smashes your hopes. *To stress it again, it is normal to be upset by this kind of behaviour.*\n\nYou may want to read Adult Children Of Emotionally Immature Parents. There's also a great YouTube channel Patrick Teahan, a therapist who talks about dysfunctional family systems (particularly codependency). If you prefer Reddit, there's r/emotionalneglect, r/CPTSD and r/raisedbynarcissists. Apologies for the wall of text, but I wish someone had told me about these toxic behaviour signs at 21. NTA", "NTA, your mom didn\u2019t tell you about it, and when you found out she basically started blaming you for\u2026 your feelings? I can see why your brother went NC on her, and the things she said to you were super fucked up. \n\nYou\u2019re mom shouldn\u2019t have made a promise she never intended to keep, and telling you to leave \u201clike your brother\u201d shows you a glimpse of what you\u2019re future relationship will be like with her now. Every time she lies to you, or ditches you, or puts herself before you and you get sad, she\u2019ll say \u201cthen just leave\u201d! Total victim complex.\n\nYou should listen to her and go, it might hurt but it\u2019ll hurt less than having to see your mother put you last all the time.\n\nAlso you should really mention how it\u2019s not just your mom and her bf going, and how he wanted to invite you and apparently your mom was against it to the post OP.", "NTA I can understand why you are hurting. There is a whole world your mum and her bf could have picked to visit. Your mum knew you wanted to go and so wasnt going to say anything. Everyone at the table knew you wanted to go cos they all looked at you. And then your mum stabs you in the heart saying she only made plans with you when there was no one better around. So sad. Hopefully you and your mum can work through this and she will understand your feelings.", "NTA. Your mother clearly knew how much a trip to Italy with her meant to you yet chose to say nothing to you about it. Others will say your response was over the top but I can see why you did and said the things you did. I would have been mightily upset too. It wasn't enough that the trip you hoped for - and justifiably expected  - was planned with someone else but then she threw everything back on you and refused to accept any responsibility. I don't know why they couldn't have organised a trip to another country - there's a few places in Europe, last I checked - and then Italy could have been saved for you and your mother at a later date. From the reaction of those in the room when the secret was spilled I'm thinking everyone else was aware of the dream holiday you had been hoping for so it's not as if your mother forgot, she just rode roughshod over you and your feelings.\n\nI'm not sure that saying outright that you are leaving home is the best plan going forward, it gives your mother the idea she is being given an ultimatum and few respond well to that. I've always found it best to offer someone a choice, some room to move in resolving an issue. Talk to your mother and tell her everything you feel (try not to be accusatory) and that you now think the relationship has been badly damaged...and that it may very well be permanent and if so you will have to move out. Give her a chance to rectify things.", "NTA I can see why people would say that she didn't necessarily owe you this trip and she finally gets a chance to - but she's refusing to see why this means so much to you. She can still go, have fun, whatever, but understand she still did somewhat wrong by you. If my mom did this I'd be hurt too. \n\nBut the ETA is a little confusing - he hurt you when you were ten? What did your mom do about it? If she's comparing you to him just because of a disagreement vs him actually hurting you then that's really f'ed up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
