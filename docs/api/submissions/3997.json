Like are you trying to set up your 11 y.o.?", "NTA. You don't owe him anything anymore except the right to see his children if he is a fit parent.  If he wants his birthday acknowledged by his child he can call them on his birthday and talk to them.", "nta. his birthday is none of your business and you shouldn\u2019t be responsible for remembering it", "INFO: Does he help her get a card/present for you on your birthday?", "NTA\n\nif he was a.loving dad, he would have said in advancae to her \"hey, honey, in a couple of days is my birthday. We could have some fun time together. What would you like to do?\" or \"Hey, my birthday is coming, we're going to have a party when my turn comes\" something like that.\n\nNah, narcissists...", "NTA. If he had a better relationship with his daughter he wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.", "No, NTA, he's your ex husband for a reason and an ex's birthday is not in anyone's front of mind.", "NTA, he could ALSO have reminded his daughter of his upcoming birthday.  That said, I have often been the one that had to remind my stepdaughter of her father\u2019s birthday, and take her shopping to get him a gift, and remind her to text or call him periodically.  Maybe setup a Google Calendar with all her dad\u2019s important dates and have her add that to her phone so she gets reminders?", "Nta. It's inappropriate how he spoke to your daughter, she's 11 and he's a grown man. \n\nBut as the kid of divorced parents and raising a kid who isnt my biokid, may i suggest you take a different approach to this. Take him and his rudeness out of it. Ask your *daughter* if these days are something she would like help remembering. Ask her if there's anything in particular she would like to do for the days - card, letter, gift, etc. That way you're supporting her in her relationships, regardless of how her father is an AH. One thing I didn't appreciate about my mom when I was a kid but appreciate now was that she let our relationship with our dad be ours- she'd give us money, take us shopping, and ship presents to him despite him being a major AH who abused her. She didn't have to, and I'm sure she wasn't ever happy to. But she let us take the lead on it", "When you divorced him, you lost any responsibility for remembering these things.  NTA.", "NTA \n\nWhen\u2019s the last time he reminded her of your birthday?\n\nYou\u2019ve been a solo parent for so long, it\u2019s easy to forget he could take on a parenting task occasionally. Isn\u2019t he her parent too?  Couldn\u2019t he make sure she knows the dates that are important to him?", "NTA, but since he uses this to try to guilt her and cause drama, maybe program it into your phone calendar to remind her next year a week ahead of time? Or, if she has a phone/ tablet, put a reminder on her device? Just a \"set it and forget it\" reminder set to repeat yearly. Heck, buy 10 birthday cards & stamps so she has them ready to drop in the mail once a year. Make dealing with this nonsense as simple and humdrum as possible.", "Why couldn\u2019t he call on his birthday? It\u2019s giving setup.

It sounds like you're giving him normal treatment that's parallel to the relationship. Once a month isn't a whole lot of involvement (trying not to judge but...). Idk the full situation but just by this info?... NTA", "NTA due to him being manipulative and for your own peace of mind to move on. \n\nBased on my limited experience as a child of divorce my mum would do the father/birthday stuff for him with me. Now my dad NEVER did any of this with me.... though I will say my step mother stepped up when I was a young teen and let me pick my mum a nice Xmas gift.\n\nBut by time I was mid teen mum stopped doing the usual father/birthday thing aside from reminding me of the day coming up. It was on me then to make the phone call. \n\nYou have done your part though by telling kiddo to put info on her phone calendar. Might I suggest fathers day too to avoid drama in future.", "NTA I betcha he never said anything to remind daughter about *your* birthday, has he? Honestly, I would be very surprised if that were the case, and if it is not, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.", "If he's trying you should be helping, if your daughter wants the relationship. I understand not remembering on the day, but you could have had it calendared and arranged a few minutes for your daughter to call him before or after the event. An 11 year old should not be expected to remember.  \nThis all assumes that he's trying and your daughter wants him in her life.Try to see his side.", "Yeah I know he's trying to manipulate her. I have tried to raise her to recognize that behavior. Not necessarily from him, because I don't talk bad about him in front of her, but rather just protection for her own self from anyone like that. Like reorganizing the red flags and how to handle that.", "Once.", "Yup. It's honestly sad. I never speak badly of him in front of her. Just the other day we talked about how he's doing so well and we are happy about that. He's a recovering drug addict and sadly she knows way more about it than she should at her age but that's all on him cause he OD'd when he had her (this was 3 years ago)", "This is a really great comment.", ">If he's trying you should be helping\n\nHe should ensure he sets up a tradition with his daughter. He should NOT make his ex-wife who owes him NO obligation to remember his birthday, responsible for that.", "I\u2019m glad you are aware of it and are teaching her to be proactive with that sort of behavior from others. Rest assured though you did nothing wrong.", "Yeah, NTA. You\u2019re just protecting yourself and your daughter from someone you know to be abusive (even subconsciously). Tbh, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been able to forget something.", ">he OD'd when he had her\n\nOh dear, I'm sorry for your child, it should be so horrible!", "NTA. He sounds like a narcissistic jerk", "NTA \u201cHey it\u2019s my birthday on Saturday so please remember to call. I would love to hear from you.\u201d", "He is not trying. His daughter is his new victim.", "Good, lessens the chance of her ending up with someone just as abusive because she thinks it's normal behavior. NTA."]}
