I was devastated to say the least.  We had been together since we were 16.  The divorce was rough because she was with her AP and just had this casual attitude about the whole thing and how we were going to be great co-parents to our 5 & 7 year old children.  Well AP bounced shortly at about 1.5 months into our separation, at that point she wanted to reconcile but the damage was done.  I was fairly ruthless in the divorce I'll admit but at that point my whole marriage/life felt like a waste.  I focused on work and my kids and pulled myself through it.  I really have no emotions left for my ex I'll admit, I cried those tears out when I first found out.  I don't engage really at all past texts that concern our kids or schedules.  I have my kids for the week and my wife has the weekends.  I think the rose colored glasses have started to come off and reality has started to set in for my ex.  She recently keeps trying to interject herself in little ways into my time with the kids.  She's asked me to do things like help her with her new house, fix things etc.  I always refuse  or make an excuse up.  \n\nThis was the first mother's day after our divorce and today I got a bunch of texts from her telling me how she's sorry for everything and blah blah and that she's really hurt that I didn't take the kids out shopping for her mother's day presents so that she could have surprise gifts.  She said that as their father it was up to me to make sure they had something for her for mother's day and that no one had done anything for her like we used to. I replied that the kids had craft projects from school in their bookbags for her.  She replied that she just was expected something more special and that perhaps in the future we could spend mother's day together as a family.  I replied that we were no longer a family and that was her decision when she decided to have an affair and fuck some other guy.  I said that my family consisted of my kids and did not include her.  She called me an AH and asked why I was so mean and that it's not fair to the kids somehow and how mother's day isn't going to be the same for them.  At that point I just left her on read.\n\nMy buddy thinks I was a bit harsh since she is the mother of my children so I should be at least open to that but currently I am not there and don't really care if I ever am.  My biggest concern is that I do not want to adversely effect my kids.  My kids will never want for anything I've made sure of that, but the emotional/family situation is where I feel like they will be.  They are so young and none of this is their fault but unfortunately the reality is what it is.  They will never hear me slander my ex or degrade her but what we had as a family is gone now and there is no going back.

You don\u2019t need to do anything for her, IMO reminding the kids about Mother\u2019s Day is enough. She\u2019s living in a delusion with the hope that everything will work out but the game has already ended.\n\nSure, you were a tad harsh but I don\u2019t think it was unwarranted. It was a reality check and hopefully she will recognize where you\u2019re coming from.", "NTA  \nI'll never understand how someone can cheat on someone else and then expect that person to treat them kindly. Civility for the sake of the kids is one thing, but taking time out of your life to make her feel good on Mother's Day? That's ridiculous. If she was still together with the other guy, he would likely be taking them shopping and this wouldn't even be an issue. She's just moping because she screwed around, screwed up your relationship, screwed up her new relationship, and got screwed on Mother's Day because of it. And she's got a screw loose if she thinks it's anything other than that. Tell her to plan better for the next holiday/celebratory day and have someone take her kids shopping, because it won't be you.  \n\n\nOn a side note, if your kids ask you to take them shopping for their mom, don't be that guy that refuses, but feel free to be that guy that doesn't jump at the chance to make her life better.", "NTA. Not whatsoever. \n\nShe had an affair and then left you to be with him. She's only trying to be nice because he left. If they were still together, she wouldn't be trying to talk to you at all.\n\nYou don't owe her anything.", "**NTA.** Like you said, it's pretty clear your ex is regretting her decision. Her real concern isn't the mother's day gifts because your kids already made some for her. Keep in mind, the gifts that the kids create in school are much more meaningful and above and beyond anything you could buy at a store.\n\nShe is just upset because **YOU** didn't buy her anything... She's just now realizing the grass wasn't as green as she thought it was.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day and given her actions she has a lot of nerve to try and make an issue out of it", "NTA.\n\nYour ex is trying to emotionally blackmail you.  She is not your mother.  She is mother to her children.  She should have planned something fun to do.  It is not your responsibility to make holidays for her a great experience.  That is up to her.  You do you and the kids and she needs to learn that she is not part of that equation any longer.  It sucks but that is the prize she won with her decisions.", "NTA. She has to live with her choices.", "NTA. If she wants that date to be special between her and the kids, she can plan something to do with them the day of. She should have absolutely no expectations for you to go any extra mile for her.", "NTA. Mother's day is not your responsibility anymore and certainly not on your dime. My kids father didn't buy gifts for me for our kids to give me. I was always excited to get the gifts my kids made me at school.", "NTA\n\nOnce a cheater, always a cheater. Your safeguards are up FOR A REASON. Be strong fam.", "NTA she wants the privileges of having a partner, but she ruined that. She doesn\u2019t deserve anything from you. The kids have their handmade crafts, she doesn\u2019t need gifts from YOU.", "NTA. Doing anything as a family goes out the window when one partner cheats and shows how little concern they have for the family by their actions.\nMy ex husband had more than one affair and my 2 daughters often told me I was setting a terrible example for them by staying with a cheating husband. Sometimes the family unit doesn\u2019t serve any purpose other than to keep kids in a situation they\u2019d be better off not seeing modeled as what a family should look like. \nDon\u2019t fall for her attempted manipulation now, or ever.", "NTA- she lost the right to \u201cnormal\u201d family activities and gift giving on that level.", "NTA. Your only obligation is to stay civil because of the kids, and to maintain a neutral attitude with regard to the mother in front of your kids. You owe her nothing. A reminder to your kids to tell her Happy Mother\u2019s when they see her is being generous, but necessary. When they get a little older they may request you to take them to the store so they can buy her something\u2026then that\u2019s another story. And again, you would be doing it for your kids, not for her. \n\nHer misery is of her own doing. You are not the bad guy. She (quite literally) fucked around and found out!", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe made her choice, and there are rewards and consequences for every choice we make. You are not in a good place to negotiate terms and are doing well to coparent. You are establishing healthy boundaries and setting expectations. She doesn't have to like them, but she has to respect that there is nothing left for her with you. As you heal, I do hope you find joy and stop feeling angst at the sight of her or things that remind you of her. You are doing the right thing. If she wants gifts from the kids, she can do it herself or have the guy that she cheated with do it. When people cheat, it means that what they have found away from home was worth the possibility of losing what they already had at home. She is realizing your value too late, and that is no longer your problem.", "Nope definitely NTA. The good old she fucked around and found out! She now has to live with the consequences. \u201cMother\u2019s Day won\u2019t be the same for the kid\u201d is bullshit! It won\u2019t be the same to her except for the little gifts they make her in school. You\u2019re not obligated to buy her gifts for any occasion. She trying to emotionally manipulate you, don\u2019t fall for it! If she wanted to do things as a family she shouldn\u2019t of had an affair!  Keep focusing on your and your kids!!", "NTA as you owe HER nothing but... maybe in the future you could maybe use it as a way to spend your own quality time with the kids by continuing the craft theme with them- spend some time with them while they make something to give to her. That way the children have the experience of spending time with you and the excitement/pleasure of giving their mother a gift for mother's day (which most children love to do). That way, you and the children benefit more than her and she can't complain without sounding extremely ungrateful and selfish.", "NTA. If you have the kids for Mother's Day, it would be appropriate for you to offer your ex a few hours of that day so that she and the kids can spend time together on that day. She can decide for herself how she wants to spend that time. You're correct. You aren't obliged to buy her gifts on behalf of the kids for Mother's day, she's not your person anymore. An affair does one thing really well. It almost guarantees that the relationship is over and that the person who was cheated on will never want anything to do with the cheat beyond what is absolutely necessary.", "NTA for where you\u2019re at. You can do what you want when you\u2019re ready. Some dads do and some dads don\u2019t. Expect Father\u2019s Day to come around and definitely expect to refuse a gift. I can tell where this is heading. Edit: I guess it would be hard to refuse gifts from kids. But you do what you gotta do. If you have to put on a face and say thanks and tell her to knock it off later, do it. \n\nBut I think this isn\u2019t one of those situations where you really know the right answer. Just make sure if your kids ask, help them. And keep fostering a relationship between your kids and their mother. And don\u2019t do your children a disservice and speak bad on their mother in front of them. And if you\u2019re already doing that, then you\u2019re in the right. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nBut also when the time is right, when they ask when they are older, don\u2019t lie to them, either. But keep it clear and direct. \n\nI am so sorry you are dealing with this, OP. This is truly a hard situation.", "NTA - your ex has only herself to blame for her situation.  And I absolutely get having no desire to celebrate her. However, as your girls get older and don\u2019t bring home crafts from school, they might want to buy gifts for their mom. If you are willing/able to help them with that it would be very kind on your part. But you would be doing it for your girls, NOT your ex.", "If her AP didn\u2019t leave her, she wouldn\u2019t be acting like this. But he did & the regret kicked in. NTA", "NTA. Not even a little.", "\"mother's day isn't going to be the same for them.\"\n\nNo, Mother's Day isn't going to be the same for *her.* That's what happens when you cheat on your husband and blow up your family. \n\nAnd \"she just was expected something more special\"??? She has no right to expect anything but what you're doing anymore, and more importantly, you don't want to do more.  You saw to it the kids had presents for her and that's enough.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s using the kids to manipulate you. I know exactly what that\u2019s like. As long as your kids know you love them and will always be there for them then all is right in the world.", ">She said that as their father it was up to me to make sure they had something for her for mother's day and that no one had done anything for her like we used to.\n\nShould have kept her pants on then. My response would have been pretty much what you said. \n\n>She called me an AH and asked why I was so mean\n\nOmg. I would have lost it. \n\nIt is great you're worried about your kids! It's better not to play happy family bs bingo with your ex. Your kids will get confused about what's going on and she will probably lie to them because her behavior thus far really reads that way. \n\nYou don't have to find grace for her. She gave up the right to that. I know some people have shared holidays but lots of people don't. Trying to force it isn't going to work. \n\nYour ex will definitely take the entire mile if you give her an inch. Don't fall for it. She's mad she lost her privileges but that's on her head. NTA.", "Nta but only because the kids had craft projects.  Your responsibility is to your kids, not your ex wife.  You should do things for their benefit.  Kids want to give their mom something for mother's day.  You should support the kids in that goal.  Because they had homemade stuff that base was covered.  The same hold true for birthday and Christmas and other major holidays.  It's about the kids, not her.", "NTA.

The reason to do it would be that it can be a lot for a kid to communicate something that feels somehow forbidden or off limits, like asking you to take them shopping if they sense that you dislike their mom. Keeping all communication open with them might be good for your relationship with them.\n\nShe may not reciprocate for father's day, but it's not really about mother's day or father's day.

She sounds very self-centered and blew up your family and that\u2019s on her. But she\u2019s your kids\u2019 mother. Kids want to love their moms and they want their moms to love them back. Helping to facilitate that relationship only helps your kids. Don\u2019t force your kids to have a relationship with her but don\u2019t influence it either. At some point they will grow up and you want them to look back at your behavior as always putting them first. Go to therapy and say whatever you want/need to but don\u2019t undermine the kid\u2019s relationship with their mom. If there\u2019s going to be issues there, let her be the one to create them. It\u2019s not your children\u2019s problem that their mom cheated. Let them drive the present giving but also facilitate it by asking if they need your help.
