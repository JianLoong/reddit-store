I was devastated to say the least.  We had been together since we were 16.  The divorce was rough because she was with her AP and just had this casual attitude about the whole thing and how we were going to be great co-parents to our 5 & 7 year old children.  Well AP bounced shortly at about 1.5 months into our separation, at that point she wanted to reconcile but the damage was done.  I was fairly ruthless in the divorce I'll admit but at that point my whole marriage/life felt like a waste.  I focused on work and my kids and pulled myself through it.  I really have no emotions left for my ex I'll admit, I cried those tears out when I first found out.  I don't engage really at all past texts that concern our kids or schedules.  I have my kids for the week and my wife has the weekends.  I think the rose colored glasses have started to come off and reality has started to set in for my ex.  She recently keeps trying to interject herself in little ways into my time with the kids.  She's asked me to do things like help her with her new house, fix things etc.  I always refuse  or make an excuse up.  \n\nThis was the first mother's day after our divorce and today I got a bunch of texts from her telling me how she's sorry for everything and blah blah and that she's really hurt that I didn't take the kids out shopping for her mother's day presents so that she could have surprise gifts.  She said that as their father it was up to me to make sure they had something for her for mother's day and that no one had done anything for her like we used to. I replied that the kids had craft projects from school in their bookbags for her.  She replied that she just was expected something more special and that perhaps in the future we could spend mother's day together as a family.  I replied that we were no longer a family and that was her decision when she decided to have an affair and fuck some other guy.  I said that my family consisted of my kids and did not include her.  She called me an AH and asked why I was so mean and that it's not fair to the kids somehow and how mother's day isn't going to be the same for them.  At that point I just left her on read.\n\nMy buddy thinks I was a bit harsh since she is the mother of my children so I should be at least open to that but currently I am not there and don't really care if I ever am.  My biggest concern is that I do not want to adversely effect my kids.  My kids will never want for anything I've made sure of that, but the emotional/family situation is where I feel like they will be.  They are so young and none of this is their fault but unfortunately the reality is what it is.  They will never hear me slander my ex or degrade her but what we had as a family is gone now and there is no going back.

You don\u2019t need to do anything for her, IMO reminding the kids about Mother\u2019s Day is enough. She\u2019s living in a delusion with the hope that everything will work out but the game has already ended.\n\nSure, you were a tad harsh but I don\u2019t think it was unwarranted. It was a reality check and hopefully she will recognize where you\u2019re coming from.", "NTA  \nI'll never understand how someone can cheat on someone else and then expect that person to treat them kindly. Civility for the sake of the kids is one thing, but taking time out of your life to make her feel good on Mother's Day? That's ridiculous. If she was still together with the other guy, he would likely be taking them shopping and this wouldn't even be an issue. She's just moping because she screwed around, screwed up your relationship, screwed up her new relationship, and got screwed on Mother's Day because of it. And she's got a screw loose if she thinks it's anything other than that. Tell her to plan better for the next holiday/celebratory day and have someone take her kids shopping, because it won't be you.  \n\n\nOn a side note, if your kids ask you to take them shopping for their mom, don't be that guy that refuses, but feel free to be that guy that doesn't jump at the chance to make her life better.", "NTA. Not whatsoever. \n\nShe had an affair and then left you to be with him. She's only trying to be nice because he left. If they were still together, she wouldn't be trying to talk to you at all.\n\nYou don't owe her anything.", "**NTA.** Like you said, it's pretty clear your ex is regretting her decision. Her real concern isn't the mother's day gifts because your kids already made some for her. Keep in mind, the gifts that the kids create in school are much more meaningful and above and beyond anything you could buy at a store.\n\nShe is just upset because **YOU** didn't buy her anything... She's just now realizing the grass wasn't as green as she thought it was.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day and given her actions she has a lot of nerve to try and make an issue out of it", "NTA.\n\nYour ex is trying to emotionally blackmail you.  She is not your mother.  She is mother to her children.  She should have planned something fun to do.  It is not your responsibility to make holidays for her a great experience.  That is up to her.  You do you and the kids and she needs to learn that she is not part of that equation any longer.  It sucks but that is the prize she won with her decisions.", "NTA. She has to live with her choices.", "NTA. If she wants that date to be special between her and the kids, she can plan something to do with them the day of. She should have absolutely no expectations for you to go any extra mile for her.", "NTA. Mother's day is not your responsibility anymore and certainly not on your dime. My kids father didn't buy gifts for me for our kids to give me. I was always excited to get the gifts my kids made me at school.", "NTA\n\nOnce a cheater, always a cheater. Your safeguards are up FOR A REASON. Be strong fam.", "NTA she wants the privileges of having a partner, but she ruined that. She doesn\u2019t deserve anything from you. The kids have their handmade crafts, she doesn\u2019t need gifts from YOU.", "NTA. Doing anything as a family goes out the window when one partner cheats and shows how little concern they have for the family by their actions.\nMy ex husband had more than one affair and my 2 daughters often told me I was setting a terrible example for them by staying with a cheating husband. Sometimes the family unit doesn\u2019t serve any purpose other than to keep kids in a situation they\u2019d be better off not seeing modeled as what a family should look like. \nDon\u2019t fall for her attempted manipulation now, or ever.", "NTA- she lost the right to \u201cnormal\u201d family activities and gift giving on that level.", "NTA. Your only obligation is to stay civil because of the kids, and to maintain a neutral attitude with regard to the mother in front of your kids. You owe her nothing. A reminder to your kids to tell her Happy Mother\u2019s when they see her is being generous, but necessary. When they get a little older they may request you to take them to the store so they can buy her something\u2026then that\u2019s another story. And again, you would be doing it for your kids, not for her. \n\nHer misery is of her own doing. You are not the bad guy. She (quite literally) fucked around and found out!", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe made her choice, and there are rewards and consequences for every choice we make. You are not in a good place to negotiate terms and are doing well to coparent. You are establishing healthy boundaries and setting expectations. She doesn't have to like them, but she has to respect that there is nothing left for her with you. As you heal, I do hope you find joy and stop feeling angst at the sight of her or things that remind you of her. You are doing the right thing. If she wants gifts from the kids, she can do it herself or have the guy that she cheated with do it. When people cheat, it means that what they have found away from home was worth the possibility of losing what they already had at home. She is realizing your value too late, and that is no longer your problem.", "Nope definitely NTA. The good old she fucked around and found out! She now has to live with the consequences. \u201cMother\u2019s Day won\u2019t be the same for the kid\u201d is bullshit! It won\u2019t be the same to her except for the little gifts they make her in school. You\u2019re not obligated to buy her gifts for any occasion. She trying to emotionally manipulate you, don\u2019t fall for it! If she wanted to do things as a family she shouldn\u2019t of had an affair!  Keep focusing on your and your kids!!", "NTA as you owe HER nothing but... maybe in the future you could maybe use it as a way to spend your own quality time with the kids by continuing the craft theme with them- spend some time with them while they make something to give to her. That way the children have the experience of spending time with you and the excitement/pleasure of giving their mother a gift for mother's day (which most children love to do). That way, you and the children benefit more than her and she can't complain without sounding extremely ungrateful and selfish.", "NTA. If you have the kids for Mother's Day, it would be appropriate for you to offer your ex a few hours of that day so that she and the kids can spend time together on that day. She can decide for herself how she wants to spend that time. You're correct. You aren't obliged to buy her gifts on behalf of the kids for Mother's day, she's not your person anymore. An affair does one thing really well. It almost guarantees that the relationship is over and that the person who was cheated on will never want anything to do with the cheat beyond what is absolutely necessary.", "NTA for where you\u2019re at. You can do what you want when you\u2019re ready. Some dads do and some dads don\u2019t. Expect Father\u2019s Day to come around and definitely expect to refuse a gift. I can tell where this is heading. Edit: I guess it would be hard to refuse gifts from kids. But you do what you gotta do. If you have to put on a face and say thanks and tell her to knock it off later, do it. \n\nBut I think this isn\u2019t one of those situations where you really know the right answer. Just make sure if your kids ask, help them. And keep fostering a relationship between your kids and their mother. And don\u2019t do your children a disservice and speak bad on their mother in front of them. And if you\u2019re already doing that, then you\u2019re in the right. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nBut also when the time is right, when they ask when they are older, don\u2019t lie to them, either. But keep it clear and direct. \n\nI am so sorry you are dealing with this, OP. This is truly a hard situation.", "NTA - your ex has only herself to blame for her situation.  And I absolutely get having no desire to celebrate her. However, as your girls get older and don\u2019t bring home crafts from school, they might want to buy gifts for their mom. If you are willing/able to help them with that it would be very kind on your part. But you would be doing it for your girls, NOT your ex.", "If her AP didn\u2019t leave her, she wouldn\u2019t be acting like this. But he did & the regret kicked in. NTA", "NTA. Not even a little.", "\"mother's day isn't going to be the same for them.\"\n\nNo, Mother's Day isn't going to be the same for *her.* That's what happens when you cheat on your husband and blow up your family. \n\nAnd \"she just was expected something more special\"??? She has no right to expect anything but what you're doing anymore, and more importantly, you don't want to do more.  You saw to it the kids had presents for her and that's enough.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s using the kids to manipulate you. I know exactly what that\u2019s like. As long as your kids know you love them and will always be there for them then all is right in the world.", ">She said that as their father it was up to me to make sure they had something for her for mother's day and that no one had done anything for her like we used to.\n\nShould have kept her pants on then. My response would have been pretty much what you said. \n\n>She called me an AH and asked why I was so mean\n\nOmg. I would have lost it. \n\nIt is great you're worried about your kids! It's better not to play happy family bs bingo with your ex. Your kids will get confused about what's going on and she will probably lie to them because her behavior thus far really reads that way. \n\nYou don't have to find grace for her. She gave up the right to that. I know some people have shared holidays but lots of people don't. Trying to force it isn't going to work. \n\nYour ex will definitely take the entire mile if you give her an inch. Don't fall for it. She's mad she lost her privileges but that's on her head. NTA.", "Nta but only because the kids had craft projects.  Your responsibility is to your kids, not your ex wife.  You should do things for their benefit.  Kids want to give their mom something for mother's day.  You should support the kids in that goal.  Because they had homemade stuff that base was covered.

She sounds very self-centered and blew up your family and that\u2019s on her. But she\u2019s your kids\u2019 mother. Kids want to love their moms and they want their moms to love them back. Helping to facilitate that relationship only helps your kids. Don\u2019t force your kids to have a relationship with her but don\u2019t influence it either. At some point they will grow up and you want them to look back at your behavior as always putting them first. Go to therapy and say whatever you want/need to but don\u2019t undermine the kid\u2019s relationship with their mom. If there\u2019s going to be issues there, let her be the one to create them. It\u2019s not your children\u2019s problem that their mom cheated. Let them drive the present giving but also facilitate it by asking if they need your help.

BUT you are showing your children the example of how mothers should be treated on Mothers Day.  \n\nNow you didn't say if the children are male or female, but if any are female, how would you like them to be treated when they someday are mothers?  If any are male, how would you expect them to treat the mothers of their children?  As parents, we set the example.  Did she not put her life on the line to bring your children into this world?  Did her body not suffer the repercussions of carrying those children for 9 months each?  Did she not go through several hours or even days of pain and labor?  Did she have a cesarean?  Does she not deserve some kind of appreciation for that?  Mother's Day isn't about marriage.  That's what anniversaries are for.  Mother's Day is celebrating motherhood in all its forms, whether our children are present in the here and now or not.  \n\nSo, why not just work on a homemade gift with the kids during the week while they are with you.  Or even get her just a card with a $10 Starbucks gift card, you know, something small.  Just to show her a modicum of respect for her role as mother of your children.  This will also show your children a great example of what to live up to for when they grow up and have kids of their own.  To be clear, though, this is not you accepting any apologies. You are not getting together or mending anything. You don't have to love her or like her, but you can respect her and what she has given you.  And that's all that this would be.  Simply a man showing respect to the woman who put her life on the line over and over to give birth to and help raise his children.  Not to mention, it makes you look way more adult and grown up and less temper tantrum than her.", "Nothing to add to this \ud83d\udc46 \n\nNTA", "I know you are getting downvoted but I agree. I don\u2019t think he is an AH at all, and honestly, it sounds like this is the first Mother\u2019s Day since it all went down so I\u2019m not surprised by the reaction. AND it sounds like he is setting boundaries to make it clear they aren\u2019t getting back together. \n\nHaving said that, the kids do feel when there is tension, even if nothing bad is said. And they will notice if OP does little things like just say, \u201chey why don\u2019t you make your mom a card.\u201d They will feel safe and secure. Nothing is obligated, but if he can find it in his heart to do it for the kids, it can be a wonderful thing for them", "I found the ex wife.", "So now he should take her to dinner?", "He is putting the kids first. And they made their mother gifts. He even reminded them about the day. She\u2019s just mad because he didn\u2019t go buy gifts to put their name on.\n\nIt\u2019s not his job to buy her shit anymore. Don\u2019t want the smoke? Don\u2019t start the fire.", "NTA- She f\\*cked around and found out what happens when you cheat but gets dumped soon after. You have no obligations to do anything extra for her anymore. You are putting yourself first and her last but making the kids a priority which is the right thing to do. If she wants a special Mother's Day, then she'll have to do it herself or hopes someone else will do it for her.", "NTA, WTF did she expect, she cheated and you had a hostile divorce.", "NTA. The lion, the witch, and the audacity of that b**ch. \n\nIf you want to celebrate mother's day with your kids, maybe do it with their grandma.", "NTA.  They always come crawling back.\n\nShe\u2019ll either get the hint or she won\u2019t.  Not your problem either way.", "NTA.. I must admit, she sounds very self-centred.  It is all screaming, \"What about me?\".. well, she broke up the family. This is what she gets, and now she's demanding gifts?  She should never expect anything from you given the history. However, when the kids become too  old in school, to do the craft projects, remind them it's Mother's Day, and let them choose and pick a card gift. They are a little young, not to need a bit of help at this point. Not because Mum deserves it. But because you're letting them know that this is what is done, when they're old enough to celebrate their own families. You're doing it for future generations. Not for her. You're helping them develop thoughtfulness, kindness, and compassion. Your also showing that being seperated, dosnt mean you can't be kind.You don't need to be involved in anything past that.  They may see her for who she is, when she's older, and stop buying on their own accord. Respect their wishes. Remind them it's Mother's Day. Ask if they want to get her something. Depending on the answer, it will depend on what you do.", "Nta. But i disagree with almost everyone here. You don\u2019t owe her anything. But you are trying to raise kids and show them that they are loved and teach them to be respectful loving people. You don\u2019t have to go overboard, but taking your kids to the store and asking them to pick out a card and a trinket goes a long way for them to realize the value in special days. Think about the message your giving your kids, not the point your trying to make to your ex. It\u2019s your children\u2019s mom, you don\u2019t have to like her, but you need to support your kids in loving her. And I\u2019ve been there so i get it. Just my take.", "Obviously NTA. She will try to wear you down, but good job so far and good luck in the future OP.", "NTA.  \n\nYou might feel more generous when a) she isn't trying to reconcile, b) you have had time and space to grieve the trust and relationship that is gone now and c) when she isn't demanding favours.\n\nWhatever the case, you do not owe her extra effort, especially right now.  It is too soon.\n\nShe should look to someone she didn't betray for support on mother's Day.  If the best you can do is be neutral, that is enough.", "NTA. She comes across as very regretful over her actions and trying to guilt you into getting back together.\n\nYou've made sure the kids had a appreciative gift for her, really nothing more could be expected from you.", "NTA do I think it is sweet when co-parents appreciate their former partners on mothers/fathers day yes BUT that's not always the healthiest thing for those involved. \nIn this case it probably would have given her some false hope and the kids are still young there are going to be plenty more mothers days when the kids are old enough to ask to get her something in which case you should allow it with reason but it's going to take a while to get there and it may never be more than a $20 budget given to the kids.\n\n\nOr \n\n\nAs a side note growing up some of my relatives would want me to visit for some period of time and my mom would always send me with a restaurant gift card that way I could as a child \"treat\" the relatives. If you ever got to the point or the kids wanted to celebrate there mom with a mothers day meal it could be done at a distance just mom and kids. Heck in today's world it could be a food delivery or movie theater gift card. If you ever do decide to \"celebrate\" mother's day it can be more so something for her to do with the kids rather than for her. Zoo tickets, tickets to a children's show at a local theater etc.", "NTA\n\nThe AP fell through and she realizes what a great man she had in you..now she is trying ti butter you up or manipulate you into being a family again.\n\nWhat she fails to realize is that she made sure it will never happen.", "NTA.  But just remember ita about the kids and not her. Getting the kids to make her a card or something wouldnt be difficult. But thats where it ends", "NTA. If being celebrated on mothers' day is important to your ex, she can talk to one of her family members or friends and ask them to help the kids with it.", "NTA but you are still a family, just a family in a different form, and will always be a family because of the kids.  Divorce severs the marital tie, not the family one, and children do far better emotionally once that\u2019s understood and accepted.  The only reason to do anything for her for Mother\u2019s Day would be to model Mother\u2019s Day behaviors and traditions for the children.", "If/ when you get a girlfriend or remarried she is going to make your life a living hell. Be prepared, screenshot / record everything!", "NTA but what the heck is AP? What is the matter with with abbreviations in reddit and also not using a Legend so we know what it means?", "NTA. I\u2019m dating a guy with a child who\u2019s ex is like this, and I wish he had your outlook!", "NTA, That is so bizarre. My ex kept trying to interject himself into Mother's Day and I shut that down. I'm the kid's mom so I'll handle the day the way I want, no need for ex and I to go to a family dinner, have him spend money on me,  etc. Hijacking Mother's Day for personal agendas is so wrong!", "what u said...  certainly not on his dime \ud83d\ude11", "They obviously both wanted the kids and she didn't do anything special just because she had kids she also wanted. By keeping away from her he's teaching his kids that you don't have to be around people you don't want to.", "He did make sure that the kids had crafts from school to give their mother. And I think that's beautiful and enough."]}
