{"id": 3699, "submission_id": "z9yadz", "title": "AITA for leaving my friend at the airport?", "selftext": "I (20f) and my friend, Emma (f22) recently went on a trip to California. She asked if I wanted to go on the trip with her because we'd stay with one of her other friends (Lena, 24f) and go sightseeing. I agreed, we booked our tickets, and she commuted to my city where we'd be taking off from and stayed the night. She told me her ticket back was a lot later in the day on the day we get back to the city, and I told her not to worry, she can stay with me and I'll take her to the station.\n\nI told her specifically that I wanted to go see the Golden Gate Bridge and the Japanese Tea Garden. Her friend's parents housed us at their house so we'd have more room and privacy, and she also picked us up from the airport, prepared gifts for us, and excitedly told us that she's so happy to have guests. We saw the bridge twice, the Japanese Tea Garden, Ghirardelli Square, Japan Town, the Pier, and tons more, and took tons of pictures. Emma always asked if I wanted my picture taken in front of things, and offered to retake or take more photos if I was unhappy with them.\n\nAfter the trip, someone had taken Emma's carryon, which had everything she brought. When I grabbed mine, Emma said, \"OP, my carryon isn't here\", and I didn't really think much of it. It was a long flight, I was tired, and it was super early in the morning. She said that she wanted to try and find it before the person who took it left with it, and she hurried off. I didn't see her past customs, so I left to meet my boyfriend who was picking us up and left without her.\n\nEventually, I messaged her and told her that she could find her own way back to the station. Emma was confused and said that she was supposed to go back with me and my boyfriend since her train was later, and she was just waiting for flight staff to get her carryon back, and if I was leaving her there. \n\nI asked her what she wanted me to do, run after her? She said that she just wanted a bit of understanding that she had her carryon taken, because everything she brought was in the bag and it was a stressful situation. \n\nI snapped back and said that the trip we went on wasn't even to sightsee, it was just so she could see her friend, and she responded that we went to see everything I specifically wanted to see and more. Further, Emma said that Lena hosted us well and drove us around the entire week we were there, housed us, her parents fed us breakfast in the mornings, and Lena paid for all the gas, parking, and tolls. I can admit that I was a little passive-aggressive, but she went on to say that if my luggage was taken, she would be with me as support: I said well it's not my fault she lost her luggage.\n\nEmma hasn't spoken to me since, and has since removed me off everything. I don't think I was wrong, but AITA?", "created_utc": 1669925505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z9yadz/aita_for_leaving_my_friend_at_the_airport/", "score": 4443, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You owe her an apology and if I were her, I would accept it but still choose to cut you out of my life.", "YTA. You're the embodiment of the saying \"With friends like you, who needs enemies\".", "YTA \n\nYou didn't even bother to contact her to give her a chance to decide whether she wanted to keep looking or get a ride back.", "It sounds like you mostly got an expenses paid trip and decided that you couldn\u2019t wait to take your friend home when her bag went missing? I\u2019d apologize if I were you OP. Hard YTA", "Are you for real?  If so YTA massively.  I can understand that she ran off ahead of you but you didn't even try to message her to see where she was or how you could help. You only messaged her 'eventually' after you got yourself a ride home and left her stranded at the airport. If a friend of mine did that to me  after I'd taken them on a holiday with me I'd probably never speak to them again.", "YTA. You're also very selfish, self absorbed and rude.", "Yeah, YTA.  Her bag was taken / luggage lost, and you (who were her ride) just ditched her at the airport while she was trying to resolve it?\n\nYou aren't much of a friend.", "YTA: She did everything you wanted on the trip and you couldn't be bothered to wait slightly longer at the airport to help her out after her stuff was missing / stolen.\n\nYou were absolutely wrong and sound like a trash friend.", "Yes YTA. So clearly yes. Do you not realize how selfish that sounds?", "WOwww, worst friend ever. YTA. Supreme B behavior and zero gratitude that she invited you on a trip that she didn't have to, her friend's family provided housing, transpo, and did what YOU wanted to do, and then when YOUR **FRIEND**'S bag went missing, you immediately noped out. MASSIVE AH", "YTA\n\nSorry OP, but try to take this as constructively as possible. \n\nYou went on a trip with your friend to a place neither of you are from. She lost her suitcase and immediately went into panic mode. Instead of waiting around, check in on her! Maybe even help her look for it.\n\nJust the idea of losing my luggage while traveling is scary. To think my friend who I\u2019m alone with in a new place would ditch me is super depressing.\n\nBe a better friend and apologize, maybe buy her dinner and talk things over. It\u2019s the right thing to do.", "YTA - I understand being tired in the airport but you literally abandoned your friend in an unfamiliar place.

Would've taken all of 10-20 minutes. Through her friend connection she basically got you a huge discount on the trip. You even got to see the sights you wanted to see. And you were with your friend and her other friend which was most important. \n\nRegardless if you had a nice time or not or how you felt about this other friend, that's no way to treat someone. All you had to do was communicate and maybe say let's give it 5 more minutes but you doubt the staff will be helpful and she file a lost baggage claim. That's all there was to it. And you handled it like you were the one treated like crap. \n\n>I can admit that I was a little passive-aggressive\n\nYou acted like a jerk to your friend, who's no longer your friend.", "Incredibly selfish and rude. YTA. You could have at least told her you were leaving. I wouldn't stay friends with you either.", "YTA pretty rude to just abandon her after she's invited you on this trip and made effort to make sure you enjoyed it. You were her ride back, and shouldn't have just abandoned her so quickly. Lost luggage happens, she didn't purposely cause a delay. You could have shown some patience.", "Is this real? Onviously, YTA. You say you didn't want to run after her, but why not? Or why not just wait for her and text your bf. That's just the right thing to do if you're a friend or even just a good person? I've had complete strangers be better to me than you were to someone who's supposedly a friend.", "OP, are you really the one who left the friend at the airport? It sounds like Emma wrote it and posed as you. The writer paints a really one-sided story here. Yes, whoever left their friend at the airport struggling to locate a lost or stolen bag, without texting or waiting, was being an AH.", "YTA, I don't blame your friend at all. I wouldn't wanna talk to you after that either", "Absolutely YTA. Who just leaves someone behind? Her luggage was missing. Her friend\u2019s family hosted you. And you just left her? Are you kidding me right now?!?!?!?", "YTA.\n\nI honestly wouldn't wanna be your friend either, you sound very entitled and selfish. And honestly I wouldn't be surprised if this was the last straw she had with you, considering the way you put it seems like you've been a AH for a while to her.", "**YTA** \n\nIt must have been very distressing for her to have her carryon gone and possibly stolen!  It was not nice of you to abandon her.", "I'm so confused. Could you do a better job of explaining why you might NOT be TA? (YTA)", "YTA.\n\nEven disregarding the facts about the San Francisco trip, you told her that **she can stay with you and you\u2019ll take her to the station after you get back from the trip**.  And you reneged on this while Emma was dealing with a stressful situation. You both have phones, so why did you not call her first before leaving her?", "YTA. You're a crap friend OP. Like completely. I don't know why you even posted considering you don't think you were wrong. \n\nYou were not passive aggressive OP you were full on AH. You wouldn't have even gotten to see and do all that you did because SHE is the one who asked you to come along. All this stuff done for you by her, her other friend AND that friend's family and this is how you repay her? Yeah she was right to drop you as a friend and I hope your mutual friends have heard about your behavior.", "Seriously?  Huge YTA.  Poor you - you were too tired to help her look for her bag?  I can't believe someone could be so selfish.  She set you up for free lodging and free transportation to and from the airport and helped you take selfies, and you walked away when she was in need.  What a sorry excuse for a friend.  If you did that to me you would be my ex-friend.  You are a very self-centered person.", "This is either fake or actually written By Emma.", "You go out of your way to explain how considerate Emma has been only to ask us if YTA for ditching her at the airport after she lost her luggage? No way this is real!", "YTA: You left her at the airport even though you promised to take her back with you and to the station, huge AH. It isn't Emma's fault her luggage was stolen, she was doing her best to get it back and you can't be assed to wait for that to happen, why would ever think that's OK?\n\nYou knew that the trip was with Lena before going, so spending time with her is no reason to abandon Emma. Plus it sounds like Lena and her family were very kind to you.", "Wow you suck. Can\u2019t imagine you keep friends very long. YTA", "YTA - Have you read what you wrote? If you can read your own post and not realize that you were the asshole I don't know why you're asking strangers. I hope your friend never talks to you again. You were awful!!!", "Yta. You got an extremely discounted vacation because her friend provided accommodations for you as well as acting as a free tour guide and photog for you. They made every effort to make your trip enjoyable...and then you ditch your friend in an unfamiliar potentially unsafe place while she's having a crisis and you act like a total selfrighteous dick about it. You are a terrible ungrateful friend and complete AH", "YTA you\u2019re an awful friend", "Obviously YTA, not even a question. Although, just to me personally, this sounds like \"Emma\" wrote it.", "And I hope she never does. They did everything you wanted to do. She went out of her way to be accommodating to you. She got something stolen and you didn't even have a little empathy.  YTA. You are a terrible friend.", "INFO are we sure Emma didn\u2019t write this?", "YTA, can you even hear yourself? You were shown nothing but kindness this whole trip and just ditched your travel buddy at the airport??? Put aside everything else, you reneged on a promise and stranded an innocent person alone at the airport for NO REASON other than you were tired and grumpy. You\u2019re right that it\u2019s not your fault her luggage was stolen, but it\u2019s not her fault either!! You owe her a massive apology", "YTA 100% \n\nI don\u2019t understand how you could have typed this out and not once stopped to think *\u201dhuh, what I\u2019m typing sounds REALLY assholeish\u201d*\n\n**You are a bad friend**", "Wow.

She took you on a nice trip, arranged for a place to stay and to visit all of the places you asked to, then, after her bag gets stolen you just leave her at the airport without even telling her.\n\nThat is not how you treat a friend (or anyone)!  At an absolute bare minimum, before you left the airport you should have at least contacted her to find out where she was and help her make arrangements to get home.  You had told her that she could stay with you and that you would take her to the station!", "I'm trying to figure out if this was written by Emma to make OP look like an HUGE AH because I can't believe someone would write all that then leave a friend who lost their carry-on at the airport and whine about the trip that included everything she wanted including photo retakes.\n\nYTA, OP. Undoubtedly. Why didn't you wait for her?? Surely, if your boyfriend drove, another hour at the airport until she figured things out wouldn't have bankrupted him.", "This is one of those post that is so obviously YTA territory I doubt it\u2019s even real, like seriously how could anyone ever be this inconsiderate.", "\"Emma hasn't spoken to me since, and has since removed me off everything.\"\n\nGood for her. When people show you who they are, believe them.\n\nYTA", "Yta for the lack in communication while you were still in the airport\n\nJust for that\n\nAnd also for not even suggesting to go back and get her or pay for an uber on ber behalf as you agreed to be her ride\n\nThis was shitty and i wouldnt talk to you either\n\nYou didnt even wait until there was a handle on the situation before abandoning her and left without a word\n\nOmg", "YTA seriously", "YTA, hope you apologized", "YTA - omg the biggest YTA.

It's absolutely amazing to me.", "YTA and a horrible, selfish person.", "YTA", "YTA your friend facilitated a fun trip where you paid for very little in the most expensive city in the US.

Your AH boyfriend (bc if he thinks you did nothing wrong, he\u2019s as bad as you) possibly getting honked at is not a big deal. \n\nYou\u2019re pretty selfish, and you seem okay with it. \u201cPassive aggressive\u201d doesn\u2019t even begin to cover it.

You can have your feelings, but those feelings can come from the absolutely, entirely, 100% wrong believe that you are the centre of the universe and that everyone owes you. Your friend invites you to a trip where you go seeing exactly what you wanted to see, but you think she owes you full attention and not focusing on the friend YOU KNEW she was visiting; your friend has an emergency, but you think she owes you stopping to figure out what you want to do before she can deal with the VERY time-sensitive issue; you leave your friend stranded at the airport after telling her your bf would be her ride, knowing perfectly well that her train was way later, but you think she owes you the friendship you just nuked and staying in touch because YOU are upset about how things went on. \n\nYou are an asshole and you are wrong for thinking you have any grounds for being upset.

Do you use your \"friends\" as a free place to stay while you ignore them to play tourist in their city? Like ok, be upset. But it's definitely on you for assuming the trip wasn't primarily to visit her friend. \n\nShe was probably far too busy trying to figure out where her bag was to think about messaging you. Any true friend would in the very least reach out FIRST before just abandoning someone at the airport. \n\nYou do a really great job making everything about you. This trip wasn't about you. You were lucky to get an invite to tag along and then get upset by not being the center of attention then abandon your friend at the airport without warning.
