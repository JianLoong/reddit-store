It always escalates. He's already verbally abusive, including to a 13yo girl.

Geoffrey *is* the loser that he thinks everyone else is.\n\nBut the most important part of this is that *Geoffrey is bullying a child*.

The minute he roped your daughter into his crap he crossed a big boundary. Do not apologize. Just let him know that he's becoming toxic and needs to get counseling for his issues.
