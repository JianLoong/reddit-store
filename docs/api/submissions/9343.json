That\u2019s upper 20\u2019s level resentment right there", "Nta\n\nTell Geoffrey that he *also* peaked in high school as bow he is just insufferable to be around... And your not subjecting you or your family to his fucking GROSS assumptions about people. Then, cut him off.  \n\nHe is clearly bitter as he is just as lonely now as he was in high school... wonder why people don't want to spend time with a prick who has nothing to bring to the table but insecurities and insults", "NTA. I honestly wouldn't recommend even letting your daughter around him. He sounds like he's at the least toxic and unstable, and at worst a full blown incel. 13 year olds don't have the ability to ignore and get over comments like adults do. How long before his behavior escalates? Your brother needs professional help and your family is a bunch of enablers.", "NTA what Geoffrey fails to realize is that he apparently also peaked in high school", "NTA. Essentially bullying your niece is uncalled for and you absolutely did the right thing.\n\nSounds like the one who peaked in high school was Geoffrey! With that mindset, the bullied became the bully! Great job there, Geoff! \n\nI had a shitty experience in high school too. But *having bad experiences/trauma is not an excuse to be abusive to everyone else.* \n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA. But YWBTA if you allow him to be around Emma anymore.", "NTA. Keep him far away from your daughter please. If he\u2019s making those kinds of comments he\u2019s already seeing her as just a woman and not a person. He sounds deeply misogynistic", "NTA\n\nThat said, you're targeting the wrong problem here. Gary's issue isn't that he's still stinging after high school; the problem is that he doesn't know how to keep his mouth shut!\n\nThe easiest way to sidestep invalidating his experiences is to not bring them up. It doesn't matter why Gary says the things he says; his comments are mean-spirited and inappropriate regardless of motive. If anyone else wants to come to Gary's defense, focus the discussion on what Gary did and not why. \"What Gary said was rude and hurtful; my daughter did nothing to him except exist as a teenager in the same space.\"", "NTA. Your brother is the kind of guy I warn ALL my girlfriends to stay away from. The whole world is a bad place out to get your brother in his mind. \n\n He needs therapy and you should seriously consider keeping him away from your kids until he gets help.", "NTA.  I don't know much but the term INCEL comes to mind.", "NTA  \n\n\nI had \"a bad HS experience\" (poor overweight nerd in a fancy rich catholic school) but I still had close friends in and out of that HS and did fun stuff. Does your brother currently have ANY friends?   \n\n\nThere is a reason why he didn't have close friends, and therapy is the place to find out. You're right to be concerned. Honestly he sounds like the kind of kid who would shoot up a school and I don't say that lightly.", "NTA. You were 100% right, and hopefully with some time Geoffrey will be able to see that.\n\nHow old is he?", "NTA. Hope he gets the help he needs because he definitely needs it.", "NTA, and honestly for your daughters sake I would keep him away from her and his comments. She doesn't need to hear them, and it'll only do much worse as she gets older. You're right about him needing therapy I think, a lot of people had/have a rough time in highschool and for some it definitely can and has caused trauma but that doesn't mean you take it out on other people who have nothing to do with it.", "NTA and you show more restraint that I would've. These hands would've been flying if he tried to talk to my daughter like that.", "NTA. You handled it maturely and kindly (in private). He 'tattled' on you to the family. Gees.what an immature AH.\n ' you need more therapy' would be my mantra, said from now on in public, as loudly as he had said the negative remark.  It should be the only and continuous comment while he is in the throws of his spitefulness.  That your family doesn't call him out on his bulls*it, but instead chastises you, make them AH, too.", "NTA. Plenty of people had shitty HS experiences. Most of us got over it as adults.\n\nYour brother is the one stuck in his HS persona. His nasty misogyny towards his own niece is awful. Continue protecting her and urging brother to get help.", "NTA. Ironically, your brother invalidates everyone else's high school experience. His whole view of high school is based on his own experience and teen dramas.", "What a bitter little man", "Yeah, I was bullied in high school (and middle school), and you know what? I got the fuck over it. There are ways it\u2019ll always affect me, but life goes on and no one should let high school define their adulthood. This guy is a pathetic incel asshole.", "Yeah, I can see why no one was a fan in high school.", "What does incel mean?", "\"forming\"? It looks fully formed to me.", "Just a flat line", ">Has Geoffrey considered he had a hard time in high school because of his insufferable personality and nose so high in the air he's basically rimming the Lord? \n\n\nHow does this makes sense? I keep seeing these comments making the same point, but it feels very victim blamey. \n\nHe's a bitter person nowadays, because of his experience as a child. How does this mean that he was always an asshole? Experiences change people, is that not common sense?", "Same!", "Hey fuck you, I love Charizard. Lmao", "\u201cInvoluntary celibate\u201d. \n\nShort version: Dudes who can\u2019t get laid by the women they feel they deserve and are mad about it.", "It's a man that hate woman because he is sexually frustrated and blame them, incel meaning \"involuntary celibate\" . Usually they are deply misogynistic, racist and have many online communitys to gospel this type of hate.", "The story has something positive to it. At least i for my part am glad Kathy did the right thing by not taking OPs brother to prom. Imagine being the girlfriend to such a person.", "In other words\n\n\"I put the nice coins in, why didn't the sex fall out?\"", "Like they nasty things about a woman if she rejects him", "I don\u2019t think he peaked at all", "you have to turn the switch on the back of a girls neck, sometimes it's set to \"douchebags\" instead of \"nice guys.\" once you flip it to the right side, you'll be able to get sex from just being nice*!\n\n*nice in this case is defined as treating a girl with the lowest level of respect possible for another human being", "Like you record how you told them bro is the problem and play that track every time they complain?"]}
