Geoffrey didn\u2019t have any close friends and it was a lonely time for him. He doesn\u2019t have contact with anyone from high school. Geoffrey thinks that if a person has contact with anyone from their high school (even past teachers,) it means they peaked in high school. He constantly makes assumptions about people (often strangers) based on his own high school experiences. The comments he makes are mean-spirited and uncalled for.\n\nAn example is how we were visiting a relative who lives next to a park and there was a random teenager using the fitness equipment. Without any prompting, Geoffrey loudly said \u201cBetter live up those quarterback days now. You\u2019ll be working at a gas station after graduation.\u201d Whenever we go out, Geoffrey makes rude comments about the employees and assumptions about their time in high school. We recently had a very sweet waitress at a restaurant, and Geoffrey felt the need to say \u201cBet she was prom queen once, now she\u2019s fat. Probably raising five kids alone.\u201d As I said, his comments are just mean and uncalled for.\n\nRecently, we were at my parents\u2019 house for their anniversary. My daughter Emma was in the living room doing an online dance challenge. Geoffrey made a comment about how Emma should have \u201cgrown out of\u201d doing online dance challenges and \u201cbe careful, she\u2019ll wind up being her school\u2019s version of Kathy\u201d who was a girl that I and Geoffrey knew in high school. Kathy was always nice to Geoffrey. Geoffrey had gotten angry and refused to talk to her after she went to prom with another boy instead of him.\n\nI reminded Geoffrey that Emma\u2019s thirteen and to just leave them be. Geoffrey again told me to \u201cbe careful\u201d or else \u201cshe\u2019ll end up being that fat single mom who always talks about her cheerleader days.\u201d In the past, I have just told Geoffrey not to be rude, but roping my daughter into his comments was when I had enough.\n\nI pulled Geoffrey aside to a more private area and told him that he needs to get over high school. I know it wasn\u2019t a great time for you and I\u2019m sorry. But you need to stop taking that out on other people. Start seeing a therapist again and do whatever you need to move on. Otherwise, you\u2019re going to end up alone if you keep lashing out at others this way.\n\nGeoffrey told the rest of the family about what I said. I shared my side of the story but several others told me that Geoffrey was \u201cjust concerned\u201d for his niece\u2019s future after graduation and telling him to \u201cget over high school\u201d dismissed/invalidated his experience. And not having close friends during developmental years can affect someone for their whole life.\n\nGeoffrey\u2019s experiences are valid, which is why I told him about returning to therapy so he can work on properly dealing with them. And Geoffrey\u2019s experiences do not give him the right to make such mean-spirited comments about others. It was a harsh reality check but one that I believe Geoffrey needed before he ruins any more relationships. AITA?\n\nAdded for clarification: Geoffrey is thirty-five. He was a freshman when I was a senior in high school. Geoffrey saw a therapist until his mid-twenties, which is when the bitterness and comments really began to come out.\n\nI have distanced myself more and more from Geoffrey. His words toward Emma have really made me consider whether or not I even keep in contact with him.\n\nThere are too many comments to respond to individually but I wanted to express my appreciate for the support and advice you all have offered.

He's a man in his *mid thirties* still fixated on high school, telling teenage girls that they're going to become single mothers and shit. That is not remotely normal. I imagine if you looked into his internet history you'd find he spends a lot of time in incel spaces online. Those sort of spaces are \"crab buckets\"- essentially an echo chamber where the members constantly negatively reinforce each other to ensure that no one ever escapes their self imposed hells. To put it bluntly, Geoffrey needs help. Badly. As is often the situation in these kinds of things, his obsession with high schoolers is projection. He claims that other people peaked in high school, and tells *actual* current high schoolers that they will be losers as adults because that is true of himself; whatever it was he suffered in high school, he still views that as the \"peak\" version of himself and it's all gone downhill since. He accuses others of being stuck in high school because *he* is. He never got over high school and likely feels that the whole course of his life was ruined during it.   \n\nI'm gonna level with you here; your brother fully immersed in a very dangerous and destructive way of thinking, not only for himself but for people around him as well. He needs to be in therapy again, and not whoever he saw in the past because they clearly did not help. Inceldom is an ideology that blames women, \"good looking people\", sexual liberation, and whatever aspect of themselves the incel in question is insecure about for the fact that they can't find a romantic partner/have sex, and in turn blame that for *everything* that is wrong with their lives. Needless to say, it also comes with a heavy dose of extreme misogyny and misanthropy in general. At \"best\" for the people around them they're just perpetually miserable and caustic without being a danger. At worst, they become sexual predators or spree killers targeting whichever group (typically women) they feel is most \"at fault\" for their suffering.", "I have now, that update hadn't been posted yet when I wrote the initial comment.", "Right?

Your family seems not to understand the gravity of his situation. It's not *just* that Geoffrey will end up alone if things don't change, that's a given with incels. It's deeper than that. His attitude towards other people is a problem at best, and could make him a danger to others if he ever becomes that far gone. The worst of the incel community actively praise the ones who end up harming others. I know this may sound dramatic, but I really want to make it clear that this goes far deeper than your brother just having had a bad experience with high school and never getting over it (and frankly, even if that *was* the extent of it, I assume he graduated at 17 or 18 which was roughly *half his lifetime ago*, so that's still pretty damn bad to still be obsessed over).", "It refers to the, \"I'm a nice guy you ugly fucking bitch!\" type of guy, the ones who bemoan the fact that they're alone because \"nice guys finish last\" even though they're objectively awful people without the self awareness to realize that they are far from a nice guy."]}
