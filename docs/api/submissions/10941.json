Chest pains with hypertension aren't a joke. I know it's expensive, but next time please, please, please go to ER or an urgent care facility. Also schedule an appointment with your doctor **NOW**. You very well might have had a minor heart attack. Do not put this off. I am deadly serious. This could be the difference between you living a few more years or not. \n\nAs for your husband, not only did he leave you, but he got drunk. That is so many levels of not OK. Once he is sober, you need to have a very frank conversation. Focus on how his abandoning you made you feel and avoid attacking him so he won't shut down/tune out. Also this would be a great time to schedule couple's counseling. And finally, have your doctor explain to him exactly why you absolutely should not have been alone with chest pains.", "NTA.

If you are having medical issues it is not ok to wander over to the neighbours for a few hours of drinking.", "NTA. Your husband does not care about you even the slightest little bit.

A thoughtful partner/spouse would remain with you to be responsive to any sudden changes in your condition.", "NTA.  You could have died.  You asked him to stay with you.

I can't imagine leaving hubby with chest pains.  \n\nMy hubby let me go to the ER in an Uber with a medication reaction but we knew it was a medication reaction and that I just needed to be watched.
