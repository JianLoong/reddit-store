All this time, our families have come to know each other through word of mouth only. Despite living only a few miles away, we've never met in person \n\nI don't \u201ddislike\u201d James, but neither am I a fan. He's okay most of the time, but *sometimes* he treats Jaelinn poorly. He's short-tempered with her, he orders her around too much, and he often speaks to her in a condescending tone. Perhaps equally disturbing, his attitudes toward just about everything are radically right-wing\n\nHe's not a \"bad\" person per se; he just has an unpleasant disposition imo (most of the time) and is my polar opposite. Jaelinn is nothing like him, either. I guess it's true that opposites attract\n\nThrough all this, my biggest problem with him is his attitude toward my son \u201cDevon,\u201d who's bisexual. James never has said anything overtly hateful, but his phobias are obvious (rolling his eyes or snickering under his breath when he thinks no one's looking). He says he isn't *against* the lifestyle, but he doesn't *believe* in it. When I asked him why, he said, \u201cIt's hard to explain\u201d\n\nMy daughter, for better or worse, is highly suggestible. She's also a very easygoing individual who defers to him more often than she should\n\nA few weeks ago, James told me he was planning to propose to Jaelinn on Valentine's Day and wanted to invite his family for the event. Naturally, I thought it would be wonderful for everyone to be in attendance, so I agreed. \n\nBut the last few weeks have been pure hell. The first remark: \u201cBe sure you don't turn on the television while my parents are here.\u201d Followed by, \u201cDon't serve store-brand chips or soda for snacks.\u201d \u201cDon't correct my parents' grammar.\u201d \u201cMake sure the bathroom is clean\u201d... \n\nIt's been one thing after another. I finally said, \u201cLook, you're starting to piss me off. How much of a moron do you think I am? Do you think I've never entertained before?\u201d He laughed it off, saying he was just nervous and that he didn't mean to offend. ***But he didn't stop***\n\nLast night after dinner, he pulled me aside and said, \u201cOne more thing. You *will* make sure Devon doesn't \u2018go off the deep end\u2019 in front of my parents? You know... make sure he doesn't act *too* gay\u201d\n\nThat was it\u2014the proverbial last straw. I lost my temper, revoked the invitation, and told him to find somewhere else to propose \n\nThis threw the whole house into an uproar, and there was no way to avoid Jaelinn finding out about it. She was ***furious*** with me. She said James changed his mind about proposing to her altogether and that it was all *my* fault. She said I \u201cruined her life\u201d\n\nAt first, Devon supported me and so did half our family. Now even Devon says I should have kept my mouth shut and put up with it a little bit longer\n\nAITA for ruining my daughter's surprise proposal?\n\n**Update:** She's still not speaking to me. I saw them bring some boxes up from the basement, so I think my worst fear is being realized. If she moves out with him, I don't know what I'll do. I won't be able to protect her at all :(\n\n**Info:** This happens to me all the time, so I should have made it clear: I'm Mom, not Dad. \"Dad,\" and I use that term loosely, is an abusive jerk who abandoned the family 8 years ago\n\n**Thank you** to everyone for your expressions of sympathy and encouragement. Yes, there's a chunk of YTA votes out there, and I get it. But for those of you voting NTA and offering your well-wishes, it means so much to me.

How much putting up and shutting up would be need OK with?", "His entire behavior surrounding the proposal should be a red flag.  There was a lot more going on than just his comment about \u201crein in the gay\u201d. He\u2019s a control freak. And he very clearly told you that he thinks he has more of a say in how your household is ran than you do. He spent how long ordering you around ffs!  He thinks you are incompetent and only he can properly plan and execute something as simple as hosting family for a day. He acts like he\u2019s the head of house hold and you just pay his bills. He sounds like an insufferable asshat. And a major control freak.  \n\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t tell your daughter how you feel or that she can\u2019t marry him.  You have to tread very carefully here or you\u2019ll just end up doing exactly what James is hoping for- that your daughter will choose him and cut you off. Controlling men like him don\u2019t want partners who have strong relationships with their parents. It makes them harder to manipulate when they have a strong support system.  So make sure your daughter knows that no matter what you\u2019ll always be there for her and nothing she can do will change that.  But somehow you need to let her know that you will not tolerate James behavior to you and Devon any longer. He doesn\u2019t get to disrespect you, your home, or your children.  Do what you can to ensure that you maintain contact with her, even if it\u2019s through Devon- which, hopefully he also sees James for what he is as well. She\u2019ll need his support and maybe even honesty if she\u2019s ever going to wake up to what a terrible partner James is. I went through something similar with my brother when he was around your daughters age. He was dating an abusive woman who he was infatuated with. My parents had to cut him off financially and did not hold back when telling him how ducked up his relationship was. He did go no contact with them for a while- he had too. His fianc\u00e9 made him choose and he also wouldn\u2019t believe our parents were right and he was angry and too deep in the FOG (fear obligation guilt). I am not that close with him (and never did meet this woman) but close enough that he still would talk to me.  I got updates from his bff who also was trying to get my brother out of that relationship because he actually saw the abuse first hand, so I had an idea of what was happening. I was finally able to talk to him in private one night, and I just made him listen (and I think he did because I had no real stake in his life and wasn\u2019t as\u2026 strict? and all up in his business as my parents) and I told him about my experiences and what his future would look like if he married her, what \u201cstarting over\u201d looked like that how it wasn\u2019t the end of the world and reminded him of his family and that nothing had changed. Your daughter may need her brother when she\u2019s starting to have doubts about James and to remind her that she has a family who is there and will help her and that she\u2019s still young and what her future could look like. It\u2019s different than hearing it from a parent- they won\u2019t have all their defenses up or prepared to fight back and they can\u2019t claim a sibling close to their age doesn\u2019t understand. You may want to start with having a serious conversation with Devon \n\nI hope for your daughters sake something opens her eyes before she marries this jerk.", "The daughter is going to run after the fascist, so not to an extent, she's in all the way.", "But she\u2019s being a real asshole now. She can\u2019t say she\u2019s not a homophone when she\u2019s with a guy like James.", "She says that she had a SO that was abusive, so I think that she's unfortunately tainted by her own experiences and possible scales of abuse. Which is very sad honestly.", "I apparently missed the fact he moved in and was living there with the daughter.\n\nMom needs to boot them both", "Not the Blitzkrieg analogy lmao, too accurate \ud83d\ude02", "If it were me, the later would be an easy choice.", "Or, you take the hard-line approach that my parents used with my brother and his Ex, and he moves out anyways and gets abused and financially taken advantage of for 3 years because the Ex convinced him to go NC, and isolated him from them.  The only reason we were able to get him out of there, was I didn't fully condemn (out loud, to him) the guy, and when things got REALLY bad, I drove over there and basically kidnapped my brother.  He twisted my parents concerns about him as homophobia, and my brother went along with it.  Completely broke my parents to see snide comments accusing them of homophobia on social media.\n\nSometimes, when you know you're not getting through, you gotta do what you can to maintain contact so you can keep tabs on what's going on, even if it's killing you inside.", "Exactly.  He\u2019s now treated both the daughter and mother like he\u2019s \u201cthe man of the house\u201d which is bad enough on it\u2019s own, but even worse when it\u2019s their house, not his.  This, along with the homophobia that triggered this situation are some great big flashing red lights.", "He doesn't love her, he loves that he can control her, and you.

Do you understand that you are serving her, yourself and your son up on a silver platter to a toxic, abusive AH who will only get more controlling if they get married?

Your daughter may not see it now, but it's a blessing in disguise that he isn't proposing. The funny thing about a proposal is that it marks the beginning of a lifetime with that asshole, not only for your daughter, but everyone in the family. This disrespectful behavior is only destined to get worse for everyone involved, and I hope your daughter sees this behavior for what it is. It may take time, but maybe your son could have a heart-to-heart with her once the dust settles, when king jackass isn't around to cloud her judgment, so she can understand that his words and actions have hurtful consequences for the people she loves, and who want the best for her. \n\nI wish your family all the peace you deserve, and hope their relationship implodes before anything is set in stone.

Push back on them imo.", "One of the best suggestions I've seen for dealing with this crap is to act all innocent yet serious and politely ask them to explain why the 'joke' is funny.

To go even further, he probably has a crush on Devon. Homophobia does that to people. Especially someone who is ONLY 25 having grown up in a severely right wing environment. The reason he is scared of Devon\u2019s bisexuality is because he\u2019s scared of his own. \n\nSo you did the right thing and are a good mom. Absolutely NTA.

But I honesty struggle to understand why. It seems like she already knew about the proposal so it wasn\u2019t actually a surprise. More of a staged event. Which doesn\u2019t have to be staged. Or happen at any specific moment. If they truly love each other, they can propose at Harveys and use an onion ring. \n\nBesides, she should defend her brother. If she thinks that \u2018lifestyle\u2019 is an appropriate synonym for sexual orientation, maybe she should go back in time a few decades to when that was still considered acceptable. Sexual Orientation is NOT a choice nor a lifestyle. It is simply how our brains are wired. So with basic fact in mind, James is asking Devon to be something he\u2019s not. Do you think this abuse would stop after they get married? HELL NO. \n\nHonestly, if this ends up causing them to not propose, you will have done them a favour.

It took me until my 30s to really learn that just because I had the ability to stop the shouting, didn't mean I had the *responsibility* to do so. Back at his age, I would have said the same thing to you that he did, for want of peace and harmony: I would have removed myself to quiet down the people who won't accept my very existence, rather than force everyone else to put up with the fallout. And every time I did so I was denying the validity who I am, internalising that I was less worthy of space for being myself than the abusers were for hating me. \n\nDevon's trying to keep the peace by allowing James to grind him down, because James will throw a tantrum if he's not allowed to. Devon sounds like a good kid, it's a selfless thing to do because he loves his family - but for his own wellbeing and for everyone else like him, and like me, he's making the wrong call.

She'll start to forget who she is and what she enjoys doing. She'll give up hobbies because he tells her they're a waste of time or money. He'll berate her taste in tv, or books, or music, or decor.
