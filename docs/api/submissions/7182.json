All this time, our families have come to know each other through word of mouth only. Despite living only a few miles away, we've never met in person \n\nI don't \u201ddislike\u201d James, but neither am I a fan. He's okay most of the time, but *sometimes* he treats Jaelinn poorly. He's short-tempered with her, he orders her around too much, and he often speaks to her in a condescending tone. Perhaps equally disturbing, his attitudes toward just about everything are radically right-wing\n\nHe's not a \"bad\" person per se; he just has an unpleasant disposition imo (most of the time) and is my polar opposite. Jaelinn is nothing like him, either. I guess it's true that opposites attract\n\nThrough all this, my biggest problem with him is his attitude toward my son \u201cDevon,\u201d who's bisexual. James never has said anything overtly hateful, but his phobias are obvious (rolling his eyes or snickering under his breath when he thinks no one's looking). He says he isn't *against* the lifestyle, but he doesn't *believe* in it. When I asked him why, he said, \u201cIt's hard to explain\u201d\n\nMy daughter, for better or worse, is highly suggestible. She's also a very easygoing individual who defers to him more often than she should\n\nA few weeks ago, James told me he was planning to propose to Jaelinn on Valentine's Day and wanted to invite his family for the event. Naturally, I thought it would be wonderful for everyone to be in attendance, so I agreed. \n\nBut the last few weeks have been pure hell. The first remark: \u201cBe sure you don't turn on the television while my parents are here.\u201d Followed by, \u201cDon't serve store-brand chips or soda for snacks.\u201d \u201cDon't correct my parents' grammar.\u201d \u201cMake sure the bathroom is clean\u201d... \n\nIt's been one thing after another. I finally said, \u201cLook, you're starting to piss me off. How much of a moron do you think I am? Do you think I've never entertained before?\u201d He laughed it off, saying he was just nervous and that he didn't mean to offend. ***But he didn't stop***\n\nLast night after dinner, he pulled me aside and said, \u201cOne more thing. You *will* make sure Devon doesn't \u2018go off the deep end\u2019 in front of my parents? You know... make sure he doesn't act *too* gay\u201d\n\nThat was it\u2014the proverbial last straw. I lost my temper, revoked the invitation, and told him to find somewhere else to propose \n\nThis threw the whole house into an uproar, and there was no way to avoid Jaelinn finding out about it. She was ***furious*** with me. She said James changed his mind about proposing to her altogether and that it was all *my* fault. She said I \u201cruined her life\u201d\n\nAt first, Devon supported me and so did half our family.

I think what you did was the right thing, but I may be hard for everyone to see that right now.\n\nEdit: I see you mentioned your daughter is on the spectrum, and so am I. I think my Autism made it harder for me to notice the red flags and harder for me to speak up when I was being mistreated.

He couldn't come with an answer and eventually said that it was just too hard to explain\n\nI think he was just using the wrong word. He didn't mean to say that he doesn't believe in it, he meant to say that he doesn't support it\n\nBy the way, when this conversation took place, it was around the time of the Pride Parade when I was making plans for us to attend.
