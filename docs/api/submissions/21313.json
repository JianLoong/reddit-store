Since he\u2019s been back he\u2019s been sleeping in the living room. Before he left his bedroom was in the basement, and while he was gone his older sister (22f) took it over. \n\nNow that his older sister has moved out, he wants his old room In the basement back. When he was a teenager and he first moved down there that\u2019s when all the trouble started. \n\nHe started to become more \u201csneaky\u201d. He \nstarted getting in trouble at school, and even with the law before actually being charged with something. There\u2019s a door in our basement that leads to outside. So he was leaving out without anyone knowing, and we even found out from neighbors that he was sneaking all kinds of people in and out of our home. \n\nWhen his older sister first wanted to move down there, we had to clean it out first we found all sorts of illegal stuff down there that belonged to him. So when he asked to move back down there that\u2019s why I told him no, because I couldn\u2019t trust him and I didn\u2019t want him to go back down that path. Now he\u2019s upset with me, he says he needs his own space to get back on his feet. \n\nHe says I\u2019m being unfair by \u201cforcing\u201d him to sleep on the sofa when there\u2019s a room for him, especially since all his siblings have a room. He thinks I should trust him because that was years ago and he\u2019s changed. \n\nI do get where he\u2019s coming from and I do feel bad that he\u2019s sleeping on the sofa, but I can\u2019t just forget about last time he lived in the basement and I can\u2019t risk him going down that path again.

I told him no and he thinks I\u2019m being unfair because he\u2019s sleeping on the sofa, but I can\u2019t trust him living down there and again and I don\u2019t want him to go down that path.", "created_utc": 1688478080, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qfju1/aita_for_not_letting_my_son_move_back_in_the/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you are doing it out of love and concern, which is good. \n\nBUT having said that, I\u2019d like to offer another perspective. I work with kids (11-21) who are incarcerated, getting them treatment and getting them set up with continued services in their communities when they go home. I work with youth with backgrounds similar to your son everyday and it\u2019s an eye opening experience. Most of these kids, when they go home, really want to live differently and feel differently than before and they\u2019re struggling to hold on to the coping skills they\u2019ve learned along their way back home. One of the most helpful skills our youth learn is knowing when to walk away and take a minute to calm down and to reflect before reacting. Your son doesn\u2019t have that, or any kind of private place, he can retreat to and is forced to live in what\u2019s most likely the most high traffic area of the house. That is stressful for many reasons, and also probably keeps your son \u201con guard\u201d because he\u2019s been so used to sharing his space with others that he may or may not trust for years. \n\nI do think your son deserves a space to go to when he needs silence or a minute alone or a feeling of security. It doesn\u2019t have to be the basement, but if you don\u2019t want it to be the basement, I do think you should try to figure something else out. The current situation is not sustainable and will likely only add to your sons struggle to readjust to a life where he\u2019s not locked up.", "INFO: Would another sibling want the basement, so you could then offer him his own space in the house?  It is your house at the end of the day, but getting him out of the living room might be a nice gesture.", "NTA\n\nTell him he's a guest until he can get his own place. He can prove he's changed by \"getting back on his feet\" and finding somewhere else to live.", "NTA,   but he does he need a private space.  If the other kids are out of their rooms now, why can't he use one of those?", "INFO: Could you block that door outside? Or change rooms so some of his siblings gets the basement and he gets his sibling's room?", "NTA, don't ignore your own concerns. He's lucky to even have the couch if you ask me. Actions have consequences.", "NAH\n\nBut isn't there a compromise? I can see why he doesn't want to sleep on the sofa, especially when there's a whole room available! Can't you shuffle the other rooms around and at least give him a room?", "NTA. He needs to earn your trust again but I would lay out plan for him to get back into a room (if that\u2019s what you want). It\u2019s none of my business but maybe monthly drug tests/attendance to some employment help program.", "NTA. Let him show you that he's actually changed before you change up any rules for him.", "NTA your house your rules.", "NTA\n\nYour house your rules, if they don't like it you can legally kick them out.\n\nI understand what he is saying about a sofa and bed not being the same thing but maybe this will motivate him to get his own place.\n\nHe lost a lot of privileges when he was incarcerated by lying to you about what he was doing. That stuff doesn't happen because you stole a sweet from a candy store.", "NTA\nIt\u2019s your house and you have no obligation to let your son live there at all. Explain to him that he has broken your trust and he has to earn it back before he can sleep in the basement. Then put a Ring camera on the basement door so that once he does start sleeping in the basement again, you can monitor the camera to see if he is sneaking out.", "NTA - Only you guys know him.", "NTA. Your son should be reminded that it\u2019s YOUR house and therefore it\u2019s a privilege for him to stay there at all, as he is both an adult and ex-convict. It doesn\u2019t mean you love your son any less (tough love is still love) or that you\u2019ve given up on him, in fact you\u2019re still providing a place to stay. That being said, I don\u2019t think the ban from the basement necessarily has to be permanent. If he is remorseful for his past, earns back trust and demonstrates improvements, I don\u2019t see why he couldn\u2019t move back there in the future, and maybe that\u2019s the solution. Lay out what he has to do to earn trust and for how long, and let his actions speak for themselves. I used to be like your son. I needed more tough love than I received and it delayed me getting my shit together.", "Info: is there a program available to help him avoid recidivism and live on his own?  \n\nI don\u2019t think he should be at your house since he had problems while living there before. He may need support from people who have the skills to help him move on to better things.", "NTA I think there should be a path to more independence for your son but that\u2019s something you have to figure out", "I'm guessing if as a juvenile he spent 4 years inside, what he did was fairly serious. I also get that when you get out of prison it's difficult to find your feet again especially with a record. NTA whatever you decide, you are in a really tough spot.", "What's missing from here is whether your son has truly changed and deserves the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIf you don't think he has, why is he in your house at all?\n\nI would suggest certain criteria need to be met before he's trusted to return to the basement. You're allowed to place conditions on what you will require of him before he's allowed to live in the basement. For instance, he must have a job and pay rent.\n\nThis also bothers me:\n\n>Now he\u2019s upset with me, he says he needs his own space to get back on his feet.\n\nNo, he doesn't. He has shelter from the weather, a place to sleep on, food, etc. Not having his own separate bedroom does not prevent him from getting a job, saving his money and finding his own space. This is an attempt at manipulation, not a legitimate need.\n\nI vote NTA. You have every right not to trust him and require him to earn your trust.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, be prepared for a deluge of Y-T-As. In this subreddit, children can do no wrong and parents can do no right.\n\nOne of the more outrageous accounts in this subreddit is how a daughter, conned by her father, systematically and over a period of years, excised her mother completely from her life. Including a time at a custody hearing when she testified against her mother, calling her an embarrassment and how ashamed she was of her mother and how her mother couldn't afford to buy her nice presents.\n\nSo, after years of her daughter's relentless and cruel treatment, her mother resigned herself to the fact that her daughter was dead to her, moved on, started a new life and made a new family, complete with husband and two kids. Then, lo and behold, guess who calls her after eight years of total silence. After a year of occasional superficial conversation over the phone, the daughter suddenly invites herself to spend Christmas with her mother's new family. Which was three days away.\n\nHer mother, quite reasonably, said no. She hasn't had any meaningful contact with her daughter for eight years. And out of that entire household, three out of four people don't even know this daughter. And the OP doesn't really know her anymore either.\n\nPredictably, daughter had a meltdown and called her mother all kinds of names, which basically proves that the mother was right to refuse her demand.\n\nYou would not believe the fury that this subreddit devolved into. \"Oh, how ***daaaaaaaaare*** you refuse to have your daughter over for Christmas! You invite her over right ***now, now, now*** and kiss her feet and beg her forgiveness!\"\n\n\"Oh, tee-hee-hee! If we were all disowned by our parents every time we said, 'I hate you, Mom!' we'd all be orphans!\"\n\nTotally downplayed the size of the ask: 1. spending Christmas is an overnight stay, so, they're looking at probably three days, two nights minimum; 2. three out of four people in that household don't even know the daughter, and they're expected to spend their holiday with a total stranger. 3. These kids are small children, and they're being expected to have an adult that they don't even know, that no one in the house knows, really, over for their holiday.\n\nAnd they totally downplayed the lengths the daughter went through to alienate her mom: 1. It wasn't a simple one-time, \"I hate you, mom!\" It was addressing her mother by her first name, and calling her stepmother \"Mom,\" in front of her. It was telling a judge that she couldn't stand to be with her mom, because \"Mommy can't buy me the nice presents I deserve!\"  2. This ongoing campaign by the daughter, spurred on by her father, lasted years. ***Years.*** And the kids in this forum act like it was a one-time, \"I hate you, Mommy.\"\n\nThe OP had resigned herself to the fact that her daughter was gone forever. That is what she had to do to move on to find some happiness for herself in the face of overwhelming heartbreak. But again, there is no unforgivable sin that a child can commit in this forum. And parents are required to just love, love, love, love, love, and aren't allowed to have boundaries or feelings. Parents must love unconditionally and eternally, even in the face of an ongoing campaign, over a period of years, to alienate a parent, but a child's love can be predicated on not getting nice toys.\n\nIn short, go a parenting sub. You are facing universal condemnation here.", "NTA but kinda? The basement isnt going to cause him to start doing stupid shit again. The basement also isnt the reason he started doing stupid shit but it did allow him to do more of it. He was probably up to stuff and around the wrong crowd beforehand.\n\nGiving him his own space can help him get a better start to his life. Hes already had no privacy or space to himself for the last 4 years. Hes done his time. Should he continue to be punished?\nThis could lead to resentment from him.\n\nInstead of saying \"no i dont trust you\" why dont you use the room to encourage a better path. Ask him to attend some kind of counseling and as well he needs to either finish his schooling or find some kind of work.", "You are being unfair. He's sleeping in what is essentially a public area of your house because you won't make a bedroom space available to him. Even though his older sister has moved out, and a bedroom space is available, you will neither let him use it, nor move one of your other children into it so that he can move into their bedroom. Unless of course you want his stay with you to be as short as possible, in which case tell him that. He deserves honesty.\n\nYou know the situation better than us, so there's a reasonable chance that you can make a well informed decision about his risks that we can't. You have to decide if you think he's changed, but also remember changes only stick with appropriate support. You're generosity providing food and accommodation and I'm sure he's grateful to that, but he needs mentoring. He needs assistance with learning all the things about becoming an adult that he would have learned if he hadn't messed up earlier. Emotional regulation, anger management, cooking, cleaning, sewing on buttons, financial management etc. Maybe you can get him to enrol in some community courses on these sorts of things in addition to what you can teach him.\n\nYou're NTA for being wary of trusting him, but you have other options to leaving him on the couch, which you should explore.", "YTA, either swap his room with a sibling or put a ring camera outside the basement door. People need privacy. You're just going to push him out to find his own space and I bet it will be with less than ideal people as he will be desperate.", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t the basement that sent him down that path. It may have made it easier to go further down that road, but he was already on it. Also, he was a teen then. He is an adult now. Coming and going on his own is okay.\n\nFinally, if he has changed and is trying to make better choices, treating him like this will send him the wrong direction. He needs as much positive encouragement as he can get.", "Mouth he doesn\u2019t like it he can always move out. Don\u2019t do the crime if you can\u2019t do the time", "YTA\n\nIf you trust him enough to allow him to live with the family,  he should have his own room.  It's like you're still punishing him for his past mistakes.", "I get that it allowed him to easily get away with illegal activity, but he is an adult now and already did his time. By not letting him in the basement your punishing him for something he was being punished for during the past four years. He needs your help to get back on his feet and he also needs a proper place to sleep which doesn't include a sofa. YTA", "Anyone else want to know what the hell this kid did to be locked up for 4 years? And what illegal things they found?", "YTA You want your son fail. Your son was locked up for 4 years that changes most people. If your saying in the time your son has been back in the real world he hasn\u2019t shown he has changed? I think not they don\u2019t let people who haven\u2019t changed out of jail and if his behavior was the same or worse while he was doing his time they would of extended it. I\u2019m not saying he can\u2019t revert back to old ways but it seems very unlikely. Instead of still treating your son like a child and like he\u2019s still a prisoner this could be a good opportunity to get him back on the right path.

I mean people are sexually assaulted, harassed, attacked - sleeping out in the open like this could be unbearable and emotionally painful for him and if you care enough about him to house him, I would think you would care enough about him to not want to cause him pain. \n\nLastly, he was arrested at 16. Imo, when a kid is arrested, their parents are almost always partially at fault. You admit that he was getting at trouble in school and even legally - did you get him therapy? Did you try moving schools? Did you do anything back then to try and help him? \n\nI feel like you think if you had moved him out the basement back then, none of this would\u2019ve ever happened so you\u2019re overreacting now.

Why does wanting some privacy after being locked up now mean he has to move out?\n\nBecause he abused his parent's trust (I don't know if OP is the mother or father), and left a cache of illegal items in the basement when he was arrested, which could have probably gotten the parent arrested as well if the police ever searched that basement. And the fact that he also placed his siblings in danger just by having contraband in the home.\n\nTo say nothing of the fact that he was inviting total strangers who were into whatever shitty dealings OP's son was involved in, placing both the parent and underage siblings in danger.\n\nThe OP is lucky they weren't arrested themselves, and the kids placed in foster care.\n\nYou don't get to put your entire family at risk like that and expect to return home and think you're going to be trusted!

We already know that OP's son is willing to place both his parent and underage siblings at serious risk.\n\nBasically, it sounds like the kid was into serious drugs. And we're not talking about just some pot, since he spent four years in prison. So, assuming this is drug-related, he's been inviting some drug-users into the home, getting high.\n\nWhile his ten-year-old sister is sound asleep upstairs.\n\nDoubtless OP's son is on probation with the law. He can also be on probation at home. The whole purpose of probation is to prove you can be trusted (and to turn you into a cash cow for the state; I'm not naive). OP has no reason to trust his son at this point. He has to earn it, just like he has to earn it with the law."]}
