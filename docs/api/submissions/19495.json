No, my dear\u2026. there\u2019s no food in your fridge because you did not *put* any food in your fridge. \n\nIt\u2019s not a self-replenishing resource OP is stealing from or a service OP is providing. \n\nThis calls for a real sit-down chat with roommate to establish expectations and boundaries.\n\n\u201c*Based on your comments about the fridge, it seems like you have an expectation that groceries are shared or that I am supposed to provide you with food. Would you agree that is your expectation?\u201d*\n\nIf she says \u201cno,\u201d then, \u201c*I\u2019m glad that\u2019s settled. We are each responsible for our own food.

I have communicated to you on numerous occasions before that I don\u2019t appreciate you eating my food. What led you to have this expectation, and why didn\u2019t you take me seriously when I asked you to stop? Please expect that the only things you will ever eat while at home or from the fridge will be things you have purchased and brought in yourself.\u201d*\n\nI find this to be *such* a common issue in people living away from home for the first time.  People often expect to have to clean up or buy toiletries or do dishes, but for some reason basic sustenance being available is just such an ingrained expectation that it doesn\u2019t occur to people that if they do not purchase things to put in the house to eat.. there will not be food in the house to eat.  \n\nBut by 24 this should not be an issue. Even if they just moved away from home, by that age you should be contributing and be at least aware of the cost and effort involved in stocking a home with food.

It stands to reason that these behaviors aren't even remotely new, and they began to show themselves when it was the parents job to nip it in the bud. \n\nTake the TP and trashcan problem.
