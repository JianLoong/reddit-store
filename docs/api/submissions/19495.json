I will even put a huge sticker on it with my name right on where the package opens and it will be ripped. I've asked her to stop but she never does. I've already put my non refrigerated food in my room which bothered her. She eats out for the majority of her meals and when she is home decides to eat my food so she hardly shops. I pay the electric bill because I work from home and keep the AC on all day so it's not like she has to pay for more energy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other issue is the trash in our bathroom. Somehow she fills that trashcan up fully to the point that it's bulging out and spilling onto the floor every day. Outside of doing that she is pretty clean. The morning will start with a fresh bag then she gets ready and it's 2/3 full with seemingly unused toilet paper, wipes, cotton swaps, and other things. So much toilet paper is in the trash during the day that she will go through half a 24 pack in a few days. But we each pay for our own so I don't really care. When I lived with my friend(m same age as me) we would maybe have to take out the bathroom trash 2-3 times a month if that. And a 24 pack of quality TP would last a month and some change. It's to the point that I've stopped using the bathroom trash all together. I got a small trash can, put it in the corner of my closet, and every time I just carry stuff over from the bathroom to my room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe complained that the bathroom trash was full and I told her \"that's all you. I haven't used that in days\" and showed her my trash can I use in my room. This bothered her and she said I was being a petty asshole. It was during this that she saw the mini fridge/freezer in my room and said \"so that's why there's no food!\" I hadn't looked in the main fridge for like 2 weeks but when I did check recently there was some expired milk, bread, guacamole and takeout containers. I told her that it's my food and she never gives me money to get any.

We actually had to share a room and she would eat all my snacks. She would also let her friends do the same too. I'd walk in and there were her friends on my side of the room eating, throwing wrappers every where and eating it all on my bed while getting crumbs on every thing.\n\nSometimes there would be \"bite marks\" on my food and then put back. Or bags opened and not finished. I finally stopped bringing snacks to the room. \n\nShe also was using all my toiletries too. I started noticing that all my health and beauty products and my make up were going down at a fast rate. I figured it out when I really looked at her make up and noticed that she's wearing my eye shadow and I noticed that my toothpaste, shampoo, soap, feminine protection and deodorant was going down at alarming rates. \n\nI had asked her numerous times to stop eating my snacks. To stop allowing her friends to eat my snacks. To please not have her friends hang out on my bed. To stop using my toiletries! \n\nHer excuses were really lame such as \"Well, they are already here. I am just using what is in front of me.\" Explaining that they were not hers to use was pointless.\n\nI discovered that we had some 24 hr lockers near the gym that I was allowed to use. I literally held all my snacks and toiletries there. Within the first 24 hours, she was in a panic about snacks, toothpaste, deodorant, makeup, hand soap, shampoo, etc.. She asked me about it all and I told her that I no longer will be providing her with MY items. I was on a limited budget and she could easily shop for these things because she had a car and had a monthly allowance from her family.\n\nShe huffed and walked away. While she did end up buying her toiletries but I was emptying them out little by little any time I used the bathroom just for petty revenge! \n\nTrust me when I say that she deserved that as she got worse as a roommate after that!", "NTA.

Did she think refrigerators got magically stocked by the elves.\n\nI think you might be cutting off your nose to spite your face regarding the bathroom trash though. I would find it very inconvenient to have to carry everything into my bedroom instead of tossing it in the bathroom trash. So that my life was more simple, I would just get good plastic liners and toss the trash periodically especially since you are home working so presumably are using the bathroom frequently - I mean tampons and napkins and other sanitary products - who wants to carry and store them in your bedroom just to make a point?", "NTA.
