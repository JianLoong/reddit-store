The donkey didn't attack the child,  he reacted to being \"attacked\" by a child whose parents failed to teach their children to be respectful of animals. \n\nAlso,  a broken nose & a few stitches that, ultimately,  resulted from (forgive me) horseplay don't actually merit the death penalty.\n\nI hope the little one is healing well.  She can be told \"The donkey is in \"time out\" for being so grumpy but we should have told you that he doesn't like hugs and gets scared when people run at him\"", "NTA\n\nBut your donkey is better at teaching your brother's kids manners than him", "NTA. Your brother's daughter learned a very easy lesson the hard way. That's on your brother for not teaching his kids about respecting animals. Hope no gets guilted into putting the donkey down.", "If you want to show someone that they matter, you don't do it by killing something else as a comparison.\n\nAside from that, you are also correct that the brother should have taught her proper animal handling and safety like he would with any other potentially-dangerous situation. That's why he's the parent.\n\nNTA", "Your brother and his wife are 100% to blame for not telling their daughter the rules, nor enforcing them. That donkey didn't try to commit premeditated murder\u2014it reacted instinctively when spooked, like a normal animal would. Killing the donkey solves nothing.\n\nNTA", "NTA feel bad for the kid but she learned a life long lesson that animals are not stuffed toys", " NTA I have a small farm. This is why I don\u2019t have children come here. Animals are NOT toys. Period. Lifelong animal lover. I engaged MANY animals in my long life. My parents were fine with this, as long as I 1) Asked the owner if I could pet the animal( and accepted what they said) 2) Showed SENSE in my behavior. Never been bit as I followed these rules into adulthood. You did the right thing and I hope the donkey is ok!", "NTA It sucks she got hurt but the donkey didn\u2019t cause any permanent damage. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but the parents for not talking  to their kid about farm safety.Poor donkey just got scared he doesn\u2019t deserve to die over an accident.", "NTA, this situation reminds me of buckbeak from harry potter. It's not your niece's fault tho, your brother should have warned her.", "As a mom myself, NTA. Your brother is being ridiculous. Your brother needs to teach the kids how to respect animals and stay out of their personal space. I hope he doesn\u2019t have dogs as they also are not playground equipment and if something happens when being hung on, it\u2019s the kid(s) and/or parent(s) fault for not being smart enough to prevent the occurrence in the first place. \n\nSome people shouldn\u2019t be allowed near animals.", "NTA - But it's not the nieces fault, this boils down to bad parenting. She should have been taught and known what to do and what not to do well before being let near an animal.\n\nThe donkey reacted as any farm animal not used to small humans would, it did nothing wrong.", "NTA - when you fuck around you find out", " Nope. Nta. I hope nothing happens to the donkey!", "NTA, and neither is the donkey. This was your brother's failure to parent, not an animal having any vicious propensity or any taste of blood to turn into a vicious propensity.", "NTA. After 15 years, your brother knew this donkey's temperament. To a donkey, this would have seemed like an attack and needed to defend himself. \n\nYes, the niece's safety is tantamount, but this wasn't a petting zoo. Where the hell was your brother to allow his daughter to run up to this animal? This happened because the parent didn't protect the child. \n\nYour brother and his wife are overreacting because they didn't protect their own child. If anyone is the AH, it is your brother.", "NTA. I have always taught children that animals can't say the word \"no\".  They will do what they have to, bite, kick, etc.  It's your brother's fault. Demanding the donkey be put down is cruel.", "I was already NTA before I read the rest and now I'm even more NTA... \"Showing the daughter she's more valuable than the donkey\" isn't the right solution, it's irrelevant here. Dad accepting responsibility for not guiding her is.\n\nThis is a LIFE of an animal that is docile when you respect its space. Taking that life to prove a useless point is beyond unethical.", "NTA\n\nThe donkey should not be put down for defending itself and establishing boundaries. Not all animals are friendly with kids or certain people and your brother and his family need to respect that. If your brother and his wife were actually parenting their kids then the incident would not have happened.", "Put down the donkey? Then tell the child the donkey, that she loved, had to die to teach her that she matters? Way to traumatize the poor kid for life! I hope they don\u2019t do this.", "NTA. We shouldn't kill animals that have firm boundaries and react when those boundaries are crossed.  Especially when those boundaries have been identified and respected for a long time and they didn't kill anyone.", "NTA \n\nThis is no different than a kid running up to a dog or cat they don't know , pulling their tail , whiskers , chasing them , etc . I honestly cannot stand parents who don't teach their kids to respect animals , and then blame said animal because the animal reacted in a rather normal way . It sucked that happened to your niece , but her parents , one should have been with her , and two should have told her about the donkey so then she wouldn't have spooked him . I've seen several kids capable of being able to be quiet , and not be outburst like if someone tells them they need to be quiet and gentle .", "NAH. It is understandable that you feel attached to the donkey and do not want it to be put down. However, it is important to acknowledge that the safety and well-being of your niece is paramount. In this situation, it seems that everyone involved could have taken more responsibility to prevent the accident from occurring. Your brother and his wife should have warned their children about the donkey and the rules around approaching it, and you could have reminded them of the rules when they arrived. Ultimately, it was a collective responsibility to ensure that the children were safe around the animals.\n\nIn terms of the situation at hand, it may be more appropriate to focus on supporting your niece and her recovery rather than debating the fate of the donkey. It is important to recognize that accidents can happen, but it is our responsibility to take measures to prevent them from occurring. Therefore, it may be beneficial for all parties involved to reflect on what they could have done differently to ensure that the incident did not occur.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not productive to place blame on any one party in this situation. It is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of all involved, including the animals on the farm. Therefore, it may be more productive to focus on preventative measures and education around farm safety moving forward.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
