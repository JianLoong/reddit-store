I honestly cannot stand parents who don't teach their kids to respect animals , and then blame said animal because the animal reacted in a rather normal way . It sucked that happened to your niece , but her parents , one should have been with her , and two should have told her about the donkey so then she wouldn't have spooked him . I've seen several kids capable of being able to be quiet , and not be outburst like if someone tells them they need to be quiet and gentle .", "NAH. It is understandable that you feel attached to the donkey and do not want it to be put down. However, it is important to acknowledge that the safety and well-being of your niece is paramount. In this situation, it seems that everyone involved could have taken more responsibility to prevent the accident from occurring. Your brother and his wife should have warned their children about the donkey and the rules around approaching it, and you could have reminded them of the rules when they arrived. Ultimately, it was a collective responsibility to ensure that the children were safe around the animals.\n\nIn terms of the situation at hand, it may be more appropriate to focus on supporting your niece and her recovery rather than debating the fate of the donkey. It is important to recognize that accidents can happen, but it is our responsibility to take measures to prevent them from occurring. Therefore, it may be beneficial for all parties involved to reflect on what they could have done differently to ensure that the incident did not occur.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not productive to place blame on any one party in this situation. It is important to prioritize the safety and well-being of all involved, including the animals on the farm. Therefore, it may be more productive to focus on preventative measures and education around farm safety moving forward.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
