My mom is the most beautiful soul ever. Always there for us. Encouraged us in whatever dream or goal we had. \nTwo years ago my mom suffered a major stroke. She fought hard to learn to be able to walk and talk again. And we were with her every step of the way. Things were going great until this past year. My mom now has unknown neurological disorders that renders her paralyzed to at times almost a vegetative state. In between those times she\u2019s fine but can\u2019t be left alone. My dad is a truck driver but comes home every weekend and we have a nurse who helps during the day while we\u2019re at school or work. \nI was offered a full ride at one of our country\u2019s top universities when I graduated. My family, friends, and my girlfriend was so excited about it. But none as much as my mom. I was excited too. But I just couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t leave my mom\u2019s care on just my dad and brothers. \nMy gf thinks I\u2019m sick because I have zero problem feeding my mom, changing her diaper, bathing her, dressing her, carrying her outside to sit in her chair. (Neither does my dad or brothers). My gf recently told my mom that she was destroying my life and it would be best if she went to a home where others could deal with her. \nMy mom sat us all down crying and apologized to us for being a burden. Told us she was going to look at homes so we could be free to live our lives. When we finally found out why she was saying this, dad lost it. I called my gf and told her to stay the f*ck away from me and my family. That she was a cold hearted bitch who belongs in hell. \nShe called me a sick pervert. Now I have people talking about how I\u2019m in a sexual relationship with my mom. I\u2019m still pissed because my mom is hurting and depressed. None of us want her in a home. But if it\u2019s really what mom wants are we being selfish if we don\u2019t put her in one?", "created_utc": 1667926602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yprz51/aita_for_not_putting_my_mom_in_a_nursing_home/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your girlfriend (ex now, right?) was an asshole for even dreaming of inserting herself into this conversation and speaking to your mother that way. This is a family decision and not one your mother should take your ex\u2019s opinion into account when she makes it.", "NTA\n\nYour GF is a complete A H.\n\nYou need to take the dream university. I can promise you that more than anything in the world. Your mom wants you to have your future. That has been her dream for the past 19 years. Seeing you succeed will give her more peace and happiness than you could imagine.", "NTA your (hopefully ex) girlfriend was so far out of line that the line was a dot to her, to quote my dear friend Joey Tribbiani.\n\nThat said, your mom's *condition is* a burden. She can't help it, nobody can. She isn't a burden. But her condition is.\n\nShe's in no state to be taken care of by a family that needs their own lives. There are facilities and professionals for that, and I think all of you should sit down and talk this through as a family.", "NTA, but from someone who lived with their relative as helped be a caregiver during the end of their life, I think your mom would want you to go to college. She would not want you to give up everything she wished for you. She probably already feels horrible that you gave up your full-ride scholarship for her and this conversation was just icing on the cake. Did she specifically ask you guys to stay home with her and constantly care for her or does she think that this is what you want so she is going along with it?\n\nEdit: spelling", "Not allowing your Mom to make her own decision on this would be the ONLY asshole thing you have done or could do. She's been through hell, do not deny her the agency and respect to make this decision forherself. You do not have to agree with her choice or her reasons in order to support the decision of an adult you love.", "NTA. Your gf totally is and I really hope she's an ex now.\n\nBut.\n\nYou need to take the full ride to your dream school. It sucks about your mother, it breaks my heart. You, however, are still young and have your entire life ahead of you. You can't spend the rest of your life caring for her, you'll only end up resenting her for taking away your opportunities.", "Your ex g/f is wretched.  You are well rid of her.  I'm coming at this as a mother, and if she want's you to go to school, YOU GO TO SCHOOL.  Don't let her feel pain and guilt over her health that she doesn't have control over.  Your future is too big of a sacrifice.  Through her eyes that is.  Can more caregivers' be hired to help in the meantime?  You all need some time to let the emotion settle so you can logically think about the advantages of a care home and the disadvantages as well.  This does have to be considered carefully by everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYWBTA for doing research and caring and LISTENING to everything your mother says.", "NTA. You are taking care of your mom. There is nothing sexual about it. Cut anyone and everyone out of your life who says such things!\n\nYou decide how you want your future to be. If a top university gave you a full ride, then a local one will likely do the same. \n\nI think you need to get your mom some therapy. This was a horrible thing for your (Hopefully now ex) gf to do. Mom just needs some help to see she is not a burden to you.", "NTA but wow your gf is a massive one", "NTA but listen. I am 41 and the primary caregiver for my disabled mother. Every aspect of my life revolves around her. Luckily my father is \u201cok\u201d and can pitch in for short periods of time (had a family emergency and left for five days). But I have no life. I can\u2019t bring men home because it feels awkward. You are so young and I would never wish this on another person. But definitely ditch the GF.", "Holy shit, NTA. I cannot believe your ex gf said that! First of all, clarify to anyone even hinting that you have a sexual relationship with your mom that you ex is spreading that rumor because you act as a caregiver and she didn't like it. That's f-ing sick that she is telling people that. Second, I didn't have a mom growing up so I wouldn't lift a finger for her. But it sounds like you have a wonderful mother that you cherish and who gave you everything you needed in life to become a decent, kind, loving human being. Your ex had no right to say that to your mom. You're just trying to give back to her the same love she gave you. Your ex sounds like a narcissist. And it sounds like the only reason your mom wants to go to a home now is because your ex made her feel like a burden. If this is really something she won't drop, don't take away her last bits of autonomy and go with her wishes. But make sure you discuss with her first that your ex's views are not your family's views, and that she should not make this decision based on what that AH said. If she does stick to the decision visit her every day you're able to. Don't let her feel alone. It may end up making her feel less depressed and less of a burden (I doubt that now that ex planted that seed in her mind that she'll be able to fully shake it if she stays at home), but she can still see how much you care for her and love her. The time you spend together can be just about enjoying eachothers company instead of caring for her, and if done right it could be positive for everyone. But you're not wrong for wanting to provide that care for her! You love her and want her to feel like she's still important to the family despite her medical issues. Basically, as a family you need to talk to her, explain how you all feel, and let her decide from there. I'm so sorry. This really ia a terrible situation. You only get one mom, and you were blessed with a good one. You have a good heart, and nothing your ex says or does can take that away from you.", "NTA. Holy hell, OP. The only way that you could've been TA is if you stayed together with your disgusting ex. You're a good son and your mom is lucky to have you through this terrible time.", "NTA. That's a family decision. GF isn't family and she had no right sticking her nose in. Certainly hope she's now an ex.", "NTA. \nThis is a really difficult situation, for you, your dad, your brothers, and your mom. Lots of conversations need to happen here, and even if your girlfriend thinks that she is looking out for you, she is probably overstepping. Whoever is saying inappropriate things about your relationship with your mother, is disgusting. Changing your parents diapers, if you are willing, is part of caring for a family member. Obviously, this is a really difficult situation, but it doesn\u2019t make you T A.", "NTA. This is a horrible situation that you are all in. And it seems like yall are working things out fine. I do think youd be regretful for not taking your full ride. Yall should all sit down with your mom again and see what SHE really wants, not what she thinks yall want. And believe her on whatever she says.", "NTA the only disgusting person in this situation is the person formerly known as your gf", "NAH (other than your ex girlfriend, who is a disgusting piece of trash).  \n\n\nUnfortunately, this horrible situation you find yourself in doesn't have any happy endings.  If you go off to university and your mother goes into a home, you will have to deal with quite a lot of personal guilt.  That's a heavy weight to bear.  Unfortunately, if you give up your future and stay home, your mother will have to bear the weight of guilt for forcing you (in her mind), to give up your future on her behalf.    \n\n\nWhich of you is better able to bear up under intense feelings of guilt?  What is your mother's prognosis?  Will you feel the same way after caring for her for 2 years?  5 years?  10 years?  Will your brothers want to live up to the same standard of care you would be setting?  How would your mother do in a home?   None of these are easy questions, but they definitely deserve some (as best as you all can), objective thought - right now, you and your mother both seem eager to martyr yourselves, but that might not be the best course of action for either of you.  \n\n\nIs there any chance, by the way, that the university would allow you to defer for a year while still offering you a full ride?  That could definitely buy you some time for these discussions.", "NTA - 1st. Kick what should be the now ex-gf to the curb. 2nd. You cannot put your entire life on hold, no matter how hard it is. Do what is best for your mother at the end of the day, if a medical facility can help her retain what independence she has left, then do it. You're not giving up on her, you're trying to improve her quality of life.", "NTA.  Please no matter what you do, do go to college. I hope it\u2019s not too late, like if you would have supposed to have started already. That is an amazing opportunity and your mom would want you to go.   It will be for your entire future, your mom will be waiting for you on your breaks and when you\u2019re done.   You sound like an amazing person, and a good son and brother. I\u2019m sorry you had a terrible girlfriend.", "You're NTA for wanting to take care of your mom. Talk with your parents and see what they would genuinely prefer- it's possibly your dad would prefer to shoulder more of the burden of your mom's care while you go to school. Can they afford a home health aid part time to help during the semester?", "NTA. I just want to say you are a great son. I know you love your Mom and that is a beautiful thing. It doesn\u2019t matter what a bunch of idiots think about you. I think your Mom might feel guilty about her health situation and your girlfriend just confirmed her worst fears of being a burden. I\u2019m a Mom and we are used to being the rocks of our family and making sure we are the ones taking care of everyone and not the other way around. If your family wants her home, make sure all of you let her know that. Mom guilt is real and when we can\u2019t be there for the ones we love it\u2019s hard. Your ex girlfriend confirmed her worst fear but, reassure her that it isn\u2019t true. That if one day she wanted to be in a care facility then it\u2019s her choice but, if she wants to be home with the family that wants her home then to focus on what the family thinks and not some evil ex.\n\nAlso, some schools may allow you to defer for a year. That might allow the family enough time to transition the care to your family members if you so choose. You may decide to not go after all but, this might at least allow you an extra year to come up with a family plan.", "NTA\n\nMy mom is in a nursing home now. She has dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s. She recently fell and broke her leg. She can\u2019t dress or undress herself but she was able to take off the cast on her leg. She\u2019s in a wheelchair with an alarm. If she stands up, the alarm goes off. I visited yesterday and she set it off three times. She doesn\u2019t remember that she broke her leg. The nursing home is close by so I can visit as often as I want or can. Her roommate told me she has been hitting the nursing assistants. I have not seen that but I didn\u2019t see her come close once so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s true. Every expert told me not to be her caregiver. But that\u2019s because of the Alzheimer\u2019s not her physical problems. She didn\u2019t actually have much physically wrong with her, but Alzheimer\u2019s makes people do weird things. When my stepfather was still alive and with her they heard fireworks on New Years Eve. But they assumed they were gun shots. My stepfather got up to investigate and he fell on his face. There was a tiny spot my mom said was his blood. Maybe it was but they were believing what ever was the most scary. \n\nI called them out for it and had a long talk with them that the right wing media they were consuming was making them scared of everything. I had a long talk with a former personality host from Fox News. He explained everything they did to stoke their fears and get the riled up. Since I had all the proof, they finally believed me. But my stepfather still died shortly after that. He was already going to die, that just made it faster and made both of them crazy", "NTA - I\u2019m so livid at your ex. She sounds disgusting, making those assumptions just because she\u2019s either jealous of your relationship with your mom or doesn\u2019t understand what it means to truly love your parent. If you have a great parent with mutual unconditional love, doing something like this is no problem.\n\nI saw it when my mom was the primary caregiver for my grandma for the last near 2 decades of her life. My grandma was still independent and able-bodied up into her 90s, but in the last year or so before she passed she deteriorated quickly. She couldn\u2019t sleep, constantly yelling out, changing diapers. And it was so hard on my mom. But she did it all and said how she counted it all as a blessing. We helped out but she was the main carer, we did suggest when it got really bad that if it was too hard on her, if she thought it might be best to have her cared for somewhere else. But she preferred to care for her herself, so we supported her in that.\n\nThat\u2019s what you do. You support your loved ones. If your gf is insulting your wonderful mother and making up disgusting rumors about you, you\u2019re so much better off without her. Cherish every moment with your mom. Wishing you and your family the best, you all sound like beautiful souls.", "YTA.  Take this opportunity to go to school.\n\nYou aren't thinking rationally.  You have a chance to go to a great school for free.  You aren't your mom's parent or care taker.  Your mom and dad need to figure out her well being.  There are plenty of homes that can give her the proper care she needs.\n\n\"That she was a cold hearted bitch who belongs in hell. \"\n\nKiss that relationship good bye.
