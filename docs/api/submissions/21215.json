It\u2019s not a mark of alcoholism, I understand alcoholism because there\u2019s a reason a no longer drink.

If they wanted to they totally could have", "Prolly bc they wanted free drinks off OP.", "And don't people realize that it's rude to show up for a party without bringing a food or beverage? Unless told otherwise.   \nI'm not someone who needs booze, so I never assume there will be liquor at a party unless I know the host well enough to know that's a must at their parties.  And even, then I might stick with soda, especially if I'm driving (and sometimes I'll bring a 2-titer of a soft drink as my \"hostess\" gift).\n\nSo I would say you're NTA. It sounds like you have ungrateful friends.", "That's not even the real issue here (I mean to me, as an alcohol drinker). Who shows up to party (knowing there are 12/15 people going) expecting the host to provide all the alcohol?! Like wtf. Showing up to a party without your own alcohol is rude as fuck.", "I was 50/50 on if I'd be annoyed for at least not getting a heads up text until OP said they had Mario Kart. I don't need beers to huck a red shell on the turns on Rainbow Road with my homies. OP, you're all clear", "Not just alcohol but substances. Needing to be fucked up to have fun is just ridiculous to me", "If you **need** alcohol to celebrate, you actually need a therapist, full stop.", "10000% i agree!!!! i\u2019ve had several and gone to several non alcoholic parties, enjoyed the company and still had fun. if you NEED alcohol to have fun, that\u2019s a personal problem. if you\u2019re going to a friends bday, you should go for them and show you care vs caring more about alcohol", "Or you can do what you enjoy and let others do what they enjoy. This culture of needing to police other people's freedoms needs to end.", "Socially inept people patting themselves on the back for being socially inept lol", "The friends knew she didn't drink, why would she spend all that money to cater to others? Have they ever heard of BYOB???", "Apparently OP didn\u2019t even care if they brought alcohol. Everyone was just too rude apparently to BYOB.", "The only thing that makes me lean NTA is how they reacted, I would have been very slightly annoyed that I wasn\u2019t told byob but I wouldn\u2019t throw a hissy fit about it", "I know exactly what you're referring to, and there's a huge difference between forcing people to a dry wedding, and not providing alcohol to a get together.", "if their friends are old enough to drive/uber there on their own, they're old enough to swing by real quick to the liquor store or order delivery", "First, congrats on nearly 7 years sober. \n\nI understand it in those cases. But I don't think that applies here. They're not quite as busy, and none of them have kids yet. We do this pretty often (though usually we devide who brings drinks/snacks instead of one person getting it all). \n\nWe have gaming / movie afternoons quite often, and there's usually no alcohol at those. So I didn't think it would be expected. \n\nThe people I know from your age group usually bring a bottle of wine or something to social gatherings, which would have prevented this whole thing.", "It is irrilivant  if you drink or abstain when throwing a party .  Adult parties almost always include alcohol.  Common courtesy states  that on your invitations  that this event would be dry or BYOB. If not, it is assumed alcohol would be served. Time of day just changes the type of alcohol served..", "ASSumptions my boy, you know the saying.", "I don't know! I guess to some people 'party' means there will be alcohol.", "Not at all. But no one offered to bring anything. Except my best friend, who brought brownies.", "I also saw some of the comments, but I don't agree with all of them. In my opinion, you shouldn't even have to note BYOB or tell them there isn't going to be alcohol involved.", "Wait. So you provided the food and venue and didn\u2019t care if people who wanted to brought alcohol, and they\u2019re mad you didn\u2019t tell them you weren\u2019t providing it? If they had any actual manners you wouldn\u2019t have had to since they should have brought their own or asked what they could bring.", "Yeah this is ridiculous. I would never expect my non-drinking friend to supply me with alcohol. They could have BYOB\u2019d and didn\u2019t. That\u2019s on them. \n\nAnd yeah especially at noon, I would not have assumed there would be any alcohol at all unless the invite referenced drinks.", "You are NOT TH. They just wanted free booze and it's pathetic.", "OK so you answered my question here, NTA.  Next time solve it with BYOB.", "For medicinal purposes...", "That's what I'm thinking! Every party I've been to is byob and the host may provide liquor and leftover beers from the last party, but it's definitely not expected", "Exactly! I always bring my own bottle of wine when I go to a party or to dinner at someone\u2019s house.", "Right?  My friends and I do a \"book club\" gathering every couple of weeks, and several people always bring wine.  If you MUST have it, bring it.", "I mean, I provide the alcohol at my parties, most parties I've been to at least have a case or two of beer for company. Anybody is welcome to bring their own special drinks, but unless BYOB is specified most parties I go to provide alcohol of some sort.", "was about to say, this is what separates NTA from NAH. Alcohol is expensive yo, and its taken me a bit to build my collection, but if i'm expected to provide alcohol solely on my own whenever i throw an event, like i aint made of money", "Only if your 17 \ud83d\ude02 if I had a dinner party at my home I would provide alcohol as I have a bar lol", "If I throw a party and invite a bunch of people who like using weed or other substances, they won't be demanding that I provide those substances for them though. It's only with alcohol that people act this way. I've never had a stoner get mad at me when I don't have weed for them at my house.", "I totally agree with you. But we are in the minority here. I hate alcohol. I've had alcoholism in my family and I've seen what it does up close and personal. Nothing good comes from it. These people were just hoping for free booze. And it's pathetic.", "and if anyone wanted to drink, they brought their own and drank responsibly.", "But every party is assumed BYOB. That\u2019s just how it is.", "i must have missed the topic where people were being kidnaped and forced into dry weddings.  \n\n\nhowever i have seen times where alcoholics were so upset that they would miss a day of drinking that they demanded the wedding change it's rules,   if they need to be drunk that much they can just stay home, or go to a bar, instead of demanding wherever they go, allows them to get drunk", "NTA. Sounds like your friend may have a drinking problem.", "This guy just sounds like a major creep. Consider him not speaking to you a gift.", "What about for other birthday parties within the group? Is there usually a hang out where it is provided by them?", "This, I always brought my own and a bit to share.", "Appreciate it. \n\nI totally hear you, and certainly would not call you TA in this case. I think you already said it somewhere else, your friends heard \u201cparty\u201d and thought \u201ctime to get hammered\u201d, then disappointment when no booze. So yeah, in your case I do agree with you and everyone else saying NTA.", "Why does it matter if it was assumed there would be alcohol and there wasn\u2019t, why are these adults not able to handle their emotions when met with a very minor disappointment? Wasn\u2019t this about celebrating a FRIEND\u2019s birthday party? Seems more important than their expectation that they would get free booze.", "maybe it's a cultural thing, in Germany it's quite common to offer alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages in get-togethers.", "Then I would be surprised as you were about not knowing my friends as well as I thought.", "Just because you are the youngest dosen't mean you can't be the most matuer.", "I\u2019m more hung up on going to a party/bbq and not bringing anything. Like isn\u2019t common courtesy to ask if you can bring anything whether it\u2019s food, dessert, beverages? If OP said she had it covered then you at least bring beverages. You don\u2019t just show up empty handed.", "Yea I don\u2019t get this. Also, even if it was a drinking party, apparently no one was thoughtful enough to bring their own? \n\nIn my experience at parties/get togethers with friends, the host usually gets a bunch of alcohol to offer as a gesture but the guests also bring alcohol to be polite, and the host usually ends up with more alcohol than they started with.", "My weddings too.", "Especially informal ones! Sometimes I throw cocktail parties with a cocktail menu I put a lot of thought into - in those cases, I've carefully planned my booze needs and it's not necessary. But the average party? Rude", "Maybe you just haven\u2019t been invited to the correct parties.", "I always provide alcohol when having people round as well (to drink/eat etc) but I **have never** shown up to someone else's home without alcohol and expected to be supplied it for the night.\n\nAnd I 100% wouldn't expect a non drinking friend to provide me any alcohol (if they did sweet but wouldn't expect it, just like I wouldn't expect to be served any meat dishes at a get together held by any of my vegetarian friends).\n\nIt's the same for every get together involving my friends and family. Everyone (that drinks) brings booze, including the host (all of which ends up being shared between everyone) and most people also bring something to eat (if not then extra booze to share).", "Our friends know that they are always welcome to any drinks in our house (and we are typically well stocked) and still bring some along. The culture in my area is like an alcohol potluck\u2014everyone brings something and puts it in the coolers/fridge to share!", "This wasn't a dinner party it was a chill get together. You and I drink, so yeah ofc we're probs gonna provide it, OP doesn't drink. \n\nMy comment was not talking about providing alcohol at my home, it was talking about turning up to someone else's empty handed, which I would never do because I consider it rude (actually the younger someone is *the more* acceptable I find it for them to turn up empty handed). If it's a dinner party then a bottle of champagne or wine at the least, if a get together/party then I'm bringing spirits and mixer.", "I'm sorry, but no. I absolutely enjoy alcohol, but even if i expect alcohol at a more casual event, im not holding it against anyone if there is none. \n\nIf you want alcohol at an event, and none is provided, you go without or ask the host if its okay to bring some and do a quick liquor run, simple as that. The host is gracious enough to provide the venue plus whatever else if offered, why would i ding them that no alcohol is offered?", "It's not that it's not common to have alcohol per se. But the social etiquette is going to lead by the host.  If the host doesn't drink,  you wouldn't expect alcohol.  If the host doesn't smoke weed,  you wouldn't expect that to be provided. If the host can't have gluten, you wouldn't expect baked goods.  If the host is vegan,  you wouldn't expect meat.  Etc.  \n\nThe big problem is the expectation of the guests when nothing about OP suggests that it is an activity that she's participates in.", "This is why I used to pre game but I also always brought something with. I quit drinking years ago and have the expectation that anyone expecting to drink at my house will bring their own. These \"friends\" are awful.", "I might... my drug of choice is coffee rather than alcohol but people give me funny looks when I arrive with a jar of coffee.\n\nI usually bring a bottle of wine for the host but I am a gentlemanly fellow (in my own mind, at least).", "Yeah who does this?", "Exactly. A really good friend will ask the host or hostess if there's something specific they can bring. Else, you bring a bottle of wine, a 2-liter of soda (I usually bring a name brand), a dessert.", "I do BYOB and take YOB. People would drink the pretty standard beers offered by the host, and then the host gets stuck with a weird mix of watermelon shandy and Christmas porter because people brought their own mix of leftover undesirable beverages they didn't want, either.", "It\u2019s normal not to open the bar until after the ceremony. You shouldn\u2019t hear ice clinking & people slurping while the vows are being exchanged.", "My friend got married recently and the wedding was nice and we all had fun, but he actually said to me \u201cI paid good money to have a cash bar, so go nuts.\u201d  Still not sure if he was saying that jokingly or if he was dead serious. Either would fit his character.", "Daytime brunch literally is known for \u201cbottomless mimosas\u201d it\u2019s VERY common to have afternoon drinks.", "Ah yes.

This isn't OP's problem.", "well, I never claimed it was a \"nice bottle\"...", "Lol exactly. Not to mention, there would be stirring or sloshing, someone might spill & cause a commotion, then the wedding party are the only ones without drunks & they might be thirsty just watching other people drink!
