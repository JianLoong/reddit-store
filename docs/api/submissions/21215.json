They all seemed excited. \n\nBut they seemed disappointed when they got there and there wasn't any alcohol. Some were even upset. And one of them texted me after to tell me how rude it was to not let them know beforehand. He hasn't spoken to me since. \n\nNow, I don't drink. Its not something I considered to \"need\" for a get-together. I didn't even think of it. But several of my friends were upset, with one of them being downright angry. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdited to add: I guess to my friends 'party = alcohol', so they were expecting it.

It\u2019s not a mark of alcoholism, I understand alcoholism because there\u2019s a reason a no longer drink.

NEEDING alcohol, none of them thought to bring their own.", "I'm grateful to see this comment with so many upvotes. I was downvoted to oblivion a few weeks ago when I remarked in a thread that after quitting alcohol 5 years ago, and adjusting my social circle to no longer include heavy drinkers, I legitimately don't think \"party\" = booze anymore. There are all kinds of parties that don't include alcohol- including kids parties (although some people apparently need to get drunk at those), tea parties (although apparently some people bring a flask to those as well), baby showers (although, once again, apparently 'at least mimosas' are expected by many). \n\nI honestly wish we as a society could move more away from the alcohol dependency, or at least alcohol-centric viewpoints. There are so many ways to enjoy celebrating things with others, without needing to be wasted to do so.", "Yeahhhh. Like, I drink almost every day and love being tipsy, but I would never assume someone who doesn't drink would provide alcohol at their birthday party. Like seriously. Most drunk people are annoying, why would any of them think that on her birthday, OP would want to be surrounded by drunk people? NTA OP. I would send a text to the group just clarifying no party you host will involve alcohol. Find out who your true friends are next time you throw one.", "OP did not mention where they are from. But in the U.S people will drink for any occasion. It's big part of the culture sadly. Like just going out for lunch people will get a drink.", "This. The fact that people can\u2019t go a couple hours without drinking is wild to me. Like what.", "People don\u2019t NEED alcohol to celebrate. Just like they don\u2019t NEED popcorn to enjoy a movie. But most people would be disappointed to show up to the theater and find out there\u2019s none available", "OP being a non-drinker and the friends knowing this seals the deal. Anyone who\u2019s ever had a sober friend should always assume gatherings are BYOB unless stated otherwise", "Not to mention intending to get smashed when the person being celebrated can't drink is just flat-out rude. If the host is going to be sober and with it, stay sober with them. You can still have plenty of fun without kicking your liver and kidneys. I've been in that situation due to my own issues with alcohol and anxiety. It felt really lonely for everyone else to be totally gone from booze while I sat there almost being ignored because they all found it hilarious to fail at simple sentences.", "Were they driving their children home from the party after drinking? :(", "Not all alcoholics act like asses over lack of drink, but whenever someone does act like that they're either alcoholics or in denial imo.  *Not being able to go without* is like, the biggest addiction red flag lol, especially when it makes you overtly irritable.", "Yeah \ud83d\ude14 No one driving a long distance (small city. Less than 10 minutes to get from one side of town to the other), but still.", "Danke!", "Exactly, you wanna drink, you do it safely and responsibly, it's not for me but enjoy it. You need me to provide you with alcohol for the night or you're going to cut me out of your life? That's literally one of the tests for addiction, if the substance is getting in the way of your friendships"]}
