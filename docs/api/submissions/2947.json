He's the only father figure she had.\n\n\nHowever, I found out that she's reconnected with her bio dad through his family (his mother) which I wasn't happy about but I didn't make a fuss about it. Then she started mentioning him often, going to visit him while canceling plans to hang out with us etc. Her justification is that her dad is sick and might be (I say might because she's a child and may not know what it meant) terminal. She sees him at his friend's house where he's staying now.\n\n\nChristopher and I were planning her 17th birthday party at our house. Kelly told me that she'd like to have her bio dad come over to celebrate since he may not be able to be around next year. Christopher said no immediately. He said he won't let that man come into his house which made Kelly cry saying that we were robbing her of a last chance to make memories with her dad after finally finding him again. I told her that I don't feel comfortable having him come to the house and be in the same room as him. Her stepsister said that both me and christopher are overreacting and that Kelly wants her dad to take part in her birthday so badly. Christopher left the house and I snapped at Kelly and threatened to cancel the whole thing.\n\n\nLater whrn we calmed down I suggested she goes to celebrate with him but she said her friends and their parents won't be able to attend. She also said he can't throw her the party since he's sick. We had another argument and she started ignoring me and christopher while staying in her room. She's saying she won't forgive me if I let her dad miss what coukd be her last birthday with him.\n\n\n\nAm I being unreasonable or is she?", "created_utc": 1669117969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1rngc/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_daughter_invite_her/", "score": 11992, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She sees him at his friend's house where he's staying now.\n\n\nChristopher and I were planning her 17th birthday party at our house. Kelly told me that she'd like to have her bio dad come over to celebrate since he may not be able to be around next year. Christopher said no immediately. He said he won't let that man come into his house which made Kelly cry saying that we were robbing her of a last chance to make memories with her dad after finally finding him again. I told her that I don't feel comfortable having him come to the house and be in the same room as him. Her stepsister said that both me and christopher are overreacting and that Kelly wants her dad to take part in her birthday so badly. Christopher left the house and I snapped at Kelly and threatened to cancel the whole thing.\n\n\nLater whrn we calmed down I suggested she goes to celebrate with him but she said her friends and their parents won't be able to attend. She also said he can't throw her the party since he's sick. We had another argument and she started ignoring me and christopher while staying in her room.

I would either take her myself or get her to her dad's house and they would go together. \n\nIf she was with me and just randomly decided she missed her dad (or vice-versa), we would call the other, and if possible, we would make the switch. Sometimes she had something she wanted to talk about & only wanted her mom. My ex would bring her over and i would keep her that night. Point is, my daughter's needs and her comfort and stability always came first to both of us. \n\nI can't tell you how many parties I sat through where I wanted to be ANYWHERE else, but did it for my daughter. Her dad did the same.  We both mad compromises and sacrifices when we didn't want to be our daughter mattered more.\n\nMy daughter's dad passed away when she was 14.

This lets the daughter have the last chance with her dad, if this is what it is.  It lets stepdad evaluate the situation, see if it is safe and appropriate.  It lets the family celebrate together.  And it lets OP avoid direct contact with the ex.\n\nNow, if there is another complicating factor, such as past abuse, that's something that needs to be addressed.  First, the daughter must be told exactly why OP is so stressed by this idea.  Second, if there was abuse, then having the stepdad evaluate the situation is appropriate.  Third, if there was a history of bio-dad being abusive, then OP and stepdad should not have allowed the daughter to visit, at all, without one of them there to supervise.  Navigating interaction with an abuser is absolutely something a teenager can do on their own.  Just forbidding visits won't work if the daughter can use public transportation or drive on her own to get there.

If he was abusive during the relationship or there was stalking or threats of violence afterward, that would absolutely be acceptable grounds for not wanting him in your home or around you at all. In that situation I\u2019d say NTA. \n\nIf the relationship just didn\u2019t work out and you both went your separate ways, there\u2019s really no reason to take this opportunity away from your daughter. You may be angry that he wasn\u2019t the father she deserved, you may be angry that he abandoned you and left you to struggle to raise her alone. Your anger is justified however, this is one of those situations where we as parents, have an obligation to set our own feelings aside, grin and bear it for the sake of our children. \n\nThis is her day, she is not being unreasonable for wanting to have her biological father in attendance. It may be uncomfortable and awkward for you but, so what. Being polite and courteous to someone you can\u2019t stand may be hard to do through gritted teeth but, it\u2019s free. \n\nI assure you at 17, your daughter knows what it means to have a terminal illness. I guarantee you that if you were to deny her this opportunity, to have her father spend her birthday with her and he is dead before her next one, she will never forgive you. It will cause a rift in her relationship with you and her relationship with your husband. Even if she eventually stops being angry, she will always carry a deep seated trauma that will fester and manifest itself in other areas of your relationship. That\u2019s a cost that\u2019s too high. You don\u2019t want that. Understand that your daughter, while young is not a really a child. She\u2019s nearly a young adult and certainly old enough to decide for herself who in her family she wants to have a relationship with. Don\u2019t force her to choose between her parents. It puts her in a very difficult situation, choosing between three parental figures that she loves. The only ones with something to lose are you and your husband. \n\nIf he\u2019s indeed terminally ill, the time she has to spend with him is running out. She no doubt has feelings of abandonment. Even though as you say, her stepfather has been there for her as a father figure, there\u2019s always going to be a trauma associated with her bio dad\u2019s absence in her life. Her desire to heal that wound is understandable. She needs the opportunity to do that now, before he\u2019s gone. She\u2019s probably spent every birthday as long as she can remember, wishing that her dad was there. Wondering why she wasn\u2019t important enough for him to make an effort to be in her life. Even if she\u2019s never shared those feelings with you, she\u2019s had them. Now she has this one chance for that wish to be fulfilled. She\u2019s giving him the chance to show up for her, to prove to her that he does in fact care about her. He may not deserve that chance, but it\u2019s not about what he deserves or doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s about what she needs so that she can heal her wounds. \n\nParents have to choose their battles wisely. One misstep can cause far reaching and long lasting consequences. Is this really the hill that you want to die on? Take your own emotions and feelings out of the equation. In this situation, you have an obligation to decide based on what\u2019s in her best interest. You have to protect her from further trauma. If you deny her this chance, you\u2019ll be the one who\u2019s inflicting the trauma on her. Just give this too her. It\u2019s a few hours of misery for you that will avoid a lifetime of pain for her.", "Of course, YTA. Why bother throwing your daughter a birthday party if it's really only for you and your husband?

I personally feel that parents should never put hands on their children in anger or even for punishment,  but I also recognize that it's done by many people, so I don't know that I can call it outright physical abuse.) \n\nMy husband has seen the way we all struggled in various ways in the aftermath of this treatment and I know would NOT welcome my ex into our home with any relish. \n\nI don't honestly know what I would do in OP's situation, but I am leaning towards that my ex would not be invited to my home, but my child (in their late teens) would not be prevented from establishing a relationship with him outside of my home, which is where OP came down as well.", "If that was the case, I'm sure she would've put it it the post.", "If he was abusive, wouldn't you think 1) that OP would have said so and 2) most importantly, she'd have taken steps to protect her daughter, who has been spending time with this man alone?

My mom was abused by her first husband but my Dad raised my two older half-siblings as his own, and you can see the disappointment cross his face whenever they bring up the first husband *around my mother*.

It's because he can't stand that someone would actually beat the shit out of his wife on a weekly basis.", "Seems most likely that if that were the case OP would have absolutely shared that.", "I am wondering if maybe he was in prison.", "This.

Fortunately, her father didn\u2019t maliciously hurt her like he did my grandma but he put her in very serious danger and left her with trauma.\n\nI assume 99% of these AITA posts are made up but treating this as if it\u2019s real, abuse does wonky things to thought processes. The court system even perpetuates that as people who abuse their spouses are often given at least partial custody of their children as long as there is no evidence they abused that particular child (sometimes even if they abused a sibling). People who were raised in abusive households can have an easier time ending up in an abusive relationship and may simply not realize that allowing a child to be in that situation isn\u2019t good. Many people feel guilty, and will often be guilted, if they don\u2019t facilitate a relationship between child and abusive parent. Sometimes the severe self esteem damage resulting from abuse can lead people to think that there is something so wrong with them personally that they are the only one who would be abused. Sometimes people stay in abusive relationships because they are convinced the other person is a bad spouse but great parent, only to find out later they abused the children too. \n\nIt\u2019s messy but it\u2019s completely within the realm of how people respond in real life that a parent might allow their child to go spend time with a parent who was abusive and not think the child is at any particular risk. \n\nIf this is actually real and there was any abuse at all, I would strongly, strongly encourage OP to get family counseling going ASAP and figure out safe boundaries for herself and daughter. \n\nIf not, she still doesn\u2019t have to be around this man but could facilitate a party at a rental location and parents could each be there half the time.", "Based on the way OP wrote this, I'd take everything she says with a grain of salt.

OP can ignore her ex, but not that her ex is Kelly's father. Her feelings towards her dying ex could destroy her relationship with \"Kelly\". It will certainly make things worse for \"Kelly\" when her dad dies, if OP denies her daughter this memory. Her daughter will need the love, comfort & support of her mother.

Is it really so hard to suck it up for a few hours, so that you can support your daughter & avoid losing her forever? Is the hatred towards the ex really worth the pain & trauma it will cause their daughter when he dies? If OP refuses, because they don't think a 16 year old is capable of understanding what terminal means & he is terminal, he won't be around for any other birthdays or milestones in their daughter's life this is it.\n\n\nOne birthday party & then OP & her husband get what they always wanted & never have to see him again. They can go on with their lives pretending he doesn't exist, because he won't exist anymore. Which is exactly why \"Kelly\" is saying she'll never forgive them. SHE wants this one last happy memory with her dad. She knows he won't be alive to see her 18th, 21st, or any other birthday. She knows he won't be alive when she graduates. She knows he won't be alive when she gets her first home. He won't be alive when she gets engaged. He won't be alive when she gets married. He won't be alive when she becomes a mother.

It's the last chance & the only person OP is truly hurting is her daughter that she claims to love. Her ex won't have long to live with the regret, OP & her husband won't make him suffer for long with this punishment. Is their revenge really worth the collateral damage, trauma to their daughter? Is it worth losing her? Making her wonder why they hate her so much that they took this last chance to celebrate her birthday with her bio dad ? She's going to spend a long time in therapy learning to live with the guilt caused by OP saying no.\n\n\nOP just has to decide does she love her daughter more than she hates her ex? Does hurting & denying her ex matter to OP & her husband more than hurting & denying their daughter this last chance? What is certain is that OP, their husband & \"Kelly\" will have to live with the consequences for a lot long than the ex, because he hasn't got long to live at all.

So she can say \u201cI told you so\u201d?", "Then his parents should plan it", "Of course his feelings are hurt. This reads like he is being rejected by the daughter he helped raise. Who wouldn't be hurt.", "We had a similar situation as well. It resulted in a lot of extra testing during my pregnancies due to a possible \u201cgenetic heart condition\u201d of which we were never given any details. Supposedly he was sick and terminal but this was already 9 years ago and he seems to be doing just fine (despite our lack of contact).", "I had an ex do that too after we split! He had a lump on his testicle and before he even had it looked at, he said it was \"probably cancer,\" and from there, \"terminal cancer.\" He convinced his mom to help finance a new/used Jeep for him and tried to convince ME to keep him on my car insurance (we had just split a couple months prior) under the guise that he thought he was going to die and that he just wanted to have a nice car for a while before he went, but his payment record was abysmal, so he couldn't get affordable car insurance on his own.  \n\n\nOnce he got it checked out at the doctor, of course, no mention was ever made of it again because there was no cancer of any kind.  xD I think he just wanted sympathy and my attention after we broke up, and of course to continue taking advantage of me financially as he did while we were together. Needless to say, he had lied about similar things in the past and I did NOT play into his requests, which then led to him trying to guilt me into not helping him because he was \"dying.\" -eyeroll-  \n\n\nSome people are interesting like that...", "My late mil was definitely a hypochondriac; without fail, a couple of days before a holiday, if we were planning dinner at their home, with us and my husband's older brother's, their wives, and all the grandchildren, she would call me(we lived very close, unlike the others)and tell me to make dinner, she was getting sick; not sick yet, but \"getting a good one\", for years! Lol!\nBefore I married into the family, evidently my fil was at the end of his rope, with all of the years of hypochondria, and his friend, \nwho was a surgeon, performed a fake surgery just to appease her that yes, something was wrong! This was back in the late 1960s, and it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to do now. It supposedly satisfied her for a while.", "That's not true.

We don't know which it is here, but given the fact that this man abandoned his family, I'm guessing it's closer to the latter. Also, does OP's daughter NEED him to come to her mother's house? That sounds like a want. OP is not preventing her from seeing him. I think it's OP's right to set a boundary about her ex being in her house.", "Exactly.  First step no matter what is to establish the truth of his health.", "These are not Court mandated visits lol  so your whole speech is irrelevant", "Or chris is a jealous little man and the mom is just trying to save face by snapping at her daughter about it", "16 can legally get married and have kids in some states.

Sounds like ops trying to let her get in time with him while she can.", "I don\u2019t think op is trying to end the relationship with the ex and daughter she and her husband don\u2019t want him in their house. Which I can understand.  \n\nThe ex could have small celebration with his family. He should not be expect to be invited to op\u2019s house. And daughter is 17 and not 8 she is old enough to have a understanding what her dad put her kin through.", "Can attest to this. My dad got diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer when I was 7. We all knew what was coming. Can't say I truly understood what was going on at the time, but I knew he was going to die. OP's daughter is in high school, not preschool. Besides, in this day and age she could literally look the word up.", "I had the opposite growing up. My dad and I had a fractured relationship while my stepdad was always there for me, and even so they BOTH walked me down the aisle when I got married. It\u2019s how it should be done. Neither of my dads took issue with each other. Christopher is a child.", "She said that she wouldn't be able to have her friends and their parents if she had a separate celebration with him.   Why not if one of her paternal relatives throws a party?    Have a multi-event party - lunch with Mom and and dinner with Dad.\n\nI can sympathize a little with Kelly - it's a hard thing to be rejected by a parent.  Someone I know invited their long-gone father to their wedding in desperation.   He didn't come.", "She's well within her rights to not have that man in her house. And it's well within the stepdads rights not to have that man in the house.

Or police/federal government. Or witness protection. \n\nSailors deploy on ships for months at a time. could've been deployed overseas. Under cover of a cop or fed. \n\nI could see why those situations NC might be considered the best in a break up. \n\nMilitary would explain terminal illness now if dude was stationed by the burn pits. Then OP would be a major AH.", "Dad is an AH, so reward him by welcoming him back in? Mom did the right thing all these years, so she should willingly suffer to make her daughter happy or else she's the AH, too? That's messed up. You can't tell me that that isn't.\n\nThe daughter isn't wrong for wanting to be with her dad, but she is wrong for forcing them all together. It's a fight waiting to break out at worst, and a damn awkward party at best. How would any of them be happy with the end result?", "The solution was that the daughter could spend the day with her father if she wanted, but not at OPs house or with OP present. What's so bad about that? How is a big party, with tons of people stealing her attention away from her bio dad better than spending a quiet evening with him doing something with just the two or them or his family? If he's weak, or immunocompromised, then he really shouldn't be in a house full of strangers, anyway. She wants as much time as possible with him, after all.", "OP is not keeping her daughter from bio dad. She simply wants bio dad to celebrate with her daughter separate. And bio dad has the option to throw the party and chooses not to.", "Yeah none of that is true tho. Your projection about your mom issues isn\u2019t what\u2019s happening here.", "This is addressed by the daughter in the post, she wants one party because her friends won't be able to attend two parties.", "\u201cI say might because she\u2019s a *child* and might not know what it meant.\u201d\n\nIt seems fairly clear she feels her daughter doesn\u2019t understand the word terminal.

But either way, I think she's TA for yelling at her daughter for wanting biodad around and threatening to cancel. If OP has a really good reason for not being comfortable with biodad, she can tell her daughter that.", "I think that's the conflict to OP's mind. On one hand she can shield her daughter from the scenario that from her gut feeling is going to happen and risk lifelong resentment, on the other hand she can let her daughter own her life choices and be there when she is let down. It's painful whatever she chooses.", "Yeah it\u2019s hard but it changes the situation. If he abused THEN left OP, then she has safety and trauma reasons to refuse to be in a room and she should tell Kelly so that Kelly can keep herself safe and understand what went on. If he only left OP and didn\u2019t abuse her, then it\u2019s not a safety concern but an emotional one and she has to weigh being around someone who majorly let her down against denying her daughter a specific request she\u2019s made for one special day. I disagree with the other commenter who said it\u2019s dumb but I think it\u2019s extremely relevant in judging the situation.", "If the daughter has forgiven him and wants him around, shouldn\u2019t that count for something?", "While you're correct, this isn't about giving a damn about the father. It's about giving a damn about her child's feelings.", "I think what a lot of people are missing and what OP and her husband are missing is that it's NOT OP's birthday, it's her kid's who clearly wants to create a bond with the father she never knew. None of the stuff you mentioned matters if the child is the one who wants to form a relationship with the estranged parent. It's not hard being cordial and putting the wishes of your kid first. Children being curious about their missing parents is normal and I think OP is being a little selfish. This isn't a dick measuring contest and OP shouldn't feel hurt that her kid wants to meet her dad. If anything, move the party to a more neutral location like a park or venue.", "He's not an AH in this situation.\nHe was an AH for all those years prior.\n\nNow he's trying to have a relationship with his daughter before he dies, and she is receptive.\nIt may be late in the game, but he isn't an AH for it.\n\nEveryone is so busy trying to ensure he is punished for his past behavior.  He should what, die without his daughter knowing him.  So, ok, that punishes him.  What about her?  She wants this, should she be robbed of it because he needs to suffer?\n\nThe mother doesn't have to forgive him.\nThe daughter has, or at least enough to want to spend time with him.\n\nThat is literally all that matters.", "You got Royal Tenenbaum for a dad? Glad you went NC.", "This is where communication comes into play, and the fact that OP is musing about whether or not her nearly adult daughter knows the definition of \u201cterminal\u201d rather than having a conversation about it makes me think that communication is lacking in this household.\n\nDaughter would know that the birthday party was a one time good-faith invitation because it\u2019s her birthday and what would make her happy as long as it\u2019s properly communicated.

Bio-dad out of nowhere wants to have a relationship after years of no contact. It probably makes the daughter feel special. She doesn't have the bad memories like the mother and step-dad have of this dead beat dad because she was so young, it's easy for her to romanticize the situation and be forgiving and let him back in. But for those of us who have been the daughter who let dead beat dad back in their life and then get extremely hurt by him again (because let's be honest some people change but some people NEVER change) we have a feeling from our own experience what could be going on.\n\nBut yeah this case is split pretty 50/50 and that's because some of us have been burned by dead-beat parents their whole lives and others have not had that experience so think OP is being the Ahole.\n\nOP is NTA.

Even if her step-father is the only one doing the day-to-day parenting, the daughter could very reasonably see her biological father as her dad. \n\nIt's also pretty unclear how old the daughter was when OP met Christopher. OP mentions she \"struggled\" until she met him, but not how long after her separation from her daughter's father it was. So OP could have been 5, or she could have been 15 and the difference in age can make a huge difference in how much of a \"dad\" a child sees their step-father as. Whether Christopher ever actually worked at being her dad matters too. I'm not saying step-dads can't be dads - I've seen a kid refer to her step (now adopted) father as \"dad\" and her biological father by his first name.

He lived to a ripe old age, and sadly when he did indeed have a terminal illness at the end nobody believed him because he had cried wolf too many times over too many decades to get attention.

So yeah, ideally she should have insisted on set visitation that was supervised.
