Her bio dad left when she was 4. It's complicated but despite him being away he still sent money or had his family help from time to time. I still struggled a lot raising her til I met my now husband \"Christopher\". Christopher is like a dad to Kelly. He's the only father figure she had.\n\n\nHowever, I found out that she's reconnected with her bio dad through his family (his mother) which I wasn't happy about but I didn't make a fuss about it. Then she started mentioning him often, going to visit him while canceling plans to hang out with us etc. Her justification is that her dad is sick and might be (I say might because she's a child and may not know what it meant) terminal. She sees him at his friend's house where he's staying now.\n\n\nChristopher and I were planning her 17th birthday party at our house. Kelly told me that she'd like to have her bio dad come over to celebrate since he may not be able to be around next year. Christopher said no immediately. He said he won't let that man come into his house which made Kelly cry saying that we were robbing her of a last chance to make memories with her dad after finally finding him again. I told her that I don't feel comfortable having him come to the house and be in the same room as him. Her stepsister said that both me and christopher are overreacting and that Kelly wants her dad to take part in her birthday so badly. Christopher left the house and I snapped at Kelly and threatened to cancel the whole thing.\n\n\nLater whrn we calmed down I suggested she goes to celebrate with him but she said her friends and their parents won't be able to attend. She also said he can't throw her the party since he's sick. We had another argument and she started ignoring me and christopher while staying in her room. She's saying she won't forgive me if I let her dad miss what coukd be her last birthday with him.\n\n\n\nAm I being unreasonable or is she?", "created_utc": 1669117969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1rngc/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_daughter_invite_her/", "score": 265, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then she started mentioning him often, going to visit him while canceling plans to hang out with us etc. Her justification is that her dad is sick and might be (I say might because she's a child and may not know what it meant) terminal. She sees him at his friend's house where he's staying now.\n\n\nChristopher and I were planning her 17th birthday party at our house. Kelly told me that she'd like to have her bio dad come over to celebrate since he may not be able to be around next year. Christopher said no immediately. He said he won't let that man come into his house which made Kelly cry saying that we were robbing her of a last chance to make memories with her dad after finally finding him again. I told her that I don't feel comfortable having him come to the house and be in the same room as him. Her stepsister said that both me and christopher are overreacting and that Kelly wants her dad to take part in her birthday so badly. Christopher left the house and I snapped at Kelly and threatened to cancel the whole thing.\n\n\nLater whrn we calmed down I suggested she goes to celebrate with him but she said her friends and their parents won't be able to attend. She also said he can't throw her the party since he's sick. We had another argument and she started ignoring me and christopher while staying in her room. She's saying she won't forgive me if I let her dad miss what coukd be her last birthday with him.\n\n\n\nAm I being unreasonable or is she?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But it\u2019s Dad\u2019s actions  that caused this, and not on mom to fix.", "her mother did not ask for the deathbeat to leave her too... her mother did not only do HER job she did the job of the deathbeat too..", "Of course not.  The girl snuck behind her mother's back to start speaking to this man, her attitude is deteriorating, and now she's threatening to 'never forgive' them?   50/50 odds the terminal illness thing is a lie.  His presence is toxic.  \n\nWhat kind of man wants to be inside his ex's new home with someone else?  Most guys would pay money to avoid something that awkward.", "Or maybe have a conversation with her daughter. Saying clearly and calmly this is my boundary (him not being in my house). Offer some alternatives (someone else's house, restaurant etc). Tell her that they are willing to accommodate her as long as that boundary is respected and it's within their budget, ask her if she has any suggestions. But 100% agree with everything you said it's not a clear cut situation we all have people that we don't like or want to be around, treating their daughter like an adult with a valid opinion would probably go along way", "And Op isn\u2019t denying her daughter that at all. They even said she can celebrate with him instead, but she doesn\u2019t want that, because she won\u2019t be able to have a party as well. So either she wants to be with dad, or she wants to have a party. She doesn\u2019t need a party to say goodbye to her father. Kelly is 17, aka old enough to understand boundaries and that people have a right to them.\n\nMy parents have we\u2019re divorced around the same age hers were. At 17, I understood that my parents didn\u2019t like being around each other and they only met in neutral places like my school events, church, etc. However, I knew my mom wouldn\u2019t be welcomed in in my dads house, and my dad was for damn sure not allowed to even step on my mother\u2019s porch. The only other compromise would be to have it somewhere else. But Kelly can\u2019t be demanding that people just let others into the house. 17 is old enough to know everything is going to go they way you want it", "Yeah no. My dad literally hit my mother in front of everyone at a church convention. I would never expect her to put her feelings aside to be around him, even though she did on multiple occasions, just NOT IN HER HOUSE.", "No she shouldn\u2019t. She gave Kelly a compromise, she didn\u2019t want it. She can celebrate with her dad, she\u2019s choosing not to because she won\u2019t be able to have a party. I\u2019m sorry, but if her dad being able to spend her birthday with her is that important, the party shouldn\u2019t really matter all that much. It should matter that you got to spend your birthday with your dad", "So. Op doesn\u2019t have to let the dying man into her house", "This!", ">OP doesn\u2019t mention that the dad treated her horribly, only that he left.\n\nThat's what INFO judgment is for if there are crucial details missing that could sway judgement. They both had strong reactions to not wanting him in their house. Even if nothing happened that's their right. It's also understandable that the girl would be upset about that. Mom is trying to come up with a compromise. How is a compromise not fair here?", "Op is also letting her kid see her dad, she isn\u2019t stopping them having a relationship at all. She doesn\u2019t want him in her house which is perfectly reasonable.", "The person that raises the child is the parent not the one that abandons them for years and plays the part when the kid is 17.", "> treating their daughter like an adult with a valid opinion would probably go along way\n\nGreat comment.", "Ironic you say 17 is old enough to understand everything doesn\u2019t go the way she wants but her mother is way older than that and should know the same.\n\nMom doesn\u2019t HAVE to do anything that\u2019s true but it\u2019s also true that mom doesn\u2019t have to be so immature she threatens to cancel a child\u2019s birthday over it not going the way she wants. Sounds like Kelly is the mature one here", "OP doesn't have to so I hope she's ok sacrificing the relationship with her daughter", "She\u2019s not being immature. She doesn\u2019t want someone in her safe space, and that\u2019s her right. She gave Kelly an option, Kelly didn\u2019t want it. A party shouldn\u2019t be that important if the goal is to spend time with your dad on your birthday.", "I highly disagree I think the mothers actions are extremely immature and are similar to throwing a tantrum \n\nKelly is a teenager parties are important and so is spending time w the people that mean something to them. I\u2019m confused on why you except a teenager whose brain is a decade away from full development to be more mature than her parents"]}
