She sees him at his friend's house where he's staying now.\n\n\nChristopher and I were planning her 17th birthday party at our house. Kelly told me that she'd like to have her bio dad come over to celebrate since he may not be able to be around next year. Christopher said no immediately. He said he won't let that man come into his house which made Kelly cry saying that we were robbing her of a last chance to make memories with her dad after finally finding him again. I told her that I don't feel comfortable having him come to the house and be in the same room as him. Her stepsister said that both me and christopher are overreacting and that Kelly wants her dad to take part in her birthday so badly. Christopher left the house and I snapped at Kelly and threatened to cancel the whole thing.\n\n\nLater whrn we calmed down I suggested she goes to celebrate with him but she said her friends and their parents won't be able to attend. She also said he can't throw her the party since he's sick. We had another argument and she started ignoring me and christopher while staying in her room. She's saying she won't forgive me if I let her dad miss what coukd be her last birthday with him.\n\n\n\nAm I being unreasonable or is she?", "created_utc": 1669117969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1rngc/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_daughter_invite_her/", "score": 2445, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She sees him at his friend's house where he's staying now.\n\n\nChristopher and I were planning her 17th birthday party at our house. Kelly told me that she'd like to have her bio dad come over to celebrate since he may not be able to be around next year. Christopher said no immediately. He said he won't let that man come into his house which made Kelly cry saying that we were robbing her of a last chance to make memories with her dad after finally finding him again. I told her that I don't feel comfortable having him come to the house and be in the same room as him. Her stepsister said that both me and christopher are overreacting and that Kelly wants her dad to take part in her birthday so badly. Christopher left the house and I snapped at Kelly and threatened to cancel the whole thing.\n\n\nLater whrn we calmed down I suggested she goes to celebrate with him but she said her friends and their parents won't be able to attend. She also said he can't throw her the party since he's sick. We had another argument and she started ignoring me and christopher while staying in her room.

I would either take her myself or get her to her dad's house and they would go together. \n\nIf she was with me and just randomly decided she missed her dad (or vice-versa), we would call the other, and if possible, we would make the switch. Sometimes she had something she wanted to talk about & only wanted her mom. My ex would bring her over and i would keep her that night. Point is, my daughter's needs and her comfort and stability always came first to both of us. \n\nI can't tell you how many parties I sat through where I wanted to be ANYWHERE else, but did it for my daughter. Her dad did the same.  We both mad compromises and sacrifices when we didn't want to be our daughter mattered more.\n\nMy daughter's dad passed away when she was 14.

This lets the daughter have the last chance with her dad, if this is what it is.  It lets stepdad evaluate the situation, see if it is safe and appropriate.  It lets the family celebrate together.  And it lets OP avoid direct contact with the ex.\n\nNow, if there is another complicating factor, such as past abuse, that's something that needs to be addressed.  First, the daughter must be told exactly why OP is so stressed by this idea.  Second, if there was abuse, then having the stepdad evaluate the situation is appropriate.  Third, if there was a history of bio-dad being abusive, then OP and stepdad should not have allowed the daughter to visit, at all, without one of them there to supervise.  Navigating interaction with an abuser is absolutely something a teenager can do on their own.  Just forbidding visits won't work if the daughter can use public transportation or drive on her own to get there.

I get having rules for a minor but that home is still her daughter's home too.", "I think OP cleared up that this wasnt an option or I would agree", "Exactly", ">I expect this is as much about Kelly wanting to spend time with her father, as it is about her friends and family getting to meet him.\n\nThen they should host the party at a different venue, with bio dad contributing to the cost since he's the reason why the party needs to move.\n\nBut I agree with everyone saying that OP should not be forced to ever welcome the asshole into her home. That is her safe space, her place to be comfortable, and if she isn't comfortable with him there then he should never be expected to be there.", "That's horrible!", "My mother had a cousin who faked a terminal cancer for years. Ironically, she really did die from cancer last year. Although, a different form than her claim.", "I'm really sorry he did that. My SO of 17 years did that too. It so hard to understand. I cut him out completely, but the last time I had to speak with him he was on his 5th terminal illness. Some people are just weird in the most hurtful ways.", "Right there with you. Except my bio dad did it multiple times over years. I finally gained the guts to go NC once and for all a year ago. This is just one of the reasons for the NC.", "My ex stepdad has had 3 months to live for the past 18 years. My little bro has finally realised he's playing with his emotions and just ignores him now.", "OMg how terrible for you guys. You have my sympathies. That is an awful thing to do to a person!", "Are you Chas Tenenbaum?", "Especially since it was the grandma that orchestrated all this.", "I wonder what happened in their relationship that the sight of him is unacceptable.  We might be missing some serious reasons as to why he isn't welcome in OP's life as of now. That said, if that is the case, she should have mentioned it.", "Exactly. Mom has a choice right now to either erode her own relationship with her daughter on the off chance of having an \"I told you so\" if biodad is being manipulative or just be a supportive mom who will still be there for her daughter when daughter either deals with biodad's death or lies.\n\nI know I would definitely rather position myself into the latter category. \n\nMom, YTA.", "She does see her bio dad though. I actually agree with OP and bio dad shouldn\u2019t be invited to the party. But doing an alternative arrangement with her bio dad seems like a good compromise. And honestly, if biodad is terminally ill he shouldn\u2019t be around groups of people anyway cause I\u2019d imagine he\u2019s immunocompromised. I say this as a daughter with both parents terminally ill with stage IV cancer.", "OP is not stopping daughter from having a relationship with bio-dad though, she even said that she will cancel the plans she made so bio-dad can throw the part, daughter does not want that", "She can, just not at op's house and OP's presence.", "Absolutely, I said in my solo post, she has that right. Children don\u2019t always understand what the other parent goes through when this happens. But she has to understand if the mother doesn\u2019t want to see somebody that ruined her life. If I was the mom, I\u2019d just miss the party, it\u2019s unfair to be upset at her when this guest, terminal or not comes with all this emotional baggage", "Maybe more in the comments and I didn\u2019t see that yet but in the post she says that he can\u2019t host the full party because he\u2019s sick, but surely her going to the store and grabbing a cake and some candles and going to him or his moms wouldn\u2019t be too much if he can attend a full party at her moms with no issue.", "Yeah, that's why I suggested OP finds out the truth and then make a decision. You know, as opposed to the asshole thing of -cancelling the birthday-.", "I had a family member that was like that. Every time you talked to her, she was dying of something. She \u201chad\u201d all sorts of cancers, heart failure, MS, lupus, Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, and a bunch of other things. Every time you talked to her is was something new and the last diagnosis was wrong. It went on close to 30 years. Then, she actually did get sick and die. (Only a few weeks from getting sick to dying.) everyone was like \u201cguess she was sick this time.", "Why should mom who put the n all the work actually raising the kid and organize the party and miss it so the dead beat (who may be lying about being terminal) can attend?", "> OP should find out from the father's family if the whole terminal illness thing is true and decide depending on that.\n\nDoes it really matter? If he is just sick or if he's actually dying, it doesn't change anything.  \n\nOP should not be expected to welcome him into her home no matter what, even if he is actually dying. And OP was TA for cancelling the party instead of changing the venue even if he's actually just sick but will recover. Assuming it isn't something contagious, of course.", "I agree with you, I don\u2019t think she should miss it at all. But if her own daughter is willing to grandstand and say she\u2019ll resent her if her father can\u2019t come, you gotta make the choice to be resented or just miss it yourself. The guy doesn\u2019t even deserve the right to call himself a father, I think the daughter needs to understand what he put the mother through for over a decade. Some of these comments approach it like she\u2019s just a child and they should put it aside for her and that\u2019s just not it. She\u2019s 17 years old, she\u2019s nearly an adult. She\u2019s old enough to understand what trauma is and why she shouldn\u2019t inflict any further into her own mother for the sake of a person that abandoned her"]}
