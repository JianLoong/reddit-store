Initially, we laughed about it, but after falling for a few guys and having it not work out, suddenly she started saying she was thinking about it. \n\nto make things weirder his brother lives in another country, doesn\u2019t speak English, is much older than my friend, has never been in a relationship, and doesn\u2019t know her at all. \n\nTwo months ago, out of nowhere, she tells me she\u2019s going to his country to marry him. I was shocked. I asked her why she wanted to do this, and she said she just wanted to be married.\n\nthough all of her family and friends tried to persuade her not to do it she took off, telling us she\u2019d at least be getting engaged, but the marriage could possibly be happening next year once he\u2019s immigrated. \n\nAfter getting there, she didn\u2019t message me at all or let me know what was happening, until a month had passed when (last week) she told me they were finalizing their papers. When I asked, what papers, she said their license to get married. They were to be married without any of her friends/fam present. At this point, she hasn\u2019t told me anything about this man, and as far as I knew, he had no plans for them after marriage and wasn\u2019t trying to meet her family and friends or get to know her life at all, which were huge red flags for me. While I was trying to be supportive of my friend, I couldn\u2019t understand this situation and was concerned for her safety and the finality of this situation. \n\nAfter she told me about this, I made a last ditch effort to stop her from making this decision, and told her that while I loved her and she was my best friend and I\u2019d always be there for her, I couldn\u2019t support her decision in getting married in this way (away from friends, family, secretively, in a country she doesn\u2019t know and to a man she doesn\u2019t know). 2 days later, I got a text from a mutual friend asking me if she was suddenly married and what was going on. I checked my Instagram but saw nothing, and realized she\u2019d blocked me, and gotten married without letting me see it or be a part of it at all. \n\nI confronted her about blocking me the next day, to which she responded I was an \u201cunsafe\u201d person and she didn\u2019t want me causing her anxiety, and she\u2019d blocked her mom for the same reason. She then said her now husband makes her feel safe and she didn\u2019t want to wait to be married, so she just went ahead and did it, and that was her choice and she thought I would be happy for her. I had no idea what to say to this, and thought it was immature. Now, she is supposed to come back and stay with me for a few days, but I can\u2019t bring myself to want to talk to her after she did this, blocked me and said the things about me she said. Is what I said deserving of her completely blocking me out?", "created_utc": 1696104057, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wgao9/aita_for_not_supporting_my_bfs_wedding/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is so fucking weird. But more relevant, being a good friend means saying \"This is fucking weird and you're being stupid.\"", "You were honest. You were kind. You expressed gentle concern. You just didn't validate her decisions. So, NTA. Life is short and people who only want to hear what they want to hear should at least pass out a script so everybody else can get on board with the shenanigans.\n\nIf she finds you \"unsafe\" and just not on her side, accept that her needs and yours are very different. You did her a solid. (I ask my friends to speak honestly to me so I don't make an azz out of myself believing I'm right when I'm dead wrong.) But, she isn't like me, obviously? And I'd tell her that reconnecting after she blocked you isn't making you feel \"safe.\"\n\nStand back and maybe stand by because this sounds like a snit snow waiting to happen, IMO? The good thing about my true friends is I can still love them even when I don't like them? But. sometimes friends have to take a break from each other to get some perspective and go forward. Give yourself a break this time.", "NTA but please continue talking to her even though you are hurt. She's likely going to need someone when this doesn't work like she wants it to and I hope you'll be there for her. \n\nAlso, how old are you guys?", "NTA, it sounds like she'd been chosen because she is young and going to pop out babies and be a household servant. The age gap is concerning and for friend it was fait accompli, done already. \n\nKeep an eye out, she will unblock you and talk about how horrible the marriage is and how isolated he is, MIL is a terror expecting her to keep the house clean and having no education she will not be able to do a lot. She will need you then", "NTA. She's supposed to come back and stay with you? But you and her mom are  are unsafe people? I'd be concerned someone else sent those messages and has her phone. You are wise to be concerned.", "NTA. It seems as though your friend placed so much emphasis on getting married being critical to her self worth, so if she believes this is her only chance to get married, anyone questioning the circumstances of this marriage is interfering with her achieving her goal is also interfering with her ability to be happy. I\u2019m not saying her behavior is what a medical professional would categorize as healthy, but it makes a degree of sense to me. Still, I hope none of this ends up being as toxic as I think it will.", "INFO: Do you have any idea what are her reasons in wanting to get married, and what is she hoping to get from this marriage?

If you\u2019re an \u201cunsafe person\u201d for her why would she come back and stay with you?", "NTA. Surely, she doesn't need to stay with you, if you are so \"unsafe\" to her that she needed to block you?", "She's being manipulated and you can't save her.  Get the info to her parents and let the rest go.  NTA  I hope she's safe too.", "NTA.\n\nyou were being a good friend and sharing your concerns with her. not sure what is going on with her friend, but she sounds extremely unstable. but why does she think that as an \"unsafe\" person (her own words) its alright for her to now expect you to help her out with accommodation when she couldnt even accept a simple concern from your side?  its completely understandable that you dont want to be around her and talk to her after how she dismissed your friendship on a whim.", "NTA. Your friend is making a terrible decision and is the one who is \"unsafe.\" I believe as a good friend, you sometimes have to do the hard thing and tell your friend a truth they don't want to hear to try to help them.
