If that were to happened to me, I pray someone works so what you did.", "Definitely not the asshole. You were keen enough to realize that this woman was receiving unwanted attention, and looked out for her.

I can be pretty insecure/jealous gf (I\u2019m heavily working on it!!) and I would be so proud of my bf for protecting another woman from a potentially horrible situation.

How would you even stop her from putting her arm around you without signaling to the psycho that he should keep pushing?

Then explained to your gf, instead of staying outside the whole time, and ordered the Uber there, but still absolutely NTA. Thank you for protecting her.

She should be grateful that you are a good enough person to stand up for someone being harassed!", "Nta. However, your gf is still feeling her feelings. Which were not wrong to feel.

Goodluck!", "NTA good job, she should be proud", "NTA.  You are a good guy.", "NTA- it's a shame that this kind of thing has to happen and the guy couldn't just take her no for an answer. But you did her a great service. If my BF did that when needed, I would just be proud of him.", "NTA. Honestly, I would rethink my relationship with the girlfriend if I were you. She's acting ridiculously jealous and possessive over you when you did a GOOD THING. That won't get any better with time.", "NTA, you did the right thing. Your GF is being immature.", "NTA", "She would have rather had that woman get hurt than go through her perceived betrayal of you acting like someone else's partner to protect them. NTA, also she's a bad person.", "NTA. I would hope that my husband would do the same. Nothing you did was out of order. My husband will sometimes help people on the side of the road or stuck in parking lots with their cars. It pays to be a good samaritan.", "NTA stay adamant that you did the right thing.

She needs to think about how she would act/feel if the shoe was on the other foot.", "NTA you were doing what you feel right in this situation. if you weren\u2019t there, who knows that would have happened to the lady. your girlfriend is most likely jealous, but she should see that you were also put on the spot and reacted appropriately.", "NTA I hope someone like you is around if my daughter needs a safe way out.

If I was in a relationship and some girl approached my boyfriend for help, pretending that they were together, I would WANT him to play the part. To me, it would show that he's a safe, trustworthy person, and it would make me feel very good about the person I chose to be with.\n\nYour girlfriend is sounds like the type that would shoo someone away and make it known she doesn't know somebody if she had been in your position. \n\nAsk yourself, \"do I enjoy being with someone who twists my innocent acts of providing safety for others as an opportunity to vilify and gaslight me?\" Maybe have another chat with her while you're both sober about why she's upset about you doing the right thing, and don't make her feel like you're weird or unloyal.", "Nta.

What you did shouldn't be necessary, but many men don't accept \"No\" from a woman until they see evidence that she's \"taken\" by another man.

In the moment being confused would make sense but after the explanation I don\u2019t understand how she could be anything but proud of him?", "NTA. It was really great what you did. I'd be hella proud of my boyfriend if he did that. Way to step up and help someone out of a frightening situation. Your girlfriend has issues, and apparently can't look past her own feelings.

That girl went up to you for help. but your girlfriend is not an asshole either, just insecure and jealous try just talking to her and potentially suggest therapy", "NTA. Your girlfriend most likely feels a little dumb after freaking out about a situation that was easily explained. Her anger just hasn't fizzled out yet if you get what I'm saying. Give her some time and she will come around. Good on you for reacting so quickly and naturally.

I think it's apparent from your point about \"not making a scene\" that generally, you two might be mature and conscientious people and it seems like you respect her judgement etc to a degree and this situation has thrown a curve ball.\n\nIt's not crazy or uncommon to react illogically and unfairly soon after she was upset by the visual of you with your arms around another woman. If asked in the abstract, I'd hope she would have wholeheartedly agreed to the good thing you did. \n\nHowever, she is your partner, and sometimes it's helpful to acknowledge that even though you did a purely good thing, she might be upset because the visual could have been pretty raw. It isn't inappropriate or caving to acknowledge that you see why she might be upset, without saying that you yourself are wrong. I'm getting the sense you may have been (justifiably) indignant at the accusation that you may have done something wrong, but kindness and understanding of your partner's illogical discomfort can be important. She probably wouldn't be happy knowing that you felt like this stranger could use a little extra support and a comforting arm, but that's not something you can say without looking bad because our society is so geared towards physical touch between opposite sexes being sexualized. \n\nLong story short, you did a good thing and should be proud and not apologize or take back anything, but it's also kind and human to acknowledge that even though you're right, a partner who loves you may be upset and inconsistent in this situation, and just because she isnt happy in these moments doesnt mean you should immediately break up with her (as others are suggesting). I think it could be useful to approach the situation with grace and make it clear that even though you know you did the right thing, you understand why she might have been upset in the moment. You don't have to \"lose\" or admit wrongdoing or say you wouldn't do it again, just don't bag on her for being upset without offering an olive branch. \n\nIt's an entirely different scenario if, days after acknowledging you can see why she wasn't jazzed, she still holds that you were wrong because thats asking you to be a shittier person to assuage her own insecurity. But as I'm in the business of assuming the best in people, I think she knows you did a good thing and might be prickly because she knows she shouldn't be upset. (Which, again, normal human impulse.)

You observe something weird is going on, you are confident in your melee capabilities, you vocally query the woman if she needs help, stare the creepy perp in the eyes the entire time, prepare for possible combat or domination, where he breaks eye contact and leaves.\n\n2. The path you chose. Using your high intelligence, and stealth capability to gain major exp, and save the lady. However, it exposes a significant flaw in your own relationship.\n\n3. Ignore your instinctual observations, and allow the perp to creep the girl. No exp, no hero cred, no issues with your old lady, who was spying on you from the window.\n\nIn my opinion, depending on my mood, I might have picked 1.  However, 2 is the most mature and injury avoidant choice, and you should be applauded by your girl, and not lauded.\n\nOf course this is based on the premise everything you say is \ud83d\udcaf and you do not have a history of lying to your woman.\n\nTherefore, the fact she was spying on you, seems. Mmm.. what\u2019s the word you kids use? Ah. Suss. Seems suss. And you might what to reconsider having babies with this woman, which is the ultimate goal, as well as long term viability. \n\nIf she cannot process you being a chivalrous knight, and using your intelligence stat over your strength and dex stats.

You were a perfect gentleman and protector and your gf is TA.", "NTA. Your girlfriend should be happy that you helped her out. Does she normally have issues admitting she\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m hoping that after talking to you she felt foolish for being upset.", "I mean, if your GF insists that you stop flipping it, it's obvious who's right in this argument.

It\u2019s not like you had the girl up against a car dry humping her.

I hate her.", "NTA. \nNeither of you are really. \nShe is just upset some other woman had her hands on you and that you showed what she probably considers \"intimate consideration\" for some random woman. She just loves you and is a little jealous and you should end it by telling her you are sorry if it upset her that you were concerned for another woman. That you can't promise you wouldn't do the same thing again and that you hope that someone would do the same for her if she ever felt the need to resolve a situation in the same manner.

She let go of you when he left and you didn\u2019t leave her out alone after a seeing she might not be safe staying outside waiting alone. \n\nIt is crazy to me she thinks she has any right to be mad when you did the right thing and when you ask her she is trying to gaslight you into thinking you are flipping the situation when at this point it is fair for you to ask bc besides her no one with a working brain would be mad at you for doing this for someone in danger. \n\nShe should be proud and happy to be with someone who would do that and not take advantage of the situation.

There needs to be more solidarity among women. I think she was genuinely upset, and then she genuinely realized that you did the right thing 100% to the T. Which made her embarassed for how she approached you, and (maybe do to the alcohol) she grasped onto the only thing she thought was valid, the touching... it wasn't valid btw. If the woman had not put her arm around you the ruse could have failed, and the man may have reacted poorly. You and/or the woman could have been injured. Her concern was fair before you explained the situation. But, honestly, anything other than \"wow, you handled that really well. Thank you.\" Would be a pretty f'd up response.

Like, \"what if that's a secret girlfriend?\" And, \"was my bf enjoying all of that arm holding/attention?\" The objective part of my brain would know how dumb that all is, but it would take a few days of me sorting out my feelings to get the rest of my brain to settle the f down. \nI'm just saying, maybe your gf is going through something similar.

OP doesn't need to continue asking the GF what she would do or how she would feel because he's already done that and she has answered irrationally.  OP should wait a few days and then ask his GF if she is ready to apologize to him for getting on his case for doing the right thing.  If she's not, OP should consider getting a new GF.", "So let's say GF says it's okay for you to pretend you know her but no touching. \n\nIf he had reacted negatively to her putting her arm around him do you think the man following her would have believed they were together?\n\nSorry but GF doesn't get a say in how he handles this kind of situation. If a woman putting her arm around him is that much of a threat, he needs to move on and find a GF who isn't so damn insecure.", ">you need to have a chat with your gf about how she would have wanted you to act in that situation if it ever happened again, so to not feel disrespected\n\nFuuuuuck that! SHE needs to put on her big girl panties and get the fuck over her boyfriend HELPING SOMEONE. OP should under no circumstances validate her hissy fit about saving someone from harassment just because they were a woman. WTF\u2026.", "A partner who would get jealous at that isn\u2019t one worth having.", "He arranged the Uber for her, so he's got her address. Maybe he should try dating her. At least she'd appreciate him.", "OP\u2019s girlfriend is not an ally to other women. That\u2019s seriously depressing that some women end up being so competitive towards other women.", "my thought too. NTA, but two weird points. 1: since the girlfriend saw (and even if she didn\u2019t), why didn\u2019t he mention it when he went back inside? like, \u201cwow guess what happened out there\u201d or something. 2: if she saw and had concern (or even if she didn\u2019t) why didn\u2019t she go out to see what was going on?", "Why is this downvoted!! This right here is the best thing to do!!!", "Only idiots would have a problem with what he did. He 100% would have been the asshole if he DID NOT help that girl.", "how in the fuck are they sus? Whats sus about it?", "I think just tell her \u201cuntil you can give me an answer for how you would like a guy to treat you in that situation if I weren\u2019t around, drop it. I\u2019m not going to let some vulnerable woman get assaulted because you\u2019re insecure. Are we clear?\u201d\n\nSometimes, you need to put your foot down.", "What you did makes ypu a Good Guy. Ypur girlfriend is ridiculous. I would be so proud of my husband if he helped a stranger in distress like that. NTA", "Well at least now you know you're dating someone who's more concerned with you being her property than the safety of another woman.", "Your girl sucks, and that\u2019s a major red flag.  \n\nEvery woman has been in that situation and she should be thrilled with how you handled it, and have empathy for the girl getting harassed, not pissed because some scared chick briefly touched your back.", "Why?\nIs she an insecure person? A jealous person? If she is, this maybe be the reason for no response. \n\n Does she love herself and has a rock solid self esteem?   If she does, you probably would have received a high 5. \n\nPeople from the first group are difficult (if not impssible) to have a relationship with. You deserve a girlfriend from that second group. \n\nI'm a mom. Thank you for helping that other woman. That's someone's daughter.", "that's cause she knows she's wrong and being irrational", "You were right to flip it. Make her put herself in their shoes and create empathy for the woman and her situation.", "Silence speaks volumes. She knows you did nothing wrong. NTA", "NTA at all. I'm disappointed by your girlfriend. Is she so insecure that she's unwilling to see you help a person in need?\nThank you for doing what you did.", "Op if my partner have done this and I saw him. I also would wait and ask him later. Then I would thank him for helping her. He could even kiss her cheek or something. \nYour girlfriend is insecure and is jealous. She knows what you have done was right thing to do, but is still trying to fight because of the jealousy. NTA.", "You absolutely did the right thing and I personally appreciate how you handled this. I think if I had had a boyfriend act like that, I would feel proud of him.", "I think you are a sweet, stand up guy. If my bf did that I would be proud of him. I understand jealously but if she can trust then your explanation should have squared things. NTA.", "NTA, you did what most of us women would have wanted and if your girlfriend can't see that then there is an issue with her and she needs help!!! Her having her arm around you just made her feel safer, I would be pissed if my hubby didn't do that!!!!", "Exactly, it's not like he got this girl's number and is literally ever gonna see her again. If OP's gf is so insecure she can't handle him helping a stranger in need for 15 minutes, she really needs to work on that or she'll never be able to trust anyone. \n\nNTA at all - I'd be proud of my bf if he did something like this and happy to have a partner who has compassion for the scary situations women go through instead of minimizing them.", "That's the point OP becomes the creepy guy...", "I can't believe I have to say this.. DO NOT DO THAT. I'm sorry but I would be terrified if I thought I barely escaped an assault to then find out that the guy who helped me has now shown up at my fucking house wanting a \"date\" in return for being a decent human and I have no idea what he will do if I turn him down because he knows where I live.. that is such a scary thought for a woman.", ">reassurance and continued communication should put this to rest.\n\nis why. How long should he be doing this?", "because AITA likes to pretend anyone who does anything bad ever is the literal devil.  but ty!", "[deleted]", "Not telling your girlfriend that you had to wrap your arm around a girl, not telling her that you bought a girl an Uber, not just leaving the random dude and taking the random girl back to your girlfriend and filling her in on what happened so she doesn\u2019t have to guess why her boyfriend has his arm wrapped around some random chick at the fkn bar.\n\nAlso, the only person who would be upset by my comment would be OP, so if you\u2019re fishing for confirmation on Reddit with multiple accounts, good luck \ud83d\ude02\n\nRelationships are built on trust & communication. Lack of communication deteriorates trust.", "Or because she wants confrontation, women love that!", "Yep, that was a strange reaction. You might want to gently back out of this relationship. I'm getting some yandere vibes. Obsessively jealous people are no fun to date at all.", "Ew I didn't even think of it like this. I couldn't imagine being jealous that my partner helped another woman. Something bad could have easily happened to her. I def agree that she sees him as property. \"Yeah you helped her, but no one's allowed to touch my boyfriend.\"", "Exactly this\n\n If she hadn't put her arm around him the guy following might not have believed it and it could have ended badly for both of them.\n\nI would never be angry or jealous if my husband did something like this. Even if it required a hug or a kiss on the cheek. Hell I probably wouldn't be bothered by a peck on the lips. Like your SO is never allowed to touch a woman not related to him by blood or marriage?\n\nWhat OP did was amazing!", "Reminder, girlfriend is under the influence of alcohol and is being emotional. Having this fight while drunk is probably not a fair assessment of her character. And while OP is logically correct, he could have used some emotional intelligence and realized that his drunk girlfriend is in her feels about a the situation and reassured her. Which is why she's complaining about him \"flipping the situation\". Unless girlfriend is a huge dick, she's drunk, hurt and just wants her boyfriend to tell her they're still good. People aren't perfect, if this isn't her typical behavior just chalk it up to alcohol fueled insecurity.", "Same!", "I feel the same way. If I wasn't deeply invested in a relationship, and found out my partner had pushed her away, I'm not sure I would be able to see them the same in the same light again. Even knowing they had been drinking. That is something only an extremely socially unaware person would do in this day and age.", "turns out girl code isn't as prevalent as we may have been led to believe.", "First off, men aren't generally in need of this kind of rescue from women. I'm not saying it's never happened but I've never heard of it happening.\n\nSecond, you're assuming OP is as jealous as his GF. You don't know that.\n\nAnd third, you're acting like this kind of irrational jealousy is normal. It's not.", "This.  Hormones are rarely rational.\n\nHaving said that, next time bring her into the bar, hand off to the gf and get management involved.  Better all the way around.", "This post actually prompted me to go and tell my husband that if he ever sees a woman in trouble like this he doesn't need to worry about me getting upset over him helping her. If she puts her arm around him or hugs him, I'm fine with that. And he told me he actually did end up holding a woman's hand once who was in a similar situation. I'm proud of him for it!", "True. I wasn't suggesting he actually do it, just that she clearly would appreciate that he'd protect another female.", "From the post, he hasn\u2019t done it at all yet. He just needs to remind her that she\u2019s loved, and let her cool off abs she should be fine", "You know, I wouldn\u2019t even say age did anything too bad. I mean, yeah, it\u2019s not great that she was jealous over this, but she also can\u2019t control her emotions, and I think she handled them quite well! She didn\u2019t do anything that could have put anyone in danger, and she didn\u2019t make a scene! She just brought it up later when they were calmed down. If she didn\u2019t, this could have been something that she pressed down and built resentment for over time, and then things really would be bad! So all things considered, I think she did the healthiest thing she could have", "You don\u2019t see the victim blaming in \u201cgirl stops going out alone\u201d? Seriously?", "So because someone might bash your head in with a bat at any time, you always wear a helmet? Since obviously every precaution ever needs to be made at all times no question asked.", "He did tell her lmao. Read. \n\nTaking her back to his gf would\u2019ve been weirder than just helping the girl get out of her situation. His girlfriend is irrelevant he was doing something for a woman\u2019s safety.", "Okay but Shrek absolutely would\u2019ve protected her. We all know that.", "Conflicting feelings are OK. Being selfish and taking them out on her boyfriend isn't OK. She needs to grow up.", "Not if that jealousy is telling him that he shouldn't have helped a woman being followed. He did the right thing. If she can't tell him what she would do, it's because she knows she's wrong but still wants to be irrational. I wouldn't feel jealous if my bf did this. He was just protecting someone, obviously its a tad weird she put her arm around him but in the end, they were both acting for her own protection. Nothing happened.", "Best answer,  right here.", "Shrek would, and I bet shrek is nicer too.", "Nah jealousy in this scenario is absolutely insane and invalid, she should get checked out for BPD.", "I think it works fine for healthy couples (not applied solely to the wife, of course, so \"happy spouse, happy house\" would be a more accurate version [that still rhymes]), for whom it's just a shorthand way of saying that they prioritize each other, and each cares about the other's happiness. The problem comes when the shorthand \"rule\" is applied to unhealthy couples, or in an unhealthy way. My father used to say it, but my parents were very much in love and very happy together, and each bent and compromised and accommodated and helped the other. A toxic marriage would be something very different.", "Yandere? Bro she's not gonna be killing people", "For real! I\u2019d be glad she got home safely and thanked my husband for protecting her. Like we need more men like this is the world.", "I'm going to give you one thing. OP said his GF is not the type to cause a public scene. She will wait. So...this is definitely not the first time they've had something happen and so yes he probably should have known how she would react because it sounds like \"not making a scene\" is a common occurrence for her.\n\nBut I would also argue that we don't know that she was dunk. She was drinking but was sober enough to wait until they got home before she started in.\n\nNothing the OP describes on his part was a reason for her to react the way she did once he explained the situation unless she is woefully insecure. And that's not his problem.", "Yeah, I would totally jump my husband\u2019s bones if he helped a stranger this way, and I would be pissed off if he *didn\u2019t* do anything. OP, you are NTA, you did the right thing. Hopefully your girlfriend gets over it quickly.", "I\u2019m saying that the initial jealousy and anger were totally rational, which they were. If pretty much anybody saw their SO being flirty/touchy with another person there would be some jealousy. \n\nI\u2019m not saying her *continued* jealousy/anger is rational, in fact, I\u2019m saying the opposite. It\u2019s still there, but she likely knows that it is irrational, and given time to cool down will likely walk back what she said.", "Yeah I think that probably would have been better, and with hindsight OP can keep that in his back pocket. \n\nMaybe even proposing something like that would be a nice way to broach the subject with gf about what would have been better.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Yeah, so I guess OP\u2019s girlfriend just has *Shrektile dysfunction.*", "He could have farted to repel the man. It would have been great.", "This is MY SWAMP", "She may very well come around. Sometimes people take a bit to finally come to terms with things, especially when they know they are wrong but don't want to be.", "Totally. If she hadn't put her arm around him it would weaken the foundation of their ruse. The man could have gotten angry, someone could have been hurt.", "Ummm, you can\u2019t say that? I\u2019m sure every person who has killed someone at some point had a person saying \u201cooo they\u2019d never do that\u201d lol", "I'm not going to make a public scene, that doesn't mean that the things I address with people in private are invalid.\n\nY'all need to have more grace with people. A lot of crap may not be \"your problem\", but you would have better relationships if you bother to care about other people's problems. Seeing as there's nothing to indicate this is an ongoing fight instead of someone being upset in the moment, determining someone is \"woefully insecure\" is ridiculous. Girl saw her boyfriend outside with a girl's arm wrapped around him, he then stayed outside for a while, then came in and apparently didn't say a thing about it until she asked later. I don't think OP did anything wrong, either in the initial incident or how he's handling it, but it's wild y'all can't figure out why his girlfriend might be upset about that situation and not instantly turn off that upset. People are emotional, it's just a fact of life.", "This.  Nothing newsworthy about good men.  Although if Reddit is to be believed it should make national news. Lmao.", "my husband has twice picked up vulnerable women walking on the side of a highway at night & made sure they got to safety! \n\nhe said he knew even offering to help like that would be terrifying for them, so he couldn't imagine the situations they were in that made them accept his help. \n\nthankfully he's the most non-threatening looking little nerd in a Toyota corolla lol.", "She'll walk it back until next time someone touches her property because this isn't likely to be limited to a single instance. Jealousy is an ugly thing.

Pranks are getting more and more unhinged.

She\u2019s jealous over a girl who her bf helped save from a creep. She\u2019s still gonna be jealous a few weeks down the road, I\u2019d wager.", "Are you okay lmao there's literally no accusations/proof of literal murder here, saying she's a yandere for being a bit upset is extreme", "Better relationships? Lol. You have no idea.\n\nMy husband and I just talked about this because I wanted to let him know beforehand that if he ever saw a woman in this situation he doesn't need to worry about my reaction. If she puts an arm around him or hugs him, even kisses him, he should do what needs to be done to make sure she's safe.\n\nAnd he told me he had already been in a similar situation once.
