If that were to happened to me, I pray someone works so what you did.", "Definitely not the asshole. You were keen enough to realize that this woman was receiving unwanted attention, and looked out for her.

I can be pretty insecure/jealous gf (I\u2019m heavily working on it!!) and I would be so proud of my bf for protecting another woman from a potentially horrible situation.

How would you even stop her from putting her arm around you without signaling to the psycho that he should keep pushing?

Then explained to your gf, instead of staying outside the whole time, and ordered the Uber there, but still absolutely NTA. Thank you for protecting her.

Goodluck!", "NTA good job, she should be proud", "NTA.  You are a good guy.", "NTA- it's a shame that this kind of thing has to happen and the guy couldn't just take her no for an answer. But you did her a great service. If my BF did that when needed, I would just be proud of him.", "NTA. Honestly, I would rethink my relationship with the girlfriend if I were you. She's acting ridiculously jealous and possessive over you when you did a GOOD THING. That won't get any better with time.", "NTA, you did the right thing. Your GF is being immature.", "NTA", "She would have rather had that woman get hurt than go through her perceived betrayal of you acting like someone else's partner to protect them.

My husband will sometimes help people on the side of the road or stuck in parking lots with their cars. It pays to be a good samaritan.", "NTA stay adamant that you did the right thing.

She needs to think about how she would act/feel if the shoe was on the other foot.", "NTA you were doing what you feel right in this situation. if you weren\u2019t there, who knows that would have happened to the lady. your girlfriend is most likely jealous, but she should see that you were also put on the spot and reacted appropriately.", "NTA I hope someone like you is around if my daughter needs a safe way out.

Move on.", "NTA-You were helping a girl to be safe and not end up as a SA victim, kidnapping or a homicide.

It\u2019s always been something that I am willing to do. If a woman is being cornered by a creep it\u2019s never wrong to help them out. My wife always used to tell me if something like this was happening (we used to go out a lot) and she would quietly ask the girl if they wanted help. She would then give me a sign that I was needed, and I would swoop in and save them. You did the right thing.", "NTA the world needs more guys like you.", "NTA. You\u2019re GF ITA.", "NTA. Give your gf some time. She was taken off guard with what she saw and emotions can cloud judgement even after a good explanation. Let her know that you thought of her if she would be in that position and would want someone to be there to help her if you're not there.", "Obviously NTA.  Her telling you to \"stop flipping it\" when you asked her what she would want if she were in that situation answered the question without answering the question.", "if you were my bf i\u2019d fucking thank you instead of getting stupidly upset lol. tell her to grow tf up and stop bitching bc i\u2019m sure if it was her she\u2019d most likely do the same.", "If there is a your GF is the arsehole button I\u2019m pressing that.

It takes A LOT to ask help from a male stranger in cases like this because we have no guarantee said stranger will be better than the person we are fleeing. \n\nSometimes when you are in danger of sexual assault you don\u2019t reach out for help in the moment because you don\u2019t know if the people around you are going to pretend it\u2019s not their business or make it worse. \n\nThanks for being a mensch.", "NTA and, from a woman, thank you.

Sounds like she thinks you grabbed her by the p*ssy", "look, I dont think its an issue but I think for most females it would be a dealbreaker. \n\nthe issue too is that most men wouldnt care. \n\nthe part i find weird is that the girl has no money for uber? and you paid for it? thats just odd because uber saves your card or she could have taken a cab home etc. \n\nits tough to vote here, ill probably go with NAH because you could easily have minded your own business. but \"playing along\" is okay with me too. her reaction is also understandable because you seemed to have been scammed financially too", "[removed]", "NTA. Your gf jumped to conclusions, got mad, and was ready to nail you when you got home thinking you would have some lame excuse, but got tripped up when she realized you actually had a legit reason for how you acted. But she still has all that pent up anger so rather than cool off or process it somehow, she tried to find any tiny thing she could label as inappropriate and still blame you for.\n\nI could understand that the conclusion she drew wasn't necessarily that unreasonable and accepting that you're wrong in the middle of an argument is very difficult, but the fact that she hasn't apologized and admitted she was wrong but instead is doubling down is a sign of immaturity. Idk if this alone is something to break up over, but perhaps reflect on if its a consistent pattern of her character to never admit being wrong or apologizing and do with it what you will.\n\nBut you were not wrong and NTA", "Yes", "NTA. What you did shouldn't be necessary, but many men don't accept \"No\" from a woman until they see evidence that she's \"taken\" by another man. Things could have gotten really ugly if you hadn't stepped up. If your GF doesn't understand this, she's lacking both common sense and empathy.

She can't answer you because it was upsetting for her to look out the window and be shocked like that. She knows it was the right thing to do..........maybe you guys should shelve it until she feels more calm. Although potentially another way for her to look at it is if that was happening to her (all too common for a lot of us females, sigh) wouldn't that be the outcome she would want? Ive been outside smoking while my SO was inside the bar and had creepers like this approach me. It happens.", "Definitely NTA, and as a woman, thank you for catching on and handling that situation the way you did. Like the biggest kudos ever for that.

Thank God she was there, and had zero problem with it.", "You did the right thing. You gf is being selfish and jealous.

You went overboard with the gallantry and fronting for the Uber after the danger had disappeared, but are otherwise blameless. OTOH, your \"girlfriend\" outed herself as a jealous wench.", "NTA. I guessed what was happening from the title, and the post confirmed my suspicions. Your girlfriend is insecure and jealous. How else were you supposed to convince the guy?
