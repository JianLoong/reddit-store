The drive is about 40 minutes for her. Because I knew she was coming and that she wouldn\u2019t come to the house afterwards, I brought our other three children with us. She went to hug our youngest (2 years old) who in turn freaked out. If you\u2019re not around her enough, she doesn\u2019t let you near her. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re grandma, nana, Jesus, whatever. My toddler will snap or go full attitude. Of course my MIL became angry about this. \u201cShe should want to be near me.\u201d I snapped. I told her if she made an effort to come visit frequently and stayed for longer then 30 minutes, Q would actually bond and get to know you. \n\nI figured she would understand. Nope. She tells me we should bring the kids to her, and she will bond then. So I snapped again. I tell her she is one person. She does not have to get 4 kids ready, a bag of what they may or may not need packed, then sit in the car with them about 40 min each way. That it\u2019s not as easy as her popping a book on in her kindle and driving. MIL didn\u2019t like that answer. I didn\u2019t stop. I said if she is going to make the trek up to see our 7 year old practice, she can drive 8 more minutes to our house and see all of the kids. She told me that she most likely wouldn\u2019t come back up again under such terms. \n\nDo I feel like an AH? Absolutely. I have dealt with her unwarranted commentary about our choices, the mockery she makes of my husbands career, my choice to be a SAHM, her denial of one of our sons being autistic, and so much more. My husband said not to feel bad. He told me to be happy because we didn\u2019t have to worry about visiting her for Mother\u2019s Day anymore. \n\nThanks for reading if you got this far.

My MIL tends to act the same.... always calling and saying \"when can I see my grandkids?\" (she lives 2.5 hours away), but never calling to say, \"hey! is there a time i can come visit?\" meanwhile, her ex-husband and her parents visit us every couple of months in addition to us visiting them every couple of months. When we set up a visit with her parents, she joins in on the visit but never initiates it. \n\nYou have a completely valid point and it sounds like she has the ability to come see you if she chose to. Also, half-sidenote, why is it such a big deal for her to ask your child, \"Can I have a hug?\" and if the child says no, ask if she can have a high five or something less invasive instead. She's just not meeting you in the middle on anything and your feelings are valid! Glad to hear your husband has your back.", "NTA. She doesn't get to force her affection on a child.

It sounds like this incident was just one of many, and the straw that broke the camel's back. It's not ideal that it happened at your son's event, in front of the kids, but I can understand why you said what you said in the moment. Boundaries are your friend.", "INFO\n\nWe're missing something.\n\nWhat's up with her refusing to come to the house?", "NTA.

Good on you OP for not putting up with the crap, and you are lucky to have a husband who has your back in these situations.", "NTA and good riddance", "NTA", "NTA. From the sound of her you should be grateful that she doesn't want to visit more often.", "NTA - You go Mama!  Always stand up for your kids' right to not be touched!!!  Too many people try to force kids to be physically affectionate when they don't want to be and it's a horrible precedent to set!  You did the right thing, and it sounds like good riddance if she stays away.", "NTA Its not your job to make sure she has a bond with them and should understand it's easier for her to visit than the other way around. It's selfish of her.", "NTA. I hope that she doesn't do that anymore at any of your children's activities.  It doesn't sound like she even paid any attention to the practice. \n\nYour husband is a rock star for standing by your side!", "You are absolutely NTA\n\nListen to your husband and look forward to a quiet Mother's Day without her \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA.

It is something that happens around the country. Generally, it is an equal distance between peoples houses. Like for you around 40 minutes.  But in her case the drive is actually 2 days uphill both ways and generally blowing snow all year round. So her trip is much harder than yours. This phenomenon happens all over the country.   It happens in my family also.", "NTA. If your husband has half a clue, it should be his job to deal with her always.", "NTA. Glad you were able to get that off your chest. Great husband for having your back.", "She always does the hug and affection guilt. I always remind my kids they don\u2019t have to hug anyone they don\u2019t want to. I hated it as a kid, and never wanted to have my kids feel weird or forced ever.", "I am newly pregnant and I fear my mother is going to be the way your mother is.", "Nope. Q is very clear about who can touch her or interact with her. Unfortunately it\u2019s a repeat every time of the same scenario.", "Funny how it works, huh? Q is more loving towards her speech therapist than her own grandma.", "I agree - it's important to think of all the ways her MIL has invalidated her feelings and decisions in the past.", "Honestly, the only excuse she has given is that she is old. My husband and her have a terrible relationship, but these are the only grandkids she is getting since my BIL is childless by choice. And I support that. He does the cool uncle role well.", "It almost sounds as though she favors the older child.", "Like usual, I would have kept my comments in my head. But today she had to make the comment about Q still not wanting her near her, and it came out. I feel bad about snapping at her, and am not happy that my kids were present for it.", "I know that others are saying ESH because of your \"snapping\" on her, but she has a long history of invalidating your feelings and choices. Personally, I would just continue about my business and if she wants to confront the issue, leave that to her.", "My MIL is .....ugh and my ex MIL was worse. Snap at her all you want, I KNOW what you are going through. NTA!!", "I hope you're able to create a new little family when your baby is born. It has been a very beautiful journey being able to raise my children the way I wish I had been raised. I am sending all the love & hope to you that you are able to have the same experience!", "Some people seam to think kids should automatically be ok with them bc they are related. Not how it works folks. And I wouldn't force it.", "I totally get that your younger child has a right not to be touched if she doesn't want to be touched ... but how awful a grandmother can your MIL be if's going to see a kid's hockey practice on a Sunday? I mean, she's clearly making some type of effort here.", "For one of four kids. I should have mentioned she doesn\u2019t go to our oldest daughters cheer or dance, or any of our other son\u2019s extracurriculars.", "Low bar.", "NTA. My MIL lives not even 10 minutes away and refuses  to even try to come see her grandkids. There\u2019s no room to visit where she lives and so we even offered to pick her up and she comes up with every excuse under the sun moon and stars to bail. So we don\u2019t try either.", "\nOu g u \n\n\nMmmi\nM iu. Oui", "In the spirit of generosity, is there a park or something midway where you guys could meet for picnics? Or one of those playplace fast food venues?\n\nShe's making some level of effort. \n\nI've got a difficult MIL, who has a strained relationship with all her children. The grandkids she has by her son and I are the only ones she'll ever know. \n\nIt's been cathartic for everyone to have me bridge the relationship through the kids.", "NTA and your husband is right. You don\u2019t have to see them anymore. Yay!", "NTA\n\nI highly recommend r/JUSTNOMIL. Your MIL sounds like she's 100% abuse and doesn't treat you or your children like human beings. She acts like you're all dolls or actors that are supposed to do what she wants. I'm not saying a maid, because she talks to you like you're a dog meant to perform.\n\nWhat does she bring to the table besides negatively towards you and your child's development? If she denies autism, couldn't she try to forcefully 'make' your kid neurotypical? Would you trust her alone with your children during an emergency? Why isn't your husband dealing with his mother and making  you do all of the work with her?\n\nMIL either plays by your rules or she doesn't get to see the kids. I recommend reading r/raisedbynarcissists for examples of your MILs behavior from the perspective of the children. She doesn't have to be a narcissist for you to read it, but there are numerous stories where the parents continue contact with a MIL like yours but with obvious expamples. Both subs I recommended might help you develop your opinion on the situation.", "NTA, but is there a way that all of you could meet in the middle?   Like go to a park, picnic and play?  I, too, have 4 kids, so i get the headache of it all.  It seems like there isn't much compromise, and if she wants to spend time with the grandkids, a little effort should be made.", "NTA\n\nYour husband\u2019s comment about being happy not to have to see her on Mother\u2019s Day kind of says it all.", "NTA\n\nYou held your ground and enforced your boundaries with this woman. Go LC and if she decides to keep being a witch go NC.", "ESH. Did she not just drive 40 mins to your son\u2019s hockey game. That is an effort. Maybe she doesn\u2019t go to your daughters cheer because it is at an inconvenient time for her. I do think she shouldn\u2019t be cranky that your toddler doesn\u2019t want a hug though. Grandparents are allowed to have a life outside of their grandchildren. I know my older sister gets cranky at my dad for not spending enough time with her kids but he works full time and has two children still at home that take priority.", "NTA - My MIL did the same thing - In 20 years of marriage, she came to our house 4 times.  In contrast to our quarterly visit (or more) with kids in tow.  We had been visiting monthly before kids.  That stopped when the first was born.", "NTA OP\n\nSeriously, my 4 year old understands the concept of consent with touch, to the point that when he went to hug his cousin (same age) yesterday and cousin said \"No hugs please\", my kid literally stopped himself arms extended and said \"OK, I love you\" then happily busted out the toys to play together. \n\nIf a 4 year old can get this, and accept that it's not a reflection of the relationship, a grown person should be able to as well, imo", "NTA. \nThe fact that your husband\u2019s reaction was \u201cat least we don\u2019t have to worry about visiting her for Mother\u2019s Day\u201d tells me everything I need to know about her personality and behaviour.", "It comes down to being this simple. If she wanted to be close to your children where they are comfortable being hugged and loved she would put in the effort not demand you force them to. Tell her to go fuck herself and with the extra time saved take them on a weekend camping trip or something.", "And her husband's perfectly happy with how it played out.", "hey i put my hand in front of me as a stop gesture at work today and said no high fives i dont like being touched by strangers no offense. he wasnt offended. he was an inmate but thats besides the point. i dont like being touched by anyone.", "ESH, and I feel sorry for everyone involved.\n\nThere should be a clearer understanding about the visits. It seems you find it easier for her to travel but has this been made clear before? Some people would find it annoying to have in-laws visiting all the time. However, this should be made clear in a relaxed atmosphere, not blaming each other for not being able to telepathically sense what the other one needs.", "Are you ok?", "NTA, my dad lives next door to me and my middle child (8) rarely hugs him. She's just not into hugs and kisses all that much. I have gotten permission to kiss the top of her head, anything else and it's gross. My dad will jokingly call her a meanie when she doesn't hug him, but then she laughs and runs off, it's an on going game with them now and she thinks it's hilarious. She should be respectful of how your child feels. Not everyone likes to hug as is.", "NTA!! MIL sounds awful and I have to say I\u2019m giving major brownie points to your husband for his response to it all \ud83d\ude06.", "I love your husband. NTA", "NTA and I like your husband!", "Run, don\u2019t walk, over to r/JustNoMIL. You\u2019ll get resources advice and tips on how to handle this. \n\nMy advice? Drop the rope. She\u2019s not your responsibility", "I love your husband. I\u2019m too old for such nonsense myself so I\u2019m shocked at your MIL. She is acting less mature than your 2 year old who understands body autonomy. \n\nTisk tisk tisk. I\u2019d love to have tea with your MIL so I could dress her down myself. \n\nNta", "Dont just invalidate the childs feelings, if the kid doesn\u2019t want to be touched by someone who barley visits by choice when given the opportunity then its the mil fault. Just because she came a long way to see the child doesn\u2019t mean the child has to accept her affection, basically Mil thinks she\u2019s entitled to affection she doesn\u2019t deserve."]}
