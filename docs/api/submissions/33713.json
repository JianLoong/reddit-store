With remote working she can work in NY from the farm.\n\nSurly the farm and the countryside would be a far better place to raise kids.", ">As a wedding present my grandparents gave us the farm\n\nI hope that doesn't mean it's shared property.", "YTA that you\u2019re not willing to consider it. \n\nI\u2019m guessing this is not the first time she\u2019s brought up that she\u2019d like to move to the city? Why do you feel your wife\u2019s desired living situation is not worthy of consideration?", "NTAH- If these values misaligne, then maybe you should tell her that is not something you are willing to do. I know it is hard, but if you move to the city, then you will be unhappy, and that is not fair, just as it's not fair, she is unhappy. I would say if you feel this strongly, y'all may need to go and be happy without eachother. I am very sorry, but do not be unhappy, either one of you.", "NAH - but you do not have to sell the farm in order to move to a big city. This was an inheritance from your grandparents or a gift whichever way you look at it. If you don\u2019t want to sell it then don\u2019t. But you can also still move to the city and give it a try without selling the farm. If it would fetch quite a bit, I\u2019m sure you could probably lease it out or rent it out as well without absolutely letting it go.", "NAH\n\nShe's a city girl, you prefer the farm life. This is a conversation y'all need to have without blame or shame.\n\nAnd not on reddit.", "YTA for not even considering it. She's lived where you wanted for the last 7 years. Now she wants to live somewhere that's more her speed. If you want to stay married, you need to listen to her, talk it through, and consider what it would be like to live somewhere else. Maybe you'll find somewhere else new to both of you that's small enough for you and big enough for her. Maybe you'll decide you no longer want to live in the same place, and decide to part ways. But refusing to engage and communicate with your spouse is definitely AH behavior.", "Your life is like a  reverse Green Acres.", "I would not sell it .You have not really been married that long .What if you divorce ? Hang onto the Farm \u2014land prices will only increase .You can rent out the land and make money .NTA.", "NTA.   \nShe married a person who was part of a multi generational farm, she knew what that meant.   \n\n\nIt\u2019s not your farm. It\u2019s your family\u2019s farm. It is for them over the years. If you cash out now what are you going to do with that wealth to provide for your future generations. It\u2019s not \u2018yours\u2019 \u2026 it\u2019s generational wealth for your family into the future. Buying an expensive house in the city so your wife can work somewhere elsewhere\u2026 how does that build generational wealth? (It could, but make that the plan)", "YTA\n\nNot for wanting to stay on the farm, to be clear. But for your specific question: AITA for *not even wanting to consider this*?\n\nIf it\u2019s important to your wife, then yes, you should at least consider it. She\u2019s been on the farm with you for seven years and now wants to try something else. At least consider it.\n\nIf after that you both want different things, then make the decision you both need to make. Good luck to you both.", "NTA but this is a fundamental difference and might mean you two are not compatible.", "INFO - was it discussed before marriage that you will receive the farm as wedding present. And with it the responsibility to maintain it/be bound to this place? Or was it a surprise wedding gift?\n\nIt's a difference in it being discussed that the farm would be in your hands right after the wedding/you were tied down by it, contrary to her rightfully expecting to be more free to choose where to live (especially with a job she couldn't get far with in the middle of no-where) and suddenly being bound to a place she might not like. \n\nEither way, it only changes it from N-T-A to N-A-H. She gave it a try for 7 years and it seems like it is not for her. Maybe she didn't know, maybe you spoke about it being temporary. Either way, if you want to keep the farm and she wants to leave, you need to discuss it quite extensively or, in the end, might consider that you are incompatible in this.", "Where\u2019s the farm and how much land we talking? Might buy it or lease it off you to work something out it if it could benefit us both! lol \n\nAlso, NTA. There is no more land being produced so that\u2019s a commodity that is rare!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How does that solve the problem of her wanting to MOVE TO A CITY?  Reddit is hilarious with the comments that come up.", "It depends. If you value art, culture, diversity, live performances, car-free living, bookstores, and a wide variety of activities and lessons for your kids\u2014then the city is far better. My husband grew up rural (and we lived part-time rural and urban for a long time) and is soooo grateful that my son has had so many of the opportunities he didn\u2019t. As an intellectual and Jew, he did not feel like he fit in in his tiny town.", "So, the only reason the wife is the TA instead of it being NAH is you personally hate the city?", "Where does it indicate that she \u201cknew what that meant\u201d? I have in-laws who have a multi generational family farm. None of their kids want to be farmers. The plan is that when the parents die, they\u2019ll sell the farm and the kids will split the money. Not everyone who grows up on a farm becomes a farmer or wants to. And there\u2019s not a lot of money in most family farms these days."]}
