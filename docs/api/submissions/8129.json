You had two choices, fire him or tell his mom. Of those two options, firing him is more likely to help him grow up.\n\nAt this point, I would give him mom the list of deliverables he was assigned two weeks ago and ask her which of those she thinks were too difficult for him to accomplish or to vague to understand.

It does sound like he needs some structure and help, that should be her job.", "NTA. But your friend sure is.

If it was a professionally guiding conversation, then you did all you could.", "NTA. This kid should have been thanking you profusely every single day for the opportunity to have this work experience. He should have been the first at the office, and he should have done everything that was asked of him. Your friend, his mother, should have ALSO reiterated that he was incredibly lucky to get this internship and he better do his job.

Students are allowed to turn in work any time up until the end of the year.\n\nOne of the many issues is this structure does not reflect the real world. At work, you\u2019re not able to push your deadline to the end of the year.

A friend of mine has a son who is a senior in high school who decided to take an internship this school year to fill two of his course slots for the year. She asked if I would let her son do his internship with my company.\n\nBecause we are a for-profit company, in our state we are legally required to pay interns, so this is a paid internship which costs us money for every hour he is clocked in.\n\nAt this point we are about halfway through the school year. The intern has not accomplished any of the tasks he was supposed to\u2014not the fun interesting ones, and not the ones he views as tedious. He spends his time talking to other employees in ways they find distracting, or surfing the internet. He has met literally zero of his goals.\n\nAbout six weeks ago I sat him down and had a serious conversation with him about the need to actually focus on and deliver the things he has been asked to do. There was no appreciable change. Two weeks ago I changed his deliverables to things which were much more straightforward and also extremely easy to see progress on. He continued to browse the web instead of doing the job.\n\nSo I fired him this week. \n\nNow his mom, my friend, is very upset because this jeopardizes his grade in his class and could create problems with his college admissions process. She says my expectations were too high and I should have spent more time supervising him and giving him more structure and help. It\u2019s true that I gave him tasks and expected him to work on them without needing constant supervision, but it doesn\u2019t seem to me like that\u2019s unreasonable. And perhaps he\u2019ll learn something valuable by being fired for not doing his job.\n\nAITA for firing him?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Involve the supervising teacher if you want to also.  Lay it all out on the table and let the son explain to mom why he got fired .", "NTA.", "NTA Although I would suggest adjusting your sour attitude about being forced to pay interns \"costing you money.\" Ideally, with an intern who actually does the job, it would be costing you money but you would be getting their labor in return, like any other employee. Unpaid internships allow employers to get free labor.\n\nHOWEVER there's no way I would have put up with a paid employee slacking for 8 weeks. I would have had a talk with him much sooner and fired him sooner, too His mom should be grateful he got paid to do nothing for 2 months instead of mad at you.", "NTA, if his own behaviour is creating problems with his college admission then maybe he should not be admitted to one. Also I have no experience with american colleges but I would assume nobody is sitting next to you day and night to make sure you study and do the adult things expected of you?", "NTA. Your friend failed to teach her son what it means to be responsible. Now she's expecting you to be irresponsible too by continuing to pay someone who is not doing his job.\n\nThe only thing I can say is that you might have given your friend a heads up first, like, \"Listen, I really don't want to do this, but if your son doesn't start actually working, I'm going to have to fire him.\" Maybe you did that and it didn't make it into the story, but either way, you're NTA.", "NTA sounds like you handled it the exact same way you would for any other intern. You're being expected to show favouritism but instead you've likely taught the kid a good lesson.", "NTA. He is old enough to know right from wrong. He is old enough to follow what you wanted him to do. You didn\u2019t ask for him to go get the moon, but asked for simple tasks. He refused to do anything and was annoying the employees. He\u2019s an asshole. His mom is an asshole for thinking you ruined his future when the kid did that all on his own.", "INFO: Did you share that if he didn't meet his goals, you would fire him? I feel like it's pretty standard that when having a conversation about poor performance, you also detail what happens if nothing improves. But his mom sounded blindsided. \n\nIf not, ESH. Obviously he's responsible for doing work at an internship and is old enough to understand that. But you did agree to take him on and more steps could have been taken, including talking to his mother before you fired him (especially since he was hired as a favor to your friend).", "YTA. You should have talked to his mom, your friend, before making a decision and giving her an opportunity to influence his behavior.\n\nHigh schoolers are kids, they can be surprisingly inept when it comes to achieving tasks, so you should have expected this would require more handholding by the company.", "NAH.  Nope, you aren't an asshole, and neither is disappointed mom.  Give it time; you may have given the intern the best lesson they could have gotten:  feedback and consequences.  Mom will either get over it or she won't (and, she is after all, mom).", "The extent of regular supervision from the school is validating a weekly time sheet.", "That\u2019s not the \u201cemployer\u2019s\u201d job.. he agreed to a paid internship, he did not follow through. Have his mom do that.", "We are a small company. We do not have a stable of interns; we typically have between zero and one interns. Previous interns have done fine in accomplishing their tasks.", "What makes no sense is that this is an internship to receive school credits - which suggests there should have been regular oversight from the school to make sure program requirements were being met and the students were safe. \n\nBut the OP mentions zero school involvement.", "I don't think OP is an asshole, but it's worth noting that in the US (which is where it sounds like OP is located), the purpose of interns, even paid ones, is not to generate revenue for the company. in fact, legally speaking, it's understood that interns may actually hamper the work at times because they're supposed to be learning. that's why they're interns and not employees.", "Not defending the kid but that\u2019s a bit rich. Surprised you don\u2019t think he ought to wash the bosses car for free every weekend", "No. We have had other interns before. One was eventually hired into a permanent position, others have done fine and gone on to their next adventures. He is the first intern I have fired.\n\nI would note that we are small enough that we never have more than one intern at a time, and usually have zero.", "I kinda doubt the kid understands why he got fired.", "I actually don\u2019t have a problem paying interns, or anyone else doing work for the company! But I wanted to clarify that this was paid rather than unpaid, as many people seem to assume that interns are unpaid and therefore free to a company.", "On the one hand, sure OP could have called mommy and said \"hey, your son is about to get himself fired, and here's why. Maybe you can help.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the kid is on the cusp of adulthood, and needs to learn that mommy won't always be there to fight his battles. \n\nBased on OP's description of mommy's reaction, I'd wager that she is all too eager to fight the kid's battles.", "It is a for-profit company not a kindergarden. If he needs constant handholding maybe that is where he should be.", "High schoolers are kids, but they can also be surprisingly (or not surprisingly, if you assume that at least some of them are capable) adept at achieving what they put forth effort to achieve, especially high school seniors. Someone who's one year away from college (where his hand will not be held) can reasonably be expected to complete assigned tasks.   \n\n\nI'd feel differently if this kid wasn't getting paid and wasn't causing a distraction to other people in the office, but he'd been wasting time and resources for his entire tenure. It doesn't sound like he was learning the things he was meant to be learning for the course credits, either.   \n\n\nIf he'd completed literally zero of the work asked of him at any given part-time job, he'd have been fired long ago. OP is NTA.", "Huh why? I had jobs in highschool none of my bosses would have called my parents if they had an issue with me and one of those bosses was my neighbor.", "You're basically saying he should have shown nepotism by getting his friend, kids mum, to influence his behaviour. What other company would call the mother of an intern to ask them to get their child to actually do the work they're being paid for? Besides that, teenagers aren't well known for following their parents instructions they're usually a bit more busy doing what they want and testing what they can get away with.", "My mom (and dad) would have said \"Well, that sucks and I'm sorry it happened. Bet you won't make that mistake again!\" And they were right.", "That's not how school internships work. The employer is the supervisor.", "What was he learning by not doing anything exactly?", "Hahaha, no but I hate the entitlement. What the fuck? He not only got an internship thanks to mommy but a payed internship????? And he was playing on the computer all day? That\u2019s beyond the pale. You know how hard it is for kids without connections to get these types of opportunities?", "He's being paid and not doing anything else so even if he washed the car, it wouldn't have been for free.", "Then NTA. I thought maybe you didn\u2019t know how to train interns, but if this kid is just expecting a free ride it makes sense. Can\u2019t imagine the mom is going to forgive you if it really causes a delay in college admission, but the kid should be held accountable, not you.", "Would you have let him go on if it wasn\u2019t costing the company money (an unpaid position)? Just curious.", "Maybe, but company shouldn\u2019t have hired him into an internship if they were not prepared to support his learning. They were not obligated to hire him, but once doing so they have a commitment to look after the intern to some degree. And socially, OP is friends with the intern\u2019s mom. Assuming there\u2019s a desire to maintain that friendship, firing her son without warning isn\u2019t a great idea.", "Maybe I should have said ESH, because I\u2019m not trying to give the kid any credit. But a friend is not going to be your friend for very long when you fire their son without a heads up.\n\nPeople have to behave in ways that recognize others have feeling and emotions. You can\u2019t simply behave like an automaton based on what is fair. EQ vs IQ.", "This job was setup as a personal favor to OP\u2019s friend. Seems different to me.", "Hiring the kid in the first place was nepotism. Contacting his mother is not nepotism - you seem to be confused.\n\nDo you expect OP\u2019s friend will stay their friend after this?", "I agree that he wasn't learning anything and OP wasn't wrong to fire him. interns are still supposed to do their tasks and learn. I was just making a general note that interns are not there to generate revenue.", "Fr, god forbid someone have to put in some actual effort when someone gives them an amazing opportunity to show gratitude and prove their worthy of it. It\u2019s not just entitlement, it\u2019s narcissism and arrogance. NTA at all", "If, as OP described, the kid was talking to the paid employees in such a manner that distracted them from their work, then yes, after appropriate counseling and attempts to correct the problem. \n\nI have no issue with holding conversations at work - indeed, \"no talking\" rules are stupid - until those conversations prevent me from working.", "He had a meeting with his boss about his work attitude, his tasks have been simplified so that he could achive at least one thing. He did not. He was disturbing other workers and surfed the internet all day, he was obviously not interested in learning anything and a company is not obligated to pay someone who simply refuses to work", "I agree that it's generally dicey to mix business with friends' kids unless you know the kid and their work ethic very well. That's on OP and the kid's mom. \n\nWhat I don't agree with is that OP should have spoken to the kid's mom about this. OP spoke to the kid about it, and the kid elected to continue to fuck around, which naturally led to the kid finding out.", "I guess to me it doesn't, end if the day it's business, mom got him in the door it's his job to keep it.", "Why wouldn't they remain friends? Why shouldn't they? I don't think OP did anything wrong. \n\nHe gave the kid a chance, and another, and another...  The firing didn't come out of the blue. \n\nA 17-year-old is more than old enough to understand actions and consequences. He's also old enough to not have mommy fight his battles. OP had no need or requirement to tell mommy that little Billy is fucking up at work and is about to get fired."]}
