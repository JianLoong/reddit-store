My boyfriend told me I probably shouldn\u2019t talk about it at the dinner, and I said I wouldn\u2019t so long as it wasn\u2019t brought up. Cause I don\u2019t want to lie. \n\nTheir father insisted, so I pulled him aside to tell him that I worked at a coroners office, and I didn\u2019t think his kids would want to hear about it.

Saying that was sorta like a detective who figures out how people died. \n\nThis might be where in the asshole. After dinner, the oldest kid talked to me one on one and started asking me questions about it. I tried to keep it as PG as I could, but at one point he asked me if I got to cut open bodies like on TV. I said that it was a bit outside my pay grade, but I helped. He thought it was awesome, and ran off. \n\nI guess he told his siblings about it because today I got a very strongly worded message from their mother about how I \u201ctold her young children about how I played with dead bodies\u201d and now their youngest is terrified. Apparently she\u2019s mad at my boyfriend too for dating someone with such a dark job. \n\nI was just answering a kids questions.

And I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s my fault his siblings found out. My boyfriend\u2019s upset too because he thinks I should\u2019ve just not talked about it.

Having to figure out the deaths of people, (assuming that they are fucked up deaths), can't possibly be easy. There was no logical reason for the mother to get involved, and i ***HIGHLY*** doubt that the youngest kid was \"terrified\". It sounds more like the mother making up excuses to make you feel bad about yourself.\n\nGG OP. Don't let the haters get to you.", "NTA. Their father said that the kids were mature enough to handle you answering their questions and you did your best to keep the answers appropriate for their age. It\u2019s not your fault that one of them decided to tell the others more detail about what you did. You need to have a conversation with your bf and let him know exactly what happened and make sure he understands that you had his uncle\u2019s permission to answer the questions you were asked. Ultimately you did the best you kid and had parental consent for what you did. If he or his aunt want to be mad at someone they should be mad at the uncle/husband and not you.", "NTA. You avoided the conversation as long as possible because your boyfriend was uncomfortable, and it was only on his father's insistence that you told them about it. Also, there's nothing 'dark' about what you do. It's an honest job.", "NTA you tried to not talk about it. If you had of stayed quiet they probably would have assumed it was some type of sex work otherwise why not say something. I think you handled it the best way you could.", "100% agree! Death is only so stigmatized because we don\u2019t talk about it! It makes it, and everyone involved with it, this dark, unsightly thing", "Honestly I don\u2019t really give a damn what she thinks of me.

Kids are so difficult and I never know how to react to them. They\u2019re so hard to deal with. \n\nAnd thanks for that second part too! It\u2019s usually not pretty, and it can be really heart breaking. But it\u2019s worth it if I can help families find peace", "I know it\u2019s an honest job, but a lot of people consider it to be like, not something for casual conversation. Honestly I get similar reactions that my friend who does sex work gets lol", "Then you need to sit down and have a serious discussion with him about why he is so bothered by it. This is something you want to spend your life doing, he needs to be supportive/understanding and on board, or he needs to find a partner with a profession that he can support.\n\nIt's not fair to you if he's gonna get squicked by your job. Does he expect you to never talk about this stuff?", "That sounds like a guy who really is not worth spending a future with.

Also, your boyfriend can be more supportive and read the situation rather than get pissed over this", "I\u2019d explain to her you only did so after the express permission of the boys father, and that you expressed your concern and he insisted it was fine.

You did everything you reasonably could have to keep the conversation age appropriate \n\nAnd the thing about not liking him dating you for your dark job is immature and silly. I think ignore it.", "NTA\n\nKids adapt very easily. I gather it's more the mother's troubled relationship with death's inevitability that's the issue, but what is traumatizing/triggering to her isn't necessarily the same for the kids.\n\nYou said from the get-go that you will not lie if asked, and you did as stated. Your boyfriend knew that, not sure why he's clutching his pearls now.\n\nAlso, you have an amazing job. Not for everyone, but pretty badass.", "NTA, not at all \n\nYou did absolutely everything right. You got their Dad\u2019s permission, and did your best to keep it child-friendly. It\u2019s unfortunate that the youngest child is scared of what you do, but that\u2019s not your fault. \n\nYour bf and his mum have a lot more to answer for. His mum\u2019s reaction is ridiculous - your career choice might be a bit morbid for most, but there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about what you do for a living. \n\nFurthermore, your bf needs to learn how to live with you talking about your work. What are you going to say when he\u2019s introducing you to other family members?

If the mom should be mad at anyone- it\u2019s her husband \n\nAnd how dare she speak poorly of you for being in a role she considers \u2018dark\u2019. It\u2019s highly respected.  Maybe her son isn\u2019t good enough for you and you can do better. \n\nWhat would she prefer? Only fans?", "NTA and woah, your boyfriend was mad because you were insisted to talk about your job? Red flag.", "NTA boyfriend needs to grow up as does his cousin.", "NTA, but your boyfriend and the kids' mother are. You had permission from the kids' father to tell them about it, so you did.

If she doesn't want you to talk about it infront of her kids she has to make that clear to you BEFOREHAND and answer all the questions that come up herself.

The dad asked you and said you should. It sounds like what you told them was quite minimal and you have no control over what they say to each other about you.\n\nIt sounds like the oldest one has got creative with it when talking to the younger ones about your conversation. Their mum should be annoyed with the dad and the eldest, if anyone.\n\nYou partner shouldn't be annoyed either. You said you wouldn't talk about it unless asked. You were asked. You stuck to what you said.\n\nBut what the hell is up with the mum saying he shouldn't date someone with a dark job? Does she think the whole world is sunshine and rainbows? Does she think everyone wants to work in a shoe shop or bakery? You are doing something not everyone can do but it needs doing. It's a higher educated job and a respected field.\n\nThe only other thing you could maybe have done is to refuse to talk about it even with the asking, but then that might seem kinda rude and snooty. I am a fan of science and truth. I tell my kid the truth about things while I know someone who tells their kid that when people die they go to live on the moon. I would be happy for you to tell my kid a pg version of what you do and why. Maybe if you had spoken more to the younger ones they wouldn't be scared. Big bro will have embellished it and made it grizzly.", "NTA. This is not a job to be ashamed about. And there is nothing wrong with telling children that sometimes you have to figure out how people died for obvious reasons. The boy was 13 and he had seen it on TV so what's the harm? And even 8 is old enough to understand and not being freaked out. The mother is a drama queen and your boyfriend should have your back.", "NTA. You took every precaution, from how you said it to when you said it to making sure the parents knew before you said it.", "NTA. Seems like the mother has bigger problems with your job. Who knows what the oldest child told his siblings, that's out of your control. By the way, physicians open bodies, too, and there are people who clean human excrement. Will she judge her boyfriend if he dates them as well, because their jobs are not suitable.", "If you don't mind me asking. What's a death cafe?", "I think there is a good chance the youngest is terrified. Because I have an older brother. I absolutely think that the older brother intentionally freaked out his little brother. I mean it\u2019s sort of his purpose in life.", "You\u2019re NTA completely. It\u2019s wrong to expect anybody to lie. It\u2019s especially important to not lie to kids. Except for very few circumstances that are entirely irrelevant for the situation at hand. 99% of the time don\u2019t lie to kids and that 1% of times is ll insane crazy doozies. Not a crazy doozie. Honesty from adults is important for childhood development. Ask a pediatric trauma specialist.", "Probably smart, but I don\u2019t want to apologize.

It\u2019s how we start, it\u2019s where we end. Not talking about it just makes more problems! It\u2019s like how poor sex ed just leads to less safe sex. Not talking about death just makes it less comfortable to talk about! And now whenever I take any sort of pride in my work or say that I find it interesting or want to talk about it, people say I\u2019m insane!

I think he\u2019s just squeamish about the whole thing and wants to pretend I don\u2019t do it", "Haha I\u2019ve used that line more than a few times. I guess he just wants me to say that I work with detectives or something? Which is technically true. It\u2019s still silly to me that he expects me to lie about it.

It's ridiculous and alarming that your boyfriend is also mad at you. You are doing a job that is needed and has a very important place in society. She should be taking this as a chance to educate her children, instead she chooses to act this way.\n\nAnyones wierd reactions to someone's job is their problem to deal with, that goes for you and your friend in sex work. I'd be looking into why your boyfriends reaction to this is to blame you. He knows what you do for a living and should be supportive.", "I was curious myself so I looked it up.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Cafe\n\nSounds like a pretty interesting concept tbh", "I won\u2019t agree with the posters above me about how your bf is handling this. TBH it does sound like your bf has lived a sheltered life and has death anxiety though. Many people who haven\u2019t lived around death do have similar anxieties. It\u2019s not abnormal but it\u2019s something to investigate within your partnership perhaps.", "I don't think you need to make a further apology. It wasn't your doing that the kid was traumatised. You told an older child a PG version of your job. However the kid decided to embellish to his younger sibling was totallly out of your control. If it's brought up again, mention that you spoke to the dad and he said it was ok. End of. If their eldest thought it funny to fuck with their sibling to the point of having nightmares, maybe they should teach their older kid not to be such a dick to the younger kids, instead of blaming it on an outsider.\n\nP.S Your job sounds cool af, I'd love the opportunity to do that sort of work.", "Then he isn't a boyfriend worth keeping. Your job is NOTHING to be ashamed of. My sibling is going into a similar field.

I refuse to sugar coat or lie to my daughter. I have taught her it's okay to be sad and grieve. It's okay to need a day or two to process and wallow. I don't hide when I'm sad. In this house we feel and process our emotions, all of them even the ugly and painful ones. My MIL has a progressive disease that will only get worse and we may not get another Xmas with grandma. When asked if grandma is going to die I had to explain that there are a lot of factors in that but that she's sick in a way drs can't really fix and we don't know if she is a candidate for the surgery that might give us more time, so we need to love her and spend as much time as possible with her to make memories that will carry with us because tomorrow is never promised. My daughter is almost 7 and has a greater understanding of death (and coping mechanisms for it) than most adults.", "my guess, your bf is embarassed because his aunt did not contact you directly, but via HIS MOM, and he may getting flak from both directions.\nmaybe a way to sooth the waves, if you don\u2019t want to talk to aunt is to ask his mom, about what came to her attention.\nOR (being totally pragmatic) ask HIM what exactly he is upset about, and establish if he is viable bf material, able to deal with others reaction to your job.", "people can be assholes. unfortunately, while most people understand the job is necessary, they have some messed up ideas about the type of people it draws to it. your mil clearly has those ideas and has let it her paint some misconceptions of your character.

It's impossible for you to have known that the 13-year-old would tell his siblings what he asked you, even though you made every effort to avoid the subject for as long as you could. The youngest one will be alright.", "It sounds like death freaks him out which is fair but you directly work with death so it\u2019s incongruous to be in a partnership with someone who can\u2019t handle the topic at all. I really do think you can help him become more comfortable with the inevitability of it all but I\u2019m not sure if these conversations are able to be had or if you\u2019re wanting it at all. Some people can really compartmentalize their work from their personal life. I\u2019m not that way but if you are that way that\u2019s good too. Everyone has a different mechanism of life operation.", "Yeah I\u2019m getting sick of him.

Always nice to see someone who has a similar interest", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking too. Plus I don\u2019t think his mom is too fond of me honestly. I appreciate your advice!

It was really appealing to me but forensic pathology is just more interesting to me. Less procedural, I guess", "No worries", "NTA, tell his mom that her husband gave you the go-ahead and wash your hands of it. I don't love that your boyfriend wants you to not talk about your job though; it's a normal part of the conversational flow and being cagey about it is just going to make kids *more* interested, as you saw firsthand.

I dated someone who processed urine tests, and he didn't know how much he smelled of it even after changing clothes because his nose had acclimated to it. It took a shower to get rid of the odor. But if you're doing whatever works for your colleagues and he still complains, it's probably his imagination associating the smell with your job.
