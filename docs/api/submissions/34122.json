Including his young cousins (8, 11, and 13). I was sitting across from their father during the dinner and one of his kids asked me what I did for work. I said it probably wasn\u2019t very good to talk about right then. \n\nFor context, I\u2019m in college studying to become a forensic pathologist and I intern at my local coroners office. So, I work with dead people. It\u2019s a tough job and I know for many it\u2019s an uncomfortable topic but I focus on the good im doing, which makes it a lot easier. My boyfriend told me I probably shouldn\u2019t talk about it at the dinner, and I said I wouldn\u2019t so long as it wasn\u2019t brought up. Cause I don\u2019t want to lie. \n\nTheir father insisted, so I pulled him aside to tell him that I worked at a coroners office, and I didn\u2019t think his kids would want to hear about it. He said her kids were mature enough to handle it, and seemed offended that I thought otherwise. I took his word for it, so I tried to give a child friendly description of it. Saying that was sorta like a detective who figures out how people died. \n\nThis might be where in the asshole. After dinner, the oldest kid talked to me one on one and started asking me questions about it. I tried to keep it as PG as I could, but at one point he asked me if I got to cut open bodies like on TV. I said that it was a bit outside my pay grade, but I helped. He thought it was awesome, and ran off. \n\nI guess he told his siblings about it because today I got a very strongly worded message from their mother about how I \u201ctold her young children about how I played with dead bodies\u201d and now their youngest is terrified. Apparently she\u2019s mad at my boyfriend too for dating someone with such a dark job. \n\nI was just answering a kids questions. He was mature enough to ask about it, and he clearly already knew it happened, so I don\u2019t really see the harm in telling him the truth. And I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s my fault his siblings found out. My boyfriend\u2019s upset too because he thinks I should\u2019ve just not talked about it.

Kids can handle very complex subjects as long as they are described in an appropriate way. I am assuming OP did that. \n\nThe youngest could have their fears assayed by explaining that OP helps to catch the bad guys by following the evidence and this is part of it (and you know, parent) instead, they blame it on OP. \n\nSMH.  \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, you warned the dad and told him discretely, he said to go ahead and tell them. This is a problem between the parents, not you. If she pushes it anymore, let her know you warned their dad and did not want to share the info until he asked you to. It clearly isn\u2019t something you take lightly and it\u2019s not like you were giddy about it or something weird like that.", "NTA. You tried to avoid the topic as long as possible, and there's no way you could've known the 13 year old would tell his siblings what he asked you. The youngest will be fine.", "NTA. You had reservations at first, but the children\u2019s own father assured you it was okay to discuss. It\u2019s not like you were showing them autopsy photos on your phone. \n\nAs for the mother, how dare she judge what you do for a living, particularly you\u2019re providing essential services that pretty much everyone, directly or indirectly, will eventually have need of. She\u2019s probably one of those people who gets offended when people say \u201cdied\u201d instead of \u201cpassed away.\u201d Too many people try to sugarcoat and sanitize death, to the point where it\u2019s not really discussed. They hide it from their children, and then wonder why their kids are either terrified or fascinated by death. It\u2019s like talking to them about sex. You can have an ongoing, age appropriate dialogue about death with your children", "NTA. It's sad that your boyfriend doesn't understand that you tried to avoid the conversation but maybe I'm just missing context. You should probably clarify that you were approached by his sibling and that you tried not to bring it up. You did nothing wrong, kids are naturally curious and you answered his questions.", "I attended a death cafe and realized how much ppl don\u2019t discuss death in life until someone passes .i think it\u2019s healthy to have discussion and openness", "NAH\nno more traumatizing than telling about a butcher, a garbage worker or any other job. \nAs you put it, the kid was \u201eold enough to ask about your job\u201c but obviously not old enough not to tell his siblings about it. There might be an A H move / behaviour on his part, but i d say that is just kids being kids.\nConcerning the mother you may:\n- want to TALK directly with her abiut what exactly you said, or\n- pass the bucket \u201eYour husband INSISTED in having me tell your kids about my job.\u201c", "NTA: They asked, you ran it by the parents, you told the oldest, and were not at all in control of what the oldest did with that information (especially if he ran off to tell his siblings).\n\nHonestly, I think your boyfriend is a bit pathetic to not be taking your side on something that is obviously not your fault at all. Like, obviously, his youngest cousin is terrified, I get that. But surely, he's old enough to take an objective look at the situation, think \"okay, the kids are terrified. But she only told the oldest, and the oldest told his siblings. That was out of her control. And even then she ran it by my father first. She did everything right in this situation\".

However...\n\n***THEY ASKED THE QUESTION. YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION.*** The kid at the table absolutely knew what he was doing. You were just trying to have a one on one chat with him and he basically just goes and tattles on you to everyone. (Kids really are little shits lmao).\n\nIt sounds like you are amazing at your job. Having to figure out the deaths of people, (assuming that they are fucked up deaths), can't possibly be easy. There was no logical reason for the mother to get involved, and i ***HIGHLY*** doubt that the youngest kid was \"terrified\". It sounds more like the mother making up excuses to make you feel bad about yourself.\n\nGG OP. Don't let the haters get to you.", "NTA. Their father said that the kids were mature enough to handle you answering their questions and you did your best to keep the answers appropriate for their age. It\u2019s not your fault that one of them decided to tell the others more detail about what you did. You need to have a conversation with your bf and let him know exactly what happened and make sure he understands that you had his uncle\u2019s permission to answer the questions you were asked. Ultimately you did the best you kid and had parental consent for what you did. If he or his aunt want to be mad at someone they should be mad at the uncle/husband and not you.", "NTA. You avoided the conversation as long as possible because your boyfriend was uncomfortable, and it was only on his father's insistence that you told them about it. Also, there's nothing 'dark' about what you do. It's an honest job.", "NTA you tried to not talk about it. If you had of stayed quiet they probably would have assumed it was some type of sex work otherwise why not say something. I think you handled it the best way you could.", "100% agree! Death is only so stigmatized because we don\u2019t talk about it! It makes it, and everyone involved with it, this dark, unsightly thing", "Honestly I don\u2019t really give a damn what she thinks of me. This is on her husband and kid, but I do feel bad that one of the kids is upset now. The only real issue now is my boyfriend. I think he might be embarrassed, or feel like he\u2019s being judged for my job", "Thank you! I\u2019m really frustrated at him honestly. He\u2019s a caring guy 99% of the time but as soon as my jobs brought up he just suddenly has a change of heart", "I love that show haha", "Thank you, I\u2019m glad you agree lol. Kids are so difficult and I never know how to react to them. They\u2019re so hard to deal with. \n\nAnd thanks for that second part too! It\u2019s usually not pretty, and it can be really heart breaking. But it\u2019s worth it if I can help families find peace", "I know it\u2019s an honest job, but a lot of people consider it to be like, not something for casual conversation. Honestly I get similar reactions that my friend who does sex work gets lol", "Then you need to sit down and have a serious discussion with him about why he is so bothered by it. This is something you want to spend your life doing, he needs to be supportive/understanding and on board, or he needs to find a partner with a profession that he can support.\n\nIt's not fair to you if he's gonna get squicked by your job. Does he expect you to never talk about this stuff?", "That sounds like a guy who really is not worth spending a future with. Like, a good boyfriend would be a caring guy 100% of the time full-stop, your job being brought up would make no difference in that whatsoever. \n\nI think you should either have a conversation with him or just curb him. But either way, you deserve a hell of a lot better than this OP", "His dad literally gave you the green light to tell the kids. Whether or not they consider your work to be 'dark', they (your boyfriend's parents) need to be on the same page before putting a guest in such an awkward situation. Also, your boyfriend can be more supportive and read the situation rather than get pissed over this"]}
