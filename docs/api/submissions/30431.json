My grandma (80F)  has started asking questions about our planning process and she seemed pretty relaxed about it at first. Until the conversation we had today\u2026\n\nToday she told me what her guest list was going to be. We are planning a relatively small wedding with only the people closest to us. This means no extended family or family friends I\u2019ve only seen once in my life. However, I am planning to invite a couple of my grandmas friends that were a big part of my life growing up and almost like second grandparents to me. Well her guest list was \u201cjust the four couples we go out to dinner with\u201d which included people I\u2019ve only met a few times when I was a child. I know it\u2019s not that many extra people but I feel this is a hard boundary because if we make some exceptions we\u2019ll have to make other exceptions to be fair to the rest of the family. I told her the guest list was finalized and we did not have room for anyone else and she got upset at me and called me cheap. \n\nI tried to make her feel better by saying the bridal party is only going to be 6 people total and that sparked another issue. She asked whether my 14 year old cousin would be my maid of honor. I told her that she is too young to plan things like the bachelorette party or be a witness and sign our marriage license and that I would be asking my fianc\u00e9s SIL (32F) as I am very close with her. \n\nThen she asked about the ring bearer and how I needed to let my cousin (7M) do it. I told her we had already decided my fianc\u00e9s nephew (3M) would be the ring bearer and she said that I need to let them do it together. \n\nShe told me that I am being selfish and excluding my own family but I feel closer with his family since I spend more time with them.
