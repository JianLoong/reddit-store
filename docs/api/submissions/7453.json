They make him uncomfortable. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a sensory thing or what, I didn\u2019t pry, I just accepted it and accommodated to make my partner happy. It was a bit strange at first but nothing I couldn\u2019t live without, and ever since we have never kissed around the general mouth area, but he\u2019s completely fine with cheek/forehead/etc kisses.\n\nNow: We\u2019ve (27M and 25 NB) been together for five years and he\u2019s proposed! We were recently talking wedding planning and I mentioned a thing that my mother did in her wedding scrapbook. Scrapbooking is a very important hobby to me and something that helped my mom and I connect before she passed, in her wedding scrapbook she has a picture of her and my dad\u2019s kiss at the alter and on the paper surrounding where the photo was placed, the bridesmaids had kissed the paper and signed their name beneath the marks using the same shade of lipstick they had worn at the wedding. Even a few of a groomsmen left their own kisses with borrowed lipstick (she laminated the page for sentimental and sanitary reasons). This is a thing I\u2019ve wanted to do for years, even before I got into scrapbooking, simply because my parents look back on that photo so fondly and it was super cool to see as a child.\n\nI mentioned to my fianc\u00e9 that I wanted to do this in my wedding scrapbook, and he went \u2018but won\u2019t that be kind of weird since we won\u2019t be kissing at our wedding?\u2019 I was absolutely dumbfounded and asked what he meant, and he went on to reiterate that I know he doesn\u2019t like mouth-kisses and he didn\u2019t want to do it on his wedding day. \n\nI asked, \u2018not even a peck? what are we supposed to do at the alter?\u2019\n\nHe literally replies, and I mean this is a DIRECT QUOTE: \u2018I dunno? Maybe a hug or high-five or something? We still have time to figure it out.\u2019 And left the room. \n\nI have brought it up twice since, and explained that not only is this important to me, but also it would be incredibly embarrassing for us as a wedded couple to just high-five and then walk down the isle afterwards. And it\u2019s not like i\u2019m asking him to make out with me, or do the stupid \u2018ring the bell and the couple kisses thing\u2019 I just want a standard kiss at the alter and hopefully a good photo of it.

Holy shit I'd be mortified to high five my wife at the altar. That's embarrassing", "Does he have issues with intimacy?", "Hmmmm\n\nNAH\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for wanting to be kissed but you said you accepted him never kissing you. \n\nHe is NTA for not wanting to kiss you as he told you in the beginning. \n\nInfo - how is the rest of your sex life?\n\nEdit - I ask this only because \u201cif you\u2019re waiting until you\u2019re married\u201d then you may be up for a very non sexual, non affectionate, non touching life. Forever.", "Nta but I\u2019d rethink this entire relationship. I married a man who wasn\u2019t affectionate at all except for right before sex and at first I thought I could live with it. After all he showed me he loved me through his other behavior. But it ended up being a very loveless marriage. I remember vividly one moment after our divorce when I asked someone in a pet store if I could pick up their puppy and I started crying when it buried itself in my neck and snuggled me. I hadn\u2019t been \u201cheld\u201d or loved on in years by that point and the affection I got from a stinking puppy broke me.", "NAH, Is his dislike of kissing so intense he can't accommodate for one moment at your wedding? I feel there has to be something deeper here if it's so horrible to him he can't even fathom doing it once... Edit: You need to know his reasoning because this is obviously bothering you, and he won't budge so it could be serious. This is probably info you'll need...", "NTA.  I couldn't live with this.  Think about it before you marry him.  No. Kiss. Ever.  No matter what.  It doesn't sound like he said that before.  He only said it made him uncomfortable.  Now he's clear.  If it isn't ok, it might be time to slow things down and re-think it.  I would need to know what is behind it.\n\nI thought N A H, but when I saw that he wouldn't talk about it, that tipped it.  I believe in boundaries.  All the same I would want a real conversation about it.", "NTA stop the wedding planning & get couples therapy now!", "I am not trying to be rude but this would be a deal breaker for me, I honestly don\u2019t know how you made it this far with person.  \n\nNAH but damn", "Probably NAH honestly?\n\nYou're not in the wrong for wanting to continue a tradition and get one quick peck on the mouth at your wedding for a photo. And you're not pushing for him to suddenly be okay with mouth kisses all the time, or anything. You've been very accepting of it, and that's great.\n\nSadly, it might be time to pry (gently, not demanding and all that) about what the aversion is. It could go much deeper than a sensory thing, in which case his reaction makes no sense. But without knowing that, him refusing to discuss it with you and shutting the conversation down puts him close to AH territory imo. We all do things we don't care for or even actively dislike now and again, so I don't see why one quick kiss for a once-in-a-lifetime event is so bad.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve agreed to go your entire life without mouth to mouth kisses. That is a significant sacrifice. You partner can deal with this one single kiss.", "NTA but you need to have a deeper conversation with your partner about this. Would this deeply affect the beginning of your marriage if you didn\u2019t get kissed and have that moment? \n\nWould you resent him for not conceding on this? \n\n(Also I really want to know why he doesn\u2019t like this. Does he have bad oral hygiene???)", "NTA. Based on what you wrote, I feel like you have sacrificed a lot for this relationship. I also think you will lose out in the end, and are honestly losing out right now (though you don\u2019t realize it yet). There are more likely much more compatible partners out there for you.", "NYA.    Drop the ah, find someone normal", "NTA but I am confused if there is no intimacy then why bother getting married and why not just be friends. Sorry this is strange to me", "NTA but please stop being dishonest with yourself. You want a relationship that involves mouth kissing and your current partner/fiance won't give you that. There is someone else who will. Break up and find that person.", "Just for clarity, are either of you asexual?", "NAH. You\u2019re not an asshole for wanting this, but he\u2019s not an asshole for having this (seemingly odd) boundary either. \n\nViolating his autonomy about it to fulfil your needs isn\u2019t the way to go. You guys need to perhaps work out a halfway point. \n\nI\u2019d also be asking what the deal is here, and suggesting perhaps this issue is explored in therapy \u2014 cos going your entire life without kissing your partner is going to be a bummer for you, and you need to work out now if you\u2019re compatible or not.", "YWBTA if you forced him to do this since you agreed to the no-kissing rule. If you truly are okay with a life without kissing your SO (a thing I can't imagine doing), then do a different photo, like him kissing your hand, which could be very romantic.\n\nBut more importantly, ARE you okay with this? And has he made any attempt to explain why he's asking you to give up a crucial part of intimacy? I feel as though the wedding photo is just forcing you to face this situation, and that perhaps a couples counsellor could help both of you drill into this and at least understand why before you commit your lives to each other.", "NTA - Don\u2019t marry a person who is *this* unable to read you/see your side of things.", "Info: have you considered couple's counseling. Because you should.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNAH but you need to sort this out completely before marriage.", "INFO: the act of kissing, even if it isn't slobbery making-out, is an act of intimacy. Do you not need that to engage in other acts of intimacy?", "NTA. He is not the man for you. Move on", "Is your husband neurodivergent?", "YTA for trying to marry a man who won\u2019t kiss you and not even ask why.\n\nYou aren\u2019t ready for marriage.", "Up high! Down low! Too slow!", "NTA. You have gone above and beyond to support your partner. You deserve the same. I wonder if he is able to put himself in your shoes. You are entitled to a kiss.", "YMTA.  If he's been years of feeling uncomfortable about this, my first question is why?  Is it a general preference, or is there a trauma trigger related to it.  If the second no question YTA.  \n\nI personally don't see why a cute cheek kiss wouldn't still suffice for the photo described as a compromise?  The ESH option is on the table because you've said he refuses to discuss it at all and find that compromise together.", "NAH\n\nI think it would be helpful for you to understand why he can\u2019t even do a peck at your wedding. \n\nIf he just can\u2019t, a photo of him kissing your check could be sweet? Still a \u201ckissing\u201d photo.", "YTA. He has been very up front since the beginning that he doesn't like kissing on the mouth. Why did you think it would be any different on your wedding day? It's *his* special day too, do you want him to be uncomfortable?\n\nand of course you're not gonna high five each other- you took his not great, off the cuff suggestion and ran with it. I'm sure there are really lovely alternatives you could do to kissing on the mouth, and I think you could still come up with a version of the page from your mom's scrapbook.", "YTA. He was upfront and honest with you about his feelings about mouth-kisses from the beginning of your relationship. \n\nYou chose to marrying him knowing that this was his preference, so why on would you expect that preference to not impact your wedding? \n\nHe\u2019s cool with forehead kisses, that could be a sweet alternative that would still look loving in pictures.", "YTA he told you from the start that\u2019s a boundary for him", "**YTA**\n\nI'll be honest, I was going to say N-A-H, but the more I read other judgements and the more I thought about it, the more I realised that YTA, and this is why:\n\n>I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a sensory thing or what, I didn\u2019t pry, I just accepted it and accommodated to make my partner happy. It was a bit strange at first but nothing I couldn\u2019t live without.\n\nExcept that apparently you can't live without it. Because you're changing the rules suddenly, all because \"it's your wedding\". But you never told him that was your expectation, that you could respect his boundaries . . . except on celebratory occasions?\n\nBut say it wasn't about that. Say it wasn't about your expressed embarrassment at the idea of him kissing you on the cheek or high-fiving or whatever at the altar. Or about crossing what is clearly a really uncomfortable physical boundary for him because \"wedding day\" (which, I get that it's a special day but it's still a really arbitrary reason to stomp on someone's physical \"this makes me uncomfortable\"). Say you really HAVE just realised suddenly that you're not sure you can live the rest of your life without being kissed on the mouth . . .\n\nYou'd still be TA because you've been in a relationship with this man for FIVE YEARS, love him enough to say yes to MARRYING him and spending the rest of your life with him . . . but didn't care to inquire into why something that is an expression of deep affection for most people makes him deeply uncomfortable. You say you \"didn't want to pry\" but that's one thing when you're dating a month; when you've been together for years it's not prying, it's learning to understand your partner's needs, vulnerabilities, the things that make them feel safe and unsafe and why. And you just . . . didn't do that? I don't get it. \n\nYou've accepted it all this time. You've given him reason to believe that you have no problem with it. Now you're changing the rules without ever even bothering to find out why he said \"please don't\" in the first place. YTA, and I'm not sure you're ready for a lifelong partnership.", "YTA. This was a boundary for him from the jump.", "Yta\n\nHe is right. He made his boundaries clear from the start and you accepted it. Why do you keep pushing him? Why are you so surprised? If he doesn't want to kiss you then that's it. He doesn't want to.\n\nCan't you compromise on the matter? You say he doesn't mind cheek or forehead kisses so why not settle for that?\n\nBut you would definitely be ta if you kept pressing the issue and be like it's my way or the highway. The wedding is for both of you, not just you.", "YTA: Since the beginning, it's been a known issue.  Now you can't respect it?", "He\u2019s not an AH for not wanting a kiss on the lips given that\u2019s a sensory thing HOWEVER he is for seemingly not letting there be a kiss on the cheek.", "YTA for knowing he had an aversion to kissing on the mouth, not having done so together for five years, then assuming he\u2019d be ready and willing to do it at your wedding in front of an audience.\n\nI think the scrapbook concept would work just as well with a photo of a forehead or cheek kiss. One of my fave wedding pics is of my husband kissing my hand (on which he\u2019d just placed my wedding ring).", "YTA. Your one special moment doesn't have to be entirely 'ruined', you could do a forehead kiss, cheek, anything, but if he's so against kissing on the mouth that you haven't done it your entire relationship, then why force him to do something that he can't stand at any point?\n\nThe bigger question here is, should you even marry him. You seem to think this is just some odd, he'll be fine eventually, type thing, and you aren't taking it seriously enough to even bother asking him why?  This is your life for the rest of your life. If this is something that is a hard and fast rule for him, seriously consider it for your future. It's not a him thing or a you thing, people are allowed to decide if they don't like a certain type of touch or action, but I don't think you're really looking at an entire lifetime of never kissing. \n\nIt's time to talk about this and anything else that you've set aside before talking wedding details", "Slight YTA... I don't blame you for wanting an 'iconic' photo. \n\nBut.\n\nThis is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with and whose wedding day you are sharing. If a kiss would make them so uncomfortable that it would materially change their impression of the day, I think you should respect that. \n\nA high-five photo actually sounds pretty fun and cool. \n\nHere's a spur-of-the-moment idea. Would your fiance object to 'kissing' a sheet of paper or some other material?  Maybe they would participate in the creation of a scrapbook memory that wouldn't stress them and you can still have a scrapbook memory. Or, if you high-five, put some handprints in there. \n\nSure, it would be cool to recreate this if your fiance was into it, but since they are not, make your own riff on it. It's a day for both of you and if mouth-kissing isn't part of your relationship, maybe it would be more meaningful to have something that your fiance could wholeheartedly contribute to.", "YTA, not for wanting to be kissed, but for expecting him to cross a boundary he has been up front about from the beginning. Why should he have to do something that makes him deeply uncomfortable so that you can immortalize it in a scrapbook? It is his special day too, and you need to respect that and his boundaries. If the no kissing suddenly is a deal breaker to you you need to think about what that means for your relationship BEFORE you marry him.", "ESH. Is he neurodivergent? I would want to know the why behind this before I tied the knot. Are you satisfied with the other aspects of your relationship ? Physical and emotional?", "YTA. Your entire relationship involved no kissing because he doesnt like it. You can continue the tradition your own way. Too many of these arguments happen because if the parents did it, it must be the right way. Your marriage is not your parents marriage. Do the tradition how your unique marriage is. And yes hi five is a dumb idea. Figure something else out!", "YTA\n\nThis is a well-known boundary of his. You're asking him to break it for a scrapbook photograph.", "YTA. You know he doesn\u2019t like it. You\u2019ve accepted it enough that you agreed to marry him. But you thought you would do it on the wedding day for some reason? If you guys never kiss why would you on your wedding day? It\u2019s his wedding too and he should be comfortable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I just want to throw out there that people who have been sexually abused, particularly very early on before they had words for what was happening, can have an aversion to specific physical acts or parts of their bodies being touched.  (There could also be something like a twist on a germ phobia going on here.)  If this man is able to have a normal sex life with the OP apart from his aversion to kissing, and she's comfortable with this being absent from her sex life and expressions of affection, who is anyone else to tell her this isn't acceptable in a marriage?\n\nThe scrapbook and the kiss at the alter (which could be finessed by turning away toward the alter and maybe also holding up the veil as if modestly to provide privacy) aren't very big deals in the context of a marriage to a man the OP has loved for years and wants to marry.\n\nIf, OTOH, the fiance's aversion to kissing is emblematic of something bigger and profoundly serious, such as withholding, in the relationship, OK, reconsider.  I'm wondering, though, does he see this as a problem or as trauma related?  Is it something he would want to explore in therapy (with the OP understanding that the purpose of therapy can't be for him to be able to kiss her on the mouth unless he sees this as his goal in seeking treatment; it might not be either his goal or attainable)?  Is the OP just upset at the prospect of being embarrassed at the alter, or is she actually upset about a lifetime commitment without kisses on the mouth?", "NTA...but...altho I think the high-five thing is cringe, I understand a long, tight hug as an option and maybe a kiss on the cheek.  It's very hard to understand people who aren't into certain types of physical affection but I'm one of them.  You can see by comments that people are trying to see it as unnatural, calling for therapy, etc and that's just a lack of understanding. I feel for you and your fiance both, I hope you do find a compromise.", "Not trying to pry, but are you sexually active? If you aren\u2019t having sex now, have you spoken about how intimate you will be after marriage? You need to know if he has any interest in sex. He may be non-sexual. If he has no interest in sex, you need to decide if you want that kind of relationship with your husband. Good luck!", "Soft YTA. I do understand that it's your wedding day and something you are looking forward to. However, if kissing like this is something you agreed to never do in your relationship, I don't understand why the wedding would be different.\n\nI know you have been looking forward to that photo. Like you said your parents look back fondly on it. But will that be a memory your husband looks back fondly on? Being pressured into a kiss he wasn't comfortable with for the sake of a photo op and keeping up appearances?\n\nThe fact that you talk about how embarrassing it will be not to kiss at the altar is what changes this from N A H to a soft Y T A for me. Your wedding should be the one day that is 100% about you and your partner as a couple, not having to bow to other people's expectations. If that's what you are worried about, I think you need to do some reflection before getting married. Are you ready to commit yourself for life to this man who has told you he will never consent to mouth kissing? Are you ready to support him 100%, including if family members were to ask about that part of your relationship? If your answer is anything other than yes, I don't know that you are ready for marriage.\n\nAnd if the answer is yes...the first step to supporting him is not pressuring him into a type of physical affection he is uncomfortable with on your wedding day. \n\nAnother comment had a great suggestion of doing forehead kisses instead. I think it would be beautiful for each of you to take a turn kissing each other's forehead. You would get two photos instead of one! And more importantly, those kisses would be genuine expressions of love, rather than something forced.", "YTA. So you already knew this about him and still want him to feel uncomfortable?", "Maybe forehead touch, with intertwined fingers. It's sweet, makes for a good photo and is intimate.", "YTA\n\nFor thinking he would change, or he didn\u2019t mean it, or wedding would be an exception. I guess it\u2019s perfectly normal to expect a kiss at the altar. However, you needed to listen closely to his boundary-setting statements, and take them to heart. I think you were in denial about his not wanting to kiss.\n\nKnowing about the family photo, why didn\u2019t you discuss this more thoroughly in the beginning? You\u2019re wanting to marry a man without fully knowing about a major issue. You are the red flag \ud83d\udea9 in this situation. \n\nDo you really think you can go through life never kissing your husband? Not for Valentines Day or your anniversary or NYE? \n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me. The instant a man tells me this, I\u2019m out. \n\nHard to believe this is a real story, honestly. But maybe he is a germaphobe or has abuse issues related to mouth kissing. Who knows.", "So do you just tell the officiant we don\u2019t want the \u201cyou may now kiss the bride/groom\u201d ?????  Does this maybe have anything to do with you as NB? Like he loves you and was attracted to you to date you but then he learns you say NB not female so he\u2019s all twisted???

And maybe therapy?? \n\nBut if the kiss won't happen, what about an Eskimo kiss? That's when you rub the tips of your nose together. It's a little more intimate than...a high five...", "Why should his wedding be the place where he makes accommodations that make him uncomfortable? Like, sure, it could be that he's just pathologically unable to kiss, and the request is an impossibility, or it could be that he just really doesn't like it, but I can't really see why the latter is illegitimate. This is a big lifetime moment or whatever. Why should it make him feel like shit?", "This would be a deal breaker for me. Especially if he can't get in a spot where he could do it for a few seconds for a photo that means a lot to her. *I* need that type of intimacy.

Damn I think I might have to steal this idea for when I eventually get married, CHEERS Balzar.\n\nI do have a penchant for girls with big noses though and mine isn't exactly small so not sure it'll be as cute for me but oh well.", "If his reaction is this strong, he probably needs to talk it through with a professional.", "I think a tender kiss on the forehead would be lovely.", "To be entirely fair it doesn't sound like it was a serious suggestion", "Or not. Dude could also just not kiss people. Doesn't seem like that critical of an absence from his life.", "I think that could be BEAUTIFUL", "Oh I think it was.", "yeah but you're ignoring the fact that OP has went without kissing for this ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP to accomodate him and HIS NEEDS but he can't kiss her once for FIVE SECONDS at their WEDDING to accomodate her needs? like yes it's important he feels comfortable but it's also HER WEDDING and she asked for A PECK. NTA OP.", "Well, yeah. When you enter into a relationship with someone who hates kissing, it generally follows that the relationship doesn't involve kissing. Why would that suddenly change for the biggest moment of his life? Seems like a really weird time to encroach on his boundaries. If she wants a partner who's gonna be kissing her, she chose unwisely."]}
