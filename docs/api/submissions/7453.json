They make him uncomfortable. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a sensory thing or what, I didn\u2019t pry, I just accepted it and accommodated to make my partner happy. It was a bit strange at first but nothing I couldn\u2019t live without, and ever since we have never kissed around the general mouth area, but he\u2019s completely fine with cheek/forehead/etc kisses.\n\nNow: We\u2019ve (27M and 25 NB) been together for five years and he\u2019s proposed! We were recently talking wedding planning and I mentioned a thing that my mother did in her wedding scrapbook. Scrapbooking is a very important hobby to me and something that helped my mom and I connect before she passed, in her wedding scrapbook she has a picture of her and my dad\u2019s kiss at the alter and on the paper surrounding where the photo was placed, the bridesmaids had kissed the paper and signed their name beneath the marks using the same shade of lipstick they had worn at the wedding. Even a few of a groomsmen left their own kisses with borrowed lipstick (she laminated the page for sentimental and sanitary reasons). This is a thing I\u2019ve wanted to do for years, even before I got into scrapbooking, simply because my parents look back on that photo so fondly and it was super cool to see as a child.\n\nI mentioned to my fianc\u00e9 that I wanted to do this in my wedding scrapbook, and he went \u2018but won\u2019t that be kind of weird since we won\u2019t be kissing at our wedding?\u2019 I was absolutely dumbfounded and asked what he meant, and he went on to reiterate that I know he doesn\u2019t like mouth-kisses and he didn\u2019t want to do it on his wedding day. \n\nI asked, \u2018not even a peck? what are we supposed to do at the alter?\u2019\n\nHe literally replies, and I mean this is a DIRECT QUOTE: \u2018I dunno? Maybe a hug or high-five or something? We still have time to figure it out.\u2019 And left the room. \n\nI have brought it up twice since, and explained that not only is this important to me, but also it would be incredibly embarrassing for us as a wedded couple to just high-five and then walk down the isle afterwards. And it\u2019s not like i\u2019m asking him to make out with me, or do the stupid \u2018ring the bell and the couple kisses thing\u2019 I just want a standard kiss at the alter and hopefully a good photo of it.

Holy shit I'd be mortified to high five my wife at the altar. That's embarrassing", "Does he have issues with intimacy?", "Hmmmm\n\nNAH\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for wanting to be kissed but you said you accepted him never kissing you. \n\nHe is NTA for not wanting to kiss you as he told you in the beginning. \n\nInfo - how is the rest of your sex life?\n\nEdit - I ask this only because \u201cif you\u2019re waiting until you\u2019re married\u201d then you may be up for a very non sexual, non affectionate, non touching life. Forever.", "Nta but I\u2019d rethink this entire relationship. I married a man who wasn\u2019t affectionate at all except for right before sex and at first I thought I could live with it. After all he showed me he loved me through his other behavior. But it ended up being a very loveless marriage. I remember vividly one moment after our divorce when I asked someone in a pet store if I could pick up their puppy and I started crying when it buried itself in my neck and snuggled me. I hadn\u2019t been \u201cheld\u201d or loved on in years by that point and the affection I got from a stinking puppy broke me.", "NAH, Is his dislike of kissing so intense he can't accommodate for one moment at your wedding? I feel there has to be something deeper here if it's so horrible to him he can't even fathom doing it once... Edit: You need to know his reasoning because this is obviously bothering you, and he won't budge so it could be serious. This is probably info you'll need...", "NTA.  I couldn't live with this.  Think about it before you marry him.  No. Kiss. Ever.  No matter what.  It doesn't sound like he said that before.  He only said it made him uncomfortable.  Now he's clear.  If it isn't ok, it might be time to slow things down and re-think it.  I would need to know what is behind it.\n\nI thought N A H, but when I saw that he wouldn't talk about it, that tipped it.  I believe in boundaries.  All the same I would want a real conversation about it.", "NTA stop the wedding planning & get couples therapy now!", "I am not trying to be rude but this would be a deal breaker for me, I honestly don\u2019t know how you made it this far with person.  \n\nNAH but damn", "Probably NAH honestly?\n\nYou're not in the wrong for wanting to continue a tradition and get one quick peck on the mouth at your wedding for a photo. And you're not pushing for him to suddenly be okay with mouth kisses all the time, or anything. You've been very accepting of it, and that's great.\n\nSadly, it might be time to pry (gently, not demanding and all that) about what the aversion is. It could go much deeper than a sensory thing, in which case his reaction makes no sense. But without knowing that, him refusing to discuss it with you and shutting the conversation down puts him close to AH territory imo. We all do things we don't care for or even actively dislike now and again, so I don't see why one quick kiss for a once-in-a-lifetime event is so bad.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve agreed to go your entire life without mouth to mouth kisses. That is a significant sacrifice. You partner can deal with this one single kiss.", "NTA but you need to have a deeper conversation with your partner about this. Would this deeply affect the beginning of your marriage if you didn\u2019t get kissed and have that moment? \n\nWould you resent him for not conceding on this? \n\n(Also I really want to know why he doesn\u2019t like this. Does he have bad oral hygiene???)", "NTA. Based on what you wrote, I feel like you have sacrificed a lot for this relationship. I also think you will lose out in the end, and are honestly losing out right now (though you don\u2019t realize it yet). There are more likely much more compatible partners out there for you.", "NYA.    Drop the ah, find someone normal", "NTA but I am confused if there is no intimacy then why bother getting married and why not just be friends. Sorry this is strange to me", "NTA but please stop being dishonest with yourself. You want a relationship that involves mouth kissing and your current partner/fiance won't give you that. There is someone else who will. Break up and find that person.", "Just for clarity, are either of you asexual?", "NAH. You\u2019re not an asshole for wanting this, but he\u2019s not an asshole for having this (seemingly odd) boundary either. \n\nViolating his autonomy about it to fulfil your needs isn\u2019t the way to go. You guys need to perhaps work out a halfway point. \n\nI\u2019d also be asking what the deal is here, and suggesting perhaps this issue is explored in therapy \u2014 cos going your entire life without kissing your partner is going to be a bummer for you, and you need to work out now if you\u2019re compatible or not.", "YWBTA if you forced him to do this since you agreed to the no-kissing rule. If you truly are okay with a life without kissing your SO (a thing I can't imagine doing), then do a different photo, like him kissing your hand, which could be very romantic.\n\nBut more importantly, ARE you okay with this? And has he made any attempt to explain why he's asking you to give up a crucial part of intimacy? I feel as though the wedding photo is just forcing you to face this situation, and that perhaps a couples counsellor could help both of you drill into this and at least understand why before you commit your lives to each other.", "NTA - Don\u2019t marry a person who is *this* unable to read you/see your side of things.", "Info: have you considered couple's counseling. Because you should.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNAH but you need to sort this out completely before marriage.", "INFO: the act of kissing, even if it isn't slobbery making-out, is an act of intimacy. Do you not need that to engage in other acts of intimacy?", "NTA. He is not the man for you. Move on", "Is your husband neurodivergent?", "YTA for trying to marry a man who won\u2019t kiss you and not even ask why.\n\nYou aren\u2019t ready for marriage.", "Up high! Down low! Too slow!", "NTA. You have gone above and beyond to support your partner. You deserve the same. I wonder if he is able to put himself in your shoes. You are entitled to a kiss.", "YMTA.  If he's been years of feeling uncomfortable about this, my first question is why?  Is it a general preference, or is there a trauma trigger related to it.  If the second no question YTA.  \n\nI personally don't see why a cute cheek kiss wouldn't still suffice for the photo described as a compromise?  The ESH option is on the table because you've said he refuses to discuss it at all and find that compromise together.", "NAH\n\nI think it would be helpful for you to understand why he can\u2019t even do a peck at your wedding. \n\nIf he just can\u2019t, a photo of him kissing your check could be sweet? Still a \u201ckissing\u201d photo.", "YTA. He has been very up front since the beginning that he doesn't like kissing on the mouth. Why did you think it would be any different on your wedding day? It's *his* special day too, do you want him to be uncomfortable?\n\nand of course you're not gonna high five each other- you took his not great, off the cuff suggestion and ran with it. I'm sure there are really lovely alternatives you could do to kissing on the mouth, and I think you could still come up with a version of the page from your mom's scrapbook.", "YTA. He was upfront and honest with you about his feelings about mouth-kisses from the beginning of your relationship. \n\nYou chose to marrying him knowing that this was his preference, so why on would you expect that preference to not impact your wedding? \n\nHe\u2019s cool with forehead kisses, that could be a sweet alternative that would still look loving in pictures.", "YTA he told you from the start that\u2019s a boundary for him", "**YTA**\n\nI'll be honest, I was going to say N-A-H, but the more I read other judgements and the more I thought about it, the more I realised that YTA, and this is why:\n\n>I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a sensory thing or what, I didn\u2019t pry, I just accepted it and accommodated to make my partner happy. It was a bit strange at first but nothing I couldn\u2019t live without.\n\nExcept that apparently you can't live without it. Because you're changing the rules suddenly, all because \"it's your wedding\". But you never told him that was your expectation, that you could respect his boundaries . . . except on celebratory occasions?\n\nBut say it wasn't about that. Say it wasn't about your expressed embarrassment at the idea of him kissing you on the cheek or high-fiving or whatever at the altar. Or about crossing what is clearly a really uncomfortable physical boundary for him because \"wedding day\" (which, I get that it's a special day but it's still a really arbitrary reason to stomp on someone's physical \"this makes me uncomfortable\"). Say you really HAVE just realised suddenly that you're not sure you can live the rest of your life without being kissed on the mouth . . .\n\nYou'd still be TA because you've been in a relationship with this man for FIVE YEARS, love him enough to say yes to MARRYING him and spending the rest of your life with him . . . but didn't care to inquire into why something that is an expression of deep affection for most people makes him deeply uncomfortable. You say you \"didn't want to pry\" but that's one thing when you're dating a month; when you've been together for years it's not prying, it's learning to understand your partner's needs, vulnerabilities, the things that make them feel safe and unsafe and why. And you just . . . didn't do that? I don't get it. \n\nYou've accepted it all this time. You've given him reason to believe that you have no problem with it. Now you're changing the rules without ever even bothering to find out why he said \"please don't\" in the first place. YTA, and I'm not sure you're ready for a lifelong partnership.", "YTA. This was a boundary for him from the jump.", "Yta\n\nHe is right. He made his boundaries clear from the start and you accepted it. Why do you keep pushing him? Why are you so surprised? If he doesn't want to kiss you then that's it. He doesn't want to.\n\nCan't you compromise on the matter? You say he doesn't mind cheek or forehead kisses so why not settle for that?\n\nBut you would definitely be ta if you kept pressing the issue and be like it's my way or the highway. The wedding is for both of you, not just you.", "YTA: Since the beginning, it's been a known issue.  Now you can't respect it?", "He\u2019s not an AH for not wanting a kiss on the lips given that\u2019s a sensory thing HOWEVER he is for seemingly not letting there be a kiss on the cheek.", "YTA for knowing he had an aversion to kissing on the mouth, not having done so together for five years, then assuming he\u2019d be ready and willing to do it at your wedding in front of an audience.\n\nI think the scrapbook concept would work just as well with a photo of a forehead or cheek kiss. One of my fave wedding pics is of my husband kissing my hand (on which he\u2019d just placed my wedding ring).", "YTA. Your one special moment doesn't have to be entirely 'ruined', you could do a forehead kiss, cheek, anything, but if he's so against kissing on the mouth that you haven't done it your entire relationship, then why force him to do something that he can't stand at any point?\n\nThe bigger question here is, should you even marry him. You seem to think this is just some odd, he'll be fine eventually, type thing, and you aren't taking it seriously enough to even bother asking him why?  This is your life for the rest of your life. If this is something that is a hard and fast rule for him, seriously consider it for your future. It's not a him thing or a you thing, people are allowed to decide if they don't like a certain type of touch or action, but I don't think you're really looking at an entire lifetime of never kissing. \n\nIt's time to talk about this and anything else that you've set aside before talking wedding details", "Slight YTA... I don't blame you for wanting an 'iconic' photo. \n\nBut.\n\nThis is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with and whose wedding day you are sharing. If a kiss would make them so uncomfortable that it would materially change their impression of the day, I think you should respect that. \n\nA high-five photo actually sounds pretty fun and cool. \n\nHere's a spur-of-the-moment idea. Would your fiance object to 'kissing' a sheet of paper or some other material?  Maybe they would participate in the creation of a scrapbook memory that wouldn't stress them and you can still have a scrapbook memory. Or, if you high-five, put some handprints in there. \n\nSure, it would be cool to recreate this if your fiance was into it, but since they are not, make your own riff on it. It's a day for both of you and if mouth-kissing isn't part of your relationship, maybe it would be more meaningful to have something that your fiance could wholeheartedly contribute to.", "YTA, not for wanting to be kissed, but for expecting him to cross a boundary he has been up front about from the beginning. Why should he have to do something that makes him deeply uncomfortable so that you can immortalize it in a scrapbook? It is his special day too, and you need to respect that and his boundaries. If the no kissing suddenly is a deal breaker to you you need to think about what that means for your relationship BEFORE you marry him.", "ESH. Is he neurodivergent? I would want to know the why behind this before I tied the knot. Are you satisfied with the other aspects of your relationship ? Physical and emotional?", "YTA. Your entire relationship involved no kissing because he doesnt like it. You can continue the tradition your own way. Too many of these arguments happen because if the parents did it, it must be the right way. Your marriage is not your parents marriage. Do the tradition how your unique marriage is. And yes hi five is a dumb idea. Figure something else out!", "YTA\n\nThis is a well-known boundary of his. You're asking him to break it for a scrapbook photograph.", "YTA. You know he doesn\u2019t like it. You\u2019ve accepted it enough that you agreed to marry him. But you thought you would do it on the wedding day for some reason? If you guys never kiss why would you on your wedding day? It\u2019s his wedding too and he should be comfortable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I just want to throw out there that people who have been sexually abused, particularly very early on before they had words for what was happening, can have an aversion to specific physical acts or parts of their bodies being touched.  (There could also be something like a twist on a germ phobia going on here.)  If this man is able to have a normal sex life with the OP apart from his aversion to kissing, and the OP is comfortable with this being absent from his sex life and expressions of affection, who is anyone else to tell him this isn't acceptable in a marriage?\n\nThe scrapbook and the kiss at the alter (which could be finessed by turning away toward the alter) aren't very big deals in the context of a marriage to a man the OP has loved for years and wants to marry.\n\nIf, OTOH, the fiance's aversion to kissing is emblematic of something bigger and profoundly serious, such as withholding, in the relationship, OK, reconsider.  I'm wondering, though, does he see this as a problem or as trauma related?  Is it something he would want to explore in therapy (with the OP understanding that the purpose of therapy can't be for him to be able to kiss the OP on the mouth unless he sees this as his goal in seeking treatment; it might not be either his goal or attainable)?  Is the OP just upset at the prospect of being embarrassed at the alter, or is he actually upset about a lifetime commitment without kisses on the mouth?\n\nEdited to correct the gender; thank Mx-Logi for pointing this out.", "NTA...but...altho I think the high-five thing is cringe, I understand a long, tight hug as an option and maybe a kiss on the cheek.  It's very hard to understand people who aren't into certain types of physical affection but I'm one of them.  You can see by comments that people are trying to see it as unnatural, calling for therapy, etc and that's just a lack of understanding. I feel for you and your fiance both, I hope you do find a compromise.", "Not trying to pry, but are you sexually active? If you aren\u2019t having sex now, have you spoken about how intimate you will be after marriage? You need to know if he has any interest in sex. He may be non-sexual. If he has no interest in sex, you need to decide if you want that kind of relationship with your husband. Good luck!", "Soft YTA. I do understand that it's your wedding day and something you are looking forward to. However, if kissing like this is something you agreed to never do in your relationship, I don't understand why the wedding would be different.\n\nI know you have been looking forward to that photo. Like you said your parents look back fondly on it. But will that be a memory your husband looks back fondly on? Being pressured into a kiss he wasn't comfortable with for the sake of a photo op and keeping up appearances?\n\nThe fact that you talk about how embarrassing it will be not to kiss at the altar is what changes this from N A H to a soft Y T A for me. Your wedding should be the one day that is 100% about you and your partner as a couple, not having to bow to other people's expectations. If that's what you are worried about, I think you need to do some reflection before getting married. Are you ready to commit yourself for life to this man who has told you he will never consent to mouth kissing? Are you ready to support him 100%, including if family members were to ask about that part of your relationship? If your answer is anything other than yes, I don't know that you are ready for marriage.\n\nAnd if the answer is yes...the first step to supporting him is not pressuring him into a type of physical affection he is uncomfortable with on your wedding day. \n\nAnother comment had a great suggestion of doing forehead kisses instead. I think it would be beautiful for each of you to take a turn kissing each other's forehead. You would get two photos instead of one! And more importantly, those kisses would be genuine expressions of love, rather than something forced.", "YTA. So you already knew this about him and still want him to feel uncomfortable?", "Maybe forehead touch, with intertwined fingers. It's sweet, makes for a good photo and is intimate.", "YTA\n\nFor thinking he would change, or he didn\u2019t mean it, or wedding would be an exception. I guess it\u2019s perfectly normal to expect a kiss at the altar. However, you needed to listen closely to his boundary-setting statements, and take them to heart. I think you were in denial about his not wanting to kiss.\n\nKnowing about the family photo, why didn\u2019t you discuss this more thoroughly in the beginning? You\u2019re wanting to marry a man without fully knowing about a major issue. You are the red flag \ud83d\udea9 in this situation. \n\nDo you really think you can go through life never kissing your husband? Not for Valentines Day or your anniversary or NYE? \n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me. The instant a man tells me this, I\u2019m out. \n\nHard to believe this is a real story, honestly. But maybe he is a germaphobe or has abuse issues related to mouth kissing. Who knows.", "So do you just tell the officiant we don\u2019t want the \u201cyou may now kiss the bride/groom\u201d ?????

And maybe therapy?? \n\nBut if the kiss won't happen, what about an Eskimo kiss? That's when you rub the tips of your nose together. It's a little more intimate than...a high five...", "Why should his wedding be the place where he makes accommodations that make him uncomfortable? Like, sure, it could be that he's just pathologically unable to kiss, and the request is an impossibility, or it could be that he just really doesn't like it, but I can't really see why the latter is illegitimate. This is a big lifetime moment or whatever. Why should it make him feel like shit?", "This would be a deal breaker for me.

Imagine him with really tense body language, lips pressed firmly together and then rubbing his lips with the sleeve of his jacket followed by a sigh of relieve that it is over? And maybe you will hear about it all of your life that he accomindated you and how difficult it was.\n\nI think you should talk with him why kissing is something he hates and if there is anything you can do instead. It helps a lot to better understand your spouse and this should be more important than a kiss. I understand that you want to start a tradition, but you can always start a new one or make it your own.

I can understand that this is important for you, but that you priorise something you WANT above your partner not feeling uncomfortable is kind of wild to me.

Before the kiss happens he will think about nothing else than the moment he has to do something he doesn't want and feels really uncomfortable doing and even have to do it in front of a bunch of guests. Everything afterwards will be overshadowed by him knowing he was just forced to do this and feeling violated. \n\nI don't understand why you want your partner to not enjoy his wedding.

They could fake kiss going \"cheek to cheek\" while one of them holds up a bouquet to block their faces, like a cute \"you can't watch this\" sort of thing. One person could wear a veil and throw it over the other. They could burst into song and dance right when everyone expects a kiss and start an effin' flash mob.

You're mad that OP is kind of ignorant but... Nobody is born with all the knowledge specially for interpersonal relationships. \nIf the aversion is so great that it can not even bend for a kiss... That's really serious. It looks like smoke for a dangerous fire. And it's only noticed now.

Why do all you people suddenly forget consent has to be given enthusiastically, not under pressure or coercion, to be consent?", "Stop making excuses for shitty behavior", "Edit: After a reply, I realized the basis of the comment was about consent. I did not get that at first and yes, all options need consent, including kissing. If OP were to kiss their fiance at the alter without consent, that would not be okay and I agree with Fakenowinnit, SA.\n\nSex and kissing are very different things though. I don't think they can be compared, at least not on this scale you want to make it out to be. I am not talking about pressuring or coercing, but making compromises is natural for a relationship and healthy to. So is giving and taking, on a healthy level. That is clearly stated in my post. If it was sex, no matter the gender, then I'd disagree with OP, because sex is heavier and more intimate. The persons gender has nothing to do with this. If the person who wants sex needs it for their relationship, then they should break up and find someone more suitable. Simple as that. Same goes if you don't want anything touchline, whether it be hugs, kisses, etc., but your partner does and it doesn't align with you as you don't, you break up and find someone who's okay with that. Compromises are important, but everyone has needs, whether it's they need a partner who would love to hug or they need a partner who won't hug them all the time and is okay with that. A cuddlebug most likely can't work with someone who is the type of ace who doesn't want any touch. The cuddlebug would lack something that's important to them. Best is a break up. Same if it was the cuddlebug not respecting the aces boundaries, then best for the ace to break up and look for someone that's best suited for their needs. I'm pretty close to that type of asexuality/demisexual, so I won't look for a partner that needs constant specific type of affections.\n\nHowever, the example with kissing being sex now is not on the same level. They're not the same.\n\nIf OP truly needs the kiss and their partner keeps refusing, because they might truly have trauma or truly just hates it, then my suggestion would be revaluate the relationship and find people more suited for each other. I'm mostly ace and if someone got together with me, but they needed more sex, a break up would be the best, because their needs are just as important as mine are.", "Consent is consent. If someone kisses you against your will, that is sexual assault too. It is not rape, but it is sexual assault. The basis of comparison isn't \"sex and kissing are the same\" let alone \"someone kissing you against your will is the same as rape\", the basis of comparison is the enthusiastic consent that OP's fianc\u00e9 has not given and won't give her and the problem I have with how people discuss it isn't that I think OP can't wish the be kissed or that it's an outlandish demand, but that people are trying to tell OP it's okay to just push against her fianc\u00e9's boundaries and coerce him and that his boundaries are just not normal and thus not reasonable. You'd think we are far enough with fighting for both equal rights as well as acceptance of individuality - also with respects to expression of romantic and sexual feelings - that we don't go and push someone to try and coerce someone to do something they're not willing to do as a solution to a conflict of interests, let alone call that a compromise. I do agree with absolutely everything else you have said aside from that though. The solution probably involves honest conversation about why the fianc\u00e9 hates kissing, what they could do instead of kissing that expresses trust and intimacy as well but without making either of them uncomfortable, etc. And I truly don't understand why those conversations haven't already happened and why OP just assumed they would kiss at the altar as if it was a given when she's been aware her fianc\u00e9 hates kissing since the beginning of their relationship.", "Claiming it\u2019s the right thing to do \u201cbecause it\u2019s a tradition\u201d is nonsense. There\u2019s a lot of things claimed traditionally about weddings that can\u2019t be made to fit for every couple. Hell, a large portion of people would still claim that the \u201ctradition\u201d of marriage should only apply to a man and a woman, so a man and an enby shouldn\u2019t be getting married at all. This is supposed to be a special day for both of them, it should not be made slightly more special for one partner by trodding on the bodily autonomy and clearly set boundaries of the other", "If I don't want to have sex but my partner does, their wanting sex doesn't trump my not wanting sex, because not having sex doesn't actively cause them harm but having sex against my will is being sexually assaulted. It's the same concept.", "That I agree with and makes more sense. In the comment before, for me it came off rather comparing the actions as if they're the same intensity, but put that way, I definitely agree. I think it kinda became clear the way I understood it in the previous comment. I'll edit the previous comment bit accordingly. Thank you! \n\nI do agree with you and I think now it might be a NAH situation really for me, because we don't know how OP is trying to approach further talks and also the partner is within their rights to still decline. They really need to talk about why their fiance doesn't like it and figure out other ways so both can be happy at their wedding or if it's something both might not align with at all."]}
