I have never heard about her drinking or anything. Shes a good kid. Well last Saturday, she calls me at like 1 am. She sounds upset, and asks me to come get her. She sends me her location and I pick her up, from some highschool party.  Shes a little tipsy and shes been crying. I ask her if she wants to go to my house or to her house. She asks to come to my house. While driving, I ask her why she was crying, what happened? But she says \"nothing\". When we get home, I tell her \"Thank you for calling me, I'm glad to know you are safe\" and she starts sobbing. This time she tells me what happened. \"She was supposed to be at a sleep over that night, but her and her friends decided to go to a party. She never really drank before but decided to that night. Some boy at the party started to make her uncomfortable, and when she asked her friends to leave, they were clearly drunk and she didnt want to get in a car with them. So she called her dad, M. When she asked him to pick her up he told her \"no, you got yourself there, you can get yourself home.\" And yelled at her. After that she panicked a bit before calling me. I was pretty mad at her dad, but I just gave her water and put her to bed on my couch.\n\n when I woke up, I texted my sister, D, and let her know I had R. I dont have Rs dads phone number. I mads us breakfast.  I told her I was very proud of her for calling me, that it was a good decision, when good decision making is hard. I also tried to remind her, in a gentle way, that drinking opens you up to so many risks and dangers, telling her how I was roofied when I was at a party. She hung out on my couch for most of the rest of the day. When it started to get late, I asked if she was ready to go home. She asked if she could stay the night again, and I asked what her parent said? And a few minutes later she said they didn't care.\n\nWell around 11 am the next day, D calls me in a panic, asking if I had seen R. Turns out she didn't see my message, and M had just now told her about the call from R, as he had stated freaking out when she never made it home. It also turns out R didnt text them about staying at mine. \n\nWhen I dropped her off M flipped out on me saying I was encouraging R to drink, and that he thought she was hurt or dead. I told him he is very lucky she called me, because otherwise she might have been dead and it would be his fault. Later D said she was glad I picked R up, but that last bit was too far as M did have a daughter who died (cancer not anyones fault).

I have a 15yr old daughter and I have always told her AND all of her friends as well as my nieces and nephews that they can always call me. I will come, no questions asked.\nThis has always been a big thing for me because when I was in high school, there were over 16 kids that died in my 4 years there. All from drinking and driving. Kids I knew and kids my siblings knew. \nHell there was just an accident a few weeks ago that killed 4 juniors less than a week after they received their senior pictures. Seeing those pictures at their funerals was brutal. But the parents did it specifically to kind of show the kids that they were what should have been but never will be. \nI've had some of them call me just to talk about stuff they felt they couldn't talk to their mom or dad about. I listen, give my opinion and ALWAYS tell them they can go to one of their parents (depending on the kid....some of them have one parent who is fantastic and another that is a total A-hole.) I have only ever picked up two kids and once it was to get the kid away from her own abusive father. (She stayed with me until her mom got home from a work thing.) The other time was similar to this situation but the kid (A 16F) wasn't drinking. I went and got her around 2am and immediately called her dad (because up until then he was the \"chill\" parent I got along with and he had primary custody) however he then proceeded to scream at me for picking her up and this was a \"teaching moment that actions have consequences\" and that I needed to bring her home immediately. I didn't. I told him I wouldn't bring her home to a hostile environment when she was already feeling guilty for something that really wasn't in her control, especially since she called him at 9pm and asked him to come get her. I said he could come pick her up from my house the next morning once he had calmed down. When he got to my house the next morning, we had just found out that that party ended with 3 teenagers killed in a car accident. One of them being the girl that drove A to the party. \nI wish every child had at least ONE adult in their life, whether their own parent, family member or friends parent that they could trust in a situation like this. I know the girls family that was driving that night and I know they left her to fend for herself because they also believed in \"teachable moments.\" I pray their younger children never get themselves into one of those moments. \nYou did the right thing and hopefully the dad comes around to see that and thanks you.", "NTA for picking her up. I\u2019m very glad she had you to turn to because her dad sucks. \n\nBut you should have checked in with her parents to ensure that it was okay for her to stay. Yes, you should be able to trust a 15 year old about this. But given the situation, where mistakes had already been made, it was your responsibility as the adult to ensure that all adults knew where their child was and were okay with her being there.", "NTA but you should have called the parents to ask if she could stay.", "NTA.

Thank you.", "For some reason, people like the dad here think that such a policy encourages drinking, as if picking up a teen who's drunk means there wouldn't be a response if they went out drinking every night. It's really dumb. My grandma, who raised me, had the \"call me at any time and I'll pick you up\" policy and was even willing to let me try alcohol (when I was like 17 and about to go to college) in the safety of the house so I would know how I react. That's good parenting imo.", "My very first time drinking was with two friends who were sisters and lived down my street. I got picked up by my dad at the local pizza place, had to sit through the dinner from hell, got grounded and went to bed early. At the bus stop the next day I find out that those two walked home to find themselves locked out and had to sleep under the porch, pee in the woods and go straight to school the next day. I was furious they didn\u2019t come over but they expected I got similar treatment. We were 13.", "There might be a reason why she doesn't want to go home, besides getting in trouble. I'd definitely check in with the kiddo afterwards to make sure she's ok. A parent doing what her dad did is already abusive as fuck. I'm worried what else he is or isn't doing.", "This is so important - and as OP did, to extend it to the friends of the teens.  My BFFs son was at a party and passed out from drinking shots.  Some of the kids at the party put him outside on a patio so there wouldn't be a mess inside in case he vomited.  A girl, not part of his direct friend group, but who had heard that his mom was \"cool\", took his phone and called my friend and told her that the son was in trouble.  My friend went to the party, got some kids to help her get him in the car and went to the ER where he was treated for alcohol poisoning.  Who knows was would have happened to him left out there for hours?", "Her mum locked her out of the house on July 14th and didn't even bother to wonder where she was til her friend phoned and asked if she was ok as she hadn't turned up to their friends' funerals on 15th, and then on the 18th they phoned the police and filed paperwork \"to have her sought and arrested as a runaway\". By the 18th, she'd been dead, dismembered, and covered in concrete for 2 or 3 days."]}
