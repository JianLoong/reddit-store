I have never heard about her drinking or anything. Shes a good kid. Well last Saturday, she calls me at like 1 am. She sounds upset, and asks me to come get her. She sends me her location and I pick her up, from some highschool party.  Shes a little tipsy and shes been crying. I ask her if she wants to go to my house or to her house. She asks to come to my house. While driving, I ask her why she was crying, what happened? But she says \"nothing\". When we get home, I tell her \"Thank you for calling me, I'm glad to know you are safe\" and she starts sobbing. This time she tells me what happened. \"She was supposed to be at a sleep over that night, but her and her friends decided to go to a party. She never really drank before but decided to that night. Some boy at the party started to make her uncomfortable, and when she asked her friends to leave, they were clearly drunk and she didnt want to get in a car with them. So she called her dad, M. When she asked him to pick her up he told her \"no, you got yourself there, you can get yourself home.\" And yelled at her. After that she panicked a bit before calling me. I was pretty mad at her dad, but I just gave her water and put her to bed on my couch.\n\n when I woke up, I texted my sister, D, and let her know I had R. I dont have Rs dads phone number. I mads us breakfast.  I told her I was very proud of her for calling me, that it was a good decision, when good decision making is hard. I also tried to remind her, in a gentle way, that drinking opens you up to so many risks and dangers, telling her how I was roofied when I was at a party. She hung out on my couch for most of the rest of the day. When it started to get late, I asked if she was ready to go home. She asked if she could stay the night again, and I asked what her parent said? And a few minutes later she said they didn't care.\n\nWell around 11 am the next day, D calls me in a panic, asking if I had seen R. Turns out she didn't see my message, and M had just now told her about the call from R, as he had stated freaking out when she never made it home. It also turns out R didnt text them about staying at mine. \n\nWhen I dropped her off M flipped out on me saying I was encouraging R to drink, and that he thought she was hurt or dead. I told him he is very lucky she called me, because otherwise she might have been dead and it would be his fault. Later D said she was glad I picked R up, but that last bit was too far as M did have a daughter who died (cancer not anyones fault).

Hopefully her Father has learnt something here as well about going to rescue his daughter from dangerous situations! I doubt it but hope he has!", "You were exactly right. M is a disgrace of a father, and if anything had happened to R that night it would have been his fault, for knowingly leaving his daughter in a dangerous situation after she called him for help.   \nIf my father had ever pulled what M did, my mother would have served him divorce papers within a week.  \nNTA", "NTA.

It sounds like there's quite a bit of dysfunctionality going on here, but it's good that your niece knows that you will help her if she needs it.

You texted her, sure. But you definitely should have tried calling her. To let her know that her daughter is safe. Not just a simple text. You also should\u2019ve told your niece to let her dad and mum know where she was at. \n\nOverall: you\u2019re a good person.

What do you think her family should have done, lock her in a closet for the rest of her life and feed her through a slot in the door? Put her in a straightjacket and only let her leave the house on a leash and with a chaperone? She was an adult; her family couldn't maintain her sobriety for her. \n\nBut even if you completely disregard all of that, her parents were at home in DC when she died in Madison, WI; not only could they literally not have caused her death by locking her out of the house, they had also just sent her another check (to replace the one she'd lost the week before, while drunk) to cover the security deposit on a new apartment. When her body was found, she had the key to her new apartment in her pocket. \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/teresa-mcgovern-a-death-in-the-cold/2012/10/21/42ad26ca-1bde-11e2-ba31-3083ca97c314_story.html"]}
