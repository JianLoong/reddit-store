I have never heard about her drinking or anything. Shes a good kid. Well last Saturday, she calls me at like 1 am. She sounds upset, and asks me to come get her. She sends me her location and I pick her up, from some highschool party.  Shes a little tipsy and shes been crying. I ask her if she wants to go to my house or to her house. She asks to come to my house. While driving, I ask her why she was crying, what happened? But she says \"nothing\". When we get home, I tell her \"Thank you for calling me, I'm glad to know you are safe\" and she starts sobbing. This time she tells me what happened. \"She was supposed to be at a sleep over that night, but her and her friends decided to go to a party. She never really drank before but decided to that night. Some boy at the party started to make her uncomfortable, and when she asked her friends to leave, they were clearly drunk and she didnt want to get in a car with them. So she called her dad, M. When she asked him to pick her up he told her \"no, you got yourself there, you can get yourself home.\" And yelled at her. After that she panicked a bit before calling me. I was pretty mad at her dad, but I just gave her water and put her to bed on my couch.\n\n when I woke up, I texted my sister, D, and let her know I had R. I dont have Rs dads phone number. I mads us breakfast.  I told her I was very proud of her for calling me, that it was a good decision, when good decision making is hard. I also tried to remind her, in a gentle way, that drinking opens you up to so many risks and dangers, telling her how I was roofied when I was at a party. She hung out on my couch for most of the rest of the day. When it started to get late, I asked if she was ready to go home. She asked if she could stay the night again, and I asked what her parent said? And a few minutes later she said they didn't care.\n\nWell around 11 am the next day, D calls me in a panic, asking if I had seen R. Turns out she didn't see my message, and M had just now told her about the call from R, as he had stated freaking out when she never made it home. It also turns out R didnt text them about staying at mine. \n\nWhen I dropped her off M flipped out on me saying I was encouraging R to drink, and that he thought she was hurt or dead. I told him he is very lucky she called me, because otherwise she might have been dead and it would be his fault. Later D said she was glad I picked R up, but that last bit was too far as M did have a daughter who died (cancer not anyones fault).

I have a 15yr old daughter and I have always told her AND all of her friends as well as my nieces and nephews that they can always call me. I will come, no questions asked.\nThis has always been a big thing for me because when I was in high school, there were over 16 kids that died in my 4 years there. All from drinking and driving. Kids I knew and kids my siblings knew. \nHell there was just an accident a few weeks ago that killed 4 juniors less than a week after they received their senior pictures. Seeing those pictures at their funerals was brutal. But the parents did it specifically to kind of show the kids that they were what should have been but never will be. \nI've had some of them call me just to talk about stuff they felt they couldn't talk to their mom or dad about. I listen, give my opinion and ALWAYS tell them they can go to one of their parents (depending on the kid....some of them have one parent who is fantastic and another that is a total A-hole.) I have only ever picked up two kids and once it was to get the kid away from her own abusive father. (She stayed with me until her mom got home from a work thing.) The other time was similar to this situation but the kid (A 16F) wasn't drinking. I went and got her around 2am and immediately called her dad (because up until then he was the \"chill\" parent I got along with and he had primary custody) however he then proceeded to scream at me for picking her up and this was a \"teaching moment that actions have consequences\" and that I needed to bring her home immediately. I didn't. I told him I wouldn't bring her home to a hostile environment when she was already feeling guilty for something that really wasn't in her control, especially since she called him at 9pm and asked him to come get her. I said he could come pick her up from my house the next morning once he had calmed down. When he got to my house the next morning, we had just found out that that party ended with 3 teenagers killed in a car accident. One of them being the girl that drove A to the party. \nI wish every child had at least ONE adult in their life, whether their own parent, family member or friends parent that they could trust in a situation like this. I know the girls family that was driving that night and I know they left her to fend for herself because they also believed in \"teachable moments.\" I pray their younger children never get themselves into one of those moments. \nYou did the right thing and hopefully the dad comes around to see that and thanks you.", "NTA for picking her up. I\u2019m very glad she had you to turn to because her dad sucks. \n\nBut you should have checked in with her parents to ensure that it was okay for her to stay. Yes, you should be able to trust a 15 year old about this.

Good job for taking care of your niece though.", "Yta for not calling and speaking to the parents. So irresponsible.", "NTA absolutely NOT.  My kids have the same arrangement with me AND their aunt.", "NTA", "NTA. You were right. Horrible things can happen to 15 year old girls who are drunk at night. He chose to leave her in that situation and anything that happened would have been as a result of his choice. Your niece is lucky to have you there for her.", "NTA & never stop being the safe person to your niece. Every teenager needs a safe place to land after teenage mistakes. Hell, most of us could have used a safe place to land in our early 20's.", "Wow. NTA. It took them two days to notice she didn't make it home after the call? I would have gotten antsy after two hours.", "Well done.  Always be the one they'll call.  NTA.  M is the A and put his kid in danger.  There is a time for lesson-learning, and that was NOT it.  What an a\\*\\*.", "NTA - As a teen I had no one like you in my life so I did do the stupid thing and get in the car with a driver who was drinking. Looking back I thank my lucky stars that nothing bad happened.", "NTA M needs a kick in the sensible parts for what he did. He should have gotten her and grounded after . He's a total failure as a father and I'm pretty sure CPS would take an interest in how he's handling his daughter.\n\nAnd her mother is an enabler and as such an ah ALSO.\n\nThanks for being there for your niece", "NTA - hell no", "Wtf did her parents want her to do? NTA", "NTA and thank God for your actions and non-judgmental attitude. You definitely saved a life.", "NTA - good job.", "NTA in the slightest. It took over a day for dad to start getting worried? How is he in any position to be upset with you?", "Thank you so much for doing what you did. NTA and I'm glad that the world has aunts and uncles like you in it, we really need you", "NTA.  If she had no called you she would have been in real danger.  Her Dad seriously lacked any concern for her well being until two days later?  Insane.", "NTA.", "NTA. You should sue for custody.", "NTA!! You\u2019re a better parent to your niece than her own are. Thank you for getting her out of a potentially dangerous situation and back to safety!", "Obviously NTA for all the reasons already stated, BUT M\u2019s reaction is so AH that it makes me wonder if something else is going on, like if R left out some details that may make her case less sympathetic than it actually is, for example, or maybe some marital drama between M and R that you may not be aware of. \n\nOf course, nothing justifies leaving a 15 yo so dangerously in the dust like that, even if it was \u201ctheir fault\u201d. It\u2019s just something to keep in mind for the future, in case you find yourself being \u201cstuck in the middle\u201d, being scapegoated (by anyone), etc.", "NTA\n\nHer dad is an idiot. Anything could have happened to her. He should be grateful.", "NTA *at all*. M was going to let his child get raped or murdered, and he deserved to be told as much. You didn't go too far. You told him exactly what he did.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing your part as the aunt/uncle.", "[removed]", "You responded perfectly.  The dad was a complete A for his response when his daughter called him.  She was clearly in a dangerous situation and he didn't rescue her.  He left her there to be driven home by a drunk kid or even to be raped.  What horrible, horrible parenting.\n\nPlease let your niece know that you remain available to help her if she ever needs it, and that you're so proud of her for reaching out to you.\n\nNTA.  You're a hero.  You saved a kid.", "NTA. You did good. The kid\u2019s dad is a big one though. I\u2019m a father and I can\u2019t imagine leaving my daughter in that kind of situation and being so horrible and callous about it. I\u2019m glad you were there to pick R up. She\u2019s lucky to have a good adult like you looking out for her.", "NTA\n\nYou did exactly the right thing by picking your niece up.  You were there when she needed someone unlike her father.\n\nDo D and M live together because it's hard to tell whether they do?  If they do, they don't communicate very well.\n\nIt seems interesting that your sister didn't check her phone all day for texts to not have seen yours about having R at your place.  \n\nIt sounds like there is more going on with R and her parents if she didn't communicate with them that she's at your place.  Perhaps having a chat to her about what is going on there might be in order.  There seems to be some animosity between her and her dad but I'd want to know if your sister is ignoring what's happening.", "NTA. I hate parents like that who would rather keep their kid in a dangerous situation as a punishment to try to teach them a lesson. All that teaches them is to lie, and that their parent isn\u2019t a safe person to come to. I\u2019m glad your niece has you.", "NTA\n\nIt was a reality check for the dad. When your child calls for help, telling them to figure it out is a terrible response.", "NTA I hope you told your sister what M said because what you said was not wrong something bad could\u2019ve happened to R and it would\u2019ve been M\u2019s fault. His daughter that died has nothing to do with R and the situation HE put her in since he couldn\u2019t be bothered to pick her up. He should be happy she called him instead he decided to be a prick. Also I would\u2019ve made M really aware how were you supposed to let HIM know when you don\u2019t have his number.", "If this was the UK, this is the typical age to start drinking.", "NTA\n\nM felt the consequences of his hard-line parenting in not knowing where his child was and if she was safe. You weren't wrong even if you were a bit harsh.\n\nEveryone should have a trusted, nonjudgmental safe space so they still have a chance to make a good decision after a bad one. You did well.", "A boy was making her \"uncomfortable\" too! Plenty of women know what that word might actually mean in that kind of scenario. Too many stories of sexual assault start like this. \n\nI'm going to share an article since letter # 323 feels especially relevant.

It\u2019s not until 11am the day *after* anyone called OP. \n\nThat\u2019s an epic fail. 34 hours his daughter was missing and this dad had no idea if she was safe.", "My parent was like this, there was no limitations on a call for a ride home. Any time, any distance & any friends to their own house.

She was already in a bad situation let alone trying to get home by herself. It's like Brock turner never happened to some people let alone if she fell victim to someone like Paul bernardo. A shocking lack of concern for the daughter by the father and mother. I'm disgusted honestly", "He texted his sister.", "Niece was safe and it was the most important thing. OP texted their sister to let her know that niece is with them.   \nParents weren't so interested in their daughter safety, when they started to look after her after 34 hours.   \nIf I was worried about my daughter, I would call her and text her milion times, asking, where is she.
