I've looked up to him and he showed me some basics in my field\u00a0 of interest.\n\nDuring my last school year, he opened his own company and I asked him if he can take me in. He agreed, but warned me that money's not much for the moment. (In this field, you can get paid really good even as a beginner where we're from). I told him I'm happy to work with him for free as long as he's ok with me still learning. We agreed and he asked me to give him a call after the graduation exams and college admissions.\n\nI did. And he said he's gonna reach back to me the next week. He didn't. And I called him back and he said literally the same thing. I started college eventually (as the whole summer finished and nothing from him) and we met and he promised to call me next week, said he had an issue, etc.\n\nHe didn't. By now I gave up hope that he'd actually call me to work with him and was focusing on college. I've joined an organization where they taught me a lot of things in this field of interest. (Again, thing which I intend to make my profession). No sign from Dennis except a text on my birthday. I didn't even ask about our deal.\n\nLast week, surprise surprise, Dennis called me to ask me to work for him and that we can start. What he maybe wasn't aware of was the fact that I wasn't a total beginner just like when I asked him. Now I already know the main parts of what he could teach me and could work for money. And fairly good money. I asked about the offer he had for me and he reminded me of the fact that I agreed to work for free in exchange of his coaching.\n\nI told him that was almost a year ago and since then, considering the fact that he left me hanging, I took up work on my own. I explained that I have quite a busy schedule and have already been offered some places to work for money. I told him that if he wants me to consider him, he could also make me a salary offer.\n\nThat's where things went south. He got mad, saying I'm not honoring the deal, that we were friends, I'm leaving him hanging when he needs me, etc. I told him he did exactly the same to me. I explained he had the chance to have me at 0 experience for free and that now the quality of my services has improved, therefore, I expect to be paid. He told me that I couldn't have possibly gotten that good in a year and that probably he could find someone better to pay to do what he hand in mind for me. I wished him good luck and left as that.

You don\u2019t need the training from him anymore and he seems mad because you can\u2019t work for him for free. \nYou\u2019re better off just moving on from the situation because you seem to be doing good things with your life without him.", "NTA. This contract lacks consideration (he isn\u2019t putting up anything). It also lacks reliance (he has not relied on your promise). Lastly, it was not actioned within a reasonable timeframe. A year is too long and you are well within your rights to renegotiate. Both parties should be able to walk away here no harm done.", "NTA. He never took you up on your offer at the time and circumstances have changed.", "Absolutely NTA. Did he expect you to work for free whenever and for as long as he likes?", "NTA, there was no more deal because you did stipulate a time period. Sounds like he needs free labor all of a sudden, which isn't exactly an acceptable situation for your skill level. He ignored you when you needed him, instead of being straight with you. And because he's apparently willing to confront you with a lot if entitlement, he wasn't afraid to let you down easy, he just didn't think you were a social connection worth any acknowledgement. You did absolutely the right thing, you went after what you wanted, put in the work and he doesn't value that. He did you a favor by dropping you and then ending the friendship, you handling things really well and shouldn't hold any guilt over any if it.", "NTA\n\nYou dodged a bullet, sounds like.\n\nYou have more skills and abilities than you did. Your life has moved on. He should've kept in communication with you if he wanted you to actually work for him instead of taking you for granted. \n\nAnd it's not right to agree to let someone work for free anyways. People deserve to be paid for their skill and labor. If he can't afford to pay his employees, he can't afford to be in business.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need the coaching anymore, so it\u2019s fair you ask for some sort of compensation", "Why would you be an asshole for not working for free?  Why are you even asking?", "NTA. There's no reason to work for free at this point", "NTA. Bravo for recognizing your worth. You have an excellent business sense.", "NTA. You offered, he didn't take you up on your offer. Case closed. It's like in the service industry, every offer has an expiration date. Change of conditions and availability.", "NTA\n\nThat seemed almost like an apprenticeship of sorts. You were learning. Getting your foot in the door. Now that you\u2019re looking for a JOB, which is what he offered, you should be compensated. Definitely don\u2019t work for him, he sounds like an ass.", "NTA.\nHe left you hanging for a year with no actual updates. Congrats on the job offers", "The situation changed, you are no longer a novice who needs to work for free, and he was flaky. He angry response and his, flakyness, and unwillingness to pay you are all red flags. I'd stay away from this guy. NTA", "NTA\n\nBeside the fact that he didn't act on whatever you informally agreed for, like, a year, his end of the deal is void. You no longer need what he was offering. So he needs to offer something you do find useful in exchange for your services, which would be money.", "NTA.  For the record, you never agreed to work for free.  You asked for exposure and the opportunity learn and practice, and in exchange whatever benefit he got out of it he wouldn't need to compensate monetarily.  You've since gotten that exposure and practice, and you beyond the point of wanting a mentor and ready to be compensated for your production.  He sat on his hands and lost.\n\nYou don't have a deal.  Even from a legal standpoint, verbal contracts (which through Dennis' lack of action, you don't have) are only valid for under a year, which you're coming up upon.", "NTA You don\u2019t want to work for him, you have other opportunities now. He had his chance. And ya know he doesn\u2019t wanna pay you.", "NTA. I tell up and comings to always value their experience. If you've improved, your prices should reflect that. Yes you had a deal but he failed to honor his end of it so the deal was off. You've improved since then so you should be paid accordingly.", "NTA   You offered to work for free, he didn't take you up on it at the time. He can't expect you to work for free later when it is convenient for him. Needs change in a year, his obviously did. Holding you to an offer made a year ago is asking too much. We all need money.", "NTA, his non-responsiveness over the year nullified that deal IMO.  You've learned a lot in the meantime and he can pay you if he wants you to work for him.  Some friend!!  I'll bet he wouldn't take it well if the tables were turned and he was treated this way.  You're better off working elsewhere if that is an option.", "NTA. Dude does not care about you and had no intentions to do anything out of a sense of obligation towards you. He\u2019s frustrated he can\u2019t take advantage of you and is projecting his own shittiness", "NTA - You know your value. You pursued training when he did not respond to you. He presents as someone you wants to use others for his benefit on his timeline and terms. Continue to learn, make $ and thrive.", "NTA. Dennis should have appreciated that your suggested quid pro quo of free labour for coaching and experience was not open ended. It was his failure to get back to you for so long that gave you the opportunity to get paid employment, and experience, which makes your labour more valuable to him now than it would have been when the agreement was discussed.", "NTA. \"Sorry I'm no longer available\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
