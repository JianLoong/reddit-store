I'll be honest I don't like her. She cares too much about appearences and always has this stupid fake smile all the time. She always says I don't take care of myself enough, and gets upset that I don't get dressed as soon as I'm out of bed. Two things I absolutely will nevee wear are makeup and heels. I just don't like the way makeup makes me look, and heels just hurt so I don't bother.\n\nThe issue is they're making me be a bridesmaid (I didn't have a choice) and they're doing the matching dress thing. I actually like the dress they got for me, the problem is they got matching shoes too, and they're heels. \n\nShe's also getting annoyed at me for not wanting to wear makeup there either. She thinks I'll look out of place. I told them I'm willing to wear shoes that match, just not heels, and I'm not wearing makeup. My dad told me I should just suck it up for their day, but I told them I'm either going with no heels or makeup, or not at all deal with it. They've been pissy since, and some of my friends think I should just do it for them.\n\nEdit: So I decided to have one more talk with my dad about it. I told him it felt like they cared more about how I look at the wedding than me being happy, and like they didn't care I'd be uncomfortable and in pain. I also explained I haven't worn heels since I was 12, and never more than 10 minutes so I probably can't walk in them. I told him it wasn't fair that he isn't wearing makeup and I have to. \n\nSo I told him this. Either they let me wear flats amd no makeup, as a bridesmaid or not, or I'm not coming. They can punish me for that, not pay my college, kick me out whatever. He looked really upset, and called in his fiance to talk about it. I told her the same, and they talked for a while. They said they'd let me do what I want, and also would let me not be a bridesmaid if I want. They figured there was no reason to make everyone upset at eachother for no gain, and even though his fiance said she thinks I'm being silly, and even offered to teach me to walk in heels (I said hell no lol) agreed. I'm still gonna be a bridesmaid as a compromise, and I never really minded that much anyway, so hopefully it'll be alright.", "created_utc": 1679605570, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zxeoy/aita_for_telling_my_dad_and_his_fiance_im_not/", "score": 4651, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hate this assumption that makeup is the only way for women to look professional or appropriate or whatever. I always got in trouble with my high school choir teacher about this\u2014she wanted us in stage makeup for all performances. And yeah, heels are painful. I\u2019m not really into people forcing appearance related stuff. If you were begging to be a bridesmaid, then yeah you\u2019d need to play by their rules. But I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say \u201cdo this thing and look how I want you to.\u201d\n\nEdit: so glad to see your edit, and well done sticking up for yourself! I hope you feel great at the wedding, whatever you decide to wear.", "NTA\nThis sounds like an important issue to you, and they\u2019re well aware of it. They knew better. \n\nA third option, offer to attend, without makeup and heels, and not as a bridesmaid.", "NTA - being a bridesmaid isn\u2019t something that\u2019s forced upon someone - it\u2019s an invitation. You accept or decline. \n\nIf their requests are non negotiable for you, and their not willing to compromise with you, then you should decline the invitation to be a bridesmaid and if that\u2019s a deal breaker for them, then arrange to not be there on the day. \n\nI do, from the brides perspective understand wanting to have her bridesmaids looking how she intended - it\u2019s their big day yadda yadda, but it\u2019s your choice to be a part of that or not!", "NTA.  They shouldn't be forcing you to be a bridesmaid and demanding you wear makeup and heels.  It's your choice whether to wear heels or makeup, not theirs.  \n\nGlad to see you are standing up for yourself.", "NTA, they really shouldn't make you be a bridesmaids at all to be honest. And it's awful your dad is marrying someone his kids hates, you should be his priority not her.", "NTA - You shouldn\u2019t be forced to be a bridesmaid if you don\u2019t want to be. Makeup and heels are not your style and that\u2019s ok. If it was so important to them that you participate then it should be more inclusive as to who you are and not forcing things on you. It\u2019ll just continue to build up resentment the harder they try to force you.", "NTA\n\nYou should never have been forced to be a bridesmaid in the first place. Are they doing this as a show that you have given consent for this marriage to take place?\n\nIt's easy enough to find shoes that will match that are not heels. Imagine if she had a friend who was very tall and would look out of place in the photographs. \n\nHowever, with the makeup, if she thinks you will look out of  place then you can suggest that you relinquish your place as bridesmaid. I can imagine she would get a makeup artist to plaster crap on until you looked completely unrecognizable.", "NTA if theyre forcing you into the bridesmaid role plus expecting you to adhere to their dress code.", "NTA. Bodily autonomy is still a thing even if someone is having a wedding. \n\nAlso, if they are such sticklers about this, they could just have you not go. But they wanna pressure you to go, AND be a bridesmaid, AND wear makeup + heels, all without any compromise or empathy for how you feel. I hope your dad realizes that in the larger picture, his relationship with his daughter is far more important than just a single day.", "NTA. I wish you could get your dad a pair of heels and ask him to stand in them for several hours and then see how he feels about it. If a person hasn't trained themselves to wear heels over time it is excruciating. I (enby) tried to walk in heels for about 5 minutes once, and I thought I was going to die if I didn't get them off. \n\nMaybe ask the fianc\u00e9 if she'd rather you wear flats or have one bridesmaid who looks like she's in severe pain in all the photos, because there's no way you can just \"suck it up\" and pretend they don't hurt like hell. \n\nI'm also on your side with the makeup, but at least it doesn't hurt. If they insist on the makeup you could just pretend you're a drag queen for a day and be very campy and have fun with it.", "NTA. If you have matching shoes, you won't look out of place even if they're not heels. Not wearing makeup also shouldn't make you look like you don't belong there or anything. I don't think you're asking for anything unreasonable.", "NTA - you offered to attend as a guest and not be a bridesmaid or be a bridesmaid and wear matching flats.  These are both reasonable options, and if your dad and SMTB don\u2019t want to compromise that is on them.\n\nNow, I (who have a very petty soul) would be bringing make up wipes with me in case SMTB tries something at the pre-wedding and plan to go barefoot during the ceremony with sneakers as a backup.", "NTA. Your willingness to wear the dress and matching flats is something they should embrace.", "NTA and frankly I'm surprised they want a 16 year old to wear heels. In every wedding I've been to where someone's kid sister or something under 18 was in the wedding party they deliberately don't doll her up like an adult.", "I don't understand why they're making you do all this if you're not comfortable with it. One thing is to ask a favor of you, another is not giving you any choice.\n\nStand your ground OP.\n\nNTA.", "NTA for not wanting to wear heals or makeup.  No one has the right to force anything on to your body that sticks with their ideal image.  The fact that you are being forced to be a bridesmaid to a woman you don't even like is a serious AH move on your dad.  I'd consider you just being willing to do that enough of a compromise in this situation.", "NTA - remind them that no is a complete sentence and you\u2019re not a fucking prop. and that if she\u2019s so worried about you looking out of place without make up on, you\u2019ll gladly attend as a guest, which is what you wanted in the first place if they had bothered to ask or listen to you.", "NTA. It\u2019s your body, you decide what you wear and this woman does not get to force you to play dress up. You\u2019re a human being not a doll.", "It would be a shame if one of your heels accidentally broke off the day of the wedding. It happens sometimes if you step into a crack.\n\nIt\u2019s also common for people that aren\u2019t used to wearing heels to \u2018sprain their ankle\u2019 unexpectedly a few days before the ceremony while practicing walking in them. I have a feeling the bride would object to the optics of her bridesmaid limping awkwardly down the aisle in pain. \n\nSeriously tho, NTA. Standing for an entire wedding ceremony is tedious in comfortable shoes. It\u2019s downright cruel to force a young person to do it in heels.", "NTA.  Heels hurt if you aren't used to them, and I'm really good at turning ankles in mine.", "NTA. They're forcing you to go because they care more about portraying the perfect family unit and how well they've done to create it than they care about your boundaries. \n\nYou were willing to go for a perfecty reasonable compromise, but can't have that because fiancee isn't getting everything she wants.\n\nYour boundaries are inconvenient to them so they'll ignore them and manipulate you to try and get what they want. \n\nYou've just learned that not dealing with her tantrums is more important to your father than your comfort and your boundaries.", "NTA. Just because you'd identify as a woman, you can't be obligated to wear make-up. I assume they don't require make-up from the best man either.", "NTA. It\u2019s your body and you have the right to choose what you will or will not do with it, including what goes on it. Stand your ground and don\u2019t let anyone bully you into compliance. \n\nAlso, your dad sucks for siding with his fianc\u00e9e over his own daughter. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA, you shouldn't be forced to be uncomfortable and also if you didn't agree to be in the ceremony, don't let them put you in that position. I hated being in my mother and step father's ceremony. I don't like being in the center of attention and being in that spotlight had people thinking I was happy that my mother married that man. I was not happy with the union, couldn't be happier to be away now. Family are the people you CHOOSE not the people you are FORCED to call family.", "NTA - If they really wanted you there they\u2019d take you as you are.", "NTA. Take me as I am. Or remove me from the bridal party.", "NTA. If you were insisting on being a bridesmaid but also wanting them to acommodate you, that would be your fault. But they're forcing you to do something you don't want to do and be in a position you don't want to be. \n\nMy parents are divorced and he remarried around when I was your age. He invited me to the wedding and I declined the invitation. On hindsight I think I should've went, but I value how he gave me the option. I can only imagine how bad I would've felt if I had no option and also had to be groomsman.", "Do it if they get you a dog", "NTA - they're forcing you to take part in the first place, it's not like you asked to be part of the wedding party.\n\nPlus I'm not a fan of brides or grooms who force their wedding party to be uncomfortable on the grounds that it's just for one day. It's an unreasonable thing to ask people to do at all if there's no need to do it, and a wedding is not a need, it's a want, and really only for the people getting married! You can have a nice wedding, and also make it pleasant for other people to be there, it's not that hard.", "NTA. \n\nYour body, your choice. Period.", "If you had volunteered to be a bridesmaid, I would say Y T A. But since you were volunTOLD, NTA.\n\nI'm not sure how you resolve this if they won't let you step down. Is there something else you could suggest you do? Like a reading at the ceremony, where if you don't match it won't be a big deal?", "NTA.\n\nThey shouldn't expect you to have to change who you are for their photo op.  I don't like that people present themselves far beyond their normal, reasonable appearance for events like weddings.  You won't even recognize them in their pictures 'cuz where are their glasses, they never wear their hair that way, they have on different make-up, they never wear short hair, etc.  Okay, wearing appropriate attire is one thing but drastically changing one's appearance is another.", "INFO does your father usually listen to you? Have you tried having a private heart to heart with him about this?", "NTA you already accepted the dress and that is the main thing. I have been a bridesmaid in many weddings and while we don\u2019t get a choice in the dress (which is fine), we always got to choose our shoes. Some people wear thin heals, some chunky, some flats. The last thing you want is someone to fall on their face walking. \n\nThe make-up also NTA. I am super against make up but maybe look into just a light base and concealer so you don\u2019t look \u201cshinny\u201d in photos. I have a video on my phone to show people how to do my makeup from my sister because she knows how to do it without it looking like I have make-up on. Tell them you\u2019ll do makeup but only very, VERY light by a professional that they have to pay to have done.", "If she's not going to demand the men wear make-up and high heels then NTA. Don't let her bully you into doing this. You shouldn't have to conform to patriarchal standards to partake in YOUR FATHER'S wedding. This is ridiculous. She should be ashamed of herself.", "NTA. I mean I don\u2019t like my shoulders so my sister had cap sleeves put on my bridesmaids dress. This push back is all about her and nothing about you.", "Is this really about makeup and heels? Or is it about your dad marrying someone you dont approve of?\n\nA respectful conversation can go a long way. If it were me, I'd say something along the lines of, if you want me at your wedding I will be there. But \"me\" is a person who doesn't wear heels or makeup, so do you me.....or would it be best if I respectfully bow out so Im not a distraction or disappointment on your wedding day as I respect you wanting to have things a certain way.\n\nNTA fwiw", "NTA they can have you a guest as easy as a bridesmaid. Being told to be  uncomfortable and suck it up is dumb", "NTA \n\nI'm sorry that you're in this situation. Nobody should force you to do something that makes you uncomfortable, or feel like you're \"supposed\" to look/feel/be some way that you're not. \n\nBeing a teenager, your options and personal autonomy in the decision are limited. But if it's any consolation, my wife and I skipped a family wedding because the groom happens to be a Sikh man, and while he personally didn't care the temple wouldn't allow my wife entrance without covering her head and hair. She wasn't prepared to do that (being herself a former refugee from a Muslim country), and I supported her decision despite it hurting my family. \n\nEven if you ultimately don't get to make the choice this time, you will get to soon enough. Try to remember that. And good luck with whatever happens.", "NTA. You are an unwilling participant in this wedding, being asked to be a bridesmaid for someone you don\u2019t even like. If THEY want YOUR participation, THEY can suck it up and deal with your perfectly reasonable boundaries.\n\nTell her to find another bridesmaid if she doesn\u2019t like it. Or tell your dad to find another bride you actually like if he wants you to willingly endure makeup and heels. Their choice.", "NTA. You\u2019ll deal with people your whole life being upset that you won\u2019t wear heels or wear make up. You absolutely do not have to, and your parents should respect your wishes.\n\nIt\u2019s also rude of your future stepmom to say you look like you don\u2019t take care of yourself. Your dad should support you, not her.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to set your boundaries. They may acceptably say \u201cokay, then you can\u2019t be a bridesmaid\u201d. But it\u2019s okay for you to say no. \n\nBecause you\u2019re a minor, they can make you do it, but then they would be AHs, given your age and the likely damage they\u2019d do to your relationship over something that won\u2019t matter much the day after the wedding.", "NTA your Dad is thou. I'd never do this to my child.", "Hey man, I'm 22M and a fellow kid with a stepbitch from hell and just wanted to say this\n\nNTA, and never ever back down either. Sometimes dads let us down and care more about pleasing cuntzilla than their kids and it sucks but the best thing you can do is stick it to her and never give her control\n\nShe will burn with hatred for you just for living happily and comfortably if it's not on her terms, whether you do this for her or not. People like that don't change, and apparently loooove going for divorced fathers, so just a heads up if she's a permanent fixture to keep handling things how you did. You're a tough kid for not backing down", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou dont even want to do it in the first place. Why are they making you?", "Is there another adult in your life that could help mediate? This may be a case of them wanting to include you and forgetting you\u2019re old enough to have an opinion, and it may also be them blatantly disregarding you. We don\u2019t really know, and it sounds like you have all hit a brick wall here. You may need an outside perspective to work through it and find a compromise. (Oh, and any sane adult would consider matching flats and as little makeup as you are comfortable with an acceptable compromise.) NTA.", "NTA \n\nWhy would you force someone to be a bridesmaid? Nothing makes for a happy wedding like forced labor...", "NTA. No one should be forced to look a certain way to accommodate someone else\u2019s preferences. Even for a day. You are not an object and weddings with this kind of standard are ridiculous. Asking a woman to wear makeup at all is shameful! Let your natural beauty shine. I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re not validating your feelings.", "NTA. You have bodily autonomy.  You can be gracious in flats and chapstick.", "NTA. Men wouldn\u2019t be made to wear makeup and heels. Misogynist bull.", "NTA.  I didn\u2019t wear heels or makeup at my own wedding, either!", "I stopped at having no choice in being a bridesmaid.  That's the real issue.  Brides Do get an amount of say over how their wedding parties look/dress- however, one is asked to be a bridesmaid-asked.  One can say no.  No judgement b/c the question shouldn't even be an issue since it sounds like OP doesn't want to be in the wedding party.", "NTA they can\u2019t make you", "NTA, weddings are about joining the families together and it seems that neither of the parties involved actually care about you as more than an accessory, at least for this specific day. Like people can whine about how \"it's their day\" all they want, but, as this is the creation of a blended family it is far more complicated as the children from prior relationships should also matter, but again, seems they just view you as set dressing to appear as a perfect family unit.", "NTA - it\u2019s a really bad thing for a father to teach his daughter that her opinions about what she does and wears don\u2019t matter.  \n\nCan you talk to your mom about it?  Or another trusted adult?", "NTA - girl I didn\u2019t even wear heels to my own wedding, I walked down the aisle barefoot. And I almost never wear make up. Your dad is wrong for this.", "Orrrrrrr you go as a guest and feel comfortable and free for the night. Still NTA", "I\u2019m a 40+ woman and have never worn make-up, not even for my own wedding. I don\u2019t understand the idea that a woman must wear makeup. \n\nI also don\u2019t wear heels because I am a naturally tall girl and find heels uncomfortable. \n\nThere are many beautiful women who opt not to wear makeup, dresses or heels, and still very much look like the definition of a woman.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add. NTA", "NTA. I (57f) have not worn makeup for 20 years and I have never felt, or been told I\u2019m out of place for it. As for the shoes, a flat dyed in the same color the rest of the bridal party is wearing is completely appropriate, and would be cute too. Of course, the bride is free to rescind the offer of you being a bridesmaid; it\u2019s shallow, but her right to do so. It\u2019s not making a scene to stand up for yourself.", "NTA. she sounds shallow, taking good care of yourself doesn\u2019t mean looking perfect and girly all the time.", "NTA. No one will notice if you don't have makeup on. Maybe compromise and wear the heels for the ceremony and get the same color flats for the reception? Just a thought :)", "NTA get a pair of whatever converse in whatever colour the heels are,  I have a pair of white ones for my wedding that I wore. Also, you just use lip gloss. that is all you need.", "NTA and it is really vain and pathetic on their part.  Their wedding won't be ruined because you aren't in heels and face paint.", "NTA-You said you'd wear shoes that match. Plus, heels are hard to stand in for a long time so I wouldn't want to either. I think they are asking too much here. \n\nSide note...probably not the best thing to say...deal with it...to your dad. Maybe he's more mad about that, then anything else.", "NTA.\n\nYou stated your preference, and it's a very reasonable one. If they are concerned that you will look out of place in the wedding party, they can let you attend as a guest.", "NTA I'm surprised at the number of y t a here today.

Give them hell kid", "I think it\u2019s insanity that a grown woman is insisting a 16 year old kid should wear makeup and heels. That just feels icky to me. Obviously no matter what age OP was she shouldn\u2019t be forced to wear something she doesn\u2019t want to, but her age just makes it feel even weirder to me.

That could be a tactic for you. It gets you out of the \u2018suck it up for one day\u2019 given that just an hour in makeup and I feel the effects of it.

Flats/other formal shoes are a PERFECTLY fine alternative to heels. And makeup isn't a necessity either. If they really want you to be part of the wedding, they should accept that.

I'll be honest I don't like her. She cares too much about appearences and always has this stupid fake smile all the time. She always says I don't take care of myself enough, and gets upset that I don't get dressed as soon as I'm out of bed. Two things I absolutely will nevee wear are makeup and heels. I just don't like the way makeup makes me look, and heels just hurt so I don't bother.\n\nThe issue is they're making me be a bridesmaid (I didn't have a choice) and they're doing the matching dress thing. I actually like the dress they got for me, the problem is they got matching shoes too, and they're heels. \n\nShe's also getting annoyed at me for not wanting to wear makeup there either. She thinks I'll look out of place. I told them I'm willing to wear shoes that match, just not heels, and I'm not wearing makeup. My dad told me I should just suck it up for their day, but I told them I'm either going with no heels or makeup, or not at all deal with it. They've been pissy since, and some of my friends think I should just do it for them.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think the underlying problem here isn't make-up or shoes but the fact that you simply dislike your soon to be step-mother and the reason why they are acting \"pissy\" is the fact that you have made it quite clear to them that not only do you not like them but you don't care about their big day. \n\nI get it ... my dad and step-mother got married when I was a teenager and I wasn't a big fan of hers either but here's the thing that you got to keep in mind - you're gonna get older and move out and your step-mother is not going to be moving out with you.

If you enjoy wearing it, then wear it, but it's not a requirement of being a woman.  \n\nThere are only a handful of places where makeup is generally required and is so for everybody (like on stage because the lights are very unkind and you don't want to look ghostly or sickly when performing).", "And she can say, in a calm and cheerful voice, \u201cthanks for asking me, but I don\u2019t want to wear those clothes.\u201d", "No. They can\u2019t.", "No, she can't.", "I know you meant it to be inclusive but u can stick to just saying women, \"afabs\" includes trans dudes who obviously wouldn't be expected to wear makeup unless they're not out yet/have really crappy relatives. If u wanted to make sure to include feminine NB ppl I would say \"femmes\" instead! no worries either way tho", "The heels are especially egregious because of this. Ask your parents *why* you need to be in heels and not just matching flat shoes. \u201cBecause they make you look better!\u201d \u201cBetter how?\u201d \u201cYou know, sexier!\u201d And let them rot in the knowledge that they care more about their minor child\u2019s sex appeal than her comfort.", "For a play, sure. For choir or band concerts it\u2019s really not necessary. Especially if it\u2019s only directed at girls.", "It's absolutely what is happening.", "I can tell you exactly what will happen if you're not used to wearing heels. 3 years after shredding my ankle/leg in a motorcycle accident, I was shanghaied into being a last minute replacement in my cousin's wedding party where dress shoes were a requirement. I needed orthopedic arch support inserts in my normal footwear, but they didn't fit in the dress shoes. I was told the ceremony would be short so I thought I'd be ok. They lied. After standing for over an hour, my foot/ankle swelled to the point they were indistinguishable from my calf. I could barely walk & was in agony for the rest of the day. It took 3 days for swelling to go down.\n\nI strongly suggest wearing fancy flats no matter how much your dad & step-mother insist on heels. The pain you'll be in & the potential damage to your ankle just isn't worth it.\n\nEdited cuz my wayward thumb hit send to soon", "I agree, but just because someone is an asshole for doing something doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t possibly happen. Better for OP to consider the possibility and prepare for what she\u2019s ready to handle than to stand on principle and get blindsided. There are exceptions to the rule, but many 16yo are not the best at managing impulses and considering long term outcomes, so it\u2019s not a bad thing to point this out to her.", "SOME aren't bad.  I totally get them for the beach or special occasions.   BUT...I only go to one gal.  I've had shitty orange ones too...don't get me wrong.  But, when they're done right and with care, they can be really nice and boost confidence.", "Agreed. I\u2019m whiter than white and been told I look pale and sick my whole life. I\u2019ve been able to resist the urge to try to darken myself and do not understand why some of my friends are obsessed with it.\n\nThis is just my own particular shade of translucent and I\u2019ve accepted it. \ud83e\udd23", "Also, they're a teen. They'll look fine unless they're covered in pimples.", "i wish there was some kind of registry to sign up on: are you gonna blow up the ceremony? planning on objecting to the marriage taking place? please provide location date & time details so all us snarky locals can be sure to attend. we all hate weddings but really would hate to miss THIS one.", "It was hyperbole and a hypothetical of things she could do that she could 'blame' it on. I'm well aware that tourettes isn't cursing and screaming. I'm saying that she could play it as a card to get her dad to get off her dick about going as a 'but maybe it's a thing'. Billie Eilish and Lewis Capaldi both have the tic/frenetic movement type of tourettes and I know it's not funny. Some people make tiktoks to get popular over it and it's also not funny. But this whole scenario of being forced to be not only going to a wedding, but in the bridal party as well as what she has to wear that they know she doesn't? It's gross. So why not be gross in return?", "Well, making it look like you're taking pictures of a flashbang does hide the imperfections.", "No one seems concerned about how my fianc\u00e9 will look, washed out or otherwise!", "No, actually if they want to they can decide all the groomsmen must wear the same dresses as the bridesmaids, cis or trans. It would be a dick move, not to mention a touch unconventional, but they choose the wedding party attire. The options for the groomsmen would be to suck it up or back out. \n\nThe problem here is they aren\u2019t giving the girl the option of backing out, which is the right thing to do if the wedding party requirements are too much. \n\nAnd for the record, I\u2019m a long married cis woman who wore flats with her wedding gown and still regrets the super light touch of makeup everybody else says they can\u2019t see. To me it just looks wrong, so I don\u2019t like my own wedding pictures. I know exactly where OP is coming from. And I still think future step has the right to dictate bridal party attire and should let OP opt out.", "They\u2019re already making her miserable, she might as well do what she wants", "Like I said originally, I agreed with your sentiment. It's gross to force someone to do something against their will. But appropriating and misusing a legitimate medical diagnosis\u2014one with a lot of harmful stigma and stereotypes\u2014is *not* the proper response. \n\nYou acknowledge that it's inappropriate to fake Tourette's, yet still suggested it? That's truly disgusting. Please, stop. Be grateful you don't have this syndrome, that you can fully control all of your verbal and motor movements. Don't be a jerk trying to justify why ypu suggested it. \n\nThere's lots of ways that OP can fight back without faking a medical diagnosis. Which, by the way, if you're going to fake a sudden onset medical issue, Tourette's is definitely not the one to fake... it'd be obvious that the OP, who had never had a \"tic\" before, was faking with the sudden onset. Just if you want a little logic ;) \n\nHave a great night!", "OP offered that, not to be a bridesmaid.", "I love that!!!", "Canadian expat in Japan over here!", "This is what my SIL did for us as bridesmaids. Very much appreciated. I have a disability and can't wear heals so she also just asked for nude shoes no specific kind. Im not a makeup or hair person. 99% of the time its in a bun bc it bothers me down so I understand OP. Im a chemist. Why wear makeup if im always wearing goggles? Props to you for standing up for yourself. Maybe you could compromise on light blush and mascara? Thats what I wear if I HAVE to wear makeup but please don't wear heals if they make you uncomfortable I feel like that's non negotiable. You want to have fun celebrating not having your feet hurt and be tripping all night", "My sister chose black fit our dresses because all 6 of us showed up to her engagement party wearing black cocktail dresses. She was like \"well I guess their dress  colours picked\"  and then they had their \"colours\" as our flowers and accessories. And while we all wore make up, one of us doesn't normally where alot of it and never wears foundation so you know what, the make up artist didn't put foundation on her.", "I guess most bridesmaids indulge the bride because they chose to say yes to being a bridesmaid. OP didn\u2019t really have a say in the matter till now. So it\u2019s justifiable for her to not want to do things", "So you want someone who hasn't worn heels in over 4 years to wear them and possibly fall & break an ankle? That will really make the bride's day. When I got married, I picked the bridesmaids' dresses & that was it. I didn't care what shoes they wore. I just wanted everyone to have a good day & enjoy themselves at the reception.", "I personally don't agree that that's *okay*, because I've seen a lot of relationships break down over the bride making requests that the bridesmaids just weren't okay with. Because the *reality* of the situation is, while they have \"a choice\", the relationship will almost always be damaged if you turn down being a bridesmaid. It's not really a free choice, because the bride gets hurt if you don't wanna do it. If you're close enough that you're being asked, there's an *expectation* there that you're gonna say yes. \n\nWhich makes it a bigger deal when the bride then has ridiculous, sometimes harmful requests of their bridal party - because they \"had a choice\" but *really*, they didn't. Not if they wanted to keep that friendship on good terms. So when you then give them really silly rules to partake, in the name of \"it's my day and I can do whatever I want\", it does *feel* like you've been forced even if you technically haven't been.\n\nNot to mention - I'm of the belief that just because it's your wedding, that doesn't mean you don't still have to treat people with respect. You have to keep seeing those people *after* the wedding - the wedding does not exist in a bubble. Whatever you do to people during the wedding, they will remember afterwards. If the wedding is more important than your friendships, I'm questioning why you'd have them there at all. \n\nI get that it's a normal societal expectation - but like *many* normal societal expectations, I kinda think it's dumb and shouldn't exist.", "That depends on how much dirt the teen has on their parents, and whether the parents want to risk that information being revealed. If the parents are squeaky-clean, then the kid doesn't have jack to leverage. If, like most people, the parents have some skeletons they'd like to keep in the closet, then booting the kid out at 18 can be risky.\n\nI left of my own accord, fully supporting myself at 18. Good thing, because it could have gone badly for my parents otherwise.", "For more info, the term to Google is \u201cthe wisdom of crowds\u201d.\n\n(Then again, it's also been said that no single person can be as vicious and stupid as a mob, and the step from crowd to mob is small and ill-defined, so...)", "Yeah for makeup everyone did their own foundation and then one of them is really good at eyes so she did everyone\u2019s eye makeup. Like we\u2019re all late 20\u2019s to early 30\u2019s we know what looks good on us in terms of makeup.", "Mmhhh, yes..but also no. Very few people \"normally\" wear formal dresses or suits. But asking that for a wedding is pretty standard.\n\nAsking someone to wear something completely out of their comfort zone is a no-no for sure, but there is reasonable and unreasonable.\n\nExample: I dont like dresses. I wear a dress maybe 5 times a year total. As a bridesmaid I would assume wearing a formal dress is part of the gig and would happily suck up my preference for the day. But its a *preference*.\n\nThere's a difference between someone with a preference and someone who feels hugely uncomfortable wearing specific items of clothing. I dont think asking that's ok, personally.\n\nI think \"formal wear\" is a reasonable accommodation, but if I were to ask a gender non-conforming person to be in my wedding party I would *first* have a conversation about what theyd be comfortable wearing. TBH, I would be doing so with the goal of finding that person something they would be excited to wear for my wedding, not to push them into conforming and being uncomfortable.\n\nGenerally, Im of the \"you cant ask anyone to change anything they cant easily undo the day after\" camp. No drastic hair cuts (expecting a trim to neaten up is fine. Requesting 6 inches off or a totally different style, no), dying hair, long term treatments, etc. And I think its SUPER tacky to expect anyone to cover up things that are part of their expression - tattoos, scars, peircings, etc.\n\nJMO though. I love my friends for who they are. Asking them to pretend to be different people is disrespectful.", "Yep. I was in a dear friend's wedding a few years back. She gave us a color for our bridesmaid dresses (after consulting us on which colors we all felt comfortable with), then let us choose what dress we wanted / shoes we felt comfortable with. I wore a well loved pair of leather boots and she was tickled. She hired a makeup artist, but let us choose the level of makeup that we felt comfortable with. This idea that folks should totally change themselves to fit into an ideal is ridiculous. If we'd done a wedding (eloped because we just didn't want to go through the whole process), we would have skipped the bridesmaids / groomsmen (how do you choose when you have so many amazing people when you're in your late 30s / early 40s) and would have emphasized that we wanted people there because of who they were, not what they wore.", "Agree. I have not been to a single wedding in my *life* where everyone in the bridal party has actually had to wear the same dress. Even like fifteen years ago, at the very first weddings I attended - one of them had the seamstress individually make a unique dress for every member, the other was a t-shirt wedding where no one cared what you wore.\n\nMaybe it's more a thing in the US, or in rich circles. But in my social circles it has *never* been a thing to force everyone to match. Especially not at the bridesmaid's own cost, when they don't even get to *pick* the outfit. That always kinda felt ridiculous.", "I haven't worn heels in many years. If I was to try wearing them now, even for a friend's wedding, I'd probably end up in the ER with another broken ankle. OP is 16 & said she hasn't worn heels since she was 12 & only wore them for about 12 minutes. Forcing her to wear heels now would be a huge mistake & could potentally put her in the ER with a broken ankle or worse."]}
