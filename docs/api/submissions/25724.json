She is still reps9nisble and could've told everyone to wait and just get the train we were all meant to rather than be okay with leaving me behind", "I get the feeling the bride will probably freak because she doesn\u2019t want to look like a bad friend (she doesn\u2019t care about acting like one though)", "Yeah all randomly decided to get an earlier train than the one we should've gotten. I had to get on the one we all had orginially  booked and it happened tk be delayed by 15 mins so I missed the connecting train and they decided to get on it anyway and leave me there for a second time.", "If you'd acrually to read the basic facts: I did not buy a cheap ticket. We all bought the same bloody ticket at the same price for the same time. Some companies have different types of tickets. \nWe also agreed we'd all travel at that time, so it shouldn't matter.\n\nAnd if you want to shit on someone based off of money: I spent A LOT of money making sure the bride had things she wanted and needed when other attendees did not bevause they aren't bridemaids.", "why wouldn't you change your ticket?", "Yeah, exactly, it won't be anything genuine.", "That\u2019s not cool they all ditched you like that \n\nThese girls are your friends?", "It would cost them to do so, and why should they pay for it?", "Nobody could change their ticket we all bought the same train tickets for the same price, some companies just have different ticket types they randomly advertise at times. \nWe all agreed to get the same time so it shouldn't matter", "This.", "Should probably mention that the other BM's are her friends, I had never actually met any of them until the weekend. My issue with the bride is that she just stood and watched these other pals treat me like shit instead of saying \"hey let's wait 10 mins\"", "YTA - You got shafted on travel and you are taking it out on the bride when she had very little to do with it.  \n\n\nIf your relationship was already done and this is the last straw that is fine, but this was like half the other BM being rude and half your own travel planning fuck up.", "Nta", "You definitely got used as a party planner. NTA", "NTA, they all sucked", "1) it was not a travel plan fuck up when we all agreed to get that particular train. Like 20 mins hardly makes a difference. I'll say this one last time- we all booked the same train, same time, its just the app gave some of them different ticket types.\nAlso she could've said \"hey let's wait for...\" or she had full control over what the other BM's did and she allowed them to do that and didn't try stop them. It was her bloody weekend.", "Maybe they were concerned about the tight turn around between trains, and decided not to risk missing the connection if there were delays. It sucks if they didn\u2019t communicate if that\u2019s what they were thinking though.", "Shrug, basic facts would suggest they were not, in fact, the same ticket.  I did make an assumption on price.   Still don\u2019t see why it would be better for everyone to miss the connecting train\u2026", "Then we all should have collectively  agreed to book a different time. It also literally doesn't matter, you just jump on the next train which was why I was confused.", "How was your connection so tight that a 15 min delay screwed it all up?  You probably all should have booked the earlier first train...\n\nThey were dicks - at least one should have waited for you but why didn't you catch the next one?", "I did catch the next one, but why couldn't they have just simply got the damn train we were all supposed to get? 15 mins is honestly pretty decent for a small train station.", "A lot of commenters here don\u2019t seem to realise how train tickets work in the UK (I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s where you are?). Depending on which one you buy your ticket from out of the various websites available you can be given different \u201cpermitted\u201d routes because the companies that sell the tickets are different. The only way to get the exact same ticket is if one person bought them all then distributed them out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting times can also be very close and they are *automatically chosen by the ticket company*. I caught one that involved a 15 minute walk across London as part of the connection (Euston to Pancras) and it was only a 22 minute connection. If you\u2019re a slow walker you\u2019ve got no hope, you\u2019d have to book them as separate journeys and pay much more for the pleasure. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo NTA. It\u2019s not your fault your ticket was slightly different. It\u2019s not your fault the train was delayed. It\u2019s not your fault the connection was tight. It is the brides fault for basically saying \u201clol bye\u201d and leaving you to travel alone.", "NTA.  I do wonder though if them changing the times is exactly because they thought what happened might happen - miss the connection.  It would be a logical thing to do if someone told them it occurs.", "Honey, I hate to break it to you, but that was all done on purpose. Ditch them and move on.", "NTA those are not friends. Block them all. Go no contact. Live a great life!", "I don\u2019t get the ticket situation. Same ticket , they all can transfer but you cannot. That utterly makes no sense. I do get the rudeness.", "NTA. They ditched you.", "NTA. This is a one-sided friendship and you should end it. Seek better people to hang around with.", "crappy by ALL the bridal party.", "Oooh.  Yeah.   That was crappy on her part.  NTA.", "I'm just curious now? Were they all inebriated? Because I can't defend her for not sticking with the plan and sticking with you - no matter who suggested bailing and leaving you alone. You're 100 percent in the right about that. (I would just be PO'd at everyone involved.)", "> you just jump on the next train\n\nHow is there so much flexibility for **connections**, but you couldn't use your initial ticket on a train at a slightly different time?", "Again, companies will chop and change terms and conditions  for certain tickets even though someone has bought the same train and ticket. Welcome to the shitshow that is public transport. \nAlso doesn't really negate what they did.", "[deleted]", "If OP is in England then this scenario is entirely feasible. You have to stick to the ticket until the train being delayed affects your journey. Then you have flexibility. And most train guards will charge full journey price if you\u2019re on the wrong train for any reason other than cancelled or delayed train.", "Go out to a nice dinner instead of the wedding, enjoy yourself!  NTAH.", "It was only 10 minutes earlier? WTF?", "We're they able to travel on the same train as you with their ticket type? Would that still have been the case if they had not taken the connecting train that you missed, but waited for a later one with you?", "An inflexible train ticket is similar to an airplane ticket. You can\u2019t board the earlier flight bc you have booked a certain time/flight and when you miss your connecting flight with the same carrier, they get you on the next flight. Conductors know which connections are running late which would allow OP to get on the next connecting train.", "INFO: how long was this train ride?", "NTA it seems they don\u2019t care as much, and you shouldn\u2019t be gracing them with your presence any longer. Anyone who takes a train that your \u201cfriend\u201d can\u2019t take and then leaves you for dead is no friend.", "You did a lot for someone who was using you as a place filler and money. Too bad you spent a lot of money before figuring out the friendship actually died years ago. NTA.", "NTA, if you have not communicated with her about this just block her and the rest of the party.  If she does find a way to get in contact with you tell her, you thought she kicked you out of the wedding party, so you made other plans, do not even say sorry when you tell her.", "NTA But you missed the opportunity to just not show up on the day of.", "The bride is her friend and the bride should have told everyone they would be sticking to the original plan. We have no idea what OP's relationship is to the other bridesmaids - but they most likely would have honored the bride's wishes had she done the right thing."]}
