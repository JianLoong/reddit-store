Good for you mom!!", "NTA and you are doing a great job with ypur son.", "NTA as it was your dad your boy was rude to but your dad is on your side, so that says it all.\n\nYour son also realised his behaviour was wrong as thats why he excused himself, he was using the tools you have given him. So obviously what you are doing is working well for both your son and you.\n\nYeah your bro has no leg to stand on, you cant tell someone how to parent if you dont do it yourself.", "NTA. Your dad having raised sons knows that you're doing the best you can. Your son was in the system for a reason and like many foster kids has a list of issues which he and you are working on. That list is getting smaller and easier to deal with over time. Do not apologize. 3 kids that he rarely sees and only pays enough child support to get his licenses reinstated every year is not the man to give anyone advice on how to raise any kids.", "NTA and mom should stop trying to keep things peaceful for her deadbeat son", "It sounds like you're doing a fantastic job with your son, and your dad seems supportive too. Your brother is exactly what you said he is, NTA.", "This.  Brother and mother are the AH.

The son is showing a lot of maturity by realizing he's getting volatile and excusing himself until he's calmed down enough to have a level conversation. \n\nI had a lot of anger issues growing up, especially in the last few years. The worst thing someone could do was block me from leaving because it would cause me to get overwhelmed and explode. Literally all I needed was a minute or two away to calm down enough to talk. It gives everyone involved some time to reflect and get into a better headspace before tackling whatever issue is at hand.\n\nGood on you, OP, for standing up for your son and listening to his needs. If your brother wants to parent, he can start with his own children.", "He's a really great kid. He had so many issues when he came to me two years ago. And with covid and online school he really had to overcome so much. \n\nMy original plan was short term fostering, but covid prolonged everything. His parents then lost their parental rights for good and we ( my son and I) discussed me adopting him and he is really excited about it. I love the kid to death, really. And most of my family accepted him great.", "Oh my dad's lecture wasn't so much a lecture really. He was asking my son about school and telling him he really needs to put in the work this year. My son got upset because he recently got some bad grades (but my dad didn't know). My dad and son have a really good relationship otherwise.", "Thank you! He's a great kid, really. He's super funny, he's kind, he has the kind of empathy that I needed 30+ years to learn. He's amazing. He was dealt a shit hand at life, and will have to carry the weight of his upbringing with him for the rest of his life, and that just kills me. But hopefully we'll do alright together. \u2764\u2764", "You both will do better than alright because you're showing up every day to help him."]}
