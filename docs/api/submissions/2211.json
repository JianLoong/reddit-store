So obviously what you are doing is working well for both your son and you.\n\nYeah your bro has no leg to stand on, you cant tell someone how to parent if you dont do it yourself.", "NTA. Your dad having raised sons knows that you're doing the best you can. Your son was in the system for a reason and like many foster kids has a list of issues which he and you are working on. That list is getting smaller and easier to deal with over time.

The son is showing a lot of maturity by realizing he's getting volatile and excusing himself until he's calmed down enough to have a level conversation. \n\nI had a lot of anger issues growing up, especially in the last few years. The worst thing someone could do was block me from leaving because it would cause me to get overwhelmed and explode. Literally all I needed was a minute or two away to calm down enough to talk.

He's super funny, he's kind, he has the kind of empathy that I needed 30+ years to learn. He's amazing.

All it did was make our relationship worse and then in turn she would end up hearing me lash out because I couldn\u2019t walk away and decompress properly. I commend you for understanding what your son needs and for handing it in a way that works best for him. Your brother needs to step off, every child has different needs and parenting should adjust to that, not that your brother would really know.", "lol, the audacity of your brother to talk about parenting...\n\nNTA, you don't owe him shit and dad is right, he's not a good parent so he needs to learn to keep his mouth shut", "Your brother has absolutely no right, I've worked with kids with PTSD etc... I'm damn near shaking, he would say something so...he has no fucking clue. I don't know your foster son but I'm proud of him sticking to his safe coping skills.

At 14 that didn't even cross my mind.", "Back in the good ol days, when gas was less than $2/gal, I used to drive around for hours to decompress if I felt I was on the verge of a major meltdown; technology was no where near as advanced as it is today but we had call forwarding on cellphones so I'd forward my calls to my landline lol.

That would be the right way of encouraging adult convo. \nIam a firm believer that if u treat with respect, respect is returned. \nIm also going to just suggest that you look into martial arts.

He offered you his unsolicited opinion.\nYou simply gave him your opinion in return.", "All kids are different, you know your own kid and the best way to parent. Kids with additional needs or issues behaviour/mental health have to do things differently in terms address poor behaviour due be feeling overwhelmed or upset. It doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t discipline them but you look at the what happen, discuss why it happened and decide from there.\n\nNo one has the right to question your parenting techniques not even other parents. Also, definitely not your brother who is taking no responsibility of parenting his own kids or paying child support. \n\nSo don\u2019t apologise to him, he had no right say what he said.

First, it sounds like you are doing a fantastic job. I was a delinquent teen and I still have serious mental health problems. I have some idea how difficult that is from that perspective. That you are understanding about the episodes and that he knows that you are and trusts that well enough to explain, on his own, that he needs some time to himself is fantastic, even if he spit the words out angrily.\n\nYour brother has no right to criticize you. Even if he was a fantastic dad, and that doesn't sound like it's even remotely the case, that doesn't mean he knows all about the specific issues your son has or that he's even remotely aware of the situations many fostered kids go through or have gone through. He's definitely TA. He owes you the apology.", ">my dad thinks my brother was way out of line\n\nThat's because he was.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Yer dad's the one with the right opinion here. Don't apologize, honestly. Your brother doesn't deserve it, and an apology is probably going to be seen as a 'go ahead' to keep doing it. And dang. That kid of yours is working through their problems beautifully. Mad respect to him for realizing that he was an INCH away from truly fucking up and taking the measures to correct that all on his own.", "NTA \n\nI presume when your foster son came back if he didn\u2019t apologize for being rude you discussed it with him at the table, he understood what was unacceptable and apologized for being rude to your dad. \n\nAnd IMO you are correct that while your brother was entitled to his opinion that your foster son was rude to your father, he had no business telling you anything on how to raise a child.", "NTA. That was the perfect response!", "NTA, it might be worth pointing out that your son is not an adult yet. At 14, nobody expects perfect temper control. Your son showed a lot of maturity in being able to remove himself from the situation - and even more if he was able to come back and apologize for being rude. (But again, not unreasonable for him to struggle with that too, as he has a difficult background", "NTA\n\nAt 20 my go to method is to just shut down mid conversation because my family doesn\u2019t allow me this option. When I was under 18 and I\u2019d get frustrated/angry and walk away to cool off I\u2019m immediately told \u2018get back here or you\u2019re grounded\u2019 or similar phrases.

And it shows that OPs patience and teaching are having a positive effect on the son.", "THIS!  Obviously your way is working if you son is now actively practicing the methods of calming down that you are using.  That is just unbelievably incredible for a young man with his background.  Do not apologize to anyone.  If brother wants to give advise, he should also be prepared to take it, and you mother needs to stop blindly supporting him.    \nObviously, NTA.", "OP is an angel!", "I find this super inspiring :) well done you. \n\nI hope to do something similar a bit later in life and it\u2019s great to hear such a positive story (which, despite your brother being an AH, this is).", "Forgive me if I'm making any assumptions here, it even sounds like your dad understands what happened there (your son getting heated and excusing himself from the situation before things got out of hand). NTA, your brother needed a reality check and it sounds like your mom is embarrassed. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed by your brother and his behavior too.", "As a parent of a teenager: Thanks for being a great parent. The future of our planet lies in the hands of this generation, they better be good people :D", "Since he's going to therapy and taking it seriously, I think your son will continue to improve.  \n\nMeanwhile, your brother has zero excuses for his own behavior and has nowhere to stand.\n\nNTA.", "It also sounds like your dad was OK with how the situation went down if he thinks your brother is way out of line, which means that your brother isn't \"defending\" anyone, he's just wanting to be an asshole. \n\nAnd your brother must know - or *could* know if he wanted to - that your son has had an incredibly difficult life (he doesn't need details; just knowing he has PTSD *at fourteen* should be enough, for fuck's sake). A reasonably compassionate person would understand that that means making allowances for him that maybe you wouldn't make if you knew the kid had grown up privileged and without problems.  \n\nYour brother just absolutely lacks compassion, and I assume you already know that he should never be around your kid alone, because who knows what hurtful things he'd say to him. \n\nYour mother also needs a lesson in compassion, since she thinks YOU were the one who was out of line. Why is she defending a grown man who refuses to parent his own kids, instead of defending a 14yo child who has spent too much of his life without *anyone* defending him? It might be worth having a conversation with her about whether she actually agrees with your brother, in which case you may also need to watch her interactions with your son more closely. \n\nYour dad's a good egg, though, thank goodness.", "At 14 it would have occurred to me, but there is no way I would have been allowed to disengage until which ever parent was done throwing their temper tantrum.", "Same and I still have trouble walking away.", "Yeah I had an issue with that the last time I needed to and my partner didn't want me leaving \"in that state.\" He now understands that sometimes I just need to nope out for a bit. We have a plan in place now and things are better. \n\nIt didn't help that lots of intense EMDR was dredging up thing and messing with my ability to use my coping skills. I talked with my therapist and we're cutting back the EMDR and mixing in sessions to review and practice emotional regulation plans.", "My husband will follow me. My kids are smarter than him and give me my space."]}
