A reasonably compassionate person would understand that that means making allowances for him that maybe you wouldn't make if you knew the kid had grown up privileged and without problems.  \n\nYour brother just absolutely lacks compassion, and I assume you already know that he should never be around your kid alone, because who knows what hurtful things he'd say to him. \n\nYour mother also needs a lesson in compassion, since she thinks YOU were the one who was out of line.

As a former foster youth who also had a rough start I can tell you that the help you\u2019re giving him now is going to have an impact on who he becomes. I\u2019m 35 and still trying to learn to cope and manage my moods and behaviors because I didn\u2019t have someone supporting me like he does. So don\u2019t ever doubt you\u2019re a good parent. And your brother can eat shit cuz he sounds like a loser.", "I still need to learn that skill! In my 50's & will retaliate which hardly ever ends well.", "i also think it\u2019s great that you are helping him learn strategies to calm himself down. you are raising a respectful and introspective young man, one who probably wouldn\u2019t have had a chance to be the man he will become as he grows if not for you. your brother should commend you for not only stepping up and being a father to a kid who has had an extremely difficult life and consequently has a lot of issues, for raising him to be respectful, for having a good relationship with open communication with your son. i absolutely admire you as a parent and think you are doing great. you are absolutely NTA.", "So true tho lol", "Not necessarily, it could just be that it's the first year of highschool for him, and things count more now.", "Yeah it's harder to just scream into a pillow or whatever when someone follows you and keeps \"yipping\" at you. I had to use the words, \"honey, I love you but I need a timeout or I'm gonna loose my shit. Please back off when I need to take 10 minutes to calm the fuck down.\"\n\nHaving him read bits from my DBT workbook helped. He's understands now that I'm not running away from him, but that I'm trying to shield him from volatile emotions that I have to reign in. It's nothing about him and everything about me maintaining my own chill.", "So I was both curious and concerned because I'd heard how intense EMDR is, but I've let trauma responses rule me for over 40 years and I'm sick of it. Here's what I've learned in the last few months.\n\nPart of the reason EMDR is so painful for people is you have to choose a trauma to work on and then use memories of triggering events to examine in depth. You have to identify the main emotions you felt during the triggering events and that is awful and draining. \n\nFrom there you work with those emotions and begin affirming their opposites. So if the negative was something like \"I'm worthless,\" you start thinking about times where you felt worthy. I think I spent a week staring at post it notes all over my house with \"I am worthy,\" written on them along with different examples of memories where I felt the positive emotion. Then the real work starts.\n\nA good therapist will ALWAYS strive to keep their patient within their window of tolerance. It's different for every person. Some folks can do EMDR weekly. Others can only do it monthly. In between EMDR there has to be processing time. \n\nSo when you experience EMDR stimulation you have to feel both physically and mentally safe. You create a mental refuge to help soothe yourself after the stimulation. That's important. \n\nI do not know the science behind how EMDR works. I do know that something in the way you think about whatever that original triggering memory while your eyes are being stimulated changes the way you view the memory. Like it's all still there, but if starts to hurt less. I started one session just thinking about a snapshot of a memory that was a 10/10 in terms of distress. In an hour I was replaying the entire memory and only feeling a 3/10 in terms of distress. I also couldn't hold the triggering memory and the negative emotions together in my head. The memory  just... there and I knew I wasn't worthless.\n\nThis isn't to say I don't feel worthless from time to time since then. What I don't have is the crippling sense of worthlessness that made me want to curl up in a ball and give up on life. It's like a \"normal\" amount of negative emotion and not a runaway mack truck on the mental highways playing merry hell with my brain.\n\nI spend about 4 days after a stimulation session just processing and doing self care. I work jigsaw puzzles, sometimes 3 in a week to help myself relax and process. Some people paint or work out while they process. But I tend to hole up in the quiet.\n\nMy dreams are different. Fewer night terrors, but also they're more interesting at times. They also lack the odd feeling of dread that they used to have. I'm not afraid to sleep at night anymore. \n\nI've lost weight because I'm not emotionally eating like I used to. I hadn't even noticed until I got covid19 and was weighed at the prompt care. But i dropped like 10 pounds so far.\n\nI also find it more difficult to get into negative thought spirals. They still can happen, but it's also easier to pop myself out of them when they do. No amount of talk therapy has done that for me in 20 years. My first EMDR session was this past August. I'm experiencing more of myself, my real self not what the trauma was hiding, every day.\n\nNot every therapist who is certified in EMDR is good. Some are idiots who don't pay attention to their patient's tolerance levels. I know of a therapist local to me that was trying to give EMDR to incarcerated persons.... prisons are NOT safe places, so she was just further damaging people. \n\nTl dr; EMDR is a powerful therapy tool and when used correctly can drastically improve quality of life for trauma patients. It's hard and sometimes painful. A good therapist will check in with you about where you're experiencing stress in your body, how much distress you feel, etc and have you decide if you can continue or need to rest. \n\nOn one hand I wish I'd done it sooner. On the other I don't know if I'd have been as prepared for it as I am now.\n\nIf you have more questions, shoot me a DM.", "NTA!", "NTA", "You and your father are NTA. I commend you for taking a child with a rough background and teaching him coping skills. It is not easy, especially if you did not have him from birth until 12. I shudder to think where he would be without you right now. A child can have all the social workers in the world, but it is also critical to have a good foster parent who continues the same process at home. I hope you experience a smooth adoption, or as smooth as possible.", "NTA - As someone who grew up with a dad that is just like your brother I will tell your brother his future now I have no love for my dad I don't hate him he just doesn't deserve a spot in my life and if he died tomorrow it would be just another Tuesday to me", "So, your mother supports brother being a deadbeat insufferable AH?\n\nNTA\n\nIf your method works with your kiddo  then that is the right way.  \nPlus, you are being strict - just not abusively so.", "NTA If he's going to open \"that\" door then he should be prepared for the responses he gets.", "NTA, at 14 there was no way I was able to excuse myself knowing I\u2019m getting vexed. I didn\u2019t have that control. The fact he does, for me, is a pretty good indication you are doing a good job.", "NTA You have a method and it works. Sounds like you've discussed it with your dad and he understands. Your brother can just go fly a kite", "Right, people who get upset when you try to respectfully remove yourself are the worst.\n\nHad a confrontation with a coworker, tried to leave she yelled after me I was sad and childish\n\n.....well now I'm better at staying gone. Was not then. I lost it on her. Let people remove themselves from conflict like damn.", "Exactly.", "The thing is the process takes time so it\u2019s really important to have solid coping skills for whatever comes up.", "NTA and DO NOT APOLOGIZE! You sound like a spectacular dad and I'm proud of you. Fuck your brother.", "Was dad OK with your method of your sending your son out of the room to cool off? You have a method that works well with your son. Your mother is asking the wrong son to apologise. Your brother doesn't parent so he is in no place to criticise people who do. I would suggest NEVER leaving your son alone with your brother. Your dad is on your side on this", "NTA. You are dealing with your childs issues, and to others it may seem inappropriate however YOU know your child best and what works with him. I too have a child with an explosive temper, and at 16 now, he generally walks away to calm himself and does a very good job with it. Rarely do I have to step in anymore, unless its to get my husband to back off. Keep up the good work, your kid needs your support to help him get on the road to success!", "We see whose moms favorite is because anybody hearing this conversation knowing he\u2019s a deadbeat wouldn\u2019t open their mouths to defend him", "Why not?", "And the brother doesn\u2019t even know his own kids. He can sit that one out", "NTA- You are teaching him coping mechanisms and working with therapists...and he's a foster child. The amount of compassion and patience you have is amazing. You're supporting him, working through his issues with therapists and talking out things with him and it's truly beautiful. Your brother was out of line and I would have snapped at him too. I hope the adoption goes smoothly and I wish you and your son the best.", "It really wasn't like that. They talk about school all the time and my das is very supportive of him. He knows where my son struggles and where he shines, he helps him with his math homework etc. I chose the wrong word when I said it was a lecture.", "Thank you! My dad always used to take us fishing, now he takes his grandkids. I go sometimes, but they really dont want me there \ud83d\ude02", "They were talking and then my dad had a monologue on the importance of edcuation, yeah. He wasn't implying that my son didn't do well enough in school or anything like that.", "Thank you sooo much for taking the time to explain your experience and thoughts on it. I\u2019m in the same position as far as how long I\u2019ve let my childhood trauma interfere and influence my life. I will probably take you up on the offer to Dm you at some point in the next couple days.", "They aren't exactly the same, but they are similar enough if you can't do one, you probably won't be able to do the other. The purposes are different, but there are a lot of similarities in mode."]}
