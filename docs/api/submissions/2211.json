Good for you mom!!", "NTA and you are doing a great job with ypur son.", "NTA as it was your dad your boy was rude to but your dad is on your side, so that says it all.\n\nYour son also realised his behaviour was wrong as thats why he excused himself, he was using the tools you have given him. So obviously what you are doing is working well for both your son and you.\n\nYeah your bro has no leg to stand on, you cant tell someone how to parent if you dont do it yourself.", "NTA. Your dad having raised sons knows that you're doing the best you can. Your son was in the system for a reason and like many foster kids has a list of issues which he and you are working on. That list is getting smaller and easier to deal with over time. Do not apologize. 3 kids that he rarely sees and only pays enough child support to get his licenses reinstated every year is not the man to give anyone advice on how to raise any kids.", "NTA and mom should stop trying to keep things peaceful for her deadbeat son", "It sounds like you're doing a fantastic job with your son, and your dad seems supportive too. Your brother is exactly what you said he is, NTA.", "This.  Brother and mother are the AH.  NTA", "Seriously I'm in my mid-twenties and will often forget to separate myself before saying something stupider when I get emotional, this is a beautiful skill for a 14 yr old to ha e and something we should all be capable of", "NTA\n\nI never got why people are so pissy about leaving to decompress in heated scenarios. The son is showing a lot of maturity by realizing he's getting volatile and excusing himself until he's calmed down enough to have a level conversation. \n\nI had a lot of anger issues growing up, especially in the last few years. The worst thing someone could do was block me from leaving because it would cause me to get overwhelmed and explode. Literally all I needed was a minute or two away to calm down enough to talk. It gives everyone involved some time to reflect and get into a better headspace before tackling whatever issue is at hand.\n\nGood on you, OP, for standing up for your son and listening to his needs. If your brother wants to parent, he can start with his own children.", "He's a really great kid. He had so many issues when he came to me two years ago. And with covid and online school he really had to overcome so much. \n\nMy original plan was short term fostering, but covid prolonged everything. His parents then lost their parental rights for good and we ( my son and I) discussed me adopting him and he is really excited about it. I love the kid to death, really. And most of my family accepted him great.", "Oh my dad's lecture wasn't so much a lecture really. He was asking my son about school and telling him he really needs to put in the work this year. My son got upset because he recently got some bad grades (but my dad didn't know). My dad and son have a really good relationship otherwise.", "Thank you! He's a great kid, really. He's super funny, he's kind, he has the kind of empathy that I needed 30+ years to learn. He's amazing. He was dealt a shit hand at life, and will have to carry the weight of his upbringing with him for the rest of his life, and that just kills me. But hopefully we'll do alright together. \u2764\u2764", "You both will do better than alright because you're showing up every day to help him.", "NTA. Your mom wants to keep the peace, therefore is telling the person most likely (in her opinion) to smooth it over (apparently thats you), to apologize to smooth it over. But you\u2019re not wrong. Even your dad thinks so.", "NTA, when I was in high school and I\u2019d get into fights with my mom, I\u2019d excuse myself to make sure I could come back without lashing out and saying things I\u2019d regret. My mom never respected it and would instead tell everyone that we got into an argument and that I was being ridiculous while I was within earshot to hear everything she said. All it did was make our relationship worse and then in turn she would end up hearing me lash out because I couldn\u2019t walk away and decompress properly. I commend you for understanding what your son needs and for handing it in a way that works best for him. Your brother needs to step off, every child has different needs and parenting should adjust to that, not that your brother would really know.", "lol, the audacity of your brother to talk about parenting...\n\nNTA, you don't owe him shit and dad is right, he's not a good parent so he needs to learn to keep his mouth shut", "Your brother has absolutely no right, I've worked with kids with PTSD etc... I'm damn near shaking, he would say something so...he has no fucking clue. I don't know your foster son but I'm proud of him sticking to his safe coping skills. And thank you for fostering one of too many kids that get lost in the system.", "You didn't lie. He **is** a deadbeat and he knows it.\n\nNTA. Also, sounds like you're an understanding and patient dad. Bravo!", "You did right \n, Why should you apologize when he want.\nWe all know your brother is the adult golden child.\n\nNTA\n\nYou sound like an amazing dad to that young man keep doing an amazing job dad.", "What would you possibly apologize for?

He has learned how to calm himself and communicate effectively while angry.\n\nGood dad!", "I like the only person who could even have a right to be mad would be the dad since your son was a little rude to him, and even he thinks your brother is full of shit. That\u2019s how Yk your brother is wrong. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour brother is a deadbeat dad. But, I would argue even if he was an involved dad, his opinion would still be shit.\n\nIt sounds like your brother thinks being a good parent is having a kid comply based out of fear. eff that. You\u2019re working with therapists to help a traumatized child.", "Why do parents here always think the defender should apologize to the defender?  It\u2019s obvious your brother was wrong and Mimi\u2019s the AH not you.", "NTA- your mom is upset at herself for raising a deadbeat dad", "NTA. If more people allowed cooling off time after something like that, everyone would be better off! No matter what, he shouldn\u2019t criticize your parenting period.", "Even if he wasn't a deadbeat he still would not have an idea what it takes to give a home to a traumatized teenager and help him to deal  with anger issues (which definitely doesn't take strict discipline but love and respect and calm boundaries). You are doing a great job and it is wonderful that people like you exist and help to break the cycle of violence and abuse. \n\nThe fact that he is a deadbeat makes it even worse, though. \nDefinitely NTA.", "All I will say is this, parents never think their kids are as bad as they actually are.", "[deleted]", "Yeah I think so too. I was well into my 20s when I learned the coping mechanisms my son already has at 14. I was actually super proud of him when he peacefully excused himself. At 14 that didn't even cross my mind.", "Back in the good ol days, when gas was less than $2/gal, I used to drive around for hours to decompress if I felt I was on the verge of a major meltdown; technology was no where near as advanced as it is today but we had call forwarding on cellphones so I'd forward my calls to my landline lol. It takes a lot of self awareness to realize you need to remove yourself from a potentially volatile situation.", "Stolen comment https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/yu2d95/_/iw7r6fi", "Hell I'm in my 40's and just learning those same coping skills.
