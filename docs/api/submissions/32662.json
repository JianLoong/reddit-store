It's normal to be worried about this, especially if she kept it from you. But that also doesn't mean she's planning on cheating either.\n\nWhat would worry me even more is that she kept it from you because she's afraid of telling you stuff you don't want to hear. This can be because of your reactions in the past, or because of her own insecurities. With my ex it was the latter, and it never changed. Anything he even remotely tought I wasn't gonna like he just did behind my back. After a couple years there's just no respect left.", "NTA.\nIf my gf told me that someone whom she had never met but has flirted online with is coming to town and the only place he has to stay is at her house? Dunno, trust aside, that is weird. A night or 2 I can see, but dude is literally planning a vacation to stay at your girls house... and they've only met online...", "NTA, You have every right to be. Many people would not like their partner ex\u2019s, fwb , or anything sexual relations staying with them. It\u2019s a major boundary that many people have. She should have communicated this prior that they would be coming. It\u2019s about communication and honesty. If they hide it, I would be curious and upset as to why. Especially if they have past history.\n\nLike I wouldn\u2019t go to my past fwb place and stay over, as there would be underlying intentions. Once you cross the line and get into bed, It\u2019s not a regular friendship anymore and it\u2019s hard to turn back.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you stumbled into some information your GF was concealing from you; something as important as having another man stay at her home for a week. Bet you're glad you inadvertently started that ball rolling with your joke. Unfortunately, it sounds like she's a bit sensitive about being thought of or called a cheater while she's planning to cheat. Maybe she's clinging to a technicality; doesn't want to be called out before she actually does the dirty deed. Also unfortunately, you should be moving on with your life without her contact information. The alarm bells are ringing.", "NTA for being upset.
