My girlfriend's family who live in a small town invited us to join them for christmas this year. And per usual, her parents would pay for her flying expenses (ticket) so she could attend (she an't afford it since she's a broke college student). We've been together for 5 months and I pretty much want to come BUT,, they're only going to pay for my girlfriend's ticket but not mine. I talked to my girlfriend and pointed out how they paid for her BIL (her sister's husband) she said it's 'different' since he's their son inlaw and that her parents aren't \"obligated\" to pay for me since they barely know me. I said it didn't matter how long they've known me, as a guest, I should recieve the same treatment as everybody else. I told her I won't come unless my ticket is paid for. period. She got mad and said it was weird for me to expect them to pay and that it was up to me to figure it out. I said cool then I'm not coming.\n\n\n\n\nShe's very upset with me saying I'm being ridiculous making a fuss over a plane ticket after her parents respected me enough to invite me to join their celebration. She's expecting me to take it back.\n\n\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nFolks, listen. I'm not demanding they pay. I'm NOT trust me but she keeps accusing me of choosing to spend our first christmas together as acouple away from her over a plane ticket. She see it as petty, I see it as a reaction. also.

Also, it's downright ridiculous to think that if someone invites you to stay at theirs over the christmas holidays they should pay your way because you're \"a guest\". You kinda give the impression that you're a very difficult, entitled but also insecure and fragile person. \n\nGetting fixated and willing to ruin holidays and relations with your gf's family over turning tiny things into massive issues related to \"respect\" - it's not a good look. \n\nIf your gf's family respected you before, they sure as heck won't anymore after it dawns on them you threw a tantrum and refused to spend christmas with your gf just because her family didn't fork out cash for your ticket.", "YTA.

They may do the same for you in the future, but I think you\u2019re making sure that doesn\u2019t happen by your behaviour now. \nIt was kind of them to invite you, and if you\u2019re not willing to make the effort now bcs they should  \u2018respect\u2019 you- when you aren\u2019t respecting them- then you\u2019re probably doing everyone a favour by showing them who you are\nYTA", "YTA you've been together 5 FLIPPING MONTHS!!!

If money was the issue then you should have just said you appreciate the offer and would love to come but you can\u2019t afford it.

They are generous to invite you at all. \n\nYou could have asked your gf to go half\u2019s with you on your tickets. That would have been fairs as you would forgo Christmas with your own family to spend time with her and hers. But that might be too late now that you\u2019ve started out demanding to be catered to.", "YTA. Since you seem unclear how these proceedings go, allow me to clarify. You're a tertiary guest at best. You're not obligated to come, and they're not obligated to pay for you. If you don't want to go, then don't.

Honestly you sound insufferable.", "YTA\n\nYou're not married and haven't been together long, they don't have an obligation to pay for you.

You are not their kid so of course you pay yourself.", "YTA, overly entitled, and hopefully forever alone until you GROW UP.", "YTA. BIL is family.

Your sense of entitlement is not a good thing.", "YTA, but don't worry about buying your own ticket. In fact, don't worry about spending any other holidays with your STBXGF or her family. Based on your attitude you won't be together much longer, if you even make it to the holidays. You have been together only 5 months. This is the weeding out phase, and your behavior is going to get you thrown from this garden!", "I'm kind of split between N-A-H and Y-T-A. And I think I'm settling on YTA.\n\nHer parents are right. They can't be expected to pay the airfare of someone they barely know, least of all if you're not even married to their daughter. For all they know, you won't even be together by this time next year. And you also have a right to decide not to go. An invitation is not a summons.\n\nOn the other hand, you're TA for expecting that they should pay for your ticket. That's some out-of-line entitlement, dude. When you get married, are you going to spring for the airfares of all your guests?\n\nAnd I also understand why they're buying the ticket for their son-in-law. He has made the commitment. By getting married, he's indicated that he intends to be in it for the long haul.", "Lol. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re single after that stupid demand.", "Lmao 5 months and you expect, or *demand* they pay for your ticket? Wow. YTA How entitled can you be?!

They are offering to host you and don\u2019t have any obligation to buy anything for you.", "Yta! I know people are asking for context but quite frankly NO ONE has to buy you a plane ticket. You\u2019ve only been dating their child for 5 months. Honestly you should be flattered they invited you to come at all. It was a kind offer to begin with. \n\nThe sheer amount of entitlement in your post is frightening. The fact that you believe you are on the same level as their SON IN LAW is breathtaking. You really believe you deserve the same treatment as a son in law and you haven\u2019t been around for six months?! \n\nI hope she dumps you. You are DEMANDING for $100s of dollars from people you don\u2019t know that well. I hope she sees you for the walking red flag you are. Grow up.", "5 months and you exoect a free literal ticket? Have you eber even met her parents? Or do you just expect great offerings for no reason from people you've never met on the regular?\n\nYTA", "NTA.\nBig time.\nThey're not disrespecting you.\nYou're just a boyfriend of only 5 months.\nExpect to be dumped, deservedly.", "YTA and you actually ARE demanding they pay, because your presence is contingent upon it. And if you acted like this after 5 months with my family, hoo boy your invited would be taken back real quick. As a guest, yeah, you pay your own way there, and THEN you get treated as a guest. You are not a family member they have to insure gets there. Get off your horse.", "There's context left out that determines the answer. Can you afford the ticket without it causing any problems in your ability to live the exact life you're living right now without sacrificing anything, including entertainment/fun and you just want these strangers to pay as some kind of supposed moral stance? Or, is paying for this plane ticket going to significantly impact you financially and cause things to change for you for a while with things being tight and sacrifices being made in your life to afford this trip? Also, where do you see this relationship going? If you see yourself possibly married to this girl someday as opposed to just dating and having fun and then moving on... Do you see how in the first scenario that YTA for expecting her parents to pony up a plane ticket for some rando who can afford to pay for himself while the second scenario is completely different?

Wow. If they offered to pay that would be nice, but I did not experience that type of treatment in any previous relationship after only 5 months. Try couple years.

Good advice would pay for your ticket to prove to your girlfriend and their family that youre are committed.", "YTA. \n\nHow entitled!!

You\u2019ve been together 5 months and BIL is MARRIED to SIL. You are not on the same level. You two could break up right after if they did that and what a waste of money. BIL is in it to win it and what comes after the holidays is no one\u2019s business because he locked it down already. You gave a silly reaction and she is right in how she feels about it. You are choosing a plane ticket over the holidays with her by demanding they pay for yours \u201cbeCauSE I\u2019m A gUesT\u201d. Grow up. Just say your broke and don\u2019t go.

They don't owe you anything. If you want to go and can afford it, go. If you don't or can't, don't go.\n\nActing like an entitled brat isn't endearing for most people and will only burn bridges.

Regardless if you can afford the ticket or not you shouldn\u2019t expect her parents to pay for your plane ticket especially only after 5 months of dating.

Flip the table, if your parents invited you and paid your way, would you expect them to pay for your Gf too? \n\nInstead of giving an ultimatum maybe you should find a way to compromise. One way would be, if you can\u2019t afford a plane ticket, which is understandable, you could suggest driving there and using the money your GF would\u2019ve received for her ticket towards gas.

My girlfriend's family who live in a small town invited us to join them for christmas this year.

We've been together for 5 months and I pretty much want to come BUT,, they're only going to pay for my girlfriend's ticket but not mine. I talked to my girlfriend and pointed out how they paid for her bil. she said it's 'different' since he's their son inlaw and that her parents aren't \"obligated\" to pay for me since they barely know me. I said it didn't matter how long they've known me, as a guest, I should recieve the same treatment as everybody else. I told her I won't come unless my ticket is paid for. period. She got mad and said it was weird for me to expect them to pay and that it was up to me to figure it out. I said cool then I'm not coming.\n\n\nShe's very upset with me saying I'm being ridiculous making a fuss over a plane ticket after her parents respected me enough to invite me to join their celebration.
