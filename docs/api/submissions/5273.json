Which is false, and Kate knows this from her memory. Two separate custody battles later, I finally established some time with the kiddo. On legal paper, too. Which tears my ex up. \n\nSo this week, I am to pick up Kate and start my parenting time for the holidays. My ex is claiming that since the weather will be bad on Thursday/Friday, that I need to push my parenting time to after x-mas in order for Kate to spend x-mas eve with my ex and their family. \n\nI do not agree with this as I have fought very hard and spent a lot of time and money to get to see Kate on a routine basis. Kate and I have been talking all week about how excited we are to see each other and spend time together. \n\nAccording to our court agreement, the law is that if I want to keep my parenting time, I am allowed to no matter what. So I told my ex \"no I will be picking Kate up as I normally would before the weather is supposed to get bad, and if the weather is bad on your patenting day, that is not my fault\". \n\nI got blasted and threatened by my ex that we are going back to court and that I am ridiculous for even trying to keep my parenting time, and I know this might seem obvious to some, but this is mentally exhausting for me and it triggers some serious PTSD (diagnosed), which has me all messed up on what's right morally and legally..\n\nAITA for not wanting to forfeit my parenting time, making it so that the weather could potentially hinder Kate from seeing her other parent on the holidays?", "created_utc": 1671600779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrbhqi/aita_for_refusing_to_change_my_custody_schedule/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Judges really really really do not like it when you do _anything_ that might put your child in unnecessary danger or stress, including traveling with them in your car when the roads may be unsafe. If a reasonable / average person might feel your roads are difficult to traverse, which I'm beginning to guess they might be, based on your other comment about the forecast there, you need to reconsider. Getting your time with your daughter is important. But not more important than your lives and it certainly not worth jeopardizing future time with her.

Being with Kate and knowing her -- especially at this age -- is the way to figure out what she wants and balance that with what is best.  \n\n\nI'm not an expert and my opinion isn't inherently worth more than anyone elses, but I wanted to make sure you had a different one in this thread in case you needed it.", "You are awesome.
