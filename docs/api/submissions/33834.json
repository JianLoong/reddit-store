I told him that I have an accent because my brain stores more information and that there\u2019s nothing in his. \n\nFinally I said that he should master his mother tongue before he comes to me. \n\nHe was shocked and told me to chill out.

The fact that he records you without your consent (another sign he might be attracted to you) is creepy and you should probably avoid him.

He probably didn\u2019t realize you were that annoyed by it. I also have 2 accents I can turn on or off depending on the situation, and when I was studying in the US, I got teased A LOT for it. But I\u2019ve always felt it was in good fun and didn\u2019t mind it. In fact, since my friend group included international students from a lot of different countries, teasing each other about our accents was so normal it became sorta an inside joke in our group. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s very context dependent and I probably wouldn\u2019t have taken the same teasing very well if it was with friends who weren\u2019t as close, or if it felt mean spirited. \n\nOverall, it sounds like he didn\u2019t realize how annoying you found it. Hopefully now he will stop. But if he continues, it would make him the A H", "NTA\n\nI would insult him even more if it happened to me.

You told him it\u2019s not, and he\u2019s confused", "NTA. \n\nHis behaviour sounds like the thing teen boys and emotionally immature young men do when they like a girl: they mock and ridicule them because they don\u2019t know how to tell her they like her, and/or they just think that the constant mockery will make her keen enough to chase after them and get their approval.", "Nope NTA. He needed to be sorted out.\n\nSounds like your brothers friend likes you and has no idea how to talk to you.

And if she had been clear from the start that she didn't like that, he might have understood and stopped earlier. It's not, however, an excuse to treat someone poorly.
