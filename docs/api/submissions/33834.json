He will mimic the way I say words or whole phrases. When I say something a bit wrong he will ask me to say it again just to rile me up. He even secretly records me sometimes when I\u2019m unaware and joked that he listens to the audio at night to help him fall asleep\u2026whatever that means!\n\nAnyway yesterday he once again teased my accent. I was fed up and hold him that he was raised speaking English, he only knows English and he will only ever speak English. I told him that I have an accent because my brain stores more information and that there\u2019s nothing in his. \n\nFinally I said that he should master his mother tongue before he comes to me. \n\nHe was shocked and told me to chill out. My brother laughed and made fun of him. \n\nSo he hasn\u2019t spoken to me since but texted a poorly written apology.

You did the right thing.", "He likes you and thinks he is gently teasing you out of affection.", "NTA, but it honestly just sounds like he has a crush on you.", "NTA.

Hopes he learns his lesson.", "Anyone who teases or polices another person for their language use is a pathetic, bullying jerk. NTA", "NTA.", "So many people are commenting \"he likes you so he's being mean to you\" like literally how is that still a thing in this day and age.. dude needs to be a better person, and as humans we need to eradicate that as a behaviour because ew", "NTA. He likes you though. Like massive crush but has the emotional intelligence of a 12 year old apparently.", "NTA. Sounds like the immature way of a male trying to flirt by insulting you. Like listening to audiotapes of you by night\u2026 you did nothing wrong", "NTA when some native speaker who only speaks his/her mother tongue makes comments about my accent, i tell I speak 4 languages, 3 on business/above level\u2026 the accent never caused an issue, and highlight that he/she should learn 3 more languages with perfect intonation before making comments about my accent.

He's a creep and doesn't know how to talk to women. You should be more concerned about him secretly recording you.", "NTA. He definitely has a crush, but he\u2019s a grown man and needs to grow the fuck up and learn to communicate properly.

This was a poor and creepy attempt at flirting on his part.", "NTA. He sounds like one of those pricks with the middle school ideology that you gotta bully someone you like to get their attention. Immature as fuck", "I think that I\u2019m his mind he\u2019s roasting/teasing you as a form of bonding as friends or flirting; this is completely benign in cases where you are already established friends - but if he\u2019s a friend of your brother he\u2019s definitely overstepping. The fact that he records you without your consent (another sign he might be attracted to you) is creepy and you should probably avoid him. You were absolutely in the right to respond the way you did, and you don\u2019t have to allow this person to be in your space in the future. NTA", "NTA. He was trying to flirt in the style of a 12 year old", "NTA. What a fucking weirdo", "NTA wasn't sure until I read other comments, but yeah this feels like the adult version of pulling pigtails.\n\nAccept the apology and keep an open mind. Everyone's some level of asshole, just most aren't malicious ones.", "lol. This is awesome. Great response bb.\n\nHe probably does like your accent, he probably likes you. But if he can\u2019t tell you don\u2019t like the way he teases you, then he gets to hear about himself and how dumb he is lol. Denis needs to grow up a little and stop trying to playground flirt with someone who isn\u2019t interested in it.\n\nJust tell him you don\u2019t like it when he does it and if he keeps teasing you then you will \u201ctease\u201d back. If he stops teasing/mocking you then won\u2019t need to shut him down.", "Absolutely NTA!! \n\nAs someone who only speaks English and lives in the UK I constantly feel a bit embarrassed when most people speak at least 2 languages! \n\nI would never make fun of someone's accent, pronunciation or grammar in English when it's their second (or third or whatever) language, only quietly and kindly correct something so they know for the future\n\nI always feel good when people come to me to check a word or email or their grammar or something because I might not be able to speak any other language but I can definitely teach you everything I know about English", "NTA. However I think for whatever reason he thinks that\u2019s a bonding thing between you and him.. I\u2019d sit him down and tell him it\u2019s not cool!", "INFO: Well, for me that depends, did you just silently take his mockery before or did you ever set a boundary? \n\nBlowing up at somebody when you never told them to stop would make me say ESH, but if you ever set a boundary and he ignored it, you're NTA.", "NAH. He probably didn\u2019t realize you were that annoyed by it. I also have 2 accents I can turn on or off depending on the situation, and when I was studying in the US, I got teased A LOT for it. But I\u2019ve always felt it was in good fun and didn\u2019t mind it. In fact, since my friend group included international students from a lot of different countries, teasing each other about our accents was so normal it became sorta an inside joke in our group. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s very context dependent and I probably wouldn\u2019t have taken the same teasing very well if it was with friends who weren\u2019t as close, or if it felt mean spirited. \n\nOverall, it sounds like he didn\u2019t realize how annoying you found it. Hopefully now he will stop. But if he continues, it would make him the A H", "NTA\n\nI would insult him even more if it happened to me. As someone who works overseas and has to speak another language, it's frustrating when they make you repeat something even if they understand it (there are some words only natives or people who lived there a long time can pronounce \"the right way\")\n\nHe is \"pulling pigtails\" He likes you and the only way to gain your attention it's to \"bully\" you. Sit him down and explain that is kid's behaviour. If you're interested in him, tell him to grow up if he wants a chance with you. If you arent, tell him that treating women with care and respect gain more points that teasing then all the time (a joke or two are great, but not what he did with the accent everytime... As I said, pretty much bullying)", "NTA\n\nBut as a side note, I think he likes you and by the apology quite a bit but dosn't know how to show it other than childish teasing", "Absolutely NTA! In my family, everyone is at least bilingual, I have some relatives who speak 5+ languages, the only people I\u2019ve seen make fun of someone\u2019s accent, or their level in a language have been monolinguals. Why doesn\u2019t your brother say something to that dude? I certainly wouldn\u2019t ever let one of my friends repeatedly make fun of my siblings like that", "NTA. and him recording you without your knowledge is soooo creepy", "NTA. Dude's madly in love/crushes hard on you and he's being a dumbass about it because he doesn't know any better. Doesn't mean you should be *nice* to him, because honestly that's some immature and dumb way of flirting, but I can really picture this", "He's still in that stupid childish phase where people say \"If a boy teases you, it means he likes you!\" NTA. Either he is simply a narrow minded idiot, or an idiot who thinks belittling women will get him laid.", "He clearly fancies you but doesn\u2019t know how to go about it and this was his (stupid) way of trying to get closer to you. Disagree with other posters, you have no obligation to be polite or gentle with someone you feel is disrespectful or derogatory towards you, whether they like you or not.

Good for you.  And do check and see if consent is required to record in your jurisdiction.  Either way, but especially if he was breaking the law, demand that all recordings of your voice be deleted from his phone.  I'm pretty sure you don't want this A listening to your voice while fiddling with himself and falling asleep.  Very creepy.\n\nNTA", "NTA dear gosh he reminds me of my mothers fiance\u00b4s brother-in-law. I know several languages too (to different degrees) and once he spent almost an entire hour teasing me for my accent. I know the frustration and you stayed within the line of civility. Its creepy that he recorded you without your knowledge or permission.", "NTA. Your response was what he needed.\n\nAnd, FWIW, coming from a multilingual background, I can 100% relate. Even though I know the right pronunciations, sometimes, especially when I'm switching between languages or if a word in a different language happens to pop up, it just comes out weirdly. \n\nFinally, given that you are asking the AITA question, you could let him know that everything's cool now.", "NTA you\u2019re pissed and you hit a wall. But know that he probably loves your accent", "NTA. Some people, for whatever reason, don't know they're being assholes until you call them out on it. It's just how some people grew up. They make fun of each other and that's how they show affection. It's stupid teenage boy shit but it's a fact of life. He apologised which is the reason I jump to that line of thinking. If he keeps doing it then he's just an asshole.", "NTA- sometimes people need to learn the hard way, and he had to learn that he was being rude. Intentionally or not. Now you can both relax and not feel awkward.", "NTA, dude has a crush on you and thought this was a good way to win you over. You told him it\u2019s not, and he\u2019s confused", "NTA. \n\nHis behaviour sounds like the thing teen boys and emotionally immature young men do when they like a girl: they mock and ridicule them because they don\u2019t know how to tell her they like her, and/or they just think that the constant mockery will make her keen enough to chase after them and get their approval.", "Nope NTA. He needed to be sorted out.\n\nSounds like your brothers friend likes you and has no idea how to talk to you. Some guys tease, not realising it\u2019s actually rude. \n\nAccept the apology and both of you can move on. 5 or 10 years from now he\u2019ll probably tell you he \u201cused to have a huge crush\u201d on you.", "NTA\n\nMy first thought was he was into you and was like those elementary school children who tease the people they like.", "NTA He might have thought he was being friendly or even flirty, but it sounds like he was being a dick.", "Nta i would have been harsher if it was me", "NTA.  You put him in his place and now he's apologising to you.\n\nObviously you are 100% right and he is 100% wrong.\n\nHowever, he has apologised and THAT says a lot about him too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is the same when you have a group of friends that like to make dark jokes and then meet a more \"sensible\" person, they may make the same kind of jokes without realising that it's not proper etiquette everywhere. And if she had been clear from the start that she didn't like that, he might have understood and stopped earlier. It's not, however, an excuse to treat someone poorly.
