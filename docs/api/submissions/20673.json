I have always had a good relationship with my sister (16F). Ever since I moved out of my parents' house at 18, she has always just been allowed to come over to hang out whenever she wants.\n\nOn Thursday, my lil sis just stops by to hang out per usual. We spent about 20 minutes catching up, just chatting about our lives. \n\nAfter that, my sis noticed that my fiance had one of the new playstation games that is part of a franchise she is really into. So her and my fiance got the game going and started both playing it on multiplayer.\n\nSo they were playing video games together and it came time to pick my daughter up from summer school. I got back to the apartment with my daughter and they were still playing the game. \n\nMy sister stayed over for a little longer. She helped me cook dinner and ate with us before going home.\n\nAfter she went home, my fiance said he needed to talk to me. He said he felt awkward saying anything when my sister was there but she was flirting with him while i was picking up our daughter. She said that it was \"hot\" how good he was at the game. She also made a comment that she wishes that he wasn't my fiance so she could kiss him. \n\nMy fiance said that the situation just made him very uncomfortable so he just sat there silently ignoring her comments.\n\nI called my sister confronting her about it. She said that my fiance was ok with the flirting since he didn't  do anything to try and stop it. I told her that her comments were very inappropriate and that she can't come over until she apologizes to my fiance for making him uncomfortable.\n\nShe did end up apologizing  to me for disrespecting my relationship. But I feel like my fiance needs a direct apology since he was the one who had creepy comments directed at him. My sister says she feels too weird to apologize to my fiance directly.\n\nI feel like I'm the asshole because I'm risking my whole relationship with my sister over something she has already apologized for. Is it too much asking for her to apologize to him as well?

If he would rather just drop it, then you should do what he asks, IMO.  He might be just as uncomfortable with the apology as he was with the flirting.\n\nThis only happened 4 days ago.  If he does want an apology, then I'd leave things as they are for a while at least.  This was a major breach of trust and she really shouldn't be allowed to just forget about it in 4 days.", "NTA \n\nYour sister does not seem to understand consent or what is appropriate behavior. \n\nIf she\u2019s never acted out like this before with inappropriate sexual advances you may want to look a little deeper to ensure nothing is going on in her life that\u2019s cause for concern.", "NTA\n\nThat's pretty creepy.  I really wouldn't want her hanging around after hearing all that.  She's a minor, hitting on a man who is taken and 8 years older.  That's pretty ballsy and also kind of scary for your fiance.  I can see why he's uncomfortable.  \n\nShe owes him the apology, not you.  If she didn't feel weird making the comments, she has no reason to feel weird apologizing for them.  \n\n\n>my fiance was ok with the flirting since he didn't do anything to try and stop it.\n\nAlso, silence is not an indication of consent.  You need to make sure she knows that much.", "NTA. She was in your home flirting with your fianc\u00e9. Setting boundaries and rules for what constitutes acceptable behavior in your home is completely appropriate, especially when it comes to minors flirting with your adult fianc\u00e9. \n\nUltimately, you should talk with your fianc\u00e9 and find out his stance on the situation and work out together how to proceed. He was the one made to feel especially uncomfortable and it is his home too. \n\nAlso, \u201cit\u2019s too weird\u201d is a horrible reason not to apologize. It was probably extremely weird for your fianc\u00e9 to be hit on by someone he likely views as a little sister, or is at the very least his soon to be in-law who is also a minor. \n\nYour sister is the one who put the relationship at risk by hitting on your partner. You are not the one putting it at risk for trying to establish boundaries that should have been implied anyways", "INFO: Have you spoken to your fiance about the apology and if he wants one? An apologize may be awkward for him too. He didn't address the issue with her and instead talked to you. So maybe he just wants you to address it and forget it happened.", "> Is it too much asking for her to apologize to him as well?\n\nDoes your fiance want an apology? I think it's up to him really", "Not only are you NTA, but your sister should be ashamed. 16 or not, what was she gonna do if you fiance was receptive? Start an affair behind your back? \n\nThank god your fiance is a normal person, because this could have gone real bad, real quick.", "NTA. But I think your fianc\u00e9 needs to answer this question. I can see where this would be horribly embarrassing for her and might make him feel even more uncomfortable.", "NTA -but like everyone else. you need to discuss with your fiance what he wants as far as an apology and what would make him comfortable with her being there. I doubt he is going to be comfortable being alone with her any time in the near future.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA, but your fianc\u00e9 needs to take the lead here. If he wants an apology fine. If I were in his shoes, I would not want to be alone with your sister ever again. Especially not while she is still a minor. \n\nSister needs to learn some boundaries and back off. What a terrible thing to do to both of you.", "That's all you did? Ask for an apology.  That was a major breach of trust.  Going after your sister's fiance. And what if he had taken her up on her offer? And you're worried about ruining your relationship with your sister?  She could have totally nuked yours. What if your sister did this with someone who took her up on her offer? There are a lot of creeps out there. Did you tell your parents what she did? She needs more than a half-assed apology to you with no apology to your fiance because it would be weird than getting a tap on the wrist.  YTA to your fiance.", "NTA. She didn't feel weird when she was flirting with her BIL but she does feel weird when she has to apologize?\nThat's double standards. Also you should watch out for her actions and restrict her visits, she is a 16 y/o, she should know the depth and consequences of her actions.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t flirting, it was sexual harassment", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s behavior is gross and disrespectful. \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA, she needs to take responsibility of her hormones if they make people uncomfortable.  That said, the proper way to do this is for your fiance to call her up and explain his feelings, not use you as a middle man, or at least have the speaker phone on.  Then she can apologize to him directly, which will be easier if she's put on the spot to do so.  If you fiance isn't willing to ask for the apology directly, then he should let it go.  And honestly, he should have been comfortable putting it down at the moment, but understandable if he was in too much shock. \n\nEveryone can learn from this.", "Without knowing what your fiance wants it is hard to say if Y T A.

It's great that your sister apologized to you for disrespecting the relationship, but you're forcing the issue on something that he might not want.

That\u2019s not even an apology worth receiving. But honestly the disrespect for your relationship is much more important here than the fact that she made your fianc\u00e9 uncomfortable.

She needs to understand that she was crossing boundaries, and making your fianc\u00e9 uncomfortable.

If she doesn't apologize, she's liable to push that same boundary again.  Making her apologize is simply being called to account for her (totally inappropriate) actions.

Watch your back.", "NTA, but you need to nip this in the bud and be proactive about protecting your SO.\n\nYour sister acted inappropriately and showed a significant integrity / trust violation.  If she feels vindictive now, she may later accuse him of making a pass at her (or worse).\n\nShe should not, under any circumstances, be alone with him for a very VERY long time.  (Do not think \"days\" or \"weeks\"; think in terms of \"months\" or \"years\").\n\nPlease do not downplay her actions - teens of that age are still developing emotionally and may not think through repercussions of their actions when she wants to \"get even\".   She is embarrassed now and will carry that for some time.  She may blame your SO for telling you (which shows significant integrity on his part!) and be angry with him as well as you.\n\nAn accusation, even if completely unfounded, could lead to your SO's arrest and could cost thousands of dollars in legal fees to address.\n\nEDIT TO ADD -- Consider a sit-down conversation with you, your SO and your sister.  Up to you whether or not to involve the parents.  Your SO needs to take the lead to say that her actions were absolutely inappropriate, the cannot ever be repeated and that any similar action will result in her not being able to visit in your home AT ALL.  She needs to see that you both take this seriously and it is an infraction that could end her relationship with both of you.  During this conversation, you can explore whether there is anything else going on that is sexualizing her, or is it just teenage hormones.", "NTA - but I wouldn't let your sister be alone with the fianc\u00e9 anymore.

My man was imagining a slideshow of getting beaten to death in a prison somewhere.", "This, this, this. Your sister could totally frack up his life with her teenage hormones. All it would take is her making an accusation because her feelings got hurt. Do your fianc\u00e9 a solid and never leave her alone with him while she\u2019s a minor.
