She is objectifying him and she\u2019s only sorry for trying to play with *your* possession.\n\nThe truth is, she harassed your fianc\u00e9.  She feels weird about apologizing to him because she doesn\u2019t see him as a human with his own individual feelings.  And for her to apologize to him directly is to admit accountability that she made another HUMAN with feelings feel uncomfortable.\n\nHad your fianc\u00e9 friends done the same thing to you and only apologized to your fianc\u00e9 for trying to make a move on you\u2026. Wouldn\u2019t you feel insulted that they wouldn\u2019t even apologize to you when you\u2019re the victim of their harassment?  Most likely.  So why are you willing to risk your relationship with your fianc\u00e9 in order to baby your sister from facing the responsibilities of her actions?", "Most NTA I\u2019ve ever seen.", "NTA. Your sister should be embarrassed, and feeling weird about this is a good thing. She needs to apologize to him, and she needs to never be permitted to be around him alone until you are really convinced that this will not happen again. Her behavior puts him in an incredibly precarious spot.", "NTA! But frankly, there are some major issues you need to address beyond an apology before she would be in your home.\n\nFirst, she is a minor and made advances on your fianc\u00e9. If she falsely accused him of something he could go to jail and at a minimum it will absolutely ruin his life.\n\nSecond, you both need to decide the terms of if she will be allowed to visit again. He was harassed by your sister and is clearly uncomfortable being around her. You should not allow her into your home even if she actually apologizes unless he agrees.\n\nThirdly, you need to discuss this with your parents. It is a major red flag and I would be worried something else is going on in her life. Your parents need to be aware and nip this in the bud before things escalate.", "NTA and I would make it a point to not let her be alone with him ever again. She goes when you go, and she comes over only when it's convenient for your fiance.\n\nYou love your sister, but this is weird behavior even for a 16 year old. You have your own family now and they are your priority. You need to involve your parents in this; they need to parent this, not you.", "She's not sorry she flirted with him. She's sorry she got caught because your fiance ratted her out to you.\n\nNTA", "NTA, for your fianc\u00e9's sake don't bring him to a situation where he has to be alone with her.", "OP, I would set boundaries instead of asking for an apology. She should never be alone with your fiance moving forward, which also means that she can no longer just stop by. She can have planned visits when you're there, and that's it.\n\nIf you trust your parent, I'd also let them know what happened and ask them to talk to her. Her behavior is unusual...\n\nThe last thing you want is for your fiance to be accursed of something...", "I suspect he didn't want to be open to accusations from her", "I agree.\nDon't force an apology. Ban her from the house without prior invitation.", "Girls will be girls, right?\n\n/S", "Probably because he was worried about her reaction if he rejected her and made a big deal out of it.\n\nHe was incredibly vulnerable to an accusation.", "The apology isn't the issue.\nHer behaviour is.\n\nIf I was the fiance, she would not be darkening the door again uninvited.", "Shouldn't the fiance get to decide.\nSince he was the one she harassed and all.", "I forgot she was 16 lol, still, I would not want her back", "\nI don't know why you all insist on the issue of apology\nEven if the sister apologized, does this mean that they will forget what happened?\nHaven't you ever seen anyone apologize while he is not sincere in his apology? It's easy", "If I were the fianc\u00e9, honestly, I would be reconsidering the engagement. This situation would freak me out too much.", "Dude, with how quick that situation can go from 0 to 'my life is ruined', I would make sure that was the last time I was alone with my fiance's sister again.", "guess what. you don't have to be evil to sexually harass someone. normal everyday okay stupid people can do shitty asshole things. they can even feel embarrassed about it afterwards.\n\nthat doesn't negate the fact that they were assholes. doesn't absolve them of responsibility. doesn't make it less than what it is - which *is* harassment, regardless of her age.\n\nthe kid *should* be embarrassed. but her embarrassment isn't more than the discomfort and grossness she made the fiance feel.", "Honestly, that would freak me out so much, I might reconsider the engagement. It might be an overreaction on my part, but if this happened once it is arguably likely to happen again and she is still a minor. This could absolutely ruin his life."]}
