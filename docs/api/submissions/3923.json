We share the same father, but have different mums. My father has never been in my life, and all I really know about him is that he has a ton of children with a ton of different women. Just a hit and run type of guy. \n\nBy the time I had reached middle school, I had fully accepted the fact that I will never know my father or any of my half siblings, and the thought rarely ever crossed my mind, that is up until about a month ago, when one of my half brothers reached out to me via social media. He told me he had been searching for me for awhile, after finding out about me after contacting our father. We started talking and the conversations sort of just took off from there. He asked me if I would like to meet up for lunch sometime, and I agreed so we set up a time and place. I let my mum know of this new door being opened in my life, and she told me that this is a journey I have to walk on my own, as it is about my dad and half-siblings and not hers. I agreed and continued on to meet my half brother for coffee by myself. After I came home from meeting my brother, my mum asked me how it went. I told her it was good and could definitely see us becoming friends.\n\nThis is where our argument sort of began. She told me I should invite my half brother over for dinner and to some of our family events. I told her I wasn\u2019t going to do that because we had just met for the first time and I wanted to take things slow, as this chapter is new thing for me and I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about it yet. She said she understood and left it at that or so I thought until today, 2 hours ago, when she came home and told me that she had invited my half brother over for dinner tomorrow night. I asked her how she found him and she told me she searched through my followers until she found him and sent a message, to which he replied and said okay. This is where I started to get angry, yelling at her asking why she would do that after I had just told her a few days ago that I wanted to take things slow before fully inviting him into our lives. She just replied that she wanted to meet him, that she knew I wasn\u2019t going to invite him so she did it herself, and that it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I told her that him coming over for dinner might not be a big deal to her, but she wouldn\u2019t understand what it is like for me because she has always had her dad and siblings in her life. She got upset and started to cry, calling me an asshole for being rude, \u201cusing my dad as an excuse\u201d and that I need to stop being so selfish. I keep getting texts from my family telling me that there was no need to lash out like that and I should apologize, but I don\u2019t feel like I am in the wrong.\n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want my half brother to come over for dinner - I\u2019m mad that my mum disregarded our entire conversation we had a few days previously, where I told her I didn\u2019t want to invite him over for dinner yet because I wanted to take things slow and she went behind my back and did it anyways, even after telling me \u201cthis is your journey\u201d\n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1670138847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc3hkw/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_mum_for_inviting_my/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would be pissed too", "NTA. Less about her inviting him and more about how she invaded your privacy", "NTA. Your mum going through your followers list is creepy, and completely disregarding the conversation she had with you, then citing that \"it wasn't a big deal\" is A-hole behaviour.\n\nIn other words, she crossed the fine line, and couldn't respect your privacy.", "NTA, your mom needs to learn boundaries", "NTA, your mom is 100% in the wrong, she decided that what she wants is the only thing that matters and since it's not a big deal to her it can't be a big deal to you (the world revolves around her I guess?). The crying sounds manipulative, she was way out of line in calling you a rude asshole and then more manipulative in crying to family to get their support and sympathy against you.\n\nNot a person you can trust.", "NTA. 1) she disregarded your wishes 2) she invaded your privacy and 3) he isn't related to her, he's related to you. It's up to you on how you want to navigate the relationship with YOUR brother. Her calling you selfish because you expressed how upset you are and why is ridiculous. It's not like you are keeping her long lost son from her. She seems to be more concerned about assuaging her curiosity over one of the children her ex sired with someone else than respecting your wishes. Furthermore, what if the invite had made him uncomfortable. He sought out his sister, not his sister's  mom.", "Nta. Her saying for you to stop being selfish is really odd when she invited him for herself & her own reasons. 'I wanted to meet him' is not good enough. Wanting him invited to family events? Hes not her family & your family is not his family. Youre his family & you're building a relationship that works for you both. She'd no right to interfere.  Im in a similar situation of knowing I've half siblings out there... id feel weird them being invited into my world by someone else rather than at my pace. Say there was a mix up & uninvite your brother but make another plan with him. Teach mum some boundaries.", "NTA.  Your mom clearly has an issue with boundaries, and this was a big one.", "NTA. And it\u2019s a big deal. Ask your half brother not to come and go for a burger or whatever with him.", "NTA.  Your mom apparently has very, very poor boundaries and a lack of respect for your wishes or your privacy.  Your intrusive mom is the one who was selfish, not you! Immediately contact your half-brother and ask him to meet you at a restaurant instead.  You can let him know that you really want to get to know him without involving your mom, who's having a wee problem with respecting your privacy.  In fact, this is your journey.  Also your life.  You're an adult now, don't feel guilty when you don't allow another adult to walk all over you because she wants what she wants what she wants when she wants it. (Also, it's time to password protect all of your devices with passwords that can't be guessed,  and to make your contacts private wherever you can.  And not because of hackers.)", "NTA \n\nShe crossed a boundary. You need to change the privacy settings on your social media. Set it so she nor anybody else can see your friend list. You can also restrict or block her. You are 18, and she does not need to be monitoring your social media accounts anymore. Also, change your passwords on all accounts including email.", "Why did the mum suddenly do such an about-face on it? That\u2019s odd, she went from saying it\u2019s a journey OP needs to take alone, to majorly interfering? \n\nNTA, but I\u2019d try and have a calm conversation with your mum about why she suddenly felt so differently about the whole thing? Does she feel worried and want to meet him? Does she want to support you now and make you feel like your other family is welcome with her? Whatever the reason clearly she\u2019s going about this very badly\u2026", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom is an AH for guintoing you, she is manipulative and boundary stomping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut this is easy: Tell her you will not be there when she has dinner with him. SHE can do whatever she likes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut YOU are fine to meet him at your speed, or never at all. YOUR choice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do not let your mother railroad you into doing something you specifically told her you did not want to do.", "Nta.\n\nShe said walk this journey alone and then went full into it by trawling your social media and going against your wishes.

Reminds me a bit of when my older half brother tracked down my Dad online via his sister (my aunt) after 40-odd years, and my aunt was trying to get him to visit HER first rather than us (his Dad and half-siblings!).\n\nOP this is all still very new for you, and while I'd like to think your mother is just enthusiastic for you, she is absolutely crossing a line and seems to be attempting to claw back some kind of control over the situation?\n\nI hope all continues to go well with your brother, but I think you should perhaps also talk with him about this to see how he feels - he might have felt pressured into agreeing and also thinks it's a bit much so soon! You should be allowed to get to know each other one-on-one without interference.", "NTA - Take out the emotional family details and it\u2019s simple. She suggested a thing.

I would actually be honest with your half brother. Tell him you are very sorry but your mum invited him behind your back when you told her you weren't ready to introduce her yet. You love her but she would not recognise a boundary if it smacked her in the face. Can he please skip dinner tomorrow as you are not ready to do family introductions yet.

She 'knows better,' and when you disagreed with that she turned quickly to emotional manipulation and gaslighting.

You went into my FB and acted like a creep.\n\nYou even said he's no relation to you only me and you go and do this. \n\nDO NOT expect me to be so honest and open with you after this. \nI don't trust you and don't be surprised if I go NC with you.\n\nIt's all about you and your wants, you don't care about anyone but yourself."]}
