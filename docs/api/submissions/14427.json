We've been together for around 6 years now and got the home when 4.\n\nWe're very comfortable being around with each other. We would go around the house in our underwear or even naked sometimes. It's been this way for as long as I can remember.\n\n...\n\nRecently, on a weekday, I went to fetch her home from work. We reached home and did our usual stuff. I then had a phone call, and needed to work on some project with my family (important).\n\nI went over to my girlfriend room, and asked and borrowed her phone. She didn't really wanted to lend me but did it anyway because it has an app installed which I needed. (She knew I needed it for work)\n*And to clarify, I could had install the app myself but I was already tired after working all day, and now at night, I decided to borrow hers.\n\nI went back to my room and started working. At that time, my girlfriend is already topless. I was on the mic working and talking and then needed to show the phone screen. I stand up and told them to wait as I setup the camera, and I closed my door.\n\nI had the camera on. And continued working. I was so focused that I didn't notice my girlfriend opened the door and was coming in, until I heard my sister scream. \n\nThings happened so fast. My girl was exposed and she quickly hid herself (was around 5 seconds). I was in shocked and asked why is she in my room. She said she wanted to get her phone back. I was still in shock and didn't immediately end the call until a minute or so.\n\nThe night was very long. I was trying to comfort her. \nShe cried and wanted to be alone. I insisted to stay beside her, but she cried harder and asked me to go away. In the end I complied.\n\n...\n\nThe next day morning, I offered to fetch her to work, she declined. I offered to fetch her back from work, she declined.\n\nThe next day, I bought some snacks for her. Tidy up her room, wrote some notes and left it in the fridge and her room. She finished work and came back. I thought she didn't notice the notes, and texted her about it. She told me the snacks were too sweet and she can't eat them. (She usually takes one bite if that's the case)\n\nThe next day, I tried approach her again to talk, she told me she's not ready to talk to me.\n\n...\n\nThings continue on (for a few days). I felt like we're strangers now. She's been avoiding me and doesn't want to talk to me. It felt intense for me because she's living in the room next to me. \n\nI confronted her and told her she's hurting me by doing so. She said I'm insensitive to confront her while she's going through this.\n\n...\n\nNow, I do admit i can't fully understand it because I'm not her. I'm not female too. \n\nBut what about me and my feelings?\n\nAm I insensitive? Please tell me if I am. Because I don't understand how serious this is.\n\n*My sister told me it's around 5 seconds. My brother was present.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nContext Update:\n- That was the first time, in our relationship, I borrowed her phone for work.\n- It was the first time I needed that app (We Chat browser).\n- The work I'm doing is website related.\n- I failed to inform my gf about the video call. I closed my door instead.\n- I attended to the issue because it was urgent, without having dinner. \n- I didnt had dinner that night.\n  \nMore Context Update:\n- The call started with voice only. She knew I was on voice call. But in the middle, it became video call. She wasn't aware of it. \n- We also dont usually knock the door. The reason we lived in seperate rooms, is because the rooms are small. We enter each other rooms as we like.\n- Usually when one of us close the door, is because we turned on A/C.\n\n\nFINAL UPDATE: ITA\n- I finally understand what I did wrong. Thanks to you guys. \n- The problem stems from my laziness. Although the borrowing phone was a one time thing, the laziness is not.\n- She had put up with my lazyness for as long as I can remember. \n- This time, it had an unrecoverable consequences. \n  \nI appreciate all the comments, both YTA and NTA. The purpose of the post was to find out my fault. \n\n_To all those trying to shift the blame to my girl, you seriously think that's gonna make anybody feel better except yourself?_", "created_utc": 1681093955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h4b2p/aita_for_accidentally_exposing_my_girlfriend/", "score": 509, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously for taking your girlfriend's phone when she didn't want you to use it and for not warning her you were on a video call.

My husband and I will rotate your phones often and I don't see a problem there)\n\nAnd what did die thought you needed her phone for?

But hopefully you've figured that out by now.", "I'm not taking the \"you're the guy so you suck\" bandwagon and gonna say NTA. She walked into your room, without knocking, with her shirt off. That isn't your fault. She exposed herself because she didn't knock and chose to walk in without her shirt on while you were on a video call in your own room. The fact that you were using her phone is irrelevant because she should have knocked first. The door closed means knock. \n\nAnd now she's treating you like a stranger for something that isn't your fault. If she's a victim, then she's a victim of her own making, and her making you pay for it is an AH thing to do. Your feelings are valid, too, and anyone who thinks otherwise is just misandric.\n\nEDIT: Let me spell it out. Yes, they share a house.

It's unusual for the same person that is comfortable being nude at home around their partner to be so bothered by this.\n\nIt's immature and unhealthy to still not be talking to you the next morning and keep it up for days. If you sort it out, you should try to agree not to do that again and deal with problems properly.", "I may the only one here that says YNTA... or... YBTA. Maybe because I can relate to your girl a bit here, having been raised in a conservative family, myself.\n\nIn a conservative family, we knock. We always knock if the door is closed. That keeps everyone's private bits private.\n\nWhile I would have TOTALLY understood her upset over this if YOU had been the one to walk in with the camera while she was nude, I don't get it with the roles reversed here. She knew she was nude, and she barged in without knocking, and got mad at you because of... what? Because you didn't predict she would come in the door naked without knocking?\n\nComing from a conservative home is no excuse for this, because that means she KNOWS to knock, even if YOU don't. She knew you were in there with the phone. She couldn't figure out that a closed door + having her phone MIGHT mean she needs to cover up or knock prior to coming in?\n\nAnd the days of stonewalling is actually considered a classic abuser move to punish you into submission. If you don't believe me, just do some reading on intimate partner abuse. It's usually pretty high on their lists of example behaviors that make up abuse. Accusing you of abuse just by trying to talk to her about it... also a classic abuser move.\n\nJust FYI, I have a definitely disturbed aunt that has disowned one of my cousins because he walked in on her by accident. He didn't do anything to her at all, didn't say anything, immediately left and everything. But for her, just the fact he walked in on her is all that matters... no matter how accidental or how quickly he backed himself out. That is how she has ALWAYS operated: it's all about her, forget everyone else. The things she did to my grandma at the end of her life were absolutely atrocious. \n\nIf this is an ongoing pattern of behavior with your GF, I highly recommend you get away from her, no matter how perfect and flawless she may seem to be or how worthless she makes you feel about yourself. People who are like that can be literally DEADLY to you. \n\nAs for you... the most I can say you could've done differently is said something before you shut the door.

Also crying for days after and not being willing to communicate with her partner is immature. Also the giving him a hard time about the phone is weird too.
