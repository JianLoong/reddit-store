We've been together for around 6 years now and got the home when 4.\n\nWe're very comfortable being around with each other. We would go around the house in our underwear or even naked sometimes. It's been this way for as long as I can remember.\n\n...\n\nRecently, on a weekday, I went to fetch her home from work. We reached home and did our usual stuff. I then had a phone call, and needed to work on some project with my family (important).\n\nI went over to my girlfriend room, and asked and borrowed her phone. She didn't really wanted to lend me but did it anyway because it has an app installed which I needed. (She knew I needed it for work)\n*And to clarify, I could had install the app myself but I was already tired after working all day, and now at night, I decided to borrow hers.\n\nI went back to my room and started working. At that time, my girlfriend is already topless. I was on the mic working and talking and then needed to show the phone screen. I stand up and told them to wait as I setup the camera, and I closed my door.\n\nI had the camera on. And continued working. I was so focused that I didn't notice my girlfriend opened the door and was coming in, until I heard my sister scream. \n\nThings happened so fast. My girl was exposed and she quickly hid herself (was around 5 seconds). I was in shocked and asked why is she in my room. She said she wanted to get her phone back. I was still in shock and didn't immediately end the call until a minute or so.\n\nThe night was very long. I was trying to comfort her. \nShe cried and wanted to be alone. I insisted to stay beside her, but she cried harder and asked me to go away. In the end I complied.\n\n...\n\nThe next day morning, I offered to fetch her to work, she declined. I offered to fetch her back from work, she declined.\n\nThe next day, I bought some snacks for her. Tidy up her room, wrote some notes and left it in the fridge and her room. She finished work and came back. I thought she didn't notice the notes, and texted her about it. She told me the snacks were too sweet and she can't eat them. (She usually takes one bite if that's the case)\n\nThe next day, I tried approach her again to talk, she told me she's not ready to talk to me.\n\n...\n\nThings continue on (for a few days). I felt like we're strangers now. She's been avoiding me and doesn't want to talk to me. It felt intense for me because she's living in the room next to me. \n\nI confronted her and told her she's hurting me by doing so. She said I'm insensitive to confront her while she's going through this.\n\n...\n\nNow, I do admit i can't fully understand it because I'm not her. I'm not female too. \n\nBut what about me and my feelings?\n\nAm I insensitive? Please tell me if I am. Because I don't understand how serious this is.\n\n*My sister told me it's around 5 seconds. My brother was present.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nContext Update:\n- That was the first time, in our relationship, I borrowed her phone for work.\n- It was the first time I needed that app (We Chat browser).\n- The work I'm doing is website related.\n- I failed to inform my gf about the video call. I closed my door instead.\n- I attended to the issue because it was urgent, without having dinner. \n- I didnt had dinner that night.\n  \nMore Context Update:\n- The call started with voice only. She knew I was on voice call. But in the middle, it became video call. She wasn't aware of it. \n- We also dont usually knock the door. The reason we lived in seperate rooms, is because the rooms are small. We enter each other rooms as we like.\n- Usually when one of us close the door, is because we turned on A/C.", "created_utc": 1681093955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12h4b2p/aita_for_accidentally_exposing_my_girlfriend/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That isn't your fault. She exposed herself because she didn't knock and chose to walk in without her shirt on while you were on a video call in your own room. The fact that you were using her phone is irrelevant because she should have knocked first. The door closed means knock. \n\nAnd now she's treating you like a stranger for something that isn't your fault. If she's a victim, then she's a victim of her own making, and her making you pay for it is an AH thing to do.

It was urgent because the link was sent to client through we chat. And they opened and saw blank page.", "We have separate rooms. And we sleep separately.", "Some families aren't as relaxed as that. My family, who is pretty traditional and conventional, would see this a big deal as well if I accidentally expose my partner's private bits. OP's family is probably a bit like that as well and why this sounded like a big deal for the GF and the siblings (his sister screamed LOL). I agree with you that female breasts shouldn't be a big deal but for a lot of people they are still.", "OP took her phone", ">I'm not taking the \"you're the guy so you suck\" bandwagon\n\nAll YTA ratings I saw had very good arguments for this judgement nothing to do with gender. You making it about gender seems like *you* are the one seeing this as a \"men against women\" kind of thing and like you are the one biased against women. Stop projecting", "[deleted]", "Sounds a lot like victim blaming here. If we are talking about entitlement let\u2019s talk about how he felt entitled to her phone? \n\nAlso no one is on a bandwagon here. He\u2019s the asshole because he\u2019s being a self centred insensitive jerk and refusing to even try and empathise. His gender has nothing to do with it. If anything, he\u2019s using his gender to try and excuse himself of any blames How dare you say she is a victim of her own making? How is she at fault in any way here?\n\nOP exposed himself as incapable of empathy or respecting of privacy and you\u2019re blaming her?", "We dont usually knock. The reason we stayed in separate rooms is because the rooms are too small. (I had updated the context in post)   \n\n\nShe's 100% a victim, and it's not her fault. My problem is I felt I'm one too.   \n\n\nAnd as others pointed out, I wasn't able to fully empathize her situation.", "I\u2019ll get downvoted but I agree w you 100%.. why didn\u2019t she poke her head it first before she came in topless? And did she not hear him/them talking before she barged in?  \n\nLike I get that he had her phone and all but a quick knock on the door from would\u2019ve solved this I think tbh", "Fr, he asked to borrow the phone and she allowed it. She probably had no idea that he would video chat anyone so it\u2019s kinda on her.", "Thanks. I do hope we can laugh about it in future.", "His family shouldn\u2019t be seeing her naked, she has a right to be pissed bc he said he was working not video chatting family. \n\nThis all could\u2019ve been avoided if he wasn\u2019t so lazy to download the app on his own phone and let her keep her own phone. \ud83d\ude44", "When I confronted her, she said, when she saw me, she's reminded of the incident. That's why she avoid me. \n\nBut I don't know how to resolve this if we continue living like strangers in the same roof.", "Are you saying this because you're also female and experienced this before?", "She's sad and depressed. I don't think she fully understand why either. And that's actually what I want to find out by posting the incident here.  \n\n\nEdit: 100% My fault on not installing the App.", "Thanks. And I'll do that.", "You just started to blatantly assume stuff to support your narrative lmao. At what point does it say he harassed her. He simply asked and she obliged. He never says it\u2019s her fault he is taking the full blame multiple times and trying to make it up to her. He didn\u2019t expose her, she did. His door was closed in HIS bedroom. A knock from the gf would have sufficed. NTA", "Thanks for your words.", "Taking my phone when yours is available you\u2019re just being lazy would be a total dealbreaker in and of itself.", "you're a shitty bf and i hope she leaves :) YTA. stop taking her stuff bc you're too lazy to do what you need to for YOUR work.", "Yta just in case you didn't figure that out. You're not a good person.", "What type of custom web browser", "I'm a woman. I would feel humiliated if my boyfriend's family saw me like that. Breasts are something that are very personal to women, especially becaise we're expected to keep them covered most of the time. She is probably afraid that your brother and sister will always be able to remember seeing her like that and she doesn't want anyone but you to see her like that. You need to back off and let her be upset for a while. I know you want her to be okay and for things to go back to normal. But she's going to need some time. And for you to refuse to give her that will not make her want to be close with you again. Imagine if you walked in without pants on in front of her family. You'd feel upset and embarrassed too.", "I get you\u2019re not a woman but you are capable of human empathy right? I don\u2019t think you are unable to understand why you\u2019re in the wrong or how bad it was. I think you know perfectly well just how horrible she feels, but you\u2019re much too wrapped up in your own emotions to actually care", "That's a reasonable explanation of why you had it but YTA for taking her phone when she didn't really want to give it when you could have installed it yourself. Your a web developer, I'd imagine you have all sorts of browsers installed on your phone. Being too tired to install another one is bullshit. You weren't too tired to actually debug the app, which is a infinitely more strenuous task There is absolutely no way you were too tired to install an app, but had enough energy to debug a website. Stop kidding yourself.", "No mental gymnastics is needed. You just don't like my response, and you don't need to. Your response brings up unrelated facts to him being ignored and called insensitive for not liking being ignored. You're free not to comment if you're just going to insult.", "If you read the post it said that he was working on something with his family.", "[deleted]", "I am female and would definitely not have my knickers in a twist over my inlaws seeing my breasts by accident. \n\nAnd why was your sister screaming? She\u2019s an asshole for doing that.", "Well you ain't gonna find out why she is sad and depressed here. All you're gonna get are mixed messages. The body positive free spirits will say it was an honest mistake and the prudes are gonna say you deserve to be hung. \n\nHopefully you've downloaded the app!", "It takes less effort and energy to download an app than it does to get up and go to another room and get her phone", "We chat", "Thanks for your words. If you may, I would like to know more about what does space mean?  \n\n\nI am not sure if I should do nothing. But when I did something (in the post), she rejected. Am I not giving her space? It's much easier for me to do nothing as I wont get hurt too.", "From what my sister told me, it's only her and my brother who saw.", "It takes more effort and energy to purchase a home together than downloading an app. I don't get OP at all \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So not completely custom... As you can download 8t in the app store. \n\n You could of just downloaded this.  Instead of taking her phone. \n\nOr is there another reason you wanted her phone?", "WeChat takes no time to download and what kind of work are you doing exactly that needs a chat app that serves chiefly Chinese market? Are you drop-shipping or something?\n\nYours or your families' \"job\" sounds pretty suss.", "Right now, you need to just take a step back and let her feel what she's feeling. Rather than keep apologizing and doing things for her, leave her be. She knows you're sorry. You can tell her that when she's ready to talk, you'll be there. She most likely won't be distancing herself forever.", "Listen to her. She asked for space and you \"insisted\" that you stay with her. You invaded her privacy and her space once already- in a big way by exposing her to people she did not and probably would not consent to. \n\nStop trying to do things. She is telling you what she needs. LISTEN TO HER!\n\nThis isn't about you. It's because of you.", "Space specifically means leave her alone. No contact until she contacts you", "Yes you are right. I could had downloaded the app myself. If I wanted to say the reason, I was tired and didn't want to go through the hassle.\n\nMore context, I developed a website for my family and it broke only when opened inside we chat browser.", "Next time go through the hassle and leave your girlfriends belongings alone, she wouldn\u2019t have gone in you room if you didn\u2019t have her phone, and she wouldn\u2019t have gone in your room if she knew you were on video call. \n\nYou inconvenienced her, not the other way around.", "Lazy", "You should  have just installed the app dude.", "Yes. I'll do that next time. For more context, I did apologize and I blame myself for the whole incident. I could had told her, could had locked the door, could had downloaded the app. You name it.\n\nBut she's been avoiding me. And I afraid there might not be a next time.", "Well you did make her hurt feelings all about you, also why did your sister scream so loud at your girlfriend being topless? That probably added to the humiliation tbh. \n\nAlso, your girlfriend is possibly wondering how she can show her face to your family again after not just one - but two people seen her in a vulnerable state of undress. How would you feel if your girlfriends family accidentally seen your penis for the same amount of time?", "Who else would you blame?", "That's the problem. I don't understand and don't think I can. I can't say it wasn't embarrassing. But it won't become a reason for me to isolate my girl."]}
