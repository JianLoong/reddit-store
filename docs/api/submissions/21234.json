You've told him that it bothers you and he continues to do it. Honestly, that's a red flag. Please don't marry him til you guys get some relationship counseling.

Bonus points for shouting loudly that you know he's sleeping with your sister.", "NTA. Like you said, it was funny the first time but now the joke has soured.\n\nNormally I wouldn't say this but it's not a good sign that he's doing something you hate, refusing to stop, and his family is trying to pressure you into agreeing.

At this point, your engagement is worth a free meal to him. \n\nOuch.", "NTA but it sounds like your going to marry one..... Especially if he was trying to scam a free meal out of a restaurant.", "nta. he knows it bothers you and is still doing it just to save some money. He cares more about saving some money, than considering your feelings.", ">[He said] I should have played along as we could've got our dinner comped/ free dessert\n\nNTA and how cheap is this guy? Does he also say it's his birthday to get comped? Or claim hardship to get discounts? Ugh.", "Well, now you know that your discomfort is less important to him than the hope of a free meal. Get used to it. This is your life now. Or don't. Absolutely NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is though.", "NTA.  Why do YOU have to \"play along\" instead of HIM respecting your feelings and not repeatedly doing what you do not find funny?  Also getting things comped by fake proposals is a shitty thing to do, and I'd be rethinking the relationship at this point.", "NTA. His repeated proposals ridicule the sanctity and supposed sincerity of his original proposal. Was it a joke to him too when he first proposed and you accepted? Or did he also do that for attention and a free Bananas Foster?  \n\nYour memory of his proposal and the sight of the love of your life on one knee asking to spending his life with you is now forever tarnished by your memory of all the instances of him getting on one knee and mocking that ritual by performing it for crowds at bus stops and Burger Kings and where else he thinks he can get a laugh.", "NTA it\u2019s annoying and it\u2019s making a game out of something that should be meaningful to get attention and free dessert.", "NTA.

You made how you felt about it clear. Now he's crossing boundaries over a joke that I personally find a bit odd. If you're to be married and spend the rest of your lives together, mutual respect and understanding each other's boundaries has to be a 2-way street.", "NTA.\n\nThe next time he proposes say \"No\" loudly so everyone can hear it.\n\nTell him you thought it would be a funny joke since you're already engaged.", "NTA he isn\u2019t doing it as a joke, he\u2019s doing it as a free meal. He wants to get things comped if he\u2019s only doing it at restaurants. If not, then he wants to do it for the thrill and the attention. You need to have a conversation again about how you don\u2019t like this", " Fish\u2019s", "NTA.\n\nI feel like you're leaving something out because I really don't see why he'd think proposing again is a good joke. What's the punchline? \"Haha, I asked you to marry me!\"", "I knew someone who would fake proposals with her male best friend to get free drinks and meals weekly and word gets around to bartenders and servers between restaurants, it\u2019s not a cute trick and you are absolutely NTA to feel uncomfortable with your fianc\u00e9 doing it. If he continues to do this on the idea that your food and drinks will get comped for this repeatedly while you\u2019re out, I would not be surprised if you end up banned from some favorite restaurants after a while. The person I knew ended up with temporary bans from several establishments because they pulled this trick so often and it got gossiped about. Bartenders and servers in any town or city with decent nightlife are like a mycelia network- I regularly hear information and gossip about and from other bars and restaurants nearby the one I work shows at and this would get nipped in the bud so quick.", "he's a little old to repeat a silly \"joke\" that isn't funny.  He will exhibit immaturity in many ways", "NTA. Why in the hell does he keep doing this? Like... even if you hadn't told him \"this bothers me, please let's not do it anymore,\" I am BAFFLED by his obsession with doing this. It sounds like he just wants the attention and it's even weirder considering he chose to officially propose in private. This just. Something about it hits weird. All that aside, asking him to stop and him not stopping? Maybe not a big red flag but could be a tiny orange one. I would tell him very frankly you're not going to feel guilty and you're not going to accept being called an asshole AFTER you told him how you felt about this and he completely disregarded you. And I would follow that up with a question of \"how are you going to react to something more important or serious? are you going to ignore my feelings then, too? because boundaries matter to me.\"", "NTA you clearly expressed how it made you feel and he ignored that. That isn't okay. He may not agree with your opinion, but at the same time should respect that it makes you feel uncomfortable.", "If you\u2019ve said not to and he keeps doing it, he\u2019s trying to show you how he\u2019s right and you\u2019re wrong aka good luck", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnd the relationship. He is doing this on purpose to annoy you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Maybe start reacting with a loud \"marry YOU? Look at yourself. Certainly not.\"   .. and tell him it was just a joke.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"He is calling me TA for overreacting over a joke\" .. Do you think he will be an AH, overreacting over a joke?", "I wasnt aware that joke proposing in public after a couple were already engaged was a thing. That doesnt seem normal", "Ewwwww. NTA\n\nHe's just using you for attention and to see if he can get free stuff. Next time he does it, either say that you said yes the last 50,000 times, and don't understand why he needs to keep asking, or say no and walk away. And really think if you want to marry this guy.", "NTA.  Ask him why it's funny to steal food from a restaurant and embarrass you at the same time.", "NTA and don\u2019t marry this guy. He doesn\u2019t listen to you or respect you. \n\nHe thinks it\u2019s funny or likes the attention, you went along with it a couple times but then told him how you feel and asked him not to do it. He did it anyway. \n\nThat will be the cycle throughout your marriage.", "OOo I like this. Don't forget to say after \"It's just a joke! You could've just gone along with it!\"", "I know you\u2019re having sex with my sister! And my brother!", "And sis is now pregnant", "YESSSSS", "Say \u2018ew, no, you\u2019re my brother!\u2019", "You beat me to the sister comment!\n\nThe only natural response to him continuing to embarrass her is to embarrass him back.
