She doesn\u2019t speak Russian and has a hard time decision-making.", "selftext": "Recently, I (22F) went to Russia with my friend (26F). I speak good Russian, and my friend doesn\u2019t speak any, so I was basically leading us the entire trip. One thing about my friend is that she has a lot of childhood trauma, so she has some developmental issues and can often make bad decisions. However, she is NOT mentally handicapped. \n\nWell, our trip was supposed to last 10 days, but my friend met some random guy and they really hit it off. She kept begging me to stay another week and change my plane ticket, but I could not. \n\nI landed a well-paying job in October, but the company is very strict. I\u2019m new and don\u2019t want to risk anything. One simple mistake can get you kicked out. I hate the job, but I\u2019m going to force myself to do it for a few years so I can pay off my hefty student loans. \n\nI told her I couldn\u2019t afford to stay, and she wasn\u2019t budging or listening to my pleas, so I did what I had to do and left on the scheduled departure date. She, on the other hand, extended her stay for 10 more days. Sadly, the guy ditched her two days after my flight. \n\nSo, she ended up struggling a lot in Russia for the next week. She was struggling to order food, get help, order cabs, etc. According to her, she even ended up losing $700 to scammers. She was angry and kept calling me, our friends kept calling me, her family kept calling me. Everyone kept telling me what I did was wrong and put her in danger, and that I should\u2019ve just stayed for a few more days knowing what she is like. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672459261, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzkswe/aita_for_stranding_my_friend_in_russia_she_doesnt/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She knew the risk she was taking in staying without knowing the language. She did it anyways. \n\nShe could have come back with you, as was originally planned. Everyone else is enabling her.", "NTA\n\nEven **entirely disregarding** this preposterous extended stay...\n\nCoupling up with some townie when you're **on a trip with your friend** is an asshole move in the first place.", "NTA. You gave her all the information and told her what you had to do. She chose to extend her trip (it would have been different if you shortened yours). Her bad. You held up your end of the bargain (going into the trip).", "NTA. What were you supposed to do\u2026 stick around in a hotel room in Russia (on your dime) just in case she needed you while she was off frolicking with her man? Yeah\u2026. No. No one would agree when there were things like jobs on the line at home.  She\u2019s an adult, and is responsible for the choices she makes, good or bad.", "NTA\n\nShe was an adult, you could not force her to leave.\n\nHer friends can go get her", "NTA you didn\u2019t ditch her and leave her stranded in a foreign country. She refused to leave on the scheduled day with you. That\u2019s on her, and decisions have consequences.", "NTA.  If everyone is so aware of her poor decision making skills, then why did they not tell her to come home with you? She made a decision to extend her stay and you came home when you were supposed to. I don't see how it not going well for her is your fault.\nAlso, your choice in friends is a bit sketchy. You need to fix that.", "NTA\n\nYou did your best to try to convince her to go with you on the scheduled day.  I don't know what more you could've done, hold her at gunpoint until she goes with you!?\n\nShe could've changed her flight again, no?  That might have cost some fees but at least it would save on hotel and food and get her out of danger.  Was that option explored?  If not, it should've been.", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t ditch her. She ditched you for a guy!", "NTA. Your friend is an adult and made her decision.", "NTA. She\u2019s an adult. She made an adult decision, granted a poor one. You\u2019re making a sane, good decision to return. She put herself in danger.", "NTA.  She made a terrible decision.  Hope she got home okay so she can learn to make better ones.", "NTA - she changed the plans, not you", "NTA - You were clear. She's an adult. She made a bad decision.", "These days and times why would any American with sense want to extend a stay in Russia for a foreign dick? NTA and I hope you stop being her sitter so her family doesnt have to deal with her. Shes not your problem.", "NTA. Your friend met, essentially, a stranger and decided to extend her trip for him, knowing you\u2019d be gone. That\u2019s a risk she was willing to take. It wasn\u2019t like you abandoned her.", "NTA. You should not have to put your future at risk because she wants a fling.  If you had nothing to do, maybe then, but you had something pre-planned that is life changing. After the guy ditched her, she should have tried to change her tickets to go home sooner.", "NTA at all and idk how anyone could think you are. \n\nYou went on vacation with a friend and went home on the agreed date. It\u2019s nice that she can afford to impulsively extend her vacations, but most people can\u2019t. Most adults have to be back at work and pay bills. \n\nShe decided to take the risk and stay with someone she barely knew. Kinda ridiculous that instead of being an adult and accepting the consequences of her actions she wants to blame them on you.", "NTA. No, just no; your friend choose to stay for a guy; that\u2019s on her. You don\u2019t risk your future to hold your friend\u2019s hand. You are her friend, not her personal therapist. Her trauma is hers to manage; and it doesn\u2019t sound like trauma was why she choose to stay; but because she decided she was in love\u2026\nIf she is that incapable of making her own decisions; her parents need to take action.", "NTA. You chose to not change your plans for some random guy in another country, and she chose to stay.\n\nHer family should have been calling HER to get her a plane ticket to come home instead of calling you.", "NTA you agreed on the original length of your trip. That's a huge unreasonable ask for someone to make.", "NTA-You clearly let her know you couldn\u2019t extend the trip and that you had your job to get back to. She made a decision and she had the consequences from that decision to stay longer.  You didn\u2019t put her in danger, she made bad decisions.", "NTA. Tell the people blaming you for it that they are more than welcome to spend the money to babysit an adult.", "NTA. Just no. Your \u201cfriend\u201d needs to learn accountability. She is not your responsibility, and while I can understand trauma and the resulting affects it is not your place to coddle her behavior as a grown adult.\nIt seems like her family and other friends rely on you to babysit her and may just enable her poor behavior by continually coddling her. \nYou are not an ahole for acting responsibly and putting your priorities in order. She made her decision and that\u2019s on her, not you.", "NTA but I gotta ask: who in their right mind goes on vacation to RUSSIA when they are at war? That sounds like the first bad decision on this trip.", "NTA. You didn't strand her in Russia. She chose to stay an extra week, of her own accord. You had responsibilities to get back to. Don't let her manipulate you. This was her choice. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Some people only learn things the hard way. You explained you could not stay longer and you all already had only planned to stay a certain amount of time. Totally selfish of her..\n\nI can't help but laugh honestly. I bet she had a rude awakening when her new bf kicked her to the curb. Lol\nWhat did she honestly expect? It's absurd.", "NTA\n\nBut I have a question. Visiting Russia? Now?! Seriously?!", "NTA. Your friend's actions weren't according to the plan you had just made. You cannot expect other people to risk losing their job, just because you have a whim.", "NTA. Sad story, but not your fault.", "NTA\n\nYou left off in the agreed upon date", "Not the a******. Your friend is an adult and she made her own decisions. You made yours which were best for you. You're not responsible for her.", "NTA. The way you even phrased it is incorrect. You dod not leave your friend stranded. She chose to stay. You could not. Her choice was outside of your control and you stuck with the plan. You did nothing wrong here.", "NTA. She is an adult and decided to stay.", "NTA. If she's this irresponsible and incapable of making decisions for herself, she needs to be in the care of an adult that can make these decisions for her. That is not you.", "NTA. FAFO, and that's what she did. She could have tried to get an earlier ticket or asked others for help but making you lose a job? Nope.", "NTA. \nShe is the one that decided to change the plans\u2026 your friend is an adult \u2026 the saying \u201c you made your bed now you have to lie in it \u201c  really applys here\u2026\nShe decided to stay, she put herself in that position so now SHE has to deal with it.", "NTA.\n\nYou left on the pre-arranged flight. \n\nShe CHOSE to stay behind. \n\nYour OLDER \u201cfriend\u201d chose random di** over you. \n\nShe was willing to risk YOUR job bc she wanted to get laid. \n\nNot your problem.", "NTA. \n\nDoesn't she have a smart phone? Google Translate.", "Jeopardizing your employment for a hookup is not reasonable at all. NTA", "Nta. She, an adult, made her own decision to stay in a strange country with a strange man knowing you were leaving and that you did not think it was a good idea.

But once I got to the point where you mention your plane ticket, work situation, and her refusal to work with you you definitely aren\u2019t .YTA.\n\nI\u2019d have to say NTA . Your friend randomly decided to stay longer when you had work obligations and a return flight already booked. I feel the expectation you would extent your trip because of this guy she met is a ridiculous thing to ask, especially considering there being a real chance your job could be at jeopardy if you aren\u2019t back for work.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
