I speak good Russian, and my friend doesn\u2019t speak any, so I was basically leading us the entire trip. One thing about my friend is that she has a lot of childhood trauma, so she has some developmental issues and can often make bad decisions. However, she is NOT mentally handicapped. \n\nWell, our trip was supposed to last 10 days, but my friend met some random guy and they really hit it off. She kept begging me to stay another week and change my plane ticket, but I could not. \n\nI landed a well-paying job in October, but the company is very strict. I\u2019m new and don\u2019t want to risk anything. One simple mistake can get you kicked out. I hate the job, but I\u2019m going to force myself to do it for a few years so I can pay off my hefty student loans. \n\nI told her I couldn\u2019t afford to stay, and she wasn\u2019t budging or listening to my pleas, so I did what I had to do and left on the scheduled departure date. She, on the other hand, extended her stay for 10 more days. Sadly, the guy ditched her two days after my flight. \n\nSo, she ended up struggling a lot in Russia for the next week. She was struggling to order food, get help, order cabs, etc. According to her, she even ended up losing $700 to scammers. She was angry and kept calling me, our friends kept calling me, her family kept calling me. Everyone kept telling me what I did was wrong and put her in danger, and that I should\u2019ve just stayed for a few more days knowing what she is like. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672459261, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzkswe/aita_for_stranding_my_friend_in_russia_she_doesnt/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kinda ridiculous that instead of being an adult and accepting the consequences of her actions she wants to blame them on you.", "NTA. No, just no; your friend choose to stay for a guy; that\u2019s on her. You don\u2019t risk your future to hold your friend\u2019s hand. You are her friend, not her personal therapist.

Tell the people blaming you for it that they are more than welcome to spend the money to babysit an adult.", "NTA. Just no. Your \u201cfriend\u201d needs to learn accountability. She is not your responsibility, and while I can understand trauma and the resulting affects it is not your place to coddle her behavior as a grown adult.\nIt seems like her family and other friends rely on you to babysit her and may just enable her poor behavior by continually coddling her. \nYou are not an ahole for acting responsibly and putting your priorities in order.

Don't let her manipulate you. This was her choice. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Some people only learn things the hard way. You explained you could not stay longer and you all already had only planned to stay a certain amount of time. Totally selfish of her..\n\nI can't help but laugh honestly. I bet she had a rude awakening when her new bf kicked her to the curb. Lol\nWhat did she honestly expect? It's absurd.", "NTA\n\nBut I have a question. Visiting Russia? Now?! Seriously?!", "NTA. Your friend's actions weren't according to the plan you had just made. You cannot expect other people to risk losing their job, just because you have a whim.", "NTA. Sad story, but not your fault.", "NTA\n\nYou left off in the agreed upon date", "Not the a******. Your friend is an adult and she made her own decisions. You made yours which were best for you. You're not responsible for her.", "NTA. The way you even phrased it is incorrect. You dod not leave your friend stranded. She chose to stay. You could not. Her choice was outside of your control and you stuck with the plan. You did nothing wrong here.", "NTA. She is an adult and decided to stay.", "NTA. If she's this irresponsible and incapable of making decisions for herself, she needs to be in the care of an adult that can make these decisions for her. That is not you.", "NTA.

Your friend randomly decided to stay longer when you had work obligations and a return flight already booked.
