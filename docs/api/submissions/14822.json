She's content with making HIM wash them when it happens. That's not bad, but can't be comfortable for him.\n\nSo I went out and bought him a small bag of goodnites.

I feel badly for your nephew though. I hope his parents have had him evaluated for medical and/or psychological reasons that could cause him to be still wetting the bed at 13. It almost seems like his mother is acting like he does it on purpose. Wearing a \"diaper\" to bed would be a far better solution than soiling his clothes every night.", "NTA. SIL will let her son wet himself and your couch in some backwards attempt to appease her own vanity about diapers. This kids needs diapers AND therapy. I'm sure being the source of so much contention in his family is not helping.", "Nta, his mum needs some therapy & needs to realise that there are far better ways to tackle the root of the problem", "Update:\n\nPeople keep bringing it up so.\n\nHis pediatrician says he's fin. That it's something he needs to grow out of recommended My Brother and SIL buy his protection. \n\nThey've tried a urologist that basically gave them the same answer along with some basic recommendations. \n\nNephew seeing a psychotherapist, SIL doesn't believe in them.", "wow. seems like we can see why he still wets the bed with that drama going on.\n\nNTA- thankyou for allowing him to have a good nights rest and not waking up to soaking in his own pee.  Seems like the poor kid needs to see a doctor and a therapist to deal with this.", "NTA. Your SIL is awful. This poor kid has a physiological issue he can\u2019t control and all the adults around him are making him feel like shit about it. \n\nYour intentions were kind, but you gotta imagine it\u2019s not a good call to buy a kid pullups when his parents explicitly forbid them and call them \u201cdiapers.\u201d For a kid thats going to be even more traumatizing. But thats on your SIL, not you.\n\nThey however are absolute shitheels for not addressing these issues when traveling. Your poor nephew \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. I am not sure what would be more embarrassing for the kid, discreetly wearing the diaper or making a huge mess that everyone finds out about.\n\nWhile I agree the SIL is being very unreasonable, I can appreciate how this is a very embarrassing and stressful issue for the entire family. This makes it incredibly difficult to travel and that poor kid must feel such shame. It would be heartbreaking to watch your teen go through that. If his parents were decent, they have likely tried everything to get it to stop, but it isn't helping. Or if they haven't, they need to speak to a pediatrician. I imagine tempers were just running hot here. I get that SIL was probably just trying to treat her teen maturely, but the fact is that he has a medical issue that must be managed. Soiling other peoples' property is just not acceptable.", "NTA - Kid can't control this stuff, as we of rational minds commenting here all know. His mom is the asshole, but if she wants to keep putting her son through pissing on himself and his bed and all that, I guess that's up to those weirdo people. Wouldn't want him pissing on my couch either though, so good on that trooper of a kid for trying the pull-ups out.", "oh my god this poor kid, I can\u2019t even fathom a judgment", "NTA. Anyone who knows anything about child psychology can make an educated guess that SILs emotional abuse is the cause of her sons bed wetting", "Poor baby! You are the absolute opposite of the AH your are the savior. It's almost like a form of child abuse for his mother to know that he will have an accident and not properly prepare him for the night. Also, have they spoken to the Dr about this? It might be an underlying issue of something else going on.", "NTA. One of my kids had bed wetting. They outgrew it years before your nephew, but still old enough they were sensitive about it. We used Good Nights. We made sure to quietly celebrate if they had a dry night, but not a big deal if they didn\u2019t. Hopefully your SIL and brother have looked into any medical causes. But you purchasing the Good Nights, allowing him the option of using them, and not causing a big fuss over the situation was a great way of handling this! Your SIL, horrible way of handling this. He does not need or deserve her creating a scene with everyone in the family. It\u2019s awkward and embarrassing enough for him. He may be her son, but what she\u2019s doing to him is horrible.", "NTA. OMG that poor kid.", "Another update to add.\n\nI don't think she hates \"diapers\"\n\nI think her problem is that she doesn't like him doing things that aren't \"age appropriate\"\n\nLike if he'd be seen coloring in a coloring book with idk Elmo in it, she'd take it because he's to old for Elmo.\n\nOr if he wanted to watch an R rated movie, even if it's very tame. She'd say he's to young for it.\n\nI'm surprised i got away with getting him an Easter basket.", "NTA. Your couch, and frankly, it should be HIS decision, not his mother's. This isn't completely an uncommon situation, and he should be able to feel confident about falling asleep and waking up relatively dry. She's setting him up for a lot of problems, esp with sleepovers.", "NTA and mom needs to consult his physician about the next steps to solve this problem, which could have medical or psychiatric causes.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI can't believe that woman is forcing her son to wake up soaked in urine every day.", "NTA. Your abusive SIL is probably the reason he still wets the bed, though.", "Did you try taking him to the doctors something might be wrong with his body", "Nta but that child needs a multi disciplinary team to work out why he\u2019s been struggling with enuresis for so many years. Your SIL is a mole and likely knows what abuse has led her child to this which explains her extreme defensiveness.", "Whilst your SIL sound like she has the wrong attitude, and what you do while visiting someone else's house isn't the same as what you can feel is acceptable at home, there is some truth in what she's doing. My 15yr old has just been discharged from the enuresis clinic he's been attending for over 6 years. I was told to refrain from using pull-ups and to instead leave him in pjs, to help him learn when he goes. However, he was also under the supervision of a doctor and taking medications to help replace the hormones his body wasn't making properly, and whenever we went on holiday or stayed over at someone else's, I made sure he had pull-ups and a mat for the bed too.", "NTA  Hopefully they are bringing him to a Pediatric Urologist for an evaluation and treatment.", "You like paragraphs more than I do", "Please look into why kids wet the bed. \n\nWhether it's obvious to others or not, he may need a different connection with her than he has. This isn't about you. You can try to help him though. \n\nCan you suggest counseling? Can you talk to your sister? Send her some information? Think about how she might best respond. See what you can do to inspire confidence in him and security in the knowledge that he's loved and will be cared for and accepted.", "NTA\n\nThis sometimes happens to boys from the ages of 11-14 due to whacky hormones. It's perfectly normal and he'll grow out of it with puberty (provided nothing else is going on). It can be combated with mattress covers and pullups.\n\nAlso, you could tell your BIL/SIL that there is a device your nephew can clip onto his underwear. When it detects wetness it will wake him up by vibrating, this will give him a routine of waking up to use the bathroom and get his body used to doing so.\n\nEdit: it's called a bedwetting alarm (had forgotten the name of it).", "I just hope the parents take the kid to the doctor to get him checked out. Or to a therapist. Get him to someone that can help.", "This kid needs medical help and maybe a therapist. He shouldn't be wetting the bed at his age", "I'm not his doctor\n\nBut I'm wondering if the reason for these accidents isn't your SIL and how he treats him.\n\nNTA but maybe start planting the idea of therapy in yoyr brother's head, WITHOUT SIL knowing.", "NTA at all. Usually, I'm generally anti-going against parents' wishes, however your nephew's issue has caused soiling of your own property, which you have a right to protect. Your nephew also has the right to choose how he deals with his problem, and to have minimal mess to wake up to, and therefore you did the right thing for him and for yourself. His parents are huge AHs because they don't seem to be dealing with the issue at hand- your nephew should be seeking medical advice, in order to ascertain if he has a mental health condition causing him to wet the bed, or a urinary tract issue causing a lack of control- ignoring it could make things worse. Your nephew's parents are also AHs for knowing he has this problem and bringing him to stay in other people's homes on an overnight basis, and knowing that other people's beds or sofas can be ruined in the process.", "SIL and brother are failing their son by not getting him medical attention. And you're not calling them on it, just putting a bandaid on the situation. ESH", "ESH! This child needs professional help and everyone is too concerned about the optics and their possessions. Poor kid.", "ESH. SIL is the most AH, but you can't circumvent her parenting. And going behind her back and giving him something she has prohibited is never right. Again she's being a jackwad. And I get you wanted to save your couch.

I live a state away, I can only do so much without over stepping more then I have.", "I raised the question of wondering when the subject was broached with said Dr. Like if they consulted the pediatrician at age 5 or 6 then yeah I can understand the pediatrician saying wait and see/grow out of it ..", "I'm sorry... serial killers? Some parents put off getting their kid important medical treatment because they think they're doing this as a future serial killer??? What even is this world anymore?\n\nI feel for the poor kid. I hope he gets the treatment he needs. NTA op.", "That is so sad for your nephew. He can't deny it. \n\nThere is so much a parent can do to help their child develop the appropriate bladder control. \n\nMaking sure they don't hold it in during the day. \n\nReducing sugary drinks/snacks before bedtime (excess sugar is released in urine) \n\nThey make alarms that fasten to underwear that go off when wet. This helps kids learn to wake up to body signals. \n\nAnd the inhales hormones that suppress bladder and kidney function. \n\nI used all of these with my kids. Even the medication so they could live a normal life. I wanted them to be able to stay at friends/family homes without worrying about being embarrassed.", "That\u2019s absolutely right, and her having him clean it up is shaming him for something physical that he has no control over. \n\nShe\u2019s doing him deep psychological harm by responding like this, and it\u2019s traumatizing for a child because he\u2019s seeing that his parent\u2019s love is conditional. Children will always internalize this and believe that they are unlovable and a problem, because that\u2019s less painful than having an unreliable parent.\n\nI would find some resources (studies or articles) on the impact of childhood trauma and on insecure attachment. It is so profoundly harmful, it\u2019s truly staggering. It can cause chronic health problems, chronic pain - all kinds of awful stuff, because we need secure, loving relationships to feel safe in the world. Kids are completely dependent on their parents to even be able to eat or have clothing, so the absence of that secure attachment is \u201cin fear for your life\u201d level distress that permanently alters the brain.\n\nShe\u2019s being emotionally abusive to her child.\n\nFull stop.\n\nIf your brother isn\u2019t taking this seriously enough to take more action, please call your country\u2019s child protection agency. Then a social worker can visit and mandate her to go to therapy or anger management, learn how she\u2019s harming her child, and how to do better. It will at least mean someone is looking in on her, and minimizing the impact on your nephew.", "I've noticed she seems to have a thing against anything that isn't \"age appropriate\".", "He's seen his pediatrician and a urologist. Both basically said he was fine and he'd grow out of it.", "A hotel would be like slapping my Bro in the face. He didn't look mortified but dejected. I'm sure i wasn't the first to bring up pullups. i didn't hand them to him. I set them and the bag they were in front of the couch and let him take his time to investigate them. All i told him is that i bought him something that should help him though the night and asked hi if he'd give them a try. \n\nIt was his investigation that his mother saw him looking at one.", "While I understand his point of view, I was the kid in this. I was in high school before I stopped. Pull-ups were not available at the time. I would have loved to put one on and not worry about the sheets or my clothes.", "I have heard that not giving the kid milk after like lunchtime helps with bedwetting too", "I don\u2019t believe you. Sorry. In another comment you mention the pediatrician but not a urologist. I hope your brother can really advocate for him and get him some real assistance. The stress from the family when he DOES have an accident is probably really making it worse.", "Look, I get where you're coming from. But as the parent of a teenager with special needs, what you did isn't right. You don't interject yourself into the middle of a complex situation and take control. Let the parents handle their child how they see fit. If you got concerns about your property, address those concerns. But you don't get the parent somebody else's child.", "I don't know that one, but my own experience is at least 20 years old. My kiddos are all grown now.", "I used pediatrician loosely to say he has seen doctors about it.  I added Urologist to be more specific because some one mentioned it. He's been to both. Though i think they should give the Urologist another try.", "I didn't tell him what he should or shouldn't do. I have him something and let him do what he wanted with it. My Brother isn't upset with me at all. He's already tried what i did. SIL is the odd one out.", "Oh haha\n\nLuckily my kids were never bedwetters, but I read quite a bit on the subject, and had seen that advice pop up!", "Do you know whether that visit was recent? I could understand the doctors saying that about a much younger kid and I can imagine your sil not wanting to consider that that opinion would be different for a 13yo.", "NTA but uhhhhhhhh his mom constantly screaming at him is probably directly correlated to his bed wetting", "NTA.  I hate to say it but SIL sounds abusive, and she is causing further harm to your nephew.", "SIL response to his accidents is contributing to him growing out of it! It might also be time to see a specialist (pediatric urologist) as they would be the most up-to-date about the most current treatment and meds for nocturnal enuresis (bed wetting).\n\nSIL needs to go to therapy much more than nephew!", "Your brother is allowing his son to be harmed. Diapers and pull ups are helpful for preventing infection. Urine can cause burns on the skin.", "Your brother needs to start being a father not a doormat. He needs to put that poor kids needs over the abusive mothers wants. Kid needs medical treatment/investigation or therapy.\nNTA For trying to help your nephew but for his sake have a long chat with your brother", "This is neglect at this point. If he's not even allowed to wear pull ups, which is totally fine to do (in fact, insurance will even cover them in cases where a patient has incontinence, because it's a medical item. Would she say the same thing to a woman for using a pad and not wearing rubber pants)", "My son was 6 when they decided he'd had long enough to grow out of it. Luckily an alarm was pretty effective for him, but they were not going to wait until he was a teenager. I'm going to go right ahead and assume that this kid's mother is causing enough psychological damage to make it extremely difficult for him to stop. Its really something that just gets worse when you pressure them and get angry about it.", "My 9 year old still wets the bed about once a week. Her pediatrician says everything is fine. I\u2019m going to ask about some of the things you\u2019ve suggested. Thank you so much for the advice!"]}
