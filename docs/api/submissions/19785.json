She wakes up at 5am, does yoga in the spare room, goes on a quick run and comes home to make a smoothie using one of those loud nutri-ninja blenders and will get on with her day. She also meditates in there, journals and does other things that I can't disrupt her because its her personal time. She was like this before I met her and was clear that if I wasn't on board with this aspect of her routine, she doesn't want to pursue anything with me. While I am not thrilled she has that whole room for herself (I did ask if I could put my PC in there so it's not in the dining room space), it was there before I moved in with her so I made my peace with it.\n\nMy sister is coming into town with her partner and young daughter (6F). We both agreed on letting them stay with us to save money. My wife wants them to sleep in the living room because we have multiple comfortable sofas for them to sleep on. While there is enough room, I made my case for buying air matresses for them and to set them up in my wife's spare room. I also asked her if she would part with her smoothie making at least until they wake up so they aren't disturbed in the morning.\n\nMy wife is vehemently opposed to giving up her room and smoothies. She doesn't think the room will be comfortable for them (no carpets and its got huge windows and massive mirrors on one wall) and that I'm using this situation as a way to disrupt her routine I apparently hate. I'm not sure where she got that from since I've never asked her to change it. We're in a disagreement over where they should stay and my wife is event threatening to not allow them to stay and have them get a hotel for the visit. AITA? I don't think giving up the room is that hard an ask for my family's comfort and it's only 3 days.\n\nETA - Thank you for all the advice everyone, I am heading to bed now. I have decided not to push this issue any further with my wife and my sister and family can use the sofas or I will pay partly for a hotel for them.

The visit is \u201c3 days is the official length of time, potentially longer but they\u2019re not concrete on that\u201d. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nSo you keep saying it\u2019s only 3 days, but it might not be. You\u2019re asking her to give up her routine for the unspecified duration of time.\n\n2. Her routine appears to be rigid and of long standing. She has a set exercise routine and the smoothie is the source of most of her vitamins and nutrients. You\u2019d like her to switch her exercise, meditation and eating for their visit.\n\n3. You live in a 4 bedroom house, yet the only room you wish to offer up is the one that is exclusively your wife\u2019s. Which has no carpeting, nothing in it and \u201clots of natural light\u201d.\n\n4. The choice is between air mattresses and couches. And your family is fine with the couches.\n\nYTA for how you\u2019re acting and also how you\u2019ve presented this. The only thing I\u2019d suggest she change is the smoothies- either make ahead the night before or have her pick up while out on her run.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and my wife is event threatening to not allow them to stay and have them get a hotel for the visit. \" .. This is the reasonable solution: Living room, or a hotel.", "YTA \n\nYour sister is fine with the sofas for three days. \n\nThe room doesn't sound particularly better with no curtains and bare floors. \n\nHer routine is a deal-breaker to her, which means it's very important. You knew this from the start. You say you made peace with it but you clearly haven't. You quietly resent her monopoly on the space and the rigidity of her mornings.\n\nYour wife said hard no. Your sister has no issue, the sofa's seem perfectly workable for a short stay. You are the one making this an issue.\n\n I think your wife is dead on - that you are using this as an excuse to try and put a dent in this well settled equilibrium and you intend to use a forced break in her routine and use of the space to try and renegotiate the terms you pretended to accept coming into this relationship.\n\nIf you have issues with her routine or her room, then communicate with her honestly and openly. There are things that she could bend a little on, like not making smoothies so early. However stop being underhanded about it, it's not respectful, kind, or working. She's not falling for it mate and neither is anyone here..", "YTA - It\u2019s pretty clear from what you\u2019ve written that you do have an issue with your wife\u2019s routine and her use of the room for it. She was up front early in your relationship that this was a dealbreaker for her. You accepted this fact, at least outwardly to her although it seems like you were hoping it would end eventually. \n\nI do feel the smoothie thing is the only hang up I have. Her not being willing to compromise on that doesn\u2019t seem very reasonable. Maybe for those three days she could blend her smoothies the night before?\n\nHave you ever had a discussion with your wife about why she has her routine or how it developed? It does seem like kind of an extreme routine, but without knowing her reasoning for it it\u2019s hard to say.", "As someone who is currently in the throes of a deep dark depression, I feel like your wife\u2019s routine was possibly born out of absolute necessity, and that it may be the thing that keeps her functional. I would say that she was very clear to you as to how important her routine was, so I do think that YTA for wanting her to change it. I do also understand that she may be seen as non-accommodating, but it was never a secret. Sometimes things that look selfish, are more than what they seem from the outside.", "YTA for saying \"I apparently hate. I'm not sure where she got that from since I've never asked her to change it.\" because you act like never asking her to change her routine means you're not clearly and obviously seething with resentment over it. It's all over the post. Her routine is something that works for her health-wise and requires nothing from you at all except a little space (one room in a whole house). \n\nWhile it would be totally fine to change her routine for the duration of sis's visit, it's also fine to have them sleep in the living room.\n\nQuotes that show the seething resentment your wife is picking up on:\n\n\"other things that I can't disrupt her because its her personal time.

You have been married for 2 years and she has continued this routine.\n\n>I don't think giving up the room is that hard an ask\n\nShe made it clear she has a routine. She is trying to work with you by letting them stay with y'all, but you are so desperate to interrupt a routine that is somehow bugging you that you refuse to see it. Perhaps you should ask yourself WHY you are so resentful of this routine? Is it because it is HER time with herself and she isn't paying attention to you? Or because you are jealous that you don't have that same dedicated time allotted for you to have you time? Look at yourself, and figure it out soon.", "YTA. Seems like this is just an excuse to force her to stop something that makes her happy.", "YTA, respect her my gosh. Who cares if she has this routine? Make a routine for yourself instead of feeling the need to disrupt hers.", "YTA. Sounds like your wife made the importance of her routine plain to you a long time ago. They can sleep in the living room. How long does it take to make a smoothie? They can go back to sleep. And like you said, it\u2019s only 3 days. Your sister and her kid will live. I get that you want to cater to your guests, but you\u2019re doing them a favor and I don\u2019t think your wife should have to sacrifice more than necessary on top of that.", "Dude. You knew all this before you got married and now you're acting surprised that *she actually meant it*?\n\nYeah, YTA.

Personally, I think it\u2019s pretty balanced right now. She made it clear what matters to her when you got together. \u201cMaking your peace with it\u201d doesn\u2019t count for peanuts mate. \n\nit sounds like your wife is pretty clear eyed about what\u2019s going on here, and she\u2019s right on the money. i assume you married her because you liked her as she is\u2026\n\nIt looks like this is the hill that your marriage could die on - sooner or later.

Time to think about your own.", "YTA.\n\nYOU WERE TOLD that she has a boundary on this topic.\n\nYou're trying to demolish it.\n\nShe should take her house back and let you, sis, and niece go where you would OUTSIDE HER HOUSE.", "Yes, YTA. \n\n>She was like this before I met her and was clear that if I wasn't on board with this aspect of her routine, she doesn't want to pursue anything with me.\n\nOk, so you supposed made your peace with it, but now you \"need\" to interrupt her routine? No. \n\n>While there is enough room, I made my case for buying air matresses for them and to set them up in my wife's spare room.\n\nThere's enough room. Full stop. Don't invade her space why is that such a hard concept? \n\nYou have a point with asking her to delay making the smoothies, especially if your guests are sleeping near where she makes them (kitchen?). She should compromise on that as a good host - but giving up her space shouldn't even be a question especially in HER home that was already established.", "Yta.  It\u2019s her room and she doesn\u2019t want to give it up for guests.  If your family wants privacy, they should shell out the money for a hotel.

Let your sister know what to expect (living room couches, early smoothie noise, etc) so she can decide whether she'd rather just hotel it.", "The only thing I think you could reasonably ask if she is open to changing is making her smoothie in the morning so early. If she is open to it, you could ask her to make it the night before and store it in the fridge overnight, just so the noise of the blender is avoided. She would still have her smoothie at the expected point in her routine, just not use the blender so early.\n\nBut if she is not open to that change, you need to warn your guests about the early morning routine and give them ample opportunity to book alternative accommodation.\n\nIf you don't warn your guests upfront then YTA for sure.", "Info: If you don't have a guest room, why not have a sofa bed, pull out of the couch?\n\nYTA for thinking of unreasonable accommodations for guests. If it were a home gym with a rower,  a Bowflex machine, a pelaton or treadmill you wouldn't be asking this question at all. You would just accept the room as a permanent home gym.

It's not a spare room, it's her space, one she has set up for years and clearly needs.", "My problem would be that she makes her smoothies so early. This wouldn\u2019t be very kind to the visitors. Her strict adherence sounds more like ocd.", "YTA. This is her line, important enough to her to choose it over you, which she made clear to you prior to committing.\n\nYou are now attempting to cross that line by prioritizing your sister's temporary comfort over your wife's needs.\n\nAccept that your wife needs what she needs, and have your sister stay at a hotel.", "YTA\n\nyour wife has her life balanced in under control, why you need to brake it? Your sister using your wife house and should adjust for local schedule. I would explain to sister what here would be an early wake up and she should prepare for that.", "YTA.\n\nThat's not a spare room. That's your wife's sanctuary. She established that very early on, and you accepted her terms when you moved in. It's not up to you to offer it to guests.", "YTA, it's her house and comfort zone. If you want your family to be comfortable then get them a hotel or warn them of the noise they will have to endure every morning.\nSounds like your partner has some mental issues though, I would easily put up with change for guests for a few days which is an event that almost never happens so maybe reconsider your relationship if you want change", "I feel some type of way about this situation. Your wife has a whole room to herself, as well as half of the office space, and half of your bedroom space. Everyone keeps saying that it\u2019s her house and her space, but just because op moved into her house doesn\u2019t mean she should continue to live like he doesn\u2019t exist in that space either.

Yay for PTSD \ud83d\ude11 You moved into your wife's house claiming no problems with her routine but you lied cause clearly you do. You also want to usurp her private space in a home she owns because of your ego. You can't let them use your office? Is this about showing how in charge you are or something?", "Sometimes, I'm at loss with some answers, are people not aware how to be decent hosts, is it always a me-i-and-myself game? When I have hosts, I won't hesitate to disrupt my routines ( and I'm a depressed autistic that finds solace in routine!) and sometimes even my bedroom if I receive a whole family.

The terms and conditions of the relationship were made clear to you well in time.", "NTA and your wife is annoying. She seems super selfish. I wonder if she has an eating disorder or exorexia. I can almost tolerate what she does if it was not for the loud blender. If possible pay to put your relatives in a hotel and then go to marriage counseling.

I am sorry you have such an inflexible selfish wife.", "NTA. Hosting people for a few days is a normal thing to do, disrupting your routines slightly for the sake of said guests' comfort and privacy is a normal thing to do. Being completely unable to make noble very short term changes is not normal. It's selfish. Just because she \"communicated her boundaries\" ahead of time doesn't make those boundaries reasonable in perpetuity. Rigidity and being rude to guests (to the point of refusing to host family that isn't making unusual demands) are bad manners, not boundaries. If she has mental health reasons for needing to do things this way and legitimately being unable to ever adjust, then maybe she should have communicated about those details by now.\n\nYoga and journaling can be done in other locations. Smoothies can be made at slightly different times, or purchased. None of this is complicated to organize.", "YTA for the passive aggressive tone about this whole thing.

This is normal when we spend time w/ friends and family in our home.  We put our best selves 'out there' in hopes of it being an awesome visit.\n\nThe room she uses on the daily is only for her needs? It's fine if you both agree but accommodating guests for 72 hrs. out of 365 days in this room is what most people would do. She seems oblivious or simply does not care about her early rooster crowing smoothie. Is she normally unaware of others or is something else going on? (serious).  The outcome of disagreements are sometimes not as valuable as how we treat one another through the process.  Best to you!", "Kind of TA, a bit, yeah.  It's her routine, what you think about whether that's enough to disrupt it doesn't really matter.  And sofas are comfier than air mattresses.  And I firmly believe in hotels = good boundaries.

I struggle with depression, finding and holding a routine is difficult for me but also a necessity. Even a single off day can really throw me off. While it does make sense to allow them to stay there, if her routine is of necessity and is part of her boundaries I would find another option. If she's not ok with it then she's not. Just like if the rolls were reversed she should respect your boundaries as well.", "I've never really questioned the details of how her routine came to be. I do know it was well before she met me and its important. Is it worth asking about do you think?", "The smoothies are keeping her functional though?", "I do not care if he agreed, anyone who needs to run a blender early in the morning with guests is selfish and needs therapy to work through their issues. I am a creature of habit too but that is not an excuse for rudeness. She needs to work through her issues in therapy. Dominating an environment and being unable to care for others is a big issue. Also, people can readjust their positions and evolve over time.", "Jesus Christ it's only 3 days people making mountains out of mole hills.", "Yes, it was her house alone before they got married, but he lives there too, now. He's not a guest, it's his his home as well as hers. And of course that doesn't give him permission to run roughshod over her established routines, but the fact that she is so inflexible about them is confusing and a little concerning. \n\n\n\n~~The spare room for example. She uses it for her morning yoga/meditation/etc. That's great, but is the room only used for that? Getting a total use of, let's say an hour each morning? If she only uses it for her morning routine, why can't he have his PC in there to use in the evenings or afternoons?~~\n\n\n\nIf she is unable to deviate from this routine to the point of not being able to do her morning yoga in a different room for a few days, how does she cope when they travel? Do they travel? She's obviously able to manage adjusting it to some degree, because I doubt she goes running if there a thunderstorm or blizzard. \n\n\n\nAnd as far as secretly hating her routine, we all have things about our partners that we simply tolerate. My partner has a genuinely terrible singing voice. Like, sounds like dying animal level of talent. And yet they love to sing in the shower at the top of their lungs. Do I enjoy it? No. But I put in my headphones and drown it out because it helps them unwind. I don't secretly resent them and try to figure out how to discourage them from singing.\n\n\n\n~~I hate to pull out the \"if the genders were reversed\" card because I think it's usually bullshit, but I think it applies here. Wife marries husband and moves into his house. Husband say this is *my house* and nothing is changing unless he agrees. Wife has to use the dining room for her hobby (maybe for her home office space? It was unclear) because the spare bedroom can only be used for Husband's morning routine and she can't do anything in there even when he's not using it. Now her family is coming to visit for a few days and they have to sleep on couches because the only room big enough for an air mattress is his special morning routine room. Wife suggested his routine be adjusted for a few days and now Husband is threatening that her family can't stay at *his house* at all. Like, come on.~~\n\nEdit: It's been pointed out to me that I missed some of OP's comments where he states he has his own spare bedroom that he uses for his hobbies that could accommodate an air mattress, and that his family has said they're fine with sleeping on the couches (although if his room can accommodate an air mattress I think it would be a dick move to make them sleep on the couch). I've struck through my comment where I feel it no longer applies. I do still think his wife should work on having some more flexibility in her routine for her own sake though, simply because life being what it is, it's likely to get interrupted at some point. But that's not really pertinent to this discussion.", "I don't believe 3 days is enough to disrupt a routine.

I would do the same if it were her relatives coming into town", "I do have my garage but obviously guests can't sleep in there", "I don't understand all the YTAs. If the roles were reversed everyone would be chiming in NTA and saying the spouse would be a dick for not being flexible. \n\nIn all adult relationships there are compromises.

If I'm telling my family \"sorry guys you have to get a hotel even though we have room because my wife is unable to adapt for 3 days\" I'd be mortified. And I REALLY don't like having guests as I need my space and time alone to recharge. \n\nI can understand wanting to keep your room and having your guests sleep in the living room but being this rigid about the 6am blender is not normal, accomodating nor nice all around.", "It\u2019s a 4 bedroom house. She just doesn\u2019t want them in HER routine space. She never said anywhere in the post she wanted them on the couch, just not in THAT space. They could move around their office space and fit a mattress but her room is emptier so he only wants to put them in there. They both also agreed to let them stay for a *minimum* of 3 days, and that might change into longer which is also probably why she doesn\u2019t want to agree to lose her space for an unknown amount of days and ruin her routine that OP says affects her mental health and stresses her out when she *does* adapt it when they\u2019re traveling.\n\nThe smoothies are also apparently how she gets most of her vitamins and nutrients, not just her fun end to her work out. If it was ONLY the smoothie time she would be an asshole but it\u2019s not.", "It's not a non-viable solution. What you mean is that it's inconvenient to him. And so what? His solution is inconvenient to her, and not only that, affects something that she made clear at the start of their relationship is non-negotiable. Especially since his solution is something that he actually wants to implement permanently. He's admitted that he's always wanted her to give up that room.\n\nIMO he should stop making an issue over something that his sister already said they're okay with and just let them stay in the living room. That way everyone gets what they should be after: wife keeps the room, guests get to stay for free in a space they've said they find acceptable, and there's minimal or no work at all for OP. Win-win-win. Except for the part where OP actually wants that room to stop being his wife's personal space, obviously, but that's just him being a jerk.\n\nThe office solution is only due to OP insisting on something no one else has a problem with.", "You wake up crying every couple of hours?", "I had to sleep on one for 6 weeks  (contagious infection I didn't want to pass on to my partner). It wasn't horrendous and I survived!", "Eh. It's not like she's going to be blending for 45 minutes. 30 seconds of blender noise isn't going to kill them.", "At the same time, I would feel absolutely mortified if I had to ask my wife to change her daily routine just to accommodate people who are staying in our house for free mind you. \nI would feel absolutely embarrassed if my friends were so picky that they decided that their needs were more important than the people who live in the actual home and actually pay for it, so that they have a place to stay for free. \n\nWhen you say somewhere for free in order to save money, you adapt to the people who are paying all of the bills, and if they are willing to make compromises and changes that's nice. But you don't get to just expect that when you're staying in someone else's house for free.\n\n6:00 a.m. blender is actually not abnormal for people who wake up for jobs That start anywhere between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. which does happen to be a good chunk of the population given when most businesses open up."]}
