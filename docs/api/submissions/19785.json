The visit is \u201c3 days is the official length of time, potentially longer but they\u2019re not concrete on that\u201d. \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nSo you keep saying it\u2019s only 3 days, but it might not be. You\u2019re asking her to give up her routine for the unspecified duration of time.\n\n2. Her routine appears to be rigid and of long standing. She has a set exercise routine and the smoothie is the source of most of her vitamins and nutrients. You\u2019d like her to switch her exercise, meditation and eating for their visit.\n\n3. You live in a 4 bedroom house, yet the only room you wish to offer up is the one that is exclusively your wife\u2019s. Which has no carpeting, nothing in it and \u201clots of natural light\u201d.\n\n4. The choice is between air mattresses and couches. And your family is fine with the couches.\n\nYTA for how you\u2019re acting and also how you\u2019ve presented this. The only thing I\u2019d suggest she change is the smoothies- either make ahead the night before or have her pick up while out on her run.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and my wife is event threatening to not allow them to stay and have them get a hotel for the visit. \" .. This is the reasonable solution: Living room, or a hotel.", "YTA \n\nYour sister is fine with the sofas for three days. \n\nThe room doesn't sound particularly better with no curtains and bare floors. \n\nHer routine is a deal-breaker to her, which means it's very important. You knew this from the start. You say you made peace with it but you clearly haven't. You quietly resent her monopoly on the space and the rigidity of her mornings.\n\nYour wife said hard no. Your sister has no issue, the sofa's seem perfectly workable for a short stay. You are the one making this an issue.\n\n I think your wife is dead on - that you are using this as an excuse to try and put a dent in this well settled equilibrium and you intend to use a forced break in her routine and use of the space to try and renegotiate the terms you pretended to accept coming into this relationship.\n\nIf you have issues with her routine or her room, then communicate with her honestly and openly. There are things that she could bend a little on, like not making smoothies so early. However stop being underhanded about it, it's not respectful, kind, or working. She's not falling for it mate and neither is anyone here..", "YTA - It\u2019s pretty clear from what you\u2019ve written that you do have an issue with your wife\u2019s routine and her use of the room for it. She was up front early in your relationship that this was a dealbreaker for her. You accepted this fact, at least outwardly to her although it seems like you were hoping it would end eventually. \n\nI do feel the smoothie thing is the only hang up I have. Her not being willing to compromise on that doesn\u2019t seem very reasonable. Maybe for those three days she could blend her smoothies the night before?\n\nHave you ever had a discussion with your wife about why she has her routine or how it developed? It does seem like kind of an extreme routine, but without knowing her reasoning for it it\u2019s hard to say.", "As someone who is currently in the throes of a deep dark depression, I feel like your wife\u2019s routine was possibly born out of absolute necessity, and that it may be the thing that keeps her functional. I would say that she was very clear to you as to how important her routine was, so I do think that YTA for wanting her to change it. I do also understand that she may be seen as non-accommodating, but it was never a secret. Sometimes things that look selfish, are more than what they seem from the outside.", "YTA for saying \"I apparently hate. I'm not sure where she got that from since I've never asked her to change it.\" because you act like never asking her to change her routine means you're not clearly and obviously seething with resentment over it. It's all over the post. Her routine is something that works for her health-wise and requires nothing from you at all except a little space (one room in a whole house). \n\nWhile it would be totally fine to change her routine for the duration of sis's visit, it's also fine to have them sleep in the living room.\n\nQuotes that show the seething resentment your wife is picking up on:\n\n\"other things that I can't disrupt her because its her personal time.

She is trying to work with you by letting them stay with y'all, but you are so desperate to interrupt a routine that is somehow bugging you that you refuse to see it. Perhaps you should ask yourself WHY you are so resentful of this routine? Is it because it is HER time with herself and she isn't paying attention to you? Or because you are jealous that you don't have that same dedicated time allotted for you to have you time? Look at yourself, and figure it out soon.", "YTA. Seems like this is just an excuse to force her to stop something that makes her happy.", "YTA, respect her my gosh. Who cares if she has this routine? Make a routine for yourself instead of feeling the need to disrupt hers.", "YTA. Sounds like your wife made the importance of her routine plain to you a long time ago. They can sleep in the living room. How long does it take to make a smoothie? They can go back to sleep. And like you said, it\u2019s only 3 days. Your sister and her kid will live. I get that you want to cater to your guests, but you\u2019re doing them a favor and I don\u2019t think your wife should have to sacrifice more than necessary on top of that.", "Dude. You knew all this before you got married and now you're acting surprised that *she actually meant it*?\n\nYeah, YTA.

Personally, I think it\u2019s pretty balanced right now. She made it clear what matters to her when you got together. \u201cMaking your peace with it\u201d doesn\u2019t count for peanuts mate. \n\nit sounds like your wife is pretty clear eyed about what\u2019s going on here, and she\u2019s right on the money. i assume you married her because you liked her as she is\u2026\n\nIt looks like this is the hill that your marriage could die on - sooner or later.

Don't invade her space why is that such a hard concept? \n\nYou have a point with asking her to delay making the smoothies, especially if your guests are sleeping near where she makes them (kitchen?).

It\u2019s her room and she doesn\u2019t want to give it up for guests.  If your family wants privacy, they should shell out the money for a hotel.

Let your sister know what to expect (living room couches, early smoothie noise, etc) so she can decide whether she'd rather just hotel it.", "The only thing I think you could reasonably ask if she is open to changing is making her smoothie in the morning so early. If she is open to it, you could ask her to make it the night before and store it in the fridge overnight, just so the noise of the blender is avoided. She would still have her smoothie at the expected point in her routine, just not use the blender so early.\n\nBut if she is not open to that change, you need to warn your guests about the early morning routine and give them ample opportunity to book alternative accommodation.\n\nIf you don't warn your guests upfront then YTA for sure.", "Info: If you don't have a guest room, why not have a sofa bed, pull out of the couch?\n\nYTA for thinking of unreasonable accommodations for guests. If it were a home gym with a rower,  a Bowflex machine, a pelaton or treadmill you wouldn't be asking this question at all. You would just accept the room as a permanent home gym.

It's not a spare room, it's her space, one she has set up for years and clearly needs.", "My problem would be that she makes her smoothies so early. This wouldn\u2019t be very kind to the visitors.

This is her line, important enough to her to choose it over you, which she made clear to you prior to committing.\n\nYou are now attempting to cross that line by prioritizing your sister's temporary comfort over your wife's needs.\n\nAccept that your wife needs what she needs, and have your sister stay at a hotel.", "YTA\n\nyour wife has her life balanced in under control, why you need to brake it?

I would explain to sister what here would be an early wake up and she should prepare for that.", "YTA.\n\nThat's not a spare room. That's your wife's sanctuary. She established that very early on, and you accepted her terms when you moved in. It's not up to you to offer it to guests.", "YTA, it's her house and comfort zone. If you want your family to be comfortable then get them a hotel or warn them of the noise they will have to endure every morning.\nSounds like your partner has some mental issues though, I would easily put up with change for guests for a few days which is an event that almost never happens so maybe reconsider your relationship if you want change", "I feel some type of way about this situation. Your wife has a whole room to herself, as well as half of the office space, and half of your bedroom space. Everyone keeps saying that it\u2019s her house and her space, but just because op moved into her house doesn\u2019t mean she should continue to live like he doesn\u2019t exist in that space either.

I am sorry you have such an inflexible selfish wife.", "NTA. Hosting people for a few days is a normal thing to do, disrupting your routines slightly for the sake of said guests' comfort and privacy is a normal thing to do. Being completely unable to make noble very short term changes is not normal. It's selfish. Just because she \"communicated her boundaries\" ahead of time doesn't make those boundaries reasonable in perpetuity. Rigidity and being rude to guests (to the point of refusing to host family that isn't making unusual demands) are bad manners, not boundaries. If she has mental health reasons for needing to do things this way and legitimately being unable to ever adjust, then maybe she should have communicated about those details by now.\n\nYoga and journaling can be done in other locations.

This is normal when we spend time w/ friends and family in our home.  We put our best selves 'out there' in hopes of it being an awesome visit.\n\nThe room she uses on the daily is only for her needs? It's fine if you both agree but accommodating guests for 72 hrs. out of 365 days in this room is what most people would do. She seems oblivious or simply does not care about her early rooster crowing smoothie. Is she normally unaware of others or is something else going on? (serious).  The outcome of disagreements are sometimes not as valuable as how we treat one another through the process.  Best to you!", "Kind of TA, a bit, yeah.

I am a creature of habit too but that is not an excuse for rudeness. She needs to work through her issues in therapy. Dominating an environment and being unable to care for others is a big issue.

He's not a guest, it's his his home as well as hers. And of course that doesn't give him permission to run roughshod over her established routines, but the fact that she is so inflexible about them is confusing and a little concerning. \n\n\n\nThe spare room for example. She uses it for her morning yoga/meditation/etc. That's great, but is the room only used for that? Getting a total use of, let's say an hour each morning? If she only uses it for her morning routine, why can't he have his PC in there to use in the evenings or afternoons? \n\n\n\nIf she is unable to deviate from this routine to the point of not being able to do her morning yoga in a different room for a few days, how does she cope when they travel? Do they travel? She's obviously able to manage adjusting it to some degree, because I doubt she goes running if there a thunderstorm or blizzard. \n\n\n\nAnd as far as secretly hating her routine, we all have things about our partners that we simply tolerate. My partner has a genuinely terrible singing voice. Like, sounds like dying animal level of talent. And yet they love to sing in the shower at the top of their lungs. Do I enjoy it? No. But I put in my headphones and drown it out because it helps them unwind. I don't secretly resent them and try to figure out how to discourage them from singing.\n\n\n\nI hate to pull out the \"if the genders were reversed\" card because I think it's usually bullshit, but I think it applies here. Wife marries husband and moves into his house. Husband say this is *my house* and nothing is changing unless he agrees. Wife has to use the dining room for her hobby (maybe for her home office space? It was unclear) because the spare bedroom can only be used for Husband's morning routine and she can't do anything in there even when he's not using it. Now her family is coming to visit for a few days and they have to sleep on couches because the only room big enough for an air mattress is his special morning routine room. Wife suggested his routine be adjusted for a few days and now Husband is threatening that her family can't stay at *his house* at all.

She afforded it before you, she'll afford it after you.  Given her routine, letting your sister stay in the living room is a compromise to her", "Mate, you're living the dream! Most people struggle with paying rent, let alone buying their own home.. You're gonna be back to square one if you keep pushing buttons, or maybe that's what you want so your wife has to give you half", "What A Coincidence that you can't offer any of your stuff.", "Alright why not make space? Shove your desk against the wall, or take it out and stick it in the closet/bedroom. Stick the air mattress down in there. Problem solved. Your family will get the comfort and privacy you think they should have. \n\nIf that seems unreasonable, disruptive, inconvenient, you have to ask yourself why you expect it of your wife? It's your family you are hosting for 3+ days after all. Go out of your own way, disrupt your own space, routines and privacy if you think the sofas they already said they're fine with are such an issue.", "Well, she can make them later during the day, then, when everybody is already awake. Two hours delay isn't going to significantly disrupt her metabolism.", "It is. It's also got sentimentality to her and I wouldn't dream of taking it anyway in a hypothetical divorce", "Wait...Why can't she yoga in the office for a few days? I presume you won't be using it as an office at 5 a.m.? And why did you have to move your computer from the dining room into \"her\" room if there is an office?", "One exclusively for gaming and another for my work life and miscellaneous things", "In my experience, depends what you mean by an air mattress. I slept on a double-height queen-sized air mattress for years, by choice. \n\nThe right ones, inflated to the right level, are, I found, pretty comfy. The biggest downside is if you're in a cold environment you need to have insulation under you as well as on top, b/c air insulates a lot less than a conventional mattress.", "I would rather sleep on a bare floor than an air mattress. They're torture devices.", "Running a predawn blender with guests over is just rude. An inability to change your routine for guests is not healthy. She could blend her drinks the night before.", "The things she does just seem like normal things in combination with being a morning person so I never pushed it. I think I will ask though seeing some comments about it", "Jesus, can you imagine MARRYING someone and then pulling some \"my house, my rules\" shit once you've moved in together like they're a shitty parent?  You're supposed to be sharing your damn life.\n\nI do shit I don't want to do all the time for my partner, and he does for me.  Y'all are wild.", "They are married - Is he supposed to consider himself a visitor in the house forever? \n\nIt may have been her house when he moved in, but at this point, I\u2019d say it\u2019s *their* house.", "Tbh doesn\u2019t sound like OP has much space/stuff since his computer is at the dining room table.", "I don't have any space to offer them bar the living room and the office", "Its not the same though because there's so much empty room in there and I just need to put down airmattresses. In the office, I would have to dismantle the desks, move tables as well as unplug and unwire the PCs", "You're VERY generous with somebody else's house.\n\nOP already agreed to this when told IT WAS A DEALBREAKER.", "She could make them the night before and then she gets her smoothie and doesn\u2019t have to wake up the living room. Seems like a win win. Or she could take the blender into her yoga space and do it there where it would probably be a bit quieter.", "Her workout space has a ton of natural light as well as mirrors which is why she is hesitant to use the office. She thinks the wires and desks are cluttering and she wants to do her yoga in her room because its very minimalist.\n\nI have 2 PCs, one exclusively for gaming and the other is for work and other miscellaneous things. My desk in the office does not have enough space to house both PCs so I have a small desk in a nook in the dining room for it", "Computers are smallish objects, and two computers can share monitors. This is all about asserting your ego.", "Wait, if you have an office with two PCs, why is there a third PC in the dining room that you tried to put in your wife\u2019s room?", "My air mattress is more comfortable than most high quality beds.", "My girl sucks my dick. Any reasonable request from her is done in a timely manner", "It's her house when they met. He lives with her and they get married. Eventually, he says he wants to change one of their agreements as he feels it is his house too now. She says no. From a legal perspective, he has no leg to stand on. So if he feels like she's being unfair and doesn't respect him, then he needs to leave and meet someone he has more in common with. She isn't gonna budge and he doesn't live in a time where he can enforce his power on his woman to make her conform to his wishes so he only has 2 options: stfu and appreciate what he's got or go and get something better", "Only because he said he can\u2019t fit 2 PCs in his portion of the office.  Sounds like he\u2019s talking about a big gaming set up\u2026. So he really wanted her meditation/yoga room to turn into his gaming room oof", "Exactly, because its not your house. If you don't like it, move.", "That shouldn\u2019t be a problem. It\u2019s *only* 3 days, right?", "Only if you think drinking a congealed glass of slime sounds appetizing.", "NTA but your wife sounds insufferable OP. and selfish.\nwaiting an hour or two or three to use a blender is absolutely a reasonable request.", "That still doesn\u2019t make him a guest in the home. My wife bought a house before I moved in. It\u2019s her name on the mortgage. She still doesn\u2019t try to hold it over my head and play the \u201cIt\u2019s *my* house\u201d card because that\u2019s shitty for partners to do.", "No but its a considerable amount more of work compared to just using the workout yoga room", "OP married her AFTER she had made the boundary plain.\n\nAnd it's HER HOUSE.\n\nOP is perfectly welcome to take their attitude, sibling, and niece elsewhere.", "Why is the wife insufferable? Why does she have to give up her routine and her space when the office and the STORAGE ROOM aren't in use? \n\nHubby could just move some boxes and let his family stay in the OTHER TWO ROOMS", "Because you got with a loving and reasonable person. OP has married a nightmare. He literally is a guest in HER home. That's why he only has 2 options, stay and be a guest until he possibly outlives her and inherits her house or leave and upgrade his wife and life. If she acts this way about her house then imagine how she will be when she gives birth to their kids and acts like they're her kids.
