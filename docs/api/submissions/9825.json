It really sounds like she's not even going shopping or much else", "He also claims he does 90% of the work, but doesn't mention anything about cleaning of any sort, waking up with the kids at night or organizing schedules, so I'm thinking he might think he does more than he is actually doing.", ">As far as I can tell, she spends about 25% of her income on work/friend functions, maybe 30-35% on clothes for herself and the kids, and the rest on the packages that arrive on my porch almost daily.\n\nI think the answer is in whatever is in the packages that show up daily. Is it fun stuff for her? Or is it diapers, wipes, sippy cups, and everything else babies and children need all the time? It's probably a mix of the two. Can you talk to her about it, and try to get a better picture of what's coming? Keep in mind, you may find that all the stuff is necessary. And unfortunately, with a 3rd kid and the way inflation has been, it may be that being in the same place financially were 5 years ago is unavoidable. But, it's better to ask than stay in the dark and resent.", "There\u2019s just no way children\u2019s clothes and 150 usd adds up to anything remotely close to all of the either bills - rent/mortgage, electricity, groceries, insurance etc.", "Sorry, clothes every month? Where do you live Beverly Hills?\n\nWith three kids and some of them school aged, you can easily go shopping once per season. Maybe even half a year, especially with the younger ones who use their sibling's clothes.", ">Bear in mind that you likely climbed the career ladder in order to be able to make the extra money thanks to your wife taking care of the kids at home, and perhaps she feels she could have been making more but has taken the hit in her wages thanks to her sacrifice\n\nThis is an often overlooked fact.\n\nMay or may not apply to this situation, but certainly an important thing to point out.", "Interesting that you called it kid drop off and pick up. What does that typically involve for you? Getting the kids up in the morning, getting them bathed, dressed, fed, lunch made, school bags packed, homework done, loaded up in the car and dropped at school? \nOr loaded up in the car and dropped at school? \n\nI ask because other comments have interpreted your comment as \"doing 90% of childcare\" and it seems unclear if that's the case.", "It definitely hit the wifes AH meter hard for sure", "It's kind of funny because I'm basically in the exact same situation as the OP, only with the genders reversed and instead of clothes my partner occasionally pays small house maintenance bills (like when he drilled into the wiring and had to call in a professional or when we had the gutters cleaned, stuff like that), i do 99% of the household chores and 80% of the childcare.\n\nAnd I always think if I posted here about this people would grasp at any possible straw to justify why that's fair, because he works more hours or the house is in my name, etc etc.\n\nAnd that's exactly what's happening here \ud83d\ude05 \nSome of it is certainly gender bias but some is also just people being aware that people only ever post things from their perspective and of course, try to make themselves look good.", "I've seen posts where the roles were reversed and nobody was looking for \"more to the story\". It seems obvious that OP's wife is a deadbeat wife. She insisted to keep their finances separated and now barely contributes not only financially but to the domestic chores as well. It would be fair that they split the bills proportionally to their salary, and split the chores proportionally to the hours they work. It shouldn't be that hard.", "Federal & state income tax should be taken out of her paycheck. How is he paying that?", "he enumerated everything he does for them, if he pays for the clothes he would have said it too. they have weird thing with finances that they should be talking one on one about instead of running to reddit and giving bits of info per post per comment.", "If the husband here takes care of every expense except (at least some) clothes for the children, you think that adds up to a fair split of 1:1,7 of expenses?", "Probably not as op doesnt know what arrives in those. He says he does 90% of the housework so he does spend time at home which should mean he would atleast know what arrives in those if it was for the family", "What, so OP can pay for that along with the hundred other things he pays for?", "What, he\u2019s the AH for wanting them to contribute according to their respective incomes? That\u2019s insane. Of course he should pay more, but she should pay some of it. They could go for say\u20261:1.7.", "She\u2019s treating her money as her money, but his money as their money. I think that\u2019s wild.", "So he should suffer unfair treatment to avoid divorce? Be honest would you say the same to a lady?", "You are part of the problem.", "They\u2019re married with children. Most likely they file together, not separately. It\u2019s THEIR income taxes, not his and hers", "They never take enough out.

Cut back on cooking daily and split it evenly. If she won't contribute financially, let her contribute to the running of the home. Let the cleaner go and agree on a roster. NTA.", "Teacher here! She likely lost a lot on maternity leave. I lost 45,000 for my three leaves.", "But why is he the only one paying?", "I mean in the comments someone guessed she planned to run away. \n\nMy guess is if they ever divorce she won't be affected.", "Would you care to explain how his previous comment led to you assuming \u201cso she\u2019s doing the majority of the childcare\u201d?", "Why are you trying so hard to find ways to make him an asshole?    It\u2019s ok.  The wife IS an asshole sometimes.", "right? he had a housekeeper but he does 90% of the chores. 90% of her income is disposable for her but she spends 30-35% for her clothes and the kids'.", "Because the rent is a fixed amount, so we put in a fixed amount. Bills includes utilities, which can be eye watering in summer or winter. So we put in a fixed amount but also top it up if we have a little extra.", "That's only if there are assets to divide.\nMy ex husband blew all of our money on beer and video games and then accused me of spending all of his hard earned money. \n\n\nSeperate finances are a smart move.", "I\u2019m in the UK and I don\u2019t know anyone who has one account for both incomes. I think joint accounts for bills etc is common but your salary goes into your own account, you transfer/set up a standing order each month to the shared account either 50/50 or split proportionally based on earnings, but then everything else is yours. That way you both are contributing but also have \u2018your own\u2019 money too, which is important.", "Check op\u2019s account, they mention it", "This is a very fair take. I hope OP reads it.", "This is such a dumb take", "Did you miss the comment where OP said that his wife is a teacher and is on the highest possible pay level for her profession?", "Her career didn't stall because of their third child; it stalled because she's a teacher and maxed out in her career ladder.

For us, income goes into the shared pot. Everything is paid out of it. We have a set \u2018pocket money\u2019 monthly amount where no questions are asked, you want whatever, go get it! Beyond that amount we talk about the purchase together. Mainly me going \u2018are you sure we need that rpg book? Haven\u2019t we got enough to be going on with?\u2019 And him asking \u2018do you really need more fabric right now?\u2019 (Don\u2019t stash shame\u2026) But mostly it\u2019s about looking at our budget and whether we are impulse buying because we are having a bad day, or there really is a case for whatever. It works for us and keeps the things we get irritated about confined to things like toilet paper orientation.", "Because for how long is she going to use that excuse?
