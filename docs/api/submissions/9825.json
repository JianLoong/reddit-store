I don't think they have a hope in Hell of making this work.", "Sounds like couples therapy might do you both good. She's working 11-12 hour days and your travelling for work. On top of 3 kids. It sounds like it might be time to reevaluate what family life should look like.", "So you clean the house, care for the kids, do the laundry as well?", "He commented multiple other places that she pays for things for the kids.  It's not like she isn't paying for anything.  She likely is paying for more things than he realizes and she is just sick of his crap.  Also, if everyone quit teaching because it's a crappy job, then society in general will have much bigger problems.", "That's probably true in some cases.  In this situation, he is making much more money than she is, and she is helping with the children's expenses.  I personally think it's weird to keep finances separate, and if they had them together, this likely wouldn't even be an issue.", "Literally no one said it was hers alone lol", "Stuff like this is why you couldn't pay me to have a child. His career went full speed ahead while hers got punished for having a child. She's paying all kinds of bills in loss of earnings and use of her physical body for reproduction", "Equality is about to mean women work and have no more babies. That's perfectly fine by me but men seem to be quite interested in spreading their seed", "No, it means they\u2019re both ridiculous for having separate finances but shared kids.", "Yeah wtf why r they arguing about who pays the electric bill, they have 3 children and 20 years together", "No she should know have to contribute. Period the end.", "He's climbing the corporate ladder. We're not talking about a poor or lower middle income situation. Also, your dad doing it to your mom really doesn't mean that's something you should aspire to. You should actually have a conversation with her about how it impacts her and whether or not she'd do it again before you make your decision about how great it is", "Oh baby, I'm a *proud* misandrist but that has nothing to do with this response, lol", "Many couples don't combine finances. This strategy works well, even for people with individualistic mental accounting.", "Yep. With my job being mostly remote, I can work 6:30am-5:30pm daily with no commute. This allows me to tackle the hectic nature of my job AND still have enough time to drop off and pick up the kids, so groceries, make dinner, spend time with the kids, help with homework. \n\nObviously not the purpose of this thread, but reclaiming the wasted time on the daily commute is a GAME CHANGER in having both a busy career and a balanced home life\u2026", "So are carpenters. And plumbers. And trash collectors. Should their spouse subsidize the entire family so that they can keep all of the income (minus buying clothing, which is the expense OP\u2019s wife has taken on, and unless it\u2019s all designer it\u2019s absurd to think it covers a significant percentage of her income), and just suck it up because they\u2019re filling a valuable role in society?", "So, not even like, an easy one, like Hulu?", "People shouldn't expect their partners to pay 99% the bills, if you end up being with the wrong person they can take advantage of that and restrict you from everything. \n\nMaybe 50/50 is not realistic. But if both are living in the same house, both are working, both are using the things in the house, both are contributing to more expenses, BOTH should pay. Maybe do it like 70/30, 60/40, 80/20. Adjust it if someone gets paid less.\n\nI had this conversation w my mom millions of times and I know it affects her because I have to help her make her monthly budget.", "It has everything to do, that's why I could tell you're a misandrist just from your two comments. Plus, imagine how idiotic you have to be to take pride on discriminating a group of people.", "Oh baby, sounds *good.* Whatever you 'say'. It's great that you *own* your 'shit'.", "So initially you say you both work out of the home and now you don't? Something sounds off here.", "Istg humanity is going to go extinct. Women pay their own bills all the time. This post is specifically about a *wife and mother*. If men want to be glorified roommates instead of partners who pick up slack for things they cannot do physically and/or are unwilling to do in terms of household responsibility, that's fine but there will be far less children. That's just a fact", "Women should seriously just stop having kids for a generation and treat men like roommates complete with chore lists. There's nothing sadder than the way everything women contribute to homes has been completely erased and seen as just necessary extra work. This equality thing needs *way* more work", "It truly doesn't. You just run around the internet attacking women. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being a misandrist in a *patriarchy*. The vast majority of men are misogynists (like yourself). The only difference between us is I own my shit.", "Men can't be discriminated against on the basis of their gender because men aren't oppressed like women have been for millenia. Hope that helps.", "...you do not understand sarcasm. This is embarrassing", "what about Spotify?", "Well if both live in the same house both should contribute to the chores and bills. It's not that hard. \n\nWhen u live alone, you do your chores. When you were in your house as a child you also did. When you go to college you also have to do it. Why now that you have a partner you can't? You just split the chores and that's it", "So gross.", "This is literally the first comment I made on Reddit. If you lived in Afghanistan I would agree that there's a patriarchal society in the country but that's most likely not the case. What's even the basis of your generalisation that most men are misogynists? Independently, consider yourself reported.", "It didn't help because LaundryMusic just claimed to be misandrist thus admitting that there's discrimination against men coming from her.", "Hahaha you are hilarious.\n\nBut for real though, married for 20 years, 3 kids together and he needs wife to \u201cpay for spotify\u201d or whatever to prove her loyalty? This is a bit absurd.", "I own a house and live alone. This is why I rarely allow men in it. If you've never lived with a man and/or paint a rosey picture about it, I can understand but it's truly not all it's cracked up to be. The weaponized incompetence is *real*", "...talk to me when we have a woman president and a reasonable percentage of congress. As long as men are massively stealing unearned power and control, women saying mean things online is *truly* a non issue", "We've never had a woman president. Congressional representation for women is nowhere near equal. Men are literally outlawing abortion. Child marriage is perfectly legal almost everywhere. Rapes and murders of women by men are quite high. The misogyny and patriarchy are not debatable.", "Right, because one (1) woman's opinion is going to cause all men in the world to suffer and get fired from their jobs for being men and get financially and physically abused by woman. Grow a thicker skin", "maybe Audible?", "I live with two men in my house. I wash the dishes, my brother washes the dishes and cleans the bathroom, my dad takes care of the cars and other stuff.\n\nIt's about balance. If men in your life can't do that, meet better people. Sex has nothing to do with your ability to do basic human skills.", "Women outnumber men.  Take it up with them on why they aren't voting for women.\n\nYour comments are pretty disgusting.  Your belief that you can be that way because others have been wronged is also disgusting.", "Now changing the argument to a pathetic slippery slope. Grow a brain.", "Men can be discriminated. You're not a man, stop acting like their experience is not valid."]}
