But for reasons at the time (mainly our children), we decided to continue the marriage until our children left home. \n\nBasically nothing has changed on a daily basis, we were* still the same couple as always, but we didn't force something we didn't want. \n\nWhen Michael moved away for college and home permanently (at age 19) we decided to make the gradual move and finally make our divorce official. \n\nMichael didn't handle it well. For months he tried to convince us to try couples therapy, \"intervention\", that it was a bad phase in the marriage and not to sign the divorce paper until we were sure. \n\n\nWe explained together, separately that it wasn't a bad phase and that we stayed together for the good of the family only, etc. Over time, he conformed (but hasn't  accepted until today). \n\nI am currently married and so is Natalia. We have a great relationship and often spend Christmas and New Year's together with our children. \n\nWhat happened: \n\nMichael is engaged to Liam and we recently had dinner with him, his in-laws, fiance and Natalie to celebrate the engagement.\n\n Michael still has a habit of making spiteful comments about the divorce and how traumatizing his parents' experience of getting divorced was. Several times, I said that this was something that hurt us to hear, because above all, my ex and I cherish that our children don't suffer from our decision. \n\nDuring dinner, we were talking to his in-laws and they asked how long we'd been apart and how good we had a relationship etc. \n\nMichael at some point, said: \"It wasn't such a good thing for the family, it was a traumatizing experience to see your inspiration as a couple break up and your family fall apart\".\n\n To say that Natalie and I were embarrassed that he said it in front of his in-laws is not necessary. \n\nI had my limit and I said \"Look, Mike, I understand your feelings, but it's been 9 years that your mother and I haven't been together and you didn't even live with us during this process. We are already in another moment of our lives. I think it's over time to get over it and turn the page\". \n\nHe was quiet and stayed that way for most of dinner, saying only what was necessary. \n\nLater, I got a text from him criticizing me saying I should respect his feelings and he was just venting which was a valid thing and I shouldn't say that  in front of his in-laws. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673709065, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bqp92/aita_for_telling_my_son_to_get_over_the_divorce/", "score": 593, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What your son was doing was criticizing you in front of his future in\u2013laws. That's not right, and you were very gracious in the manner in which you corrected him. NTA.", "NTA...venting at such an  event is not appropriate. He should seek the help he needs if he still can't accept the situation.  You have a right to your own happiness and you've made every effort to make the situation work.", "NTA. It wasn't appropriate dinner conversation, but he brought it up first. 9 years is a really long time to not be able to adjust to a change made when he was an adult. Have you ever explained to Michael that you and your ex were only staying together for the kids for most of his life? He can't just attack you about a decade old divorce every time you interact with him, that's ridiculous.", "So your son is a hypocrite and doesn't even care... \n\nYou have to respect HIS feelings, but he doesn't have to respect yours. \n\nYOU shouldn't say anything in front of his in laws but HE can.\n\nYour son has some growing up to do.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's been 9 years - more than enough time to recover from it. He needs to see a therapist and work out his feelings if he's truly still upset by it.", "Michael has the right to be upset about the divorce, but it doesn't look like he's trying to work through it. And it's mighty hypocritical of him to make the snide comment in front of the in-laws, playing if off as venting, and then objecting to you talking back about it. NTA", "NTA you seemed to handle the divorce as well as one can be handled and you are 100% correct. He needs to get over it.", "NTA Michael was an adult and living elsewhere when you divorced and he\u2019s an adult now. He can get therapy to cope. You and Natalia don\u2019t need to stay stuck in one spot to please your adult child. It\u2019s quite funny to me that he called you out for saying those things in front of his in-laws but he actually started that by saying things in front of his in-laws. Like?? The delusion. He\u2019s an adult. He can get therapy.", "NTA.  You can't revolve the rest of your life and your relationships around him. He is a grown man and him criticizing you is not helping you or him.   Sounds like he needs therapy to grieve and process the divorce and come to terms with it.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s an adult and can vent in the presence of a professional.", "NTA Michael needs to understand the sacrifice you and your ex made for his stability. It\u2019s painful to stay in a marriage that isn\u2019t whole and everyone deserves happiness. You found it in your current relationship, he needs to respect that and get over it.", "NTA\n\nMichael needs to give his head a wobble.", "NAH. I fully believe you and your wife have viewed this divorce as amicable and are content with how it went but I think you maybe need to acknowledge that events can be perceived very differently by others. \n\nHave you asked him about that? Not in a way where you'd immediately come back to counter any of his feelings on it. What about Lily, how has she reacted and how do Lily and Michael talk about this?", "NTA. Sounds like they should heed their own advice and he shouldn\u2019t have said those things in front of his in-laws.", "NTA.  He's a hypocrite for pretending that he wasn't being rude and disrespectful and then acting the victim when rebuffed.  He was an adult and out of the house when you divorced.  Both you and your ex have moved on and are in new relationships.  It's time that he grows up and accepts that.", "Nta", "NTA. Respect works both ways and he has no respect for the decision that you and Natalie made", "NTA. Not for the specifics of the situation, but your son seems intent on openly judging you and your ex for doing what was best for each other. He doesn\u2019t even complain about the time you spent together, so it\u2019s not like he grew up miserable.\n\nSince the divorce was amicable and you are still friends, you are correct that your son needs to get over it. He\u2019s allowed to have his feelings, those feelings don\u2019t justify him taking out his frustrations on you.", "NTA.\nYou stayed together and stayed happy even if you weren't in love until it no longer affected his day to day life.

But I keep my mouth shut because they\u2019re adults, I don\u2019t even live in the same state, and they can do whatever makes them happy. NTA", "NTA \n\nHe's allowed to have his feelings but he's being very selfish about it. Also more than a little naive. He should speak to people whose parents had horrific divorces and see how lucky he is that his parents love and respect one another. All that's different is that it's not romantic love.", "Nobody wins here. The parents kept an amicable relationship to keep a family unit together, which is essentially a lie. They waited until the children had left the home before divorcing, and their younger son has taken it badly.\n\nSo the parents need to acknowledge that the son can feel betrayed, or a myriad of other feelings And they should acknowledge it instead of glossing over with we did what was best for you.\n\nBut the son needs to realize that his parents acted out of what they believed was the best intent for him and his sister. Would it have been better had they gotten divorced when he was still in school?  Then it would\u2019ve been shuttling back-and-forth from home to home, split custody, birthdays, holidays, etc. Or does he just want them to stay together forever in the big lie so that he can be happy?\n\nBut either way, this boy needs some therapy or counseling or way to work through this because it\u2019s gonna call her every relationship he has. He will always be waiting for betrayal and the anger he feels towards his parents is going to manifest itself in some unhealthy way.", "NTA. You guys are able to make your own decisions, you waited until it didn't impact their day to day lives, and it was amicable. A lot of time has elapsed. Perhaps he has an issue related to something else in his life/childhood and he's making it about the divorce as a coping mechanism. I can see being upset your parents are not together but when there is no fighting, bitterness and terrible comments toward the ex that the kids can see,  I can't see it being traumatizing. He's saying staying together and slowly dissolving impacted his youth but he also tried to convince you to stay together at the time. So which of those two conflicting things is he upset with? You need to live your lives and it sounds like your divorce was better for the kids than 99.9% of all divorces in history.", "I mean he is entitled to feel that way- you can\u2019t decide for him not to be traumatized by the divorce. What you should have done is sit down and have an honest discussion since he\u2019s been making comments like that repeatedly. Keep in private and in the family. Instead you took a stand in front of his in laws.", " ESH. You both have the right to your feelings. Mike clearly was traumatized by the divorce. However, the passive aggressive comments are unnecessary and his timing was inappropriate. He needs therapy to work through this.\n\nIt's great that you and your ex have moved on so easily,  but being dismissive of your son's feelings really sucks, no matter how bad his timing happened to be. You need to apologize immediately and see what you can do to help rectify the situation. Offer to pay for a few therapy sessions, maybe?", "NTA. There\u2019s a time and place for his venting about your divorce, and the dinner wasn\u2019t the time or place. He could benefit from therapy as this sounds traumatic for him and could hold him back. \n\nIt sounds like you handled things during dinner and the divorce itself maturely. Bravo.", "NTA. Divorce is going to be a difficult pill to swallow for everyone involved but your son has so many advantages-he\u2019s grown, both of his parents get along still, you and your ex-wife worked very hard to make it as easy for your children as you possibly could. It would be one thing for you to have told him to get over it as soon as the papers were signed (you would have been TA for that) but he made a big deal about it at a group gathering years after the divorce. \n\nHe really does need to get over it enough to not make it uncomfortable for everyone at group functions.", "NTA.\nYou stayed together and stayed happy even if you weren't in love until it no longer affected his day to day life. You're still friends and to me it basically sounds like the family hasn't even been split up.\nDon't know how much you explained the reasons to him but even then, he's an adult, he was an adult when it happened, and what happened basically happened in the best way it could have between you and your ex.\n\nUnlike what other people here seem to think, how you handled it at dinner was fair enough and reasonable.\nYoure not an asshole for your adult son choosing to be bitter about the situation with seemingly no effort to understand or empathise with the sacrifices you and your ex made to let him have a happy childhood without being in a broken home.\nYou don't need to validate his feeling on it, and it's incredibly hypocritical of him to get angry at you for saying your side of things in front of the in laws when he thinks it's fine for him to tell his in laws how awful you and your ex are.", "Nta. He was old enough to understand it wasn\u2019t go work & still tried to force y\u2019all then. 9 years later he\u2019s still doing it.", "ESH. Of course this was an inappropriate time to try to name his feelings about your divorce. But do you really not understand that divorce is very often traumatizing for children/adult children even when it\u2019s the best decision for the parents? \n\nIf you hadn\u2019t spent years telling your son her shouldn\u2019t have very normal feelings, it certainly wouldn\u2019t have come out this way. Your son is responsible for processing his own feelings, but you should at least not go around telling him he\u2019s wrong to have them.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA. If he said it as exactly as you wrote, he was telling his feelings of how he felt. His experience is valid in this, because he had an idea of marriage that you personally allowed to develop. He didn't criticise you or degrade you as a parent. He said that the idea that he had of marriage obviously wasn't what was reality. You allowed him that.  \n\nThen you insulted him personally and will probably wonder why he seems more distant with you in the future. You told him to get over it. \n\nAnd the people saying the son is T.A. at 19 for the core memory this created are probably defending the 16 year old in another thread. At 19, you and your ex devastated your child and he's allowed to express that. Especially if he didn't personally insult you.", "NTA. Your son is allowed to feel however he feels, but there\u2019s a time and place to bring it up. Like therapy. \n\nImo he needs to make strides to move on. Lots of parents get divorced. Mine did when I was 14 and I would never hold that against them \u2014 it was the best thing for them", "ESH\n\nMichael because if this is still bothering him 9 years later he should seek therapy rather than make passive -aggressive comments. However, he is right in his feelings that your choices destroyed his example of a healthy relationship because:\n\nYou and your Ex: You lied to your children for over a decade. Rather than dealing with the consequences of ending the marriage you pretended that everything was okay. You quite literally gave Michael a false sense of security and then the instant he was out of the house ripped that security away and you refuse to take responsibility for that", "NAH\n\nYour point of view is valid, and so is your son's.\n\nThe mask of a perfect relationship is what got you here. Because you pretended to be a couple since your children were 10yo (even if you were just friends), your children never imagined you'd get a divorce. They looked at you as the ideal and perfect marriage. \n\nThe divorce came as a huge shock, and unfortunately your son isn't over it yet. He could use a therapist to help him. \n\nIt's usually easier when the children see the obvious, that the parents don't understand eachother. Occasion fighting, obviously not a perfect marriage. The divorce doesn't come as a shock then.", "INFO While I believe his feelings are valid, did you ask why he felt he could say things in front of his in-laws, but you couldn\u2019t?", "Your son feels lied to and betrayed. His entire childhood feels like a lie to him. Everything he had in his mind for what his adult life would look like in regards to his family of origin was destroyed. \n\n He needs to go to therapy and you need to realize that this is just as real to him today as they first day you split up. \n\nThis is why parents should not stay together for the kids..", "Nta. \n\nVenting is a valid thing but this was not the time or place to be doing so. Also has he been carrying on like this for 9 years? It may be that he has confided in his fianc\u00e9 his version of events, in-laws also know his version of events, and he was playing his role in his version of the events at this dinner party. I don\u2019t think there is any \u2018good\u2019 way to get divorced, I think you make the best of the situation, which is kinda sounds like you guys as parents did. \n\nDoes he feel it wasn\u2019t addressed enough back in the day and has never gotten over it?? Not sure what he identifies as his exact trauma is. That is now for him to deal with as an adult, 9 years later, and you can offer to help in any way possible. He now had two sets of parents and I hope y\u2019all can help this man get unstuck somehow. \n\nMy vote for NTA is because my opinion is you don\u2019t get to go snipping at people and then get upset when it\u2019s returned. What he did was not appropriate (as he seems to recognize it\u2019s not appropriate for YOU to misbehave in-front of the in-laws), and honestly? I would of also taken the opportunity to set the record straight on my own behalf.", "You could have phrased it better, but so could Michael. But NAH.", "NTA. He isn\u2019t a child. If he\u2019s still having trouble processing he should see a therapist. By your account your kids were not traumatised at all with the divorce and you and your ex-wife have had a great friendship post divorce that impacts him positively. His inability to get over it is not your problem.", "So he can say those things in front of his in-laws but you can\u2019t. \n\nNTA . While his feelings may be valid, he\u2019s still stuck in the past and trying to guilt you for it .", "Nta", "ESH. Michael needs to accept that talking to you about his feelings is never going to be productive. If he wants to talk about your divorce, he should find a therapist. You have so much invested in your version of your marriage & divorce, that nothing changed & that your kids weren\u2019t hurt by what you did, that you ignore anything that contradicts that version. Obviously, Michael did suffer, he found the divorce very hard to accept, & I suspect that rather than helping him, you just shut him down. Imagine admiring your parents & their marriage for your whole life, & then they tell you it was a sham & the last 10 years of it were a complete lie. The people you think you can trust most in the world have lied to you every day for half your life. If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s disillusioning and hurtful, then I can\u2019t imagine what you would think was a disillusionment. And your advice now - and probably then - is get over it. He will have to & also accept that you will be never be any help to him if it means admitting that anything you did was a mistake or hurt him.", "ESH\n\nMichael's spiteful comments are out of place, unhelpful, and clearly the result of not seeking therapy to work through his feelings. Whether or not he's \"gotten over it\", he's just being rude now.\n\nYou and your ex seriously fucked up, though, by staying together and it's pretty clear that you haven't acknowledged the trauma it caused your kids. For nearly a decade you modeled a lie to him. When he went off to college, you blindsided him by revealing this lie and set him up to feel guilt that you stayed in an unhappy marriage for nearly a decade on his account. This is something you need to work though and acknowledge to Michael instead of telling him to get over it.", "NTA - It\u2019s weird that he thinks it is appropriate for him to say these things in front of his in-laws but but you.", "It seems to me that there are two separate questions being judged. \n\nOne question is: was OP right to carry on in a marriage when both parties acknowledged it was \u2018over\u2019? \n\nThe other question is: was OP\u2019s son correct to vent his feelings at this dinner and was OP wrong to call him out for his behaviour? \n\nI don\u2019t think the first question is what OP wants judgement on, so I\u2019m disregarding the assholery of his actions. \n\nOn OP\u2019s actions at the dinner? NTA. \n\nMichael seems to be stuck in an \u201cinjured child\u201d script. He\u2019s 30 years old, he\u2019s about to be married himself. His inability to come to terms with the reality that his parents chose to separate is an issue for him to address with a therapist or a supportive loved one on his own, not by sniping at his parents at a celebratory dinner. He was out of line, and I don\u2019t blame his father for taking him up short.", "NTA, he is playing victim,  9 yrs later.", "NAH.\nYour son can feel how he wants, but can't force his parents to act the way he thinks is right. He is an adult and should understand that his parents are also adults who are perfectly capable of living their own lives and can't be expected to stay together just because he has a notion of relationship that doesn't fit the real world.\nYou talked to him in, apparently, a calm and polite manner, and that's all that is required. Besides, he can't get hurt to be reprimanded when he keeps on judging his parents attitude with other people", "NTA he\u2019s a grown man who doesn\u2019t care about his parents happiness", "Your son is grown he needs to act like it. It sounds like you did the best you could so it is time for him to get over it . You and your ex have feelings too.", "NTA and he needs therapy", "NTA - He may be just venting but it was inappropriate of him to vent in front of everyone. If it was in private, that would be a different matter. As someone else mentioned, he needs therapy.", "NTA If he wants to \u201cvent\u201d at a nice dinner, in front of his in laws, he has to understand that he had opened a topic and others may have something to express as well.  This is why most people try not to air their dirty laundry at nice events.", "NAH sometimes being in each other's shoes is what a situation needs", "NTA and he's an adult now.  He should be mature enough at this point to realize his idyllic picture of the \"perfect couple\" is ridiculous. And to say that during a dinner with his partner is uncalled for.  After 9 years of trying to work with him and he still has this opinion I don't think you're an asshole at all for what you said at dinner and in fact I would take him with your ex aside and have some private time with them and reiterate that you and his mom have only been friends for longer than he thinks and that his romanticized notions are imaginary.  It's time to accept the facts and move on. He's only traumatizing himself and should seek therapy if he's having this much trouble.", "I can't seem to understand what would be \"traumatic\" in your divorce just that it might be upsetting\n\nYou divorced when he was moved out so he didn't even see what it was like- even so though you split in a adult manar an it was probably pretty easy day by day\n\nHe was grown when it happened, and as you said it was 9 years ago. \n\nAs I said earlier this could be considered upsetting, but calling it traumatic is straight obsessive and honestly kinda attention seeking. \n\nYou are NTA in any way in my mind, your son however needs therapy and TBH I don't think he needs it for the divorce spesificly he needs it to manage his poor attitude and take on life as a whole", "NTA. He can have whatever feelings he wants. He needs to stop demanding that everyone's comfort be disturbed by his feelings. I think it needed to be said.", "NTA. He needs to grow up. It's ridiculous that at the age of 19 this divorce was traumatic and it was 9 years ago!", "NTA he can vent in therapy; all he's doing is holding a grudge", "Nta but this is just another reason staying together for the kids is a bad idea", "ESH - him for having this conversation in front of the in-laws and you for both continuing to have the conversation in front of the in-laws and also for invalidating his feelings. \n\nI was also a barely adult child when my parents divorced. It comes with a lot of big feelings. Kids are very perceptive and I imagine that your children picked up on the shift in your relationship long before the divorce. Also, when you tell an adult child that you stayed together for them, the child feels responsible for years of their parents\u2019 unhappiness. There are a myriad of ways to handle an amicable divorce with children, all of which are generally preferable to staying in a broken marriage \u201cfor the children.\u201d\n\nI think you need to hear your son out regardless of how painful his truth may be to hear and I also think he needs to be in therapy. His feelings about your marriage and divorce WILL affect his marriage and that\u2019s not fair to him or his future husband.", "NTA", "NTA, but it's why you shouldn't stay together for \"the sake of the kids\".

Parents that stay together \"for the kids\" make me sick to my core.", "Anyone who is staying in a marriage you want out of just because of the kids THIS IS YOUR SIGN THAT ITS NOT A GOOD IDEA.", "This is a tough one. On the one hand, you and your ex deceived your kids for almost a decade. I get how it was easy because you still liked and respected each other as people, but you need to see how hard it was for your son to realize he was deceived during a big part of his formative years. On the other hand, your son is a grown man and has had years to realize that parents are human and doing the best they can. I'm going with NAH.", "Nta, but i feel you edycated a man chuld that cant let things go after almost a decade", "Most children of divorced parents say that their parents divorce is the defining moment of their lives. It is likely the most traumatizing thing he has ever experienced. He gets to feel to that. As his parent, you should be happy that the worst thing he has ever gone through was your amicable divorce. It means the rest of life has been pretty darn good. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are the AH, but I don\u2019t think Michael is either. This was an uncomfortable situation, but not too much damage done. You were free to get divorced, but not free from the consequences of it. Children never \u201cunderstand\u201d like parents want them too. Children, regardless of age, see something they were taught was forever and permanent break. Most children never truly get over it, and those who do take decades. Practice patience with his feelings on this, and maybe agree not to talk about it in front of people. Makes perfect sense it would come up while he is planning his own wedding and future.\n\nEdit: typos", "YTA - but your kids DID suffer from your decision. Your son\u2018s view is that his entire happy childhood was a charade. He thought he was part of a happy family and learned it was a lie. \n\nHow did you expect him to react? What\u2019s the appropriate time frame for a person to get over 9 years of lying?", "YTA he\u2019s allowed to talk about his feeling and it shouldn\u2019t embarrass you. Did you ever really listen to him when your first got divorced or offer therapy? He keeps bringing it up because he doesn\u2019t feel heard. You think you did something right by staying together but you don\u2019t seem to realize while you processed the end of a relationship when they were kids, he had to process it as an adult, it sounds like he held your marriage on a peddle-stool and probably thought he always wanted that type of relationship. Your marriage was probably his version of true love. Then when he is 19 and finding out who he is and going through a big change himself you break up. It probably effected him a lot more because his idea of love had to change and that\u2019s a lot for him. It probably had him questioning a lot. He needs you and your ex wife to actually listen and get a professional to help make him process. A lot of parents think they did the right thing but like to ignore the reaction of the kids. You\u2019d rather pretend your kid is being a brat then admit maybe it wasn\u2019t the best to wait to divorce and you made a mistake.", "NTA. He was literally 19 when you split.", "NAH, truthfully the people I have known who's parents divorced like this, staying together for the kids and waiting until they leave the house to divorce seem to have the hardest time with it.

But for reasons at the time (mainly our children), we decided to continue the marriage until our children left home. \n\nBasically nothing has changed on a daily basis, we are still the same couple as always, but we didn't force something we didn't want. \n\nWhen Michael moved away for college and home permanently (at age 19) we decided to make the gradual move and finally make our divorce official. \n\nMichael didn't handle it well. For months he tried to convince us to try couples therapy, \"intervention\", that it was a bad phase in the marriage and not to sign the divorce paper until we were sure. \n\n\nWe explained together, separately that it wasn't a bad phase and that we stayed together for the good of the family only, etc. Over time, he conformed (but hasn't  accepted until today). \n\nI am currently married and so is Natalia. We have a great relationship and often spend Christmas and New Year's together with our children. \n\nWhat happened: \n\nMichael is engaged to Liam and we recently had dinner with him, his in-laws, fiance and Natalie to celebrate the engagement.\n\n Michael still has a habit of making spiteful comments about the divorce and how traumatizing his parents' experience of getting divorced was. Several times, I said that this was something that hurt us to hear, because above all, my ex and I cherish that our children don't suffer from our decision. \n\nDuring dinner, we were talking to his in-laws and they asked how long we'd been apart and how good we had a relationship etc. \n\nMichael at some point, said: \"It wasn't such a good thing for the family, it was a traumatizing experience to see your inspiration as a couple break up and your family fall apart\".\n\n To say that Natalie and I were embarrassed that he said it in front of his in-laws is not necessary. \n\nI had my limit and I said \"Look, Mike, I understand your feelings, but it's been 9 years that your mother and I haven't been together and you didn't even live with us during this process. We are already in another moment of our lives. I think it's over time to get over it and turn the page\". \n\nHe was quiet and stayed that way for most of dinner, saying only what was necessary. \n\nLater, I got a text from him criticizing me saying I should respect his feelings and he was just venting which was a valid thing and I shouldn't say that  in front of his in-laws. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It wasn't easy to get over it, but by the time I turned 20 I had more or less pushed past it.\n\nThe kid was an adult when the split happened. He was more than old enough to understand the concept of falling out of love, but he chose to try and force OP and his ex to stay together solely for his benefit.

I have no sympathy for him.\n\nNTA for both OP and the ex wife.", "Dude. The guys was in his 20s and living far away, when it happened.

It's a dinner with the in-laws, keep it civil and don't bring your family trauma into it. Saying something like that out loud in a time like this, it's only purpose is to try to stir shit, make someone look bad or *insert some negative thing here* so why an earth does someone want to have that kind of a dinner and make everyone feel awkward and bad?", "It's venting, its been nine years by this time Michael could have gotten either a therapist or a guide to read and learn time/place for saying certain stuff", "And honestly, the fact that OP and Natalie realized they were good friends, stayed together as friends until he was out of the house, and then still remain friends, probably means the poor guy never saw it coming. He probably grew up thinking his family was great, his parents were such good friends, without realizing that the romance was gone because nobody thinks about their parents' romance lives. In some ways it's probably more traumatic than a nasty divorce with fighting because at least when your parents are unhappy together you *understand* why they get divorced.", "How is it telling him his entire life was a lie? \n\nIn that case OP would be telling Michael that *OP and his mom's marriage* was a lie. Michael is an individual person and he wasn't responsible for any of their choices. Let's not merge different people's identities together.", "How would that be a lie? His parents were friends who cared for each other - that was true. They weren\u2019t Buttercup and Wesley, but who is? His behavior is pathetic, and he really needs therapy before marriage. He is not in a good place.", "> I doubt that telling him his entire life was a lie is going to help very much.\n\nHis entire life was NOT a lie. OP and his ex-wife had, and have, a great friendship.

So there is that", "Its terrible when parents love their kids so much they stay together until kids are grown.  I guess its never enough.  Every kid is traumatized by something.

The guy is 28, he needs to stop bitching at his parents and get into therapy. And let's face it, if the son's \"entire life\" is somehow built on his parents staying in a loveless marriage, he needs to get a real life. His trauma is his own responsibility, and he's failing himself by continuing to hold onto for nine years.", "I never said he made it awkward. It\u2019s the fact that he chose that specific occasion to have enough of his son\u2019s comments. Things should have been handled much earlier and not in front of in-laws.

Not saying the guy isn't traumatized, but if his sense of self requires married parents nine years after their divorce, the guy is seriously messed up.", "How should they have done this? Are you suggesting they should just have stayed together and been unhappy forever? They parented together well and broke up when their kids were out of the house. I can tell you, as a child therapist, kids are often impacted by parental divorce at younger ages, so breaking up sooner isn't a solution to this either. Even kids whose parents divorced before the kids could remember are impacted. Divorce is hard. Michael can have whatever feelings he wants about it. But the place to talk about those feelings is not at a family dinner in front of strangers. And the solution isn't to suggest parents have to stay and be unhappy.", "What should they have done? Seems to me they did the best they could to provide a stable environment. To be affected by the divorce is legitimate, but they shouldnt stay together because of an adult son who may be traumatized. He should seek therapy if it affected him so much.", "No. The issue is the lying for his childhood. Yes, divorce is difficult for a child, but at least it\u2019s honest. Studies show that children of divorced parents are happier than children who\u2019s parents stay together \u201cfor the kids.\u201d \n\n\u201cMajor long-term studies show that although many children experience short-term problems and setbacks, the vast majority rebound after a year or two. On balance, children of divorce become well-adjusted adults, as long as they have at least one loving parent who remains committed to their welfare. Far from suffering inevitable damage from divorce, children can benefit from seeing their parents decide for happiness and fulfillment.\u201d\n\nhttps://www. psychologytoday. com\n\n/us/blog/going-beyond-intelligence/201905/should-you-stay-together-only-the-kids?amp", "He\u2019s 28 and acting this way!", "Sure.

Loving parents tried to mitigate damage as much as possible.", "> Michael is the only one with an issue, nothing is said about his daughter Lily.\n\nYou should take everything that OP said with a grain of salt. Michael is the one speaking it aloud, but I'd bet money that Lily had issues as well and hopefully has worked through her feeling better.\n\nI am 100% **not** impressed that they stayed together. It does not show maturity. It shows that they did not consider the long term consequences of the facade they put up - as evidenced by Michael's resentment. It's pretty well understood that kids handle parents divorcing better the younger they (the kids) are. OP and ex did consider their children, which is good, but they made the wrong choice, caused trauma, and need to own up that that mistake.", "Lying to your kids for half their lives isn't considering the impact on them. Being lied to by parents you thought you could trust is seriously damaging to people. It isn't mature to avoid a difficult conversation for a decade and then do the hard thing when no one is around to see it.", "I agree with your comments.  They didn\u2019t fight and have big arguments so he was wholly unprepared.   However it has been 9 years and they presumably explained that they had stayed together 10 of those years, living as friends only.  He has the right to still be sad, but the stunt at dinner was disrespectful.  Dad was right for what he said.", "That\u2019s a whole lot better than a relationship that has years of pain in front of the kids. He should be over it, but if not he shouldn\u2019t be a petulant child crying in front of the in-laws just because he didn\u2019t  his parents didn\u2019t live happily ever after together", "Yep. I tell all of my friends who \u201conly stay for the children\u201d my experience. It sounds good. Sounds healthy, but it creates a laundry list of problems for the kids. Their model of marriage is their parents\u2019, so staying can really warp how the kids view what a \u201cnormal\u201d marriage looks like. \n\nThere are so many creative ways to divorce but still keep a semblance of normalcy for the kids if it\u2019s amicable. I see a lot of people buy or rent two halves of the same duplex, rent in the same apartment building, buy houses close together\u2026my dad\u2019s best friend and his ex bought houses that backed up to one another. They had a gate installed in the privacy fence and their son went back and forth as he pleased. There\u2019s no excuse for throwing \u201cwe stayed for you\u201d onto the children\u2019a shoulders.", "It was *his* engagement dinner. *His* in-laws. Sure its not something you should bring up but considering he is as you said in need of therapy we can forgive him. OP on the other hand is happy and well adjusted so he doesn\u2019t have any excuse", "Exactly.", "Or that. Either way Op is saying son isn\u2019t allowed to have any feelings on the matter besides joy", "Where did I say they should have stayed together? If anything they should have split when he was 9 so they didn't basically lie to him for 9 years. They lied about loving each other.

Doesn't matter if others have it worse. This is his life, his family. What other's endure isn't relevant to his pain. He clearly was affected more than OP realize. \n\n>It wasn't all lies\n\nNot all. No. But his parents marriage was. A lie they entertained for 9 years. Then he left and the facade crumbled. No need to endure the lie anymore. \n\nThey were loving. Sure. But how much of that is now in doubt by OP's son? How much of his life has he looked back upon - questioning if anything they did was actually honest & real. \n\nHe needs therapy, yes. OP needs to let him be. Maybe he wants nothing to do with them anymore. That's his decision. OP are not owed anything.", "So because you are a adult you can be traumatized by the fact his parents lied to him all his life about their lovely family and waited him to leave to finally show the truth!\nYeah very logic!", "The only info we have is that the divorce was an easy one for the father.", "Grown children should quietly take having their feeling dismissed by their parents forever?", "They divorced when you were four, so they weren\u2019t a lying, united front until you moved out of their house. \nThat\u2019s the biggest difference here: they maintained a facade and Michael took it at face value, as he should since they\u2019re his parents and he should trust them.", "Also, Michael was the one who brought it up first.

What exactly has this guy got to complain about? Why does this matter to/effect him? He essentially wanted his parents to stay in an unhappy situation just to placate him.

What happened was they hid this information from him - that they were in an unhappy marriage - until he was out of the house. So when they broke the news he was on his own to deal with it right when he was needing to start behaving like an adult.
