But for reasons at the time (mainly our children), we decided to continue the marriage until our children left home. \n\nBasically nothing has changed on a daily basis, we were* still the same couple as always, but we didn't force something we didn't want. \n\nWhen Michael moved away for college and home permanently (at age 19) we decided to make the gradual move and finally make our divorce official. \n\nMichael didn't handle it well. For months he tried to convince us to try couples therapy, \"intervention\", that it was a bad phase in the marriage and not to sign the divorce paper until we were sure. \n\n\nWe explained together, separately that it wasn't a bad phase and that we stayed together for the good of the family only, etc. Over time, he conformed (but hasn't  accepted until today). \n\nI am currently married and so is Natalia. We have a great relationship and often spend Christmas and New Year's together with our children. \n\nWhat happened: \n\nMichael is engaged to Liam and we recently had dinner with him, his in-laws, fiance and Natalie to celebrate the engagement.\n\n Michael still has a habit of making spiteful comments about the divorce and how traumatizing his parents' experience of getting divorced was. Several times, I said that this was something that hurt us to hear, because above all, my ex and I cherish that our children don't suffer from our decision. \n\nDuring dinner, we were talking to his in-laws and they asked how long we'd been apart and how good we had a relationship etc. \n\nMichael at some point, said: \"It wasn't such a good thing for the family, it was a traumatizing experience to see your inspiration as a couple break up and your family fall apart\".\n\n To say that Natalie and I were embarrassed that he said it in front of his in-laws is not necessary. \n\nI had my limit and I said \"Look, Mike, I understand your feelings, but it's been 9 years that your mother and I haven't been together and you didn't even live with us during this process. We are already in another moment of our lives. I think it's over time to get over it and turn the page\". \n\nHe was quiet and stayed that way for most of dinner, saying only what was necessary. \n\nLater, I got a text from him criticizing me saying I should respect his feelings and he was just venting which was a valid thing and I shouldn't say that  in front of his in-laws. \n\nAITA?\n\nEnglish is not my first language and I'm not an expert at it (google translate helped). When I said that our children didn't suffer, I mean we tried everything that wasn't the worst scenario and that they didn't suffer so much, obviously there would be \"damage\", but that it was as little as possible. Although many say it was a lie (and that's ok), it was the best scenario for several reasons as well besides the children at the time.", "created_utc": 1673709065, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bqp92/aita_for_telling_my_son_to_get_over_the_divorce/", "score": 3549, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.", "NTA...venting at such an  event is not appropriate. He should seek the help he needs if he still can't accept the situation.  You have a right to your own happiness and you've made every effort to make the situation work.", "NTA. It wasn't appropriate dinner conversation, but he brought it up first. 9 years is a really long time to not be able to adjust to a change made when he was an adult. Have you ever explained to Michael that you and your ex were only staying together for the kids for most of his life? He can't just attack you about a decade old divorce every time you interact with him, that's ridiculous.", "So your son is a hypocrite and doesn't even care... \n\nYou have to respect HIS feelings, but he doesn't have to respect yours. \n\nYOU shouldn't say anything in front of his in laws but HE can.\n\nYour son has some growing up to do.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's been 9 years - more than enough time to recover from it. He needs to see a therapist and work out his feelings if he's truly still upset by it.", "Michael has the right to be upset about the divorce, but it doesn't look like he's trying to work through it. And it's mighty hypocritical of him to make the snide comment in front of the in-laws, playing if off as venting, and then objecting to you talking back about it. NTA", "NTA you seemed to handle the divorce as well as one can be handled and you are 100% correct. He needs to get over it.", "NTA Michael was an adult and living elsewhere when you divorced and he\u2019s an adult now. He can get therapy to cope. You and Natalia don\u2019t need to stay stuck in one spot to please your adult child. It\u2019s quite funny to me that he called you out for saying those things in front of his in-laws but he actually started that by saying things in front of his in-laws. Like?? The delusion. He\u2019s an adult. He can get therapy.", "NTA.  You can't revolve the rest of your life and your relationships around him. He is a grown man and him criticizing you is not helping you or him.   Sounds like he needs therapy to grieve and process the divorce and come to terms with it.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s an adult and can vent in the presence of a professional.", "NTA Michael needs to understand the sacrifice you and your ex made for his stability. It\u2019s painful to stay in a marriage that isn\u2019t whole and everyone deserves happiness. You found it in your current relationship, he needs to respect that and get over it.", "NTA\n\nMichael needs to give his head a wobble.", "NAH. I fully believe you and your wife have viewed this divorce as amicable and are content with how it went but I think you maybe need to acknowledge that events can be perceived very differently by others. \n\nHave you asked him about that? Not in a way where you'd immediately come back to counter any of his feelings on it. What about Lily, how has she reacted and how do Lily and Michael talk about this?", "NTA. Sounds like they should heed their own advice and he shouldn\u2019t have said those things in front of his in-laws.", "NTA.  He's a hypocrite for pretending that he wasn't being rude and disrespectful and then acting the victim when rebuffed.  He was an adult and out of the house when you divorced.  Both you and your ex have moved on and are in new relationships.  It's time that he grows up and accepts that.", "Nta", "NTA. Respect works both ways and he has no respect for the decision that you and Natalie made", "NTA. Not for the specifics of the situation, but your son seems intent on openly judging you and your ex for doing what was best for each other. He doesn\u2019t even complain about the time you spent together, so it\u2019s not like he grew up miserable.\n\nSince the divorce was amicable and you are still friends, you are correct that your son needs to get over it. He\u2019s allowed to have his feelings, those feelings don\u2019t justify him taking out his frustrations on you.", "NTA.\nYou stayed together and stayed happy even if you weren't in love until it no longer affected his day to day life.

But I keep my mouth shut because they\u2019re adults, I don\u2019t even live in the same state, and they can do whatever makes them happy. NTA", "NTA \n\nHe's allowed to have his feelings but he's being very selfish about it. Also more than a little naive. He should speak to people whose parents had horrific divorces and see how lucky he is that his parents love and respect one another. All that's different is that it's not romantic love.", "Nobody wins here. The parents kept an amicable relationship to keep a family unit together, which is essentially a lie. They waited until the children had left the home before divorcing, and their younger son has taken it badly.\n\nSo the parents need to acknowledge that the son can feel betrayed, or a myriad of other feelings And they should acknowledge it instead of glossing over with we did what was best for you.\n\nBut the son needs to realize that his parents acted out of what they believed was the best intent for him and his sister. Would it have been better had they gotten divorced when he was still in school?  Then it would\u2019ve been shuttling back-and-forth from home to home, split custody, birthdays, holidays, etc. Or does he just want them to stay together forever in the big lie so that he can be happy?\n\nBut either way, this boy needs some therapy or counseling or way to work through this because it\u2019s gonna call her every relationship he has. He will always be waiting for betrayal and the anger he feels towards his parents is going to manifest itself in some unhealthy way.", "NTA. You guys are able to make your own decisions, you waited until it didn't impact their day to day lives, and it was amicable. A lot of time has elapsed. Perhaps he has an issue related to something else in his life/childhood and he's making it about the divorce as a coping mechanism. I can see being upset your parents are not together but when there is no fighting, bitterness and terrible comments toward the ex that the kids can see,  I can't see it being traumatizing. He's saying staying together and slowly dissolving impacted his youth but he also tried to convince you to stay together at the time. So which of those two conflicting things is he upset with? You need to live your lives and it sounds like your divorce was better for the kids than 99.9% of all divorces in history.", "I mean he is entitled to feel that way- you can\u2019t decide for him not to be traumatized by the divorce. What you should have done is sit down and have an honest discussion since he\u2019s been making comments like that repeatedly. Keep in private and in the family. Instead you took a stand in front of his in laws.", " ESH. You both have the right to your feelings. Mike clearly was traumatized by the divorce. However, the passive aggressive comments are unnecessary and his timing was inappropriate. He needs therapy to work through this.\n\nIt's great that you and your ex have moved on so easily,  but being dismissive of your son's feelings really sucks, no matter how bad his timing happened to be. You need to apologize immediately and see what you can do to help rectify the situation. Offer to pay for a few therapy sessions, maybe?", "NTA. There\u2019s a time and place for his venting about your divorce, and the dinner wasn\u2019t the time or place. He could benefit from therapy as this sounds traumatic for him and could hold him back. \n\nIt sounds like you handled things during dinner and the divorce itself maturely. Bravo.", "NTA. Divorce is going to be a difficult pill to swallow for everyone involved but your son has so many advantages-he\u2019s grown, both of his parents get along still, you and your ex-wife worked very hard to make it as easy for your children as you possibly could. It would be one thing for you to have told him to get over it as soon as the papers were signed (you would have been TA for that) but he made a big deal about it at a group gathering years after the divorce. \n\nHe really does need to get over it enough to not make it uncomfortable for everyone at group functions.", "NTA.\nYou stayed together and stayed happy even if you weren't in love until it no longer affected his day to day life.

He was old enough to understand it wasn\u2019t go work & still tried to force y\u2019all then. 9 years later he\u2019s still doing it.", "ESH. Of course this was an inappropriate time to try to name his feelings about your divorce. But do you really not understand that divorce is very often traumatizing for children/adult children even when it\u2019s the best decision for the parents? \n\nIf you hadn\u2019t spent years telling your son her shouldn\u2019t have very normal feelings, it certainly wouldn\u2019t have come out this way. Your son is responsible for processing his own feelings, but you should at least not go around telling him he\u2019s wrong to have them.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA. If he said it as exactly as you wrote, he was telling his feelings of how he felt. His experience is valid in this, because he had an idea of marriage that you personally allowed to develop. He didn't criticise you or degrade you as a parent. He said that the idea that he had of marriage obviously wasn't what was reality. You allowed him that.  \n\nThen you insulted him personally and will probably wonder why he seems more distant with you in the future. You told him to get over it. \n\nAnd the people saying the son is T.A. at 19 for the core memory this created are probably defending the 16 year old in another thread. At 19, you and your ex devastated your child and he's allowed to express that. Especially if he didn't personally insult you.", "NTA. Your son is allowed to feel however he feels, but there\u2019s a time and place to bring it up. Like therapy. \n\nImo he needs to make strides to move on. Lots of parents get divorced. Mine did when I was 14 and I would never hold that against them \u2014 it was the best thing for them", "ESH\n\nMichael because if this is still bothering him 9 years later he should seek therapy rather than make passive -aggressive comments. However, he is right in his feelings that your choices destroyed his example of a healthy relationship because:\n\nYou and your Ex: You lied to your children for over a decade. Rather than dealing with the consequences of ending the marriage you pretended that everything was okay. You quite literally gave Michael a false sense of security and then the instant he was out of the house ripped that security away and you refuse to take responsibility for that", "NAH\n\nYour point of view is valid, and so is your son's.\n\nThe mask of a perfect relationship is what got you here. Because you pretended to be a couple since your children were 10yo (even if you were just friends), your children never imagined you'd get a divorce. They looked at you as the ideal and perfect marriage. \n\nThe divorce came as a huge shock, and unfortunately your son isn't over it yet. He could use a therapist to help him. \n\nIt's usually easier when the children see the obvious, that the parents don't understand eachother. Occasion fighting, obviously not a perfect marriage. The divorce doesn't come as a shock then.", "INFO While I believe his feelings are valid, did you ask why he felt he could say things in front of his in-laws, but you couldn\u2019t?", "Your son feels lied to and betrayed. His entire childhood feels like a lie to him. Everything he had in his mind for what his adult life would look like in regards to his family of origin was destroyed. \n\n He needs to go to therapy and you need to realize that this is just as real to him today as they first day you split up. \n\nThis is why parents should not stay together for the kids..", "Nta. \n\nVenting is a valid thing but this was not the time or place to be doing so. Also has he been carrying on like this for 9 years? It may be that he has confided in his fianc\u00e9 his version of events, in-laws also know his version of events, and he was playing his role in his version of the events at this dinner party. I don\u2019t think there is any \u2018good\u2019 way to get divorced, I think you make the best of the situation, which is kinda sounds like you guys as parents did. \n\nDoes he feel it wasn\u2019t addressed enough back in the day and has never gotten over it?? Not sure what he identifies as his exact trauma is. That is now for him to deal with as an adult, 9 years later, and you can offer to help in any way possible. He now had two sets of parents and I hope y\u2019all can help this man get unstuck somehow. \n\nMy vote for NTA is because my opinion is you don\u2019t get to go snipping at people and then get upset when it\u2019s returned. What he did was not appropriate (as he seems to recognize it\u2019s not appropriate for YOU to misbehave in-front of the in-laws), and honestly? I would of also taken the opportunity to set the record straight on my own behalf.", "You could have phrased it better, but so could Michael. But NAH.", "NTA. He isn\u2019t a child. If he\u2019s still having trouble processing he should see a therapist. By your account your kids were not traumatised at all with the divorce and you and your ex-wife have had a great friendship post divorce that impacts him positively. His inability to get over it is not your problem.", "So he can say those things in front of his in-laws but you can\u2019t. \n\nNTA . While his feelings may be valid, he\u2019s still stuck in the past and trying to guilt you for it .", "Nta", "ESH. Michael needs to accept that talking to you about his feelings is never going to be productive. If he wants to talk about your divorce, he should find a therapist. You have so much invested in your version of your marriage & divorce, that nothing changed & that your kids weren\u2019t hurt by what you did, that you ignore anything that contradicts that version. Obviously, Michael did suffer, he found the divorce very hard to accept, & I suspect that rather than helping him, you just shut him down. Imagine admiring your parents & their marriage for your whole life, & then they tell you it was a sham & the last 10 years of it were a complete lie. The people you think you can trust most in the world have lied to you every day for half your life. If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s disillusioning and hurtful, then I can\u2019t imagine what you would think was a disillusionment. And your advice now - and probably then - is get over it. He will have to & also accept that you will be never be any help to him if it means admitting that anything you did was a mistake or hurt him.", "ESH\n\nMichael's spiteful comments are out of place, unhelpful, and clearly the result of not seeking therapy to work through his feelings. Whether or not he's \"gotten over it\", he's just being rude now.\n\nYou and your ex seriously fucked up, though, by staying together and it's pretty clear that you haven't acknowledged the trauma it caused your kids. For nearly a decade you modeled a lie to him. When he went off to college, you blindsided him by revealing this lie and set him up to feel guilt that you stayed in an unhappy marriage for nearly a decade on his account. This is something you need to work though and acknowledge to Michael instead of telling him to get over it.", "NTA - It\u2019s weird that he thinks it is appropriate for him to say these things in front of his in-laws but but you.", "It seems to me that there are two separate questions being judged. \n\nOne question is: was OP right to carry on in a marriage when both parties acknowledged it was \u2018over\u2019? \n\nThe other question is: was OP\u2019s son correct to vent his feelings at this dinner and was OP wrong to call him out for his behaviour? \n\nI don\u2019t think the first question is what OP wants judgement on, so I\u2019m disregarding the assholery of his actions. \n\nOn OP\u2019s actions at the dinner? NTA. \n\nMichael seems to be stuck in an \u201cinjured child\u201d script. He\u2019s 30 years old, he\u2019s about to be married himself. His inability to come to terms with the reality that his parents chose to separate is an issue for him to address with a therapist or a supportive loved one on his own, not by sniping at his parents at a celebratory dinner. He was out of line, and I don\u2019t blame his father for taking him up short.", "NTA, he is playing victim,  9 yrs later.", "NAH.\nYour son can feel how he wants, but can't force his parents to act the way he thinks is right. He is an adult and should understand that his parents are also adults who are perfectly capable of living their own lives and can't be expected to stay together just because he has a notion of relationship that doesn't fit the real world.\nYou talked to him in, apparently, a calm and polite manner, and that's all that is required.

He should be mature enough at this point to realize his idyllic picture of the \"perfect couple\" is ridiculous. And to say that during a dinner with his partner is uncalled for.  After 9 years of trying to work with him and he still has this opinion I don't think you're an asshole at all for what you said at dinner and in fact I would take him with your ex aside and have some private time with them and reiterate that you and his mom have only been friends for longer than he thinks and that his romanticized notions are imaginary.

He can have whatever feelings he wants. He needs to stop demanding that everyone's comfort be disturbed by his feelings. I think it needed to be said.", "NTA. He needs to grow up.

It comes with a lot of big feelings. Kids are very perceptive and I imagine that your children picked up on the shift in your relationship long before the divorce. Also, when you tell an adult child that you stayed together for them, the child feels responsible for years of their parents\u2019 unhappiness. There are a myriad of ways to handle an amicable divorce with children, all of which are generally preferable to staying in a broken marriage \u201cfor the children.\u201d\n\nI think you need to hear your son out regardless of how painful his truth may be to hear and I also think he needs to be in therapy.

It is likely the most traumatizing thing he has ever experienced. He gets to feel to that. As his parent, you should be happy that the worst thing he has ever gone through was your amicable divorce. It means the rest of life has been pretty darn good. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are the AH, but I don\u2019t think Michael is either. This was an uncomfortable situation, but not too much damage done. You were free to get divorced, but not free from the consequences of it. Children never \u201cunderstand\u201d like parents want them too. Children, regardless of age, see something they were taught was forever and permanent break. Most children never truly get over it, and those who do take decades. Practice patience with his feelings on this, and maybe agree not to talk about it in front of people.

You think you did something right by staying together but you don\u2019t seem to realize while you processed the end of a relationship when they were kids, he had to process it as an adult, it sounds like he held your marriage on a peddle-stool and probably thought he always wanted that type of relationship. Your marriage was probably his version of true love. Then when he is 19 and finding out who he is and going through a big change himself you break up. It probably effected him a lot more because his idea of love had to change and that\u2019s a lot for him. It probably had him questioning a lot. He needs you and your ex wife to actually listen and get a professional to help make him process. A lot of parents think they did the right thing but like to ignore the reaction of the kids. You\u2019d rather pretend your kid is being a brat then admit maybe it wasn\u2019t the best to wait to divorce and you made a mistake.", "NTA. He was literally 19 when you split.", "NAH, truthfully the people I have known who's parents divorced like this, staying together for the kids and waiting until they leave the house to divorce seem to have the hardest time with it.

But for reasons at the time (mainly our children), we decided to continue the marriage until our children left home. \n\nBasically nothing has changed on a daily basis, we are still the same couple as always, but we didn't force something we didn't want. \n\nWhen Michael moved away for college and home permanently (at age 19) we decided to make the gradual move and finally make our divorce official. \n\nMichael didn't handle it well. For months he tried to convince us to try couples therapy, \"intervention\", that it was a bad phase in the marriage and not to sign the divorce paper until we were sure. \n\n\nWe explained together, separately that it wasn't a bad phase and that we stayed together for the good of the family only, etc. Over time, he conformed (but hasn't  accepted until today). \n\nI am currently married and so is Natalia. We have a great relationship and often spend Christmas and New Year's together with our children. \n\nWhat happened: \n\nMichael is engaged to Liam and we recently had dinner with him, his in-laws, fiance and Natalie to celebrate the engagement.\n\n Michael still has a habit of making spiteful comments about the divorce and how traumatizing his parents' experience of getting divorced was.

Many said the divorce resulted in some sort of difficulty with their own intimate relationships.\n\n Sure, they may not have to go through some of the other traumatizing stuff like custody battles and the like, but the way you and your ex-wife went about this was incredibly hurtful contributed to the negative emotions.\n\n>In cases where parents are civil and there is not any overt fighting, it's a pretty tranquil home environment. And often the kids don't really understand how alienated the parents are from one another. So, if the divorce occurs when the child is in college, and he or she did not see it coming, it has the potential to severely destabilize the student's life.\n\nYou LIED to them. You then did **nothing** to help him through it because you did what you're doing STILL and what every parent with adult children do: totally underestimating how it will affect their kids.  \n\n>Helping a college age student adjust to the family dynamics and situation will give them a better opportunity to maintain a healthier relationship with both parents. This is especially important for college-age children who believe away from home\n\nEven now, after a decade of him being angry and upset about it. After a decade of him telling \"it was traumatizing,\" you STILL don't recognize that he was traumatized by this. You prefer to stay in your bubble of \"we didn't traumatize our kids like everyone else.\" When this post, in and of itself, is evidence, that is not true.\n\nYou completely obliterated his sense of self just when he thought he knew who he was,\n\nAnd remember, you had 10 years before the divorce to come to terms with it.  You spent NONE of that time preparing your kids for that eventuality. You just dropped it on them one day and expected them to \"get over it\" because they were adults now.\n\nEDIT: This was an E S H but I think this is relevant.  \n\nOP skips from\n\n>During dinner, we were talking to his in-laws and they asked how long we'd been apart and how good we had a relationship etc. \n\nTo\n\n>Michael at some point, said: \"It wasn't such a good thing for the family, it was a traumatizing experience to see your inspiration as a couple break up and your family fall apart\".\n\nSo what exactly did OP say here that caused his son to respond in such a way? Did he once again lie and completely invalidate his son's trauma? Sire sounds like it to me", "NAH\n\nSee this is a hard one, as for all intents and purposes you lied for half his life until the divorce.

I know it feels like his emotions are an attack on you and your decision, but they\u2019re not, they\u2019re simply arising from the shock of the situation. As someone with experience in the family law field, adults can often suffer more from a divorce than children, as they have had a longer experience with their parents married, making it that much harder to accept the change. It\u2019s not up to you to put a timeline on your son\u2019s grief.

What did you say to him in those moments, over the past 9 years, how did you address his feelings? My suspicion is that you ignored him entirely, told him to \"get over it\" as you have during this encounter, and contributed to his trauma again, and again, and again.\n\nTalk to your son, open up about where this decision came from, and ask him about how he has felt over all these years.

It seems like you and your ex invalidate those feelings in your son, and have tried to insist he shouldn't feel any kind of negative or complicated emotions regarding your divorce. \n\nYes, you and your ex made the choice you thought was best for your family when you stayed together for the kids, but maybe it didn't work out as beautifully as you two would like to tell yourselves. It's a complicated story, and you all did your best, and it's okay, but denying your son's hurt isn't okay. \n\nIt's also not okay for him to snark at you guys about it all the time. I am wondering if it's coming out of nowhere, or in context where others are saying you and your ex's relationship is commendable and Michael is trying to say \"but it hurt too.\"\n\nYou need to have a sit down and a calm time and really listen to what he has to say.

Just because he was an adult and out of the house for the process doesn\u2019t mean it was easy for him to understand. His world changed a lot all at once by moving out and becoming independent, and then the divorce compounded that. \n\nIt sounds like there wasn\u2019t a lot of indication for Michael that you both were unhappy in your marriage. Perhaps not very affectionate or loving but not fighting and angry. Amicable, as you said, and unchanged day to day. It\u2019s understandable he felt a little blindsided by the divorce. \n\nThen he learned the only reason you were together so long was to keep the family intact. And when his move triggered the beginning of the divorce, it\u2019s possible he felt like it was his fault \u2014 that because he left home, he broke up the family enough for you guys to end your marriage. Not to mention he had to grapple with confronting a new reality that the happy marriage he thought his parents had was, in fact, a fa\u00e7ade. \n\nNow maybe you\u2019ve all discussed this, and maybe he\u2019s been to therapy to work through his feelings, and maybe you\u2019ve validated to him everything I\u2019ve said above and tried to assure him it wasn\u2019t his fault. But the way it seems to me based on how you\u2019ve described the situation, you both assumed it would be a blip on the radar for him because he wasn\u2019t in the house. \n\nI will also concede 9 years is a long time for him to still be holding onto this much resentment. It\u2019s concerning he still feels this strongly, and it\u2019s a very clear indication he hasn\u2019t worked through his emotions. Whether that\u2019s because he has some fundamental issues with emotional maturity that need longer term therapy or because he never had his feelings heard, I\u2019ll leave that to you to explore. \n\nFor this situation, I\u2019m saying ESH.

If you care so much about your kids that you stay together for 10 yrs you would think that you'd be, like, worried about the effect the divorce would have even if it happened later? It's totally valid for it to be hard to have your parents get divorced, and yeah, Michael wasn't living w them anymore, but it's gotta be weird to leave home and then immediately hear from your parents that their marriage, which you thought was fine, is over. That certainly doesn't mean that the parents have to stay together or don't have the right to make their own choices, but it's unrealistic for the parents to insist that their kids have no feelings about the situation. \n\n I'm going with ESH bc OP refuses to acknowledge that the divorce might have been hard for his son, which is certainly feeding (but not an excuse for) the son's AH behavior.

To each other.\n\nI consider what they did to be incredibly healthy.\nPeople going the \"lying\" route are pretending that they were miserable and hated each other but put on a good front for their kids. That's not what OP said at all. Micheal seemingly always saw his parents for how they really were, he just didn't realise they weren't romantically in love anymore.", "It was a complete lie. They remained married with the agreement that they would divorce once the children were grown. \n\nThey weren\u2019t faking romance, they were faking remaining married when they both knew they ultimately wanted a divorce when they viewed it as convenient to their timeline. \n\nMichael certainly would benefit from therapy, but he\u2019s not only reacting to the divorce. He is reacting to the charade his parents played for years, and I\u2019m sure it has impacted his ability to trust them.

They aren\u2019t married anymore but they love him and treat each other with respect so it\u2019s not like his entire family disintegrated the day after he moved out.

At a certain point, the son has to realize that his parents\u2019 marriage isn\u2019t about him and the fact that they don\u2019t love each other in romantic way doesn\u2019t mean they were lying about their mutual respect or their love for him.", "And he can eventually appreciate his parents for his healthy process of anger.

The problem is how they handled the divorce and the aftermath of it. They knew they wanted to get a divorce two decades ago. They spent a decade coming to terms with that fact. They could have done the good thing and also prepared their children for it. Instead, they blindsided their son at the most transitional and vulnerable time in his life and then provided him with zero support, beyond an explanation, and expected him to just be perfectly fine.\n\nAnd now they're telling people everything was great and no one had any problems despite Michael spending the last decade telling them the opposite.\n\nOP, in this post, invalidated Michael. I'm gonna paraphrase:\n\n\"Michael says he's traumatized. I tell him how much this hurts to here because my ex-wife wife and I cherish that our kids don't suffer. \"\n\nExcept Michael does suffer. He repeatedly tells OP he suffers, but he continues to say the divorce was \"good for the family.\" When Michael is telling him, \"I'm in the family, and it wasn't good for me", "Yes, he did. It's a known phenomenon. It makes it worse when they aren't expecting it. \n\n>College is a formative time during which young adults are especially needful of parental security and support.

IMO a divorce will hurt either way and will affect your life regardless, it is hard to navigate.

I'm surprised a late teenager/young adult would have such an emotional response to a parents' divorce, even a surprising one, I suppose.\n\nEdit: I would expect anger and (misplaced) guilt about them lying, though.

NTA", "I had a similar experience, what with the early childhood divorce, being paraded back and forth across the country for visits, millions of random other kids and boyfriends and girlfriends from other relationships of my parents', as well as having to wring out even a smidge of child support from my Dad BY MYSELF and I don't even think it was particularly traumatizing. A healthy divorce after years of harmonious parenting seems like heaven compared to even a minute of what happened to people like us and I don't get why Michael is so adamant it was traumatizing. It baffles me.", "My parents divorced after 4 years of fighting after my dad had an affair when I was about 10. My Dad then married his former affair partner who had also divorced. My mother moved away and had alcohol problems. My parents never spoke again. \n\nThere was such a disconnect between those two life stages that they didn\u2019t really inform each other. It was like I had a family life until age 10, then I just had my friends and grandparents, and had to deal with my parents. I still saw my Dad regularly but he was living his own life and marriage now, I was a visitor.\n\nMy brother, sister and I are not as close as we might be, because in truth, there were not that many good shared times. We support each other but step back when support is not needed. We are okay though.\n\nHonestly, I have not been able to fully remember and acknowledge the good times until my own two children reached double digits. Now I can again because I no longer have to link my own story back to my parents story much. I can remember the good times because I no longer care as much about the catastrophe and selfishness of it all. But Dad is dead now from cancer and mum still carries some alcohol damage which is making aging harder.", "same but I did see the fighting. and i gotta say \"this might be worse than a messy divorce\" is far from correct imo. i almost feel offended", "Wasn't it ideal given the circumstances? I'm not sure what the ideal outcome would have been if not for an amicable breakup.", "i agree with this entirely i think it's more of a trust thing. like basically his parents lied / put on a front for a decade. thats gotta mess you up to find out what you thought was real or a certain way was not.  it makes you go back and question everything or reframe it through a new lense.  i dont think it was bad per se of them to stay together if they liked that arrangement but maybe they should have been more honest with the kids (in an age appropriate way).", "And that\u2019s exactly why it was such a shock for him. What he thought was a happy nuclear family was not. \n\nThey thought they were doing the right thing by their kids but were absolutely clearly not. And it\u2019s not fair to blame their son for how he feels about it.", ">I think its a waste of this 29 year old man's life to still be so traumatized.\n\nThat's incredibly cold of you..Jesus christ. \n\nWhat about other people who have traumas, would you tell them they're wasting their time too? \n\nYou're deranged. Seek help.", "OPs son should be happy that his parents are divorced and friends instead of together and unhappy. A lot of people don't get to have both parents at events. A lot of people with divorced parents have to worry about them causing a scene at their wedding.", "Exactly. My parents not being together and having new partners during my adulthood was a chance to make new friends. My parents not being together during my childhood, being lucky to see the non-custodial parent once a year, meeting an evil stepfather (worth it for the awesome brother, but it took therapy and time to get to that realization), all those years were loaded with trauma. Amicable marriage, amicable divorce is like batting .400 lifetime and having some fool complain that you didn't bat 1.000.", "He's an adult, it's time to grow up and get some therapy.", "Where was he a brat about it? He talks about his trauma sometimes?  Op called them \"spiteful comments\" but that seems to be because \"it hurts\" and he *doesn't want to hear how much he hurt his son* so he can \"cherish that my kids don't suffer from the divorce\".  Michael only brought it up here in, in context, in a conversation he didn't start, in what looks to be a response to OP, once again invalidating his pain.", "They could have divorced amicably and remained in their home. There\u2019s no law stating divorced spouses cannot cohabitate.", "Obviously it's easy to criticise in hindsight. But I still can't fathom that lying to your kids about auch a huge thing is a good thing to do. They literally pretended to be a loving couple for 9 years, and separated as soon as their son moved out. \n\nHe genuinely believed that they were a loving couple, but instead his parents lied to him for a decade, and then split as soon as he was gone. It's not hard to anticipate that a teen will feel responsible for their parents divorce.\n\nAlso, parents have an obligation to teach their children about the world. It's sad if feelings fade, but it's a part of life. They didn't teach their children that relationships are build on trust and honesty - they taught them that the happiest couple can be a facade and that people close to him can easily lie to his face for a decade without remorse. It seems obvious that telling a teenage boy that his parents actually lied to him, that their perfect marriage didn't exist and they only pretended to be happy for their kids will cause a breach of trust... \n\nThis hit their son hard, and at the very least they should have urged him to go to therapy when he was still a teen dealing with this revelation, instead of patting themselves on the back for successfully lying to him. 19 isn't adult, your brain isn't finished growing until 25. He has to deal with this now, and should do so sooner than later, but OP should also acknowledge that their approach simply wasn't good, instead of telling him to move on.", "Good thing it\u2019s not a trauma-measuring contest then.  But, if we were keeping score, I\u2019m sure you would win. Which I know is very important to you.", "You're a child. Grow up. 10 years go by and he's stuck.  I indeed had much worse trauma.  The worst is to be stuck.", "I'm sort of surprised you took this stance given your background. I came from a similar background too, and am around the same age. I   \n dealt with all the fights, etc. I also wished my parents would divorce and mine are also still together. Due to all this, I actually empathize with Michael a lot more because I can understand the thought process.\n\nYes his parents are an example to strive for, in terms of maintaining good relations, even after falling out of love. But, at that point, if they are already out of love, I agree with some of the others that they do more harm than good. Because, if they can successfully co-parent, without feeling as if they are still in a relationship, then what should stop them from doing so while actually divorced, even before the kids are grown?\n\nBecause, unfortunately, the result of that is that either the child forms thoughts, or is typically told to or implied to by a parent that, \"if you \\[they\\] didn't exist, I'd be out of here by now...I'd be happy\". And that is a huge, guilt-laden burden on anyone, let alone a child. That's why I am very interested to know how the sister reacted because if they even implied something like this...that they were only still together for the kids...then I bet Michael isn't the only one that thinks that way. He just might be the most agressive at stating his opinion on the matter.", "And there\u2019s no law that spouses that are no longer *in love* can\u2019t remain married. They weren\u2019t living a lie. Marriage is much more than romance. And while the romance died, the partnership, co-parenting and friendship remained. When the kids left home they ended the marriage because there was no longer a need for day-to-day partnership or co-parenting. Why should they have gotten a divorce when they didn\u2019t want to end their marriage? Why is it wrong that they waited until they wanted to?\n\nEdit: also how is telling a 10 year old kid that you\u2019re divorcing but essentially living the same way as when you were married not more confusing than telling a 19 year old that you grew apart over the years and were simply waiting for the kids to grow up to divorce?\n\n He would then be crying that they traumatized him by living together while divorced and making him believe they would cohabitate together as monks for the rest of their life and he was so shocked when they moved on after he went to college.", "Having a secret \u2018countdown to divorce/kids move out\u2019 is not being honest.", "You continuously invalidate the feelings of others who feel trauma. He should move on. But not by cretins like you invalidating his experience or trauma. \n\n\nHe needs to move on through therapy. Not being told to simply let it go it's been 9 years. The fucking audacity.", "OP didn't mention finances as part of the equation at all, so while that's certainly possible it's just as likely it would have been fine.", "If they had divorced when their son was 10, they could have processed the divorce together. \n\nInstead, they got a ten year head start to come to terms with it, and then were surprised that their son had an emotional reaction to it.", "But now he\u2019s had 9 years to process it and he\u2019s STILL whining about it. Has he done any work to process his \u201ctrauma\u201d? No. He\u2019s just wants to continue punishing his parents for a choice that has no bearing on his day-to-day life and remain the forever victim of an idyllic childhood. He needs therapy and to touch grass."]}
