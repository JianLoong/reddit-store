You are under no obligation to share what you wrote for your grandfather and they should respect that. This is nothing more than nosy people wanting to be nosy. If in the future you feel comfortable enough to share that\u2019s your choice. I find it extremely rude they would try to guilt trip you over this.

You are not obligated to share your speech to anyone.", "I'm going with NAH because your family is in the throes of grief, which can do weird things to people. I think it's weird they're demanding to see what you wrote, but sometimes raw grief makes people latch on to small things and turn them into big things. I've also seen grief amplify anger, even about tiny, inconsequential stuff.\n\nYou are absolutely not the A for deciding your thoughts are personal, and changing your mind about sharing them. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss, and I wish you and your family peace.", "NTA. Everyone grieves differently and in many ways. I think its kinda rude that someone else is trying to force you to follow what they want in this trying time. Manage yourself how you see fit and in your own time.", "NTA...I'm sorry for your loss. You're entitled to whatever privacy you need.", "NTA- Whatever thoughts you had were meant for your grandfather, not for the entire room's entertainment if you chose not to share.", "NTA \n\nSounds like you want confirmation that you did not commit an injustice to your family. You did not. Your relative made that up as some sort of melodramatic narrative.  I've never heard that particular guilt trip before, so it's quite unique but still pretty lame. A eulogy, good or bad, is not a sacred rite owed to the bereaved.\n\nHere is a real injustice, for context. Let's say you were supposed to give the only eulogy at the funeral, there was no one else who could do it besides you, and you went up there and said, \"Deez nuts! YOLO!\" And then you did a crotch chop and dropped the mic and walked out.  In this case, your family would be right to think maybe you were a selfish jerk, but even then, in this extreme example, a more understanding family would probably chalk it up to grief and never speak about it again except to laugh about it years later.\n\nYou were there with your family to say goodbye. That's what you owed and you gave it willingly. Sorry for your loss.", "Fuck, NTA.  Everyone grieves in their own way.", "NTA. Your family is just nosey, and want to know what was in your speech that made you decide not to speak after all. Was it something rude and insensitive which you decided not to say after seeing your fathers grief? Was it something embarrassing about grandpa they would love to know? But you are not obliged to cater to their curiosity. The speech was never given, so it never actually existed.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Talk to him about it, maybe you can rewrite or rephrase what you wanted to say wile taking these new insights into account.  \nIt may still help you get some closure. But there's no obligation to share with anyone else.", "NTA. This is your choice.\n\nI wrote and delivered a speech at my mother's funeral. It was not bad, and people were very warmly outspoken about it. My sister took the paper with the notes, and kept taking it around to relatives and friends who had not been there, reading it to them. I had very mixed feelings about this. Those were my words and my emotions, to be delivered once, they were not hers to carry around in order to make our elderly friends cry. At the same time I knew doing this released her grief and that of others. I had managed to put it into words, making it visible and manageable, putting it in context and giving it shape and meaning. It helped my sister, and she wanted to share that help.\n\nI shared, and at the end, it was right. But I was of mixed emotions about it, and could as easily have tipped the other way.", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA cos your speech is about the personal memories you\u2019ve had with your grandfather so it\u2019s not wrong if you don\u2019t feel comfortable letting other people see the speech. The fact that people keep pestering you and trying to guilt you into showing the letter is wrong cos it\u2019s private info of yours. Your situation is kinda similar to how people find someone\u2019s diary or journal and are try to get the person who wrote it to give it to them so they can read it. \nBasically don\u2019t allow them to read your speech if you don\u2019t feel comfortable doing so cos it\u2019s about personal information that you\u2019d rather keep to yourself.", "This. NTA", "Yeah I felt like that was most likely why she seemed kind of ticked off that I didnt want to share. The only true reason I didnt want to is because I feel like alot of people were expecting this to be another way to see more of who my grandfather was, or to try and feel the same emotions that my father made everyone feel at the funeral, but honestly what I wrote is kind of disappointing and no where on the same level as what my father prepared. I felt like my dad summed up everything about his life beautifully and that it deserved to be the last thing said on his behalf.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. If you ever wish to share what you wrote please don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as what your dad wrote, you have your own experience with your grandfather and your words and thoughts of him have meaning. There doesn\u2019t have to be a last word.\n\n\nBut again, you are also not obligated at all to share with anyone. It\u2019s your words to share or keep or burn."]}
