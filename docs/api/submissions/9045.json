You burned the bridge but that\u2019s different than being TA.", "This sort of thing is better suited for Ask A Manager, since you're really asking about workplace norms and behaviors, not assholishness.\n\nAnyway, to break things down here:\n\n* The other intern being converted earlier because he graduated earlier is normal. Companies don't like to convert employees to full time before they graduate, for obvious reasons.\n* The other intern delegating tasks is something you should have explicitly brought up with your supervisor or management, especially prior to him being hired. I understand not wanting to rock the boat, but you need to make it clear with your supervisor/manager when you're being asked to do other people's work and whether they support that direction. Either they don't, and you can resolve the issue, or they do and at least you know where you stand.\n* Asking about an LOI with a full salary breakdown ten times in the span of a month and a half, before you've graduated, is excessive. That's multiple times a week on a task they've told you is not a priority for them, with no clear urgency as described.\n* Them being busy but still having time to do full time employee hiring is reasonable. You're a kid who isn't graduating for a while and who they might not have even been planning to actually hire full time, assuming not just that you'd get the job but that you're more of a priority than other tasks or onboarding people who aren't already part of the company is foolish.\n* The nature of CTC vs. salary vs. a breakdown is pretty specific to tech jobs, so I can't say how useful/useless that is.\n* Them threatening your job over a single Saturday you had pre-approved for leave is extremely weird (and it's also weird you applied for leave on a weekend you're off, TBF), and working through a newly full-time employee who isn't your supervisor is also extremely weird. Either there's something more to this story, or they were being deeply shitty here, or some combination of both. This alone is a good reason to be extremely unhappy with a job and worth bringing up with either your actual supervisor or in an exit interview.\n* Other interns being paid more than you because they are US based or otherwise in a higher COL area is normal. There are tons of arguments whether this should happen from a moral/ethical/hiring perspective, but as a practical matter if you live in a lower CoL area for a remote tech job there is a strong chance you will be compensated less than your peers in the same job as the industry stands today.\n* Your resignation is fine provided you gave appropriate notice, but yeah, it is a bit weird to directly resign to HR without actually informing your boss unless you just don't feel comfortable talking to your boss at all.\n* It's totally reasonable to leave for a better paid opportunity, basically regardless of all of the points above.\n\nOverall, you didn't really do anything *wrong* here, and the company does sound bad at communicating with you, but at the same time you're missing a lot of workplace norms and getting frustrated at things that are typical to the working world, so you need to recalibrate your expectations.", "Nta.

You don't owe your employer anything more than your notice- also if you did talk to a manager and they offered to match the other salary- you'd likely be next on the chopping block.

Nope. They deserve nothing from you.", "Honestly? NTA for leaving but YTA for like, your whole personality while there?? \n\nThere\u2019s a few things to break down here:\n\n1. The perceived stupid intern being offered a job before you because they graduated is extremely normal. They have a degree and you don\u2019t. You\u2019re not the boss reviewing their work to see if it meets minimum standards. If they have a degree and got hired, it was obviously enough for entry level. Maybe that means the company has low standards\u2026 but it isn\u2019t some slight on you. It\u2019s standard practice. \n\n2. You claim the intern was delegating to you and other team members. If he was the same level intern as you, why did you accept the delegation of tasks? If a coworker at my same level made me do their work for them I would just\u2026 not. Then when the work isn\u2019t done, it\u2019s on them. This obviously should have been addressed with your supervisor. You claim the supervisor was new and you did talk to them. Did he okay the other intern delegating tasks and tell you to do them? If so, that\u2019s a directive and yeah, you might find it annoying, but that\u2019s what your boss wants so do it. \n\n3. You asked for an LOI 10 times in 1.5 months!?!?! By the third I would have flat out said your working style was not compatible with the company. Companies hire based on *fit* not just skill. If someone is an annoying asshole in an interview, the manager who would have to work with them everyday isn\u2019t going to offer them the job. You\u2019re an *intern* not a priority. \n\n4. The days off thing sounds like a misunderstanding - did they actually accept you days off? If so, that\u2019s a bad workplace culture - not arguments there. \n\n5. Interns hired after you made more because the market is competitive and with inflation increasing you need higher wages to attract the same number of applicants as you did previously. It\u2019s just economics, not a personal slight. \n\n6. No issue with directly resigning for a better job, but I would have at least copied the manager as well as HR. It\u2019s also just a poor move, as you won\u2019t be able to use them as a reference now. You also could have taken the job offer salary and used it as leverage, and either they match it or you give your two weeks. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s typically done so they\u2019re not blindsided. But honestly who cares about fucking over a corporation? No arguments about leaving to get your money, just know you can\u2019t use them as a reference. \n\nAs someone who does a lot of hiring, I\u2019m sorry to say that the way you conduct yourself (criticizing other team members, second guessing your boss, pestering administration) would be a huge no for me. Work sucks and you have to do what your boss tells you. Incompetent people get promoted all the time. Skilled people get passed over. It sucks, but being condescending about it just makes you look bad. \n\nI\u2019m guessing they waffled on you because they might have worked with you for long enough to\u2026 not want to work with you permanently. That\u2019s the benefit/danger of interning - you get a much better impression of what a coworker will be like long term compared to an interview. For good or for bad.", "NTA.

Especially in tech jobs, your managers may or may not know the details of what you\u2019re working on, so you have to advocate for yourself and ensure that their knowledge of your projects come from you. Have 1-1s with them, learn what they care about, build a relationship.

That's why I sent a resignation mail.\n\nSorry to say, but this makes you look far worse.\n\nFirst off, your notice is your notice. You don't need to wait for the manager to deliver the news to have talked to him first. You say \"hey, I'm putting in my two weeks notice effective immediately, my final day is planned to be X\", and then as soon as that conversation is over you email it out. You made a mistake here by thinking that \"talk to him first\" meant delaying your plans; it literally just means to talk to him first so he learns about it from you and can immediately address any concerns or plans for your two weeks, rather than having to deal with the entire founding team asking him why an intern is blasting them with a resignation before he even learned about it.\n\nSecond, emailing the entire founding team to resign in a rage as an intern is nuts! Sending your resignation email far above the level that you actually report to is a very weird, bridge-burning tactic, and would absolutely justify a manager being annoyed because it's way outside of professional norms and the implication of resigning that way is that you're using your resignation as a way of criticizing your manager or the company as a whole.

OP was not wrong to leave the job for something better, but in the future, including at the better job, they will need to realize things like \"sometimes what's important to me isn't important to the company\" or \"a coworker with different qualifications getting hired/promoted isn't an assessment of our relative skill\".", "The point is that shady companies will sometimes offer to match the other offer and then when the candidate takes it- will start furiously looking to replace you- and then lay you off with little to no notice.", "I'd say that's your manager's point.  I doubt anything different would have happened had you went to him first.  Maybe he tries to beat the other offer, but more likely he just wishes you luck.  However you effectively told HR you don't trust your manager making him look bad, and I don't really see what he did wrong.  \n\nRealistically things take time,  As an example I filled out a self assessment in November, had a meeting to discuss last years performance in January, and will expect a new salary offer sometime next month.  That happens every year and my company isn't that big.  So 10 asks in 6 weeks is probably not likely to get different answers.", "You do not need to talk to your manager before giving your manager notice. Ever.

The only real issue is that you communicated it to a wider audience, beyond manager & HR, which is usually something managers want to be in control of b/c they should be in charge of the transition plan and not have people going off half cocked.\n\nPart of the deal w/ having an intern is that they pay you less, but they watch over you more - it isn't just about work product, it is alao about regular 1:1's to help you navigate the corporate culture and norms, etc. They were not holding up their end of the bargain.", "I've told them that I'm firm on my decision to quit, Thanks for the reply!", "Ah, actually I had a conversation with the my manager today he said you should've told me that you were going to resign so that he'd have talked something from economic point of view, whatever that is. \n\nAnd by founding team I meant CTO, I think I didnt mentioned this but the company size is pretty small and the HR himself is an intern so thought I might include him as well so that he's in loop", "No part of your comment even touches upon how OP was underpayed much less than the new interns, told to come in on an important exam day or any of the other mistreatment by the middle management. \n\nIf you treat someone like this, you will get the same treatment back in the future. \n\nThe supervisors in this post are TA for their behavior. \n\nThank god nowadays students can share their experiences with bad companies to fellow students and even have university\u2019s record reviews.", "That's fucked up!", "The company size is very small and since the HR himself is an intern so I thought keeping the CTO (what i meant by founding team) under the loop would be good idea", "Your manager might have been talking about trying to give you some sort of counteroffer, or might have been talking about talking about the costs of hiring somebody new on to replace you; that's unclear. That part isn't really your problem, but doesn't change that it would be the correct, polite thing to do to inform your manager and then immediately send a written resignation to him and HR.\n\nIf the CTO is only one step above your manager or you often talk to him as part of your job duties, that's reasonable, but \"founding team\" implied multiple higher level executives so I was under the impression you basically sent it to the whole senior management team/C-suite.", "> No part of your comment even touches upon how OP was underpayed much less than the new interns, told to come in on an important exam day or any of the other mistreatment by the middle management.\n\nI addressed all of those, though?\n\nI said that being expected to come in on a day off was very shitty and strange, and should be brought up with their actual supervisor.\n\nI also noted that salary differences due to CoL are very normal. You might believe it's wrong, but in tech nowadays it is still common for remote jobs to have large CoL salary adjustments, especially if the implication is that OP is not from the US and other interns are.\n\nIn this situation, OP is correct to leave their job on the whole and does identify some very shitty treatment, but also seems upset at some totally normal stuff they should at least realize will be present anywhere in their career.", "It really isn't that big of a deal that you did that at all. Just wanted to point out the norm, but there are always good reasons to vary from that.", "You didn\u2019t address it, you minimized it and made excuses for their mistreatment. \n\nI am not trying to fight or insult you in particular. However, you don\u2019t seem to understand how that mistreatment by the employers will have consequences.", "I understand why OP left and supported them doing so, but I don't think it's \"minimizing\" anything to point out the reality that remote tech jobs do have CoL adjustments, and I explicitly said the firing threat was a reason to be unhappy and leave the job.\n\nIt genuinely seems like you just don't like the fact my post has more nuance than \"yeah fuck them bro\", which is a fair response overall to their worst behavior but doesn't teach OP anything.", "You are  trying to just mistreatment as nuance. \n\nI am not surprised though, you were too scared to even post a Judgement."]}
