This is on purpose, as my mother explained, I need to understand how much grief I'm setting up my family for, and I should be more aware that I still could lose the baby.\n\nI'm sorry you have such a shitty family..my God... I'm not for cutting ties but in this king of reactions I fail to see any other course of actions. I'm so so sorry, shelter yourself, you have another family now, your own, and your \"parents\" (they don t behave as such) can take a hike. \n\nSo so sorry. \n\n>This is on purpose, as my mother explained, I need to understand how much grief I'm setting up my family for, and I should be more aware that I still could lose the baby.\n\nFuck them, maybe there is past traumas that explain it, but their approach is si insensitive for you in one of the most challenging period of your life. \n\n> feel bad for already getting attached to my baby, and I think they might be right that I should've waited.\n\nNO,  its perfectly normal and healthy, the contrary isn't. Your baby need to feel wanted and your love even before it is born. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I am 6 weeks along too and we told my parents and in laws last weekend. even though it\u2019s very early, we wanted them to know - especially because if something goes wrong I would want their support. Everyone was absolutely delighted and completely understood that it was early. I\u2019m really sorry that this happened to you.", "RIGHT\u203d They don't want to be told because then if op loses the baby, they might also be sad and will have to wait a little longer to get a grand kid? SERIOUSLY? Not like their daughter/ niece/ granddaughter will have just LOST HER CHILD OR WHATEVER. That's clearly NOT so DEEPLY SCARRING as them maybe having to wait a little to have a grand kid.\n\nThey just don't want to be bothered to have to support her if the baby does die, or probably also if she needs anything throughout the pregnancy. They're preemptively saying \"don't come crying to us\" in case the thing that is totally out of op's control but still happens to something like 15% of mothers happens. There's an 85% chance this won't happen at all, but they were like, 'let's just torpedo this relationship anyways.'\n\nNTA", "Something weird is going on here (like someone lost a lot of pregnancies or a group of sisters all lost multiple pregnancies or something). If one person were to react this way, I would write it off on that person being an AH, but the fact that 3+ people responded this way without conferring with one another makes it seem like something much bigger happened to cause this weirdness.\n\nEDIT: grammar", "Or they had a big loss, or series of losses in the past.\n\nIt is customary to wait some weeks or months before telling.\n\nThey went too far though.", "12-16 weeks just to be certain... or maybe even after the first birthday! NTA", "I want to yell at all the family members. I'm so angry at them. \n\nOp NTA", "I wonder whether there has been repeated lost pregnancies in this family. I can only imagine that a whole lot of trauma led to OP's family responses, because otherwise, this is just absolutely strange behavior.", "Exactly. It is to save you from having to open yourself up and tell multiple people about a loss. Not to save your parents pain at \"their\" loss", "So true.  OPs family sound like huge AH.  It's her first time pregnant and she excitedly called to tell her mom, to get gray rocked?  That's super messed up.  I think I agree with her husband, NC is probably in order.  I would be petty AF here, wouldn't let them visit the baby for at least 3 months, assuming full term and delivery.  OP, you're NTA for being excited and wanting to share that with people that you assumed loved you and would support you.  Sorry you're finding out how things really stand, but at least now you know.", "Well, the whole idea of someone's family saying, \"don't put your heartbreak on us.\" What the hell?\n\nIf one of my loved ones was suffering heartbreak, especially at the level of losing a child, I welcome them putting it on me. That's what you do when you love someone and want to support them.\n\nI was honestly a bit shocked at the story. They seem so villainous.", "I agree. My first thought was that the family might be devoutly Jewish, because I'm aware that they have some rules about not announcing or celebrating a pregnancy, for fear of losing the baby; or even naming the baby for a few weeks after they're born, just in case(in which case, I would gladly retract my comment.) But, given that I had just said something nasty about them, I didn't want to come back and ask about their religion.", "This! Say nothing more about it to your family then post the photos of the first birthday party on social media.\n\nNTA", "AGREED! That's what a SUPPORT SYSTEM is. They're so callous!", "We aren't Jewish. I know my grandmother had at least one miscarriage after she had my mom and aunt, but aside from that I don't know of any."]}
