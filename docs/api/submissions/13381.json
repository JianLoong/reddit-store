From your post, it seems like you took an unnecessarily rude approach from the start. The woman was there first and, as the staff said, she had every right to do her hip thrusts on the flat bench. Whether she had 1 set left or 10, she\u2019s a member of the gym and can use the equipment how she likes. As you mentioned, 90% of time there\u2019s a wait, so you have to be patient like everyone else if the bench is being used as opposed to judging and being rude after a minuscule conversation and no wait.\n\nIf she, the staff, and 2 others think you were an AH, you\u2019re probably just an AH.", "You can wait If it is only one more set. But look somewhere else. Otherwise it feels like stalking or Voyeurismus. \n\nAsk the Studio to get more flat benches, if this happens often.", "YTA. You started out seemingly polite-nothing wrong with asking how many sets they have left. Most people won\u2019t lurk directly by but if it\u2019s only one set left it\u2019s not unreasonable, you can stand nearby as long as you\u2019re not staring at them directly/hovering/directly in their line of sight. \n\nWhy YTA: from the start you\u2019ve made it clear that you don\u2019t feel like this lady belongs. You insinuate that you did her a favor when you \u201clet the lady do her exercise\u201d This entire entry drips of condescension and I\u2019m sure it came across in your communication with her. I\u2019m doubtful that you yourself used good etiquette when you approached her, you certainly didn\u2019t in the conversation. \n\n1) It\u2019s a shared gym and she deserves her space as well. Doesn\u2019t matter if a dude is doing weird shit on a machine that makes no sense: if they\u2019re actively using it, you remain respectful and ask them how many sets they have left. (There are of course exceptions like the classic bicep curls in the squat rack because that is an exercise that can be done elsewhere without the rack or if they\u2019re taking up equipment for an inordinate amount of time\u2026those are two instances where a respectful request to relocate/wrap up is not unreasonable). \n\n2) In the absence of a dedicated hip thrust bench, it is VERY common to use a flat bench. (Now if it\u2019s a bolted bench and there were other unbolted benches/a designated hip thrust platform available it\u2019s a little different and we approach curling in the squat rack territory\u2026but your attitude still sucks)\n\n3) You disregarded basic etiquette and gave her shit when she requested some space. Respect the request, she was aware you called downs. No one likes to feel crowded and you made it clear you felt entitled to that space. \n\nGym bro rule #1: don\u2019t be a dick.", "YTA \n\n1.

Especially if they then stand nearby and wait. You people know exactly what you\u2019re doing standing there staring trying to pressure them to leave. It\u2019s super rude. You may not approve of her use of the bench but it\u2019s a shared gym and she has just as much right to use the equipment. It\u2019s rude and you look like an entitled jerk trying to pressure her off equipment because, how dare she make you have wait for something You want. She was right to call you out.", "YTA. She was well within her rights to do hip thrusts at the bench. Her suggestion that you do another exercise sounds reasonable to me; personally I'd find it really uncomfortable if I was doing hip thrusts and someone insisted on hovering around me.", "This is dumb.

The criticism seems to be:\n\n\"You should have done exactly the same thing, but somehow have it turn out nicely.\"", "NTA - You asked how many sets she had left, and stayed by the machine because you were next in line. There is nothing wrong with that and it sounds like she got annoyed at you first about this.\n\nPeople seem to overlook the fact that there are usually lines, so you would lose your place by moving to another machine. Just really simple.\n\nDon't worry about it OP, there has been a lot of stuff lately where people think it is ok to film themselves at gym's and take offense at anyone talking to them, just so they can post it online later for internet points.

You are not in a position to \u201clet the lady do her exercises.\u201d This phrase is honestly the entirety of your problem because it\u2019s indicative of a horrible attitude towards women in the gym. She does not need your permission (\u201clet her\u201d). You\u2019re wrong about the use of equipment (flat bench is perfect for this move, due to the height, edge padding and stability). It\u2019s no coincidence that she sensed your judgement and impatience and was right, you obviously were giving it off with your body language so take some ownership. And using the term \u201clady\u201d like this reeks of condescension.

You can be 100% allowed to do something, and still be a dick for doing it.  \n\n\nFinally, given how many awkward gym encounters I've seen in person, I'm guessing that ESH regarding the case in the OP.  Given his clearly strong feelings on the subject, I'm guessing he probably sounded a little snotty when he asked about the sets left, and then he was probably mean mugging her while she finished up.  I went ESH here because from the sounds of it, she really could've just as easily used another less popular piece of equipment, but also because its ridiculous to think you can just go wait elsewhere and have a snowball's chance in hell of getting that bench next given how many people are scoping the bench on a Monday.  It's very normal for people to hangout if you say you have 1 set left.  If you don't get dibs in, you're not getting the bench.", "Can confirm this, older men at the gym are always ready to throw hands if necessary (and they are MORE then happy to do it).", "Standing and watching is different than standing and waiting. No where in his post did he say he watched. He actually explicitly said he waited. You\u2019re jumping to conclusions because he\u2019s a man and she\u2019s a women, and that since she got uncomfortable, that she must have been being watched. He could have been staring at his phone facing another direction. \n\nIt\u2019s much more likely that she felt rushed, which in her case, that sucks for her. But he\u2019s not in charge of how she feels in a public space, nor is he responsible for going out of his way to make sure she\u2019s comfortable.", "Both I guess. How would I know when they are actually done if I don't look at them? \n\nIts not like I'm on top of them, staring, or in their personal space, but its also clear to other people when someone is waiting for equipment. The way this place is set up there is actually a 6 lane indoor track between the equipment and where people are waiting. But usually I'm not going to go do something else while I'm waiting. I'll just warm up or strech more.", "Waiting near a machine is in no way rude. He asked how many sets, and waited for her to finish since she only had a bit left. Zero of that is rude, nothing he did was wrong.\n\nThen she tells him to go away, that is the rude part. I fail to understand how people ignore this. He only had been rude since she was rude first", "I do think it's rude to use a flat bench attached to a rack specifically for bench press for hip thrusts. If I saw someone doing that, I'd check to see if there is an open flat bench and ask/offer to help them move. They can obviously say no, but it's not good gym etiquette to use specialized equipment for something unrelated. I've seen people doing sit ups in the middle of a squat rack they weren't using because they were new to the environment. It happens and a polite conversation is never rude.", "You do it with your shoulder blades against the end of the bench. It\u2019s not unsafe, you don\u2019t need your elbows to move the barbell up. You should be able to do it with your glutes with your hands holding the barbell.", "This is the most comprehensive (and correct) comment here, from someone with an appropriate username.", "I don't know if you understand any french at all, but if you google \"Chest bras\", there is a classic skit about gym bros that is just friggin hilarious. They say about 12 words in the whole thing mind you haha", "He literally reports that people who were present and saw him did say he was rude. Big clue.", "Thank you stranger.  I've spent an inordinate amount of time in gyms lol.  Keeping them happy places require that we all play our part and not always just doing something for the sole purpose that we're allowed to.  But that goes all ways and means that even when someone is using something we'd like to use, we don't have to be dicks to them.", "Can do a set in under a minute.", "Because people can't be biased? Someone who only noticed after she got loud and he replied rudely back might assume the big muscley gym guy *must have* been out of line because look at him. Two people saying he was rude does not convey as much info as you think it does. \n\nHe followed normal gym etiquette, and he confirmed in a comment he was standing off to the side and not staring. As-written, he did nothing wrong, and I don't see how people can find him at fault without making assumptions beyond the scope of the post.", "That's fair."]}
