From your post, it seems like you took an unnecessarily rude approach from the start. The woman was there first and, as the staff said, she had every right to do her hip thrusts on the flat bench. Whether she had 1 set left or 10, she\u2019s a member of the gym and can use the equipment how she likes. As you mentioned, 90% of time there\u2019s a wait, so you have to be patient like everyone else if the bench is being used as opposed to judging and being rude after a minuscule conversation and no wait.\n\nIf she, the staff, and 2 others think you were an AH, you\u2019re probably just an AH.", "You can wait If it is only one more set. But look somewhere else. Otherwise it feels like stalking or Voyeurismus. \n\nAsk the Studio to get more flat benches, if this happens often.", "YTA. You started out seemingly polite-nothing wrong with asking how many sets they have left. Most people won\u2019t lurk directly by but if it\u2019s only one set left it\u2019s not unreasonable, you can stand nearby as long as you\u2019re not staring at them directly/hovering/directly in their line of sight. \n\nWhy YTA: from the start you\u2019ve made it clear that you don\u2019t feel like this lady belongs. You insinuate that you did her a favor when you \u201clet the lady do her exercise\u201d This entire entry drips of condescension and I\u2019m sure it came across in your communication with her. I\u2019m doubtful that you yourself used good etiquette when you approached her, you certainly didn\u2019t in the conversation. \n\n1) It\u2019s a shared gym and she deserves her space as well. Doesn\u2019t matter if a dude is doing weird shit on a machine that makes no sense: if they\u2019re actively using it, you remain respectful and ask them how many sets they have left. (There are of course exceptions like the classic bicep curls in the squat rack because that is an exercise that can be done elsewhere without the rack or if they\u2019re taking up equipment for an inordinate amount of time\u2026those are two instances where a respectful request to relocate/wrap up is not unreasonable). \n\n2) In the absence of a dedicated hip thrust bench, it is VERY common to use a flat bench. (Now if it\u2019s a bolted bench and there were other unbolted benches/a designated hip thrust platform available it\u2019s a little different and we approach curling in the squat rack territory\u2026but your attitude still sucks)\n\n3) You disregarded basic etiquette and gave her shit when she requested some space. Respect the request, she was aware you called downs. No one likes to feel crowded and you made it clear you felt entitled to that space. \n\nGym bro rule #1: don\u2019t be a dick.", "YTA \n\n1.

Especially if they then stand nearby and wait. You people know exactly what you\u2019re doing standing there staring trying to pressure them to leave. It\u2019s super rude. You may not approve of her use of the bench but it\u2019s a shared gym and she has just as much right to use the equipment. It\u2019s rude and you look like an entitled jerk trying to pressure her off equipment because, how dare she make you have wait for something You want. She was right to call you out.", "YTA. She was well within her rights to do hip thrusts at the bench. Her suggestion that you do another exercise sounds reasonable to me; personally I'd find it really uncomfortable if I was doing hip thrusts and someone insisted on hovering around me.", "This is dumb.

The criticism seems to be:\n\n\"You should have done exactly the same thing, but somehow have it turn out nicely.\"", "NTA - You asked how many sets she had left, and stayed by the machine because you were next in line. There is nothing wrong with that and it sounds like she got annoyed at you first about this.\n\nPeople seem to overlook the fact that there are usually lines, so you would lose your place by moving to another machine. Just really simple.\n\nDon't worry about it OP, there has been a lot of stuff lately where people think it is ok to film themselves at gym's and take offense at anyone talking to them, just so they can post it online later for internet points.

You are not in a position to \u201clet the lady do her exercises.\u201d This phrase is honestly the entirety of your problem because it\u2019s indicative of a horrible attitude towards women in the gym. She does not need your permission (\u201clet her\u201d). You\u2019re wrong about the use of equipment (flat bench is perfect for this move, due to the height, edge padding and stability). It\u2019s no coincidence that she sensed your judgement and impatience and was right, you obviously were giving it off with your body language so take some ownership. And using the term \u201clady\u201d like this reeks of condescension. It might feel like you weren\u2019t doing anything but your attitude is clear and women aren\u2019t stupid, we pick up in this and most of us are at 0 tolerance for this in the gym. It\u2019s not an excuse to snap, but it doesn\u2019t sound like she started the bad vibes here. Next time, assume she might know more than you do about her individual body and workout needs and the best equipment to use, ask her to let you know when she\u2019s done her set so you can take over, and then move out of any chance of being seen as lurking, out of respect for women who are stared at all day, everyday.", "YTA.

It's important to remember that everyone has their own preferred exercises and ways of working out, and it's not up to you to dictate what they should or shouldn't do or where they should do it. It can be frustrating to have to wait for a machine/bench, but ultimately it's up to you to manage your own time and workouts and not try to influence or intimidate others into adjusting what they're doing.\n\nIn the future, simply wait your turn and avoid making comments about other people's exercise choices.
