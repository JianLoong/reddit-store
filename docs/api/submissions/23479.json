It sounds like you have some good reasons for this decision. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should feel bad about about your choice. Your mother is behaving poorly in this situation. The first issue is that she kicked you out of the house, which is never justified. In some places it\u2019s actually illegal to kick out your underaged child. There are some extreme circumstances were a person might need to remove their child from the home but just kicking them out is not the way to do it. The other issue is how she is behaving now. It\u2019s understandable that she might be a bit upset that you are not coming back to live with her, but she needs to learn to cope with those feelings. You discussed your decision and reasoning with her but she continues to push the issue. She is going even one step further by getting your grandparent involved which, as another commenter mentioned, seems like manipulative behaviour. She should respect your choice and stop bringing it up. If she continues to behave in this way it might be a good idea to reach out to your dad and work together with him to find a solution to this problem.", "You have laid out a number of very good, logical, reasons for continuing to live with your Dad.

She might be lonely without you.", "NAH, sounds like it\u2019s tricky for everyone. Sorry. \n\nPeople talking about your Mother wanting child support money are paranoid - normally child support doesn\u2019t come close to covering the cost of a dependant.
