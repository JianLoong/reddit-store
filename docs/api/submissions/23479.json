If there's a custody agreement, your dad should try to get it amended to give him full custody.", "NTA.  You have stated many mental and physical health positive reasons for living with your dad.  You don\u2019t specify what you mom and dad argued about daily, so it\u2019s hard to determine what that situation was. \n\nYour mother should see those positives and be happy that you are happy.", "NTA your mom played a stupid game by kicking you out now she has to live with the stupid prize. Good luck at your dads! Sounds like that\u2019s what\u2019s really really the best for everyone.", "NTA. It's your decision and she is even the one that kicked you out, so she really brought this on herself. Good to hear you are more comfortable at your dad's place!", "NTA\n\nLiving at your Dad's seems to be much more suitable for you. Luckily you are old enough to choose for yourself.\nPerhaps you should ask your dad to talk to your mom to get her off your back?\n\nGood luck!", "NTA your mum played a stupid game and won a stupid price. Having said that, it seems that she did you a favour. You are happier and healthier. Stick with your dad. Good luck!", "NTA. You\u2019re 15 years old so you know what\u2019s right for you", "NTA you should choose were to live and have well thought out reasons . \nOn top of that she kicked you out , I say it again kicked you out ! \nI\u2019m not one to throw this word lightly but she definitely is manipulative trying to get your grandparents involved and from appearances constantly pressuring you . \nDo not feel like an AH you have valid reasons plus she kicked you out", "You're old enough to make that choice and have valid reason to do so. NTA", "NTA because your mom kicked you out and it seems like you have a more stable life at your dad's house. Plus things seem way better there", "NTA. I know you pointed out the many reasons why their house is better for you, practically, but you're allowed to say that you like something more than something else. You can tell your mom that you don't like the way your treated at her house even if it makes her upset. \n\nShe kicked you out: no self respecting mother kicks out a 15 year old and then has the gall to act like wanting you back is because of her good heart. It's not. She doesn't know what youre telling your dad and her reputation probably hangs on you telling the truth or lying for her. \n\nDon't lie for her. Tell your dad you feel much more secure and safe in his home, make it known that what your mom did had an impact on you.", "NTA. She made her choice, now she has to live with the consequences.", "NTA. You are 15 and so you are old enough to have input as to who you want to live with. It sounds like you have some good reasons for this decision. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should feel bad about about your choice. Your mother is behaving poorly in this situation. The first issue is that she kicked you out of the house, which is never justified. In some places it\u2019s actually illegal to kick out your underaged child. There are some extreme circumstances were a person might need to remove their child from the home but just kicking them out is not the way to do it. The other issue is how she is behaving now. It\u2019s understandable that she might be a bit upset that you are not coming back to live with her, but she needs to learn to cope with those feelings. You discussed your decision and reasoning with her but she continues to push the issue. She is going even one step further by getting your grandparent involved which, as another commenter mentioned, seems like manipulative behaviour. She should respect your choice and stop bringing it up. If she continues to behave in this way it might be a good idea to reach out to your dad and work together with him to find a solution to this problem.", "You have laid out a number of very good, logical, reasons for continuing to live with your Dad.  I think your Mom may be regretting kicking you out.  But you seem to be flourishing where you are.  Stay at your Dad\u2019s.  \nNTA", "NTA. Overriding everything else, *she kicked you out*!\n\nDon't ever give her the chance to do it again.\n\nShe made her choice about where you live when she kicked you out: anywhere but with her.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom kicked you out. You are happier with your dad. Stay with him.", "There\u2019s a stigma around moms not having custody of their kids, no matter what the reason. She may be feeling some embarrassment over it. Ask her if anyone has been making remarks about it and set those folks straight if need be.", "NTA - it sounds like she misses having you around. \nIs she all alone in her house now? She might be lonely without you.", "NAH, sounds like it\u2019s tricky for everyone. Sorry. \n\nPeople talking about your Mother wanting child support money are paranoid - normally child support doesn\u2019t come close to covering the cost of a dependant. Also if she\u2019s driving you around daily she obviously isn\u2019t a deadbeat and does care. \n\nShe probably regrets asking you to leave and badly misses you - but at the same time you\u2019ve realised you\u2019re better off living with your Father and you need to prioritise your own needs. \n\nIf you want to try to find some middle ground, maybe you could stay at her place on eg a Wednesday night, or you could make time to go on walks together, etc etc - basically find a low stress, low commitment way of nurturing the relationship to be one you\u2019re happy with. \n\nIt sounds like you should also stop giving her reasons for your decision, as it will just continue the circular conversation, and it sounds like you\u2019ve made up your mind so there\u2019s no conversation to be had.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
