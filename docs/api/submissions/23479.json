I know you pointed out the many reasons why their house is better for you, practically, but you're allowed to say that you like something more than something else. You can tell your mom that you don't like the way your treated at her house even if it makes her upset. \n\nShe kicked you out: no self respecting mother kicks out a 15 year old and then has the gall to act like wanting you back is because of her good heart. It's not. She doesn't know what youre telling your dad and her reputation probably hangs on you telling the truth or lying for her. \n\nDon't lie for her.

It sounds like you have some good reasons for this decision. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should feel bad about about your choice. Your mother is behaving poorly in this situation. The first issue is that she kicked you out of the house, which is never justified. In some places it\u2019s actually illegal to kick out your underaged child. There are some extreme circumstances were a person might need to remove their child from the home but just kicking them out is not the way to do it. The other issue is how she is behaving now. It\u2019s understandable that she might be a bit upset that you are not coming back to live with her, but she needs to learn to cope with those feelings. You discussed your decision and reasoning with her but she continues to push the issue. She is going even one step further by getting your grandparent involved which, as another commenter mentioned, seems like manipulative behaviour. She should respect your choice and stop bringing it up. If she continues to behave in this way it might be a good idea to reach out to your dad and work together with him to find a solution to this problem.", "You have laid out a number of very good, logical, reasons for continuing to live with your Dad.

She might be lonely without you.", "NAH, sounds like it\u2019s tricky for everyone. Sorry. \n\nPeople talking about your Mother wanting child support money are paranoid - normally child support doesn\u2019t come close to covering the cost of a dependant. Also if she\u2019s driving you around daily she obviously isn\u2019t a deadbeat and does care. \n\nShe probably regrets asking you to leave and badly misses you - but at the same time you\u2019ve realised you\u2019re better off living with your Father and you need to prioritise your own needs. \n\nIf you want to try to find some middle ground, maybe you could stay at her place on eg a Wednesday night, or you could make time to go on walks together, etc etc - basically find a low stress, low commitment way of nurturing the relationship to be one you\u2019re happy with. \n\nIt sounds like you should also stop giving her reasons for your decision, as it will just continue the circular conversation, and it sounds like you\u2019ve made up your mind so there\u2019s no conversation to be had.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s no taking it back and there\u2019s no fixing the underlying damage.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve made the best of it and you seem in a good place with her but that doesn\u2019t change what she did and no matter how good it is with her you\u2019ll always know when push comes to shove she is capable of turning her back on you.\n\nShe made her choices she needs to live with the consequences.", "Her goal is to have you back with her.\n\nYour goal is to thrive.\n\nAsk her why her goal is to have you back with her instead of being the best version of yourself in the best health and with the best living situation.\n\nNTA", "No. You're happier at your dads. Stay there and visit your mom. You'll fight less too. A win win for both of you. Moms and daughters so often have this problem, I did with my own and I felt horrible about it. I made her move to her dads because it was the best for her and for me. We could not continue on as we had been. I saw her almost every single day anyway, the difference is, we stopped fighting. I love her, she's my daughter but we clashed and I as the adult lowered myself to her age and I didn't even realize I was doing it until later on. I wish I could have done better and I know your mom wishes it too. Just keep talking to her and maybe let her read this thread.", "NTA. She not only kicked you out, she kicked you out for...basically being fifteen. Arguing and having a messy room are super common things for teenagers! I don't love those things when my kids do them, but they don't justify kicking the kids out. \n\nYou like where you live. You see your mom often. I would advise you to live with the parent who has never kicked you out.\n\nETA: she kicked you out in FEBRUARY? Unless you're in the southern hemisphere that is a whole extra level of asshole. She decided it was fine for her to deny her minor child her roof at a time of year when people freeze to death. Please stay at your dad's.", "NTA. I'm happy you're doing better at your dad's. If your mom kicked you out, it's not reasonable for her to expect you to come back to her despite the convenience living with your dad offers. If there is a custody agreement in which your mom has the primary custody, I'd suggest getting it modified (which I presume wouldn't be as difficult since you're old enough to weigh in on which home environment you prefer), so your mom can't force you to move back in. I'm happy you have a better relationship with both your parents now. Wish you the best.", "NTA\n\nAnd your mom learned a lesson that if you kick someone out, they don't always come back.", "NTA She just wants child support money.", "Stay with your dad, you're happier, you're healthier, and you're NTAH.", "I would just wonder what the angle is? \nIs it your mom wanting childsupport money? \nWhat if its pressure from your dad maybe he would like you to go back with your mom, but doesn't want to say anything? Maybe your mom just misses you  a lot?", "my sister and brother live with my mom and my dad pays alimony", "Sure dad could but it would be so much better for this young girl to be mature and tell her mom, without any arguing exactly  how she feels and why. That's always hard for kids but imagine how strong she'll feel by being honest and mature about it. Mom might learn something.", "thank you!", "dog piss has literally seeped into the rugs. multiple of them.", "Maybe not. We don't  know the moms side. Sometimes the stress of fighting with your teen is so overwhelming and often times, like I did, we don't  handle it right. I didn't and I am sorry for it. My daughter and I are very close, we were close then too, just could not live together. She was 16, a month from 17 when I made her live with her dad and stepmom, both were great with her or I never would have done it. Parents aren't supposed to get breaks they say but omg she and I both needed it. I can't explain why we were at odds so much but I do know it was my fault, that I was acting like her age and for that I will always be sorry. Just because we're parents doesn't mean we know what the fuck we're doing but we think we should know exactly what to do and seldom do. I freely admit as the adult, as the parent, I was wrong.", "my dad pays alimony because my sister and brother both live with my mom (but they\u2019re both legal adults) but i still \u201clegally\u201d live with my mom", "She should.", "sorry this is getting many downvotes! my dad has explained he doesn\u2019t really like to be seen as the \u201cbad parent\u201d because my mom always calls him up whenever something happens between us", "My grammar was not the greatest. Should not have used better nor. Whip me with a wet noodle.", "op=NTA\n\nbut everything you write(including her threatening to lock you in a mental institution) does not indicate a \"good relationship\".\n\nI really think you and your Dad should look at your local(/state) laws to see if you are of an age to get the custody officially changed.

Since you've already explained your reasoning, the next time she or anyone else asks you to move back with her say, \"No. That's my final answer. What do you think of this weather we're having?\" The way to extinguish drama is to not fan the flames. Your mom already knows your reasoning. She doesn't need to hear it again.", "ok first off, absolutely NTA. Second, I'm sorry to break it to you, but you don't have a good relationship with your mom. A parent who threatens to lock you in a mental institution, removes your bedroom door (unless there are extreme extenuating circumstances), and kicks you out is not a parent who has a healthy relationship with their child.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even have to explain why.", "NTA. Your mom sounds super strict. Enjoy living with your dad and stepmom!", "my brother is an adult. my mom runs a business with my stepdad and gets to choose her own hours/ breaks and her schedule is very flexible", "Your Dad could possibly take her back to court to challenge the alimony, since she is living with another adult in the house who presumably has an income. It is often not legal to fail to report a change in circumstance, or to hold off on getting married just to keep getting money. If he doesn't mind, then whatever, but if he wants he should talk to his lawyer. Also NTA.", "this is hilarious", "So\u2026nope.  You deserve better.  Stay where you are and thrive!  Cheers.", "> I'm happy you have a better relationship with both your parents now.

Since she kicked u out , she can live with her decision. If it comes to court, u should be given a chance to speak so u can state where u want to live and why. Good luck", "Threatening to commit you to a mental institution is emotional and mental abuse. \nYou need to tell you dad about this. If you moon gets angry enough over whatever set her off, she may very week do it. Then lie to you dad that you don't want to see him and he'll have no idea you need help or where to look for you.  For your own protection you need to tell your dad \n\nDeliberately mixing clean and dirty clothes and telling you to wash all of them again is abuse and a power trip.\n\nYour mom kicked you out 5 months ago.  For 5 months you've been living at yourvdad's.  You've been there long enough to answer these questions: \n\nAre you less stressed at your dad's or your mom's?  \n\nWhere do you feel safest? \n\nWhere do you get better quality of sleep?  \n\nWhere do you feel the most relaxed and calm?\n\nThat's the person you should be living with.  I suspect that's your dad since you've listed why logistically better to live with you dad. As well as cooking yummy healthier foods - BTW ask your dad to teach you to cook. \n\nTell your mom that over the last 5 months with living with dad you realize living with him is a better fit. That you love your mom but you and your mom really aren't compatible living together. That you living with your dad will be less stressful on both of you and that's a good thing cause you can have a better relationship with each other.  Let your dad know you want to keep living with him if you haven't already. \n\nBe polite, be firm.  If she keeps pressuring you to move back to her home, change the topic. Ask about her boyfriend. Go on the web look some things up and ask if she ever had any interest in making taking an old table and repainting it,  decorating flower pots together, creating a rock garden,  ask questions about her first  boyfriend,  etc - don't answer all you move back,  change the topic. \n\nNTA", "NTA, your dad\u2019s house is better for you physically, mentally, and socially. If your mom keeps pushing it then threaten to have your dad amend the custody agreement in which case she would no longer get child support, and he could have the divorce paperwork revisited since she has a new man supporting her he shouldn\u2019t have to pay her alimony (tough to win since courts heavily favor the wife in divorce).", "Your mom sounds like a peace of work. Yeah, definitely don't go back, sounds like you're physically and mentally healthier with your dad!\n\nNTA", "Then maybe she shouldn't have kicked her daughter out.

Mixing the laundry together and making OP re-wash it, removing her door, getting bent out of shape over a single dish left in the sink, threatening to send OP to an institution and then kicking her out of her home. Teenage girls arguing with their moms is standard fare, but the mom\u2019s reactions to minor issues is way over the top here.

Op please stay with your dad , it's healthier for you.\n\nYour mother was abusive verbally - threatening you to lock you up or throw you out  and by removing your door.\n\nVisit but Don't move back in for your own sake. NTA", "Oh hey OP, **\"alimony\"** (also called \"spousal support\") is normally what one spouse pays the other (ex-)spouse when they split up... because the other spouse cannot earn as much thanks to the marriage and raising kids, or some other good reason. So it's totally between the two adults and has nothing to do with a kid.\n\n**Child support** is what a parent pays the other parent, if a kid (under age of majority) stays more than 60% of their time with the other parent.\n\nSo when you left Mom's household and went to Dad's, there's a good chance that Dad stopped paying child support to Mom for you. And now that the situation has continued, *Mom is supposed to pay Dad child support for you*. So that might be what's at stake financially, but I'm just guessing.\n\nThe good news is... *none of this is any of your concern, honey*. You're 15yo and not a Family Court Judge. But you get massive input -- and kind of a veto, if your grades are good and you're generally a good kid -- into where you live. So if Dad's house is way better for you, and it's in your best interests to stay there, then stay at Dad's.\n\nI'm sorry you're caught up in these dynamics, but you sound like you're old enough to learn how to handle difficult folks. Might as well start now.\n\nPlease feel free to shut down Mom, Grandma and Stepdad when they start hassling you about this -- extra points if you stay very, very calm and polite:\n\n*I don't know WHY you're pressuring me about this.* ***Mom kicked me out*** *five months ago. I obeyed her. I really don't want to talk about this anymore. And if you guys keep it up, I'm going to ask Dad to talk to his lawyer about shortening my visits here. So can we pleeeease change the subject?*\n\nGood luck OP!\n\n<ETA: no, you're NTA>"]}
