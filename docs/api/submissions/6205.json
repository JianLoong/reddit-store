What's going to happen if she goes ahead with this surgery now, receives a desirable result, only for her nose to continue to grow into something undesirable? Noses are delicate things, there's only so many times they can be interfered with, and every time you you do you permanently damage the structural integrity of the cartilage, the sinuses, and the skin, and I will be the first to tell you that the recovery is fucking harrowing. \n\nThis is not good parenting.

Where mom knows the pain of being told to love yourself and all the platitudes, the pendulum swung too far.

Its really no one's business and getting it done before college should mean she moves into adult life with a lot more confidence.", "NTA.\n\n\nRegardless of your consent or not, there's a high possibility that your daughter would go ahead with a nose job either now or later in life. Her insecurity about her own nose could have been influenced by your own past insecurities despite efforts to conceal your nose job from her or the disparity between her nose and yours. However, it's not necessarily your fault she wants plastic surgery either. With your consent, you are in a position of trust to advise and look after your daughter. There's too many horror stories of underage, less than legal nose jobs out there so at least this way she's safe. At 17 though, I do think this is a bit young. Facial growth usually ceases or slows down once you turn 18 I believe so perhaps waiting until she's 18 would be wiser. I would also suggest using a certified plastic surgeon, if you haven't, for the nose job so that they can accurately assess and construct an image of what her face will look like with her new nose after surgery for her to look at before she decides on plastic surgery. If you've already considered all this and you're both happy with your decision then nothing else matters. At least you can guide her through her nose job with your consent than risk having her finding other possible ways or feeling insecure in her appearance.", "I wouldn't necessarily call you an AH but the fact that you started putting money away so early makes it seem like you are subconsciously projecting your insecurities on her. I mean you always just assumed your kids would hate that part of themselves and kinda acts like that was inevitable and that your son is the outlier for not caring. I mean you even said you think the compliments are patronizing, but did she ever really think that? Idk this seems like something that should be delt with emotionally first and not jumping into surgery so young. Especially because if you don't love yourself, no amount of surgery is ever gonna to make you happy and you might just become obsessed with an impossible standard in your head.", "NTA- but stop telling people about it, it\u2019s none of their business.", "NTA\n\nBut make sure she understands the risks and limitations.

There's no point in making her suffer with a hated feature if you have the means to help her fix the problem. This is not just about vanity, but very real suffering that you can relate to because you experienced it yourself.\n\nJust be sure to do your research about the best time to do that kind of surgery, and follow doctors' recommendations. There might be a medical reason for waiting until she's reached the end of her teenage growth period. Do what it takes to get the best long-term result.", "NTA\n\nI vote NTA because even though I think she's young it sounds as if she has been unhappy with herself because of her nose for a long time. She's lucky her parents are understanding of this. Also because I can empathize as I would dearly love to have an eye lift. \ud83e\udd23", "Does your sister think that an oscillating fan is the best graduation present ever?\n\nNTA", "NTA please continue to be a good mom. Listening to your daughter and understanding her feelings is way more important than your sister's incredibly biased opinion. And your mom kind of sucks for not telling your sister it's none of her damn business girl, step down.", "NAH, but I honestly urge you to encourage your daughter to wait until her body is fully matured.  She is still a literal child.  I hated my nose my entire life.  HATED.  At 10 I wanted a nose job.  Told my parents that\u2019s what my savings would be intended for.  I\u2019m 31 and never got the nose job.  Why?  Because I grew into myself.  My nose is beautiful and a part of my genetics.  I think she should wait, personally.  Until like 20 minimum.  And please stop sharing your daughters medical endeavors with everyone.", ">my sister refuses to speak to me\n\nProbably cause you completely debunked her argument and she's busy seething over the fact", "I only say YTA because why do so many people know? If she's so self conscious why is this a community decision?", "My mom gave me a nose job as a birthday present. She wrote \u201cnose job\u201d on a piece of paper and wrapped it up for me to open in front of my friends. I did not give her the response she was looking for. Also, mine was to correct damage from multiple breaks.", "I never understood why people need to gossip about their kid's medical issues.\n\nNTA, But the OP needs to stop talking.", "But if relatives suddenly see her with  different nose, do you think they are going to be nice about it, or do you think they are going to ask the daughter all these questions, judge her on her new nose etc? Is it not easier to try to deal with all of this beforehand? Rather than leave it for the daughter to deal with when she is getting used to (and hopefully getting happy with) her new nose.", "I didn't like my nose as a young girl either. I was picked on a lot for my nose. I then realized I had the same nose as my grandma and she was so beautiful and it somehow changed the way I saw my nose. I didn't hate it anymore anyway, but my self esteem was still not great. Then my daughter came along. She is the spitting image of me. (Only she's a thousand times more beautiful) It's totally surreal most days because it's like looking into a mirror with a time machine. She's stunningly beautiful to me. So I can't really hate my nose anymore can I? Not when the exact same nose sits right on the most beautiful face in the world.", "As someone who has always hated my nose (I'm mid 20s now) and plan to get a nose job in the future, I agree. I do think she should wait a bit longer, maybe go to therapy too if she isn't already. There really isn't a rush, if she decides she wants one in a few years there's no harm in waiting, especially because just the knowledge you can change it in the future might help ease the insecurity (from my experience). \n\nAlso, and more importantly, my wants for a nose job have changed over the years, although my want for one has never changed. When I was younger I wanted a much more dramatic change than I prefer now. My nose has a cultural look to it (ugh I'm sure people can guess) and while I'd make changes I'd keep the overall aesthetic there, whereas at 17 I definitely wouldn't have.", "Right. Easy analogy here with weight/body image. My dad was actually the lunatic when it came to this issue (for himself too, not only about me/women), and my mom always says \"I tried to stop him from messing you up about this,\" but who was the one saying \"oh that dress will look good when you get some control top pantyhose?\" She was. Parents are often totally oblivious to the messages they're sending.\n\nOP, maybe look up what Bella Hadid has said about her regrets over her nose job and share that with your daughter. I'm not saying she shouldn't go ahead, but it's one way to encourage your daughter to think through the permanence of a choice like this at a young age.", "Yes. Its a huge culture now of plastic surgery and influencers.. fillers , plastic surgeries. I don't mind it , if I could afford it I'd probably get some fillers , lashes and brows myself. \n\nBut it's also a very toxic habit to form. Look at everyone online these days? It's not bad to want to feel good about yourself but it's the addicting part these people don't really talk about.... maybe a mental battle of insecurities ? Maybe OCD from the lips or nostrils not being symmetrical?  \n\nI dont know, but I know it can be a very addicting thing especially exposed at a young age. Tread lightly mom.. next will be the lips then cheeks.", "I mean, the definition of shallowness is putting disproportionate value on superficial appearance traits... So I don't see how approving of a teenager getting surgery because her nose doesn't match an arbitrary standard of beauty, could be defined as anything *but* shallow.   \n\n\nHer post is dripping with her attitude towards her daughters nose, saying she has 'bad genes' and there was 'no hope' for her to be born with a pretty nose, and that she planned from when her daughter was a child to encourage and pay for her to fix what she perceived as a problem, and that she didn't believe it when she told her daughter she'd be beautiful regardless. This is NOT a decision the daughter is making independently.", "OP is free to tell people about her own business.\n\nThe really egregious thing here is she's telling people about her daughter's business.\n\nI have no problem with rhinoplasty and recommend a few consultations before deciding on a surgeon.  Perhaps she'll be told to wait a year or two.\n\nI suspect my own daughter will want the same surgery.  I don't talk to her about it other than to say it's her decision when and if she wants it.  I certainly won't be telling family members about it as it's not my place to do so.", "Do you think the family is not going to figure it out on their own after the fact if she hadn't gone ahead and told them? That's not really something you can exactly hide. She's going to have a completely different nose so everyone who knows her is going to know she got a nose job.", "Yeah, I feel like reddit can't make a judgement here. Is the nose actually abnormally large and making her life more difficult? Or does it just not look like an instagram filter nose (which is basically a eurocentric-beauty-ideal nose ratio'd down even further). At the very least, I hope OP and her daughter take the time to really research surgeons and find someone who is ethical, honest, and non-pushy. 17 year olds aren't don't growing, so I would want answers about any possible issues there, too.", "But it\u2019s a mental health issue. Low self esteem is very destructive. Especially to teenage girls!", "I wholeheartedly agree with this based on my experience.\n\nI had always hated my nose because my siblings bullied me for it and made silly comparisons to make me feel bad. Heck, even my mum poked fun at my nose. It really took a toll on my self esteem and made me more eager to approve of a surgery early on.\n\nThankfully I did not have the finance to cover such fees as it gave me the time to rethink my decision as I grew older. Now (in my 20s), strangers even complimented my nose which bamboozled me at first but made me realize that my nose perfectly fits my facial features.\n\nIt seems that everyone wants something off someone else's features that is anything but their own. It's a rather irrational insecurity, one that is merely learnt through time and/or with professional help.\n\nOP should've sought professional advice from a psychologist before jumping straight to approve of a nose job for her daughter.", "I don't get why you're being downvoted, you're right. It's obvious that her insecurities about her nose are directly from her mother.   \n\n\nIt's the same as the posts about mothers who 'encourage' their teen girls into restrictive dieting, and claim that they're just doing what's 'best' for them because she obviously wouldn't be pretty otherwise. Reddit acknowledges how that's a recipe for body dysmorphia and self esteem issues, how is this any different beyond the change being more permanent?", "That's not a gift, mom, that's an f'ing medical procedure!!! \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "May I ask why that changes anything?\n\nThere is nothing legally binding about rhinoplasty.  I don't think someone who is 18 is that much more mature than someone who is 17 and a half.", "Right, like nobody is going to notice the daughter suddenly has a completely different nose? She told them bc they're all going to find out anyway when the daughter goes through surgery, has brusing as she heals and then her nose is totally different.", "If that were true then she wouldn't be on reddit being stressed about other people's reactions.", "Agree. As someone who had plastic surgery to correct a medical issue (which should be covered by insurance, but that\u2019s another discussion) - I\u2019ve been really careful how I phrase things around my kids. It did come with a significant aesthetic aspect, which is obvious and obviously my kids know I had surgery (they watched me recover and have seen the scars.) So when I talk about it I make sure to mention that it fixed something that was hurting me and made me unable to function, not because I was unhappy.", "It\u2019s also perfectly possible the daughter just actually wanted it.\n\nRhinoplasty is super common, and is more common than other purely cosmetic procedures to be the only one people get. It can be a slippery slope to be sure, but it does seem a bit condescending to just act like the only possible reason is unhealthy.\n\nI view it like tattoos. If not being done to fix deep seated issues (which it won\u2019t solve), then who am I to judge.", "I agree with you on principal- yes, OP can tell people whatever she wishes about her own business, but when it comes to anyone else, especially medical, and her daughter\u2019s medical business at that, she should not divulge that information. \n\nBut, I think it\u2019s good general advice to refrain from information diarrhea. Knowing what information to share and what to keep quiet is a special skill that a lot of people don\u2019t have. That goes for knowing which people to trust (that\u2019s expert level, so to err on the side of caution: trust no one with any sort of information you don\u2019t wish to hear about later, from people you didn\u2019t tell in the first place). \n\nIt\u2019s safe to say, if you don\u2019t value or want someone\u2019s opinion, or can\u2019t trust they won\u2019t run their mouth, don\u2019t share your info with them.", "It is - but the jump should not immediately be to a nose job. In fact, a plastic surgeon who does surgery on someone who has low self esteem and is looking to fix a mental health issue would be a terrible doctor. \n\nLet me give you an example. \n\nI had lots of body image issues growing up and a fucked up relationship with food. My eating disorder landed me in the hospital and several partial programs. My depression and anxiety has led to self harm and suicide attempts. I am no stranger to low self esteem and mental health issues. \n\nAfter having babies I was diagnosed with severe diastasis recti. Basically, this means my ab muscles never came back together. I had a 10cm gap. (Fun party trick - I could lay down and put my whole hand in between my abs). I looked 6 months pregnant all the time. I got comments about my pregnant belly all the time. It was detrimental to my self esteem, especially with my past issues. Not only that, the pain from the separation and hernia and back pain was awful. I couldn\u2019t exercise. I couldn\u2019t get on the ground and play with my kids. My mental health was in the toilet. I cried when I looked in the mirror. I took showers in the dark. I wore clothes 3 sizes too big just so maybe someone wouldn\u2019t ask when I was due, 3 years after my last kid was born. \n\nThe only real fix for my issue? Tummy tuck. Considered completely cosmetic. \n\nUntil I fixed my issues with my body and mind, no surgeon would perform surgery on me. They saw how crappy my mental health was and knew surgery would not fix it. I did about 2 years worth of work with an NP, therapists and a RD before I had my surgery. But I had to get in the right mindset in order to reap the physical benefits of surgery."]}
