What's going to happen if she goes ahead with this surgery now, receives a desirable result, only for her nose to continue to grow into something undesirable? Noses are delicate things, there's only so many times they can be interfered with, and every time you you do you permanently damage the structural integrity of the cartilage, the sinuses, and the skin, and I will be the first to tell you that the recovery is fucking harrowing. \n\nThis is not good parenting.

Where mom knows the pain of being told to love yourself and all the platitudes, the pendulum swung too far.

Its really no one's business and getting it done before college should mean she moves into adult life with a lot more confidence.", "NTA.\n\n\nRegardless of your consent or not, there's a high possibility that your daughter would go ahead with a nose job either now or later in life. Her insecurity about her own nose could have been influenced by your own past insecurities despite efforts to conceal your nose job from her or the disparity between her nose and yours. However, it's not necessarily your fault she wants plastic surgery either. With your consent, you are in a position of trust to advise and look after your daughter. There's too many horror stories of underage, less than legal nose jobs out there so at least this way she's safe. At 17 though, I do think this is a bit young. Facial growth usually ceases or slows down once you turn 18 I believe so perhaps waiting until she's 18 would be wiser. I would also suggest using a certified plastic surgeon, if you haven't, for the nose job so that they can accurately assess and construct an image of what her face will look like with her new nose after surgery for her to look at before she decides on plastic surgery. If you've already considered all this and you're both happy with your decision then nothing else matters. At least you can guide her through her nose job with your consent than risk having her finding other possible ways or feeling insecure in her appearance.", "I wouldn't necessarily call you an AH but the fact that you started putting money away so early makes it seem like you are subconsciously projecting your insecurities on her. I mean you always just assumed your kids would hate that part of themselves and kinda acts like that was inevitable and that your son is the outlier for not caring. I mean you even said you think the compliments are patronizing, but did she ever really think that? Idk this seems like something that should be delt with emotionally first and not jumping into surgery so young. Especially because if you don't love yourself, no amount of surgery is ever gonna to make you happy and you might just become obsessed with an impossible standard in your head.", "NTA- but stop telling people about it, it\u2019s none of their business.", "NTA\n\nBut make sure she understands the risks and limitations.
