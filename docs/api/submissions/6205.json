When I married my husband who also was not blessed with great nose genes, I knew my kids didn\u2019t have much hope. I decided that if my kids decided they wanted to change their nose the money and support would be there. \n\nI want to be clear I never told my Children they had a bad nose my son is completely fine with his nose, but my daughter from a young age, like myself, decided she did not like her nose. Of course I told her she was beautiful and re assured her, but as someone who has gone through it it\u2019s patronising and annoying. So I told her when she was old enough she could get a nose job and I would fully support it. \n\nShe is 17 currently, she has a consultation next week. She\u2019s very excited and I\u2019m happy that she\u2019s happy. My husband was iffy at first but he also supports her choice. \n\nI\u2019ve met lots of bad reactions, telling me I\u2019m shallow and a bad mother and caused her to hate herself. I feel like people meet plastic surgery with lots of hostility, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m forcing it on her and it\u2019s not like she\u2019s getting a ton done, just something that may help her feel better. \n\nI\u2019m letting her get it done young because the only regret I have about changing my nose is not doing it sooner. I\u2019m not making her wait years for somethings she knows she wants as I want her to feel her best self, especially while she is young. \n\nMy sister was furious and called me a bad mother, saying she only hates her nose because I changed my nose so now she wants to. But I changed my nose before she was even born, so she didn\u2019t even know until after she first told me she disliked her nose, my sister refuses to speak to me. My mum sees where both of us are coming from\n\nI want to gather others opinions on this, if there would be any benefit of making her wait.

Stop it, **you don't need their approval**. All that matters is your daughter is happy with it and wants to do it.", "I dunno, even though you say you\u2019ve never made her feel bad about her nose, your eager approval for her to get a nose job is an unspoken validation of her insecurities itself. Also, she\u2019s still 17 and her face isn\u2019t fully grown yet. She\u2019s still learning what hairstyles/makeup look good on her. And more importantly, she has so much potential to learn how to love herself.\n\nNAH \u2014 you\u2019re not necessarily an asshole but you might be making the wrong decision for your child. A nose job for someone that young is kind of a huge deal.", "NTA, but for fucks sake, why are you getting so many reactions?  Why are you even discussing your daughters upcoming medical procedure with anyone other than her?   \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be getting any reactions because you simply should not be talking about this with anyone.", "NTA...also, not your sister's business nor concern.", "why are you involving so many people in this? it's between you, her dad, her, and her doctor. why does your sister or mom even know about her private medical life?", "NTA\n\nBut stop telling other people your daughter's business. You've created an unnecessary situation by involving other people.", "NTA, I'm not really a fan of plastic surgery for minors \u2013 I know it's a small amount of time but I think it'd be better if she was 18 \u2013 but I know lots of people who got nosejobs and it really did make them feel better about themselves, including in one case where I *literally* can't see the difference except in attitude. If she hates it she should go for it.\n\nDid you contribute to her hating her nose? Idunno, maybe subconsciously but people hate their appearance for all sorts of reasons. And some people objectively have noses that aren't conventionally attractive and it's OK to want to change that. As long as this doesn't send her down some body-altering spiral, it's fine.", "NTA. You know exactly what your daughter is going through, which your sister does not. Also, you are the mother. You've obviously put a lot of time and thought into this decision.", "NTA.\n\nThe only person's opinion that matters here is your daughter.", "NTA\n\nBut can I offer a suggestion? Stop telling people your business. In your daughter\u2019s case, this is a medical matter, and shouldn\u2019t be discussed anyway. \n\nWhat\u2019s to keep you from telling people to bug off and to mind their business?", "NTA\n\nYour nose, your business, your daughter's nose, your daughter's business.\n\nYou've been there, so you can support her every step of the way and help her make good decisions.", "I can't decide if you're an AH or not, but the people calling you shallow and a bad mother definitely are. The thing with plastic surgery is I don't think a typical 17yr old can properly judge the risks vs reward. Especially in the Instagram filter generation. Also, her body isn't done developing, including her nose. I don't think it's wrong to help her pay for it, I'm just unsure if it would be better to expect her to wait a few years.  \n\nI suggest you talk to the doctor at the consultation about whether or not it'd be better to hold off on the surgery. A good plastic surgeon will have an honest conversation and won't agree to do the surgery if they think it's like not to turn out well, or the patient isn't properly considering risk vs reward.", "NTA and sorry but I can't help saying others should keep their noses out of your business.", "I personally wouldn't let my child get a cosmetic procedure as teenager unless it was needed for health reasons. However, it's your kid and it's your choice to do that. So maybe just stop telling people. It doesn't concern them and their opinions don't matter cause you're the parent.", "NTA.   You told her she could get a nose job when she was old enough. She's old enough and wants to get one.  She's covered under your insurance, you're paying for it.  (if your insurance doesn't cover nose jobs, that is.)   Your sister has nothing to do with any of this.", "NTA. These people need to mind their business.", "I hated my nose growing up and my mom told me the same thing she supported me getting a nose job but she wanted me to wait until I was a little older so she had me start off with a nose ring and it made me love my nose and now I don\u2019t want a nose job. Maybe something to think about and consider", "I struggled over this one.\n\nI really dislike the importance given to appearance and cosmetic procedures.  But it is a (sad) reality of this world.\n\nI'm with your mum, really.\n\nI wanted to vote that you are the TA, but I will hold my nose (so to speak!) and say NAH.  It is not anything I would ever do or want for any hypothetical child, though.", "ESH but only because you're discussing this with other people. Your daughter (and you, as her parent - since she is still a minor) are the only ones concerned here. Go forth and rhinoplasty.", "Impossible to say without seeing the nose =P when I was around 15-16, a girl at our school got surgery to reduce the size of her chin.

That\u2019s all who should be consulted in the conversation.", "Honestly I'm on the fence. The nose job thing gets out of hand; I've known gorgeous women who wanted a nose job because they obsessed over it their whole life while looking perfectly beautiful. So it's possible you're really just part of the problem. On the other hand I know how cruel the world is to the unattractive in any way and your tone just sounds like you're accepting a reality.

I'm 63 now and am still very happy I got it done when I did.\n\nMy parents weren't sure I needed one, but my plastic surgeon was an old family friend and said I did. Your daughter is old enough to make this decision, ignore the critics.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2018m sorry, but you caused your daughter these insecurities and are teaching her that beauty surgeries are a good thing. She\u2018s still a minor. Put yourself aside and do what\u2018s best for HER. And a nose job certainly won\u2018t solve the actual problem.", "NTA.\n\nIs it a rhinoplasty your daughter is going for? Look, nobody can say just how bad the nose is online, but what about the potential of a less permanent cosmetic procedure while she\u2019s still young? I\u2019m sure somebody will correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I believe you\u2019re able to use filler on a nose and still have a good if not similar outcome than a full nose job?\n\nHonestly though, it kind of is up to her I think you\u2019re good parents for supporting her, and coming here makes you an even better parent questioning if you\u2019re doing the right thing. \n\nI have the same nose as my own mother, I grew into mine when I aged into my 20s so after near a decade of hating my face, I honestly think I\u2019m pretty now \ud83d\ude01 but you know your daughter more than anyone, and you know the nose better too.

My mom and dad and stepmom did this to me and now I have people asking me over and over about things that I would rather not talk about, because so many people know. \n\nIt won\u2019t be healthy for your daughter in the long run if too many people know her medical business.
