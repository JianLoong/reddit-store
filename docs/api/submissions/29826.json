What was your bil going to do if you didn't answer? Not to mention it doesn't matter if you think ot was a joke or not, June clearly doesn't and nowhere in this have you explained how you looked after her.", "YTA\n\nWhile your BIL  was vile too asking this question,  you were completely in the wrong answering it. You should've went with you'd drown trying to save them both.", "Of course you\u2019re the AH. You\u2019ve made one of your children feel as if you favour the other. Jokes are supposed to be humorous. Have you even apologised?", "YTA\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t put your children at the expense of a joke, even if you were pushed into it. It would seem to June, that you favour Summer over her, and in this hypothetical situation you wouldn\u2019t save her. That sucks. You should apologise to her, even if you didn\u2019t realise she was standing there", "You and your BIL are the AH. Children lives should never be used a joke.", "YTA. Don't say things at the expense of your children.", "Yta", "YTA and the fact you don\u2019t know this makes YTA and you had to ask this makes YTA again.", "I just gonna assume you\u2018re over 30. Like seriously, which grown adult with kids would play and ask such a ridiculous question? Let alone answer this question?! What the fucking hell! Every single person I know would tear me an absolute new one if I\u2018d casually ask which of their kids they would let drown. Wtf. \n\nIf this is real, you are all colossal assholes. Like enormous. YTA", "YTA\n\nYou ain't explaining your way out of this by passing it up as a joke. The damage has been done, it was said and can't be unsaid.\n\nJust because you didn't see her behind you is not an excuse either.\n\nExpect June to remain very distant until she is 18 and walks away from you.", "Did they put a gun to your head and \"made you answer\"?\n\nAlso, a joke is when *everyone* is laughing, including the person the \"joke\" is about. Otherwise you just said an incredibly dumb thing. YTA", "\"Well, seeing as June's mom doesn't love her, I'd let her die because it'd be more convenient than letting her live. Hahaha!\"\n\nOoh boy, you are a gaper of an AH.\n\nYTA", "Talk to June, even if she's not talking to you. Don't trust apologies and excuses you've already made, talk to her. Tell her how precious she is to you, and how you'll do your GD best to always be there for her. Tell her how you know she misses her mother and that you wish her mother was still in her life, too. Remind her that she's allowed to talk to you about anything. And that she's allowed to be angry with you, that you still love her. \n\nYou shouldn't have been goaded into answering that question.. It's okay if you have a favourite child but that should be a secret you tell no one, yet alone at a party where any children are present. YTA", "YTA\n\nthere is a saying in Russian the translates to \u201cthere\u2019s a grain of truth in every joke\u201d. I\u2019m not surprised June took offence in that joke.  \nyou could have just as easily stood your ground, tell them to cut it out, or even stop playing that game, and even ask your siblings to leave if they persisted, but instead you chose to tell a joke about something You know is a sore spot for June, and conveys that you won\u2019t have her back and she is alone. don\u2019t be surprised if she will find it hard to trust you for some time now.\n\ngo talk to June and see how you can make it up to her.", "YTA\n\nJune seems to have some unresolved emotional issues because her mother abandoned her. She probably feels inferior to her sister, because one of her parents doesn't want her. And you just told her you thought the same, like \"I would save Summer because she has a mother.\"", "I think you know what you did\u2026. Is this a real question? Yes you are a huge asshole. Maybe next time you joke around like that, make sure the kid isn\u2019t near you.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nSeriously, what is your major malfunction?
