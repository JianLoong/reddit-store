It was bad enough that the sub took down all their names and sent most of them to the principal's office.

I told her to hand it in and made an appointment with the principal and teacher. \nAt the meeting, I explained what happened to the principal and my child's response. I said that I expected that she not get into trouble for it or have issues come from it because I believe she is correct. Mrs. P asked why I thought this was acceptable, I explained that it's not a child's responsibility to stop other kids in class from acting up since not only does it make my child a target for those kids once the sub leaves but it's not her job to manage and regulate the emotions of her classmates, particularly since it's against someone who is in a position of authority. By staying out of it, she  didn't escalate the situation by involving herself in something she wasn't a part of and possibly making it worse. My child has a responsibility to tell a teacher about bullying, but when it's the teacher being bullied what do they expect her to do? I felt like it was also worth mentioning that all the children acting up were boys, so they were expecting the girls to do the emotional labor for the boys by what? Chastising them for misbehaving in class? And then apologizing, like not doing that emotional labor was wrong. \nThe principal agreed with me and told me not to worry about it but the teacher has been difficult ever since. \nI was sure that I was right but a few friends think I'm wrong for taking it to the principal and more than one has said I didn't have to imply that it was a sexism issue. The biggest thing that has me doubting myself is that I was discussing with a friend that my child stands up to bullies when it comes to other kids being bullied, it's who she's always been and I'm proud of that. My friend called me a hypocrite for encouraging her to stand up to bullies for other kids but not for a teacher.

As a parent myself, I would like to think I would have done the same.

It shouldn\u2019t be their responsibility to put themselves in harms way for the sake of anyone else.  It\u2019s not their job. It\u2019s the teachers and administration. If things weren\u2019t being handled appropriately on behalf of the sub, then the teacher needs to bring her concerns to admin for resolution. The unruly kids are old enough to know that being respectful is the bare minimum that should have been done.

And the letter from the 12 year old, MAGNIFICENT!!", "First: NTA. It\u2019s not up to your child to defend a teacher. But, and I probably will be downvoted for this, I do think you and your child would have made a stronger point if you had presented it in a kinder way and show some sympathy for the substitute. To me, and this may be cultural, the letter of your child comes across as an attack at a substitute teacher that was already bullied and looking for a fight. I would teach my child to start with showing a little empathy before making my point: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you\u2026 \u201c In my experience, again this may be regional, your point would have been taken much better that way.", "NTA\n\nYou are spot on with your assessment and I would have done exactly the same thing.  \n\nThe teacher is salty because the principal now knows what she did.  If you didn't make that appointment, the principal would be none the wiser.\n\nThe substitute needs some support.  They are struggling.  But it's not up to the well behaved kids in the class to police the other kids who are doing the wrong thing.", "NTA, as a teacher! Being a sub is tough but it's not other students' responsibility to stand up for a teacher.\n\nBut if a teacher is now being difficult, consider switching to anither class. Some grownups think it's okay to be vindictive towards kids.", "NTA at at all. You're your child's advocate. Every word you said is valid. The principle agreed. If the teacher persists in treating your daughter poorly, then you may need to go back to the principle and ask that your daughter switch classes. He probably won't do anything about the teacher. They rarely do. So, good job, Momma Bear!", "This actually makes me feel a lot better so thank you. My daughter is autistic so it's hard to teach her how to navigate social situations on a normal day, much less ones where the teacher is so against her. The friend that said I'm teaching her it's ok to stand up for some and not others is another parent of a child in the spectrum and I look to her for advice a lot so I was really worried I was teaching her the wrong thing here.", "Did you seriously just compare a bunch of rowdy preteen boys to nazis and my child to a passive sympathizer?", "I\u2019m finally being tested for neurodivergence now as I\u2019m approaching 40.  But the complete honesty and ingenuousness of your daughter\u2019s essay reminded me so much of my own early years where I would be told I did something wrong \u2014 and the something wrong that I did was point out how batshit crazy the \u201cnormal\u201d behavior was.\n\nYour daughter is right.  The substitute teacher did not have control of the class, and apparently did not take action with administration to exercise their authority to discipline and take control of the class.\n\nAs a result, the students who wanted to learn lost instructional time.\n\nThe substitute left specific notes of misbehaving students so the teacher could deal with it on her return.  The teacher decided that it was an \u201ceverybody problem\u201d and her solution was to punish everybody.\n\nExcept, there\u2019s no way to know that if your daughter or other students in the class started trying to stop the misbehaving students, that it wouldn\u2019t have devolved into the kids raising their voices at each other.  I\u2019ve seen it happen when a teacher is using \u201cwait time\u201d to quiet a class.  2-3 kids keep goofing off, and a quiet kid who wants to learn says \u201cstop.  She\u2019s waiting.\u201d  Which then cause the goof offs to escalate and bring more people in, and then some of the other quiet kids get annoyed and start saying \u201cwhy do you always have to be like this?  You know what Mrs. P expects!\u201d And the whole thing devolves with the kids who are trying to quiet the goofballs getting in the same trouble as the goofballs, because \u201cthey aren\u2019t the teacher and should have left to to the adult to deal with.\u201d\n\nAt which point, the neurodivergent child says, \u201cI tried that, but the adult didn\u2019t do anything and I wanted to learn/go to recess/go to music.\u201d  And then gets in trouble for being disrespectful.\n\nBasically, a terrible sub is the worst possible situation for a neurodivergent child \u2014 because it\u2019s a situation in which the social order they are learning and depend on has completely broken down.  If they try to \u201chelp,\u201d they\u2019re disrespecting the adult\u2019s authority and being a buttinsky know-it-all, and get targeted by their classmates.  If they stay out of it, they\u2019re a bystander and as guilty as those who are actively disrupting and get disciplined by the adults.  While this is true of neurotypical students as well, the injustice of it typically strikes ND folks much more deeply because they are trying to learn social rules and they\u2019ve been put into an unwinnable situation where none of the normal rules apply. \n\nYour daughter spoke truth to power because she\u2019s been taught that truth is a good thing.  Power often doesn\u2019t like Truth being pushed in its face, and uses every excuse in the book to discount Truth.\n\nThank you for backing her up.", "These comparisons are getting more and more casual, istg.

The lesson of that story is how they taught my generation to stand up for others. In this instance, the teacher used an actual lived experience of the kids, and people are still up in arms about it. It's the same lesson, just a different approach.", "Except it isn't a good comparison at all.  It was never those kids' job to stand up for the teacher.  The teacher had all the power there, and resources for if they could not maintain control of the classroom.", "Really? I was taught to stand up for anyone who is being bullied.

The teacher was using a situation that all kids experience to teach them a lesson about standing up for others by asking them to evaluate what happened and why they did or did not do something. Is that really a punishment?\n\n How is this wrong?", ">The teacher was using a situation that all kids experience to teach them a lesson about standing up for others by asking them to evaluate what happened and why they did or did not do something\n\nNo that's not what the OP wrote, this is what the teacher asked the kids who weren't not bullying the sub teacher to do.\n\n> he kids who didn't do anything were told to write an apology for not stepping in and standing up to the 'bullies' on behalf of the teacher.\n\nThe teacher asked the good kids to write an apology for not standing up to the 'bullies' on behalf of the teacher. \n\n**This was not an assignment on what they could or could not have done better in the face of someone bullying someone else.  This was a *Letter of APOLOGY to the sub teacher* that would be *given* to the sub teacher to make her feel better.**\n\nThe good kids (remember the OP's daughter is a pre-teen) shouldn't be apologizing to the sub teacher because it is not their responsibility to stand up to the bullies or to try to modify the bullies behavior towards an **adult** who was **in charge of the classroom**", "And the child correctly explained that it isn't her responsibility to defend a teacher. The teacher has the power, and she allowed the teacher to exercise that power. If anything, stepping in could have undermined the teachers authority and caused even more bullying.\n\nIt sounds like this kid steps in and tries to stop bullying when it happens to other students when there isn't a teacher around to do it. I don't see what the problem is.\n\nIt wasn't just a \"teachable moment\". The teacher was asking for the student to write an apology. An apology inherently implies that a person did something wrong which requires the apology. OPs kid wrote a letter saying that they wouldn't apologize because they didn't do anything wrong.\n\nI can empathize with the situation. It was our last home game and our marching band wore white socks instead of black for fun as a gag. One of the parent helpers took it personally and got so upset that she accidentally slammed her own hand in a door and had to go to the hospital. She demanded an apology or she would stop volunteering and we were all told that we needed to sign a sheet with all our names on it, I refused.\n\nIt never could be explained to me how it was the responsibility of teenagers to control the emotional regulation of an adult, and how wearing white socks was designed to attack her personally, despite the band teacher and the other dozen parent volunteers getting a kick out of it before the one parent ran off throwing a fit and injuring herself.\n\nIt isn't the responsibility of the students to protect the teachers. The responsibility goes the other way around.", "I'm sorry I missed the part where she said these letters were being given to anyone.

I don\u2019t think I would have assigned it quite the same way (I can\u2019t imagine myself telling the kids to think about how to stand up to their peers bullying an adult), but I can see myself having the whole class write a letter because frankly if I wasn\u2019t there I don\u2019t accurately know who was involved.

Making them apologize, like the bullies, equates them all with the bullies.  \n\nCould a child stand up to the bullies?  Sure.

No admin response or help. \n\nKid told parents I was being ableist which was either an outright lie or a misunderstanding, not quite sure which. I think he misunderstood what I said (it was art class and I was trying to suggest slightly different poses he could use in his wheelchair instead of standing, obviously, somehow he thought I was saying he couldn\u2019t participate if he couldn\u2019t stand\u2014mad at the teacher for not writing in instructions for him bc she knew). Started screaming that all of this was r*tarded while at the other end of the table from several intellectual disabled classmates.

In this case the teacher had more power than her so standing up would not help the teacher and just make her a target as you said. If a grown man was assaulting someone on the street, that's not a bully she should stand up to either. At best she could try to get help in such a situation. She does need to know how to prioritize her safety while also fulfilling the ethical obligation to not be a passive bystander when someone is being bullied if there's anything you can do to make a difference.

She said some things to her class that scared many of the students, including mine, some students refused to come to class the next day and my child had to be talked into it after her and a few other students told us what the teacher had said. When we emailed and called the principal about the incident the teacher said the kids must not have understood what she was really saying and then gaslit the kids, so many of them started to believe that they misheard her, even when one recorded some of it. Nothing was done to the teacher and they refused to move my or any of the other kids to a new teacher.", "Thank you, I really hate this sometimes and I've been on Reddit for comments but not really posting.", "Lots of assumptions here! \nFirst, I went to the principal instead of email or call because that is what I've done in the past with this and another teacher and I still have problems with them and their treatment of my child. This teacher has gaslit and targeted my child before and I wanted to try to stop it before it could happen this time. \nSecond, I clearly stated that the teacher had come back to class and had the students write these letters. I didn't take her from anything, I was even mindful and made the appointment for her free period so she wouldn't be taken away from her students.\nThird, my child is well aware that the teacher has power. The point in teaching her to come to me in situations like this so I can handle it for her is that the teacher here has power and she doesn't, but I do. I have taught her that if she is in a situation where she has no power to defend herself to find someone with power willing to stand up for her. Otherwise I'm just teaching her to eat shit and take it without complaint because she doesn't have power. She even clearly states that the teacher has power in her letter. \nForth and finally, I want her to be able to come to me if she has issues with a teacher. Having her duke it out with a teacher in class is what undermines the teacher. Having me handle the issue for her preserves the teachers authority over the students while also showing the teacher that her constant targeting of my special needs child is not acceptable and I am happy to go over her head to stop it.", "This is my first real post to Reddit so I knew there was a character limit and tried to include the most important bits but didn't cover everything.", "This is why so many teachers are leaving the field and it is impossible to get subs. I am retiring in May.  The last two years have been glorious with amazing students and supportive parents, but the year before that was a doozy and I teach PreK!  We are having administration changes so I'm going out on a postive note.", "You are correct.  I missed that she sent them to the principal's office.  (Unless it is like my school was, where the principal would send them back to class right away, which is a separate problem.)\n\nOkay, so I'm going to double down on Mrs. P., then.  Mrs. P didn't want to do work the day after she was out.  So, since a large portion of the class misbehaved, she wanted them to write a letter.  And she didn't want to come up with something else for everyone to do, so she just said, \"you were all wrong!\" because she could justify it in her mind.\n\nI've watched coworkers create punishments for entire classes before.  It's insane.", "Im just pointing out the flaws in your preferred life lesson, you seem to be saying 12 year old children should be taught if they see adults being harrassed/ bullied they should intervene.", "Wow, this is just way too much more awful. Escalate! School board, Superintendent, maybe local media?", "Yep easy peasy - the standard assistive stuff on phones and computers has gotten pretty good, and the specialized software and hardware even more impressive - I have a colleague who has motor issues and is a radiologist but is able to do their job nearly hands free.", "Thanks for proving my point! So multiple teachers have targeted your child and have \u201cgaslit\u201d your child?\n\nHow many teachers do you have problems with? Sounds like a few? \n\nSounds like this pattern of perceived wrong \u2014\u2014> call/email principal is normal for you.  Unless I read that wrong? The wording is confusing here.\n\nHer free period? That\u2019s her prep, that\u2019s the only time of the day they have to plan. It\u2019s not free.\n\nAgain, I can only run on my assumption here based on my experience, but going over the teachers head straight to their boss is an asshole move. This will make teachers despise having your kid in their classes .THIS DOESNT MEAN never go to the principal BUT generally you deal with the teacher first.\n\nAdvocating for you child is great, but admin and teachers might not get along, so calling admin on a teacher on a non-issue, that\u2019s a recipe for leaving a sour taste in your kids teachers mouth, and school communities are small, teachers talk, problem parents and their kids are known, biases are created.", "Also If you feel comfortable sharing, I would very much like to know the details of the earlier incident where something the teacher said made kids afraid to come to school the next day.", "I've stopped editing (what I did professionally last) because of my hands. If I can feel them it's just pain. Honestly it's better when they're numb.", "Two. Two teachers. She is special needs so yes I absolutely step in when there is an issue. Too often in public schools a special needs child is mistreated and the biggest mistreatment is by teachers! \nI will never teach my child that respecting a person in a position of authority is more important than her peace and safety.", "The last time I tried to deal with the teacher on her own instead of bringing in a third party my child came home in tears because the teacher was retaliating against her for having called me about the teachers behavior. I haven't had this problem the last 2 years with her other teachers but it's her first year in middle school and she has a new schedule and teachers she's not familiar with so it's hard on her.", "Its an inappropriate lesson and it is based on the false idea that the class collectively did something wrong.", "I agree with this, and I'm sorry, but why is the fact that the sub is an adult not enough to point out that they do have power. Sorry, but if the sub can't handle the heat, then they have no business being there. Find a new career path cause this isn't it. I know there's good days and bad days, but your job is to watch children and direct a classroom. If they're working to become a teacher, they will need to know how to handle this. I wholly agree with op that it is no students job to regulate the emotions or behaviors of her classmates.", "I taught special needs. The biggest mistreatment is not teachers, that\u2019s ludicrous. \n\nYou\u2019re missing my point. I\u2019m not talking about your kids reaction to come to you, that\u2019s great. Good on the kid. My response to you being an asshole is your going straight to admin instead of the teacher, you didn\u2019t even ask the teacher for the full story. \n\nThe moment you went over the teachers head, you did an asshole move.", "The teacher was retaliating? You confirmed this with the teacher? Or is this perceived through your child and you? \n \nI\u2019m not there, but I find it hard to believe this teacher is evil and hates kids with special needs. Is it possible that the information you\u2019re receiving through your child might be not accurate?", "And if this was the first time I've had a problem with the teacher I might agree; but she has consistently been a problem and then targeted my child when I brought it to her.", "I don't think she's evil or hates kids with special needs. I'm aware that my child my have a distorted view of the situation or a bias or just not understand what's going on around her. This is why she is aware that if something is happening she is to record what she can. I also have students in her class tell me their side as well as teachers aides telling me what they think is going on and what they observed.", "In order to handle the situation I need more than her side, I need the facts from everyone, including the teacher. But, once a source has proven they are not trustworthy I will not continue to ask for their side. I've stopped asking for her side because she is not a trustworthy source:", "This framing is odd to me. You clearly have a problem with this teacher,  and she with you and your child. \n\nI don\u2019t know the teachers side of the story. So, remove your child from the class.", "Fair enough.\n\nBased on that, I\u2019ll say NTA", "That\u2019s not a healthy viewpoint, especially with your kids teacher. You now created an environment where it\u2019s parent vs teacher, when it should be parent and teacher. You either need to mend that relationship and come to common ground or remove your daughter from that class.", "When OP said it was \"bad enough,\" she meant that the behavior was sufficiently bad to merit the substitute's taking of names and getting the kids out of the classroom. OP was not criticizing the substitute's action as an overreach.", "Tried, along with 5 other parents. The my refuse to 'shuffle the students around' and our only other option is homeschooling. I'm not in a position to do this, I have small children at home and my husband doesn't have the patience to do it.", "I've tried to remove her from the class. Me and 5 other parents after the last incident. All of us were refused. \nYou can't mend a relationship with a narcissist, and she is textbook.", "Exactly! I'm certain the substitute teacher would not have welcomed the other kids' butting in and undermining her authority. The sub had the authority, and she exercised it appropriately and handled the situation. Regular teacher is exercising authority inappropriately."]}
