According to my daughter, there were some kids in the class who were especially difficult towards the sub.  It was bad enough that the sub took down all their names and sent most of them to the principal's office. When the regular teacher, Mrs. P, came back the next day she saw the report with the names the sub took down and told the entire class to write an apology letter to the sub to be collected the next day. \nThe kids that were mean to the sub needed to write about their poor behavior, the kids who didn't do anything were told to write an apology for not stepping in and standing up to the 'bullies' on behalf of the teacher. \nMy daughter showed me her letter and it basically read 'I'm not sure why I'm writing this, I'm not sorry about anything because I didn't do anything wrong and it's not my responsibility to defend the teacher against students because she has all the power'. I told her to hand it in and made an appointment with the principal and teacher. \nAt the meeting, I explained what happened to the principal and my child's response. I said that I expected that she not get into trouble for it or have issues come from it because I believe she is correct. Mrs. P asked why I thought this was acceptable, I explained that it's not a child's responsibility to stop other kids in class from acting up since not only does it make my child a target for those kids once the sub leaves but it's not her job to manage and regulate the emotions of her classmates, particularly since it's against someone who is in a position of authority. By staying out of it, she  didn't escalate the situation by involving herself in something she wasn't a part of and possibly making it worse. My child has a responsibility to tell a teacher about bullying, but when it's the teacher being bullied what do they expect her to do? I felt like it was also worth mentioning that all the children acting up were boys, so they were expecting the girls to do the emotional labor for the boys by what? Chastising them for misbehaving in class? And then apologizing, like not doing that emotional labor was wrong. \nThe principal agreed with me and told me not to worry about it but the teacher has been difficult ever since. \nI was sure that I was right but a few friends think I'm wrong for taking it to the principal and more than one has said I didn't have to imply that it was a sexism issue. The biggest thing that has me doubting myself is that I was discussing with a friend that my child stands up to bullies when it comes to other kids being bullied, it's who she's always been and I'm proud of that. My friend called me a hypocrite for encouraging her to stand up to bullies for other kids but not for a teacher.

As a parent myself, I would like to think I would have done the same.

It shouldn\u2019t be their responsibility to put themselves in harms way for the sake of anyone else.  It\u2019s not their job. It\u2019s the teachers and administration. If things weren\u2019t being handled appropriately on behalf of the sub, then the teacher needs to bring her concerns to admin for resolution. The unruly kids are old enough to know that being respectful is the bare minimum that should have been done.

And the letter from the 12 year old, MAGNIFICENT!!", "First: NTA. It\u2019s not up to your child to defend a teacher. But, and I probably will be downvoted for this, I do think you and your child would have made a stronger point if you had presented it in a kinder way and show some sympathy for the substitute. To me, and this may be cultural, the letter of your child comes across as an attack at a substitute teacher that was already bullied and looking for a fight. I would teach my child to start with showing a little empathy before making my point: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you\u2026 \u201c In my experience, again this may be regional, your point would have been taken much better that way.", "NTA\n\nYou are spot on with your assessment and I would have done exactly the same thing.  \n\nThe teacher is salty because the principal now knows what she did.  If you didn't make that appointment, the principal would be none the wiser.\n\nThe substitute needs some support.  They are struggling.

Being a sub is tough but it's not other students' responsibility to stand up for a teacher.\n\nBut if a teacher is now being difficult, consider switching to anither class. Some grownups think it's okay to be vindictive towards kids.", "NTA at at all. You're your child's advocate. Every word you said is valid. The principle agreed. If the teacher persists in treating your daughter poorly, then you may need to go back to the principle and ask that your daughter switch classes. He probably won't do anything about the teacher. They rarely do. So, good job, Momma Bear!", "This actually makes me feel a lot better so thank you. My daughter is autistic so it's hard to teach her how to navigate social situations on a normal day, much less ones where the teacher is so against her. The friend that said I'm teaching her it's ok to stand up for some and not others is another parent of a child in the spectrum and I look to her for advice a lot so I was really worried I was teaching her the wrong thing here.", "Did you seriously just compare a bunch of rowdy preteen boys to nazis and my child to a passive sympathizer?", "I\u2019m finally being tested for neurodivergence now as I\u2019m approaching 40.  But the complete honesty and ingenuousness of your daughter\u2019s essay reminded me so much of my own early years where I would be told I did something wrong \u2014 and the something wrong that I did was point out how batshit crazy the \u201cnormal\u201d behavior was.\n\nYour daughter is right.  The substitute teacher did not have control of the class, and apparently did not take action with administration to exercise their authority to discipline and take control of the class.\n\nAs a result, the students who wanted to learn lost instructional time.\n\nThe substitute left specific notes of misbehaving students so the teacher could deal with it on her return.  The teacher decided that it was an \u201ceverybody problem\u201d and her solution was to punish everybody.\n\nExcept, there\u2019s no way to know that if your daughter or other students in the class started trying to stop the misbehaving students, that it wouldn\u2019t have devolved into the kids raising their voices at each other.  I\u2019ve seen it happen when a teacher is using \u201cwait time\u201d to quiet a class.  2-3 kids keep goofing off, and a quiet kid who wants to learn says \u201cstop.  She\u2019s waiting.\u201d  Which then cause the goof offs to escalate and bring more people in, and then some of the other quiet kids get annoyed and start saying \u201cwhy do you always have to be like this?  You know what Mrs. P expects!\u201d And the whole thing devolves with the kids who are trying to quiet the goofballs getting in the same trouble as the goofballs, because \u201cthey aren\u2019t the teacher and should have left to to the adult to deal with.\u201d\n\nAt which point, the neurodivergent child says, \u201cI tried that, but the adult didn\u2019t do anything and I wanted to learn/go to recess/go to music.\u201d  And then gets in trouble for being disrespectful.\n\nBasically, a terrible sub is the worst possible situation for a neurodivergent child \u2014 because it\u2019s a situation in which the social order they are learning and depend on has completely broken down.  If they try to \u201chelp,\u201d they\u2019re disrespecting the adult\u2019s authority and being a buttinsky know-it-all, and get targeted by their classmates.  If they stay out of it, they\u2019re a bystander and as guilty as those who are actively disrupting and get disciplined by the adults.  While this is true of neurotypical students as well, the injustice of it typically strikes ND folks much more deeply because they are trying to learn social rules and they\u2019ve been put into an unwinnable situation where none of the normal rules apply. \n\nYour daughter spoke truth to power because she\u2019s been taught that truth is a good thing.  Power often doesn\u2019t like Truth being pushed in its face, and uses every excuse in the book to discount Truth.\n\nThank you for backing her up.", "These comparisons are getting more and more casual, istg.

The lesson of that story is how they taught my generation to stand up for others. In this instance, the teacher used an actual lived experience of the kids, and people are still up in arms about it. It's the same lesson, just a different approach.", "Except it isn't a good comparison at all.  It was never those kids' job to stand up for the teacher.

This was a *Letter of APOLOGY to the sub teacher* that would be *given* to the sub teacher to make her feel better.**\n\nThe good kids (remember the OP's daughter is a pre-teen) shouldn't be apologizing to the sub teacher because it is not their responsibility to stand up to the bullies or to try to modify the bullies behavior towards an **adult** who was **in charge of the classroom**", "And the child correctly explained that it isn't her responsibility to defend a teacher. The teacher has the power, and she allowed the teacher to exercise that power. If anything, stepping in could have undermined the teachers authority and caused even more bullying.\n\nIt sounds like this kid steps in and tries to stop bullying when it happens to other students when there isn't a teacher around to do it. I don't see what the problem is.\n\nIt wasn't just a \"teachable moment\". The teacher was asking for the student to write an apology. An apology inherently implies that a person did something wrong which requires the apology. OPs kid wrote a letter saying that they wouldn't apologize because they didn't do anything wrong.\n\nI can empathize with the situation. It was our last home game and our marching band wore white socks instead of black for fun as a gag. One of the parent helpers took it personally and got so upset that she accidentally slammed her own hand in a door and had to go to the hospital. She demanded an apology or she would stop volunteering and we were all told that we needed to sign a sheet with all our names on it, I refused.\n\nIt never could be explained to me how it was the responsibility of teenagers to control the emotional regulation of an adult, and how wearing white socks was designed to attack her personally, despite the band teacher and the other dozen parent volunteers getting a kick out of it before the one parent ran off throwing a fit and injuring herself.\n\nIt isn't the responsibility of the students to protect the teachers.

I don\u2019t think I would have assigned it quite the same way (I can\u2019t imagine myself telling the kids to think about how to stand up to their peers bullying an adult), but I can see myself having the whole class write a letter because frankly if I wasn\u2019t there I don\u2019t accurately know who was involved.

There is no respect for teachers anymore.\n\nNow off my soapbox. Writing a letter isn't going to help with respect. Most of the class was there to learn. It was just a pack of entitled hooligans that felt it necessary to harass the substitute. As soon as it started, that substitute should have sent the first hooligan to the office in order to try to take back control of the class. It's not on the classmates to control chaos. It's hard enough for them to control their own impulses \n\nNTA", "Lightly YTA. This was an excellent opportunity to practice BS writing that comes in super handy later on and does nothing to harm your daughter. Having her write something about how sorry she was that the class was mean and made the teachers day more difficult, would go further towards goodwill from the teacher then refusing to do anything.", "NTA. Teachers shouldn\u2019t need students to defend them against students.", "NTA. There\u2019s a John Mulaney sketch that reminds me of this post. I don\u2019t know how to link things so Google \u201cJohn Mulaney Bench\u201d but I feel like his dad and the teacher had similar responses.", "NTA.", "I'm sorry I think you missed the whole point of the lesson! It's not about just your child. It's not about stopping bullies, It's about \"if you see something, say something\". You are teaching your child to look the other way to harm at 12. With this lesson you just taught, you want her to look the the other way to harm just because uts an adult. That's not okay either. A person is a person no matter the age or maturity. You really need to see the big picture not just a single incident. It's parents that choose these small battles that cause problems and waves in a classroom. I work at a middle school and I can tell you that honestly when parents do this we will nod and agree and roll our eyes when you leave. You and you child missed the point. It's really not worth fighting about but you had to escalate the issue, it's a letter. \n\nYTA", "NTA. You are doing great parenting. I had a similar experience when i was in high school and my father also defended me but of my classmates parents believed the teacher and they had do endure a punishment for something only 2 people did.", "Nta. Good for your daughter for standing up for herself", "NTA\nYour daughter's letter was spot on. The principal agreed with you and her. Now you need to talk to the principal about the repercussions your daughter is receiving from same teacher. \n\nYour friend is comparing apples to oranges. If the sub lost control of the class she should have brought in the principal right then and there. It wasn't your daughter's place to try to control the class. Any efforts on her part would have been unproductive and may have escalated the situation. Good luck.", "NTA", "NTA. You handled it perfectly.", "This teacher's request is ridiculous. Students can't bully teachers because there is a power dynamic there. The sub failed to keep the students in line. It definitely isn't any students responsibility to control her class mates. NTA", "NTA - that substitute is stupid, the teacher is stupid, your friends thinking youre wrong are stupid", "NTA. I would bet money that if she had said something to the bullies, she would have gotten in trouble for \u201ccausing a scene\u201d and making things worse.", "It was sexist.  So you are supposed to call out bad behaviour but not sexism?  It\u2019s ridiculous to expect children to stand up for the teacher and then apologize for now having done so.  Utter shit.  NTA", "Retired teacher here, who sometimes subs. Soft YTA. Your daughter is amazing for standing up to bullies (good job Mom!). However, I know how kids treat substitute teachers. Why didn\u2019t you contact the teacher directly with your concerns? Most teachers do not use our sick days unless desperately needed. You may have very well added to the instructor\u2019s stress by going directly to the principal. \nAs to the student behavior with the substitute: the teacher probably made the whole class apologize in order to make a point to the entire class that they are part of a community; and need to behave in a responsible manner. The teacher will  probably talk to the good kids privately to determine who the ring leaders were; and then deal with them. \nMaybe the substitute did not leave detailed notes about the bratty kids. (Kids switch seats; and give fake names.) Peer pressure is a powerful thing. If your daughter, and her like minded friends, are fed up with the foolish behavior; they\u2019ll start calling it out.\nFinally, 12 year olds are notorious for mob mentality. While I\u2019m sure your daughter is indeed wonderful; please be mindful of the \u201cnot my little angel\u201d mind set.", "It always seem like schools don't like punishing bullies for some reason, gotta make it a class punishment to soften the blow.", "Eh, it depends. I'll preface the following by saying that OP is absolutely correct to advocate for her daughter's response in all the ways that she does, especially given her kid's age and the fact that we're talking about a sub.\n\nThat said, I'm a teacher, and I know it's a lot more effective for students in the class to tell the rowdy students to just shut up already than for me to constantly correct and redirect. There's only so much \"power\" a teacher has (even as the main teacher), and some students take full advantage of those limitations.\n\nRowdy kids are usually doing it to show off to the audience of their peers, so when those peers show their annoyance or lack of admiration, the rowdy ones will usually bluster but simmer down into a sulk without further escalation.\n\nIt seems to happen organically, though; once a student becomes disruptive/annoying enough, it's usually several students who will simultaneously call him/her on it together, so there's not one \"goody two shoes\" preaching to *be nice to Teacher.*\n\nIt's not something a teacher should encourage or expect, and usually not something you should even need. It's an outcome of having a good overall relationship with the class, being an overall effective teacher, and the rowdy ones being generally insufferable.", "Exactly", "NTA at all.  I was bullied a lot as a kid.  I was a big kid and told NEVER to fight back by my dad (wrong advice).  All the guys who wanted to look tough attacked me.  Made my life hell until I learned to stand up for myself.  I remember the first time I stood up for myself.  The bully tried to hit me.  I put my hand on his head and held him back while he kept trying to hit me until the teacher came in.  He got in trouble, I went back to class.  I can tell you, all you get when you stand up to a bully is a pissed off bully.  If I hadn't been so big I would of had my butt kicked.  Not a kid's job to stop bullies.  If teachers can't take care of this situation they shouldn't be teachers.", "It's a way of punishing students who didn't do anything wrong for the students who did.", "Now her actual teacher might be bullying the child. So apparently stand up for the teacher, or become a target by your teacher.", "I disagree with your first statement. Of course she has the ability to give them consequences but saying a teacher is wrong in their profession because they've been bullied by students is not right. She cannot demand respect and get it the second she does so. Getting kids respect isn't easy. Don't blame her for being bullied. Demanding an apology from students who didn't do anything wrong is wild tho. I agreed with you on that.", ">Assigning this to everyone as a consequence was really the only thing she could do. Saying \u201ceveryone except X Y and Z has to do this\u201d would be giving a chance for culprits to get away without consequence\n\nThey already had the culprit. The teacher could've also ignored it since it had already been dealt with by the sub by sending those responsible to the principal's office. \n\n> so offended at a class consequence since I am not clairvoyant and can\u2019t tell with 100% accuracy who participated in the bad behaviour. \n\nCollective punishment is ineffective and is also a war crime. If you don't know who to punish them you don't punish anyone. \n\n>I also think your insinuations about sexism aren\u2019t fair or likely accurate - it may have been boys sent to the office, but it doesn\u2019t mean it was only the boys being assholes to the sub.\n\nThat doesn't even make sense. Why would the sub only send the boys and leave the girls alone? It's illogical to think the sub did not accurately name and punish the students involved.\n\n>You went straight to 3 and escalated a situation before it needed to.\n\nOnly based on your arbitrary preference on the way things should be handled. How did it get escalated? Going to the principal is only an escalation if the teacher is wrong.", "They would only have \"undermined the teacher's authority\" if they had done in front of the class or brought their kid along. Having a private meeting with the teacher and principal does not undermine anything.", "So OP has to potentially waste their own time going to multiple people rather than stamping out the issue at once?", "I would imagine it has something to do with little bullies coming from big bullies. While it is their responsibility, I can see being hesitant to provoke the wrath of the MaH pErFeCt AnGeL parents.", "Good point.", "If it helps, I've subbed for many a rowdy and disruptive class, and I'd never expect a student (neurodivergent or neurotypical) to \"stick up\" for me or another adult.  Teacher is being super inappropriate, and honestly, so is your friend.  Your daughter is in class to learn, not protect the feelings of adults.  She is not a hall monitor, she is not a TA, and she is not an adult.\n\nAs a personal side note, I'm not neurodivergent, but I was a teacher's pet, and I was expected to monitor and correct the behavior of my classmates by my teachers.  It messed up my social life to catastrophic degrees, to the point where I didn't really have friends until college, and I have social anxiety through the roof.  It's not a great spot to be in.  You did amazing protecting your daughter, props to you!", "I knew your daughters letter sounded like something I would have written haha. Thank you for standing up for her right to be a child, I was always expected to manage the behavior of male classmates and act as a buffer on the seating chart", "so, when one of my kids was in kindergarten, they had a sub. And the class did a thing called Star of the Day, to celebrate one student. Usually birthdays, but also for those that had summer birthdays, etc, so everyone got a shot. Well the sub came in and said, \"well, today's star of the day is Me!\" \n\nNow, this had never happened. And Stella (5F at the time) heard that, she immediately stood up and said \"No fair! boooo!\" and other kids joined in, so you could say she started a bit of a ruckus. The sub hauled her to the office and they called me.\n\nAfter I heard what happened, I looked at her, I looked at the teacher, and I said, \"and this is a problem how?\"  To this day, Stella puts up with no unfairness from anyone.", "I had a similar answer from an autistic child after the class did something not-so-nice to me and it wasn't clear who did this. I knew that this kid was innocent and found his non-apology totally acceptable!", "If your friend's child were in the same situation she might feel differently. Your daughter making an empty apology will solve nothing.", "I made a response to someone else, but essentially it boils down to -- I'm a teacher and the people you're working with are absolutely in the wrong. There *is* value to students regulating other students, but it should happen organically and because the rowdy students are annoying to the \"good\" ones, not out of duty to protect the teacher.\n\nPersonally, I think one of the challenges of teaching neurodivergent people \"the rules\" is that a lot of the rules are nonsense, meant to encourage conformity and unquestioning adherence to an arbitrarily established status quo.", "I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re advocating for your daughter!

You are definitely NTA.", "So what you\u2019re saying is, if you can\u2019t deal with kids and keeping them in line, as a teacher, you should make the good 12 year olds control the bad 12 year olds?

I'm completely on your side here.", "It absolutely does. \n\nDeal with classroom situations with the teacher. Bringing in admin should be done for extreme circumstances. This was not extreme, the teacher did something dumb, deal with the teacher.", "And we wonder why there\u2019s a teacher shortage/burnout. Parents of kids going straight to teacher bosses to get them in trouble for non-issue. \n\nThe teacher was away, and instead of being able to enjoy the day off or deal with whatever they needed to do, they have to come back to a class that was shit to a supply. Plus, I very much doubt OP\u2019s daughter was \u201cinnocent\u201d, so now cuz the class was shit, they have  to deal with a parent complaining to admin, which means admin now has to a record of complaint on teachers record, which doesn\u2019t look good come appraisal time. \n\nOr a quick email or phone call to teacher to explain concerns. \n\nOP didn\u2019t even discuss or try to discuss with teacher, went straight to the bosses on a non-issue, that\u2019s an asshole move.", "Nice one-liner dude, but read the whole thread.", ">Except, there\u2019s no way to know that if your daughter or other students in the class started trying to stop the misbehaving students, that it wouldn\u2019t have devolved into the kids raising their voices at each other.  I\u2019ve seen it happen when a teacher is using \u201cwait time\u201d to quiet a class.  2-3 kids keep goofing off, and a quiet kid who wants to learn says \u201cstop.  She\u2019s waiting.\u201d  Which then cause the goof offs to escalate and bring more people in, and then some of the other quiet kids get annoyed and start saying \u201cwhy do you always have to be like this?  You know what Mrs. P expects!\u201d And the whole thing devolves with the kids who are trying to quiet the goofballs getting in the same trouble as the goofballs, because \u201cthey aren\u2019t the teacher and should have left to to the adult to deal with.\u201d\n\nYes this can absolutely happen. And not just in classrooms.\n\nI used to work at a large corporation. The IT department would create huge distribution lists with all the people who had access to a specific software and then use that to send out notifications of software maintenance, etc. You would think IT employees would be smart enough to put the distribution list as a bcc in the email. But no - at least half the time it was on the \"TO\" line and inevitably someone would \"Reply All\"  to request being removed from the distribution list and everyone would get ***that*** message. Someone else would follow suit again replying all and it would all go down hill from there. Including idiots who replied to ALL telling people NOT to reply to ALL. \n\nOn more than one occasion the email server blew up!", ">It absolutely does. \n\nExcept it doesn't and I explained how it doesn't.

I know plenty of 4th and 5th graders both taller and bigger than me. \n\nEspecially, if it was a new and inexperienced sub. Also depends on how much support admin offers to their subs.\n\n\"Power\" means nothing if the children don't care or have any respect for the sub.", "As far as I can tell, the sub *did* handle it just fine, and took down the names of the troublemakers for the regular teacher to deal with.
