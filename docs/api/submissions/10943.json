According to my daughter, there were some kids in the class who were especially difficult towards the sub.  It was bad enough that the sub took down all their names and sent most of them to the principal's office. When the regular teacher, Mrs. P, came back the next day she saw the report with the names the sub took down and told the entire class to write an apology letter to the sub to be collected the next day. \nThe kids that were mean to the sub needed to write about their poor behavior, the kids who didn't do anything were told to write an apology for not stepping in and standing up to the 'bullies' on behalf of the teacher. \nMy daughter showed me her letter and it basically read 'I'm not sure why I'm writing this, I'm not sorry about anything because I didn't do anything wrong and it's not my responsibility to defend the teacher against students because she has all the power'. I told her to hand it in and made an appointment with the principal and teacher. \nAt the meeting, I explained what happened to the principal and my child's response. I said that I expected that she not get into trouble for it or have issues come from it because I believe she is correct. Mrs. P asked why I thought this was acceptable, I explained that it's not a child's responsibility to stop other kids in class from acting up since not only does it make my child a target for those kids once the sub leaves but it's not her job to manage and regulate the emotions of her classmates, particularly since it's against someone who is in a position of authority. By staying out of it, she  didn't escalate the situation by involving herself in something she wasn't a part of and possibly making it worse. My child has a responsibility to tell a teacher about bullying, but when it's the teacher being bullied what do they expect her to do? I felt like it was also worth mentioning that all the children acting up were boys, so they were expecting the girls to do the emotional labor for the boys by what? Chastising them for misbehaving in class? And then apologizing, like not doing that emotional labor was wrong. \nThe principal agreed with me and told me not to worry about it but the teacher has been difficult ever since. \nI was sure that I was right but a few friends think I'm wrong for taking it to the principal and more than one has said I didn't have to imply that it was a sexism issue. The biggest thing that has me doubting myself is that I was discussing with a friend that my child stands up to bullies when it comes to other kids being bullied, it's who she's always been and I'm proud of that. My friend called me a hypocrite for encouraging her to stand up to bullies for other kids but not for a teacher.

She is correct in her understanding that a teacher holds power. It\u2019s not appropriate to compare the two.

By taking it to the principal, and bringing up the sex dynamic of the situation, which imo was a valid component of the event, you exposed the teacher\u2019s internal bias which I\u2019m sure embarrassed her more than anything which explains her becoming difficult.

As a parent myself, I would like to think I would have done the same.  Her asking the whole class to write an apology or something nice to the sub: ok, it\u2019s in good faith I guess to lift the sub\u2019s spirits. Asking the unnamed kids to apologize: what? AND on the grounds that they stood by and didn\u2019t do anything: No way.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with escalating this to the principle.  This is wasn\u2019t a one on one issue between the teacher and your daughter. This affected a good portion of the class.  \n\nKids are in school to learn.  It shouldn\u2019t be their responsibility to put themselves in harms way for the sake of anyone else.  It\u2019s not their job. It\u2019s the teachers and administration. If things weren\u2019t being handled appropriately on behalf of the sub, then the teacher needs to bring her concerns to admin for resolution. The unruly kids are old enough to know that being respectful is the bare minimum that should have been done.

Yes the teacher is being weird towards you now because she knows you won't take any BS. And yes it was a sexist issue but we are so used to \"boys will be boys and girls will apologize for it\" that it isn't noticed in this age group. Well done, what a great job you are doing. And the letter from the 12 year old, MAGNIFICENT!!", "First: NTA. It\u2019s not up to your child to defend a teacher. But, and I probably will be downvoted for this, I do think you and your child would have made a stronger point if you had presented it in a kinder way and show some sympathy for the substitute. To me, and this may be cultural, the letter of your child comes across as an attack at a substitute teacher that was already bullied and looking for a fight. I would teach my child to start with showing a little empathy before making my point: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you\u2026 \u201c In my experience, again this may be regional, your point would have been taken much better that way.", "NTA\n\nYou are spot on with your assessment and I would have done exactly the same thing.  \n\nThe teacher is salty because the principal now knows what she did.  If you didn't make that appointment, the principal would be none the wiser.\n\nThe substitute needs some support.  They are struggling.  But it's not up to the well behaved kids in the class to police the other kids who are doing the wrong thing.", "NTA, as a teacher! Being a sub is tough but it's not other students' responsibility to stand up for a teacher.\n\nBut if a teacher is now being difficult, consider switching to anither class. Some grownups think it's okay to be vindictive towards kids.", "NTA at at all. You're your child's advocate. Every word you said is valid. The principle agreed. If the teacher persists in treating your daughter poorly, then you may need to go back to the principle and ask that your daughter switch classes. He probably won't do anything about the teacher. They rarely do. So, good job, Momma Bear!", "This actually makes me feel a lot better so thank you. My daughter is autistic so it's hard to teach her how to navigate social situations on a normal day, much less ones where the teacher is so against her. The friend that said I'm teaching her it's ok to stand up for some and not others is another parent of a child in the spectrum and I look to her for advice a lot so I was really worried I was teaching her the wrong thing here.", "Did you seriously just compare a bunch of rowdy preteen boys to nazis and my child to a passive sympathizer?", "I\u2019m finally being tested for neurodivergence now as I\u2019m approaching 40.  But the complete honesty and ingenuousness of your daughter\u2019s essay reminded me so much of my own early years where I would be told I did something wrong \u2014 and the something wrong that I did was point out how batshit crazy the \u201cnormal\u201d behavior was.\n\nYour daughter is right.  The substitute teacher did not have control of the class, and apparently did not take action with administration to exercise their authority to discipline and take control of the class.\n\nAs a result, the students who wanted to learn lost instructional time.\n\nThe substitute left specific notes of misbehaving students so the teacher could deal with it on her return.  The teacher decided that it was an \u201ceverybody problem\u201d and her solution was to punish everybody.\n\nExcept, there\u2019s no way to know that if your daughter or other students in the class started trying to stop the misbehaving students, that it wouldn\u2019t have devolved into the kids raising their voices at each other.  I\u2019ve seen it happen when a teacher is using \u201cwait time\u201d to quiet a class.  2-3 kids keep goofing off, and a quiet kid who wants to learn says \u201cstop.  She\u2019s waiting.\u201d  Which then cause the goof offs to escalate and bring more people in, and then some of the other quiet kids get annoyed and start saying \u201cwhy do you always have to be like this?  You know what Mrs. P expects!\u201d And the whole thing devolves with the kids who are trying to quiet the goofballs getting in the same trouble as the goofballs, because \u201cthey aren\u2019t the teacher and should have left to to the adult to deal with.\u201d\n\nAt which point, the neurodivergent child says, \u201cI tried that, but the adult didn\u2019t do anything and I wanted to learn/go to recess/go to music.\u201d  And then gets in trouble for being disrespectful.\n\nBasically, a terrible sub is the worst possible situation for a neurodivergent child \u2014 because it\u2019s a situation in which the social order they are learning and depend on has completely broken down.  If they try to \u201chelp,\u201d they\u2019re disrespecting the adult\u2019s authority and being a buttinsky know-it-all, and get targeted by their classmates.  If they stay out of it, they\u2019re a bystander and as guilty as those who are actively disrupting and get disciplined by the adults.  While this is true of neurotypical students as well, the injustice of it typically strikes ND folks much more deeply because they are trying to learn social rules and they\u2019ve been put into an unwinnable situation where none of the normal rules apply. \n\nYour daughter spoke truth to power because she\u2019s been taught that truth is a good thing.  Power often doesn\u2019t like Truth being pushed in its face, and uses every excuse in the book to discount Truth.\n\nThank you for backing her up.", "These comparisons are getting more and more casual, istg.

But thats how they taught that particular lesson when I was in school (so its what came to mind), I thought using a situation closer to home was probably better.", "Yeah I did not compare her or her kid to Hitler. The lesson of that story is how they taught my generation to stand up for others. In this instance, the teacher used an actual lived experience of the kids, and people are still up in arms about it. It's the same lesson, just a different approach.", "Except it isn't a good comparison at all.  It was never those kids' job to stand up for the teacher.  The teacher had all the power there, and resources for if they could not maintain control of the classroom.", "Really? I was taught to stand up for anyone who is being bullied.

The teacher was using a situation that all kids experience to teach them a lesson about standing up for others by asking them to evaluate what happened and why they did or did not do something. Is that really a punishment?\n\n How is this wrong?", ">The teacher was using a situation that all kids experience to teach them a lesson about standing up for others by asking them to evaluate what happened and why they did or did not do something\n\nNo that's not what the OP wrote, this is what the teacher asked the kids who weren't not bullying the sub teacher to do.\n\n> he kids who didn't do anything were told to write an apology for not stepping in and standing up to the 'bullies' on behalf of the teacher.\n\nThe teacher asked the good kids to write an apology for not standing up to the 'bullies' on behalf of the teacher. \n\n**This was not an assignment on what they could or could not have done better in the face of someone bullying someone else.  This was a *Letter of APOLOGY to the sub teacher* that would be *given* to the sub teacher to make her feel better.**\n\nThe good kids (remember the OP's daughter is a pre-teen) shouldn't be apologizing to the sub teacher because it is not their responsibility to stand up to the bullies or to try to modify the bullies behavior towards an **adult** who was **in charge of the classroom**", "And the child correctly explained that it isn't her responsibility to defend a teacher. The teacher has the power, and she allowed the teacher to exercise that power. If anything, stepping in could have undermined the teachers authority and caused even more bullying.\n\nIt sounds like this kid steps in and tries to stop bullying when it happens to other students when there isn't a teacher around to do it. I don't see what the problem is.\n\nIt wasn't just a \"teachable moment\". The teacher was asking for the student to write an apology. An apology inherently implies that a person did something wrong which requires the apology. OPs kid wrote a letter saying that they wouldn't apologize because they didn't do anything wrong.\n\nI can empathize with the situation. It was our last home game and our marching band wore white socks instead of black for fun as a gag. One of the parent helpers took it personally and got so upset that she accidentally slammed her own hand in a door and had to go to the hospital. She demanded an apology or she would stop volunteering and we were all told that we needed to sign a sheet with all our names on it, I refused.\n\nIt never could be explained to me how it was the responsibility of teenagers to control the emotional regulation of an adult, and how wearing white socks was designed to attack her personally, despite the band teacher and the other dozen parent volunteers getting a kick out of it before the one parent ran off throwing a fit and injuring herself.\n\nIt isn't the responsibility of the students to protect the teachers. The responsibility goes the other way around.", "I'm sorry I missed the part where she said these letters were being given to anyone.

Private school here will be 10k a year, and unless there's some major financial changes it's not happening.", "The issue with apology letter can be a good ground to push for a switch, implying there's bulling from the teacher and some sort of vengeance.
