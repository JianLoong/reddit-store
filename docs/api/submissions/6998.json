Hal has a friend Ned (65M) who moved out of state. Ned visits us for nearly every holiday, usually for 2 weeks. He calls and *tells us* that he's coming and assumes he's always welcome.\n\nNed expects people to *really cater* to their guests AND to *always* respect elders. He is also *extremely picky and critical* *of everything*. He expects to be waited on while he sips drinks. He wants nothing but steak, lobster, or lamb for dinner, and refuses to eat leftovers. Ned always makes comments to me like, \"When I come here, I expect it to be like a 5-star resort.\" (actual quote)\n\nHal humors Ned, even though he's not really like this himself. When Ned visits, though, Hal caters to him, and wants me to do the same. They want me to cook and do mounds of dishes, as well as clean up the house constantly after him. Mind you, we're not on vacation, but we both WFH.\n\nThis past holiday, Ned immediately irritated me. There was a severe winter storm when he arrived, and he made Hal drive to 3 stores on the way home from the airport just to get a specific salad dressing he wanted. But then Ned didn't like the one they bought, so he never used it. Strike 1.\n\nThe next day, Ned and Hal went out to run some errands, one of which was Hal's eye exam appointment. He ended up needing to have his eyes dilated for the exam. Ned refused to drive afterwards, but still insisted that Hal take him to multiple stores to buy the food he wanted us to cook for him. Strike 2.\n\nFor a few days, I cooked for Ned. One day, I made lobster ravioli for lunch. It had shredded lobster and cheese inside the ravioli, and I made a tomato cream sauce with bigger chunks of lobster tail in it. I put the ravioli in bowls and spooned the sauce on top. Naturally, some of the sauce went to the bottom while the lobster chunks stayed on top. I purposely gave Ned more than us.\n\nI saw Ned look to see how much we had in our bowls, then dig around in his bowl with a fork, and he said, \"So you just put a few pieces of lobster on top to make it *look like* a lot?\" Strike 3. That was the last thing I cooked for his entire visit. I ignored both of them and just said, \"That's nice,\" or \"I'll make something for myself,\" whenever they told me what they were cooking/doing.\n\nOn Ned's last night here, he really wanted me to make him filet mignon with a mushroom sauce, but I refused, so they made it themselves. He even went so far as to ask me if I knew how old he was, and I said, \"I don't know, about the same age as Hal.\" He said, \"No, I'm older!\" and I just shrugged. Ned was mad at me when he left because I was \"so rude and disrespectful to him\" during his visit.\n\nAfter Ned left, I told Hal that I don't want him to visit anymore and that he ruins the holidays for me. Hal disagreed and said to just be nice to him because \"he's old and might not be around forever.\"\n\nAITA for being rude to this houseguest and not wanting him to visit anymore?", "created_utc": 1673373469, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108g81u/aita_for_being_rude_to_our_houseguest_and_not/", "score": 377, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your husband insists on having him then I would book a vacation elsewhere while he is there.  Even if just an air bnb you can work from in town and not deal with him.  I would NEVER act like that as a guest in a home and the fact that either of you has ever allowed or catered to that behavior baffles me.  Also, a guest is someone that YOU invite over.  I think you need to have a serious sit down with your husband on why he is allowing someone to be so disrespectful towards the both of you in your own home and go over what future visits will look like.  Mainly, that they won't include you.", "NTA if your husband wants to be Ned\u2019s servant, that\u2019s his business.

If he still insists, book yourself a hotel for his stay and go be by yourself ( if you're able to) . \n\nBut Honestly,  a house guest should be a two yes one no situation.  \n\nYou both live in that house, and you have every right to be comfortable, not critiqued about cooking or having to deal whatever else your entitled guest does or says. \n\nIf your SO thinks it's OK to just railroad you about having him over, then you need to have a very serious talk, because that's unfair and nobody should be made to feel like they can't have a say in the house they pay for and live in. \n\nYou shouldn't be made to feel unwanted,  unwelcome or unappreciated in your own home. \n\nAlso, maybe point out what a shitty friend Ned is, considering he wouldn't drive after Hal's eye appointment,  and asking him to go to 3 stores for salad dressing. \n\nAs far as Ned \"demanding\" he be respected Simply because he's older is a bullshit concept,  always has been,  always will be.\n\n Respect is earned and a 2 way street!\n\n\nI will never understand people that go to someone's house as a guest and suddenly think the house runs around them and their wants and that they should be catered to / waited on! \n\nWhen I'm a guest in someone's house I always try to make sure the hosts aren't doing anything extra for me like:\n\n* don't cook anything elaborate just because I'm here, make whatever you want,  OR, better yet, let ME cook for you so you can relax.  \n\n*don't worry about entertaining me, I'm an adult and can manage myself if you're busy or not interested in doing said things. \n\n*don't even think about having to clean up after me!

You and your SO are way to far into adulthood to be putting up with this. \n\nI can only assume that either Ned has some blackmail on your SO or they're secretly in a relationship.

Do you think women from Ned\u2019s culture think he\u2019s great ? cos he sure sounds single as hell. \n\nYou need to have a deep talk with your husband about how disrespected you have been, and draw a strong boundary.

It sounds like it's been going on for years. Have you said anything to yr SO before about it?\n\nIf he comes next year, leave; stay elsewhere. That'll send the message.", "NTA. It sounds like what you really have is a Hal problem because he's allowing you his partner to be disrespected and treated like a servant.

Make sure it\u2019s clear that Ned is his guest, not yours and you want nothing to do with it.", "NTA - I get Hal wanting to stay friends with Ned, but Hal is taking massive advantage of that friendship, unless there's some kind of condition like concussion or dementia causing him to be so rude to both you and Hal.\n\nI (48f) was brought up to respect my elders, and to treat guests (serve them first, give them the nicest plate etc), but that never meant running around being treated like crap.  The other thing that I was taught was that if I was a guest in someone else's house, then it's their house, their rules, and to treat them with respect (you know, like a decent human being would).  Ned definitely not behaving like a good friend or guest, and you are quite right in taking a stand.", "WOAH! NTA I\u2019d give him budget ramen and remind him that if he wants 5 star hotel service he\u2019s more than welcome to find a 5 star hotel. Age is no excuse to be a dick. He\u2019s the asshole, not you.", "NTA, Ned is an ass.  If Hal wants to cater to him, fine, but you don't need to.  In fact, I would go to a 5 star resort by yourself when he comes to visit. \"Respect your elders\"?  He's literally 15 years older than you, that's not much. Besides, respect is earned, not given just because you've managed to make it to the wrinkled years. It's not like he shows any drop of respect to the people he expects to host him.", "NTA, if Hal wants to give his friend the hotel treatment then let HAL do all the work for it.

I\u2019d say never again.", "Ned is 65, not 85. You could have another 20 years of this if you don't stand up to him.

You can enjoy the break as well and everyone is happy. NTA", "NTA, but your husband and his friend are. I would've told Ned to leave the first night and then told Hal that if he didn't like it, he could go too.", "NTA - Tell Hal if he can't tell the guy no - then you'll be taking vacations when Ned comes - either going to visit other friends/family, a solo beach/mountain trip or even a 'staycation' at a local hotel.  At the VERY LEAST Hal needs to 'shorten' the trip, or discuss with Ned that no matter how old someone is, it is NOT ok to be rude and demanding.", "Is Ned holding something over Hal's head? Does Hal have a secret that Ned's keeping? It strikes me as a little strange that your partner would tolerate so many visits, so many demands and such disrespect toward you! Maybe Ned saved his life?\n\nRegardless, you are NTA.

Ned will outlive both of you because assholes take the longest to die.", "NTA but your husband is right, Ned won't be around forever since he's no longer welcome in your home.

First - you\u2019re NTA.  Second - I can only think of one piece of advice for you, OP, and that is to make Ned never stepping foot in your house again the hill you die on.  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s your house, Hals house, how you split your finances, or what your relationship status is beyond SO-roommates but seriously - you do not have to put up with this!  Ned is a user, a narcissist, and a total AH.  Move out next time he comes or refuse to participate in this little charade he and Hal have going.  What unbelievable BS.  You need to stop this.", "NTA. He outstayed his welcome before he arrived.", "NTA, this dude sucks.

But Ned apparently thinks otherwise, or at least feels the pros outweigh the cons: so your issue is with Ned, and being rude to Hal won't fix that.\n\nYou don't say how long they have been friends, or when you came into the relationship (or home if this was Ned's originally).

There's something else going on here.  There is absolutely no reason to treat a \"friend\" like this.  Hal must think he owes his guy something.  Either way, you don't.  Stand your ground, don't cater to him anymore.   I'm petty, though. I'd probably plan a last minute spa vacation the next time he calls and not tell the husband.", "NTA.

What on Earth did Hal DO?!?", "The easy answer is \u201cno. You get what I have served you and the response you are looking for is thank you\u201d.

He knows he\u2019s onto a good thing with you and he is abusing it to the max. \n\nYou need to leave Hal to his own devices when Ned visits.

That's not old at all", "The point is that she doesn't want him around anymore period.", "This is the only choice now. Plainly the men are using the visiting pretext as a holiday for themselves to be waited on hand and foot. I\u2019d be having none of that. He\u2019s there? Fine, but I\u2019m not. It\u2019ll get old fast when they no longer have a servant on tap.", "Love this! He would leave so fast!

Would he have to provide for you as a guest, or would he be entitled enough to refuse you outright because it is cultural that he shouldn't have to put himself to any effort for his subordinates? Possibly an interesting experiment for the next holiday season...", "Being old doesn't give him jack shit rights. Dann being a guest doesn't give him jack shit rights. If Ned wants a 5 star resort feeling he should stay at a 5 star resort. It's too expensive? Well sucks for Ned but you are no 5 star resort.\n\nNTA and get Hal to read the comments.

You're not their maid, you're not their cook, you're not their personal assistant!   If Hal wants him around, he can do all the cooking and cleaning and catering when Ned visits.

Deference is given to people who are older than you but not to the point where we have to do everything they say. \n\n\nA five year difference is nothing. At best you\u2019d speak with more formality. Also respect and politeness are important in these cultures; you should be a good host but you should also be a good *guest* too. The guest should bring over a present for the host and pay for dinners when they go out. It\u2019s abhorrent to treat the hosts like Ned is doing. \n\n\nI have no idea what the dynamic is between your husband and Ned but it certainly sounds like they\u2019re the odd ones out.

Why are you putting up with this?! \n\nNext time he visits, book a nice hotel for yourself. Your partner can run around after him.", "Then if Hal wants to serve Ned he can do so.

When I tell you that the food he made for us smelled and tasted like a f\\*c&ing wet fart... and he made A LOT of it and then acted like it was the best thing he ever tased! Hal and I still laugh about it. \n\nI can't believe that man is so picky about what we cook for him, because he cannot cook at all. I think he normally eats at restaurants every day, or he just makes sandwiches or cereal at home.", ">Open a bank account and put money aside each paycheck.  Call it your Ned account.", "Stop deliberating on it and just tell him and go.\n\nYour husband has told you he intends to continue to be passive and accommodating for his friend. There is no point pushing the issue so you should just do what makes you happy at this point, especially if this is coming on the back of *years* of trying to and failing to meet this houseguest's insane standards (which I suspect aren't so much about making him feel comfortable as they are about deriving pleasure from seeing people jump when he says so).", "I guarantee in their culture, women are expected to be subservient to men. So even if Hal doesn't do it himself, he doesn't stand up for OP because of the expectations Ned has.", "Ewwwww! Well, then he can go to a restaurant or order takeout.

Yet he sounds like a civil human being (a delightful one actually).  Ned doesn't get to pin this all on culture.", "If you're around Ned again, sing the praises of this friend and point out what a pleasure it is to create 5 star meals/experiences with him because he helps and is appreciated.", "I mean it sounds like you're trying to vague but ultimately what it sounds like you're saying is that Ned views himself as a superior, hell agrees, and they both think that you should be a servant to the both of them.\n\nIt doesn't matter what the root culture is, them viewing you as their servant is inappropriate and you need to fight back cuz you don't deserve it", "Got any enemies that are single?", "You're actually right, and I didn't think of that. I honestly don't even know if his other friend is older than I am or not because he would just never act that way.", "I don't want to turn the post into bashing any particular culture, and Hal does not expect me to serve him when it's just the two of us at home. It's more like he expects both of us to serve Ned when he visits. I think the cultural belief is something along the lines of, \"If someone makes the effort to travel and spends money to visit you, then you should cater to them while they're at your house.\"", "Does the culture allow the \"guests\" to invite themselves?\n\nMy culture says that guests ask if it's okay to visit, then I say yes or no. If it's yes, it comes with boundaries.", "There are lots of people on Reddit of all different cultures. I didn\u2019t ask what culture Ned and your Husband are part of to bash them. I think your Husband and Ned are massively over exaggerating that this is part of their culture and acting like you wouldn\u2019t understand because you\u2019re white. I have Western European, South Asian and Latino ancestry and this isn\u2019t normal in those cultures. It\u2019s a massive thing in cultures to respect your elders and be hospitable, but I think most people here would agree that there isn\u2019t any culture that wouldn\u2019t have a problem with how extreme Ned and your Husband are being - this is not ok at all. You are hugely being taken advantage of."]}
