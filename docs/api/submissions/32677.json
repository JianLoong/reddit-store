I do not like getting drunk. I have gone to pubs without ordering alcoholic drinks. The issue at hand is not their decision to not drink alcohol; props to you mawma. The issue is using that as an excuse to not spend a single cent and taking up a table as a group in a busy pub that's providing entertainment and not making a single purchase, relying on me to be the only paying customer so they can enjoy the night.!<\n\nLet me elaborate; I have a group of friends that kinda doesn't drink alcohol. I say kinda, cause they actually do drink; like, they like mulled wine in winter (we drank it last week), and drink wine for dinners or special occasions. However, according to them, they do not like the mandatory association between social gathering and alcohol, so when we go to the pub, they don't drink.\n\nFine I get that. I don't really like to get drunk, the few times I go out I'll have 1 or 2 glasses of wine; sometimes nothing; that's not the problem. Now, in the UK, the law makes it mandatory for pubs and restaurants to provide free tap water, and here is where the problem with my friends arise.\n\nIf I go to a pub with them, they will ONLY order tap water, and that makes me feel so uncomfortable. I understand if you don't want to drink alcohol, fine, but order a juice and some crisps; an alcohol free beer; SOMETHING. If it was a group of, let's say, 5 people, and only one ordered water, I'd be like fine, whatever, but that's not the case. Let me give you an example.\n\nLast summer I went to this tiny indie pub that I adore, they had a sing along, great entertainment and the pub was full. The place is really tiny, like 6 tables maybe and 5 seats at the bar. We got there early and we sat at the bar; we stayed for 2 hours, the bar was so crowded and people were just standing. Only me and another friend ordered a couple beers; the other 3 friends just got water for the whole night, while sitting at the bar. Water, nothing else. I felt soooo uncomfortable.\n\nNow, why am I bringing this up months after that night?\n\nYesterday I asked one of these friends to go for a drink. She said yes, but she won't drink alcohol. I say, listen, they also have alcohol free beer, and you can get a juice. I don't feel comfortable going out on a Friday night without ordering; if you don't want to order we can go to the student association, cause there we can sit without ordering. She doesn't want to go to the student association, doesn't like the vibe and insist on going to a pub with her not ordering anything cause I'm ordering so it's fine. I cancel the night saying I'm not in the mood anymore.\n\nNow, the problem is that on Tuesday I have booked a table at a local pub. They have a drag bingo, is one of my favourite nights here. They provide FREE bingo tickets with prizes up to \u00a350, entertainment for the whole night, entrance is just \u00a32 and reserving a table is \u00a31 per person. Again, the place is not that big, it's ALWAYS full. I got a table for 3 people; one of these friends is that friend I asked out last night, the other one is another friend that doesn't drink. They seem oblivious to how rude that is (or maybe I'm the asshole?). I don't know what to do, and I'm thinking of cancelling the night (even though I already bought the tickets).\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this type of way about this situation? Or for wanting to cancel the night?

Why should they care if their friends are drinking. But now I understand.\n\nIt IS a bit inconsiderate to take up space at a small venue while not buying anything.   \n(It's even worse in places like the US because the staff won't get a tip on a $0 non-purchase, which means your friends would be costing the staff income.) Your issue is not that they aren't drinking alcohol, it's that they aren't making any purchases.\n\nSince they are students, and may not be able to afford eating/drinking out, I'm going with **NAH**. You are N T A for feeling uncomfortable, and they are N T A for not being able to afford to buy stuff.

It cost the pub to put on a drag bingo, hiring the drag queen, stock up and all, and they rely on folks to buy drinks to make money.  Christ, how tight do they have to be to not even buy a soft drink?  Are they really that oblivious?", "NTA but I also don\u2019t think you need to feel guilty by association.

You worded this badly. It\u2019s not about them not drinking alcohol, it\u2019s about them not ordering anything.", "These people are the reason for 2 drink minimums.  If you've never heard of this, I live in Las Vegas, karaoke is very popular here.  Lots of karaoke people, while being nice folks, will sit at the table for hours not drinking, so the venues will frequently enforce a 2 drink minimum to get some money out of them.", "NTA, but your friends are rude AF.

It's why two drink minimums are a thing.", "NTA..  it is rude to hold space in a restaurant and not purchase food or beverage. Here there is a minimum charge per person. You dont have to order alcohol or anything, but you will be on the bill.", "I was all set to be angry at you for pressuring people to drink, but that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s that they\u2019re taking up space at a business without purchasing anything and that\u2019s not okay. I don\u2019t drink often but I\u2019d at least buy a soda or juice and a snack! Or they could at least spring for some sparkling water if there are dietary concerns!\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Your friends are cheap and rude.", "And for what it's worth, I've worked at MANY bars and wouldn't drink tap water from a bar EVER.\ud83e\udd2e Ridiculous to not even be polite enough to order a soda, tea, coffee ....", "Is it possible you're \\*wildly\\* overthinking this?\n\nI know the UK doesn't have a tipping culture (which could partially solve this issue...order water only but leave a big tip as compensation), but if the bar staff/owner gets annoyed by freeloaders camping out, they'll just tell them to leave. \n\nAssuming that other patrons are looking at you, judging you, or feel you are complicit is just ... odd. Canceling a night out because of it even odder. Bar staff - no matter what type of bar it is - are perfectly capable of solving the situation if they choose. You don't have to do anything.\n\nTable/bar campers are annoying, but if the people who actually work there let it roll, there's no reason for you to be upset.\n\nNAH.", "Not necessarily TA but why do you keep inviting them knowing this will happen every time?  I would say this is on you know what the outcome will be.", "We called them campers. No server wants to waste their limited time, energy & tables on campers.", "I never tought people would sit there and buy nothing. That's embarassing", "It's a nice pub in Dundee, shame I'll be leaving the country in a week, I'm really going to miss it :c", "Yeah unfortunately they do not serve food - though I'm not sure that would make a difference in this case.", "Nice, someone that views it as my friends. Maybe you can elaborate and help me understand your perspective on this :)", "In the UK is mandatory for places that sell alcohol to provide customers with free water (yes I know, if they're not buying anything they are not technically customers).", "I mean, I do think it's unfair, and I do feel like I'm partaking in it. The reason why they feel it's fine it's cause I'm ordering. If I didn't go, I'm 100% sure they wouldn't just sit in two and order water.   \nAlso I don't think everybody will be watching us, but if the bar calls us out, that would be absolutely mortifying. I'm more scared of that.\n\nBut yeah, maybe you are right; I'll think about it :)", "I don't.    \nWe only had one pub night togheter, last summer.  \nThey want to go to drag bingo and are really excited about the night.", "Cranberry juice?!? \n\nWhat are ya, on yer period???", "Have you spoke to your friends?  Explained to them spending a few (hopefully more) pounds each will help keep the pubs open?", "Well, for me I\u2019m 16 right, I go to collage and don\u2019t work, \nI get like 5-10 pounds a week for food from collage plus like 120 each birthday + Christmas,\nWhich is one reason I just don\u2019t have the money to spend money like that\n\nIf I wanted something, like food or maybe extremely rarly a coke, I\u2019ll buy it but if I don\u2019t want something I\u2019m not going to go out of my way to get something, I just don\u2019t care enough about others to inconvenience myself for no reason, \n\nLike I grew up where I watched YouTube and streamers, or pirating stuff, so I\u2019m also probably used to not paying for entertainment, and while on YouTube I would love to sometimes pay, I hold no guilt for pirating and so that\u2019s probably a contributing factor\n\nAnd lastly as I mentioned I just don\u2019t drink anything but water unless it\u2019s an extremely special occasion as I mentioned in my original post.\n\nLike I definitely don\u2019t think your the asshole for thinking it\u2019s rude, but at the same time I don\u2019t see much wrong with what their doing, I would maybe ask them to pay the entrance and table fee atleast?", "Why are you going out drinking when you\u2019re broke and unemployed? Lmao", "Order it and when the bill comes pay yours and give them the ticket for the sodas.", "O. In the Netherlands they don't have to", "It's a basic mixer so it's a pretty safe bet that most places with a bar have it.  My logic when not drinking.  I also sometimes do ginger ale or sprite/starry.", "Are you gendering juice? What a weird thing to do", "Not many fans of The departed here I guess", "Absolutely NTA. Queer spaces are often small and busy. Post Covid a lot of pubs and bars are still struggling. Interesting that your friends like the vibe but are cool to not support the business in any meaningful way. One of my friends is sober and always gets non-alcoholic beer, juice or soda and tips on top. This isn\u2019t a difficult concept - support the places you love so they stay open!", "The only thing that sometimes annoys me about a two drink minimum is that food doesn\u2019t count as a drink. So I could buy bar food and a soda and still have to buy another soda/juice/coffee that I don\u2019t want.", "I have enough savings to be able to spend \u00a310 on a night out. Why are you comfortable commenting on a stranger's finances, knowing absolutely nothing about them?", "It's a quote from The Departed", "And what do you know of your friends finances? You don\u2019t know what debts or obligations they have if they don\u2019t tell you", "I know more about my friends' finances than you do, that's for sure.\n\nI never brought money in this conversation however cause it doesn't really have nothing to do with it. If they don't have enough money to pay for drinks that's fine, let's organise some activity that doesn't involve much money, like a dinner or something. \n\nYou talking about me being unemployed and my finances as if it had anything to do with the discussion is pretty disgusting.", "I think it\u2019s just weird how pissed off your getting at your \u2018friends\u2019, if the pub doesn\u2019t care then why do you?\n\nHow is it disgusting? You\u2019re quite sensitive, maybe don\u2019t post online if you don\u2019t want to read people disagreeing with you", "You assume the pub won't care, I assume we'll get called out and I'll look like a fool. I also feel like I'm partaking in something I just think it's unfair. I'm not pissed at my friends, I feel uncomfortable in that situation and I don't want to go. \n\nI haven't asked for your opinion on my finances and it has nothing to do with the conversation. You just took a cheap shot.", "Then don\u2019t hang out with them? \n\nCool, but you posted online and the topic is financial, you brought up your friends finances and yours are relevant. Again, don\u2019t post online if you\u2019re going to get this sensitive", "I'm not sensitive because you have an opinion, I'm just calling out your bullshit.\n\nI mentioned the financial situation cause this person assumed that the people involved were broke students. That's not the case. I clarified and pointed out to the irony of the fact that I'm the one that is tight on money at the moment.\n\nYou say I shouldn't go out if I'm unemployed. Who asked? What does that have to do with anything? You took a cheap shot, just own it instead of playing innocent."]}
