Some people are chill and other people will take absolutely everything and start screaming racism.

I was being introduced to a group of people, two actually, and one greeted me with hello and the other greeted me with hi. I automatically greeted them with the same word they had greeted me with but all of a sudden I was racist because the person I said \"hi\" to because that's what they said to me happened to be a black person and all of a sudden they were yelling and screaming how I was a racist because I wasn't showing them any respect by giving them the full word of hello like I did to the other person who happened to be white and then of course my friend who introduced us and the other girl also jumped up on me and we're saying what a nasty person I was and how was so racist and blah blah blah..\n\nThis is why I am an introvert. Because I hate these situations. Obviously people can tell when you're being racist versus when a comment is just being manipulated but not everybody is chill and some people literally look for a reason to yell and scream and point fingers.", "NTA. You wasn't trying to be hateful, you asked a question. Sure it was distasteful but you had been drinking. I'm sure if a white person did the same thing and the pen was white you'd ask the same with the wording of colour changed. \n\nThough I'm concerned, you're a minor who is with adults drinking and playing a sexual card game. I think the real issue is your workplace and the people you work with. Nobody said anything or was uncomfortable with a minor joining in? Has there been other situations where you've been in with co-workers in this manner?", "NTA, just a bit dumb \ud83d\ude02", "Weird context of underage drinking with adults aside, nope, I don't see a problem with what you said. I see a problem with a society that has somehow learned to be triggered by any mention of someone's skin color even in a context that says nothing negative about it. \n\nAnti racism is inherently a good thing but we've become so obsessed with showing our awareness that we're calling it out when it simply isn't there. \n\nI could tell you I think tattoos don't look like much on very dark skin. Barely visible. It's a relatively objective observation, at worst an opinion, and it has nothing to do with racialism.\n\nPeople need to take a step back and ask themselves, am I really being offended here, or have I just learned that I'm supposed to be offended, and if so, does it really make sense?", "NTA unless it was a light skinned black dude. Your comment wasn't that weird? I don't think any average black person would be offended, only people being offended on their behalf. Also weird and creepy as fuck that they're partying with you. Is anyone being inappropriate with you outside of that party?", "NTA. It was definitely not the most tactical thing you could've said, but I do believe you when you'd say you had no ill intentions.", "I'd bet my house that your co-workers aren't black", "Let's put it this way - your colleagues' actions, I e. drinking with a minor, and playing such game in the first place,  is way, way worse than your comment. This is not only extremely unprofessional, ir is straight up illegal. So don't worry. They are the bad guys here.", "NTA about you making a joke without bad intentions. Everyone's AH for making a minor drink with them. WTH?", "Nah.\nThey're just not fun drunks.\nAnd you shouldn't be getting drunk.", "NTA\n\nThat comment wasn't actually terribly racist. Besides which, it seems like everyone was drunk, so imprecise phrasing isn't really something to hold against anybody.", "I only read the title but NTA", "The game was to draw something crude on their skin right? Sounds like you played the game exactly as intended.", "So multiple adults were drinking with a minor and then got offended that black girl wouldn't get punished? NTA report them", "NTA. I shot tattoos in the joint for 4 years. Saved a lot of black dudes a lot of time money and disappointment, talking them out of colored ink. It's not racist to state a fact, especially one so obviously advantageous to the game they were playing.\nI just noticed you were making a joke. Also NTA because it's pretty funny and come on it's a fuckin joke. People your age have the thinnest skin.", "So, I'm gonna say yta. Does it matter it shows up? Have you thought of what you said after the fact and how it could've hurt her feelings? Have you tried empathize? I'm sure being in Australia, and depending on her skin tone, she probably heard it all before.\n\nTop many I think are focusing on the science and technical part of the marker, than the actual real feelings the actual person receiving it. She's gonna draw someone crude on someone (yeah part of the game) and yall really squabbling about it showing up? I mean, shit I wouldnt want that being clear as day on me anyway. Probably why she picked the color anyway. \n\nAnd then you got people \"well I'm black and wouldn't be offended because we're all in different shades!\" You ain't her! I'm not her either, but I can understand if she would feel offended and rightly so. And many of us may play it off with an awkward laugh and a, \"I guess haha...\" because what else can they do day to day to survive being black in a mostly white area? Similar to how women gotta be a certain way to make it through a place that's mostly men", "YTA.  That\u2019s dumb.  Drunk or not.", "Sticking to the actual issue:\n\nYTA. Even if you didn't *intend* it to be racist, it was taken offensively.

Which one is it? If it was a joke, I personally think YTA. If it was a genuine question because their skin was really dark and you weren't sure it would actually work on them like you said NTA. But then again, I'm not black so I can't really say anything so whatever black people here will say is the correct answer", "Hmmm ESH. I would make this comment to my friend, probably not to a co-worker. My husband is dark (Maori) and he would think nothing of a comment like that.", "I would like to add that I feel there\u2019s a lot of non Black people commenting and like read the room and step back from this one. Lots of Black people are give ranging opinions but as a non Black program you have no ability to understand how a comment like this could be received and nothing of value to add to the convo. Your opinion is truly irrelevant here and doesn\u2019t help OP, who from her comments truly wants to learn how her words impact \u201cTHOSE THEY ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS\u201d.\n\nWith that said since you said it\u2019s a joke then Y T A. It\u2019s ignorant and would definitely make me uncomfortable and othered. Especially as someone that grew up in a white majority country.

No what OP said was not racist, perhaps a bit blunt or even rude. No 17 year olds not supposed to drink\u2026 but they do. Drinking with 20 something colleagues hardly a predatory environment it\u2019s the sort of thing that is very normal 20 years ago - at least nobody would LOSE THEIR MIND over it.", "How do you know her boss and other co workers are 20?", "Then why are you replying to me???", "All these things massively depend on the work situation.\n\nA big office with a mix of people, probably better keep ot safe with HR.\n\nA small team that know each other well, almost anything goes depending on the group.  \n\nMy first job also introduced me to my first trial of cochineal, and my first visit to a strip club.  I didn't carry on with either but it was a period of great memories.\n\nI wouldn't expect that if I went to work in Tescos HQ or whatever.\n\nBasically, we don't all work the same jobs, don't shoot stuff down just because your work isn't the place for it", "People also doing it doesn't make it right either now does it?", "Alcohol is the ONLY drug that if you are physically addicted to and you want to quit, you have to go to a hospital to detox or you WILL die", "One place I worked at one of our students got \"accidentally\" drunk (it was a claim, we had a spiked punch on a different table from the regular punch - they claim they got confused and drank from the wrong bowl). No one was punished for it, but the next year there was no spiked punch. \n\nAnd to the creeper comment, 100% my first thought. A 17 year old girl drinking with adult coworkers is a danger risk for sure. Obviously the creeps are responsible for themselves but it feels skeevy that no one who wasn't the 17 year old pointed that out.", "How do you know they\u2019re not?", "Because you were talking about the post as well????

Other EU states have separate ages for drinking alcohol in public vs. private.\n\n\nThe UK, the laws of drinking alcohol vary based on country. In England and Wales, you can legally consume alcohol on a private residence from the age of 5, can consume some alcohol with a meal in public (if accompanied by an adult) at 16, and must otherwise be 18 to consume alcohol in public and purchase it.
