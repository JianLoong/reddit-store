Your comment was definitely weird, but it\u2019s also weird that your adult coworkers and your boss were drinking and partying with you, a minor.

I\u2019m white but sort of tanned so I thought on my skin but I\u2019m shit with figuring out stuff like this. A white crayon on a white paper doesn\u2019t show up. Is that the same damned thing? You might not know either but I would have thought the purple would have showed up fine no matter the shade of black.
