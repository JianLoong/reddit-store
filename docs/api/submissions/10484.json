Should he be letting her know ahead of time \u201cHey, I still have that sensory issue. It didn\u2019t go away since the last time you cooked\u201d? At some point far in the past, this stopped being a surprise to her. If instead of texture, it was that OP didn\u2019t like mushrooms and his gf cooked mushrooms at every meal, and then got upset when he didn\u2019t eat them, it would be obvious she either didn\u2019t care or was purposefully cooking things he wouldn\u2019t enjoy eating as-is. She knows and does it anyway.", "This. You can't put others to watch your disgusting things. Do you pick your nose in front of her?", "OP acknowledges that people have found it off putting which tells me it is having a negative impact. I question does he and girlfriend avoid social situations when they can\u2019t control the menu\u2026 sensory aversions increase not decreases if left to go unchecked. Longer he waits the harder it will be", "If OP ever had a business dinner, imagine doing that in front of coworkers. Your boss. Clients. If he's doing that at home, fine, but if I were a client dining with someone I was looking to hire - this would put me off _massively_.", "> but mushing food isn't a problem at all.\n\nIt really is. OP's gf may want to go to a nice fancy restaurant for example, and not worry about the looks they'll get when her bf is, as he says, \"beating his portion into a mushy pulp\".", "I am diagnosed with autism", "He\u2019s stated his diagnosed with autism.", "There is no need to overcome anything as OP is doing nothing wrong", "It is playing.", "That\u2019s just not the same thing", "the main issue here is people getting upset over someone else mushing *their own* food. If they're getting *that* upset by it that's a them problem.", "I don\u2019t think it should be expected or required to change every thing you might do that someone else doesn\u2019t like, especially something that harms nobody.", "I don't do this at restaurants I usually order foods that are already soft and if I can't do that I don't eat.", "Did I overead this? This is important. If you didn't already, you should add that information to your post. \n\nYour eating habit might be because of a sensitivity issue. If your gf doesn't know this, I totally understand her anger and you need to discuss this with her.", "OP, you say she's gotten increasingly annoyed with this habit. Have you explained to her why you do this? Does she know you're autistic? Is this the only thing she's upset with you about?", "Not being able to eat solid food is kind of a big deal\u2026", "Is this aversion something you'd like to get over?  There are therapy techniques that could help you.  If it's not, you need to be honest with your girlfriend that this is how you will always eat your food.  Just know that it might very well be a deal breaker for her and for others.", "Yeah she knows I have autism, I can't think of any other issues we've had really. I've tried explaining it to her but I don't think I do a very good job.", "Honestly I don't really know.", "Ok. You might get some more help for your situation if you post in one of the advice or autism subs. This seems like it could be a communication issue."]}
