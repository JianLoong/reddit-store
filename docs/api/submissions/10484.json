Maybe you do the mushing in a separate room. Maybe you start an Instagram of \"beautiful food my gf makes for me\" and post a picture, and give a compliment, before you mush. Maybe once a week you have a meal or a part of a meal that is served as a mash (potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, yogurt etc,). Maybe once a week you make a point of eating things together that you don't eat as a mush - sandwiches or popcorn or popsicles or crackers & cheese or veggies & dip.\n\nI am also autistic and look at relationship hiccups like this as a puzzle.

My personal opinion is that I don't care if we match or if we drink the same drink or eat the same foid, if I'm there to hang out with you, the hanging out is the important part.

I'm autistic and I used to do this too. My spouse initially was weirded out by it, but they realized that I was struggling with the textures and we started working on making foods with slightly softer or more uniform textures to get me used to things.

You don't have to actually do any cooking if she doesn't want you to--in my experience, doing the dishes while my spouse cooks so they don't have any mess to deal with is a big help. Offering to help with things like that is a good way to show her you appreciate her and want to make cooking easier for her. \n\nThen, I would ask her if she would be willing to work with you on picking some recipes with textures that are closer to what you're comfortable with, but still a bit outside your comfort zone. Explain that you'd like to be able to fully appreciate the texture of what she cooks, but that it'll take some time for you to acclimate yourself to those textures, so you want to start slow.

It's also not acceptable table manners for adults in social situations.

If this is a texture-sensitivity issue connected with your autism, then it makes sense. If it is not connected to that, and is simply something you\u2019ve always done, you should explore ways of ending the habit without causing yourself distress.

I'm autistic and also deal with sensory issues, though usually it's not with food. For those that don't know, sensory issues, depending on how severe, can be debilitating. When I do find texture issues with my food, it becomes physically impossible for me to eat without gagging. To expect this man to just \"deal\" when he is harming no one and is simply making his food accessible for himself is asinine and entitled behavior. He's the one having to put it in his mouth, his brain is the one having to process the sensory information, so it should be entirely up to him on the texture of his food. As other comments stated his girlfriend must have known of his eating habits prior to them moving in, and her suddenly making a big deal out of it feels controlling. She needs to get over herself. She's not eating it, it shouldn't affect her, and for her to expect her boyfriend to suffer though sensory issues like that is just wrong and makes her an AH. \n\nAlso op, I think you should even feel comfortable enough to mush your own food in restaurants.

This wasn't a surprise for your girlfriend, she knows this is a thing for you, she'll either accept it or she won't.

You have your preferences.\n\nBut I don't think she's an asshole for being hurt, either. Cooking for you is a way for her to express affection to you.

I put in this effort and can't make him like it. He has to smash my hard work.\"\n\nIt just comes across as two people having different associations with food.", "NTA. Everyone has preferences for how they like their food. I love putting hot sauce on pretty much everything. My husband thinks it\u2019s strange and a little gross. He never gets mad at me though (he does most of the cooking). You aren\u2019t hurting yourself or others by doing this. If someone finds it uncomfortable that\u2019s on them, not you. I eat my food in sections (I have to eat one thing completely before moving onto another (eg. Eat carrots first, then mashed potatoes, then steak)) people bug me about it sometimes cause they think it\u2019s strange, but it\u2019s not hurting anyone. Same thing goes for this. If it was going to be that big of a deal for your gf, she shouldn\u2019t have stayed in the relationship. If this is her hill to die on then fine, she can leave.

Would you say that's accurate, or is it just calmly mashing?~~ *Nevermind, saw you answer this part in another comment*", "Oh, I see people doing that all the time with foods? like a baked potato, or soft meats like pulled pork or fish. Maybe for your gf it's just that it's 'unusual' to see unexpected mannerisms? Ive seen others get disgusted over things like eating macaroni with a spoon, putting the mashed potatoes and corn in the same bite, not eating the pizza crusts, dipping the grilled cheese in the tomato soup, eating welldone steak, saving the fried chicken skin for last, etc. I had a person really offended over some plain bell peppers as a snack and acted like I was eating a bowl of hamsters. Some people are bothered to see food not consumed 'the one true way'.", "Okay - so when you mush it, do you mush the whole plate of food and then start eating? Or do you cut off a bite, mush, and then eat?", "Yes, English-born here. I don't think I could even eat shepherd's pie or cottage pie without mixing the mince and potato together (after picking off - with a fork! - the crusty grilled potato top)...", "Because it's disgusting!

Spraying your gross ass mouth germs on other peoples food absolutely can hurt others.", "Then... don't share a table with them? I have ended associations with people because I didn't enjoy the way they did things, that were perfectly harmless but got on my nerves. It wasn't a 'them' problem, it was a 'me' problem - I stopped being able to enjoy being around them, and **it wasn't my right to tell them they should change to keep from making me uncomfortable**, so I removed myself from the situation. End of.", "Sorry, but autistic people are more than capable of growing as a person and improving themselves. Autism isn't a get out of jail free card for every situation.

I don't know if I really have money for any kind of therapy to be honest.", "It depends on what the sides are. Usually I mush whatever part of the meal i'm going to eat first (like salmon) and then eat that and move onto the next thing.", "My mind immediately went to a garbage plate or thanksgiving dinner. You're meant to have a bit of everything in each bite.\n\n(Of course, as an autistic myself, I want my thanksgiving dinner pieces all staunchly divided, but to each their own!)", "Eating with your mouth open doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, yet it\u2019s super gross and off putting to watch.

And don\u2019t just say \u201chow is he going to eat out at a fancy place\u201d or anything else that relates to social conventions because that\u2019s just pushing masking on an autistic person and that\u2019s ableist as fuck.

If you were interested, there are lots of resources online, too, but again it would only be if *you* ever felt like you wanted a change.

With that, and the fact that you don't do this publicly I'll say NTA.", "Exactly, when a person's sitting \n across the table from someone and they're exposed \"off putting\" things that gross others out it ruins the meal for them. Socially established table manners exist for a reason. I watched a friend put a half a stick of butter on a slice of baguette and struggled to keep my bite of down and refrain from rudely gasping. Same friend will drown mexican food in so much sour cream that you can't see what she ordered.
