Maybe you do the mushing in a separate room. Maybe you start an Instagram of \"beautiful food my gf makes for me\" and post a picture, and give a compliment, before you mush. Maybe once a week you have a meal or a part of a meal that is served as a mash (potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash, yogurt etc,). Maybe once a week you make a point of eating things together that you don't eat as a mush - sandwiches or popcorn or popsicles or crackers & cheese or veggies & dip.\n\nI am also autistic and look at relationship hiccups like this as a puzzle.

My personal opinion is that I don't care if we match or if we drink the same drink or eat the same foid, if I'm there to hang out with you, the hanging out is the important part.

When I do find texture issues with my food, it becomes physically impossible for me to eat without gagging. To expect this man to just \"deal\" when he is harming no one and is simply making his food accessible for himself is asinine and entitled behavior. He's the one having to put it in his mouth, his brain is the one having to process the sensory information, so it should be entirely up to him on the texture of his food. As other comments stated his girlfriend must have known of his eating habits prior to them moving in, and her suddenly making a big deal out of it feels controlling. She needs to get over herself. She's not eating it, it shouldn't affect her, and for her to expect her boyfriend to suffer though sensory issues like that is just wrong and makes her an AH. \n\nAlso op, I think you should even feel comfortable enough to mush your own food in restaurants.

I eat my food in sections (I have to eat one thing completely before moving onto another (eg. Eat carrots first, then mashed potatoes, then steak)) people bug me about it sometimes cause they think it\u2019s strange, but it\u2019s not hurting anyone. Same thing goes for this.

Maybe there is a way for you to prepare your plate without her feeling like you are disrespecting the work she put in. Good luck!", "I absolutely love this advice, it's so compassionate and practical. \n\nI was severely neglected as a child and had major food insecurity issues, and to this day I cannot share a plate of food (except now with my kiddos but ita still hard) and someone taking a plate away from me when theres still food on it triggers me to all hell. I also had an ex-husband weaponize food, specifically my cooking, against me and did so in public in a way that no one would have known he was being abusive.\n\nWhen I cook food, it's out of a place of love, like a sacrificial love offering as a love language. I have my recipes I have honed over the years and will be the first one to offer up making a recipe gluten free, or nut free, whatever needs to be made for that person or their child, because so often asking for those restrictions feels as a burden, and I GET to make them something out of a loving place. \n\nMy forever-husband and I have had to figure out how to make this work. He is a food mixer. And in my background culture there is a lot of food layering, and some foods that are mixed are considered \"poor, unloved, neglected\" foods. So to see him mix the food I make him elicits a VISCERAL response in me that is SO hurt. His family also, always, without fail will criticize food as small talk. We have gone no contact with them, but the habits die hard. \n\nSo hubby will always, in love and respect for the tender area of my heart this affects, always take the first bite, without mixing, and without seasoning it first. So that he tastes it how I lovingly prepared it, first. \n\nIf he feels the need to mix or add seasoning, he then does so discreetly. Sometimes there with me, just casual and not obvious, sometimes when I'm extra triggered like during pregnancies, he'll \"forget something\" in the kitchen and do it in there, in order to just be kind and protect my heart. \n\nSeeing him mix still bothers me, but (especially when he takes the first bite unmolested) I actively let it go, and remember that this is one of his wants and needs, that he has preferences, and I love him by not making rules or such with food. We dont have rules for each other, we have things we do in kindness so show love, but they aren't rules. \n\nWe also don't ever ever ever make our kids eat (or finish) anything, not even a \"try bite\" but we do say they aren't allowed to say they don't like it if they haven't tried it first, because they havent actually tried it, they dont know that... and they just plain aren't allowed to say something is gross, it's not kind. If we don't like a certain color, look, texture, etc we can use better more objective words to describe that. And we heavily encourage always thanking someone for making food, even if we didn't want to try it, or didn't like it, they still used time and energy to make it and that should be appreciated. \n\nAnd if food has to be thrown away, even if it's my food, he doesn't throw it away in front of me. I will give him my plate, and he will discreetly \"make it so\", without me there, because of my childhood. If something needs constructive criticism we try to frame it objectively and in a action oriented way (I say we as he is learning cooking currently) like \"man, that was so good, next batch we should try adding X, I think it could be even better!\" Or \"I'd really like to try it next time without X, so that the Y flavor can come out more\"", "what could valid feelings mean?", "why are you staring at his food? noone wants to watch you stuff food in your mouth maybe you should hide when you open it.", "I recently discovered this couple and it's fantastic watching them!

He is describing it like it\u2019s a compulsion or like he *needs* to at some level. He only orders already mush food at restaurants.  This is consistent with autism.  It\u2019s a minor thing,affects no one else, it can be viewed as a personal idiosyncrasy.  A healthy couple might well deal with it with mild humor, and it would be a non issue.  A healthy couple might also just not pay attention to it.  Not ignore it in an unhealthy way, just assign it no importance.    \n\nNTA", ">I intentionally avoid doing this in public\n\nWell, the reason *why* you avoid doing it in public is because you're aware that seeing someone eat this way is off-putting and unsettling. People are being unnecessarily harsh with their wording, but they're right to point out that your girlfriend isn't a bad person for being disturbed by a habit that you admit is generally disturbing to witness. They're also right to point out that your girlfriend may be bothered by the realization that her eating enjoyment is secondary to the comfort of strangers.\n\nI suspect part of this is because people aren't factoring in \"masking\" and how you probably want your home environment to be somewhere you can exist as yourself without having to \"mask.\" Without that context of wanting to be comfy at home, it raises the questions about why you prioritize strangers over the person you're dating. Note that your girlfriend may also not have that context so this may also be a reason why she's so hurt.\n\n>I don't think this is an egregious thing I'm not like spitting food all over the place or something like that.\n\nIt isn't unsanitary like spitting, but it is still off-putting and it's okay for her to be bothered by seeing that. It's similar to being disgusted by people who chew with their mouths open. Neither habit is harmful, but they can still ruin another person's appetite.\n\nMore importantly, it seems to feel insulting to her cooking skills - and I think she's right. There's no point in cooking a well executed meal for someone who doesn't appreciate those qualities. Your girlfriend takes a lot of pride in her cooking skills *which includes texture* and it has to be disheartening to see someone then systematically ruin the dish that she spent time and effort cooking in the way the dish is meant to be made. \n\nTo be clear, this does NOT mean you have to stop eating mush.\n\nHowever...I think your girlfriend should cook whatever she wants *for herself only* and you cook for yourself. Then, if she happens to be making something that already has a soft texture, she can share those dishes with her. But if she is planning to make a non-soft dish, it's silly (and honestly depressing) for her to make that for you then watch you destroy that work; it makes far more sense for you to just make yourself something simple and soft instead.\n\nAlso, can you stop \"beating\" the entire plate? This would likely go a long way towards reaching a middle ground. \"Beating\" suggests you're unnecessarily aggressive with how you mash your food which would be distracting during a meal. And there's *no* need to mush the entire plate at once if it's a texture issue, you can smush each bite before eating it. Seeing someone eating discoloured goop would be disturbing, but someone mushing the bite they're about to eat is a non-factor. In fact, it would be a good way to be able to eat comfortably in public if there isn't a soft enough food on the menu for you to eat without mushing it.\n\nETA: finished sentence (too enter too soon)", "\"Who cares\" is unfortunately the GF. They have different needs, and neither is getting met. Since OP never told us why GF finds this behaviour so repulsive, we can't assume that it isn't equally valid. Both sound like they have food \"rules\" that the other is breaking.", "So your go-to to defending autistic people is to also accuse people you think are annoying as \"autistic\" as well?

But, they must express them accurately and with logic.  OP isn\u2019t hurting his GF in any manner.  She is misinterpreting his actions.  She is saying she feels hurt because he doesn\u2019t like her food. 1) that is not fair.  He DOES like her food.  But he always mushes food, because that is what he has to do. 2) even if he didn\u2019t like her food, people don\u2019t always like the same things, and it\u2019s unreasonable to take your disappointment out on someone else.  \n\nFor OP, objecting to him mushing his food would be like objecting to someone else for cutting their steak into bite sized pieces instead of biting iff a chunk from the whole piece.", "They're allowed their feelings, they're not allowed tantrums and manipulation tactics to get their way.

You very rarely get the opportunity to eat like this outside your home.\n\n2) Your girlfriend thinks the way you mash your food is insulting to her cooking. Probably because the presentation of food is important to someone who cooks. \n\n3) There may be an issue with the way you mash food as well.

Were you forced to eat certain foods as a child ? Do your teeth hurt ? Do you have mouth ulcers ? Can you make a list of non-soft foods you can eat, if any ? Can you eat curries and stews ? With rice ? Spaghetti bolognaise ? With pasta ? Its worth digging down into all this stuff, so that you can explain it to your gf clearly and concisely. \n\n2) What *exactly* is pissing your gf off here ? Is it destroying her food presentation ? Does your mashing disgust her ? If so, why ? Is it the sound ? The action itself ? What tood looks like afterwards ?\n\n3) Which leads to point three - if you are actually \u201cbeating your food to a pulp\u201d then that may be way too much for her to put up with. It the same way that you need to be comfortable eating in your own house, *so does she.* If that\u2019s what the issue is, can you mash less brutally ? \n\nLook, one of my sons has misophonia and we get around mealtimes by him not eating with us. He copes in restaurants with a combination of sound modifying earplugs and background noise. It makes me a bit sad, but its genuinely unpleasant for him.

I\u2019m one of those people who doesn\u2019t like it when foods run into each other (I don\u2019t mean I\u2019ll have a fit if my meat touches my potatoes, I just prefer if the juice from corn doesn\u2019t run into my mashed potatoes, for example. Or I don\u2019t like sauces/gravies on most things)  My dad used to say \u201cyou do know all your food is going to get mixed together in your stomach, right?!\u201d", "I'm a normal mid 40s woman and i love mushing my food when im eating alone or at home but not in public. I love soggy cereal, i love mushing my rice with the sauce and meat chunks and enjoy it in one scope. think of it like bibimbap and mushing everything together then having the perfect bite every single time. Just LOVE my food looks and taste one everything is mixed and mushed.\n\nEDIT: surprisingly enough that does not apply to fruits. I hate mushing fruits. I love whole fruits and hate their syrup. Like i LOVE tomatoes and asked for extra to be added on my dish but hate ketchup. I LOVE strawberries but hate their syrup or even mixed in yogurt, Love apples but hate apple sauce...\n\nthink i'm weird", "That sounds less off putting IMHO. I don\u2019t think you are the AH, but if this is unappetizing for her to witness, and if she is grossed out, it is going to cause problems. Did you ask her if it is that she finds it rude or if it is actually repellent to her? It makes a difference. Rudeness you can explain away, but if she finds it repellent, her reaction is more visceral.  Would you be able to eat and enjoy the food without mashing? Will you gag otherwise? If not, can you try to accommodate her? She also has a responsibility to understand that because you are autistic, food texture is a real issue for you.

I smush the insides out and eat all the insides last, while eating the shells as i squish them. I'm pretty sure I saw either my mom or a older sibling do that as a child and ever since then that is the only way I can eat them. But in my defense, I don't burn my mouth eating them this way, and they don't explode into my mouth when I bite into them. People think it's weird, but its a method that works for me, not hurting myself. And no one has been able to argue that it doesn't work.\n\nI've also been a picky eater my whole life (better with age), so I completely understand people's food quirks. I also don't like the smell of popcorn, but I won't vomit if I smell it. Weirdly popcorn at the movies doesn't really bother me, smell wise. But if my coworker makes it, I'm internally grumbling about it for half the day.", ">OP isn\u2019t hurting his GF in any manner. She is misinterpreting his actions.\n\nThese two things aren't mutually exclusive though. It's equally possible that she's misinterpreting his actions *and* that her feelings are coming from a valid place that isn't immediately apparent to him. The original comment in this chain ~~you replied to~~ gave a bunch of really good suggestions for OP to identify and meet both their needs, for instance if it's not really about about the mushing and more about her feeling that he doesn't appreciate her food. \n\nCommunication between neurotypical couples is hard. I'm sure neurodivergent couples have challenges too.\nCouples where one partner is neurotypical and the other is neurodivergent have communication challenges, and I know that from experience. You can't just write things off as \"I'm being logical and you're being emotional and therefore I can dismiss your emotions without concerning myself with what's causing them\" and expect to find a solution that works for everyone. It's on both of them to problem solve this together.", "THANK YOU! People act as if they can't be called out for their offputting behaviors because of autism/ARFID, and it's like ???? People are ALLOWED to be similarly disgusted by your behavior, excuse or not.", "I was responding to \u201cpeople are allowed to have feelings\u201d.  I\u2019m arguing that when your feelings are a result of misjudging someone else and *not listening to them* you have an obligation to back up and *stop*.   Listen, re-evaluate, and deal with them on your own, recognizing that they are a you problem, not the other\u2019s fault.", "I have never criticized the way anyone has eaten food, because I've never been in the presence of someone who's done anything worth mentioning. Because the vast majority of the population do not do anything weird with their food. \n\nOf my husband all of a sudden started doing something weird with the food I made him, I'd tell him to make his own food. I don't care what people do with their food. I care that people destroy the food I cooked FOR them. \n\nThat's the part I have a problem with. I'm just not going to cook for someone who doesn't appreciate my cooking.", "Yeah I'm sorry, when I initially commented I thought you'd replied to the top-level comment, hence my edit. My bad!\n\nI still disagree with the concept that the two statements initially presented are mutually exclusive, and the idea that you have to present emotions logically. I definitely think both of them have an obligation to work this out together. Your statement applies just as much to OP as it does to the gf. Something is going wrong here - maybe it's just lost in translation, maybe it's not but the only way they can figure it out is by communicating and problem solving together. \n\nEmotions aren't one person's problem either, we're all growing and learning together and it's usually more productive to figure these things out together in the long term. Usually involves a lot of communication, which I think we both agree these guys need to do to work this out.", "Mixing together is completely separate from mushing things into a pulp. How about you mind **your** own business and quit policing how people react to the way others eat?!? You don't know what anyone else is dealing with, either.", "And so does your girlfriend. YTA", "It sounds like OP is struggling to explain to his girlfriend why this sensory need is more than a weird habit. And maybe she hasn't explained (or explained in a way that OP understands) why this is so offensive to her. Has the girlfriend actually said \"hey I take a lot of care to cook things with the proper texture and it feels dismissive of my efforts to mix and mash it together\"? Does the scraping of the fork annoy her? Table manners are very arbitrary. OP doesn't seem to be policing his gf's reactions, it's just really important that he has a space where he doesn't have to mask.", "It is only a weird habit: He\u2018s only doing it at home and has no problem eating elsewhere without.\n\nTable manners are arbitrary? Some rules are but a lot of stuff is universal. Blending your food into  mush at the table is probably one of the universal no-nos.", "NTA. Once the food is in the mouth it would get smushed either way. You just do it sooner. It doesn't change the taste of the food and you like the food of your GF after all, which should make her happy.", "NTA. You're on the spectrum, you have a texture thing. Even if you weren't, you have a texture thing. Have y'all not talked about your autism and how to make things work?", "NTA. She\u2019s TA, as she knows that you have autism and have eating habits that are as they are because of your autism.", "NTA. Maybe it\u2019s just because I\u2019m autistic myself, but I can\u2019t fathom getting upset about this. I understand how it can be strange, sure. But at the end of the day, you\u2019re eating the food, which I believe is a form of respect in itself. This is especially because you\u2019re not doing this in public, only in your home with someone you\u2019re supposed to be comfortable around. I\u2019m always a bit wary of non-autistic people moralizing a harmless action of an autistic person, especially if it\u2019s something small like this. Pay attention to how she handles situations like this in the future. \n\nHere\u2019s where I try to actually say something productive. You guys need to have a talk so you can understand why this upsets her, and she can understand that this is a neutral action for you and isn\u2019t indicative of how you feel about her food. That requires a willingness from both of you to *listen* to each other and find a way to compromise (not saying you haven\u2019t shown that). What that looks like is up to you guys.", "YTA. Please refrain from sperging too hard if you can. That said, share some resources about the 'tism with your girlfriend if you haven't already so she understands it's a sensory thing and not you being possessed by the spirit of a picky-eating 3 year old. \n\nConsider it a chance to help yourself grow with the woman you like, instead of letting your neurological conditions define you. Maybe have her start withs stews and whatnot and work your way up?", "NTA\n\nAlso, want to be snarky\n\n>I've been doing it for years and I just don't seem to enjoy food as much when it isn't smushed\n\nYea, so has everyone else, its called chewing.", "NTA if you eat your food in the end what does it matter for her? If you wouldn't eat then it would be disrespectful, but that's not the case. She should get over herself and aplogise to you.", "NTA.", "NTA. But you can manage this in a restaurant, why not give it a go at home too? Maybe not every meal, just once or twice a week? See how it goes?", "I just wanna know how the girlfriend could witness the food mushing for so long, not put 2 and 2 together (te ture sensitivity) and buy op a food processor or blender that's eaay to clean so he can massively save on time before eating as the food will get all chopped up, making it immensely easier to mush. Plus, she can also probably use it for her own reasons. Total win, OP, maybe look into buying a food processor", "I had an ex who got mad if mixed my food. Like turkey and mashed potatoes in the same bite. I sometimes pick up the meat with the fork then scoop it into the potatoes to get them and the gravy on it. He said I wasn't \"properly appreciating my turkey.\" \n\nThat's one of the many reasons he's an ex. Also my mom and both grandparents smash certain foods. Mom might be on the spectrum but my grandparents aren't. And I have some texture issues that prevent me from eating certain things. But it's not okay to gatekeep enjoying food.", "Yeah are people actually pretending they'd just be fine with this? \n\n\n\nHe's not an asshole but no way I'd eat with someone who did this.

How do you mash it up exactly?", "Other people are allowed to have issues surrounding food and eating. It's OK that op hash to mash his food, but it is also OK if someone can't sit across the table and watch/listen to him \"beat his food to mush\". \n\nIt's OK for someone not to be able to stomach loud eaters or people who chew with their mouths open, or someone mixing their food to slop, etc...\n\nAvoiding people with off-putting eating habits isn't policing them.
