I also stand by my comment. Maybe having the crush coming over right now is not the right thing as they navigate how to get things sorted in the household, but the fact that a 16 year old kid doesn't necessarily know how to navigate this isn't shocking and there needs to be some room for him to have privacy and conversations with his family about his crush.", "Whilst taking her in is very nice of you, you can't dictate who your son likes or who decides to be with. It's a complicated situation I wish you the est of luck figuring this out but don't alienate your son.", "INFO, was your son unhappy you allowed her to move in? Was he ever happy about it?", "YWBTA\n\nBelieve it or not, I was in a pretty similar situation to that girl once. At 15 I moved in with my boyfriend and his dad. We broke up, because teenage relationships rarely last long and definitely aren't built for living together. He brought home boys (I am female) he was dating. It sucked, but it was his house too. Why should he be punished for not tying himself to me forever? We were kids. Although for the record, the gender of his new crushes/relationships really didn't factor into how much it sucked.\n\nIt's commendable what you're doing for this girl, but she's not your son's responsibility. He needs to be allowed to live his life and explore his identity, and he needs to feel safe to be himself at home.", "YWBTA\n\nIt is great that you are helping this girl and are providing her a safe and stable home. That being said, it doesn\u2019t mean you can force your son to continue dating her. He is a teenager figuring things out and is entitled to do that in the safety of his own home.", "YTA. You're sort of forced into being some kind of asshole regardless - you can be TA to this teen girl you're caring for or you can be TA to your son. It sounds like you're currently filling a caregiver role for this girl and are doing your best to protect her, but in doing so you're putting her feelings about a breakup over your son's ability to live a normal life in his home. He's likely going to take this as you being unsupportive of his sexuality, even if that isn't what it is about. \n\nI think it's kind you're still letting her stay with you even though they are broken up, but I don't think it's reasonable to put limits on your son's new relationship to make his ex more comfortable since it doesn't sound like he had any say in that decision.", "The entire process of you semi-adopting your kid's teenage girlfriend is weird, but isn't really relevant except that she's a teenage girlfriend.\n\nYou are choosing to value that teenage girlfriend above your son, which is shitty. She isn't your kid, and while letting her stay with you is a nice thing, you cannot seriously think she's more likely to remain in your life than your son is. Even if she was your kid, your behavior would absolutely be treating her as the golden child and your son as an afterthought whose only purpose is serving, again, his teenage girlfriend. Trying to control his romantic relationships because you care more about his teenage ex will permanently break his trust in you and, justifiably, will probably lead to him thinking you're homophobic bigots. YTA.", "YWBTA imo. You\u2019re doing a really great thing for her by providing a safe place to live. However high school romances rarely last, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to your son to just bar the kid from the house. This would be a good teaching moment to teach your son about empathy and tact and to have respect for the turmoil that she is currently going through and to be mindful of other peoples feelings.", "YTA!!! Your son is 16, he\u2019s learning about himself, if he likes boys then he likes boys. By kicking his crush out of the house you\u2019re just showing YOUR OWN SON that he doesn\u2019t have a safe space in his house, because why girlfriend ok but boy crush isn\u2019t?", "Of course YWBTA. You don't have a right to dictate your son's love life, and just because you like this girl more doesn't mean your son has to put his life on hold to protect her. Telling your son he can't date someone of any gender because you want to spare his ex's feelings is just ridiculous.", "\"If that wasn't bad enough\"\n\nSTOP. STOP RIGHT THERE.\n\nYTA. I have nothing more to say. jfc.\n\nETA: OP made clear that they referred to the break up and not the boy. I apologized for assuming. It's in the comments. I made a judgment but have no problem recognizing I was in the wrong about the sentence.", "YTA. It was nice from you to take the poor girl in, BUT 1. Did you ask your son about it?\n2. Did you really expect them to stay together forever? At 16?\n3. Why did he consider her as \"horrible\"?\n4. Do you want to ruin your relationship with your son over this ex-girlfriend?\n5. Your \"bad enough\" statement sounds homophobic", "**YTA**\n\nWhile it was incredibly kind of you to take this girl into your home when her own home situation was untenable, it is incredibly inappropriate to interfere with your son's emotional and social life on her behalf unless he is directly and deliberately harming her (which he is not, and if he were your home wouldn't be a safe place for her anyway). \n\nFrankly, while you don't give your age, I find it worrisome that as an adult old enough to have a teenaged son of your own, you don't understand the difference between offering support and a reasonable parent/guardian relationship to this girl, and taking it upon yourself to orchestrate/manipulate relationships happening around her just to make her happy. The former is healthy and generous . . . the latter is DEEPLY problematic and unhealthy.\n\nIt is NOT YOUR SON'S RESPONSIBILITY TO LIMIT HIS OWN ROMANTIC LIFE TO PROTECT ANOTHER TEENAGER. It is not his responsibility to stay in a romantic relationship with her that he doesn't want (that's coercion, and abusive); it's not his responsibility to avoid living his life and having healthy social experiences and relationships because it might upset her.\n\nYOUR SON'S LIFE DOES NOT EXIST AS A COROLLARY TO THIS GIRL'S. He is an entire human being, deserving of autonomy and support from you, his parent, as he grows through adolescence, as much as she does.  In fact, as your own child, where there is any question, he should be your priority. \n\nYTA. This girl needs therapy, but so do you, because you clearly don't have any healthy or mature understanding of boundaries.", "YTA. As much sympathy as you have for this girl, she\u2019s your son\u2019s EX. And HE is YOUR SON. HE shouldn\u2019t be punished or restricted in his OWN HOME because his parents semi-adopted his ex girlfriend. You put him in an insanely uncomfortable and awkward situation and you\u2019re expecting him to put his life on hold and to accommodate for her because of a decision YOU made.\n\nEDIT: forget everything else I said\u2014this girl was not only a terrible gf but was toxic and abused/assaulted your son (\u201cdid something\u201d that you didn\u2019t ask him for more details/didn\u2019t believe him) and you *still moved her in?* I don\u2019t care if she\u2019ll be homeless otherwise\u2014you moved in your son\u2019s abuser, or at least someone that made him miserable\u2014and now you\u2019re punishing HIM? You\u2019re a failure of a parent if the implications of those comments are true.", "YWBTA if you banned him. Will you ban your son from ever bringing someone home? If this new person was female, would that change your thoughts?\n\n\nHowever, I'd suggest having a chat with your son and advising he is at least sensitive to his ex's feelings whilst they're so recently broken up. Sounds like she could still use your support, but that also shouldn't mean your son isn't allowed a partner from this point forward.", "YTA. It's better she cries now and not when they're married and have kids.", "Info\n\nWho suggested she move in? Him or you?\n\nIf it wasn't him then it may have been he was already planning on ending the relationship and would you expect him to continue indefinitely?\n\nHow long do you plan for her to live with you and him not have someone round?  If short term then it's reasonable but not forever", "YWBTA. If I thought this was remotely true. And if hypothetically it was, I'd say you don't deserve your son.", "INFO: Were you aware that your son is bisexual? It seems odd that they would be together for so long and then he just dumps her. It feels like there are some details missing.", "YWBTA - Like, big time. Did you expect your son to marry this girl? He's 16 for god's sake. You're doing a nice thing for this girl, but she is NOT your child. Your SON is and you should be focusing on helping him grow up and find himself, whether that is as a gay individual or a straight one. It is not your choice. And telling your son that he can't see this boy that he likes? All he is going to do is see him without your knowledge, because teens gonna teen.", "INFO\n\nWhat did your son say to you as she was moving in? Did he ask for it? Was he okay with it? Because if he was, it\u2019s an asshole move on his part to do this after agreeing to her moving in. \n\nI feel like if he was dating another girl, some of the replies in here would be different. Obviously teen romances usually don\u2019t last, but 16 years old is old enough to understand tact.", "ESH. \n\nWhile you had the best intentions, now that their relationship ended you should be prioritising getting this girl a different home. There\u2019s no other solution here. \n\nWhile your son is factually right and his feelings about his home/new relationship/the breakup are valid, his behaviour is very callous and he could learn some empathy while his ex is still, temporarily, under your roof. \n\nWhile the ex girlfriend\u2019s hurt feelings are valid, and I feel very sorry for her, there\u2019s no way she can expect to stay with you and not witness her ex having other relationships that include home visits.", "You need to extricate yourself from your sons love life entirely.  It doesn\u2019t matter who your son has a crush on, your job now is to provide a welcoming space for whoever your son brings home and, if possible, a safe space for a child who might be crying about a breakup because she thinks it will make her homeless.  The only thing harder than 16 is stewardship of a 16 year old, Godspeed.", "YTA. You're very kind and compassionate toward this girl and that's a positive trait, but your son comes first in your life. You never should have taken her in. \n\nYou weren't thinking. Social services HAS to be involved with a minor under the age of 18. Have you called them? If not, you're breaking the law (in the US) and will be accountable for anything that might happen to her while in your care. If she gets seriously hurt, you could go to jail. \n\nYou cannot provide a home for a minor child who is not yours unless you're a qualified foster parent who has been vetted. \n\nAnd again, your son comes first, last, and always.", "YTA. You moved your sons girlfriend into the house without even consulting with him first about whether he would be comfortable with that? And now that he\u2019s come out to you as gay, something that is incredibly scary and vulnerable, and you\u2019re reacting by denying him and favoring his now ex girlfriend over him. That is beyond fucked up. How do you think that makes your son feel? I can tell you it almost certainly makes him feel rejected by you. You need to be finding a new place for ex girlfriend to live. And banning your sons boyfriend from coming over? Major AH move. All that\u2019s going to do is make your son resent you and think you don\u2019t accept his sexuality. Find the ex a new place to live and stop being such a homophobe.\n\nEdit to say how sad I feel for your son. He\u2019s a teenager going through an extremely turbulent time in his life and you\u2019ve put him in a position where now he can\u2019t talk openly about his feelings because you\u2019re favoring his ex over him. I mean dude, he\u2019s not gonna get back together with her, get over it. You can\u2019t guilt him into not being gay.", "YWBTA. Talk to your son about being more thoughtful and kind  towards her and give him a chance to improve. \n\nThis situation is really complicated and it sounds like she needs some external support. I don't think staying at her ex's house is a long term solution to the situation with her mom. Time to get her in with a school social worker or something to start getting her future more organized.", "YWBTA\n\nYou are a great parent for helping that young girl but he is your son and he can get in and out of any relationship he wants. I understand her family unit isn\u2019t the best but is hurting your relationship with your son worth it? He won\u2019t feel comfortable in his own home with his parents. Is there a way you can slow have her move out into other relatives in her family?", "YWBTA. Perhaps your son could have had a bit more finesse in how he broke up with his ex(he\u2019s young and they don\u2019t always think about that) but you have to remember he is in his home. Where he should feel the most comfortable and the safest to talk about how he feels. I appreciate you wanting to help this girl but it can\u2019t be at the expense of your son. I would look into other safe options for this young girl if your house is no longer a great option for all. And make sure your son knows you love and accept him.", "I can understand your situation. When I was 16 my boyfriend's mom died, then his foster dad sucked big time, and my mom was gracious enough to let him move in with us. You're in a tough spot, and it's not wrong for you to care about this girl's wellbeing even though she's not your child. You sound like a very kind person. \n\nCan you please clarify if her mother is still alive? Or still has custody of her? Who's charge is she legally under? It's really difficult to give advice without this information. \n\nIf foster care is an option, then it's probably the best choice for her. It's not good for her to keep living with her ex, and it's not good for your son either. They are both losing in this situation. You can continue to support her from afar if you want by checking in with her, making sure she's properly fed and clothed, giving her a ride on occasion, et cetera. You can continue to be a stable adult in her life without housing her, and without putting your son in a difficult situation in his own home. NAH.", "YWBTA \n\nLook at this from your sons perspective, he'd obviously be upset because this looks like blatant homophobia (You've clarified differently in the comments I'm aware, it just comes off as clear bias).\n\n And really, it's not fair to punish him because your having his ex live with you, if everyone's still comfortable with her living there, maybe just get her a pair of noise cancelling headphones / earbuds to be honest.", "\u201cIf that weren\u2019t bad enough.\u201d\n\nYTA\u2026 Ur done, you have no right dictating ur sons love life.

How old are you that you think a teenager figuring out their identity is not important? As I said TWICE I applaud them giving her a place to stay, I just don't agree with their decision to tell their SON that he needs to put his feelings and hormones on hold because THEY decided to house his ex gf at 16. She can stay, they just shouldn't dictate who or what he does for HER comfort. Because in this scenario, giving her means taking away from him and that's exactly why this was a bad idea to begin with.

I understand the urge to help this girl, but you are essentially displacing your son in his own home to do it. He is allowed to date other people. He's a teenager. Asking him to take on the life burdens of a girlfriend at this age is too much. If you want to help her, seek out resources for her that don't involve making your son beholden to her.

You\u2019re not wrong for taking care of this girl but you are wrong for punishing your son for being queer because you want him to be with this girl who he doesn\u2019t want to be with.

You can still help this girl without the excuse of her being your son's girlfriend, and you can't repress his sexuality because you're feeling jilted somehow.

His journey doesn't get to trainwreck someone else like that. He should understand how that would feel if the roles were reversed. It's going to be a tough balance for both of them, and honestly I'm not sure how it all ends up.

Constantly driving drunk with me in the car, the utilities would be shut off, I worked at Target when I was 16 just to pay for groceries.

I actually hated him so much I wished he would die. He did have a medical emergency when I was 16 and I was seriously conflicted about calling an ambulance. I ended up saving him but while he was in the hospital I was so happy to be rid of him and was constantly hoping he would pass away which he almost did.  \n  \nMy mom was basically out of the picture and couldn't help because she was in a very poor financial place too and there wasn't room for me at her house, she lived with 3 of her siblings and her own parents they all took care of them.", "There was a response from OP and I already apologized in this very thread.", "Is there a timeframe for this girl going home, or going to live with extended family, or are you expecting your son to not date or express feelings for other people until he goes to college? \n\nBy \"did things\" are you implying that you have taken in a person who sexually assaulted your son and expecting him to be considerate of her feelings?", "Your son is 100% correct.", "Everything he said here is super fair YTA", "Well, this really is an awkward situation. On the one hand, when you break up with someone, it's painful to be around them. His ex girlfriend doesn't have a safe space in your home right now, and neither does your son. There's likely more to this than you know. Considering the home his ex came from, she's probably got some toxic or concerning behaviors. That doesn't mean she's to blame for the breakup. They're both really young and relationships at that age typically aren't long-term. But she's not your primary concern. It's not your responsibility to raise her. Your son is your responsibility. \n\nOn the flip side, she's in a distressing situation and sometimes we can't just cast people aside, even when we're \"done\" with them. This is a lesson your son has the opportunity to learn firsthand. But the first thing for you to decide is what kind of relationship you want with this girl going forward. If you want to continue taking care of her given her family situation,that's commendable. Find out if she's okay continuing to stay with you now that her relationship with your son is over. (Does she have extended family that can step in?) If you decide to take this on, can you facilitate some much needed therapy for her,so she can have a safe place to vent, not just about her breakup but her life in general? Sounds like she's had a very traumatic life and could use the extra support. Also, communicate with your son openly about these decisions, factoring in his needs also. Quite frankly, it's a lot to start dating someone else so soon after breaking up,which leads me to suspect that his crush has been on his mind for quite awhile. Kids these days (and always) have interior worlds and needs their parents have no clues about. I understand your feelings about your son's sexuality, but this is the safest time in his life to sort this out. He sounds bi to me, and that's okay. But this would be messy and awkward with his ex without that element. If she continues staying with you, then she's going to have to be okay with him moving on. Honestly, she might not want to stay, in spite of her own family's dysfunction. Or she might want to stay because your home is safer. But the adults in the room need to start adulting because this girl's needs are extreme, and this situation risks toying further with her needs for security. Separate the conversation about her well-being from the conversation about your son's new relationship. YWBTA for banning your son's romantic choice from the home, and this would be the case regardless of bisexuality. If it was a new girlfriend, it would still be wrong. But you're all in the soup together, so how to portion it out so everyone gets their needs met? It's not ideal, but life's like that sometimes. This kind of awkwardness and discomfort is part of it too. It doesn't have to be fatal. Maybe your son will act out his frustration by leaning into his attraction to his new crush. She will likely cry because her heart is broken. Is this all survivable? Yes, yes it is. And can your son learn some empathy along the way while she learns survival skills? Yes, yes it's possible, if you can model healthy behavior for them.", "But no, thats a leap, if you look at the sentence it doesn\u2019t state if that wasn\u2019t bad enough he has a new crush!\u201d NO they point out he is bi now stating that is bad and it gets worse from there", "Thats what i get out of that statement, how do you interpret the the literal words saying \u201cits not bad enough that he is bi\u201d the statement its not bad enough, literally means its bad he is bi and it gets worse", "But its how you said it, you could have said \u201cits not bad enough he broke up with her now he likes some one else\u201d and not even brought up his sexuality, but you chose to not only point it out, but literally call it bad.", "Reading comprehension isn't a strong suit of a lot of the posters here, you're fine.

I don't care the reason home life gets harder, necessarily. It's just that it does. In your case, it does. You're the parent, and aspects of your home life become less tolerable to you when a certain friend of your child's comes over. Easy as that.

Sure, the heart wants what it wants, but she\u2019s trapped now in a situation where she can\u2019t do anything but watch her recent partner fall in love with someone else before her eyes, or else become homeless. If he wasn\u2019t a teenager with the emotional maturity of a rock, I would even classify this behaviour as borderline abusive. \n\nHowever, the appropriate response is to parent your son and make him aware of what an ass he\u2019s being, not ban the boyfriend. Maybe he could go over to the crush\u2019s house, at least until the wound is less raw. You also need to decide what the plan is going forward - are you fostering this girl?

I understand the girl is in a difficult situation and taking her in is a kind gesture but there are other routes to take to provide her with support. This girl needs a stable home where she\u2019s prioritised and if she doesn\u2019t leave very soon your son probably won\u2019t want her there and in this instance you\u2019d need to make a choice, this is doubly bad as this could add to the girl\u2019s displacement issues. You should not be prioritising this girls feeling over your son and doing this probably won\u2019t end well.

While banning his boyfriend from the house would be wrong, providing she did not actually do anything to your son, he could be a little more empathetic. \n\nThe girl - if she DID 'do things' to your son, it is pretty awful of her to act all sad and broken.

It sounds like no matter what, her home life isn't a good environment at all so that should also be addressed. \n\nIn the end - you absolutely need to nail down what toxic things she did to him, because no matter what happened to her, you need to protect your son.

I don't know where you live or local laws, but in most places 16 is underage, and you could get in serious trouble for letting her stay with you if her legal guardians aren't aware or haven't given permission. It sounds like she has a really messed up home life, and it's commendable that you're so willing to help her, but I think she really needs more assistance than you're offering. You say it's only been two weeks, and there's a big difference between living with someone for two weeks vs. two years.\n\nHave her talk to her school guidance counselor or someone else she trusts, and reach out to social services. That may seem like the nuclear option, but letting her stay with you indefinitely, on an informal agreement, isn't the answer. How long are you going to help her? Until she's 18, or graduated? What about if she goes to college? How financially comfortable are you, to support her? Living with a high school ex-boyfriend's parents is not a good permanent solution for her. I'm sure you would never throw her out, but what guarantee does she have of that besides your word? She's only 16 and clearly needs help, and that's why you need to be the adult and get officials involved. She doesn't just need a roof over her head, she needs both financial and emotional support, and social services have a lot of resources to help her with that.\n\nAs for your son, he's also only a kid and should be able to talk about his social life in his own home. He didn't sign up to live with his ex, and he can break up with her whenever he wants. Again, it's very kind that you're trying to help this young woman but you can't just ignore all of your son's emotional needs because she's had it rough. He's your child, not her.

And whether or not she\u2019s actually toxic, your son should come first. The other thing about this situation is that you look like you\u2019re not going to support your son if he turns out he\u2019s gay or bisexual. So be careful with this situation.

Your generosity towards this girl is well intended, but banning your son's new romantic interest isn't going to make him suddenly come crawling back to this girl.

You could say to your son that you are happy for him and support him, but suggest that he is just mindful of her and her feelings. But at the end of the day, this is his home first and foremost.

A year and a half do not make someone long term partners. Teenagers fall in and out of love like the seasons. Sure, some high school sweethearts do make it to the altar, but most have multiple partners before then. \n\nAnd let\u2019s be real, how many 16 year-old boyfriend/girlfriends do you know that are cohabiting? Who thought THAT was a good idea, but I digress. \n\nOP says he \u201cdumped\u201d the girlfriend, sorry to say this, but that sounds like the sister who rescued a puppy instead of the mother whose son just pulled up the courage to come out of the closet and admit his deepest fear, fear of being rejected by his family and all of society. Not that he \u201cbroke up\u201d with her, not that he \u201cended the relationship,\u201d nope, he specifically \u201cdumped.\u201d  Isn\u2019t that a bit telling?\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry, I have to completely disagree with your statement that \u201che\u2019s gay/bi makes no difference,\u201d it is entirely relevant to this situation for a number of different reasons. First of which, the alleged dumping was not a spontaneous event, the OP\u2019s follow up posts regarding toxicity and abuse notwithstanding. No one wakes up one day and decides that today I\u2019ll become gay. The internal struggle is long and it\u2019s real. No one has the right to tell anyone when to come out of the closet, so there should be no expectation that the son should have spoken up with his objections to the OP moving the girlfriend in if he felt it threatened his closet. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s struggle or fear. \n\nAnd when that moment comes, whether by choice or happenstance, it comes. Maybe it was the new boyfriend, we don\u2019t know. But what we do know is this, the son HAS come out to his family. HIS home is supposed to be his safe place and he should be his parents priority in this deeply emotional and critical time in his life. These next few months are crucial in his future development. Not to downplay the GF\u2019s situation, but it sounds like she has been dealing with her challenges all of her life, how do the two situations compare on the developmental scale?\n\nAnd if he does have a loving family that cares for him, how can he speak freely with them in his own home about his feelings or, yee-gads, the boyfriend? What about the compassion and empathy for what is one of the most difficult, emotionally destructive experiences one can go through? Are you aware of the rates of suicide and homelessness among gay youth?\n\nWhere is respect and common decency for the emotional turmoil the son must surely be going through? Are you all really thinking that he deliberately planned to have his mom move his GF into their home as he struggled with his sexual identity crisis, only to have it all go south when the closet door got ripped off the hinges? No, just no.  At seventeen I sat on a bridge railing and contemplated the jump because I couldn\u2019t face my Catholic parents. I was twenty before I finally told my Mom, who just held me in her arms as we cried together. Can\u2019t imagine it at sixteen, but God bless him and give them all the strength they need to carry on. \n\nThis is on OP to resolve, but if she is any kind of a loving, caring mother, her FIRST priority needs to be to HER child. She\u2019s taken on an obligation that I no doubt was done out of mercy and love, and it is up to her to swiftly find other suitable arrangements with grace and dignity for everyone involved. That is true common decency. \n\nSorry OP, but your post sounds a little too defensive of GF and not nearly as supportive of what your own son is going thru.
