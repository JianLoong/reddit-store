I also stand by my comment. Maybe having the crush coming over right now is not the right thing as they navigate how to get things sorted in the household, but the fact that a 16 year old kid doesn't necessarily know how to navigate this isn't shocking and there needs to be some room for him to have privacy and conversations with his family about his crush.", "Whilst taking her in is very nice of you, you can't dictate who your son likes or who decides to be with. It's a complicated situation I wish you the est of luck figuring this out but don't alienate your son.", "INFO, was your son unhappy you allowed her to move in? Was he ever happy about it?", "YWBTA\n\nBelieve it or not, I was in a pretty similar situation to that girl once. At 15 I moved in with my boyfriend and his dad. We broke up, because teenage relationships rarely last long and definitely aren't built for living together. He brought home boys (I am female) he was dating. It sucked, but it was his house too. Why should he be punished for not tying himself to me forever? We were kids. Although for the record, the gender of his new crushes/relationships really didn't factor into how much it sucked.\n\nIt's commendable what you're doing for this girl, but she's not your son's responsibility. He needs to be allowed to live his life and explore his identity, and he needs to feel safe to be himself at home.", "YWBTA\n\nIt is great that you are helping this girl and are providing her a safe and stable home. That being said, it doesn\u2019t mean you can force your son to continue dating her. He is a teenager figuring things out and is entitled to do that in the safety of his own home.", "YTA. You're sort of forced into being some kind of asshole regardless - you can be TA to this teen girl you're caring for or you can be TA to your son. It sounds like you're currently filling a caregiver role for this girl and are doing your best to protect her, but in doing so you're putting her feelings about a breakup over your son's ability to live a normal life in his home. He's likely going to take this as you being unsupportive of his sexuality, even if that isn't what it is about. \n\nI think it's kind you're still letting her stay with you even though they are broken up, but I don't think it's reasonable to put limits on your son's new relationship to make his ex more comfortable since it doesn't sound like he had any say in that decision.", "The entire process of you semi-adopting your kid's teenage girlfriend is weird, but isn't really relevant except that she's a teenage girlfriend.\n\nYou are choosing to value that teenage girlfriend above your son, which is shitty. She isn't your kid, and while letting her stay with you is a nice thing, you cannot seriously think she's more likely to remain in your life than your son is. Even if she was your kid, your behavior would absolutely be treating her as the golden child and your son as an afterthought whose only purpose is serving, again, his teenage girlfriend. Trying to control his romantic relationships because you care more about his teenage ex will permanently break his trust in you and, justifiably, will probably lead to him thinking you're homophobic bigots. YTA.", "YWBTA imo. You\u2019re doing a really great thing for her by providing a safe place to live. However high school romances rarely last, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to your son to just bar the kid from the house. This would be a good teaching moment to teach your son about empathy and tact and to have respect for the turmoil that she is currently going through and to be mindful of other peoples feelings.", "YTA!!! Your son is 16, he\u2019s learning about himself, if he likes boys then he likes boys. By kicking his crush out of the house you\u2019re just showing YOUR OWN SON that he doesn\u2019t have a safe space in his house, because why girlfriend ok but boy crush isn\u2019t?", "Of course YWBTA. You don't have a right to dictate your son's love life, and just because you like this girl more doesn't mean your son has to put his life on hold to protect her. Telling your son he can't date someone of any gender because you want to spare his ex's feelings is just ridiculous.", "\"If that wasn't bad enough\"\n\nSTOP. STOP RIGHT THERE.\n\nYTA. I have nothing more to say. jfc.\n\nETA: OP made clear that they referred to the break up and not the boy. I apologized for assuming. It's in the comments. I made a judgment but have no problem recognizing I was in the wrong about the sentence.", "YTA. It was nice from you to take the poor girl in, BUT 1. Did you ask your son about it?\n2. Did you really expect them to stay together forever? At 16?\n3. Why did he consider her as \"horrible\"?\n4. Do you want to ruin your relationship with your son over this ex-girlfriend?\n5. Your \"bad enough\" statement sounds homophobic", "**YTA**\n\nWhile it was incredibly kind of you to take this girl into your home when her own home situation was untenable, it is incredibly inappropriate to interfere with your son's emotional and social life on her behalf unless he is directly and deliberately harming her (which he is not, and if he were your home wouldn't be a safe place for her anyway). \n\nFrankly, while you don't give your age, I find it worrisome that as an adult old enough to have a teenaged son of your own, you don't understand the difference between offering support and a reasonable parent/guardian relationship to this girl, and taking it upon yourself to orchestrate/manipulate relationships happening around her just to make her happy. The former is healthy and generous . . . the latter is DEEPLY problematic and unhealthy.\n\nIt is NOT YOUR SON'S RESPONSIBILITY TO LIMIT HIS OWN ROMANTIC LIFE TO PROTECT ANOTHER TEENAGER. It is not his responsibility to stay in a romantic relationship with her that he doesn't want (that's coercion, and abusive); it's not his responsibility to avoid living his life and having healthy social experiences and relationships because it might upset her.\n\nYOUR SON'S LIFE DOES NOT EXIST AS A COROLLARY TO THIS GIRL'S. He is an entire human being, deserving of autonomy and support from you, his parent, as he grows through adolescence, as much as she does.  In fact, as your own child, where there is any question, he should be your priority. \n\nYTA. This girl needs therapy, but so do you, because you clearly don't have any healthy or mature understanding of boundaries.", "YTA. As much sympathy as you have for this girl, she\u2019s your son\u2019s EX. And HE is YOUR SON. HE shouldn\u2019t be punished or restricted in his OWN HOME because his parents semi-adopted his ex girlfriend. You put him in an insanely uncomfortable and awkward situation and you\u2019re expecting him to put his life on hold and to accommodate for her because of a decision YOU made.", "YWBTA if you banned him. Will you ban your son from ever bringing someone home? If this new person was female, would that change your thoughts?\n\n\nHowever, I'd suggest having a chat with your son and advising he is at least sensitive to his ex's feelings whilst they're so recently broken up. Sounds like she could still use your support, but that also shouldn't mean your son isn't allowed a partner from this point forward.", "YTA. It's better she cries now and not when they're married and have kids.", "Info\n\nWho suggested she move in? Him or you?\n\nIf it wasn't him then it may have been he was already planning on ending the relationship and would you expect him to continue indefinitely?\n\nHow long do you plan for her to live with you and him not have someone round?  If short term then it's reasonable but not forever", "YWBTA. If I thought this was remotely true. And if hypothetically it was, I'd say you don't deserve your son.", "INFO: Were you aware that your son is bisexual? It seems odd that they would be together for so long and then he just dumps her. It feels like there are some details missing.", "YWBTA - Like, big time. Did you expect your son to marry this girl? He's 16 for god's sake. You're doing a nice thing for this girl, but she is NOT your child. Your SON is and you should be focusing on helping him grow up and find himself, whether that is as a gay individual or a straight one. It is not your choice. And telling your son that he can't see this boy that he likes? All he is going to do is see him without your knowledge, because teens gonna teen.", "INFO\n\nWhat did your son say to you as she was moving in? Did he ask for it? Was he okay with it? Because if he was, it\u2019s an asshole move on his part to do this after agreeing to her moving in. \n\nI feel like if he was dating another girl, some of the replies in here would be different. Obviously teen romances usually don\u2019t last, but 16 years old is old enough to understand tact.", "ESH. \n\nWhile you had the best intentions, now that their relationship ended you should be prioritising getting this girl a different home. There\u2019s no other solution here. \n\nWhile your son is factually right and his feelings about his home/new relationship/the breakup are valid, his behaviour is very callous and he could learn some empathy while his ex is still, temporarily, under your roof. \n\nWhile the ex girlfriend\u2019s hurt feelings are valid, and I feel very sorry for her, there\u2019s no way she can expect to stay with you and not witness her ex having other relationships that include home visits.", "You need to extricate yourself from your sons love life entirely.  It doesn\u2019t matter who your son has a crush on, your job now is to provide a welcoming space for whoever your son brings home and, if possible, a safe space for a child who might be crying about a breakup because she thinks it will make her homeless.  The only thing harder than 16 is stewardship of a 16 year old, Godspeed.", "YTA. You're very kind and compassionate toward this girl and that's a positive trait, but your son comes first in your life. You never should have taken her in. \n\nYou weren't thinking. Social services HAS to be involved with a minor under the age of 18. Have you called them? If not, you're breaking the law (in the US) and will be accountable for anything that might happen to her while in your care. If she gets seriously hurt, you could go to jail. \n\nYou cannot provide a home for a minor child who is not yours unless you're a qualified foster parent who has been vetted. \n\nAnd again, your son comes first, last, and always.", "YTA. You moved your sons girlfriend into the house without even consulting with him first about whether he would be comfortable with that? And now that he\u2019s come out to you as gay, something that is incredibly scary and vulnerable, and you\u2019re reacting by denying him and favoring his now ex girlfriend over him. That is beyond fucked up. How do you think that makes your son feel? I can tell you it almost certainly makes him feel rejected by you. You need to be finding a new place for ex girlfriend to live. And banning your sons boyfriend from coming over? Major AH move. All that\u2019s going to do is make your son resent you and think you don\u2019t accept his sexuality. Find the ex a new place to live and stop being such a homophobe.\n\nEdit to say how sad I feel for your son. He\u2019s a teenager going through an extremely turbulent time in his life and you\u2019ve put him in a position where now he can\u2019t talk openly about his feelings because you\u2019re favoring his ex over him. I mean dude, he\u2019s not gonna get back together with her, get over it. You can\u2019t guilt him into not being gay.", "YWBTA. Talk to your son about being more thoughtful and kind  towards her and give him a chance to improve. \n\nThis situation is really complicated and it sounds like she needs some external support. I don't think staying at her ex's house is a long term solution to the situation with her mom. Time to get her in with a school social worker or something to start getting her future more organized.", "YWBTA\n\nYou are a great parent for helping that young girl but he is your son and he can get in and out of any relationship he wants. I understand her family unit isn\u2019t the best but is hurting your relationship with your son worth it? He won\u2019t feel comfortable in his own home with his parents. Is there a way you can slow have her move out into other relatives in her family?", "YWBTA. Perhaps your son could have had a bit more finesse in how he broke up with his ex(he\u2019s young and they don\u2019t always think about that) but you have to remember he is in his home. Where he should feel the most comfortable and the safest to talk about how he feels. I appreciate you wanting to help this girl but it can\u2019t be at the expense of your son. I would look into other safe options for this young girl if your house is no longer a great option for all. And make sure your son knows you love and accept him.", "I can understand your situation. When I was 16 my boyfriend's mom died, then his foster dad sucked big time, and my mom was gracious enough to let him move in with us. You're in a tough spot, and it's not wrong for you to care about this girl's wellbeing even though she's not your child. You sound like a very kind person. \n\nCan you please clarify if her mother is still alive? Or still has custody of her? Who's charge is she legally under? It's really difficult to give advice without this information. \n\nIf foster care is an option, then it's probably the best choice for her. It's not good for her to keep living with her ex, and it's not good for your son either. They are both losing in this situation. You can continue to support her from afar if you want by checking in with her, making sure she's properly fed and clothed, giving her a ride on occasion, et cetera. You can continue to be a stable adult in her life without housing her, and without putting your son in a difficult situation in his own home. NAH.", "YWBTA \n\nLook at this from your sons perspective, he'd obviously be upset because this looks like blatant homophobia (You've clarified differently in the comments I'm aware, it just comes off as clear bias).\n\n And really, it's not fair to punish him because your having his ex live with you, if everyone's still comfortable with her living there, maybe just get her a pair of noise cancelling headphones / earbuds to be honest.", "\u201cIf that weren\u2019t bad enough.\u201d\n\nYTA\u2026 Ur done, you have no right dictating ur sons love life.

You've now made a very awkward situation. Your son, thank goodness,  still had the courage to stay true to himself and break up with her.\nBut, you have taken away his safe space. He no longer feels he can just be himself at home and talk about personal things. It's rare for a teenager to share feelings with parents, so you did a good job in making him feel loved and safe. \n\nDon't undo all that now.

How old are you that you think a teenager figuring out their identity is not important? As I said TWICE I applaud them giving her a place to stay, I just don't agree with their decision to tell their SON that he needs to put his feelings and hormones on hold because THEY decided to house his ex gf at 16. She can stay, they just shouldn't dictate who or what he does for HER comfort. Because in this scenario, giving her means taking away from him and that's exactly why this was a bad idea to begin with.

Asking him to take on the life burdens of a girlfriend at this age is too much. If you want to help her, seek out resources for her that don't involve making your son beholden to her.

You\u2019re not wrong for taking care of this girl but you are wrong for punishing your son for being queer because you want him to be with this girl who he doesn\u2019t want to be with.

This is the first time in this poor girl's life that she has a safe space and that's basically over with the current environment.

You can still help this girl without the excuse of her being your son's girlfriend, and you can't repress his sexuality because you're feeling jilted somehow.

They might suck, but they're still there. Ban this kid and your son will never forgive you for picking your \"new daughter\" over him.", "YWBTA. It's great you're allowing his ex to live in your house, but you don't get to interfere in your son's dating life for that reason.  She needs to understand he has the right to date other people, too.", "Sounds like you're trying to adopt this kid and replace your son lol you don't even care about his concerns that he was potentially abused. YTA", "YWBTA.  You should sit them both down separately and discuss the situation. You can't ban his bf because if she starts to date then you' have to ban her bringing anyone as well.  Talk to both about the reality of the situation and how best to go about respecting everyone's pwrsonal.choices and privacy.", "YWBTA and you shouldn\u2019t be having teenage bf/gf move in at all. Sounds like she has a bad enough homelife that CPS should have been involved.", "Ok I don't think you are getting great answers here. So let me lay it out as I see it.\n\nYWBTA for an outright ban. It's not going to help anything and just cause him to resent the girl.\n\nHOWEVER, that does not mean your son doesn't need to learn some decorum and respect the feelings of the other person. His journey doesn't get to trainwreck someone else like that. He should understand how that would feel if the roles were reversed. It's going to be a tough balance for both of them, and honestly I'm not sure how it all ends up. But there needs to be an understanding that his actions of being excited in a new relationship are very understandable, but don't trump her feelings of being dumped and that he needs to be respectful of her, especially as long as she is living in the same house.", "YTA.  I get that you wanted to help the girl, but you know teen relationships dont usually last very long.  Now your son is in a situation where he does not get to be himself in his home because you moved in his classmate. \n\n If you wanted to adopt her that is ok, but you should really have thought about what would happen when they broke up BEFORE you moved her in.  \n\nNow you put yourself in a tough spot where either you are on your sons side, like a good parent, or you are on the side of the neighbor girl you moved in.", ">My son...said he likes boys. If that wasn't bad enough,\n\nStop right there. Do not pass go, do not continue to speak. You can support your son's ex if you like, you can let her keep living with you, but you are judging him for being gay and for exiting a relationship that he was no longer happy in. Would you prefer that he continued to \"date\" her, while secretly pursuing boys at the same time? That would be more harmful to her than this. \n\nI get that you're in a hard place with this girl that you obviously consider to be family, but if you punish your son for no longer being in a relationship with her (and that's what you're doing if you try to softban him from dating by refusing to let him have his partners over at his own house) then YTA.", "INFO did your son want her to move in and know it would be for an extended period of time?", "YWBTA\n\nJust talk with him about respecting the fact that God ex is living with you. Also see if he is okay with her living with you. Even adults have trouble living with their exes.", "OP, I\u2019m wondering if your son isn\u2019t acting out because he wishes the gf hadn\u2019t moved in? Or in attempt to push her out/make her leave because he decided he doesn\u2019t want her there? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t focus on the boy crush issue right now as you have bigger problems. The focus should be on teaching your son how to be kind when he ends a relationship and figuring out what is next for this poor girl. Make sure your son knows that\u2019s it\u2019s not wrong to end a relationship but that cruelty will not be tolerated. Assure him that he is your main priority as your son, but that you committed to helping this young woman so it\u2019s not a situation that can be reversed immediately. Assure him you don\u2019t expect him to continue the relationship but make it clear he is also partially responsible for the decision to move her in. \n\nTell your son that his crush can come over when he learns to treat his ex with respect, not cruelty.", "YWBTA but your son does suck quite a bit here. He\u2019s not beholden to her forever, he\u2019s figuring stuff out, but he could have some empathy. This is a lot for his ex girlfriend to deal with. I think you need to work on getting her rehomed and in the meantime try to tell your son to exert some basic sense of being a good person for five minutes. He can be all over this boyfriend outside his home while you work on getting her to a better home.", "No judgment but there is a compromise. I think telling your son his boyfriend cannot come over for a month or so is very reasonable. Just to give her some time. She can use this time to prepare herself for what is next.", "YWBTA if this ban is more than a temporary thing.\n\nYour desire to help a girl in crisis is admirable, but she isn't your child.\n\nMeanwhile, your child is acting pretty callous given the situation.  I suspect he didn't really care for her the same way she did for him.\n\nHis abandonment of her is sad, It's no doubt hurtful to her and I totally understand your empathy for her situation.\n\nYou need to talk to your son about the situation outside of the home.  Teaching him to have empathy for her, to understand the complexities of the situation is important.  Hopefully he will slow his roll a bit with the new guy, at least around her.  \n\nYet realistic expectations should be considered as he's 16.  Expecting him to handle this like an adult is probably a stretch.  Showing her some deference though is reasonable. You should make your expectations clear to him.  You should also convey your support of him and work to find a compromise.\n\nMost importantly you need to figure out short and long term plans regarding this girl, and need to communicate with her about the situation.  Her living there, and with the breakup.  I cannot imagine what's going on in her mind right now.  She needs safety and stability.  You can provide the latter by figuring things out and talking with her.  Social services may need to be involved.\nAs it sounds like she had an unfit home before.\n\nGood luck OP.\n\nGood luck OP.", "I feel so bad for the girl man. That\u2019s gonna scar her for like but it\u2019s not your or your son\u2019s responsibility.

Your son is kind of being a jerk but he's young and romantic feelings are extremely difficult to navigate. Even for very mature people. He is feeling things on an exaggerated level right now and banning this new love interest will amplify those feelings by quite a bit. It will also position you as a rival in his mind and that will make it much harder for you to provide guidance. I would encourage you to have a heart to hear with him. Make sure he is empathetic to this poor girl's feelings and help him learn how to navigate these feelings and arrangements in a way that will serve him for the rest of his life. You're in a tough spot but you're obviously looking for the path forward that causes the least harm. If you can teach your son to approach things in the same way you will not only not be an asshole, but you will be a great parent.", "YWBTA\n\nHave a discussion with your son about tact. Obviously talking about his new crush and bringing him over directly after he dumped this girl is not the best way to handle the situation. However, you can't expect your son to not discuss his crushes or have boyfriends forever.\n\nI think it's fine to say that you would prefer the son to have his dates outside the house for a little while so the girl has some time to process what is happening. But a flat ban isn't the right solution.\n\nI also recommend you talk to the girl about her feelings and about her future in the house. Are you planning to house her indefinitely? Because she might be afraid that the bf moving on means she's just lost her housing.\n\nEdit: After reading your comments, I'm a little concerned about your son. Is he okay having this girl continue living with you? How has she been \"toxic\" towards him? What \"things\" has she done?", "ESH \n\nYou\u2019re son could be more mindful of her feelings but banning this other boy from the house just because his ex isn\u2019t over them is going a bit far. Having a talk with your son about the situation could help more than banning the boy from your house.", "YWBTA. I do think this is a really valuable moment to talk to your son about respect, respecting his ex, not putting salt in the wound, but I'm not sure banning his new person is the right move.", "NTA, I  would suggest having a talk with both of them. Your son needs to show a little empathy. She also needs to understand that your son is moving on and she needs to process her feelings. It wouldn't be a bad idea to ban him for a little while.", "YWBA \n\nThis is why you shouldn't be moving 2 teens in together. That is so much pressure to put on 2 very young people who are dating and likely won't marry. Its forcing something there that may not be there like in this case. Now that your son has come out, he wants to explore, and has every right to, but he has to tiptoe around his now exes feelings both inside his home and outside. Where is your own child's place of comfort now?\n\nHeartache sucks, but that's completely unfair to ban your sons new bf interest from the home because of his ex gf's hurt feelings. This is all apart of relationships and growing up, the only difference is that it is now way more messy and complicated, its as if they're a married couple divorcing and have to deal with each other until one of them can find their own place. That's too much for teens, and you maybe shouldn't have put that on your son.", "I think it would be better to focus on supporting the girl and letting her know her feelings are valid. Maybe offer her some girl\u2019s nights out so she can get away from it and talk to you about how she\u2019s doing. But it\u2019s also fine if the son is moving onto a new relationship, and excited about a new partner. I don\u2019t think you should ask him to downplay his own happiness even if you mention to him that his ex is going through a rough patch, so it\u2019s probably best to give her some space and be conscientious of her grief.

You need to get them some therapy. And you need to have some adult conversations with both kids. Maybe 75% as peers and 25% as the authority of the house. Some rules need to be put in place that show respect for each person, and some boundaries and options need to be created so that new partners can come over and visit without other people feeling shitty. \n\nBut banning somebody outright is a tiny bandaid solution at best.

I actually hated him so much I wished he would die. He did have a medical emergency when I was 16 and I was seriously conflicted about calling an ambulance. I ended up saving him but while he was in the hospital I was so happy to be rid of him and was constantly hoping he would pass away which he almost did.  \n  \nMy mom was basically out of the picture and couldn't help because she was in a very poor financial place too and there wasn't room for me at her house, she lived with 3 of her siblings and her own parents they all took care of them.", "There was a response from OP and I already apologized in this very thread.", "Is there a timeframe for this girl going home, or going to live with extended family, or are you expecting your son to not date or express feelings for other people until he goes to college? \n\nBy \"did things\" are you implying that you have taken in a person who sexually assaulted your son and expecting him to be considerate of her feelings?", "Your son is 100% correct.", "Everything he said here is super fair YTA", "Well, this really is an awkward situation. On the one hand, when you break up with someone, it's painful to be around them. His ex girlfriend doesn't have a safe space in your home right now, and neither does your son. There's likely more to this than you know. Considering the home his ex came from, she's probably got some toxic or concerning behaviors. That doesn't mean she's to blame for the breakup. They're both really young and relationships at that age typically aren't long-term. But she's not your primary concern. It's not your responsibility to raise her. Your son is your responsibility. \n\nOn the flip side, she's in a distressing situation and sometimes we can't just cast people aside, even when we're \"done\" with them. This is a lesson your son has the opportunity to learn firsthand. But the first thing for you to decide is what kind of relationship you want with this girl going forward. If you want to continue taking care of her given her family situation,that's commendable. Find out if she's okay continuing to stay with you now that her relationship with your son is over. (Does she have extended family that can step in?) If you decide to take this on, can you facilitate some much needed therapy for her,so she can have a safe place to vent, not just about her breakup but her life in general? Sounds like she's had a very traumatic life and could use the extra support. Also, communicate with your son openly about these decisions, factoring in his needs also. Quite frankly, it's a lot to start dating someone else so soon after breaking up,which leads me to suspect that his crush has been on his mind for quite awhile. Kids these days (and always) have interior worlds and needs their parents have no clues about. I understand your feelings about your son's sexuality, but this is the safest time in his life to sort this out. He sounds bi to me, and that's okay. But this would be messy and awkward with his ex without that element. If she continues staying with you, then she's going to have to be okay with him moving on. Honestly, she might not want to stay, in spite of her own family's dysfunction. Or she might want to stay because your home is safer. But the adults in the room need to start adulting because this girl's needs are extreme, and this situation risks toying further with her needs for security. Separate the conversation about her well-being from the conversation about your son's new relationship. YWBTA for banning your son's romantic choice from the home, and this would be the case regardless of bisexuality. If it was a new girlfriend, it would still be wrong. But you're all in the soup together, so how to portion it out so everyone gets their needs met? It's not ideal, but life's like that sometimes. This kind of awkwardness and discomfort is part of it too. It doesn't have to be fatal. Maybe your son will act out his frustration by leaning into his attraction to his new crush. She will likely cry because her heart is broken. Is this all survivable? Yes, yes it is. And can your son learn some empathy along the way while she learns survival skills? Yes, yes it's possible, if you can model healthy behavior for them.", "But no, thats a leap, if you look at the sentence it doesn\u2019t state if that wasn\u2019t bad enough he has a new crush!\u201d NO they point out he is bi now stating that is bad and it gets worse from there", "Thats what i get out of that statement, how do you interpret the the literal words saying \u201cits not bad enough that he is bi\u201d the statement its not bad enough, literally means its bad he is bi and it gets worse", "But its how you said it, you could have said \u201cits not bad enough he broke up with her now he likes some one else\u201d and not even brought up his sexuality, but you chose to not only point it out, but literally call it bad.", "Reading comprehension isn't a strong suit of a lot of the posters here, you're fine. You'll get attacked by some loons just because your sentence wasn't structured the way they would have were they in your shoes which is ridiculous.", "So should he just never bring any guys home for the rest of the time they live together?

It's his home, you're already forcing your kid to live with his ex who he's told you is toxic, and you won't listen to the *deeply concerning* statement that she \"did things\" to him.\n\nYou are making it very obvious you like the ex more than your own kid.", "if part of the problem is just him talking about how much he likes this kid, banning him from the house won't actually solve it", ">We talked to him about her moving in and he's saying she's terrible, toxic, \u201cdid things \u201d to him (whatever that means)\n\nStep 1 needs to be figuring out what that means.

The \"doing things\" in my case were that she was sad after the breakup, which the other partner decided was homophobia. I'm not trying to overlook what possibly could have happened to OP's son, who needs to be her top priority, but I hesitate to throw all the blame at the feet of a 16 year old with nowhere to go and call her abusive without more information.", "That does actually make a difference.

I think he's going about it wrong but he's trying to explain to his son that sometimes there's a time and a place and tact with how you do something and how you move on from a relationship when you ex is around.  Especially when your ex is dealing with some recent serious trauma.  \n\nFor example, I understand that my roommate has a new girl, but maybe he shouldn't be banging her in the room that shares a wall with a girl he just broke up with yesterday- kind of thing.", "And yet according to OP the fact that the son has made these claims doesn't change anything about the situation.\n\nLots of teenagers don't have the vocabulary or experience to articulate when they have been abused (or even necessarily to understand that certain behaviours are abusive).

He's saying she \"did things\" to him is really indicating some form of abuse, especially if he's not wanting to talk about it in detail he's embarrassed or uncomfortable. I very much emphasize she needs therapy because she was raised with abusive love as a child that might be how she thinks you're supposed to behave with other people. As far as him saying she shouldn't be listening to his conversations remind him that he knew she could hear it and that her toxic behavior doesn't excuse his toxic behavior. He might be trying to drive her out and it sounds like there is a reason.", "Hmmm. Complicated. Because it seems a bit cruel to dump her during this time and to bring around someone new so quickly like this wasn't a year and a long term relationship with someone that mattered to him who is now living under the same roof. \n\nBut at the same time, you didn't ban his last partner, you shouldn't ban this one. I understand that it puts you and especially her in a difficult situation, but banning his bf is only gonna stir up more shit in the house. Maybe just talk to your son and tell him she needs more time before you come parading around your new person. Not so much a ban, just a reminder to be considerate.", "YTA for dismissing what your son is trying to tell you about what she did to him. YTA for moving her in against your sons wishes. YWBTA if you now ban his new boyfriend from the house.", "NAH-   \n\n\nYou're allowed to keep whoever you want out of your own home, speaking as a father with a home to manage with my wife.  \n\n\nIf one of my children had a friend who made my entire life harder when they came over, that friend would not be welcome at my home. I don't care the reason home life gets harder, necessarily. It's just that it does. In your case, it does. You're the parent, and aspects of your home life become less tolerable to you when a certain friend of your child's comes over. Easy as that. Sorry that children didn't ask to get born (boy this comes up on reddit a lot with parents involved, so I'm preempting it), but that doesn't mean you get a say in how the house gets run all the time.  \n\n\nNow, your real problem is more or less one that you created. Inviting this girl to stay in your home.   \n\n\nThe only way any of my kids friends or significant others will ever be staying in my home while they are minors is if custody has been removed from their actual parents, and I have agreed and gone through the legal procedures to foster/adopt them until they are no longer a minor or that their parent(s) become legally allowed to have their child back. Period. End.  \n\n\nDoing anything else ***has a higher than acceptable probability***  of turning out badly. Lots of people are going through hard times. Lots of people I know are going through hard times. Lots of people I pass on the street are going through hard times. I can't invite them all to stay with me until it gets better. I don't have the resources. Not financially. Not emotionally. Not mentally.  \n\n\nI'm not saying you're an AH for inviting her in. Sounds like you were trying to do the right thing. But I am saying that you need to begin to find a way to move this girl into a more stable living situation that does not involve your home.", "Holy wow YTA. If you don\u2019t think this will effect your relationship with your son, you better hold onto your seat. You\u2019re choosing his ex-gf over your own son. You\u2019d rather worry about her feelings than care about your sons. Instead of quoting that she is toxic, maybe take the time to actually talk to your son and figure out a plan of some sort. It was a nice gesture for you to allow her to stay but your son should absolutely not have to walk on eggshells in his own home because his father is more concerned about an ex that didn\u2019t treat him right. \n\nI hope you realize the damage this will cause between you and your son.", "I\u2019m going ESH. Your son is a teenager who clearly doesn\u2019t have the emotional maturity to navigate this situation, and it\u2019s a real dick move to flaunt this new relationship in front of his ex who I\u2019d wager already has a few abandonment issues. Sure, the heart wants what it wants, but she\u2019s trapped now in a situation where she can\u2019t do anything but watch her recent partner fall in love with someone else before her eyes, or else become homeless. If he wasn\u2019t a teenager with the emotional maturity of a rock, I would even classify this behaviour as borderline abusive. \n\nHowever, the appropriate response is to parent your son and make him aware of what an ass he\u2019s being, not ban the boyfriend. Maybe he could go over to the crush\u2019s house, at least until the wound is less raw. You also need to decide what the plan is going forward - are you fostering this girl? How are you going to reassure her that she won\u2019t be made homeless or sent back to her abusive former home just because her ex is a fickle teen?", "YTA, I think you crossed some major boundaries by allowing this girl to stay with you as now limitations have been put on your son and his life and what he can talk about within his own home. 16 year olds don\u2019t often know what they need or want and this stressful dynamic could cause resentment if he doesn\u2019t feel free to express himself in normal ways under his own roof. I understand the girl is in a difficult situation and taking her in is a kind gesture but there are other routes to take to provide her with support. This girl needs a stable home where she\u2019s prioritised and if she doesn\u2019t leave very soon your son probably won\u2019t want her there and in this instance you\u2019d need to make a choice, this is doubly bad as this could add to the girl\u2019s displacement issues. You should not be prioritising this girls feeling over your son and doing this probably won\u2019t end well. Whole bag of wrongness here in my eyes.\n\nEDIT: after further reading that gf treated son badly also, my point feels reinforced. Not appropriate to have her there.", "I would say ESH (tentatively).\n\nFirst of all, you - while what you did for this girl is commendable. But he says she is toxic and did things to him and you just... let that go? Don't press for more information? I mean, this girl is living in your home, and you don't wonder what she did to your son?\n\nYour son - Depending on the toxic/she did things comments - your son may be just trying to 'get back' at her by rubbing his new relationship in her face. Or, he could just lack empathy. Or, he could just be a teenager and it being an issue just isn't registering with him. No matter what, it should be addressed. While banning his boyfriend from the house would be wrong, providing she did not actually do anything to your son, he could be a little more empathetic. \n\nThe girl - if she DID 'do things' to your son, it is pretty awful of her to act all sad and broken. If she didn't do anything and he is just being a jerk, then she has no fault here. It sounds like no matter what, her home life isn't a good environment at all so that should also be addressed. \n\nIn the end - you absolutely need to nail down what toxic things she did to him, because no matter what happened to her, you need to protect your son. He could be telling tall tales to get her out of there, or he could be lashing out because she DID do stuff to him. FIND OUT!", "YTA. Wouldn\u2019t it be even worse for him to string her along and break her heart later? You\u2019re just delaying the inevitable. You chose to take her in, knowing kids change their minds about stuff.
