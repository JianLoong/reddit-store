It's a complicated situation I wish you the est of luck figuring this out but don't alienate your son.", "INFO, was your son unhappy you allowed her to move in? Was he ever happy about it?", "YWBTA\n\nBelieve it or not, I was in a pretty similar situation to that girl once. At 15 I moved in with my boyfriend and his dad. We broke up, because teenage relationships rarely last long and definitely aren't built for living together. He brought home boys (I am female) he was dating. It sucked, but it was his house too. Why should he be punished for not tying himself to me forever? We were kids. Although for the record, the gender of his new crushes/relationships really didn't factor into how much it sucked.\n\nIt's commendable what you're doing for this girl, but she's not your son's responsibility. He needs to be allowed to live his life and explore his identity, and he needs to feel safe to be himself at home.", "YWBTA\n\nIt is great that you are helping this girl and are providing her a safe and stable home. That being said, it doesn\u2019t mean you can force your son to continue dating her. He is a teenager figuring things out and is entitled to do that in the safety of his own home.", "YTA. You're sort of forced into being some kind of asshole regardless - you can be TA to this teen girl you're caring for or you can be TA to your son. It sounds like you're currently filling a caregiver role for this girl and are doing your best to protect her, but in doing so you're putting her feelings about a breakup over your son's ability to live a normal life in his home. He's likely going to take this as you being unsupportive of his sexuality, even if that isn't what it is about. \n\nI think it's kind you're still letting her stay with you even though they are broken up, but I don't think it's reasonable to put limits on your son's new relationship to make his ex more comfortable since it doesn't sound like he had any say in that decision.", "The entire process of you semi-adopting your kid's teenage girlfriend is weird, but isn't really relevant except that she's a teenage girlfriend.\n\nYou are choosing to value that teenage girlfriend above your son, which is shitty. She isn't your kid, and while letting her stay with you is a nice thing, you cannot seriously think she's more likely to remain in your life than your son is. Even if she was your kid, your behavior would absolutely be treating her as the golden child and your son as an afterthought whose only purpose is serving, again, his teenage girlfriend. Trying to control his romantic relationships because you care more about his teenage ex will permanently break his trust in you and, justifiably, will probably lead to him thinking you're homophobic bigots. YTA.", "YWBTA imo. You\u2019re doing a really great thing for her by providing a safe place to live. However high school romances rarely last, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to your son to just bar the kid from the house. This would be a good teaching moment to teach your son about empathy and tact and to have respect for the turmoil that she is currently going through and to be mindful of other peoples feelings.", "YTA!!! Your son is 16, he\u2019s learning about himself, if he likes boys then he likes boys. By kicking his crush out of the house you\u2019re just showing YOUR OWN SON that he doesn\u2019t have a safe space in his house, because why girlfriend ok but boy crush isn\u2019t?", "Of course YWBTA. You don't have a right to dictate your son's love life, and just because you like this girl more doesn't mean your son has to put his life on hold to protect her. Telling your son he can't date someone of any gender because you want to spare his ex's feelings is just ridiculous.", "\"If that wasn't bad enough\"\n\nSTOP. STOP RIGHT THERE.\n\nYTA. I have nothing more to say. jfc.", "YTA. It was nice from you to take the poor girl in, BUT 1. Did you ask your son about it?\n2. Did you really expect them to stay together forever? At 16?\n3. Why did he consider her as \"horrible\"?\n4. Do you want to ruin your relationship with your son over this ex-girlfriend?\n5. Your \"bad enough\" statement sounds homophobic", "**YTA**\n\nWhile it was incredibly kind of you to take this girl into your home when her own home situation was untenable, it is incredibly inappropriate to interfere with your son's emotional and social life on her behalf unless he is directly and deliberately harming her (which he is not, and if he were your home wouldn't be a safe place for her anyway). \n\nFrankly, while you don't give your age, I find it worrisome that as an adult old enough to have a teenaged son of your own, you don't understand the difference between offering support and a reasonable parent/guardian relationship to this girl, and taking it upon yourself to orchestrate/manipulate relationships happening around her just to make her happy. The former is healthy and generous . . . the latter is DEEPLY problematic and unhealthy.\n\nIt is NOT YOUR SON'S RESPONSIBILITY TO LIMIT HIS OWN ROMANTIC LIFE TO PROTECT ANOTHER TEENAGER. It is not his responsibility to stay in a romantic relationship with her that he doesn't want (that's coercion, and abusive); it's not his responsibility to avoid living his life and having healthy social experiences and relationships because it might upset her.\n\nYOUR SON'S LIFE DOES NOT EXIST AS A COROLLARY TO THIS GIRL'S. He is an entire human being, deserving of autonomy and support from you, his parent, as he grows through adolescence, as much as she does.  In fact, as your own child, where there is any question, he should be your priority. \n\nYTA. This girl needs therapy, but so do you, because you clearly don't have any healthy or mature understanding of boundaries.", "YTA. As much sympathy as you have for this girl, she\u2019s your son\u2019s EX. And HE is YOUR SON. HE shouldn\u2019t be punished or restricted in his OWN HOME because his parents semi-adopted his ex girlfriend. You put him in an insanely uncomfortable and awkward situation and you\u2019re expecting him to put his life on hold and to accommodate for her because of a decision YOU made.", "YWBTA if you banned him. Will you ban your son from ever bringing someone home? If this new person was female, would that change your thoughts?\n\n\nHowever, I'd suggest having a chat with your son and advising he is at least sensitive to his ex's feelings whilst they're so recently broken up. Sounds like she could still use your support, but that also shouldn't mean your son isn't allowed a partner from this point forward.", "YTA. It's better she cries now and not when they're married and have kids.", "Info\n\nWho suggested she move in? Him or you?\n\nIf it wasn't him then it may have been he was already planning on ending the relationship and would you expect him to continue indefinitely?\n\nHow long do you plan for her to live with you and him not have someone round?  If short term then it's reasonable but not forever", "YWBTA. If I thought this was remotely true. And if hypothetically it was, I'd say you don't deserve your son.", "INFO: Were you aware that your son is bisexual? It seems odd that they would be together for so long and then he just dumps her. It feels like there are some details missing.", "YWBTA - Like, big time. Did you expect your son to marry this girl? He's 16 for god's sake. You're doing a nice thing for this girl, but she is NOT your child. Your SON is and you should be focusing on helping him grow up and find himself, whether that is as a gay individual or a straight one. It is not your choice. And telling your son that he can't see this boy that he likes? All he is going to do is see him without your knowledge, because teens gonna teen.", "INFO\n\nWhat did your son say to you as she was moving in? Did he ask for it? Was he okay with it? Because if he was, it\u2019s an asshole move on his part to do this after agreeing to her moving in. \n\nI feel like if he was dating another girl, some of the replies in here would be different. Obviously teen romances usually don\u2019t last, but 16 years old is old enough to understand tact.", "ESH. \n\nWhile you had the best intentions, now that their relationship ended you should be prioritising getting this girl a different home. There\u2019s no other solution here. \n\nWhile your son is factually right and his feelings about his home/new relationship/the breakup are valid, his behaviour is very callous and he could learn some empathy while his ex is still, temporarily, under your roof. \n\nWhile the ex girlfriend\u2019s hurt feelings are valid, and I feel very sorry for her, there\u2019s no way she can expect to stay with you and not witness her ex having other relationships that include home visits.", "You need to extricate yourself from your sons love life entirely.  It doesn\u2019t matter who your son has a crush on, your job now is to provide a welcoming space for whoever your son brings home and, if possible, a safe space for a child who might be crying about a breakup because she thinks it will make her homeless.  The only thing harder than 16 is stewardship of a 16 year old, Godspeed.", "YTA. You're very kind and compassionate toward this girl and that's a positive trait, but your son comes first in your life. You never should have taken her in. \n\nYou weren't thinking. Social services HAS to be involved with a minor under the age of 18. Have you called them? If not, you're breaking the law (in the US) and will be accountable for anything that might happen to her while in your care. If she gets seriously hurt, you could go to jail. \n\nYou cannot provide a home for a minor child who is not yours unless you're a qualified foster parent who has been vetted. \n\nAnd again, your son comes first, last, and always.", "YTA. You moved your sons girlfriend into the house without even consulting with him first about whether he would be comfortable with that? And now that he\u2019s come out to you as gay, something that is incredibly scary and vulnerable, and you\u2019re reacting by denying him and favoring his now ex girlfriend over him. That is beyond fucked up. How do you think that makes your son feel? I can tell you it almost certainly makes him feel rejected by you. You need to be finding a new place for ex girlfriend to live. And banning your sons boyfriend from coming over? Major AH move. All that\u2019s going to do is make your son resent you and think you don\u2019t accept his sexuality. Find the ex a new place to live and stop being such a homophobe.\n\nEdit to say how sad I feel for your son. He\u2019s a teenager going through an extremely turbulent time in his life and you\u2019ve put him in a position where now he can\u2019t talk openly about his feelings because you\u2019re favoring his ex over him. I mean dude, he\u2019s not gonna get back together with her, get over it. You can\u2019t guilt him into not being gay.", "YWBTA. Talk to your son about being more thoughtful and kind  towards her and give him a chance to improve. \n\nThis situation is really complicated and it sounds like she needs some external support. I don't think staying at her ex's house is a long term solution to the situation with her mom. Time to get her in with a school social worker or something to start getting her future more organized.", "YWBTA\n\nYou are a great parent for helping that young girl but he is your son and he can get in and out of any relationship he wants. I understand her family unit isn\u2019t the best but is hurting your relationship with your son worth it? He won\u2019t feel comfortable in his own home with his parents. Is there a way you can slow have her move out into other relatives in her family?", "YWBTA. Perhaps your son could have had a bit more finesse in how he broke up with his ex(he\u2019s young and they don\u2019t always think about that) but you have to remember he is in his home. Where he should feel the most comfortable and the safest to talk about how he feels. I appreciate you wanting to help this girl but it can\u2019t be at the expense of your son. I would look into other safe options for this young girl if your house is no longer a great option for all. And make sure your son knows you love and accept him.", "I can understand your situation. When I was 16 my boyfriend's mom died, then his foster dad sucked big time, and my mom was gracious enough to let him move in with us. You're in a tough spot, and it's not wrong for you to care about this girl's wellbeing even though she's not your child. You sound like a very kind person. \n\nCan you please clarify if her mother is still alive? Or still has custody of her? Who's charge is she legally under? It's really difficult to give advice without this information. \n\nIf foster care is an option, then it's probably the best choice for her. It's not good for her to keep living with her ex, and it's not good for your son either. They are both losing in this situation. You can continue to support her from afar if you want by checking in with her, making sure she's properly fed and clothed, giving her a ride on occasion, et cetera. You can continue to be a stable adult in her life without housing her, and without putting your son in a difficult situation in his own home. NAH.", "YWBTA \n\nLook at this from your sons perspective, he'd obviously be upset because this looks like blatant homophobia (You've clarified differently in the comments I'm aware, it just comes off as clear bias).\n\n And really, it's not fair to punish him because your having his ex live with you, if everyone's still comfortable with her living there, maybe just get her a pair of noise cancelling headphones / earbuds to be honest.", "\u201cIf that weren\u2019t bad enough.\u201d\n\nYTA\u2026 Ur done, you have no right dictating ur sons love life.

To move on. Then your son gets his life back.", "YWBTA\n\nI agree with the people saying to have a conversation with your son about being courteous.

I really don't think this is an asshole situation.", "Your son's an AH for having 0 tact, you don't move a GF in then dump her and instantly start dating/bring a new person into the same house.. that's extremely rude and meanspirited.

He'd be behaving poorly if he showed his boyfriend to her at school on purpose or whatever, let alone purposely bringing him home in the room next to hers.\n\nThe girl is in pain and, by the looks of it, in a terrible situation not caused by your son (I mean, we all had our hearts broken and not all heartbreakers behave well - we get over it. I'm referring to the girl's family). While I'm not a parent, I believe you could use this situation to teach your son a lession of kindness and empathy and ask him a small sacrifice for the time that this girl will stay at your place.

You've now made a very awkward situation. Your son, thank goodness,  still had the courage to stay true to himself and break up with her.\nBut, you have taken away his safe space. He no longer feels he can just be himself at home and talk about personal things. It's rare for a teenager to share feelings with parents, so you did a good job in making him feel loved and safe. \n\nDon't undo all that now. This is something that can tear your family apart, with your son shutting down, feeling rejected and leaving home early.\n\nThis help for the girl was ill-judged in not sorting out a proper long term solution.  Sure, it's nice to feel that you've rescued someone from a bad situation but in doing so you've raised unrealistic expectation on her side. This CANNOT be her forever home. Start doing some research and find organisations that specialise in helping teens in her situation that have group homes, mental health support,  etc.  Contact social services and speak to them.

It's not healthy for anyone else, parents or internet stranger imposing what sexuality they think someone else is.\n\nSource: I'm pan and didn't fully realise until I was in my 20s, had people trying to tell me what I was and it just fucked with my head.", "Yes, you're missing context. Lots of gay people think they're straight until they realize that they aren't. You don't know the son or if he still likes girls just because he dated one in the past. \n\nHe could be bi but only he would know.", "Sexual attraction is fluid, he thought he liked girls last year, he thinks he likes boys this year. Just because he previously was attracted to women doesn't mean he still is.", "From what I understand part of the reason for break up, other than her being a \u201cterrible\u201d girlfriend, he's not sure he likes women", "So they should have left the girl in an abusive situation or send her back? I agree that banning the new boy isn't the right response, but trying to be kind to a girl in crisis and teaching their son to be empathetic to an ex doesn't make OP an AH and stubbornly hurting someone when some tact could avoid it doesn't make the son intelligent.", "The son says he doesn't like her and that she was a terrible girlfriend", "It\u2019s not his job to be sensitive around an ex! In a normal situation hopefully she wouldn\u2019t be right there all the time. You\u2019re assuming it was a family decision and to have her move in. Honestly to me, it sounds like the parents want a straight son and having the \u201cnice girl\u201d right there and available (including banning the new crush/maybe bf) will cure him.\n\nLike I agree we need an update on timeline and who initiated what. But youre making assumptions too, just giving the benefit of the doubt to compulsory heterosexuality.", "He didn\u2019t ask her to move in. His mommy invited her to move in.", "Then OP should go through the right channels to get her help. Has OP taken her to therapy, to see a counselor, to talk to anyone to deal with her trauma? Or is OP just focusing on the fact that the son broke up with her, and doing what she can to coddle the girl instead of getting her proper help? Cause that\u2019s what it seems like to me. \n\nWhat if she gets in an accident and needs serious medical attention? Does OP have this girls medical card, social security, the permissions to actually take the child for treatment? You can\u2019t just say \u201chey kids your life is shit, come live with me!\u201d and let them live with you because you *think* you can do better.", "A 16-year-old girl who's been abused by her parents her whole life is probably not going to be the ideal partner, true. That doesn't make this situation her fault.\n\nThe son, though, could take this as an opportunity to build some kindness. If, when he's older, he ends up living with a partner and they break up but can't immediately move out, this exact situation will provide him with the tools to navigate that one. \n\nThe solution in this case, though, isn't to ban the son's crush from the house. It's for OP to help the girl process this so she can bounce back emotionally, and to ask the son to simply be a bit more circumspect when his ex is in earshot.", "We don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s passed since the breakup. If the son can\u2019t be himself at home where else can he have a safe space? That\u2019ll literally push him away, he\u2019s 16 years old, that could make him cut contact with the family.", "So...how does he talk to his family about his life? His ex lives in their home. It's also his home. That's where his family lives. Where else is he supposed to go? \n\nAnd most importantly, why do you see it as lacking in empathy that he refuses to keep his sexuality and life on hold for this one girl who his parents decided to bring into their house? And I'm not saying the parents are in the wrong, because the child absolutely needed a place to stay, and they decided that place was their own. But that cannot in turn mean that erases his own life to accommodate her. \n\nIf he is supposed to be grown up enough to be more understanding, then so is she. And she can be seen as lacking empathy for his journey to discover his sexuality. But she's not being, she's a kid. Who just got her heart broken. And lives in a house not her own. And so I have empathy for her, but making the son not talk about his life because of it is not the way. All OP is doing is enforcing the idea that he is not important enough to his own parents, and that his sexuality is not either.", "Haha it happens.", "Wait, this massively changes things - what \"things\" did she do to him?", "Um... I think you should be taking these claims of her being toxic and \"doing things\" to your son a bit more seriously.\n\nSure, it could be teenage dramatics. Or you could be housing someone who abused your son.", "It sounds like you're choosing this girl over your son. Her situation is terrible but at the end of the day, your son should be able to live his life and have his relationships within his own home.", "you should probably find out some more detail on what your son means by these allegations. seems like you care more about intervening in this random girl's life than you care about your own son. \n\nespecially from your comments where you say that your son seemed hesitant about her moving in. i'm glad you are not my mother ffs...", "I can\u2019t see what your saying because your son is right if he says she\u2019s toxic you need to sit him down and ask why not ban his boyfriend from coming over because she can\u2019t comprehend that he has moved  on", "I may be mistaken  here but I got the impression  that your son  started  to  bring  his crush as a punishment  and message  to  his ex  when I first  read the post.\n\nGet him to a therapist  if he doesn't  want to talk  to you and see if  he talks to the therapist.  \n\nHave your own session to explain  your side /view of the problem  then wait for the therapist  advice.  \n\nIf it is something  really wrong  the therapist  should  help  indirectly (as they can't  disclose  what s discussed in therapy) fix it.\n\n If your son is mistaking something  then the therapist  can help him realize  his mistake/correct  the behavior/comprehension of the situation. \n\nIt's  all I ve got without  starting  to speculate on stuff I don't  know.  All the best.", "He\u2019s not a man, he\u2019s a boy. He\u2019s a child. \n\n\nYour teenage years are when you discover yourself. He\u2019s done nothing to indicate he\u2019s disgusted w himself for dating a girl. \n\nTouch some grass. These are children.", "I never said anything about that. I said that the way OP said it makes it come across as homophobic. I was trying to tell OP that they need to edit their post if they didn\u2019t mean for it come across as homophobic. I feel sympathy for the girl, but you\u2019re just putting words in my mouth", "That doesn't mean he should have to walk on eggshells in his own home while he tries to figure out who he is, and that's what you're expecting of him", "The issue is that op is saying that the son, who wants to talk to his family about how he feels and his crush, is being told he shouldn't cause his ex lives there and is not fair to her. \n\nHow is it fair to him, that he isn't allowed to talk about his life in his home to his family, without having to worry how his ex feels about it?", "Oh boy. Yeah I'm going with ESH what a hot mess.", "I assumed it was a family decision but I'm still unsure why you think that makes it okay for him to completely disregard her feeling ?", "That stuff takes time and neither you nor I have any knowledge on what all is being done.\n\nI love though that it seems you think the best option is to toss this girl on the streets.   What a great person you are. Have a day as good as you are.", "I'm sorry but the parents are definitely in the wrong.  He is 16.  He never should be living with his gf.  The idea that that's a stable situation is absurd.  Teenagers break up all the fricking time and it is unhealthy for a 16 yr old to be living with their SO in the first place.  If she needed a place to go, a platonic friend would be 100X more appropriate.", "He broke up with her In the last two weeks and immediately brings a new boy home. That's lacking in empathy. I don't think his sexuality has anything to do with it.", "I said Y and you understood Z. I'm not saying HE'S disgusted at himself for dating a girl, just that this girl could think that he didnt even liked her in the time they were together. That he looked at her and knew he didnt like girls but stayed with her anyway. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying he did something wrong. You're right, he's learning about himself. Just, can you imagine what this girl has gone through? That's it. \n\nAnd about man/boy, english is not my first language, so sometimes its hard to express what I'm thinking in the right way", "Also, teenage relationships on average are about as long-lasting as mayflies. Being a teenager is when most people explore dating and figure out what they're looking for and how to operate in relationship, and apparently this one wasn't the healthiest anyway (the son claims she was toxic and \"did stuff to him\")", "Not just that, but later on, OP even decides to add that the ex \"did things\" to son, in son's words that have made him absolutely flip on his opinion of her, and OP seems to just shrug, say \"who knows what that could mean\" and continue to prioritize the ex's feelings", "Considering OP\u2019s comments about the son\u2019s opinions, it does NOT seem like he had ANY say in this. He said this girl was a \u201cterrible girlfriend\u201d and his disregard for her feelings seems to imply that the breakup was not amicable on his side. And despite everything that happened to her\u2026we don\u2019t have any other context about the relationship aside from that \u201cterrible\u201d comment. For all we know, she could\u2019ve been deeply toxic towards him and he\u2019s justified for wanting nothing to do with her.", "Well should he be forced to never have a partner/bring someone home again until she moves out? Especially for queer kids it is important to have safespaces like their own homes to build their relationships. I feel sorry for the girl, but his mother can't put her feelings over her sons", "Of course it does, he's figuring out that he's not heterosexual and he's exploring his new urges. Like I said, if you're going to be so harsh on him, you can be on her too. Plenty of my peers in hs had brief relationships and I'm sure in a few years they'll all but forget 90% of them. Unfortunately, his are housed with him so he can't be open about himself. And i think it's fucked for the parents to ask this of their son.", "He is a man I am sorry this person is giving you a hard time for no reason.you were right in the first place.", "I understand and I apologize if it seemed like I was attacking you, but I was not and that wasn\u2019t my intention. \n\nEnglish is also not my mother tongue so I get it.", "Fair. I just think it's a real stretch to assume that parents would let their sons girlfriend move into their house ....without talking to him at least. But who knows it's a hot mess.", "I absolutely never said that. In fact the opposite. And I agree but I also think the mother can talk to her son about being more sensitive. That's why I'm torn between NAH and ES,  I think it's possible for him to consider the girls feeling given situation she's in and still bring his BF home etc. I also think the mom is \"dealing\" with her son coming out badly and instead of talking to him about how he deals with the messy breakup is using it as an excuse to basically \"not deal\" with the new BF. IDK it's a mess.", "Not being heterosexual does.not suddenly mean you lack empathy, Im unsure why you make that connection. And you think is wrong on his parents to offer an abused teen somewhere to stay? How old are you that you think a teen getting his leg over is the important thing in this situation?", "Thank you! It's okay. Maybe this person read my comment fast so they didn't get what I was trying to say. \u263a\ufe0f", "He is not a man, he\u2019s a child.", "At 16 you are a man or woman so I showed kindness. You were rude for no reason.", "Let me reiterate since you haven't understood what I was saying to begin with: \n\nI agree with their decision to take the ex  gf in if they saw a need. I agree the current household was a disaster. I have great empathy for her as far as that goes. I don't agree with the post or your sentiment that because they're doing a good thing, everyone else has to accomodate this girl. And if they are unable to achieve making sure EVERYONE, not just the ex gf, is happy and secure in their home, then they have to find other arrangements for this girl. \n\nI never said not being heterosexual does not mean you lack empathy, I was saying that if you see him as lacking in empathy for going out with boys and having normal teenage feelings then you can also see it as her lacking in empathy for not being understanding of his journey. \n\n>How old are you that you think a teen getting his leg over is the important thing in this situation?\n\nExcuse me? How old are you that you think a teenager figuring out their identity is not important? As I said TWICE I applaud them giving her a place to stay, I just don't agree with their decision to tell their SON that he needs to put his feelings and hormones on hold because THEY decided to house his ex gf at 16. She can stay, they just shouldn't dictate who or what he does for HER comfort. Because in this scenario, giving her means taking away from him and that's exactly why this was a bad idea to begin with. Now that they're in it, doing what they're proposing in this post is a surefire way to make sure they have taken something irreplaceable away from their son in their haste to give this girl a home.", "No they were being a jerk for no reason they need to touch grass.it\u2019s common sense that at 16 you call someone a man/women.", "[deleted]", "If it bothers you, keep scrolling!
