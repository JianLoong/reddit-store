{"id": 23294, "submission_id": "15bka6f", "title": "AITA: My fianc\u00e9\u2019s ex-wife would like to visit for the weekend and doesn\u2019t want me there.", "selftext": "Months ago, my fianc\u00e9 asked me if I would ever consider allowing his ex-wife to visit because she  misses the cat they used to share. A few weeks ago he also asked what I would need to happen to be comfortable with her staying for the weekend.  \n\nI asked for him for notice so that I can make sure things are tidy and there\u2019s a comfy place prepared for her to sleep. I also asked to of course \u2014 meet her. I think that these are reasonable expectations for any house guest.\n\nA little bit about me: I have a demanding job that keeps me awake and working late at night during the week and at times on weekends. I already know that this weekend is going to be a WFH situation and I am already physically and mentally tired. \n\nLast night, my fianc\u00e9 told me that his ex-wife plans on arriving Friday evening (2 day notice) and while she acknowledges that\u2019s it\u2019s nice that I\u2019m okay with her visiting, she would like confirmation that I will not be at home for the weekend because it\u2019s \u201cbad for her mental health\u201d to meet me and she just wants a weekend with the cat. My fianc\u00e9 suggested that we get a hotel and have a cute little weekend getaway while his ex-wife who refuses to meet me stays in our home. \n\nI\u2019m frustrated by this for several reasons:\n\n1. I don\u2019t think how or where I spend my time on the weekend should be dictated by a person who refuses to make eye contact with me\n\n2. I just want to be comfy and in my own home while I\u2019m reluctantly working on the weekend\n\n3. Why should money be spent on a hotel when the other party could simply acknowledge that I have a right to exist in my home  \n\n4. The entitlement. Her mental health can\u2019t handle meeting me? I\u2019m absolutely mentally ill and I\u2019m welcoming the woman who used to bang my fianc\u00e9 into our home with open arms and purchased new pillows/linens to make her more comfortable. I could also never imagine asking someone to leave their home for the weekend when they\u2019re admittedly doing me a favor\n\n5. This would not be a cute little weekend getaway. I have to work, do laundry, and all of the other chores one does during the weekend. I would be sitting in a hotel room working and stressing over the loads of laundry that I could be making progress on if I was able to be at home\n\n6. I\u2019m not comfortable leaving a stranger alone in my home\n\n7. WTF\n\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is annoyed that I don\u2019t want to leave for the weekend because I have things to do around the house and now his ex-wife is saying she might  not come. He thinks the cat will be sad and thinks I should be okay with her staying alone in our house for the weekend. \n\nThis woman hasn\u2019t attempted to see this cat in over 1.5 years. \n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT: \n\nI\u2019ve shared this with my fianc\u00e9 and he feels that I have publicized his private life while leaving out the following material facts:\n\n- This is the only cat he has had live for over 1 year\n- He gained custody of the cat after 3.5 years of being separated \n- His mother had a stroke and his ex-wife lives with his mother in case his mother has another stroke\n- I\u2019m making him out to be the \u2018bad guy\u2019 while he has been trying to mediate the issue \n\n\nHe also thinks I should get my own place. Additionally, I have been told she will not be coming this weekend. He\u2019s very angry with me.", "created_utc": 1690509496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bka6f/aita_my_fianc\u00e9s_exwife_would_like_to_visit_for/", "score": 3666, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMonths ago, my fianc\u00e9 asked me if I would ever consider allowing his ex-wife to visit because she  misses the cat they used to share. A few weeks ago he also asked what I would need to happen to be comfortable with her staying for the weekend.  \n\nI asked for him for notice so that I can make sure things are tidy and there\u2019s a comfy place prepared for her to sleep. I also asked to of course \u2014 meet her. I think that these are reasonable expectations for any house guest.\n\nA little bit about me: I have a demanding job that keeps me awake and working late at night during the week and at times on weekends. I already know that this weekend is going to be a WFH situation and I am already physically and mentally tired. \n\nLast night, my fianc\u00e9 told me that his ex-wife plans on arriving Friday evening (2 day notice) and while she acknowledges that\u2019s it\u2019s nice that I\u2019m okay with her visiting, she would like confirmation that I will not be at home for the weekend because it\u2019s \u201cbad for her mental health\u201d to meet me and she just wants a weekend with the cat. My fianc\u00e9 suggested that we get a hotel and have a cute little weekend getaway while his ex-wife who refuses to meet me stays in our home. \n\nI\u2019m frustrated by this for several reasons:\n\n1. I don\u2019t think how or where I spend my time on the weekend should be dictated by a person who refuses to make eye contact with me\n\n2. I just want to be comfy and in my own home while I\u2019m reluctantly working on the weekend\n\n3. Why should money be spent on a hotel when the other party could simply acknowledge that I have a right to exist in my home  \n\n4. The entitlement. Her mental health can\u2019t handle meeting me? I\u2019m absolutely mentally ill and I\u2019m welcoming the woman who used to bang my fianc\u00e9 into our home with open arms and purchased new pillows/linens to make her more comfortable. I could also never imagine asking someone to leave their home for the weekend when they\u2019re admittedly doing me a favor\n\n5. This would not be a cute little weekend getaway. I have to work, do laundry, and all of the other chores one does during the weekend. I would be sitting in a hotel room working and stressing over the loads of laundry that I could be making progress on if I was able to be at home\n\n6. I\u2019m not comfortable leaving a stranger alone in my home\n\n7. WTF\n\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is annoyed that I don\u2019t want to leave for the weekend because I have things to do around the house and now his ex-wife is saying she might  not come. He thinks the cat will be sad and thinks I should be okay with her staying alone in our house for the weekend. \n\nThis woman hasn\u2019t attempted to see this cat in over 1.5 years. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If not then tough tiddy says the kitty and you!! Your fiance is also being way less than fair for supporting this utter nonsense. Do you live in a large city, or somewhere that attracts tourists? If so, it sounds like she's trying to find a free Airbnb for a weekend getaway at your expense. Which also begs the question, did she even *offer* to pay for your hotel accommodations?? Not that it truly matters, she can shove right off, but if she not only expects you to vacate your home AND pay for it out of pocket she's not in her right state of mind.

The ex recently found out that they\u2019re engaged and it triggered something so she\u2019s trying to exert power over him again to feel validated - creating an unreasonable demand. It makes her feel like he still cares if he acquiesces. It\u2019s utterly ridiculous of course.", "Definitely some sort of mindfuckery on her part! If she was so concerned about the cat, she would have fought for it in the divorce.", "Cats do have attachment to their humans. Is it love? That\u2019s one for philosophers, but they\u2019re attached. The cat might miss her and might be happy to see her if she shows up.\n\nBut the cat\u2026 is a cat. That cat has no idea a guest might be coming and won\u2019t be disappointed if it doesn\u2019t happen", "Right? That one threw me for a loop. The whole thing sounds like a straight jacket special.", "Fianc\u00e9 said the cat will be sad if she can\u2019t come over.\ud83d\ude02 Op might want to reconsider her engagement. His actions are too suspect.", "It is possible that the ex-wife is unaware of OP's existence, and that fianc\u00e9 could not come up with an excuse to meet her at a hotel rather than at his home", "She's working this weekend. Who says this guy is going to be in the hotel room or out at the movies while this wife is at work?", "But why wouldn\u2019t he go away with the ex? Why make OP go away?\n\nUnless he plans to have his ex move OP\u2019s things out of the house while they are away?", "Top comment on taking the cat to mom's house. All fixed!", "AND she lives with his mom??? Do no other family members exist?? It's sus", "For the edits. \n\nThey are engaged and he wants her to move out and get her own place over her not being comfortable with fianc\u00e9's ex having sole control of her home for the weekend  - to the point where ex wanted boot her from it? Sure, OP used plural regarding the hotel, so fianc\u00e9 would have come with, but that doesn't help much.\n\nMethinks this relationship is owner, OP just doesn't know it yet...", "The bit about this is the only cat that has lived for over 1 year is disturbing. WTH", "This guy is exhibiting so many red flags that he must be absolutely covered in them. I have no idea why OP has even agreed to marry him, but I'd be running for the damn hills. Yikes on a bike.", "Or ex-wife suddenly can\u2019t stay in the house alone because it\u2019s \u201cbad for her mental health.\u201d", "Or he goes out while OP is working. \nOP you have a fiance problem. Do get your own place- and a new fiance.", "I want to know when the wedding date is and when the ex found out about it.", "Right, the ex-wife lives with her ex-MIL? Weird.", "At this point are we even sure the cat isn't a fabrication?", "\ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude39 they did but all he said was \"meow\"", "I didn't even think of that the possibility that Ex wasn't aware of OP but I think you nailed it.", "Right.  This guy just needs 2 hours of plausible deniability twice over 2 days and he gets exactly what he wants, he could probably care less where the rest of the balance of time puts him.  OP needs to reschedule her work days so she can enjoy the hotel vacation with her fiance, and watch him agitate himself til he snaps on her and storms off for no reason.\n\nEta: no shit she ain't coming now, what would be the point if you're wise to the plan.  Get your own place but stay together? Now it sounds like it would be worth a visit again.", "Not only that, but they've been together long enough to be engaged, and yet she has never once met the woman living with her soon to be MIL?", "RIGHT. That's highly concerning and if someone has a string of pet deaths all in less than a year each? They probably shouldn't own pets", "Or starts a fight and leaves. Goes MIA", "Wait\u2026 do I exist?", "Even if they were older rescue cats, they would last longer than a year. \n\nHow many cats are we talking about also?"]}
