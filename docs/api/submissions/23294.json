A few weeks ago he also asked what I would need to happen to be comfortable with her staying for the weekend.  \n\nI asked for him for notice so that I can make sure things are tidy and there\u2019s a comfy place prepared for her to sleep. I also asked to of course \u2014 meet her. I think that these are reasonable expectations for any house guest.\n\nA little bit about me: I have a demanding job that keeps me awake and working late at night during the week and at times on weekends. I already know that this weekend is going to be a WFH situation and I am already physically and mentally tired. \n\nLast night, my fianc\u00e9 told me that his ex-wife plans on arriving Friday evening (2 day notice) and while she acknowledges that\u2019s it\u2019s nice that I\u2019m okay with her visiting, she would like confirmation that I will not be at home for the weekend because it\u2019s \u201cbad for her mental health\u201d to meet me and she just wants a weekend with the cat. My fianc\u00e9 suggested that we get a hotel and have a cute little weekend getaway while his ex-wife who refuses to meet me stays in our home. \n\nI\u2019m frustrated by this for several reasons:\n\n1. I don\u2019t think how or where I spend my time on the weekend should be dictated by a person who refuses to make eye contact with me\n\n2. I just want to be comfy and in my own home while I\u2019m reluctantly working on the weekend\n\n3. Why should money be spent on a hotel when the other party could simply acknowledge that I have a right to exist in my home  \n\n4. The entitlement. Her mental health can\u2019t handle meeting me? I\u2019m absolutely mentally ill and I\u2019m welcoming the woman who used to bang my fianc\u00e9 into our home with open arms and purchased new pillows/linens to make her more comfortable. I could also never imagine asking someone to leave their home for the weekend when they\u2019re admittedly doing me a favor\n\n5. This would not be a cute little weekend getaway. I have to work, do laundry, and all of the other chores one does during the weekend. I would be sitting in a hotel room working and stressing over the loads of laundry that I could be making progress on if I was able to be at home\n\n6. I\u2019m not comfortable leaving a stranger alone in my home\n\n7. WTF\n\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is annoyed that I don\u2019t want to leave for the weekend because I have things to do around the house and now his ex-wife is saying she might  not come. He thinks the cat will be sad and thinks I should be okay with her staying alone in our house for the weekend. \n\nThis woman hasn\u2019t attempted to see this cat in over 1.5 years. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690509496, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15bka6f/aita_my_fianc\u00e9s_exwife_would_like_to_visit_for/", "score": 757, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If that bothers you move on", "NTA you're being really flexible and gracious even allowing her to come over! I would not be comfortable with her in my house alone....", "NTA. Something tells me it's not the cat the ex-wife has been missing...", ">his ex-wife is saying she might not come.\n\nTell her not to threaten you with a good time\n\n>He thinks the cat will be sad\n\nWTF? The cat doesn't care. The cat probably doesn't even remember her. It's not like the cat is a child who's been promised a visit with mom and will be heartbroken and disappointed.

Your fiance wants to make an offer he is not entitled to make.", ">He thinks the cat will be sad \n\nThe lesson here is not to get the cat's hopes up. Your fianc\u00e9e shouldn't have told the cat anything about it before the visit was certain. \n\nNTA.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMonths ago, my fianc\u00e9 asked me if I would ever consider allowing his ex-wife to visit because she  misses the cat they used to share. A few weeks ago he also asked what I would need to happen to be comfortable with her staying for the weekend.  \n\nI asked for him for notice so that I can make sure things are tidy and there\u2019s a comfy place prepared for her to sleep. I also asked to of course \u2014 meet her. I think that these are reasonable expectations for any house guest.\n\nA little bit about me: I have a demanding job that keeps me awake and working late at night during the week and at times on weekends. I already know that this weekend is going to be a WFH situation and I am already physically and mentally tired. \n\nLast night, my fianc\u00e9 told me that his ex-wife plans on arriving Friday evening (2 day notice) and while she acknowledges that\u2019s it\u2019s nice that I\u2019m okay with her visiting, she would like confirmation that I will not be at home for the weekend because it\u2019s \u201cbad for her mental health\u201d to meet me and she just wants a weekend with the cat. My fianc\u00e9 suggested that we get a hotel and have a cute little weekend getaway while his ex-wife who refuses to meet me stays in our home. \n\nI\u2019m frustrated by this for several reasons:\n\n1. I don\u2019t think how or where I spend my time on the weekend should be dictated by a person who refuses to make eye contact with me\n\n2. I just want to be comfy and in my own home while I\u2019m reluctantly working on the weekend\n\n3. Why should money be spent on a hotel when the other party could simply acknowledge that I have a right to exist in my home  \n\n4. The entitlement. Her mental health can\u2019t handle meeting me? I\u2019m absolutely mentally ill and I\u2019m welcoming the woman who used to bang my fianc\u00e9 into our home with open arms and purchased new pillows/linens to make her more comfortable. I could also never imagine asking someone to leave their home for the weekend when they\u2019re admittedly doing me a favor\n\n5. This would not be a cute little weekend getaway. I have to work, do laundry, and all of the other chores one does during the weekend. I would be sitting in a hotel room working and stressing over the loads of laundry that I could be making progress on if I was able to be at home\n\n6. I\u2019m not comfortable leaving a stranger alone in my home\n\n7. WTF\n\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is annoyed that I don\u2019t want to leave for the weekend because I have things to do around the house and now his ex-wife is saying she might  not come. He thinks the cat will be sad and thinks I should be okay with her staying alone in our house for the weekend. \n\nThis woman hasn\u2019t attempted to see this cat in over 1.5 years. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also, wtf is wrong with your husband", "Not true....my exs cat remembered me after 3 years....then again I don't kno the cat in question so I can't speak on its memory or lac thereof", "Hahah, my first thought was to reply, \u201cWhat the fuck is happening here?!\u201d But I\u2019ll just glom onto yours.", "I was thinking it\u2019s Cathy. JessiCathy?", "My exact thoughts.", "He's stressed because his boss might not approve the time off request, a lot of other cats already asked for those days off", "Facts!", "And ONLY let the cat go to a pet friendly Airbnb if it's chipped in your fiance's name and you know where she lives so you can go get it back when ex-wife inevitably tries to steal it.", "'he is an egg'\n\nThanks for the chuckle I can't stop reading it", "Ex wife and fianc\u00e9 going to lock her out the house and say they're back together? Idk this is wild", "Nah, she\u2019s not trying to steal the cat, just wants to reconnect with her ex husband. The fianc\u00e9 wants her out of the house so he can fuck his ex wife at home. The ex wife probably doesn\u2019t even know that OP exists.", "Yeah that was my first guess like this is totally very weird and he 'thinks the cat will be sad'. Something is very sus here. I'm guessing he'll get called away from the hotel by work or something", "OP needs to walk away, for real\nBut until then, don't go anywhere sit right in your own damn couch ask weekend", "Thank you. We all didn\u2019t wanna say this. Haha the \u201ccat\u201d will be sad.", "The fianc\u00e9 seems to think the cat is like a kid asking for their lost mother \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not the only one that was like \u201cwtf. The ex is so mentally unstable she\u2019s traveling to see a cat and displacing 2 humans?\u201d", "lol not hers to keep but yeah, kick him out for sure", "Agree with all that. Was also kinda makes me wonder if they are still banging, is the fact that he\u2019s now engaged after leaving his ex-wife 1.5yrs ago\u2026. Isn\u2019t that quick to put a ring on someone else? Although that\u2019s me assuming that\u2019s how long it\u2019s been since ex-wife hasn\u2019t seen the cat in 1.5yrs", "Yep! Ex wife doesn\u2019t know fianc\u00e9e exists.", "I definitely saw this as cheating untill the little trip but now idk maybe he's got some dumb plan", "Exactly!!! Any sadness the cat experienced was like a year and a half ago when the ex left \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f this is all very silly. Part of breakups is grieving pets you say goodbye to. It's just overall a bad idea. And if they let her visit once, it will become a regular request", "I agree, however, I don\u2019t think the fianc\u00e9 is planning on staying in the house with the ex. His intention is to let her roam freely around their house by herself.", "\ud83e\udd23 sorry man this is just ridiculous", "I have read some dopey stuff on Reddit but a cat being sad because someone who hasn't seen them in a year and half a not visiting takes the biscuit.", "The whole thing is gross. OP needs to be on phone to the ex wife. I\u2019m suspicious of both the ex wife and fianc\u00e9. Someone is playing funny buggers here", "Inviting the ex as a cat sitter to plan a secret surprise trip?", "Happy cake day!", "That's still a hard no. Under no circumstances (especially ridiculous ones like this) would I allow someone to roam around my home without supervision. They can take what they want, use what they want, and break what they want.", "More like plan to get away to sleep with the ex"]}
