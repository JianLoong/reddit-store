My husband (40 M) and I decided a few days ago to take the kids to our local restaurant, as a treat, because we don't do that often. My husband is a bit of a health nut, and is VERY restrictive of the foods my kids eat, which is the main source of our arguments.\n\nOn Thursday, we went to the restaurant, and the kids were super excited. The server was asking what the kids wanted, when my 12 year old (We'll call her Emily) said, \"Cheeseburger with bacon\". My husband butted in and said, \"With lettuce and tomato\" Emily's face immediately fell. My husband didn't even notice, and Emily looked super bummed.\n\nAfter the sever took our orders, my husband turned to Emily, and asked her what's wrong. She said that she didn't want lettuce and tomato on her burger, because she doesn't like them. He sighed and said that that they've been through this a million times, and having vegetables with every meal was super important. Emily looked like she was about to cry. She is neurodivergent and a lot of food taste's and textures really bother her, tomatoes being a large one. My husband doesn't seem to care, which REALLY bothers me.\n\nWhen the food came, Emily didn't even touch the burger. So when my husband went to the bathroom, I took the lettuce and tomato off the burger, put them on mine, and winked at Emily. She grinned and gladly ate her burger. My husband didn't say anything about it, until that night.\n\nHe told me that taking the vegetables off was a violation of his trust, because he was just looking out for our daughter. I told him that it was just one meal, and not having vegetables ONCE wasn't a big deal. He said that those vegetables were very important. I left the room, and have been talking to him as little as possible. So Reddit, AITA for taking the vegetables off my daughters burger? I think I might be TAH because it's just lettuce and tomato, and my kids having vegetables is really important to my husband, but I feel like he was being super controlling, and I NEVER want to see my child upset.", "created_utc": 1681605866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nozcp/aita_for_taking_the_vegetables_of_my_kids_burgers/", "score": 449, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is setting your child up to have an unhealthy relationship with food. This is SO important to understand. Associating upset and even shame with food is putting your poor child on an incredibly dangerous road. It\u2019s not just about the husband being super controlling (which he is, like dude\u2026. Yikes. There\u2019s a LOT to unpack there), it\u2019s about how this will seriously mess up your child more than you might know. I pray this poor girl doesn\u2019t develop an eating disorder.

She is neurodivergent and a lot of food taste's and textures really bother her, tomatoes being a large one. My husband doesn't seem to care\n\nOh EFF THAT! Insisting on a treat meal containing a food the kid can't stand is just about control and is cruel. It's literally putting food ideology before her total wellbeing. If vegetables were so important, why didn't he  tell her BEFORE ordering that she had to pick a vegetable with her meal?\n\nWhat your husband actually taught your kid is \"because he said-so.\"  Because if vegetables were the main part. He would have asked her to pick a vegetable as a side dish to have with her bacon burger. Even if he'd forgotten beforehand, he could have asked her what vegetable she picked. He didn't. He decided to punish a 12 year old because she didn't pick a treat meal healthy enough to his liking and ordered a food that makes her unable to eat her meal. He's 100% the AH.\n\nEdit:I have 4 kids. Restaurant meals and parties, we do not insist on eating anything other than what they will actually eat. Why create a problem where there isn't one? And YES at least 1 of my kids pretty much ate only sugar at parties for years. Getting the kid to eat nutritious meals consistently was far more important than policing parties and restaurants.", "NTA.\n\nYes, vegetables ARE important for people to eat.  However, not having them on a burger isn't going to change your daughter's health situation.  And there are a myriad of other vegetables from which she can choose.  Your husband needs to learn how to encourage your kids to eat a variety of foods and not dictate it to them.  Dictating food choices will only make the kids hate them more and drive a wedge between the kids and dad.\n\nI'm decades older than your kids and to this day, I cannot stand tomatoes or pickles.  YUCK!  And my parents did try to make me eat a tomato when I ordered a salad.  We sat at that table for a LONG time cuz no way was I eating that tomato.  And it's funny cuz my father won't eat cucumbers.  LOL!  Now we swap vegetables!  LOL.", "NTA.

Of course, kids need guidance with making positive food choices, but their relationship with food right now is arguably more important. The constant pressure of eating healthy is going to land them just like your husband- which seems like an unhealthy obsession. Eating disorders or other mental health difficulties surrounding foods can start and are so hard to get under control.", "NTA. \n\nThere\u2019s very little nutritional value in lettuce and tomato so your husband can just suck on them.", "NTA, your husband is wanting to be the father of children with eating disorders and a daughter who does not trust him further than I could sling the Statue of Liberty.  Get the kids into counseling and keep protecting those babies momma!", "I know this guy. I was married to one too. He\u2019s a real pain in the ass. Unless he wants to give his kid an eating disorder, he needs to lay off how much he controls her food. Yes.  As parents we absolutely have to regulate our children\u2019s food, but a piece of nutritionally devoid, lettuce and slice of tomato, that\u2019s a Control problem not a nutrition problem. I know this because it happened to me. He tried to control my food backfired spectacularly binged every moment I got away from him. Especially having a neurodivergent child we need to respect their choices and find creative ways to ensure the nutrition is optimal that are agreeable to the child. Otherwise they will not eat at all. Good luck. NTA", "NTA for the burger thing, but absolutely you should be reconsidering your relationship with a man who treats your children this way.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sure there are vegetables and fruit your daughter likes and a different meal time when she eats them.  I have a 22 year old niece with some food issues because my brother did crap like this when she was young", "NTA  I get what your husband is saying but one meal - especially a special one - does not need to be policed by anyone. The idea of a meal out is to have fun with family and friends. If your husband can't control himself just leave him home and take the kids out by yourself to lunch. It will be more fun for everyone.", "NTA. Vegetables are important, but so is a healthy relationship with food. I don't think adding lettuce and tomato to a burger is going to make that big of a difference to the overal nutrition or her vegetable intake. But it will make a difference when she's not allowed to choose her foods and isn't allowed to eat foods in ways that are enjoyable to her. She won't eat vegetables as an adult if they're forced on her in ways she finds gross as a kid. Help her find ways to eat vegetables that she actually finds appealing.", "NTA. As someone who once threw up because my parents made me eat raw tomato,  it's hard to describe how big a deal \"I don't like this\" can be. Nothing about what your husband is doing is productive,  twisting kids arms to eat arbitrary vegetables isn't going to make them eat vegetables long term,  which is the most important thing.  \n\nYou need to teach kids that some vegetables are good,  actually,  and that they need to seek those out.  \n\nAs for contradicting your husband, it takes two to tango. If your partner makes a bad call and isn't listening to reason, your hands aren't tied to blindly follow their lead.", "NTA for taking the lettuce and tomato off your daughters burger so she could eat it. You might be the asshole for not doing it in front of your husband. Because he was massively out of line. I understand this is a constant cause of fighting for you and I sympathize. The very best advice about feeding kids on the whole is the opposite of what he does. He is doing a job on your kids, and the repercussions will extend beyond what they do or don\u2019t eat. I promise you that.", "NTA - Your husband needs to lighten up but you two need to have a private conversation and figure out some middle ground. Lettuce doesn't even have much nutritional value. It gets put on burgers to make them look bigger.", "You need to take your husband to whoever he\u2019ll listen to and convince him to stop this behavior. His mother, a therapist, show him this post, whoever. Because this not how you teach your kids to make good food choices, this is how you give your child an eating disorder. And she already has difficulty with certain foods. \n\nIm going with ESH because this needs to be addressed with your husband rather than teaching your daughter to start hiding things from her parents.", "NTA.\n\nBluntly speaking, lettuce and tomato on a burger isn't vegetable.  In fact, tomato is FRUIT (don't get me started) and plain lettuce has no nutritional value, other than a little fiber.\n\nAll you really did by removing the lettuce and tomato was to make it possible for your daughter to enjoy eating her burger.\n\nYour husband sounds a bit insane.  First, he's so obsessed with nutrition but thinks that it's possible to make a burger healthy???  Second, if your daughter eats a burger the way she wants to eat a burger, he thinks that's a violation of trust?  \n\nWhere is the contract your kids signed stating that they will eat everything dad says and ONLY what dad says, forever, under penalty of painful death?  (facepalm)", "NTA A leaf or two of, most likely, iceberg lettuce has no nutritional value.  The 2 slices of non-heritage tomato has minimal nutrition.  These are things your health nut husband should be very aware of.  \n\nIf he knows your daughter is neurodivergent and texture adverse to, but is insisting she eat these low-to-no nutitional value items on a treat day, he's not concerned with healthy eating.   He's concerned with control.", "NTA, that is what pickles and ketchup are for.", "NTA - he is makeing a lot of efforts to have kids with eating disorders. And, while it may comes from caring, it seems too controlling. You shouldn't have taken the vegetables behind his back though. But, as in my, opinion, it is very minor comparing to forcing a kid to eat vegetables during a meal the is supposed to be a threat, I still think the husband is the asshole.", "INFO - Is he their father?

Sensory issues around food are very real and I'm glad your daughter has someone in her life who respects that.", "NTA texture in food is huge to me (like as an adult I can eat almost anything but okra, just... no). \n     Also, forcing/restricting children's diets can lead to eating disorders and body dismorphia.\ngood luck", "NTA, a slice of tomato and some lettuce isn't going to make any significant difference, nutrition-wise. A burger is a burger, it's meant to be a treat. Your husband could have just given your daughter some raw veggies or something when you got home. \n\nYeah, in theory, it's not great to go behind your spouse's back. But he was being very unreasonable and ruining your outing.", "NTA - I'm an adult who still takes tomato off burgers (and prefers to order without it in the first place, as even removed it still lingers) due to taste and texture issues.\n\nThere are plenty of other vegetable options out there to try.\n\nAlso lettuce had little to no nutritional value (especially iceberg) when compared to other greens.", "ESH. Y'all are supposed to be a united front. I feel for your kiddo lettuce and tomato aren't really \"veg with dinner\" but you two undermining eachother is not going to end well. Does husband understand daughter has a medical condition? Are there veggies daughter DOES like that could have been ordered instead? It sounds like dad is trying to get her nutritional needs met but is goin about it like a bull in a china shop. There's more ways to get a neurodivergent person to get their vitamins and minerals than brute force. And there are more ways to get dad to be a little more understanding than waiting for him to leave & doing something behind his back. \n\n\nY'all need to talk to eachother & come up with a more creative solution. Forcing someone on the spectrum to eat things that repulse them is setting them up for the eating disorder ARFID which spectrum people are already at a greater risk of developing.", "NTA \n\nYou just care for your daughter.

If it's that friggen important she can have a side of green beans or whatever else the resturant has.  \n\nI'm 35 and loathe tomatoes.

The sneakier you get in undermining him, the more controlling he will get, and then you will find yet more strategies to enable your children to ignore his directions and curry favour with them as the 'popular' parent. All you're doing is teaching your kids to play one parent off against another.\n\nStand up for what you believe when coming to agreement on parenting expectations. Don't agree then undermine your partner. That's cowardly.", "NTA..and there is a bigger issue here. You both need to address how to support your daughter (& all the kids) enjoying food; given you shared she is neurodivergent. Also, labeling food as bad or good is foundational beliefs related to eating disorders.  There has to be a better way than shutting her down about bacon during the height of excitement eating out.

It is really confusing for kids to get mixed information from parents. Communicate with each other and figure out how to deal with these kinds of things in the future. How will you feel when Emily asks you for something, you say no, so she just goes to ask dad who says yes. Your kids need to know that while the two of you may not agree on everything, that they can expect consistency from you both. Studies actually show that it is healthy for kids to watch parents have disagreements and work through them so they can develop those skills on their own, so it could have been a nice moment to have a chat with your husband about why you think Emily shouldn't have to eat the vegetables instead of just going behind his back. FWIW your husband is also the asshole here by trying to force you daughter to eat something she doesn't like, but that's a different issue.", "ESH hubby needs to chill it's a cheeseburger but also it's never good to undermine parental authority especially in front of kids.

A violation of trust in this case is forcing a kid to eat foods that bother her and potentially causing her to develop food issues in the future. My suggestion for the next time you go out, is to pack some fruits or vegetables in your purse that you know your daughter will eat. That way, if she wants a bacon burger, you can at least whip out the stuff you brought. She can have her burger, dad can see her eat something healthy on the side.

The tests are like $20 at Amazon, we use the one from Bartovation.\n\nSupertasters experience food tastes, textures, and spiciness much more intensely than regular or non-tasters and your husband could be forcing your kid(s) to eat food that is literally nauseating to them, and not just them being 'picky'.\n\nI was that kid and my early life has a horrific, neverending onslaught of a) being forced to eat food that LITERALLY made me sick and traumatized me and b) being shamed for being 'picky' when I knew I wasn't.\n\nFortunately my mom finally figured out I wasn't being a brat, but the concept of 'supertasters' didn't exist in the 1960s so we had an uneasy truce where she tried to always have at least one known-palatable food with each meal.\n\nI also negotiated an option of me making my own food which has led to me being a pretty handy cook. \n\nNow I eat LOTS of stuff because once the danger of forced ingestion is removed I was able to freely explore all kinds of foods.

My husband (40 M) and I decided a few days ago to take the kids to our local restaurant, as a treat, because we don't do that often. My husband is a bit of a health nut, and is VERY restrictive of the foods my kids eat, which is the main source of our arguments.\n\nOn Thursday, we went to the restaurant, and the kids were super excited. The server was asking what the kids wanted, when my 12 year old (We'll call her Emily) said, \"Cheeseburger with bacon\". My husband butted in and said, \"With lettuce and tomato\" Emily's face immediately fell. My husband didn't even notice, and Emily looked super bummed.\n\nAfter the sever took our orders, my husband turned to Emily, and asked her what's wrong. She said that she didn't want lettuce and tomato on her burger, because she doesn't like them. He sighed and said that that they've been through this a million times, and having vegetables with every meal was super important. Emily looked like she was about to cry. She is neurodivergent and a lot of food taste's and textures really bother her, tomatoes being a large one. My husband doesn't seem to care, which REALLY bothers me.\n\nWhen the food came, Emily didn't even touch the burger. So when my husband went to the bathroom, I took the lettuce and tomato off the burger, put them on mine, and winked at Emily. She grinned and gladly ate her burger. My husband didn't say anything about it, until that night.\n\nHe told me that taking the vegetables off was a violation of his trust, because he was just looking out for our daughter. I told him that it was just one meal, and not having vegetables ONCE wasn't a big deal. He said that those vegetables were very important. I left the room, and have been talking to him as little as possible. So Reddit, AITA for taking the vegetables off my daughters burger?

But her father should be a safe space, not the one forcing things that upset her on her when it\u2019s easily avoidable.

I\u2019m a bit surprised by your poor word choice considering your background but hey we all make mistakes", "Right?? Iceberg lettuce has zero nutritional value, it's essentially water in leaf form...", "My thoughts exactly", "I agree. Crunchy water and gross watery tomato, out of season.
