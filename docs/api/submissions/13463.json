Is she mad because you guys aren\u2019t going to be working together or is it because you told her one thing and did something else? Did you both apply to this job? Did you apply to places without her and she didn\u2019t based off what you said?", "Nta. I mean, you're just being practical here. You need to pay rent soon.

Who knows how long it will be until someone is hiring multiple people for a role that both of you can do?  Makes way more sense for at least one of you to have an income whilst the other keeps searching, and if working together is what you both want you can always look into that opportunity further down the road.", "NTA for being practical. Although you could have talked about the job offer with your significant other before accepting it. In that regard, YTH as she might have felt betrayed after you said that both of you should get a job at the same place.

Like, in an ideal situation you\u2019d be able to work together? Unfortunately life is often not ideal, especially when rent is due soon. I can understand if she was just disappointed, but she also has to understand that money is a necessity & you can\u2019t both just wait until the ideal job you can both work at comes along", "NTA.

You\u2019re doing the adult thing, your wife needs to let this go.", "NTA, but WHY this arrangement of yours, of having to work in the same place, how does that make any sense?\n\nCase in point, you were BOTH in a seasonal job.

It sounds like you did the best you could in a difficult situation. It's understandable that you would have to make a tough decision and you had to do what was best for you and your family. That doesn't mean you don't care about your wife's feelings, it just means that you had to make a hard choice. It's a shame that you two weren't able to find a job together, but you can still support each other in your job searches.

I saw that you're her main transportation; if you're not somewhere rural, she needs to learn how to navigate public transit. If you are or there's some other reason she can't do public transit, she needs to get her license (edit: or find other transportation via Uber or similar which is not you, since there are also reasons people can't get licenses).", "NTA \n\nYour wife needs to grow up, she\u2019s 26 not a child.

You betrayed her.", "Not heavy, but YTA specifically for taking the job on your own without telling her that you were considering taking jobs solo. Largely because *you* were the one who said you wanted to be able to get hired together.\n\n I recognize that taking the job was a survival thing, but the question at hand is about how you handled her feelings. I'd feel more strongly about this judgment if you guys were not literally unemployed right now.

The agreement you guys have will not work. You must know that or you would not have applied.\n\nThe people criticizing you are not correct. You did the right thing. You have to eat and pay rent.

Take a job to keep the utilities on and the landlord happy, or try to have fun without power and a landlord ready to serve eviction notices. The choice makes itself.
