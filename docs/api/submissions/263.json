It seems totally unprovoked. I don't speed, cut people off or anything like that.. I try my best to not be a butthead when I drive. I always make room for those awkward situations when traffic is stopped and someone is trying to turn into the road. The only thing I can figure is triggering people is my cargo rack. \n\nAm I the asshole for keeping it on 24/7? \n\n I use it alot to move stuff and help friends out with large loads because U-Haul gets pricey.

Am I an asshole or are is there a stick up these people's ass?\n\n\n\nEdit: these questions have been asked alot\n\nNo controversial bumper stickers or writing on my vehicle.\n\nNothing hanging or dangling\n\nAlways follow the speed limit or flow of traffic, though I avoid going 5 over on city streets, 10 on highway. I only go under if im hauling a full load or have a tip hazard on my roof rack. Hazard lights are used in those cases. \n\nI use my blinkers\n\nI compensate as though I'm pulling a trailer to avoid close calls. \n\nReflectors are compliant with the law and are not blinding.\n\n Nothing goes on the rack unless it's secured and all straps are tied tight.\n\nThe rack is secure and does not bounce or wiggle excessively. \n\nMy driving habits come straight out of any drivers ed course. I'm familiar with road etiquette and keep to it as I frequently drive across the country.\n\nMy car fits in a regular parking spot and the rack does not stick out of the parking space.", "created_utc": 1667247594, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yinq32/aita_for_keeping_my_hitch_rack_on/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Always at the limit or up to 5ish over depending on the flow of traffic. I use the progressive tool to track my driving. I have to pay more if I drive like a butt. My stickers are non political. They all say goldstock with the event number for each sticker. I'm a gold miner so I like to slap mining stickers on there. Nothing that could be construed as hateful, political or controversial.", "I don't put political stickers or controversial things on my car. I've heard of people having their car messed with for that", "No, I hate being that guy if I can help it. I'll go a bit under on the freeway if I have a full load or a tip hazard from my roof rack. Though I stay in the right lane when I do.", "No, my plate is clearly visible.", "Indeed.  I suspect more to the story.", "If they are, I can live with that. I don't need any speeding tickets to spend my gas money on. Especially in Wayne county.", "It's a V6. Not a beefy one either. My car isn't loud or obnoxious. Just a mom wagon with a cargo hitch rack, cb antenna, and roof rack.", "Absolutely. I'm anal about keeping my car legal and safe. Reflectors are not optional on hitch racks, trailers etc, in my opinion.", "When I get on freeways, I try to stick to the flow of the lane unless it's 80+. In that case, I just move to the right and stay out of the way the best I can. \n\nI used to drive 96 and Southfield everyday. If you know, you know lol.\n\nExcept in areas that I know have cops hanging out. I'll move to the right and stay out of sight at or slightly above the limit.", "Nothing is on it unless it's an inanimate object with more ratchet straps than necessary. The only stickers on it are white and red reflectors. \n\nI go as far to clear leaves off before I get in to go anywhere. I park under a tree. \n\nThe only time a living being has been on it was at a private campground to grab some fire wood from the fire wood trailer.", "Lol no it's usually empty when people rage at me.", "It's mostly in metropolitan areas where people are horrible behind the wheel. It's alot different further out from high population areas, no one is in a hurry.", "No i am not", "While I admit, I could make it more visible, there is no law prohibiting it as it is. In Michigan, most people won't even put reflectors on. Seeing that it does not make my vehicle any longer than a pickup truck and is clearly visible during the day and night (the sides also have reflectors and my tail lights illuminate it well), I don't think it's necessary to paint it. \n\nThe reason lumber or oversize objects require a flag is to alert other drivers of a potentially unsecured load that may cause damage to another vehicle. \n\nA cargo rack does not fall under that type of law in any state because it is a secured extension of the vehicle. It more closely fits in the category of trailer lights/reflective markings. \n\nI am going to add more reflective tape, however, putting poles on and giving it a paint job is kind of overkill and I'm not obligated to by any law. I would argue that adding said poles and paint makes it a hazard and might be a distraction to other drivers.", "If you\u2019re sitting in the passing lane at 5 over that would almost certainly inspire the sort of rage you\u2019re describing and people aggressively passing you on the right. It\u2019s also against MI traffic code to stay in that lane if not passing. If you\u2019re not doing that then honestly it\u2019s still probably your speed inspiring the anger. NTA but you might want to work on your deductive skills.", "These days people could be mad because you AREN'T speeding, sadly.", "I don't see how some rack would cause that behavior. From my experience. Most of the angry driver stuff is related to going too slow. Maybe you're often in those areas where everyone drives like a maniac and ignores the speed limit. We all know roads and highways like that. All I can say is screw them. If you are following the law and going at least the speed limit (conditions permitting). Ignore them.\n\nMy normal routine is going the speed limit or 2-3 MPH over. I get all sorts of tailgaters. They get really close then blow past me when the road opens up. To heck with them. I'm not going to drive dangerously or get a ticket for them. Let them get pissed.", "Yeah I want to ask OP if they have any controversial bumper stickers or something lol.", "Then NTA as far as I can tell", "Oh I get it, I take 96 every day into Ann Arbor, some days I'm shocked I didn't die. \n\nBack in August I lost control of my vehicle on 96 trying to avoid another car that was about to side swipe me. \nI spun across all 4 lanes and by some miracle wasn't injured.", "Are the ratchet straps dangling? Flying behind you like a banner?", "Well that's one possible reason down.", "This is true but I don't do that. Since I road trip so often, road etiquette comes naturally. I merge where I belong according to law and basic rules of the road.", "Oh I know it. There's a freeway here where the speed limit is 55. You can be run off the road if you go under 70. Watched it happen several times.", "Wayne county is filled with crazy drivers. I just had to make sure I'm not the asshole over it. It didn't start until I started leaving my rack on. I simply do not comprehend the mindsets of the other drivers getting angry.\n\n Its common on my daily route to be stuck behind someone going 35 in a 45. As soon as they are out of the way, I usually go up to 50 but there's always cops on that route so I can't be playing nascar for everyone behind me. My job requires me to have a license so I can get across the country with my gear.", "I do not. Unless you count my gold mining event stickers? They just say \"goldstock\" \n\nI don't put controversy on my car. I like having windows.", "Jeeeez I'm glad you're ok! 96 is one place I'd love to see more police hanging out. And I don't even like police. I just want people to respect my safety. \n\nMy aunt just got rear-ended on the Southfield ramp to 96 the other week. Dude totaled his car. She was ok, but the trunk caved in. Not a week after, one of my friends got into an accident and the guy in the backseat didn't make it. \n\nIdk how to solve the problem besides not being part of it.", "Never. Always tight, excess is always tied up so it doesn't dangle", "If you are strictly maintaining the speed limit within 5 MPH, this is why people are raging out at you. I\u2019m in no way saying they\u2019re right, but that\u2019s why. Not some cargo rack.", "That is so odd. I have heard the drivers in Michigan are brutal but this is next level lol.", " if I could get from Macomb county to Ann Arbor without getting on a freeway, I would.\nI just try to stay out of the death lanes unless I'm passing a semi or realllllly slow car. And if I can take the back roads I go that route.", "And it only happens in Michigan. I drive all over the US.", "But even at stop lights? Someone who hasn't been driving behind or around me pulled up today and screamed something at me. I didn't hear what. I just looked at them and went on about my business.", "When I moved back here in July, my last leg of I75 almost killed me and my S/O. Dude in a pickup got in front of us going 45, so I politely put my blinker on and passed. He proceeded to ride my butt, tried to PIT me, block me from getting on the exit ramp, and waved a gun at us. Michigan drivers are terrible and I don't have this problem in any other state. I even get compliments for my car in other states.", "Absolutely. Always safer on main roads and side roads here. And better for sanity. It's not like this in any other states I've been.", "Can you share a picture of the back of your car?", "Well, maybe leave a little more room when you pass? Maybe they think you are cutting it too close with the rack?", "https://imgur.com/a/mV1KknZ", "Sure. Lemme fire up imgur", "Not at all. Overcompensate or compensate someones wallet. I pull trailers from time to time and pretend my rack is the equivalent to a dinky U-Haul trailer just to be safe.", "It certainly hangs off the back more than I would have imagined so maybe people are coming up on it and following too closely then being surprised? Putting cargo in it might be the fix.", "I think you should put flags on it to make it pop.", "How about fastening a mid-size box of some sort so that it appears you always have cargo on it?", "I am baffled. I have never heard anyone be snarky about a rack....  is it scary? Like does it have too much wiggle room. Does it do some odd shimmy-shake when you drive that makes it look like it is about to fall off?\n\nYou are going to have to get a mate to follow you and tell you what is up....????\n\nAre your bumper stickers metallic? If the sun is behind you do the flash and sparkle and blind?", "That's a good idea actually. Whether that solves the issue or not, idk. But I think it would look cool and add to my safe driving doctrine.", "Not a half bad idea. I'm sure I have some scrap wood I can fashion a crate out of.", "Would love to see the face of whoever keeps letting air out of the tires when they try to open it and get a glitter bomb. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "No, it's sturdy and sound. It's somewhat low profile but not enough for anyone to miss it. The reflectors aren't very reflective in the day time. More like fluorescent at night. Easy to see, easy on the eyes. Someone asked for a pic of it earlier. \n\nId be willing to ride on it on a bumpy freeway."]}
