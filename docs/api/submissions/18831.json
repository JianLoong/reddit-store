If his thinking was he\u2019ll get tickets and you get food that should\u2019ve been made clear. It\u2019s harder to say no on the spot and seems like he knows that and is capitalizing on it", "NTA. If he does this \u201casking to pay on the spot\u201d stuff a lot, then you need to learn to say no on the spot. My boyfriend and I discuss ahead of time who is paying for what date or which part of the date. If he won\u2019t bring it up ahead of time, bring it up yourself.", "NTA- it doesn't even matter about the fact that this was over a film you didn't want to see. What is concerning is that it is a pattern of behaviour that I'm guessing you've mentioned before and yet he continues to exhibit. \n\nIt comes down to trust. Can you trust that he won't do this again in the future? You went with the dignified route but you could have said that you currently don't have sufficient funds or embarrassed him at the concession stand and said you thought he'd taken you on a date. He is taking advantage of your politeness to manipulate the situation to his advantage. \n\nIt might be worth clearly communicating in the future when you plan an activity etc who is responsible for paying what. Just because you earn more doesn't mean that money is available to spend. If he realises that he can't manipulate a situation to his financial advantage because you've set out a clear budget he may get the message.", "Say two words.....\"HELL NO\". You can whisper it, if you want.", "If he keeps springing these surprise expectations for you to pay for him, he\u2019s obviously doing it intentionally.\n\nNext time he does it, refuse to pay for him. Hand him the cost of your ticket, or whatever it is, and tell him that \u201cthese outings are getting too expensive for me and I can\u2019t just keep dropping $30-40 for you without budgeting for it. You\u2019ll need to start paying for yourself and I\u2019ll just pay for myself.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not married. You\u2019re only dating. If he has a big objection to the idea of paying for himself, you\u2019ll find out immediately and can act accordingly. As it stands, you clearly are way ahead in the whole \u201cwho pays for who\u201d balance sheet, so he hasn\u2019t a leg to stand on.\n\nBTW I\u2019ve dated 3 of these guys who conveniently managed things so that I paid for most of our dates, and conveniently they felt EXTREMELY put upon at my insistence that they pay for themselves. Because that\u2019s what moochers do.", "NTA - I don't think it's good for him to spring that on you like that, especially if he was the one that invited you out.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you need to have a conversation with each other with good, open communication on what the expectations are. I'm old fashioned enough that I think guys generally should pay on dates, but I know that's a divisive issue, but wherever you fall on that issue, it should be talked about openly, so that it's not happening on a case-by-case basis and leading to hurt feelings.", "NTA. Firstly, there\u2019s no agreement on splitting the costs, or going dutch. \n\nSecondly, and a more personal opinion of mine, is that the person who insisted on a date (in OP\u2019s case) ought to be the one paying for everything unless there\u2019s an agreement on  splitting costs (see first point). \n\nIt is not fair for OP who is not keen on the movie or being in the cinema in the first place to pay for any part of it.", "Movie food is ALWAYS more expensive than the tickets.  That\u2019s quite the con.", "ESH\n\nYou both need to work on your communication skills. If you don\u2019t want to do something, don\u2019t. He can go with a friend.", "NTA - I cannot imagine asking someone to go somewhere with me knowing full well they would never choose to do this activity on their own and then expect them to pay for anything, let alone them AND me. The audacity of him blindsiding you and outright asking you to pay for him too is astounding and such a huge turn off. I don't know you but I'm pretty sure you can do better.", "You and he should definitely have some conversation on how to split date costs in a way you\u2019re both happy with. \n\nBut as for this date, once you agreed to go it was rude for you to keep dragging your feet on letting it be fun. You are not TA for wanting to pay equally or for your own items only, but you are TA for insisting that he should pay because you didn\u2019t really want to go at all.\n\nNext time, say no in the first place if you are not a willing participant. Or at least set the expectations and tell him you don\u2019t want to go, but you will if he pays for both of you.\n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But your question here implies that you primarily didn\u2019t want to pay a portion because you didn\u2019t like the date idea.\n\nWhat really matters though is that you and bf get on the same page with how costs are split.

You did this. You went with him. You paid for meal. Take responsibility for yourself and your actions, cause you can actually control that and make it better, while you can't do much about what he does other then tell him what you want and hope for the best. So control what you can control, your choices. Tell him clearly 'I pay for myself and only myself, tickets and food, on all dates from now on'.\n\nNTA though, maybe a bit oblivious how to set and uphold boundaries, but that's not being an asshole."]}
