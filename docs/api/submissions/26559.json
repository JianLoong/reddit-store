I went to see the baby when she was first born and I\u2019ve visited a few times since to see the baby. My brother lives about an hour away from me and I don\u2019t have too much free time to see them very often. I recently bought a house and have been working on renovating it on top of being a full time student and working full time. So not much free time in my schedule. \n\nThings were pretty chill during the first month or so of the baby\u2019s life since my brother was able to take time off to be home with the baby full time. My brother\u2019s girlfriend does not work, so she is also staying at home with the baby full time. Of course, my brother has had to return back to work and this has taken a toll on his girlfriend. She has been unable to take care of the baby by herself and has requested someone stay with her the whole duration of time my brother is at work. For a while, my mom would help out and stay with her. Then, her mother stepped in and stayed with her while my brother worked. Now, both are unavailable and my brother and his girlfriend are expecting me to stay over and help her take care of the baby. \n\nI do not feel that this is my responsibility. Especially when I am being called and asked to come over on extremely short notice. My brother works night shift, so these calls are coming at around 9-10PM.  I feel awful saying no but I have very limited time to myself and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to take care of their baby. My brother\u2019s girlfriend was adamant on having a baby even though many thought \u2014and still think\u2014 that she was not mature enough to have a baby. Now, she cannot take care of the baby by herself for more than 2 hours without calling someone and asking them to come help her. \n\nI hate it because I feel bad and start to worry for my niece and if she\u2019s being taken care of properly. Thought, at the same time, I truly don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal that someone needs to stay with her every single night while my brother is at work. Is this actually normal and I\u2019m being the a**hole? Or am I warranted in saying no?", "created_utc": 1694314227, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16eork0/aita_for_not_taking_care_of_my_niece/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is for your brother and his gf to figure out. They created this person. \n\nYou have a lot on your plate. Even if you had more free time, you're still not obligated to take care of this baby. What a terrible situation.", "NTA\n\nYour brother's GF is 22 years old.  She can take care of her own baby like the grown-ass adult that she is.\n\nI recommend that you set a Do Not Disturb for their phone numbers.  You don't need their last-minute calls for free childcare to interrupt your life.", "NTA\n\nPlease do not allow people to take your kindness for weakness. If she is unable to take proper care of their baby, they should come up with some type of plan (doula, daycare). Their baby is not your responsibility and do not allow them to guilt you into thinking that it is.", "NTA \n\nThis whole situation is a mess, but none of it is on you. \n\nShe is a young mother, scared, overwhelmed, clearly underprepared, and likely dealing with some kind of postpartum mental health issues. It is understandable that she is frazzled, however, that doesn\u2019t mean she gets to make massive demands of everyone else in her life. At the end of the day this is a decision she and your brother made, and it is their responsibility. And it sounds like they\u2019ve been very fortunate to have a lot of family support in these early months. \n\nI will say though, that maybe your brother should have been more thoughtful before making a life long commitment with someone 9 years younger than him, knowing perfectly well how mature she is, and that her own brain hasn\u2019t even finished developing. They both made this choice together, but one had a lot more maturity and life experience to work off of.", "NTA.  You have to live your life first.  Your SIL may have post partum issues and certainly may be overwhelmed.  Offer help when you can but explain you can't be there daily for hours at a time.  Good luck.", "NTA.\n\nI get that your brothers GF is scared, but the solution is not for female relatives to move in and stay with her round the clock so that she's not alone. \n\nIt might be tempting to write her and your brother off as lazy and entitled, but it may be that she's got post-natal depression.  Or perhaps she's just very young and realising now that having a baby isn't as easy as she thought it was going to be. Either way, it's not your job to be their overnight nanny. They need to seek some help and support and work on getting her more independent and confident as a parent.", "NTA.\n\nShe's a new mom, and she's still young. She's had help from your mom, her mom and your brother. I'm thinking she could potentially have post partum. You have a busy life. I'm sure those late hours are essential for you to go to bed at a decent time and get enough sleep. Don't blame yourself for being a working student with a home to maintain. You can help by just offering to help find someone who has the time to help care for the baby. But ultimately, your brother and his girlfriend need to figure this out. They can't keep relying on people every single night.", "The mom must be overwhelmed and tired, but that's what happens when you have a baby. If they're having trouble getting through the night, they can ask for help, but they can't demand it. You don't owe them your help, and it's not your baby they want you spending your nights looking after when you don't want to. That's the job of a parent or a nanny.\n\nThe parents knew that the father would be working nights and should have made arrangements accordingly. I assume that your brother works at night and sleeps during the day, so the mother looks after the baby a lot, but it's not your responsibility. They should figure it out.\n\nNTA", "Nta. This is not normal. Unless she is sick She can take care of her child at night by herself. She just doesn\u2019t want to. No better time than now to learn to take care of your child. Don\u2019t feel guilty. She should feel guilty.", "I will say that in the beginning it is scary taking care of a baby. I was so scared of doing anything wrong that might harm my baby. But the only way to learn is to do it. It is not your responsibility to stay with the gf. I think she\u2019s panicking because she\u2019s scared but she needs to learn to care for the baby herself. If they REALLY need someone there at all times, they can hire a nanny. Not your responsibility. NTA", "Sorry, NTA  \nShe chose to have a baby, she needs to learn how to handle being a mother. She needs to also realize it's okay to not be perfect at it. There will be times she needs to care for the child alone, that simple. If she wasn't ready for that, she shouldn't have had a kid.", "NTA. It isn't your responsibility. If you're concerned for your niece, offer a time to help that will work for you. Being a new parent is hard. There may be issues with post-partum depression. Try not to be upset by their sudden request, they are in over their heads and just realized it.\n\nEdit: And you might find that you enjoy the time to bond with your niece. Or maybe that's just me, I love babies.", "NTA sound like your sil have postpartum depression your brother should seek professional help for her. It not your responsible to take care of her what about your job your rent and all bills.", "NTA \n\nYou don't owe anybody child care.\nYou don't owe anybody your free time \nYou don't owe anybody assistance when it's going to make you uncomfortable and feel out of your depth.

Obviously none of us here know for sure whether or not she is suffering from PPD/PPA, but please keep in mind that when you say this behavior isn\u2019t \u201cnormal,\u201d that kind of behavior can absolutely be a symptom of PPD/PPA.  And if it is, that is not her fault.", "NTA-She sounds like she needs help which doesn\u2019t make her an asshole but automatically expecting you to step in last minute does.", "NTA.  You're right, this is not your responsibility.  They need to find a better answer than you.", "NTA. I had my first one at 22. I'd never changed a diaper before.

It's been a few months and if she can't cope, she needs professional help and probably should've got it earlier.  \n\nIs there a history of anxiety or other mental health stuff in the past?  The first time it presents could be PND but sometimes you find a previous history.\n\nIt sounds like she would benefit from a stay at a mother and baby unit.  Both to address any mental health and also learn some parenting skills.  There is always a nurse there to help.  But they will be running programs during the day too.  She may need a longer stay than just a few days too.", "Nta if she can't take care of her kid wtf have it", "If you didn't give birth to it, you have no obligation to it.\n\nTell your brother you're not able to babysit and suggest they look into hiring a nanny. Don't answer questions as to why you're not available, just tell them you aren't able to be a caregiver, and then stop responding. Gf is literally unemployed, there's no reason she can't look after HER OWN CHILD THAT SHE HAD ON PURPOSE.", "NTA, she is a mother and needs to act like one.  The baby is a few months old; she has healed physically to the point she can care for her child.  Unless she is suffering from PPD she should be able care for her child overnight without help.  Bluntly if she cannot care for the child more than a few hours on her own CPS needs to be contacted for the protection of the child.", "NTA but, if the baby is a rough sleeper, it seems very normal to me that she might need help at night. It\u2019s hard to care for an infant all night by yourself. People do it, but it\u2019s hard.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m wondering if she has PPD or has had a rough recovery, as those things can make it much harder to care for a baby solo.\n\nSo you\u2019re totally free and fair to say no, but I wouldn\u2019t judge her for asking/needing help", "NTA. This adult woman can't look after her own baby for more than a couple of hours unaided?! That's literally her job now.", "NTA.

Maybe she should\u2019ve thought about how much work a baby is before she had one. Perhaps your brother should hire someone to come in a few hours a day to teach her how to care for her own child. \n\nWhat your mom and her mom were doing was way more than babysitting. If your brother can\u2019t afford to hire someone, maybe he can have both mothers come over and teach her how to take care of her child properly. Without running to someone for help all the time. Best of luck to you.", "Nta.\nShe needs to learn to have the baby on her own. Maybe she does have post partum and needs treating too.

HE is neglectful of HIS child and its mother in his own household. There's more to being a parent and partner than abdicating his DUTY to see his child is supported and safe because he has work, so too bad, someone else has to step in where he should, but won't. She may also be immature and unprepared. But right now she's a new mother in distress daily and he's using guilting his family as a band aid while ignoring this huge threat to the safety and health of his partner and child. HE needs to take her to her doctor NOW.", "Nta. They chose to have a baby, you didn't.

If people keep running to save her she\u2019ll never learn she can do it.  Im pretty new to the term but I\u2019m fairly sure this is an example of weaponized incompetence.", "NTA.

That is an unrealistic distance to expect someone to come help at 9 or 10pm, especially after working all day. \n\nIf she is struggling this badly when the baby should be on a routine schedule by now and it\u2019s at night while the brother is working, there\u2019s two possibilities \n\n1) She is truly struggling and may need evaluated for PPD and/or PPA\n\n2) She didn\u2019t put a lot of thought into what is actually involved in taking care of a baby and just wants to sleep at night (what new parent doesn\u2019t) and have someone else get up with the baby every few hours. \n\nBut to expect OP to work and do school all day, drive an hour at 9pm, stay the night, get up every few hours with the baby (either feeding or just from the baby crying), drive an hour in the morning to go to work/school the next day and then do it all over again is beyond ridiculous.", "What if she is 'sick? Post-partum depression and 'baby blues' are very real issues.", "But OP is not responsible for figuring that out and definitely isn't an AH because she can't babysit them.", "And if she is sick, she needs to be treated.
