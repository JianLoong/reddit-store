I went to see the baby when she was first born and I\u2019ve visited a few times since to see the baby. My brother lives about an hour away from me and I don\u2019t have too much free time to see them very often. I recently bought a house and have been working on renovating it on top of being a full time student and working full time. So not much free time in my schedule. \n\nThings were pretty chill during the first month or so of the baby\u2019s life since my brother was able to take time off to be home with the baby full time. My brother\u2019s girlfriend does not work, so she is also staying at home with the baby full time. Of course, my brother has had to return back to work and this has taken a toll on his girlfriend. She has been unable to take care of the baby by herself and has requested someone stay with her the whole duration of time my brother is at work. For a while, my mom would help out and stay with her. Then, her mother stepped in and stayed with her while my brother worked. Now, both are unavailable and my brother and his girlfriend are expecting me to stay over and help her take care of the baby. \n\nI do not feel that this is my responsibility. Especially when I am being called and asked to come over on extremely short notice. My brother works night shift, so these calls are coming at around 9-10PM.  I feel awful saying no but I have very limited time to myself and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to take care of their baby. My brother\u2019s girlfriend was adamant on having a baby even though many thought \u2014and still think\u2014 that she was not mature enough to have a baby. Now, she cannot take care of the baby by herself for more than 2 hours without calling someone and asking them to come help her. \n\nI hate it because I feel bad and start to worry for my niece and if she\u2019s being taken care of properly. Thought, at the same time, I truly don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal that someone needs to stay with her every single night while my brother is at work.

What a terrible situation.", "NTA\n\nYour brother's GF is 22 years old.

It is understandable that she is frazzled, however, that doesn\u2019t mean she gets to make massive demands of everyone else in her life. At the end of the day this is a decision she and your brother made, and it is their responsibility. And it sounds like they\u2019ve been very fortunate to have a lot of family support in these early months. \n\nI will say though, that maybe your brother should have been more thoughtful before making a life long commitment with someone 9 years younger than him, knowing perfectly well how mature she is, and that her own brain hasn\u2019t even finished developing. They both made this choice together, but one had a lot more maturity and life experience to work off of.", "NTA.  You have to live your life first.  Your SIL may have post partum issues and certainly may be overwhelmed.  Offer help when you can but explain you can't be there daily for hours at a time.

Or perhaps she's just very young and realising now that having a baby isn't as easy as she thought it was going to be. Either way, it's not your job to be their overnight nanny. They need to seek some help and support and work on getting her more independent and confident as a parent.", "NTA.\n\nShe's a new mom, and she's still young. She's had help from your mom, her mom and your brother. I'm thinking she could potentially have post partum. You have a busy life. I'm sure those late hours are essential for you to go to bed at a decent time and get enough sleep. Don't blame yourself for being a working student with a home to maintain. You can help by just offering to help find someone who has the time to help care for the baby. But ultimately, your brother and his girlfriend need to figure this out. They can't keep relying on people every single night.", "The mom must be overwhelmed and tired, but that's what happens when you have a baby. If they're having trouble getting through the night, they can ask for help, but they can't demand it. You don't owe them your help, and it's not your baby they want you spending your nights looking after when you don't want to. That's the job of a parent or a nanny.\n\nThe parents knew that the father would be working nights and should have made arrangements accordingly.

Don\u2019t feel guilty. She should feel guilty.", "I will say that in the beginning it is scary taking care of a baby. I was so scared of doing anything wrong that might harm my baby. But the only way to learn is to do it. It is not your responsibility to stay with the gf. I think she\u2019s panicking because she\u2019s scared but she needs to learn to care for the baby herself.

She needs to also realize it's okay to not be perfect at it. There will be times she needs to care for the child alone, that simple.

Being a new parent is hard. There may be issues with post-partum depression. Try not to be upset by their sudden request, they are in over their heads and just realized it.\n\nEdit: And you might find that you enjoy the time to bond with your niece.
