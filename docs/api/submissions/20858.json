{"id": 20858, "submission_id": "14lq6d7", "title": "AITA for telling my friend that his comments about his daughter make me uncomfortable?", "selftext": "One of my (42F) friends (38M) became a dad two years ago. We are not very close, talk occasionally, but generally like one another and enjoy our time when we hang out. His daughter is a sweet little thing, and is adorable like all little babies are. He loves her, and is always gushing about her. However, he makes comments about how pretty she is that I find really uncomfortable. \n\nHe\u2019ll say things like, \u201cShe\u2019s going to have a hard time when she grows up with boys hitting on her\u201d and, \u201cI\u2019m really worried about when she grows up because boys won\u2019t leave her alone\u201d, etc. I find this extremely uncomfortable and weird because she\u2019s just a baby - why on earth is he thinking about her as a sexual being years from now, let alone thinking about her sexually anyway at any age? I\u2019ve tried to get him to stop by saying things like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to think about something that far in the future\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll grow up to be strong and will be able to handle those situations well.\u201d But the comments haven\u2019t stopped. \n\nI suppose I could have just ignored it, but I told him that I was uncomfortable with such comments and explained why I think these are inappropriate comments. He freaked out, told me I was screwed up to think that he was thinking about his daughter that way, and I\u2019m pretty certain the friendship is now over. \n\nEdit: I just want to clarify that I do not in any way think that he is having sexual thoughts about himself and his daughter. The inappropriateness I am referring to is about his comments about her future sexual experiences with others. I would find it just as inappropriate if he made comments about his son causing girls to hit on him in the future.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m seeing a lot of comments that say, \u201cHe didn\u2019t sexualize it, you did.\u201d This is difficult for me to understand because he\u2019s the one who talked about her potentially being sexually harassed in the future. It would not have even occurred to me to look at a baby and think, \u201cshe\u2019s going to be sexually harassed in the future\u201d. So, if you are leaving me a comment saying I\u2019m the one who sexualized it, please explain why you think so because I\u2019m genuinely trying to understand this. It is utterly flabbergasting me because in my mind, that would never have even occurred to me if his comments didn\u2019t express worry for her future sexual well being.", "created_utc": 1687998906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lq6d7/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_his_comments/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Shocked to see so many saying YTA, but hey. Reddit.\n\nIt's really inappropriate for him to be so consumed by these thoughts of what her sexual life will be like when she's older. His focus on her physical beauty is really not what you want to see in a father and it will likely progress through her life to controlling actions and comments. He doesn't seem to see her as a separate entity from himself but more as a beautiful anthropomorphic item to watch evolve. While I believe you should be glad the friendship is over because it's unlikely this man views women holistically, it's really unfortunate that his daughter will be raised in such an objectifying environment.", "Unpopular opinion but NTA\n\nThere's a difference between gushing over how cute your kid is, and talking about them being so attractive that they are concerned for them. Is it an alarm bell for the dad? Not really, our society tends to do this a lot, but that doesn't mean it's appropriate.\n\nThe whole \"my kid is a heartbreaker! Back off ladies!!\" style onesies you can get are fucking weird.\n\nYou're allowed to find something uncomfortable, and you are allowed to request someone doesn't continue doing/saying something. That's kinda the bottom line here.", "NTA. I agree with you. Those are inappropriate comments and I'd find them creepy too. Someone needed to tell him what he was sounding like.", "NTA, this type of thing is something queer people have discussed because it is very common for parents to romanticize or sexualize their children. It is not often seen as problematic but if you were to say the same kind of thing in a queer context people would suddenly find it to be very fucked up. It is a harmful part of the cishet/patriarchal culture. I think you were right to say that it isn\u2019t something he needs to dwell on and that you\u2019re sure she will grow to be a strong and intelligent person who can hopefully navigate situations successfully herself. The whole overprotective father thing is tired. Hopefully he starts thinking more about what types of thoughts he\u2019s been having about his daughter that leads him to saying these kinds of things more deeply. It would be way more beneficial for him to just be a loving and supportive father and make sure to give her all the information she needs to make the best choices for herself than to be like \u201cmy daughter is going to struggle with attention from men and probably suffer at the hands of them because she\u2019s a woman\u201d\u2026", "NTA. He's going to be that idiot dad who says threatening things to any guy who she goes out with when she's a teenager..", "NTA- you were uncomfortable with something and voiced your own feelings about it. He is the one who flipped out and flew off the handle instead of respecting your boundaries and not making the comments when talking to you.", "I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a cultural difference here that makes you NTA. This is the kind of basic ass throwaway thing that people in the UK say about babies all the time. It\u2019s steeped in misogyny at lot of the time, and old fashioned ideas of what it means to be a parent to a girl vs a boy. \n\nMy friend from Colombia once got really upset when someone suggested her baby was \u201cgoing to be a heart breaker\u201d and it was only then I realised that it was kind of a weird local idiom.\n\nIn reality though, that dad is so super proud and doesn\u2019t know how to express the feeling of utter love he gets when he looks at his baby. So, he defaults to these lame expressions he\u2019s heard other men say. The true crime here is his lack of original thought.\n\nEdit to remove \u201cyou might be TA\u201d", "NTA. I don't see that you're \"sexualizing\" anything. It's just plain weird to have someone speculate about their baby daughter being \"hit on\" in the future.\n\nPlus I think the fact that he reacted so defensively confirms he was laying it on pretty thick.\n\nI would prob have made a smart alecky remark like, \"Oh, I don't know, lots of cute babies grow up to be really ugly adults!\" That might've shut him up.", "NTA. He was likely thinking of her as property he'll need to protect from other men sexualizing her, which is not exactly the same as sexualizing her himself, but not much better.", "NAH I think you probably meant well and while there is some truth that if kids grow up hearing too much of those kind of comments and not enough other feedback about their worth as a person that can have an effect on their self image that they are only valued for their looks or sexuality etc BUT there\u2019s no evidence at this point that that\u2019s the case here, he\u2019s just saying pretty typical stuff people say about kids to convey that they are cute and smart etc. \n\nAs a parent, of course your dreams for your child is that their life is going to be perfect, and they are going to have everything they want, and because looks and money do have more value in this world than we might want them to, then, regardless of how much we want to instill other values in them or change the way the world treats people, we are still going to secretly hope that our child has all of the beauty and money and health in the world that will give them the best possible future.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not weird at all for a parent to be thinking of their child in future, as soon as you have a kid you are envisioning their whole future life and making decisions that will impact them later. For example, choosing whether or not to circumcise a son. \n\nSince you state that you aren\u2019t very close to this person, in general it would have been good advice not to make any comments about his parenting, unless you feel that the child is in danger, like if he had been drinking heavily while with you and then about to drive home with the kid in the car.", "NTA, you were uncomfortable about those comments and told him why they made you uncomfortable you are allowed to do that. If he was a good friend he would respect you enough to not make those comments around you and tell them to other people but he didn't so he is a jerk here.", "YTA. I have a son and a daughter. My son is cute (if I do say do myself lol) and I get a LOT of \u201che\u2019s gonna do well with the girls when he gets older\u201d comments about him.\n\nIt\u2019s literally the same thing here as you\u2019re complaining about. I also have made similar comments about both my kids when talking to other parents (mostly around the theme of what a headache them dating is gonna be lol) and there\u2019s nothing sexual or creepy about it.", "NTA. If someone was saying the same thing about the baby liking the same gender or something ppl would probably find a problem with that \ud83d\ude44 but it IS weird to think about his baby daughter dating when she\u2019s just a baby \ud83d\ude2d kids wouldn\u2019t feel so pressured with expectations and stuff like that if parents didn\u2019t feel the need to make such weird ass comments", "NTA\nThis is about as gross as Trump talking about how he would bang his daughter. Like why is he talking about how attractive a baby is and will be to adults later? So gross", "Don\u2019t read too much into it. You seem like you may be a person who takes things too literally. This is how traditional guys talk about their daughter being beautiful. The boys will be beating our door down. The last thing on their minds is sexual harassment. It\u2019s GOOD in their minds for their daughter to  be attractive to men. And it\u2019s always a future projection. \n\nFor boys sometimes it\u2019s \u201che\u2019s such a handsome little guy, the girls are going to be lining up!\u201d\n\nEveryone wants to think their kid will be beautiful and socially successful", "YTA, that's a really weird way to be thinking about a child. Your friend is likely going through the stage that all fathers do with their daughters, especially first time fathers and especially in this day and age when people know how fucked up other people can be.\n\nHe hasn't sexualised anything. You have.", "NTA. I think its weird too. But its also very common among people in the US where I live.(edit, especially among straight people) I don't think it clicks what the implications are when they say stuff like that. \n\nThat's not even getting into the effects such comments have on the children once they understand  what's being said. \n\nI'd say maybe have a gentle conversation with your friend and maybe explain that you meant no offense.", "NTA the comments he was making were totally inappropriate and weird. I think any person talking about kid like that is weird and just enforces the fucked up beauty standards/rape culture our society has. I think you did the right thing, he just may have misinterpreted what you said and thought you were accusing him of being attracted to his daughter or something gross like that. Men not calling out other men for inappropriate comments or behavior only perpetuates the fucked up rape culture in our society. I don\u2019t think the friend meant any harm with these comments but he won\u2019t learn that those comments are inherently harmful if no one tells him", "NTA it bothers me when people say this shit about my daughter as well, she is only 9 months old and still in diapers. Or worse, men saying she's \"flirting\" with them, because she smiled. \ud83e\udd2e", "YTA  \nThose comments don't sound like he's thinking of his daughter as a sexual being.   \nWhat it sounds like is thinking about his teenage years, thinking about maybe how he was back then, and how people he knew were back then and having a daughter has put those behaviours into perspective for the first time.", "I think a lot of people make those comments about how \"she'll be a heartbreaker\" or \"the boys will be all over her\" without it being sexual in their minds. I don't see elementary crushes as sexual, more cutesy. These statements can be cutesy when being described by a child. I don't consider this wishing or thinking about sexual harassment at all when making these statements.\n\nSo look at it like this: A kindergartener comes home and says she has a crush on her classmate. I think, \"Aw that's cute.\" And I think that this kid probably thinks the boy is nice looking and she wants to share a cookie with him at lunch or play tag with him at recess. (Cutesy). You make a comment about how she is too young to have s3x and that kindergarteners shouldn't be (insert graphic detail). I am going to be disturbed by your comment and I am going to be shocked that you would even go there. For that reason soft YTA because I think you were trying to be protective of the child, but ... yeah, no.", "That's creepy and NTA.\n\nSimilar story, my BIL was over with my sister (they have no kids). I have a picture of my son's class on the fridge. He's looking at it and says, \"let's see which ones are going to grow up to be sluts.\" They are 2nd graders... \ud83e\udd2e\n\nEdit: Nobody likes my BIL.", "Yeah a family friend used to say that about me and then SA me when I was 4.  \n\nNTA", "I think it would be good to consider the following. A perspective is not black or white.\n\nThe dads worry about his daughter's future boyfriends can come from anywhere. Maybe he has seen close up how young women can be treated and doesn't want that for his daughter. Him worrying about that now, might be seen as a little extreme, but it's a legit thing to be worried about.\n\nThat does not immediately mean he is sexualizing his daughter. He obviously dotes on her. He doesn't want bad things to happen to her. His perspective on this is coloured by his experiences and obviously he is already thinking about how to deal with the future heartbreak and yes, sex life of his kid. It's not easy for some parents to see your child get hurt, but in most cases it's unavoidable.\n\nMaybe ask him what his worries are exactly about? Maybe he is just searching for ways to guide his daughter safely into those kinds of situations but doesn't have a clue how to go about it. At what age do you talk to your kid about safe sex? How do you teach them to protect their boundaries? How do you make sure that if anything happens, you, as a parent, will be the one they come running to so you can help?\n\nAll of the above are in my opinion realistic concerns that can be pretty daunting. His little girl is his world. He sees her innocence and dislikes the thought of that being damaged. Maybe instead of telling him to shut up about it and imply he is sexualising her, try to help him figure out what to do in some scenarios. Help him be a good dad?\n\nI'm withholding judgement because I hope you can get some more insight in why he is worried and maybe instead of letting your perspective getting in the way, offer a helping hand.", "Idk, I get his side and your side. I pretty much feel the same way about my daughter. Blonde hair, blue eyes, and the attitude of Beth Dutton. She is absolutely the most beautiful person in the world to me. I know what I was like when I was a teen, though, and I expect that other teen boys will be the same way with her. I'm not sexualizing her in any way, but I do know others will, and I will have to watch out for her as a father. Mine is only 6, but I dread the day she is 16.", "YTA, instead of lecturing this dad enamored by his daughter maybe take a few steps back? Yes it could end up that he will be a problematic father, but it's a hell of a lot more likely that he adores his baby girl and is saying things that are truly harmless but you've decided to take offense to! You are sexualizing his comments by assuming that he's anything other than concerned about her future in the world. If that's still too difficult for you to understand then get thee to therapy NOW!!!", "Uh YTA for saying he was having \u201cinappropriate thoughts about his daughter\u201d and expecting him to react in literally any other way tbh.

From what you've written here, nothing your friend said was creepy or unusual.", "YTA. You are the one who sexualized it. What he\u2019s saying is similar to the old saying about daddy needing a shotgun to keep the boys away. \n\nI didn\u2019t interpret any of that as future sexual experiences.", "YTA.  Parents think about the future of their kids, especially new parents.  He wasn't sexualizing his kid, just sorting out various scenarios.  That's what parents do.  You were the one sexualizing it.

I agree that those comments are inappropriate and odd, however, I think you should\u2019ve expected that kind of response after confronting him with the word \u201csexualizing\u201d. It definitely is a form of sexualizing a child, but I think anyone who was confronted with the use of that word would view it as extremely accusatory. You could\u2019ve worded it in a better way. Maybe something like, \u201cHey honestly those comments make me uncomfortable because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s super appropriate to talk about people being attracted to your daughter in the future when she is just a baby right now. I understand that you don\u2019t intend any harm by those comments, but it could come off the wrong way to some people.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that would be any good either, but it\u2019s something.", "YTA.

She works hard. She\u2019s mastered crawling, whatever. Although she doesn\u2019t understand any of it yet, it\u2019s better to build that muscle memory early since for years you\u2019ll always look at your kids and think \u201cahhh they\u2019re so freakin cute I can\u2019t stand it\u201d.\n\nThat would\u2019ve been a really good reason to stop, your reason was weird and cringe.", "YTA. He meant she was going to be popular and happy. You can argue that it's a pretty low goal to just be found physically attractive, but parents say this stuff because it's their hope.

I\u2019ve tried to get him to stop by saying things like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to think about something that far in the future\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll grow up to be strong and will be able to handle those situations well.\u201d But the comments haven\u2019t stopped. \n\nI suppose I could have just ignored it, but I told him that I was uncomfortable with such comments and explained why I think these are inappropriate comments.

Alternatively she will know she can't trust her father to understand her developing sexuality as she grows up and will behave secretly around sex and relationships with men.
