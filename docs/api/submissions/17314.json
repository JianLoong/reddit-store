It's not necessary.  If Grandma had put some effort into her son, he probably wouldn't be like this.

This man likely doesn't even understand what the problem is, and probably never will. Even if he was able to understand that what he said was rude, he might not be able to stop doing it because he lacks a filter, and even if he's able to realize that he should apologize after saying certain things, he might not have the self awareness to realize that he's said something he shouldn't have or be able to pick up on the fact that what he said upset people.", "The grand irony of human biology is that the very organ we use to understand the world is so complex as to be barely understandable by us.", "Brain injury or not, it sounds like OP's uncle is doing a good job of burning bridges, too.

He has a lot more tolerance for those things now because he knows what will happen if he acts up. Now I don't get mad at him, he can't help it if he gets so overwhelmed that he has a meltdown but since he was little I taught him how to cope, it was never the rest of the worlds problem.
