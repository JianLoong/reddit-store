Not actually a brain injury (what even is the possibility of a brain injury that ONLY makes someone a asshole)\n\nIf the behavior is actually because of a brain injury. Why does he or anyone else not have medical proof of it or any medicine to manage it. and if he actually does have a medical condition of being an offensive asshole. Why does anyone willingly bring/invite him to social gatherings knowing he will ruin the experience for everyone else?\n\nTldr\n\nHes either is lying about the injury to be an asshole on purpose or the family hasn't stood up to him being an asshole on purpose making him think its acceptable", "Agreed. NTA.", "Yep, OP\u2019s dad is a colossal AH.", "My husband has a brain injury from work a decade ago. He worked HARD to get his anger under control and NOT be a huge asshole. It took a long time, and a lot of work, but he did it. He also had other things as a result of the injury, both physical and neurological to deal with.\n\nThere's no way that uncle is a perfectly functioning adult in every other way, and the brain injury *only* makes affects him so he can't not be an asshole.\n\nNTA.", "The only thing my brain injury gets me out of is driving and remembering birthdays", "NTA breaking toxic cycles can be tough", "If he really had a TBI he literally can\u2019t help it", "NTA. Uncle can toe the line or stay TF gone. Life's too short to have to deal with Uncle A Hole.", "You really don\u2019t know if uncle is an asshole??", "This is not to say people with conditions shouldn't be reasonably accommodated. But this definitely isn't reasonable.", "This dude literally has spent over a decade being the biggest asshole on the planet to anything that breaths. Why are you defending someone reaching break point.", "Here, I quoted what he *actually* said.\n\n>I was not quiet. I'm pretty sure everyone in my back yard could hear me telling him to behave like a fucking civilized adult.\n\nYou can raise your voice to someone without screaming at them.  When you're outside, sound carries a long way.  I can hear someone talking normally in my front yard from my back yard. If they raise their voice a bit I can fully make out what they're saying.  Screaming, meanwhile, is generally understood to mean \"yelling as loudly as possible.\" So why would you immediately interpret that statement in the most extreme manner possible?", "Brain injuries can cause disinhibition, personality changes, and more, but if you've lived with a brain injury since adolescence, you've had plenty of time to learn social norms. I'm glad you got him out.", "It's time for a real man to stand by her. Brain damage is on my cheek.", "I bet dad thought that by inviting the uncle to OP's house, he could circumvent his wife and \"host\"/spend more time with his brother again by having all the family events at OP's house. Like \"sorry wife, I can't control who OP allows to come, if you want to see your son you'll put up with Uncle\"", "This uncle is a clown that has been trained to put on a show for his family. They \\*LOVE\\* watching him do this shit, that's why they keep inviting him and taking his side. He is putting on a show and his brother and family are the audience.", "nuclear but honestly necessary.", "Not even nuclear tbh, this just seems like a very firm but also very fair and straightforward demand.", "It's not even the nuclear option, OPs father straight up disrespected him, his gf, and their new home.\n\nThe nuclear option is to never speak to the father again.", "Damage to the frontal lobe can impede all sorts of higher order thinking such as the ability to filter speech. Imagine how much of an asshole you'd be if you couldn't stop yourself from saying anything that popped into your head.", "You can't medicate your way out of brain damage.", ">Why does he or anyone else not have medical proof of it or any medicine to manage it\n\nThere's no indication that there's no medical evidence. It's not something you'd take along to a family dinner", "There are compensations he could make that would prevent his rude behavior.\n\nIf this were from a TBI, it was likely damage to a frontal lobe affecting his impulse control. This type of damage can \"remove the filter\" that stops bad behavior. Since his bad behavior is limited to making rude comments, he could compensate by staying quiet and not making any comments until he's well thought them out.\n\nHis family allowing him to just act on his impulses are not helping him.", "People with TBI can learn to manage their triggers and function socially. Very few are beyond  growth, especially for a childhood TBI that is still making him act this way as an adult. Most people with TBI are absolutely just as accountable for working within the constraints of their abilities to function in normal social interactions.", "Absolutely false. People with TBIs can seek behavioral treatment just like anyone else. They can use coping strategies just like anyone else.  The entire field of neuropsychology actually exists.", "Nah. And if OP's father is saying \"he has been like this forever\", then the TBI is just a cover for being an asshole.", "I had an uncle like this. He was a complete ass to everyone. He got coddled by my dear grandma because she somehow felt responsible (there was never a clear diagnosis, but they thought maybe something during birth) My grandma was in the hospital and couldn\u2019t care for him for about a month and my mom had to step in. When he realized she wouldn\u2019t take his abuse and still help him, guess who could miraculously be civil?", "If he really had it he would apologize", "It also seems like his parents didn't try to get him any help as a child of it did happen. They probably were like \"oh, he hit his head. We can't get mad at him\" and then continued to allow him to act out. Saying things like \"why are you with such a loser?\" Isn't a normal TBI thing. People with TBI don't go around at 50 years old telling people at a wedding the bride must be pregnant or judging the way the groom looks.", "People with TBIs get help managing their outbursts so they can function in the world. Even if he truly cannot help it, it does not mean he is entitled to shit over everyone because he is disabled. He can stay at home and offend his mother.", "If he actually has a brain injury that stops him from filtering (a real possibility) than no. It\u2019s the family that refuses to do anything to protect him and others who are the assholes", "At least the narrative of the family is that he doesn't know better. The father does. The uncle is an AH but for the purposes of this sub, maybe not TA.", "We have no idea if he actually has a brain injury that would affect his behavior. Original commenter is probably just erring on the side of caution.", "Do you not understand what ESH means?", "I mean you can't really learn your way out of disinhibition, that is kinds of the problem, but the fact that the uncle is not in any way apologetic is strong evidence that he is just an AH.", "So my sons mothers step father got hit by a drunk driver years ago - got brain damaged. \n\nTurned him from a loving family man into a violent alcoholic. He killed himself last year after burning every single bridge in his life. \n\nThey really dont understand the brain as much as everyone thinks - it\u2019s quite the assumption to think he\u2019s just putting it on", "It would be appropriate for him to have rehab or treatment for it then. Or lessons to not think offensive stuff all the time.", "You would probably get really good at apologizing for your conduct. Weird that this guy doesn't seem to have done that.", "Thats not what i meant. I mean lowering the impact the injury has on his life", "I don\u2019t want to appear as if I\u2019m wishing violence on the uncle, but what if he says the wrong thing to the wrong person? There are many people out there who are not as forgiving as op and more unstable than uncle.", "Even if he really has no inhibition due to a brain injury, that does not mean he can't understand that he should apologize after the fact. The fact that there are no apologies is a strong indicator he is an AH, regardless of whether he has a brain injury or not.", "A brain injury could potentially be reason for why he can't control it, but I cannot think of a way it would be the reason he doesn't know any better. The fact that he is not apologetic after the fac just means he is an asshole.", "Well, we have the guys mom saying he had one, and OP wasn\u2019t alive for their uncles whole life. Safe to say he probably had SOMETHING happen.", "I'm disagreeing with you. I know what it means.", "Yeah you can't learn in the same way someone on the spectrum might intellectually learn to recognize social cues even if it doesn't come naturally.\n\nBut in that case the family should have myriad strategies for addressing his behavior - go-to reprimands, taking him out of the situation, not expecting him to socialize with people who don't know him, distractions, meds even. They shouldn't just be letting him spray his asshole energy all over a social gathering.", "No matter if he is putting it on or not, it doesn't become OP's responsibility to put up with it in their own home.", "Yeah no. Most TBIs you can't lower this kind of impact.", "Exactly. His family that continue to just let it go are being negligent.", "That is a pretty fair point. It can also point to his family simply enabling that behavior for so long that he really doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s wrong.", "Brain damage can do a lot. If you don\u2019t believe you have anything to apologize for, you won\u2019t apologize. Nor should you tbh. An apology that is only done as a social cue isn\u2019t really an apology.\n\nShould someone apologize for calling someone a racist in their own home? Well, if the person did some racist stuff, then probably not, even if the host is offended. Doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be asked to leave."]}
