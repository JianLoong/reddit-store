You did all that could be expected and more, under the circumstances. \n\nHowever, if your friend never used to experience cramping and now she does, she should tell her doctor. Something may have changed. I doubt she\u2019ll get whatever it is properly treated, though.", "NTA\n\nYou WERE supportive. \nShe exceeded the amount of complaining that is permitted while refusing to try to address the problem. \n\nIf she'd accepted your suggestions and offers of help,  she would have been allowed to keep yammering a little longer (until the advil started doing its thing & the heat worked its soothing magic) but as it is, she didn't want to address the problem,  so any complaints beyond the initial conversation fall into the category of pointless whining. \n\nSide note- when this was still an issue in my life,  I found that *pressure* helped- laying face down with a small,  firm pillow under my belly or reclining with a 5 to 10 pound weight on my belly- especially if the weight was on top of the heating pad. \n\nHerbal teas with catnip and/or hops are also helpful but also make you drowsy, so only in the evening.", "NTA. I was initially leaning N A H, but what solidifies her as an asshole is when she starts to say that OP could never understand and that you weren\u2019t supportive. You tried to be supportive in every way you knew how, and you even offered her a heating pad when she didn\u2019t want to take meds.", "NTA. some people don't want medication in their body and that's fine. but you offered a heating pad as well and tried to be helpful. she still refused, she just wanted to bitch at you about how you'd never understand and talk about how annoyed she was about it? absolutely not. you can complain or vent, but you can't do it constantly without doing anything to help yourself.", "NTA either take meds if it\u2019s so bad no one will understand or shut the fuck up. You did the right thing", "NTA. Good heavens I was in college when ibuprofen became over the counter and we were so thrilled to finally have something that tended to work for cramps.", "NAH - Rarely does this sub have a post about a true philosophical question but this one does:    \nIs someone entitled to support when they refuse to take commonly used steps to reduce their suffering?  \n\n\nThe friend is not an AH for refusing medication.  Her reasoning is not explained but I don't see how it matters.  \n\n\nSo is OP an AH for being unsupportive to her friend because the friend isn't taking action to improve her situation?  I'm going to say no since it's a reasonable expectation that someone takes action to improve their situation instead of just complaining.", "NTA- you have done what you can and she is actively refusing to help herself. It is entirely possible that she\u2018s not able to take meds but warm compress and a warm (to hot) bath are options too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not obligated to be an audience to her complaining- shes not in mortal danger and rather dismissive of you.   \n\n\nPeople who whine about period pain while doing nothing fall under the category of self inflicted whiners - t.hey get no sympathy from me.", "NTA. Some people seem to buy into an idiotic concept that pain meds, etc are unnatural and suffering is good. Suffering isn\u2019t noble. It\u2019s just suffering. These people are so damn annoying. If she\u2019s not doing anything to help herself, you\u2019re more than within your rights to tell her to stop her whining.", "NAH sometimes people just want to complain about their pain.", "This is a hard one. I don't take meds for my cramps either. And just because you get period cramps, it doesn't mean that yours are as bad. Mine weren't horrible and life disrupting until my late 20s. I'm going with YTA because you could have just stopped responding to the complaints. Some people feel better by moaning and groaning out loud when they're in extreme pain.", "ESH\n\nYour friend sucks for not even trying a pain medication and continuing to complain BUT\n\nThere is a also a chance she has something like endometriosis which is really challenging and far more painful than a random general medication can handle.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Tell her to drink whole milk if she has cramps or start drinking it regularly. No idea why, but it takes cramps away.\n\nI'm not an expert but when my period was acting up I went to the doctor.", "NTA.
