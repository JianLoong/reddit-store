Reason I ask is because most people don't typically refuse medication without a reason and if it was that bad for her, there may be un underlying issue that she may not even know about.\n\nIn my own personal experience, I suffer with Endometriosis (i need surgery every few years) and it's debilitating for me, I'm barely able to get out of bed when the pain is really bad but i also used to work in addiction recovery support and handled medication in healthcare jobs (also have a few friends whos parents had munchusen biproxy so they'd been abused and forced to take all kinds of medication they didn't need and hospital trips with diagnosis they didn't really have) Because of my knowledge of medication I'm super cautious about taking pain meds and only take them when i can't cope anymore. I don't even use heat pads or hot water bottles anymore because I used to use them so often I burnt my stomach and doctor told me I needed to stop before I caused serious damage to myself.\n\nI understand it was hard and why you lost your patience but there may be more going on that you or her don't know about", "YTA - she could have endometriosis or something or even just deals with pain by making noise. \n\nAlso you're her friend and travelled with her but don't know her views on medication and stuff?

If they don't want to try any of those things, i don't know what they want you to do. And telling you you'll never understand, when almost every woman older than 12 goes through this is pretty rude.\n\nP.S Hot Tea is a personal favorite. Usually herbal, there's some scientific evidence that too much caffeine can worsen cramps, so ginger lemon or hibiscus is what I'll pick.", "NTA. I couldn\u2019t have handled that either.

If she wasn't going to do anything about it, why complain.", "She can be on something that doesn't mix with the painkillers you had (like antidepressants) and might not want to share.  I'm surprised she refused the heat pad, perhaps she doesn't get that really helps? You were very accommodating in my opinion offering both medication and non-medications solutions. I both understand how you wanted her to shup up and that she wanted to keep complaining. What I don't get is why she'd rather be in pain than doing anything about it.", "NTA.  Why does she allow herself to suffer like that.  If she gets it like that, she needs to see a doctor.  I have had it so severe one time, I couldn't sit or move.  It was horrible.  Tell her to take medication such as three to four advil which is a prescription strength for pain relief.  She can also try Midol.", "If your friend doesn't typically have such bad cramps, is it possible she was experiencing an early miscarriage? If she knew that's what was happening, or that it was a possibility, that could have made her even crankier than just the pain itself. \n\nThat doesn't excuse her behavior (what else were you supposed to do to support her? Slam your fingers in the door so you could both be in pain together?) but maybe just give her a little bit of the benefit of the doubt, in case there was something else going on that she didn't tell you about. \n\nNTA, officially.", "yes but if you aren\u2019t going to accept any help or try anything it\u2019s unfair for someone else to have to hear your complaining for hours", "Stfu already.", "I get the \"doesn't understand part\" because when I was in period pain hell, nothing did help. I'd be drugged up on 1500mg of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and some Naproxen. Nothing would take the edge off of the migraines except for time and ice packs all over my head as i prayed to a list of God's to send me through early menopause or end my life because I'd regularly hit the max limit of OTC drugs. Which, by the way, is terrible for your stomach.\n\nIt took a few trips to the ER before my GP decided maybe my period headaches weren't just headaches and maybe migraines. 10 years later I only just qualified for botox injections for my migraines. \n\nI also have friends with PCOS and Endometriosis, we all agree the OTC drugs may not work but we're the first ones to reach for that bottle of OTC pills because as much as \"nothing helps\" nothing is worse than lying there in misery feeling useless and in pain.\n\nOP, NTA.", "I can't take ibuprofen because it interacts with the meds that keep me sane. It is actually surprising how many OTC things you are not supposed to take with various psych meds. Not being able to take any cold meds or decongestants is the worst--I am limited to saline nasal spray when I have a bad cold.\n\nTylenol doesn't do much for my cramps so I usually just use a heating pad myself.", "Even less obligated to just tread water beside the person, because they are refusing any help to get to shore.", "Pity my smallest dog weighs 45 lbs (the other two are 55 lbs and 85 lbs); I think that might be a bit too much weight!", "I am sorry you (and your friends) have suffered so much with this. I definitely had a friend who tried to tell me once that if I stopped taking OTC meds for pain, my periods would stop being painful in the long run, and I flat out asked her why she thought I started taking them!\n\nAnd I don't get it in this case, re: don't understand part, because this girl hasn't even tried any solutions!", "I get occasional cramping, and pressure is the best for me.

I used to pop 3 of the 500mg ibuprofen, 3 500mg acetaminophen, and a Naproxen and that barely scratched the surface on my period pains. That's when my GP discovered that maybe my period \"headaches\" weren't \"headaches\" but migraines. So, yeah, I get botox injections now, am on a daily medication, and have an emergency medication so I don't OD on OTC meds. Sometimes the OTC stuff truly doesn't work but when im in pain I'm honestly stuffing handfuls of drugs into my face hoping for any sort of relief. You don't not take it and complain, you take everything you can that won't kill you while simultaneously hope that some deity takes mercy and removes an eye (where my period migraines happen) or both ovaries and starts menopause.", "No worries!

But you can only do so much and you really didnt technically have to offer any help at all.

Your friend needs to talk to her Dr if she is getting pain that bad so they can figure out if something actually is wrong with her.", "I'm gonna go with NTA. You offered different things for her to try to help with the pain, she refused. If she had said that that stuff doesn't help, because it doesn't work for some people, then it would be different. But you gave her legit helpful advise, heat and/or meds. I don't think your friend is T A for refusing the help. But if you are not going to attempt to help the situation, then you kinda can't complain about it.", "NTA \n\nAnother suggestion for bad cramps is a hot bath. In fact, when my ovarian cysts burst, a bath was the only somewhat relief I had over the hours and hours of pain.", "NTA\n\nAs someone who also gets killer period cramps, you've got to make the effort to find what helps. If she's not going to take any advice given to her, she's making her own misery. \n\nJust a tip though, raspberry leaf tea does wonders for period cramps.

I've already maxed out on drugs, can only have ice on your eyes for so long. So you lay there in pissed off misery as people try and help you but nothing will help except maybe a God of fertility turning back the clock and being fucking nice to you.\n\nI do empathize with the helplessness feeling but ffs there are natural pain killers out there. It's almost like she's some super religious crunchy descendent who truly believes it's the woman's punishment to suffer through a menstrual cycle.\n\nMaybe drugs really don't work for her? Maybe she isn't allowed them. Maybe heating pads spike her blood pressure and make it worse. We honestly don't know why she doesn't do the on hand quick fix remedies. I'm assuming she's a crunchy religious fruitcake and dear old dad told her she has to suffer for Eves sin but I've been wrong before."]}
