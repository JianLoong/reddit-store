I don't think you need to bring anything up to your siblings.  Ask your parents first.  \n\nI'd suggest that if your parents still want to leave their 50% to the other kids then you ask them for a buyout right in the will.  So whatever is market value you can give that to your siblings and you'd be allowed to take over the house.", "This is less a AITA question and more a legal one. Here, you will get answers to the morality of the situation, I suggest r/legaladvice for the legality of doing this. (Or one of the other legal advice subs that covers your country, if outside the US)", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with you inheriting their share of the house and your siblings inheriting money or property of equal value. That totally makes sense.", "Not sure if you are in the US or another country, but if you own the house 50/50, isn\u2019t there a deed or contact that states what happens in the event one of you dies?  If not get one asap. Your siblings have nothing to do with the house. Speak with an attorney about what you should do and then present a plan to your parents ASAP. depending on where you live, without a will or other property document, their estate might be split evenly among all siblings.", "NTA.  Depending on how the deed to that house is worded, you may already inherit when they die.   If the deed has everybody as joint tenants with right of survivorship, then it's basically \"last man standing\" on  who ultimately ends up with the house.  Check the deed.", "NTA\n\nYou are half owner - It makes sense for you to get the rest when your parents pass. It is not your siblings business - its the business of your parents and it is their decision alone.", "NTA, I think because of the partial ownership situation you are just looking for an uncomplicated situation which is a reasonable move to make. You get the rest of what you already partially own, they get everything else to your parents' name. I think it's especially fair because it appears you're even down to forfeit any sort of access to their financial assets for this. \n\nIf they wanted in, they should've bought in.", "Check the deed first.

If this is true, then what your siblings will inherit will be peanuts. If you want to ask for a buyout clause, that would make a lot of sense. But just wanting to inherit everything of value seems AHish to me!!", "Not sure if property laws are different for whatever country you're in, but you are already an owner of the house, and if your parents die, you will be the sole owner. With or without a will. They cannot will to someone else property that you own.\nYou say the loan is 50% yours, 50% theirs, but I think that might just be how you've divided it up yourselves. I think technically, all owners are 100% responsible for all payments because you all 100% own the property together. Unless the upstairs and downstairs are separately titled. \nNah, look into this before you rock the boat.", "This will depend on the relative value of all the available inheritance. Why not tell your parents that you're concerned about your house, and ask them to consider getting it valued, along with any other assets, so you can see how much you and your siblings would expect to get? And ask if they would put a clause in their will giving you the option to buy out your siblings when the time comes. Then you can start saving for that.", "NAH.\n\nJust some thoughts; \n\nIf you do this, you are very likely to drive a wedge between you and your inheritance can cause issues. No idea how you feel about that.\n\nIf several people own it, they're probably not going to want to live there.\n\nIf you go for an even split, you will, presumably, own enough to buy out your siblings with a loan against the value of the property. Or you can manage the apartment as a shared rental property or something. Point is you have options.", "This is kind of above AITA pay grade. \n\nWhy not buy out your parents? That way the property will legally be yours before they pass so there is no question or threat to your sole ownership?", "OP ESH because as long as your parents are of sound mind and can think for themselves it's not your decision how they write their will or divide up property (house or jewelry or anything else). You only have the right to tell them you would like to own the house outright and are not interested in anything else that belongs to them.", "YTA. Not a popular take, but the half house and all the stuff inside your parents half would all be equally owned by you and your siblings. If the value of the half of the house is less than your share of the sum of that, then fine. If the value though is greater, then you would be stealing from your siblings.

That said, it really depend on what exactly and how you are asking.\n\nFor example, if their 50% of the house is worth 200k$ and the rest of their assets combined is 150k$, then you are basically asking them to get 200k$ while your siblings would get 50k$ each (I assume 3 siblings for the sake of simplicity). For a lot of people, their house is their biggest assets, so the chance are getting what you ask would be unfair.\n\nA better solution might be to ask your parent if you can buy them out of their share, but let them stay there.

So for me, should the rest of the estate excluding the house be worth enough to give you all an equal share overall, taking into account any equity in the home from the parents' share, then fine. But you say you have \"several\" siblings, so would that be the case? If it weren't the case, I'd be happy to make it clear in my will that you must be given the option to buy out your siblings since you were a part owner.\n\nUnless you are sure they are well off enough to do this while leaving you all an equal share, I think you would be TA for asking for the house in all honesty, but not if you just asked for the option to be able to buy your siblings out, because you should have peace of mind around your living arrangements. I also don't see what relevance how your siblings spend their money has. So no judgement yet from me, because I don't feel I don't know enough yet.", "NAH but honestly if you already share the loan, the house should be yours if they end up dying so that honestly shouldn't be an issue.

You'll probably need legal advice locally.\n\nNAL and disregard the rest if you're legally sorted.. But why not just get a HELOC (or equivalent) to service their expenses? Ten years of care would have added up to a lot already. At 70 they may still need considerable funds to have a decent stand of living, especially if in US and/or remote. There may not even be any funds left by the end if they need to be put in a nursing home or health deteriorates. (Hopefully not.) Of course you'll need to document anything in case the will is contested in the future. Since there's no contact with your siblings they may be able to claim alienation as well. You'll need to take steps to protect your family here too.\n\nAlso depends on your title deed. If it's tenants in common then above situation applies (you said 50/50?). But if instead it's a joint ownership then their will doesn't matter, you'll have rights of survivorship. So better for you to liquidate their other assets first, if you're not emotionally attached. Best to ask them what they prefer.\n\nThen again if you're in Europe then some (all?) countries legally require them to leave a minimum amount to their kids.\n\nBest to get everything planned and documented while they're healthy. Might also want to consider POA/EPOA (medical and financial).\n\nGood luck!", "What\u2019s the value of all this other stuff in comparison with the house?

When my mom retired, she paid off the house. Since then, my sister has been slowly buying out Mom's share, thus supplementing her retirement money. Five years ago, mom transferred the house into solely my sister's name. Now, if my mom were to need to be moved into a memory care unit in a nursing home (she has dementia), when Medicaid(us) does their 5 year look back, they can't touch the house. I don't resent my sister getting a very nice house, because she is the one who had to live with mom and grandma all these years.
