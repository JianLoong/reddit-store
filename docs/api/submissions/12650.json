Good for you! Hopefully, your grades are good so you can move out to college in a couple of years. Good luck!", "NTA you just told her how you feel.", "Have been military myself, I understand how hard it is to make friends while moving around. Yea, she has friends from high school that she still keeps in contact with after building relationships with them over the course of her whole school life\u2026. But how many people does she keep in contact with from all the different bases your dad has been stationed at. \n\nI still talk to friends from high school, but I\u2019m not in contact with anyone from my military days anymore. As you said, it\u2019s hard to build those friendships. \n\nAlso, being a father myself, I see my son making more friends with a more diverse background through discord and online games. I am careful about his friends and talk to him about them to make sure he\u2019s safe (some people online are predators and will act like your friend for bad reasons) and as long as you\u2019re careful, I don\u2019t see a problem with that.\n\nEdit: for judgement NTA", "NAH. It's good to have talks with your mom about how you feel. Dad is just working a job to support his family. Mom is trying to help you make friends. Seems all good to me.", "Nta, I know of someone who was a military kid and he feels much the same as you. It's not healthy for kids to grow up without permanent roots.", "NTA\u2014your mom asked because she probably already can tell and wanted to talk to you about it. You were honest with her, but not cruel. I don\u2019t think your mom is offended. She probably just worries about you and shared her experience to encourage you. That\u2019s all.\n\nOnline friends are real too, just saying!", "NAH. It\u2019s understandable that her asking you would have tapped into some anger. The fact that you move so much is out of your control, and it makes sense that you would guard your heart from the inevitable good-bye. What your mom said is also true, though I see the context being different for you. I love that you stay connected with people on Discord. \n\nI have also moved a lot. Sometimes I make a fast friend who I remain friends with long-term. It is worth it sometimes to let certain people in irl. Also, life doesn\u2019t always have to be like this. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve known so far, but you can choose to be more geographically rooted in the future. \n\nBTW: what you recounted did not sound harsh at all. It\u2019s good to be honest about where you are emotionally. You seem to be really insightful, and emotional intelligence will help you a lot in life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m sure if your mom put it into context of her struggling to make mom friends from bouncing around due to your dad\u2019s job, she\u2019d probably relate better. She\u2019s probably made a point of staying close with her friends from high school because she hasn\u2019t gotten a chance to establish adult friends. Your dad\u2019s career was a choice your parents likely made together, and there probably is some guilt on your mom\u2019s part for not providing you the stability for friendship that she and your dad had. Once you graduate from high school, you\u2019ll be able to choose to stay in one place. If you go to college, you\u2019ll be thrown in with a bunch of people your age who are also arriving on campus not knowing anyone, which will make it easy to make potentially lifelong friends from the beginning. I didn\u2019t meet my best friend until we were both working at the same place on campus in college.", " T A for believing this is your dads fault or for expressing this to your mum\n\nY T A for blaming your dad and his career though.  There is absolutely no reason for you not to have made friends throughout this time.  All (most at least) the other kids are in the same situation, they're making friends.  How you keep up the friendships when you move is also entirely up to you.", "YTA... friendship isn't always measured by the time you've been friends. Also, as a military brat myself, I can still get in touch with people I went to grade school with. And my mom keeps in touch with people both from high school AND people she met through my dad's military career. She's almost 90.\n\nYou are intentionally deciding to not make friends then blaming your dad. I guess you're too young to realize there are no guarantees in life. Kind of sad what you're doing to yourself but... \\*shrug\\*.", "INFO was this a normal conversation or a yelling match type conversation?", "NAH.  Been there.  if each duty station is two-three years, that\u2019s enough time to develop friendships.  Some last, most don\u2019t.  But if you\u2019re going to school on base, those others students are in the same situation.  My closet friendships were in my last three years in a foreign country.  I just had dinner with a couple of schoolmates last week.  It\u2019s been 40 years since I first met them.  They\u2019re family now, forged by the challenges of being a military brat.  At month end, I\u2019ll be visiting that foreign country with my spouse and seeing former classmates who remained there for dinner.  You\u2019re short changing yourself by not creating relationships.  I had no clue that even casual friends I had back then would mean so much now.  There have been many, many others like you.  Don\u2019t squander your precious time without friends\u2026give them a chance to get to know you.  Best of luck!", "NAH. I've had family members deal with very similar situations and in at least one case a strikingly similar incident as what you describe. It's a tough thing you're going through, at a tough age to go through it. You have to be honest with your parents about the situation and what you're feeling. And I think your mom just wants things to be better for you. At the end of the day your mom will hopefully understand and maybe even is glad you told her how you feel, even if it hurts for her to hear it.", "nta. you just answered her question in your most honest way. you can have acquaintances in 1-3 years, not friends. why did she even ask something that she knows the answer to? then drops the convo when she didnt like what she heard", "It sounds like you were expressing your frustrations about not having long-lasting friendships due to the frequent moves caused by your dad's job in the military. Your mom was trying to encourage you to make friends despite the challenges, which is understandable as she wants you to have a social support network. However, it's also understandable that you feel frustrated about the situation and may not feel like making the effort to make friends knowing that you will eventually move away.\n\nIt's important to recognize that your mom may be trying to offer support and guidance, even if it doesn't always come across in the way you want. It's also important to recognize that you have the right to express your feelings and frustrations, but try to do so in a respectful way that doesn't hurt others.\n\nPerhaps in the future, you can approach the conversation in a different way, such as acknowledging your mom's perspective and expressing your own in a calm and respectful manner. This may help facilitate a more productive conversation and help you and your mom understand each other better. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether you feel like you were too harsh in the conversation and if you want to apologize or clarify your feelings further.", "NTA I briefly babysat for a frequent moving military family and it was really hard on the kids. The middle child would get in trouble a lot at school and had a \u201cI don\u2019t care attitude\u201d, I strongly believe his actions were because he knew he would be living there for 2 years tops.", "That\u2019s the life of a GI kid. Most of the ones I knew (GI adjacent) were just like that: friendly, but didn\u2019t want to invest because whoops! They\u2019d be gone soon. Your mom, bless her, has no idea. There will come a time when you can settle and make long-lasting relationships. NTA.", "Well, at least when you do finally make some friends, you'll have a cool story about how your dad's job made you into an interesting recluse.", "1) are you actively in touch with those people or are you just \u201cI could if I wanted to.\u201d? Because there\u2019s a difference. \n\n2) kid doesn\u2019t want to make close relationships just to up and leave because of dads career. That shit happens. It\u2019s what the kid needs to not break down every time they have to pick up and leave. \n\n3) it is, quite literally, dads fault. He\u2019s in the military and now because he couldn\u2019t get a normal fucking Job his family has to move every 1-3 years for him. \nIt is DADS fault. Mind you, we all know he could\u2019ve gotten out a long time ago. The man has re-enlisted and the wife went along and now their kid doesn\u2019t want friends because it would be too hard emotionally for them to handle it. \n\nYou\u2019re basically telling a child, \u201coh well, when I did it it wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d YOU are NOT op. You are not the same person. You do not get to tell someone to just tough it out because it ended up really well for you. Get your head out of your ass.", "Your story is not the universal one. There are some who were lucky to have made those friendships and some who did not get the chance to. This type of lifestyle can be very traumatic for some. Kind of sad you are ragging on a kid who has a different experience than you but... *shrug*.", "It wasn't yelling but I was raising my voice near the end", "1. I'm not in touch on a regular basis with any friends but that's my preference and my friends know it. I haven't seen/heard from/texted my best friend in about 5 months, my second best friends only once in the past 2.5 years. Some friends have died. Yes, I'm weird and I recognize that. But I don't blame it on my early childhood or my dad being in the military. \n2. Kid is *making* the choice to not have friends and then blames his dad. Really, he sounds like the type of kid who says 'why should I study, I'll never pass the test anyway' \\*sulk, sulk\\*. This may be where I am telling the kid (in your words) to tough it out... I'm not telling him that, I'm telling him that I have no respect for him because (1) he wants friends but isn't trying but is (2) blaming someone else for his failure to have friends. I'm not telling him to tough it out because it ended up really well for me, I'm telling him that he's the only one who can actually reach out in friendship... and he's chosen not to because he might be hurt. Reality check, darling, to quote Wesley from The Princess Bride, 'life is pain, highness'.\n3. Actually, there are no rules that a family MUST follow the military partner... wife and son could live in one town forever and only see husband/dad occasionally. And there are people who actually PREFER having a military career. I moved every two-three years and regretted retiring. Also, you're forgetting that many people who are not in the military also have to relocate due to their work... so no matter where they lived, there are no guarantees that he would never leave his hometown buddies and best friends.\n\nIn other words, I'm telling a child 'It's your choice to make friends and if you don't because of what you think might/will happen in the future, then that is what you have decided and chosen. But remember, we always say goodbye at some point in life.'", "Not ragging on a kid because he has different experiences/expectations than me.\n\nI am ragging on him for giving up before even trying,\n\nragging on him for defining friendships in only one way (by length of knowing someone due to living in the same town),\n\nragging on him for blaming someone else when IT'S HIS CHOICE to not even try.\n\nragging on him for not being willing to try to keep a long distance friendship alive,\n\nAnd ragging on him for not realizing that people will always be moving in and out of his life and he should treasure them for the short amount of time he knows them.\n\nETA: He has the chance, he's simply not going to bother unless it's a guarantee.", "In that case NTA. Your mom asked, you answered. She didn't like the answer she got, so she pushed on the conversation and dropped it when you were clearly frustrated and had a point.\n\nIf she's aware at all, she probably knew or at least suspected that was why you were not branching out socially. She probably feels kind of guilty and wanted to encourage you to form those \"long-lasting relationships\" that she feels like you're being deprived of."]}
