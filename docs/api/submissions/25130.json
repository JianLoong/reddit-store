I ended up finding her almost 2 miles from the store she said she was going to and was completely out of it. She was parked almost 4 miles away from where I found her too so she was walking for awhile. I took her to the doctors and said she has early stages of dementia. It was good we caught it soon cause that is most likely the worst shell get without our supervision.  \n\n\nShe lives with my stepdad who's about a year younger than her and has had no signs of dementia and is still pretty mentally sound. The bummer is that he isnt physically there anymore as he needs a cane to walk around. I knew he wouldn't be able to take care of her once it starts getting worse but at least for a couple days she would be fine. I spent alot of time on my days off thinking about what to do with her since I couldn't move closer for my work and my stepdad wasn't in the best health to really be of much help.  \n\n\nI decided that id get her an in-home caregiver for the mornings-evenings on days I work and id take care of her on days I had off. She is usually more calm at nights to the point my stepdad would be able to help her into bed and get changed. I didnt really run this by anyone, but I was gonna ask my stepdad if he was ok with this cause like he was the one who'd have to live through it.  \n\n\nWhen I went to visit my stepsister was over cause my stepdad told her the news and she was checking up on my mom too. I sat my stepdad down and told him the plan about getting a day time care giver for my work days and id be over on my days off. My stepsister kept interrupting me saying that the plan \"wouldn't work\", how id \"be losing money for no reason\" and how id get \"burned out\" and how I \"didn't bring this to her first\" I was pretty annoyed when she kept interjecting but I think I played it cool.  \n\n\nWe both had to leave at the same time and (this is where I might be TA) I told her that her suggestions aren't helpful and that she really doesn't get a say in how I want to go about treating MY mom. Also told her to basically butt out cause its my responsibility not hers. I could see she got pretty upset at what I said and left without saying a word.  \n\n\nI have had some time to think about this and even told one of my cousins what I said and he says im being pretty mean when she just wanted to help and kinda curious what outsiders think.

I honestly agree that your stepsister doesn\u2019t necessarily get a say in how your mother is cared for but legally your stepdad is the one responsible for making the decisions. I point this out, because if his daughter steps in and starts influencing him that might change things. You might want to talk with your mother and find out who she wants making her healthcare decisions before her dementia progresses.  I will say that your stepsister is probably right and that you will eventually get burnt out trying to spend all of your time off taking care of your mother. But an in-home caregiver is a great idea. Considering your stepfather\u2019s health, you and your stepsister might consider an assisted living facility for both of your parents, as they often provide a large array of services including transportation and meals, while providing the security of having others close by in case of an emergency.

I realize dementia is a challenging diagnosis for everyone to face. The decisions you are making for your mom have a direct and meaningful impact on your stepfather and, indirectly, will even impact your step sister to some degree.

Your plan is admirable and may come from a place of love and is short term at best and absolutely impacts your stepdad and step siblings. \n-Agree with other recommendations here to have a whole family discussion. Accept help when you can get it \n-Get legal paperwork in place ASAP (e.g., durable POA, healthcare directive, Social Security, will, end of life wishes). \n-Get in touch with local city, state, county etc. Division of Eldercare to understand what resources are available, from day eldercare programs that may include transport, to financial aid resources etc. \n- You\u2019ll need to consider modifying the house a bit- door alarms, cameras etc. \n-Memory care giving is expensive. You\u2019ll need a short and long term plan. (E.g., will she need to go to a memory care assisted living facility and at what point?) Unless you are wealthy, supporting two or more household is financially draining and this disease can take a while. My Mom passed 6 years after her diagnosis but I had sketched out a plan for 10 years. \n-if you haven\u2019t already - No more driving for your Mom. Not only for her safety, but for others as well \n-You and your stepdad will need support - consider joining a family support group \n-Make new memories and take as many videos and pictures as you can \n\nStay Strong OP.

Not sure why you think it is, even if you\u2019d like it to be. \n\nThat being said, I get wanting to jump in and make sure everything is taken care of.

I know OP says his mom is calmer during the night but this is very much not the norm for dementia patients, and it is quite likely that she may soon end up going through sundowning each night. For those that don't know, sundowning is when dementia patients get very agitated, anxious, and even aggressive at night. That isn't really something someone who walks with a cane and is physically frail is equipped to handle.\n\nI can totally see why stepsis is having doubts about the system OP is suggesting. I think that her pointing that OP may get burned out from using all his days off plus every single non-working hour in the week to care for his mom is very realistic.
