{"id": 27565, "submission_id": "16r5x08", "title": "AITA for telling me brother the truth when asked despite knowing it wasn't what he actually wanted to hear?", "selftext": "My brother asked me and our other siblings for our honesty last week. This was not out of the blue entirely but none of us were sure if he would actually ask or if he would just vent about his circumstances. We had already discussed things in depth with each other before and knew we were on the same page. But our brother was never around for this. When the question came to us I was the only one who was willing to answer.\n\nBackground: My brother was married and had three children with his wife. Sadly she died when their youngest was only 4 months old. The older two kids were toddlers. He was single for a good decade and focused on his kids and then he met his current wife Kat. Kat was a widow, though a more recent widow, and she had two kids with her late husband. All the kids were 11 or older when they met and my brother and Kat became a more serious couple. The kids were fine with the adults dating but expressed they did not want to be a blended family. So my brother and Kat made the decision to marry, live together, but they would not be a family. My brother would take care of his kids, Kat would take care of hers, and they could interact or not. No pressure.\n\nIt was an unusual dynamic and they never did mix or integrate more. The kids stuck to their bio siblings and parent and did not build relationship with their stepparent or stepsiblings. But it worked in a way most would find crazy. The kids were happy. My brother and Kat were happy.\n\nWhen the kids got married, their bio parent had their spouse as a plus one and they were treated as a plus one and not family. None of the stepsiblings were invited and spouses were not in the family photos.\n\nSadly Kat lost both her kids in early 2020. I believe this has led to where we're at now.\n\nMy nephew and his wife are expecting their first child together and my brother and Kat wanted her to be grandma to the child because Kat's kids will never be able to give her grandchildren. My nephew said he didn't want that and he didn't want the dynamic to change.\n\nMy brother vented to my siblings and I about this a few times. Then he asked if we thought it would change and whether it was surprising that this happened. I told him I did not see it changing and the dynamic made it unsurprising. I said Kat is a casual acquaintance to the kids at best, just like he was to Kat's kids, and I never thought they would be grandma or grandpa to the other's grandkids. I said I did not feel like Kat's kids would have allowed him to be grandpa if the roles were reversed. I said that was the dynamic they set early on and it has been that way for almost 20 years and it's unlikely to ever change. I knew my brother might not like it and I was right. He told me nobody expects to lose all their kids and to have grandparenthood taken from you. He also said I made it sound like his and Kat's fault. Our other siblings defended me but my brother said I went too far and let me know that a couple of times during the week as well.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695582587, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16r5x08/aita_for_telling_me_brother_the_truth_when_asked/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s never been a parent to those kids and she doesn\u2019t get to pretend now just because she\u2019s grieving a life she thought she\u2019d have.", "NTA. Kat can't retroactively build that relationship with his kids that would be needed for them to let them have that relationship with their kids, which is entirely fair.", "NTA \n\nYou don't get a family relationship now if you never fostered a family relationship before \n\n>He told me nobody expects to lose all their kids and to have grandparenthood taken from you\n\nIt grosses me out when people believe their kids are required to breed them grandkids", "NTA. You only told your brother what he knew. I am around blended families where the kids felt they had two moms and/or two dads, and those parents are now considered grandparents, but your brother and and his wife set it up NOT to be that way and they can't force feelings on kids now.", "NTA. It was your honest oppinum and it sounds like the agrement was like that. \n\nBut I see some of the points. Kat was never the mother of your nephew, but she is still the wife of the childs grandfather, so it could become a natural grandmother like thingy. I myself called our downstair neighbur grandma because she was old and gave us sweets. She might should ask for the role of step-grandmother. Because she will interact with the child, wouldn'T she? Every time the child will visit his grandfather", "NTA\n\nHe asked for an honest opinion, not lip service.  \n\nGrandparenthood?  Seriously, like this is a right?\n\nDear brother and his wife need a little bit of a dose of reality.  She is their father's spouse.  That is ALL she ever will be.", "NTA. Your brother asked and you delivered. Unless your were intentionally cruel in your delivery.  Considering on how often I see posts of step parents and siblings trying to force blended families and getting ripped for it I it wasn't a \"cold\" or \"bad\" thing. All of the children got to state their preferences and have their family the way they wanted it. \n\nKat could still be a grandparent but be called something else just because she is grandpa's wife. IF she doesn't try to force a relationship that your nephew doesn't want.", "op=nta\n\nyou were asked, you answered.\n\nAnd no one is guaranteed grandparenthood(even IF they have parents).  Kat's kids died before they had kids--but they also could have chosen to be child-free or been infertile.\n\nIt is reasonable that a person that your nephew sees as his dad's wife and not a stepmother is not going to welcome her as a grandmother.\n\nIf your brother continues to push this, he will likely ruin his relationship with his son.  Bad choice on his part.  \n\nKat can ask to be grandauntie/(grandma) to her sibling's grandkids and see how they feel about it.", "NTA. He and his wife created this situation by letting children make the rules all those years ago. They may not like the reality, but this is what they have to live with. They raised some cold-hearted offspring.", "NTA but absolutely this is a situation your brother and Kat created. It's no one's fault as such...\n\nBut you definitely can't retroactively change relationships. If your brother pushes this, he may damage his relationship with his son.\n\nIt's super weird that it turned out this way. And it's very sad for Kat. The whole thing is incredibly sad for Kat.\n\nBut having children never guarantees being a grandparent, even if those children live a long full life. Not everyone gets that particular relationship.\n\nI would add the best thing to suggest is for the brother to let his son know that Kat is open to that relationship, no pressure, and to get in touch if they need anything either way. The new father may feel VERY different when he is struggling for childcare and Kat is an option...\n\nYou don't actually have to have a parental relationship to be a good grandparent -- plenty of step grandparents come in late and have great relationships with their partner's grandkids. And it's gonna be a bit awkward going over to 'grandpa and grandpa's wife's place.' If Kat doesn't push it too much, it may naturally end up being a pretty comfortable middle ground.", "> told me nobody expects to lose all their kids and to have grandparenthood taken from you. He also said I made it sound like his and Kat's fault.   \n\nBad shit happens to good people all the time. Nobody plans for it, it just happens. But yeah, it's absolutely their fault for fostering encapsulated behavior with their kids.   \nThey made this bed. They may as well stretch out and get comfortable.   \n\nNTA", "NTA: Kat made it very clear to the kids that she didn't want to be their mother.  Now, she is reaping the consequences that she sewed.  Her lack of forethought is not the kids' problem and of course she will never be their children's grandmother. That is the dynamic that she wanted...too late to change it now.", "NTA. I feel terrible for Kate, but grandparenthood can't be taken from you. It's not something you're entitled to.", "Nta he needed to hear it. Kat wants to be grandma to the consolation prize kids. They know she wouldn\u2019t have cared for them if her kids were still alive. I would find kats change of heart very insulting. She doesn\u2019t care about them she just wants a title, it\u2019s incredibly selfish of her and your brother to put this on his children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's really unfortunate that her kids died, but it's not up to your adult nibblings to suddenly step up as his wife's children. NTA.", "NTA, but I\u2019m confused on what your nephew thinks is going to happen. She\u2019s your brother\u2019s wife, they\u2019ve been together a long time and when the grandkids visit is she not supposed to interact with them? Or buy them gifts or be nice to them? You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, you were just honest. And while it is a situation of their own making, it\u2019s better than the alternative of them being the pushy stepparents who don\u2019t gaf about their kids wishes.\n\nI honestly would\u2019ve said n a h if they didn\u2019t have that reaction, but then again it\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA. It\u2019s the consequences of their own actions", "NTA\n\nIt's possible for the child to see Kat as  grandparent even though there is no relationship between new dad and Kat. My mom got married when I was in my early 20s. I never saw him as a father figure but my kids grew up seeing him as Papa. And you can always come up with a name that doesn't have grandma in it.", "NTA\n\nThe truth hurts, bro.", "Exactly. She can't just take over the kids lives now just because her kids died. She needs therapy and to grieve, but that doesn't mean she can replace her dead kids with her step kids. \n\nThey aren't 'taking away' anything. She had a tragedy, but that's just life. You can't make take from the rest of the world just because you lost something important.", "Depends on whether or not the nephew wants her around as a 'natural grandmother like thingy' for his child.", "Yeah  that makes it a little tricky. She was never a mom to her steps, but the grandkids will probably slot her into a grandmotherly role even if the nephew never refers to her as such. We had a similar situation where my MIL\u2019s husband is in no way my spouse\u2019s father, and we never referred to him with an honorific, but he was still basically a grandparent to our kids and we never tried to stop him from being one (well, until recently but that\u2019s a whole other story that has nothing to do with him). I\u2026actually don\u2019t know how my son thinks of him.", "The enviorment was perfect! You don't HAVE to have blended families. If they tried forcing that relationship ops brother might not even be allowed to see his grandkids. \n\nSo many stories on this subreddit would have benefitted from relationships like this. \n\nThis situation would have never had an issue if Kats children's were still in the picture, but now Kat is in grief and her husband is trying to find any form of solace for her.\n\nThe kids don't owe her that, she is nothing more than a neighbor at best to them. And that's fine!

Don\u2019t blame the kids. It was way easier for the parents to worry about their own kids then blend the family.

Sounds pretty chilly to me.  :-)", "Yeah, but that's the dynamic all five kids wanted and preferred. They lived under the same roof but there really was no interaction between the two sides. Not the most traditional way to live but everyone was happy with it.", "Yeah, and now Kat is trying to build a relationship out of thin air. Having put no effort into a relationship before now, she\u2019s delusional to believe she can claim one now with no foundation.
