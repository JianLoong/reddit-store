This was not out of the blue entirely but none of us were sure if he would actually ask or if he would just vent about his circumstances. We had already discussed things in depth with each other before and knew we were on the same page. But our brother was never around for this. When the question came to us I was the only one who was willing to answer.\n\nBackground: My brother was married and had three children with his wife. Sadly she died when their youngest was only 4 months old. The older two kids were toddlers. He was single for a good decade and focused on his kids and then he met his current wife Kat. Kat was a widow, though a more recent widow, and she had two kids with her late husband. All the kids were 11 or older when they met and my brother and Kat became a more serious couple. The kids were fine with the adults dating but expressed they did not want to be a blended family. So my brother and Kat made the decision to marry, live together, but they would not be a family. My brother would take care of his kids, Kat would take care of hers, and they could interact or not. No pressure.\n\nIt was an unusual dynamic and they never did mix or integrate more. The kids stuck to their bio siblings and parent and did not build relationship with their stepparent or stepsiblings. But it worked in a way most would find crazy. The kids were happy. My brother and Kat were happy.\n\nWhen the kids got married, their bio parent had their spouse as a plus one and they were treated as a plus one and not family. None of the stepsiblings were invited and spouses were not in the family photos.\n\nSadly Kat lost both her kids in early 2020. I believe this has led to where we're at now.\n\nMy nephew and his wife are expecting their first child together and my brother and Kat wanted her to be grandma to the child because Kat's kids will never be able to give her grandchildren. My nephew said he didn't want that and he didn't want the dynamic to change.\n\nMy brother vented to my siblings and I about this a few times. Then he asked if we thought it would change and whether it was surprising that this happened. I told him I did not see it changing and the dynamic made it unsurprising. I said Kat is a casual acquaintance to the kids at best, just like he was to Kat's kids, and I never thought they would be grandma or grandpa to the other's grandkids. I said I did not feel like Kat's kids would have allowed him to be grandpa if the roles were reversed. I said that was the dynamic they set early on and it has been that way for almost 20 years and it's unlikely to ever change. I knew my brother might not like it and I was right. He told me nobody expects to lose all their kids and to have grandparenthood taken from you. He also said I made it sound like his and Kat's fault. Our other siblings defended me but my brother said I went too far and let me know that a couple of times during the week as well.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695582587, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16r5x08/aita_for_telling_me_brother_the_truth_when_asked/", "score": 455, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was your honest oppinum and it sounds like the agrement was like that. \n\nBut I see some of the points. Kat was never the mother of your nephew, but she is still the wife of the childs grandfather, so it could become a natural grandmother like thingy. I myself called our downstair neighbur grandma because she was old and gave us sweets. She might should ask for the role of step-grandmother. Because she will interact with the child, wouldn'T she?

Your brother asked and you delivered. Unless your were intentionally cruel in your delivery.  Considering on how often I see posts of step parents and siblings trying to force blended families and getting ripped for it I it wasn't a \"cold\" or \"bad\" thing.

Kat's kids died before they had kids--but they also could have chosen to be child-free or been infertile.\n\nIt is reasonable that a person that your nephew sees as his dad's wife and not a stepmother is not going to welcome her as a grandmother.\n\nIf your brother continues to push this, he will likely ruin his relationship with his son.  Bad choice on his part.  \n\nKat can ask to be grandauntie/(grandma) to her sibling's grandkids and see how they feel about it.", "NTA. He and his wife created this situation by letting children make the rules all those years ago. They may not like the reality, but this is what they have to live with. They raised some cold-hearted offspring.", "NTA but absolutely this is a situation your brother and Kat created. It's no one's fault as such...\n\nBut you definitely can't retroactively change relationships. If your brother pushes this, he may damage his relationship with his son.\n\nIt's super weird that it turned out this way. And it's very sad for Kat. The whole thing is incredibly sad for Kat.\n\nBut having children never guarantees being a grandparent, even if those children live a long full life. Not everyone gets that particular relationship.\n\nI would add the best thing to suggest is for the brother to let his son know that Kat is open to that relationship, no pressure, and to get in touch if they need anything either way. The new father may feel VERY different when he is struggling for childcare and Kat is an option...\n\nYou don't actually have to have a parental relationship to be a good grandparent -- plenty of step grandparents come in late and have great relationships with their partner's grandkids. And it's gonna be a bit awkward going over to 'grandpa and grandpa's wife's place.' If Kat doesn't push it too much, it may naturally end up being a pretty comfortable middle ground.", "> told me nobody expects to lose all their kids and to have grandparenthood taken from you.

But damn, how do you live with a kid for years and just stay an causal acquaintance? That takes a lot more effort than to get a friendly relationship with them.", "It's also gross that they think his kids are now obligated to fill that role for her. She just wants to use them to fill a void and if her kids were still around she wouldn't give a shit about being grandma to those kids.", "Thank you! Would she have done this if her kids had both decided to be child free? Like GTFO now that you can\u2019t have something you want you wanna force a relationship with people that don\u2019t need or want one? Nahhhhhhhh", "I think my nephew and nieces would just say grandpa's house. And mostly they see each  other outside of the house away from Kat so it wouldn't be an issue about her being around. Unless my brother and Kat want that to change. But the kids might not want to see Kat more than they do.", "Even if they had a closer relationship they may still not want Kat to be grandma, a lot of step children don't, especially if their other parent is still alive.\n\nETA NTA, this situation is what it is.", "Cold hearted why? Not everyone wants to be family with everyone.", "The kids are no more cold-hearted than the adults have been.  The family dynamic they created was made by the adults, and both kids and adults have lived by it for years.  That includes Kat. Now that Kat doesn't have kids, she now expects OP's kids to suddenly start viewing her as a mother... or at least, for OP's kids to see her as grandmother, despite there being no relationship before.  Kat is being unreasonable and selfish.  The kids... have no relationship with her.  How can she reasonably expect them to change now?  They most certainly know that if she hadn't lost her kids that Kat would have quite happily continued her relationship with them as before, with no change. NTA", "Sad but true. Even if her own children had survived it wasn't a certainty either - plenty of people forego having children because they aren't able to and or interested.", "That could be\u2026 but she\u2019s making things about herself rather than the kids. A good step-grandmother-like-entity should be focused on caring for the kids and let the relationship grow, not focusing on what she can get for herself, the role she wants. I expect that if your neighbour had initially showed up at your door, introduced herself to your parents and told them how important it was for her to give you sweets because she didn\u2019t have grandkids, your parents would have been far less inclined to that relationship.\n\nKat could interact with the kids as \u201cgrandpa\u2019s partner\u201d and see what grows. But she\u2019s lobbying for \u201cgrandma\u201d right away.", "My brother normally sees and spends time with the kids without Kat. That was what Kat did with her children too. I think it was extremely rare that they saw their parents spouse (my nephew and nieces and Kat's kids). I assume that's what my nephew will want to keep things the way they have always been and for Kat to not be around.", "This is a great point.  My father remarried and my mom passed away before my daughter was born.  Dad's second wife was never my stepmother since I was an adult when they married, and I certainly never treated her as a parental figure, but she stepped into the grandma role for my daughter since my own mother was not in the picture.", "Not even so much them - just their kid aka the grand baby", "They did not. They shared meals with their bio family but not as a whole group. My brother and Kat took care of their own kids without help from their spouse.", "They were both in an accident while vacationing together.", "They never did any of those things. There really wasn't any family built when they married. Just two households sharing a space and a married couple who each had their own kids.", "Not sure where you get that its not a sustainable dymanic\n\nIts incredibly normal here in sweden, i lived that way, many of my friends lived that way, none of us minded or felt it was bad\n\nMy stepdad is my mothers husband, i like him but hes not in a father role, same for my stepmom", "I think nephew will call her grandpa's wife with his child not grandma like how he treated her as father's wife not step-mother.", "Probably the same as what happened before. Kat does her own thing and visits with their dad are separate from her. It's how things worked with Kat's kids as well. They didn't really see the parents spouse.", "At least before this, Kat would not have been going with my brother to see the kids. Same way my brother wasn't around when she was seeing hers. That might be something my nephew and nieces want to keep up.", "They might not explain Kat very much to their kids. I can see it being a thing of wanting to keep the status quo where they see their dad only and not Kat, because that's how it was always done.", "I think it will depend. When my brother spends time with his kids normally, they do so away from Kat and she did the same with her kids. My nephew might want to keep doing that when the kids come along. It will really depend on how things progress and whether my brother's kids want there to be change in how they handle time spent with him.", "It sounds like everyone would have been better off if the parents didn\u2019t move in together. Take your time, let relationships develop organically without forcing the kids to cohabitate.", "Yeah, Kat can't treat her husband's kids as backup kids to sub in since hers are gone. Not to downplay her grief; no parent should have to bury their child. But her grief is hers to manage, and it won't go away by trying to force her husband's kids to fill the void her own left.They simply cannot do that even if they wanted to. because there is no replacing a loss like that.\n\nBut even if Kat's kids *were* still in the picture, there's no guarantee she'd experience grandparenthood. Even if her kids lived, they might not have chosen to have children of their own, and she would have to figure out how to accept that. Even her own kids wouldn't have owed her grandkids, because other people's reproductive decisions aren't up to her, even if they are related to her or her husband.", "Well. It's unusual that love and care doesn't develop over 20 years. I do think that the parents created that, and that it may have been the path of least resistance then, but now the family is brittle. A child can't have enough grandparents, provided they're loving and suitable. The fact that they're so set against it means that there's something wrong - not just neutral - in the way these people relate to others. \n\nNTA except if you were brutal about it - he asked for your actual assessment and you're probably right.", "That's how things got for my father's spouse.. My kids had a good and loving relationship with her because they met her more often than their bio grandma. They called her by name but she was their grandma.", "NTA.\n\nBut how they handled their family is insane. You don't have to be a family to have dinner together. I have lunch with my colleagues together and we're not a family. They took it way too far with the separation of family.", "It just seems very weird, almost like they're disrespecting her and the decision their dad made when he married her.", "That\u2019s true. I hope it all works out for y\u2019all regardless of what they decide to do, without anyone getting too hurt over it.", "Love won't really develop if people never spend time together or interact with each other. That's how life was with them. They never really interacted with Kat and Kat's kids didn't really interact with my brother.", "Do you love your roommates?", "NTA You brother and Kat decided early on that they were seperate families. It's too late to change this now.  \n\n\nBut I really struggle to imagine living together in one house with two seperate families/households. No meals together? Separate TV rooms? Separate holidays? How did they organize everything separately?", "Since when do kids define the family dynamic.", "They didn't have meals together. Kat worked later than my brother did. Kat's kids would eat together or wait for her to come home for the three of them to eat. My brother and his kids would eat together mostly. Then weekends they would be doing their own things.\n\nThey never went on vacations together. Some might watch TV in the living room while others would be doing other stuff and vice versa.", "Relationships out of thin air happen all the time. My FIL has a new girlfriend. She is a grandma to her own grandchildren, but she build an instant relationship with my kid \"out of thin air.\" \n\nI think OP's niblings are struggling with the thick air of decades of weirdness.", "That actually sounds very nice. Your mother/father is happy with their partner and you are not forced to interact or open up the safety bubble of your own family.", "> the thick air of decades of weirdness\n\nI'm packing this away for future use. Very nice phrasing."]}
