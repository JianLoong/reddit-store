What he's more angry about now is that it's now in the system, so it's not as though he can just not pay and call it quits. I'd suggest going back to the courts. Because if he's purposely witholding CS at this point, he's liable for charges if I'm not mistaken.

Part of that duty is paying child support.\n\nI suggest going for the back support. Your ex is a liar who'd rather spend money on a lawyer to delay paying child support instead of paying child support. He'd rather toss $$$ at someone else instead of using it to put food in his daughter's mouth. More importantly, your daughter is going to face some big expenses in her life. Whether it's an accident that requires $$ to take care of, a car when she learns to drive, or college, that back support could fund it if you get it and save it. \n\nYou could get the money, put half in an immediately accessible emergency fund, and invest the other half.

Maybe propose that bio dad pay a lump payment and then sign rights over to new husband.", "That would be a solid plan.", "Yes of course YTA. He never wanted a kid with you. If it can't afford it on your own why didn't you get an abortion?", "Nta not even a tiny bit. Kid comes first", "NTA. \n\nHe chose to continually fuck around, now he\u2019s finding out.

Why should you care about HIS situation??? He abandoned you to raise his daughter with no financial or emotional support from him at all.  \nObviously he didn't care in the least about your situation.  \nNTA!", "NTA.\n\n\"It cracks me.up.that you think I give a fuck what you think.

I'm asking do you legitimately believe what you're doing (trying to get the child support) might be asshole-ish?", "The dude who doesn't care about nor know about YOUR situation due to HIM is mad that you don't know about his situation... \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 some people...  and dude makes plenty of money. He just doesn't want to downsize", "op-nta\n\nYou don't know or care about his situation?  Well yes, that would be because he has ghosted you(and lied to you) multiple times.\n\nWork on that guilt tripping thing--get therapy, some some personal work whatever.  \n\nThis guy is an AH. he's ghosted you, he's ignored his daughter, he's lied repeatedly and he's just a deadbeat dad.  GO for GARNISHMENT so that you get caught up.  PUT money in savings for your daughter(But never ever call it child support money--it is YOUR MONEY that is going into her education/college fund.  It is your money going into emergency savings).  HIS MONEY is paying for her current care, her food, her housing, her clothes, her medical expenses.)\n\nNEVER let him guilt you for insisting he be responsible for the LIFE he created.

Hit him for every fucking penny you can and make sure it hurts him. \n\nMy dad paid a lawyer for advice on how to avoid paying child support and worked under the table or in some other shady capacity his entire life. He died owing my mother more than 10 years of unpaid support. The only way she got anything was from the one or two times they tracked him down and a tax return he didn't realize they would garnish. \n\nThe fact this asshole is making an insane amount of money and has been so deceitful to you the entire time. He has no integrity and is literally the archetype of the deadbeat father. Go at him hard and don't feel bad about it for a fucking second. You are ENTITLED to that money. Not going after it is a HUGE gift to him and he has shown you many many times that he does not deserve your generosity.\n\nGo for the fucking throat. For your daughter.", "Um.
