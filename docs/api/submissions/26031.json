I even contacted his relatives and was also ignored. \n\nI finally gave up after about 3 years because I was a single parent and just needed to move on. \n\nFast forward to her being 5 years old and starting to ask questions on why everyone else has a dad but not her. It was hard for me to answer because I didn\u2019t want to stain her mind just incase he starts coming around.I feel father daughter relationships are important and my opinion of him was not hers. I told her he\u2019s working far away and I had lost contact with him. \n\nI met my now husband who has 2 boys shortly after she turned 5. We are happy and things are great. The 5 year struggles my daughter and I had are finally behind us. \nA year later I was working at a dealership and guess who walks in? Yup her deadbeat dad. But not just him. He was with a woman and a little girl and a baby in tow. I didn\u2019t want to make a scene at my work so I made sure he didn\u2019t see me but when he left I went to the sales associate they we\u2019re talking to. I explained the situation and he was more then happy to pass along the number he gave them. \n\nI wanted to talk to my husband to see if I should just let it go or try to pursue some child support. We both agreed that is it the right of the child to have that support and would give her a better quality of life. \n\nSo I sent him a message saying who I was. And that it\u2019s time he starts to contribute to our daughter and we could work something out together without going to court (lawyers are expensive) he agreed but wanted a paternity test. I understand that and agreed told him to set it up. He mentioned he doesn\u2019t make a lot of money and wouldn\u2019t be able to afford much. But a little is better then nothing. \n\nThen I was ghosted again. \nA couple years and some court hearings and finally he was paying child support. I didn\u2019t go after back support cause I realize he has another family. Mr I don\u2019t make much has actually been earning $200 000 a year the whole time. \n\nJudge ordered him to pay cs based on his yearly earnings and back support for the 2 years he wasted the courts time when he should have been paying. He wasn\u2019t happy about that. But imo it\u2019s his own mess. \nNow he\u2019s never paid on time or in full and has an excuse every time. I\u2019ve had enough and gave him a piece of my mind and I didn\u2019t hold back. \n\nHe says I\u2019m an asshole because I don\u2019t know or care about his situation.

And now you've gone thru the court he should absolutely pay.\n\nBut purely from my perspective I wouldn't have gone that far. He's obviously not interested in his child and I think the drama and future issues might cause more harm than good.

Weird, you managed to tell a story about a dead beat father and I still manage to think Y T A  as well. Impressive!", "Nta, this is literally no one fault but his own.  Of he didn't want to pay back payments, he should have been paying all along.", "Refile an amendment asking for back pay based on his omission of assets and income. He knew he had a child, chose to not support or be involved and he then chose to start another family- your child deserves the child support.

Go hard after him.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhenever he is late, let the court handle it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you still can, go for back child support. YOu owe that to your kid.", "NTA.   \nI appreciate that you are trying to keep in mind his own children's lives when you are looking at your daughter - but he has not, and will not do that for his biological daughter or you. \n\nHe knew you were pregnant and did not care, nor did his family. He then *lied* to you about his earnings when he said he did not make much. Is it likely he is living outside his means, yes...is that your problem, no. \n\nStop speaking directly to him, go through the courts, lawyer or whatever processes your state/country has to receive the full support.

Neither do I!\n\nYou know what makes an asshole? Fathering a child and walking away.\n\nTake him for every red cent that the court will give. Garnish his wages & tax refunds.

I'm of the opinion that I see both sides; yes he had an obligation to the kid financially at minimum BUT I also feel men should get the choice to walk away. \n\nIf a woman wants to keep the kid; the man doesn't get a choice; if they don't want to keep the kid and the man does then his what? He do doesn't get the choice. It's not fair. \n\nMy oldest was planned, both me and my ex agreed to be parents so child support and custody was a given when we divorced. And I make sure he pays it with a court ordered IWO because he agreed to be a parent. \n\nMy youngest wasn't planned. And when I found out and decided to keep my kid I told my boyfriend at the time \"I know this isn't what you want but I do; so you have the choice to walk away. Free and clear. He thought about it and decided he wanted to see how things went. It worked out for everyone and we've been happily married for 4yrs.\n\nI think if women get to be the decision maker then women get to deal with the consequences of that decision regardless.

You\u2019re literally letting a deadbeat dad use money on his other kids that belongs to your daughter.  It\u2019s not about being nice, it\u2019s about being financially smart and securing you daughter\u2019s future.  He walked into that dealership to buy a car for his new family.  At that point he still hadn\u2019t done a damn thing for your daughter.  Being nice is good, but being smart is better.", "You should definitely go after the arrears especially with you mentioning your brain cancer - your daughter needs some financial security if anything is to happen to you (although she has her stepdad, but every extra helps). Im sorry about your diagnosis btw and hope the rest of your treatment goes well.", "Basically, OP needs to have this dealt with in court 4-5 years ago, for the sake of her daughter. Paternity test, child support, end of story. \n\nInstead we get the above story where OP does things that didn't get her daughter the necessary support, potentially could have gotten her fired from her job, and generally was ineffective while still annoying what I can only call the potential father.", "If you take into account what you\u2019ll be getting if the order was enforced as well as what you could receive for even if they awarded percent backpay, it would be well worth it in the long run. He was deceitful and he lied on purpose. Judges don\u2019t like lying about and hiding income . Maybe call around ask what it would cost for initial consult (usually free) and to file amended papers and go to court- you may even be able to ask the fees to be paid by absent ex.", "Youll get more than that back in CP & the arrears if go after it. The lawyer costs is an investment.", "I will be. Amongst all of this I was diagnosed with brain cancer. Once I\u2019m done with the last of my treatments I will be seeing him in court", "Also, it's her daughter the one she should be nice first", "Dude did you not read the whole part where OP tried tracking him down for years?? He ghosted her and disappeared. Then when he ghosted the second time she got the courts involved. What else should she have done? It\u2019s like we read completely different things.", "Don't wait for the last of your treatments.  I get that you need to be focused on your health right now, but do this NOW for the sake of your daughter.    \n\n\nGod forbid something should go wrong, get her set up with the payments for her support coming in regularly.  Have a judge know your condition, it may have an effect on how the judge treats your child's father for jerking you around.  \n\n\nAnd above all, best of wishes on your cancer journey.  You beat that disease!  From one survivor to another.  You've got this!"]}
