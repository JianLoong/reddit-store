{"id": 11968, "submission_id": "11nu26c", "title": "AITA for telling my aunt off for yelling at my nephews?", "selftext": "I (31f) am currently visiting my family in the UK with my husband (37m) who needs to be in London and Glasgow for a few weeks for work, we normally live abroad. Last week our nephews came to visit us during their holidays - Alex (6m) and Sam (7m), not their real names. Alex and Sam don't really speak English yet.\n\nI took the boys for a day out with my parents and my aunt on my dad's side, on one of the days my husband was working. They're from a big city and don't spend a lot of time in the countryside, so we took them out into the country. We had a great time, and during the day, the kids saw an animal they'd never seen in real life before. The thing is the name of the animal sounds almost exactly like a swear word in English. They started yelling that word to eachother, and to me in a very happy/ innocent way, just extremely excited that they'd seen this animal, because they very rarely see wildlife like that where we live normally.\n\nThey got a *few* funny looks from older people and families, but I think in general people realised that they weren't English and weren't swearing. I decided not to say anything to them because I didn't want to spoil their enjoyment (they were SO happy), I didn't think it was a big deal, and the place we were wasn't *packed* with people, there were only a few other families around.\n\nAnyway, my aunt had other ideas and stormed over there and started loudly telling them off/ shouting at them (which they didn't understand a word of). I ran over too and put myself between them and her, because they both looked terrified, and told her loudly to leave them alone, and that they're not swearing, and that they don't understand her. We had a fairly angry falling out, and she stormed off back to my parents (who didn't hear any of this, they were queuing up to buy ice cream).\n\nI explained to the boys what had happened, and they were both quite upset and embarrassed to think they'd done something wrong, even though they hadn't, and it put a dampner on their day. They keep asking me if they're saying any rude words when they speak now and it hurts my heart a bit to know their excitement has been dimmed.\n\nMy parents think my aunt overreacted but also think I shouldn't have yelled at her. I think she was being ridiculous and had no right to tell them off, and should've spoken to me if she had a problem. When we got home, she told me she expects me and the boys to apologise to her. I told her to fuck off.\n\nAITA for not apologising?\n\nEdit: Just realised it's confusing - Alex and Sam are my husband's nephews biologically and aren't related to my aunt in any way except for through me. They've never met her before, and probably won't meet her again.", "created_utc": 1678466561, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11nu26c/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_off_for_yelling_at_my/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The Aunt is not related to the children. She has no right to yell at them and you have a right to defend them as you are (even if by marriage). They are children and English isn\u2019t their first language. She blew up and you responded.\n\nINFO: Are Sam and Alex the children of the aunt? I think from your post that they aren't but would like to confirm.", "NTA\n\nI'm proud of you for standing up for your nephews, especially since they are little kids. The kids shouldn't have to apologize since they didn't do anything wrong. It was good that you calmy explained the situation, but they aren't the ones who need to apologize.\n\nI wish more people stood up for kids if they were being yelled at (you know when parents outright scream and make a scene) in public. I know people say \"it's none of your business\", but having an adult make sure everything is ok is important.", "NTA... your aunt honestly sounds like a hateful racist.

Good on you for defending your nephews.  \n\nEven if they did speak English, there are better ways of getting kids to stop swearing.  No need to scream at them in public.  Your aunt is an a$$.  She should apologize to the boys - bearing gifts.", "NTA, aunt just sounds like an old school disciplinarian in a situation where that's not really called for.  Plus it's hard not to yell someone off when they're currently yelling themselves.  Your parents are probably just saying everyone was in the wrong as a compromise which is always BS.", "NTA - auntie needs to just fuck off just as you told her.", "Info:  What curse word does it sound like?   Depending on the word truthfully, you may be am AH for not stopping them from saying it when there are other kids around.", "Good for you for standing up to her.  She had not right to speak to those boys that way.  She's no relation nor is she any kind of care giver.  What gives her the right?  I', sorry for the boys that there fun was taken away by a wanker.", "NTA--- You stuck up for those boys, and you were their voice when they could not speak, good on you!", "NTA your aunt is a grown woman expecting adult reactions from children. She doesn't have the authority to yell at them especially if she's not biologically related to them. You did an amazing job as their aunt by putting her in her place. \n\nThe kids can't speak English and even if they could- they're under 8. It wasn't that serious for your aunt to react that way. Great job handling it.", "NTA. Poor kids", "NTA.  Your aunt was out of line.  Good for you protecting your nephews.  Don't apologize.", "NTA\nFair play to you for standing up to her. She needs to reel it in and cop on to herself.", "I'd say NTA.\n\nAssuming your Aunt (now) knows that English is not their Mother Tongue and assuming it has been explained to her that what your Nephews were saying/yelling was a direct translation of the animal and they were just innocently exited (as you explain). \n\nI actually find it hard to understand why **she** hasn't apologised to the children for her outburst and not expecting terms to be the other way round.", "NTA but your Aunt is and why the F does she think the boys also need to apologise to you?", "NTA...The aunt is the adult and should know when a child is doing something innocently or not. A calm teaching moment is wasted when you're getting screamed at.", "NTA. Sounds like the aunt was trigger happy to yell at that for something.", "NTA. Your aunt had ABSOLUTLEY no right to talk to those children like that. SHE is not related to them in any way and I would have said much worse.", "NTA obviously but\n\nI wanted to reply to this:\n\n>hey keep asking me if they're saying any rude words when they speak now\n\nIt's important to address this, both with your nephews and with their parents. This seems really small to us, as adults, but to young children it can become a huge issue, both with the child's speech development in their first language *and* with learning any additional languages. \n\nI'd make it *very* clear that they did not in fact say any rude words, and that some people do not understand that sounds mean different things in other languages. That Aunt was the one in the wrong, not just for the yelling, but in her assumptions. And that they did a really good job identifying the seals! (Assuming they are seals, because I can't think of anything closer to a \"rude word\" off the top of my head, lol.)", "> I told her to fuck off.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your aunt is wildly off the rails with that behaviour.  \n\nBut if your nephews are yelling something (that sounds) very offensive in public, why wouldn't you just take the chance to teach them an English word for the animal?
