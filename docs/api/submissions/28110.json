He makes $150,000. There is no where in the US where I could afford to live on my own. \nDon't do this to yourself. \nHe has moved you and isolated you from all your supports. \nHe knew this would be an issue for your education and insisted on going anyway.\nHe is wanting you to fail. \nHe wants you stuck, home,  barefoot. Pregnant and child rearing doing all the domestic help.  Dependantand stuck. Period. Nothing required from him. Parenting house, all mental load is yours to carry.  He had no responsibility.  You have all\nIf you choose to do that. Get a post nuptials so you have some support", "Not to mention a move like that with a 5 month old. I somehow doubt he\u2019s helping at night. Studying becomes even more difficult when you\u2019re not sleeping.", "I agree. This is a classic move for abusers. OP- get out now. Even if he never showed abusive behavior in the past, this is his opportunity- he knows you are in a tough spot right now", "Actually the only gold we can give now, thanks Reddit.", "MINOR? Her ability to study for 1 mth for a rest to put her DOCTORATE in practice to make six figures versus destroy a six figure career to do a menial low wage job instead? That's a life destroying choice not a minor disagreement. You are an idiot to think otherwise.", "He is isolating and sabotaging you. Get your certificate and get out before you find yourself in a bad situation.", "Personally, I would offer to move back home with your kids and continue to work (part time if needed) and study and he can visit on the weekend. Or he can deal with paying for childcare. This would absolutely have me rethinking the relationship as well.", "Put your availability as swing shift 2-10pm only, let him handle pick up and evenings with his children.", "Please listen to everyone on this thread.  I'd pack right up and move back to where I could work as a pharmacist.  That is a serious profession and he wants to put you in a position where you have a minimum wage job?  Do you have family where you came from.  I'd head right back there with the kids and sue for child support.  Try and get some of his position on texts.  Sounds extreme - you can see from my comments I'm not extreme.  I'm in a 20 year marriage where my wife went back to school for a different graduate degree while I supported the family - so she could be happy!  What you are experiencing is NOT normal.", "i have friends who argue like your husband. its maddening. people who throw logic out the door to win an argument by any means possible.", "OP, it seems like  she wants you to fail or feel less than. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with working fast food, but for you to have a career and him to blatantly sabotage you? Red flag \ud83d\udea9 for sure!! So, sit him down and ask him if he wants a divorce, because if he does, you\u2019re happy to get the support and alimony and then you can take alllll the time you need to pass the exam. If he\u2019s a jerk and sees that would cost more $ and stops hounding you- I suggest you take and pass the exam like a boss. And then leave him once you have a cushion.", "you fed the troll", "she doesn't HAVE a career\n\nHE DOES\n\nHE provides for the household\n\nSHE does nothing", "Back when I was in the home stretch of studying for the bar, both times, I was pulling ten hour days at least. The exam is a month out, so home stretch.  By the time she even did the onboarding for McDonalds or whatever, she\u2019s looking at being close to the exam, so even applying is useless. \n\nLicensure exams aren\u2019t always just when you want to take them.", "Dude. Leave him.\n\nIt'll suck for a while, but then he'll have to pay you alimony. Come up with a plan to go back to school - judge might make him pay for your school and support.\n\nGet out. The sooner you do, the sooner you can move on and be happy.", "Can you leave him?", "Wow", "Honestly I too would strongly reconsider the longevity of this relationship but probably wouldn\u2019t even bother with the new exam. I\u2019d just move back where I was already certified. Old state will retain jurisdiction for child custody and division of assets since they haven\u2019t lived in CA long enough for it to take it.\n\n(Edit for clarity)", "Because he doesn't let her. She's a pharmacist and just need this fucking exam to go back to work. He doesn't let her", "Not so much they since she wanted to wait and pass the exam first.", "how long do you think it takes to type a single post?", "So true. I dated a few guys in tech who had such low self esteem that they thought every woman was after their money. How sad.", "I work as a woman in tech. There's a very good reason I've always dated outside my field.", "Wrong again.\n\nWoman's got kids that she puts in daycare to 'study'. You don't need THAT much time to 'study' for a test a month away.\n\nShe simply just wants to abandon all responsibility. that much is obvious", "Raw time by itself  is not the issue, it is showing a lack of dedication with divided attention, her attention is already divided with kids and ''doing chores'', so I cannot see a serous person giving herself the privilege of moaning on reddit.", "> You don't need THAT much time to 'study' for a test a month away.\n\nSounds like someone who has never taken a licensure exam. I pulled 8-10 hour days for three months the first time I took the bar, and for a month when I took it in my second state.\n\nAnd when she passes it in a month and starts working again, the kids will be going right back to daycare.", "LMAOOOO you spent the last 6 hours commenting on this ONE post Jesus christ man get a life. Even if the PHD fan fic you wrote about yourself is true you clearly have no friends or social life if this is what you do all day. Talking about \"give me 30 minutes I have things to do\" like what? Go argue with other strangers in the same reddit post?", "> I took the bar\n\nThe bar is NOT a 'pharmacists exam'. Not even in the same league. Of COURSE, you're going to need to devote quite a bit of time to studying for that. Duuh! You're also going to end up with a lucrative position, if you're talented enough\n\nA pharmacists exam? Yeah, Walmart, Target, CVS are hiring. You'll get $15/hr anyways, and it's NOT that complicated of a test. The difference between the two is night and day.", "You\u2019re confusing pharmacy tech with pharmacist.\n\nAnd I do public interest work, so not making bank.", "Pharmacists make more like 70-100$/hr\u2026 or between 150-200k per year.\n\nPharm techs make less and as you described.", "What kind of above minimum wage job is going to hire someone who's clearly going to leave within a few months when they get certified?", "Selfish assholes indeed can earn a lot of money. It isn't mutually exclusive you absolute asshat.", "That's your choice as a lawyer, and no I'm not. Really, I'm not. The jobs are going to the same companies. Maybe not exactly the same job title, but they really are going to the same companies", "Yeah no\n\nPrepare to be underwhelmed. You're not even going to come close to that. There may be the POSSIBILITY of that, but you're literally going to be stuck in retail hell. Maybe not as a counter tech, but yes, you're headed to retail hell. You'll be lucky to pull $30/hr", "No but I do know a lot about passing exams, and studying hard. And moaning on reddit is not a winning strategy.", "I do not know. Did she try to find out before going with the ''oh woe is me I am forced to make a choice most dire, a minimum wage job forever or sit on my ass studying''?", "My mentally midget friend. I did not say that selfish people can't make money I am saying that a selfish man wouldn't bust his ass and put 250k on the table for his ungrateful wife and two kids.", "An entry level pharmacist at Walgreens makes between $40 and $70 an hour. Not $15.", "There are no pharmacist making 60k here. Not a single one who is full time. Maybe if they worked 2 days a week.\n\nNot in retail, not in hospitals. I recommend you look up pharmacist vs pharmacy techs since you seem to be really confused about the two."]}
