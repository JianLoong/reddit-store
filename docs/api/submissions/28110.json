Yikes.\n\nNTA.", "NTA you are working toward a good job in your field, and still contributing with childcare. He is being unreasonable after forcing you to move before you were ready.", "NTA Your husband is a massive misogynistic asshole. He wants you to get a minimum wage job thus preventing you from studying to get a job in your field? And the test is only like a month away? Sounds like he wants to be the big income earner and keep you poor. Yuck.", "unaware? im not buying it i smell sabotage. \n\nNTA", "Yea that's a GREAT advice. Threaten to divorce him over a minor disagreement. Reaching for the nuclear option at a hats drop will surely help him understand her position.", "Kick rocks in flip flops.\n\nIt's perfect.", "[removed]", "Exactly my thoughts. There\u2019s a clear timeline in place here. This isn\u2019t a \u201cI\u2019ll take the test or get a job when I feel like it\u201d situation. OP didn\u2019t want to move until they were already able to start applying to jobs and getting a temp job/being daycare is not out of necessity. \n\nNTA", "Yea screw the children they don't deserve a family miss'us must pursue her dreams.", "Once kids show up the reality of how much work, and money, they are can hit like a tonne of bricks.  Husband is probably reacting & deciding he wants a wife who stays home full time with the kids, but the fast food work suggestion is weird, it almost sounds like financial abuse, it makes completely no sense!", "This whole thing is so insane I think OP is having a hard time wrapping her head around it.  I sure hope she keeps studying!!!", "She\u2019s not a student. She\u2019s a doctoral level professional who is already licensed in at least one state, and is attempting to gain licensure in a second. Of course she was a damned good student in the past to get where she is. Sheesh.", "I was wondering the same thing. 8 hours is a long time to be studying.\n\nThe kids are in daycare all day, and OP can't get a part time job for 3-4 of 8 hours a few days a week? There's also no mention of savings, debt, mortgage, or mention of anything her husband takes care of or how their finances work.  Bay area child care can be like 800-2k/mo per child, and that also depends on whether they go to the same daycare because a lot don't take children under 2 years.\n\nBut I also want to know how long they've known about the promotion/moving and when she began studying in relation to that or if she had a job at that time.\n\nIt doesn't even sound like it was a conversation of why he wants her to work. Did they purchase a house they can't afford? Is he floundering at his job?", "She did.", "The plan was for OP to study to take the test that will allow her to work in the field she went to university for. Now OP's husband wants her to work a minimum wage fast food job, or become a SAHM, neither of which was the plan when she upended her life to move to California like he wanted.", "OP is overqualified for a minimum wage job. She has earning power of $150,000+ as a pharmacist. She was certified in another state but needs to study the state certification. It doesn\u2019t make sense for her to give up $125,000+ worth of earning power to work a part time job.  Her husband was the one who wanted to move for a promotion so he should be understanding while she prepares for the test.  \n\nPeople who work minimum wage jobs are important and necessary. However, this woman spent many years in university to become a pharmacist, a profession that is also necessary.", "It's in the post. She has time now BECAUSE of daycare, but husband wants her to either find a minimum wage job and pay for it or take the children out and be a sahm.", "Yeah, this does have the makings of early signs of financial and possibly emotional abuse doesn't it.", "I bet he thinks she is staying home so she can go fuck other guys now that the kids are in day care and that is why he wants the kids home. Or a job. So she has to be somewhere.", "He forced her to move states, and is now trying to sabotage her career.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She's not trying to become a professional ballerina or something.", "Why don\u2019t you say the same thing about the husband working? He\u2019s the one who moved the whole family to a new state to begin with.", "Yea screw the children they don't deserve a family dudebro gotta work up the ladder and uproot their life /s", "His logic is so flawed. He is hiding his actual reasoning behind whatever this nonsense is he is saying. But what the hell is his real motivation for doing this?", "Not necessarily. I was a damn good student of molecular biology earning my Bachelors in Molecular biology and physiology as the 3rd ranked student in my generation and finished my Masters in human molecular genetics. I am not a good PhD student, my PhD studies have coincided with my lab work as an Research Assistant, and I have simply lost the knack for hard studying, life happened, I got engaged, long work hours at the lab, more familial responsabilities, project work, my  PhD fell a bit on the wayside. And I have used my previous success as a internal justification for my poor performances with my PhD. So no, when we are talking about studying previous successes do not necessarily indicate future success. Also, come on, minimal wage or CPJE? You honestly believe that? It sounds like a false binary. Do you need CPJE to work at a lab? To be a sales representative? I am honestly curious.", "It's not even that early- she's in a place where she can't easily get sufficient income for her individual needs or build up a personal savings.", "I am an idiot I miseread paying for child care as child support. Sorry. Actually sound advice, if we assume the OP is studying hard and not screwing around and using ''studying'' as an excuse for not being a SAHM.", "I am referring to the ludacrious advice of divorce for a minor disagrement. Also he did not move his whole family, they moved their whole family. Also about his dream, his ''dream'' job (we are of course assuming he likes his job and did not take a job he dislikes for the sake of his family) is providing for the whole family. If they were without children OK, spliting up maybe wouldn't be the worst advice, but now that ship has sailed unless you wanna now ruin your kids childhood (which divorces have tendency of doing). I apologize if my snide comment about the miss'us was unclear.", "Yes dude bro is putting bread on the table while sista lady is not and might newer be. We assume that she is studying hard while she is obvously wasting her time on social media seeking validation.", "I've seen a few people suggest he thinks she's cheating while he's at work, sadly I find this very likely since he's surrounded by tech bros. Unfortunately misogyny is still very common in the tech field (even in offices with a good rate of female hires, women adopt this attitude as well), as well as the attitude that women only sleep with nerds for their money (beta bucks) but are sleeping around any time that big earning nerd turns his back lmao. It's a very online attitude but tech bros do tend to spend a lot of time at the computer. Maybe his new co-workers teased him when they found out what his wives was up to.", "She already has her doctorate. She is no longer a student. I\u2019m not sure why you don\u2019t understand that.\nShe is already licensed in at least one other state.\nThat\u2019s the whole point of this. \nYou need to get licensed per state in the United States in the medical field: she is merely trying to obtain a new license in the state she currently resides.\n\nShe\u2019s a pharmacist, why the hell would she be working in a lab or as a sales rep of all things lol when she can be making bank in a hospital, retail, or industry setting.", "She already is doing all the childcare during 2/3 of the day and all the chores whole he does jack shit. Who is screwing around here?", "You are projecting lol you didn't achieve much in life, huh?", "He\u2019s working, not doing jack shit", "250k a year is not Jack Shit, not in my book, not my a long shoot. Also there is ''doing chores' and housemaking. If she is staying home is expect damn good housemaking not ''chores'' she is not child.", "Why do you assume that? Unlike the OP I am on my day off killing some time. I am just finishing my PhD in molecular genetics, I will defend the PhD at the begging of next year? I am a research assistant. When I studied hard I did not use Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube or any other social media platform, I have earned my leisure time. Can you say the same for the OP? I cannot.", "He is doing jack shit around the house and with the children. Even if she was a sahm he should be doing half the chores or paying for someone to do them.", "She is not \"staying home\", you piece of wood, she is studying to continue the very lucrative career that she studied hard to achieve and had to sacrifice for this selfish asshole.", "Damn you sound like you are projecting \ud83d\ude06", "Since you\u2019ve made up everything about OPs wife and how lazy she is on social media; I\u2019ll just assume you\u2019re making up everything about yourself. If you were a phd student surely you wouldn\u2019t be wasting time on Reddit like a degenerate. My goodness, fantasy lane in your head must be a wild place.", "Aha, studying, aha, So hard she is petrified of the test but also finds time to farm approval on this subreddit. When I studied hard going on forums was not in my wildest dreams. Also ''selfish assholes'' do not put 250k on the table. Also I have to take a test or minimal wage is a false binary used to emotionally manipulate the tone of this discussion. You honestly believe you need the licensee to for, example, do labwork? Be a sales person? You are being emotionally manipulated.", "I am not a good PhD student. Sorry to disapoint you. Also I have already written my papers, and the better part of the thesis so it is easy sailing for me. Also OP is the wife. Also I am did not make up that she is on social media, she obviously is. About being lazy, that is my perception.", "Wait til you hear that most doctors have time to meet friends and have a social life while studying for their Speciality Placement Test! The horror! Such lazy stupid people!", "You might be shocked to learn that selfish assholes have a much higher warning potential than the average person lmao. How much money he makes has nothing to do with who he may or may not be as a person. He knew when he decided to move that she would not be able to work until she passed her exam, according to op he had the option to put off the move by a few months while she did that, so even if ops husband is a very kind an generous man 99% of the time, the fact that he made an informed decision and is now reneging on that deal when its too late for her to turn back, while speaking to op in a demeaning way, is in fact selfish and asshole behavior.\n\nI've seen you comment a bunch of times about people suggesting divorce but you're also speaking in support of the husband who has put her in a position where the only options to get out of this argument are to do what he says and give up her career, or leave her family and go back to a state where she is able to work a proper job. I also agree that divorce is not the answer, the answer is the husband living with his own decision for a few months until she gets back on her feet, because that's what happens when one partner makes a career move that requires the other to quit their job without enough lead time to line up a new one in the new location. If they're hurting for cash then he should have thought of that before the move.", "So you know absolutely nothing about professional licensing exams. Got it.", "My perception of you is your a lazy fraud. Aren\u2019t assumptions fun?", "Yes, also a job.", "Yes they actually are, you are amusing me quite a bit. And don't be shy lay down you critique. So I don't give an perception I am ignoring you, I will be able to respond in about 30 minutes I have something to do. Then we will continue with this exhilarating conversation in full."]}
