You\u2019re actively working towards a career in your new state. He can kick rocks in flip flops if he cannot see and appreciate that.", "NTA - you ARE contributing to the household financially. You are saving him a fortune in housekeeping services, chef's services, laundry services, etc. all while studying for what sounds like a very difficult exam. Once you have completed the professional exam, you will be contributing even MORE financially. \n\nYou are not struggling financially at this time, and once you have completed this exam and are actually working in your profession once again, will more than compensate for the time that you were \"freeloading\".\n\nPersonally, I'd wait until you wrote the exam, got your professional license for CA, and then kick him to the kerb, while suing for child support, but I'm petty that way. (BTW, CA is a 50/50 state when it comes to the division of marital assets)", "NTA\n\nThis looks like some kind of financial abuse situation. All I see is him making it impossible for you to get your professional certification and calling you ridiculous names when you are rational.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being pennywise and pound foolish. It's so incredibly shortsighted it seems like there's got to be another motive for pushing for something so silly.", "NTA. You are not a freeloader. You are studying to pass a difficult exam so that you can continue your career. Your husband is being unreasonable and trying to remove your options in the future.\n\nIf he makes 250K he should be able to pay 25K in child care to allow you to pursue your dreams.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a heavy-duty relationship issue. You probably should get professional guidance. I'm not sure AITA is qualified to advise on this.\n\nPresumably, a few months from now, you'll be able to contribute at a higher level and be more fulfilled in your chosen career. Unless there is some secret, immediate financial crisis, this isn't about money. It's either about control or a misguided idea about what's fair. \n\nWe would all want a supportive partner who helps us to pursue our goals fully and freely. If he is not that, I don't know how you change that about him.\n\nTry not to put so much pressure on yourself about the test. If you need to retake it in a couple of months, that's not a failure, only a minor delay. This transitional era of your life will soon be long behind you.\n\nGood Luck!", "NTA\n\nThis should be a non-issue.  You are STUDYING for a career that will pay six figures.  In order to realize this career you have to kick ass on an upcoming test that takes place in 34 days?\n\nThe best use of your time is studying for the Exam not flipping burgers.  It makes absolutely no fucking sense whatsoever to risk a $150k CAREER just so you can earn $1200 at McDonalds.    \n\nYou aren't talking about 1 year of study, you are talking about a month.  one month.  \n\nHonestly, I think the problem with your husband is something else.  \n\nDid his mom work?  Did his last girlfriend (prior to your marriage) cheat on him?  Did someone in his family recently die.  Because his position makes absolutely no fucking sense.  \n\nHim wanting you to work a minimum wage job as this critical juncture is akin to a farmer eating his seed corn for the year just so he can have popcorn for a movie he wants to watch. \n\nNegotiate that you will work a minimum wage job if you fail the test twice in a row.  If the test is every 2 months, and you fail in Nov, next Test would be in January.  Tell him if you fail this upcoming test and the test in January then you'll work a minimum wage job.\n\nAnother avenue is you can take the money you \"would have made\" working minimum wage and that money is a debt you owe the family that you promise to pay back by end of 2024 and come 2024 you take that money and have a family vacation or something.", "NTA this seems like extremely controlling and manipulative behavior on his part. He didn\u2019t listen to your concerns about moving so quickly\u2026you accommodated his work goals and now he wants to put you in a position that makes it next to impossible to reach yours. He is being a selfish and misogynistic jerk.", "NTA but you need marital counseling asap.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is an asshole and I'd consider leaving his petty ass.\n\nWhen I moved to California it took me two tries to pass the cpje. We were living off savings but did my husband tell me to get a job to contribute anything? No.", "NTA, but he is for calling you a free loader.", "So NYA.  It really appears that he either wants a SAHM or he wants to take away your financial freedom.\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t this discussed before the move?", "OMG he is ridiculous and can't consider the longer term results.

He would be the laughing stock of his entire office.\n\nFreeloading? Know who yall marry, yall.", "NTA.  He didn't take your concerns into consideration.  He just did what was best for him, not best for the family.  I'm with you.  It's better to live frugally and put the time into studying to improve your chances of passing the exam.  The little bit you would earn from a part-time job (assuming they didn't say you were overqualified and give the job to someone else) is negligible compared to your earning power once you pass the test.  I would be concerned about someone trying to push you into being a SAHM with little to no earning power/potential.  Stand firm.  No job until you have passed the test.", "You should have negotiated this before the move but Nta.
