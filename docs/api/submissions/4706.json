{"id": 4706, "submission_id": "zlp5nd", "title": "AITA for not changing our Christmas tradition for my DIL?", "selftext": "I am a 45 year old woman with 3 sons. Dave (30M), Corbyn (20M) and Alex (18M). My husband (49M) is dad to Corbyn and Alex but stepdad to Dave.  Dave lives about 10 hours away from us if we were to drive, so we don\u2019t see him at all outside of when he comes to visit us for the holidays. Dave has been dating my DIL, Kayla (28F), for the last 10 years. \n\nWe have only met Kayla a handful of times because  she is very introverted and typically visits her own family when Dave visits us. This year, Dave has managed to get her to agree to join us for Christmas. I can\u2019t say any of us are especially excited about that, myself especially. Kayla and I have never seen eye to eye and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a good fit for my boy. I never have. There have also been issues with her finding out about things I\u2019ve said to Dave and taking offence and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fully over it. The woman just gets under my skin. But she is who he has chosen and I have to be okay with that so I\u2019m always cordial to her face. \n\nThe issue: Dave called me this morning and wanted to talk about Christmas. He asked if we could change our Christmas tradition since Kayla will be joining us. We live in a gorgeous area that\u2019s brilliant for hiking so every year on Christmas Day as a family we go for an approximately 10 mile hike before getting ready and going out to dinner. Dave reminded me that Kayla has mild cerebral palsy that gets worse in cold weather so she struggles with any sort of distance walking, and is pregnant. I said I didn\u2019t care if she was the queen of England, she could come and suck it up or not come and not be here for Christmas as I didn\u2019t trust her alone in the house.  Dave\u2019s response was \u201cwell, you\u2019ve just solidified everything she thought about you\u201d and then he hung up. \n\nI may be the AH here because I then messaged Kayla to let her know it was okay to go to her parents if the thought of a little exercise on Christmas Day made her so uncomfortable she had to get my son to call me and try to change it. When I got home a couple of hours later, my husband said that Dave had called the landline and was furious, and that what I said was totally inappropriate. I told him I didn\u2019t think so and he said \u201cwell, it\u2019s your funeral when Kayla doesn\u2019t want the baby around you\u201d and that comment hurt as he knows how excited I\u2019ve been. \n\nMy sons both agree with me but directed me here. They are more tech inclined than we are. AITA for keeping traditions alive as much as DIL hates them?\n\nTldr: I won\u2019t change my families tradition for my overweight DIL. My eldest son is mad. No one else really cares.\n\nEDIT: I am not calling Kayla overweight because she is pregnant!!! I would never!!! Kayla is a large woman, like \u201ccould safely stand to lose 100 pounds\u201d large.", "created_utc": 1671019289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlp5nd/aita_for_not_changing_our_christmas_tradition_for/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But now, you're salty about the natural consequences to your own actions when you're being explicitly told your AH behaviour could cause them to not want you around their new baby. \n\n*No shit, Sherlock.*\n\nIf you can't even pretend to be a decent human to its mother, why would they want a controlling, entitled and abusive person around their kid?\n\nYou are a colossal AH.

Those sons still live with you. Hahaha,  no, they do not agree with you. They just know better than to go against you and wanted the internet to do it for them.

You obviously dislike her enough that you can barely bring yourself to be civil to her and have basically told her you have no interest in making any room in your family for her or her needs.  \n\nDIL is fully aware of this and was willing, probably for the sake of your son's happiness, to give it another try to see if some good will could emerge from another visit.  You shut that down for the sake of some precious tradition and told her you'd be just as happy if she didn't attend.  \n\nAnd you think these people are going to welcome you to spend time with their child?  I hope they create family traditions of their own that make it impossibly difficult for you to participate in that child's life, and tell you you're welcome to stay home when you ask for the smallest accommodation or consideration.", "YTA. No doubt about it.

How can you claim to love your grandchild while being so nasty and unloving towards the child's mother? Are you one of those people who thinks the child is 100% your son's and your DIL is just a human 3D printer? Newsflash, that child is 50% their mother. If you so blatantly hate their mother, that child WILL know you hate 50% of them.\n\nLet me tell you something. My stepgrandmother played these kinds of nasty petty games with my mother when I was growing up. Do you know what she achieved? I hated my stepgrandma and I don't miss her at all now that she's gone. My mother is the one who birthed me, fed me, bathed me, took care of me when I was sick, *raised me.* Stepgrandma was just some jerk who made everyone else miserable. And if you're mean to my mom I have no love for you.\n\nYou may be excited about a grand*baby* but that child will not stay a baby forever.

Dave (30M), Corbyn (20M) and Alex (18M). My husband (49M) is dad to Corbyn and Alex but stepdad to Dave.  Dave lives about 10 hours away from us if we were to drive, so we don\u2019t see him at all outside of when he comes to visit us for the holidays. Dave has been dating my DIL, Karen (28F), for the last 10 years. \n\nWe have only met Karen a handful of times because  she is very introverted and typically visits her own family when Dave visits us. This year, Dave has managed to get her to agree to join us for Christmas. I can\u2019t say any of us are especially excited about that, myself especially. Karen and I have never seen eye to eye and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a good fit for my boy. I never have. There have also been issues with her finding out about things I\u2019ve said to Dave and taking offence and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s fully over it. The woman just gets under my skin. But she is who he has chosen and I have to be okay with that so I\u2019m always cordial to her face. \n\nThe issue: Dave called me this morning and wanted to talk about Christmas. He asked if we could change our Christmas tradition since Karen will be joining us. We live in a gorgeous area that\u2019s brilliant for hiking so every year on Christmas Day as a family we go for an approximately 10 mile hike before getting ready and going out to dinner. Dave reminded me that Karen has mild cerebral palsy that gets worse in cold weather so she struggles with any sort of distance walking, and is pregnant. I said I didn\u2019t care if she was the queen of England, she could come and suck it up or not come and not be here for Christmas as I didn\u2019t trust her alone in the house.  Dave\u2019s response was \u201cwell, you\u2019ve just solidified everything she thought about you\u201d and then he hung up. \n\nI may be the AH here because I then messaged Karen to let her know it was okay to go to her parents if the thought of a little exercise on Christmas Day made her so uncomfortable she had to get my son to call me and try to change it. When I got home a couple of hours later, my husband said that Dave had called the landline and was furious, and that what I said was totally inappropriate. I told him I didn\u2019t think so and he said \u201cwell, it\u2019s your funeral when Karen doesn\u2019t want the baby around you\u201d and that comment hurt as he knows how excited I\u2019ve been. \n\nMy sons both agree with me but directed me here. They are more tech inclined than we are. AITA for keeping traditions alive as much as DIL hates them?\n\nTldr: I won\u2019t change my families tradition for my overweight DIL. My eldest son is mad. No one else really cares.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are acting like a JustNoMIL.", "YTA and it brings me joy to know you will never see the grandchild you are so excited about, all because you are a judgmental abilist trash human.", "YTA she has cerebral palsy and she's pregnant, you are talking abt a 10 mile hike!

You\u2019re insisting she march 10 miles while pregnant? Do you hear yourself?\n\nLook, some people just don\u2019t get along. That\u2019s fine. But you\u2019ve crossed the line into some pretty aggressive antagonism. You don\u2019t have to change your tradition, but insisting that each and every person spend a full four hours in the woods with you is beyond excessive. YTA, and you need to decide whether you want to have anything like a relationship with your son going forward, or whether you want to keep playing passive-aggressive drill sergeant.", "YTA.

I imagine he will be coming a lot less frequently in future and that he will ensure that he protects his wife and child by keeping them away from you as well.\n\nTraditions aren\u2019t set in stone. A 10 mile hike isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s idea of fun even if they don\u2019t have disability. The adult thing to have done would have been to arrange the hike for a different day, or to *ask* your son whether he and he wife would be happy staying home while the rest of you went out, or if they would prefer to prioritise having some time together with the family, and for the hike to happen on a different day.\nAlso, your nastiness about your daughter in law? Maybe you don\u2019t like her, but you have said nothing  to suggest that she\u2019s done anything wrong. Accept that she is the person your son lives, try to get to know her and accept her as a part of the family, or you will find that you are no longer part of your son or grandchild\u2019s family.\nMAYBE if you make a genuine, sincere apology to your son and DIL now, without making excuses, and follow through by offering to accommodate the needs and preferences of your guests, rather than imposing your\u2019 \u2018traditions\u2019 despite knowing they are  not suitable for the whole family, you MIGHT be able to repair some of the damage you have done, and rebuild some sort of relationship with your son, but you will need to genuinely adjust your attitude.", "Yes, YTA.  Let me count the ways:\n\nYou talked poorly about your DIL to your son, thinking he wouldn\u2019t tell her. You\u2019re not entitled to ask committed partners to keep secrets from one another. \n\nYou spoke rudely to your daughter-in-law thinking she would get over it. Laughable. \n\nYou thought you\u2019d have a relationship with a child whose mother you\u2019ve openly disapproved of and trashed to your spouse? Ridiculous. \n\nYou\u2019re an entitled JustNoMIL.

Being a tradition doesn't mean it's right. You said you don't care if she's the Queen of England, which is a good indication of the poor attitude you've got toward her. You've given no indication of the massive character flaws she apparently has to justify your behaviour and attitude toward her, or explain why your son's 10 year girlfriend can't be trusted in your house alone. \nYou didn't even offer that they could both stay at home while you go out with the rest of the family, clearly you don't like her, you're hostile toward her, and despite her being the mother of your grandchild and your son's 10 year partner, you'll never see her as part of the family.\n\n>But she is who he has chosen and I have to be okay with that so I\u2019m always cordial to her face. \n\nIt's easy to write that, clearly much harder to practice.

My guess is she picked up on your not so subtle aversion  to her so she limits her time around you. As far as the 10 mile hike\u2026SHE HAS CEREBRAL PALSY and your nasty comment about her sucking it up was beyond\u2026well anything. Dave was right about you showing who you are. Take your excitement about their baby and change it to sadness and self reflection. I\u2019m sure they will not visit you again and since you don\u2019t drive to them, they won\u2019t have to be concerned about your dropping in unannounced whenever you want, taking over their home, monopolizing the baby, and criticizing Kayla as a mom.", "YTA. She is disabled and can\u2019t do this. It is more than a little exercise for her. You dislike her and show it at every turn. You don\u2019t fool her, your son or us.\n\nYou have already damaged your relationship with both of them so good luck with that! Doubt they will visit with the grandchild much and i hope they don\u2019t.", "YTA- you've clearly been making snide comments about her for years and you are completely unable to hide in a written post your utter disdain for her. I imagine in person that your contempt is utterly palpable. So, it's no surprise she doesn't care to be around you and her fuse where youre concerned is short.  That said- it's completely insane to me to ask/demand that your in-laws completely alter their family traditions-  so E.S.H. a little bit but you gave her no choice but to participate in an activity which she is likely physically unable to do or not to come because she can't be left in the house. \n\nYour husband is right. You're never meeting that child.", "I had to get my partner to weigh in on this because as someone with diplegic spastic CP, who\u2019s MIL also dislikes them, I was never going to be able to be objective. The consensus that we reached (suprise) is that holy fucking shit YTA.\n\nNews flash: I have mild CP. 2 days ago I walked around for a while (maybe 2km over a 6 hour period) and today I cannot move my left ankle it\u2019s so stiff and sore.  One of my best friends is a gym nut and she\u2019s incredibly fit - 10 miles isn\u2019t even a comfortable bike for her. For me? On the best day I could maybe manage a mile in the entire allotted time period. I would not be able to move for a few days afterwards. \n\nI have NO doubt that even if you don\u2019t know how far she can push herself you do know how far a pregnant woman should push themselves, and it ain\u2019t 10 miles I\u2019ll tell you that for nothing.\n\nJust tell your son you want nothing to do with his wife and move on, but don\u2019t expect your grand baby to be anything more than a picture to you. If I were Kayla I wouldn\u2019t be allowing my child anywhere near you and you\u2019d be very lucky if you ever got to meet them.", "is she overweight or does she have CP? why are you like this? is she gonna steal the silver while you're on your relaxing 10 mile hike?\nyou know YTA.", "YTA. Just say you hate your DIL and move on with your life instead of trying to defend yourself. Most people I know can't do a 10 mile hike in the middle of winter, nevermind while pregnant and disabled. You're being an absolutely horrid MIL. Disney would have a field day making a character about you. And we thought those evil stepmothers were bad \ud83d\ude02", "YTA. Don\u2019t be shocked when they don\u2019t want you round their child.", "YTA. \n\nShe isn't \"opposed to a little exercise\" she has an actual medical condition that means this hike doesn't work for her. And if she doesn't go on a 10 mile hike she can't come at all because you don't trust her in your home? So a woman, who is pregnant with the child you are excited for, cannot go on a cold weather hike because of a diagnosed medical condition, and you can't even let her sit at home on the couch. \n\nI hope you realize your attitude means you will not have any involvement with your grandchild. You won't make any accommodations for her, including just letting her stay in your home, so how do you think she is going to bring this kid around you? WHY would she bring this kid around you? You have mocked this woman's disability, her size, and told your son that it is more important to protect your valuables- FOR NO REASON- then it is to see him for the holidays. \n\nYou say \"no one else really cares\" but you do care. Your own actions mean your son- if he is smart- will never bother to visit you again. If your husband and other sons want any kind of relationship, and I do hope your sons read this, I hope they at least care. \n\nSo to them, I would say: Keyla may not be your cup of tea, she might be annoying and she may not even be very nice, but this is who your brother has chosen and it's not like you have to live with her on a daily basis. If you love your brother, you put up with stuff like this, because later in life, having siblings/cousins/whatever is such a great thing as you age and have families. At 40, I am so lucky to have my sister as my parents are aging, and I love my niece more than I ever thought I could. \n\nKeyla's medical condition is real, and she is pregnant, and both things make a 10 mile hike highly unlikely for her. She was happy to stay back, but your mother has decided she will steal all the silverware or something. You see this woman a few times a year, at most, and is it worth ruining your relationship with your brother over that? What your mother did was cruel, and by backing her, I hope you realize she will treat your partners the same way, and you will have to make a similar choice to what Dave is going through, and it is a horrible feeling.", "So let me get this straight. You: \n\u2022 hate your DIL who has been with your son for 10 years\n\u2022 don't trust her in your home for no logical reason\n\u2022 don't make her feel welcome in your home\n\u2022 don't take her medical condition and pregnancy into consideration\n\u2022 fat shame her\n\u2022 tell her to suck it up and join a 10 mile hike or not come at all. \n\nYou then expect to be a part of their baby's life who you're so \"excited\" about.
