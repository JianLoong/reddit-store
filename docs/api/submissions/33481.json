What a toad.", "> left him to entertain the kids.\n\nAnd there it is. The real reason he's pissed.\n\nHe thinks childcare is woman's work. He doesn't like being around his kids. His idea of \"relaxing\" is being nowhere near his kids. He doesn't *like* his kids.\n\nHe is a monumental arse and a bad father.\n\nI suggest that once you all get home, you sit him down and talk to him about this, and in particular about how you two should BOTH be parenting.\n\nYou, however, are NTA.", "NTA you did nothing wrong. He is abusive and weird. If he wanted to do something else he should of said so and planned it himself. Plus he complains about having to keep his own teenage kids entertained? The man needs a reality check", "2 teenagers and 1 toddler btw.", "NTA.  But you obviously didn't hear his subtext.  He wanted you to plan an activity HE wanted to do. So, you needed to read his mind and book only THOSE activities, not activities you thought the family would like.", "NTA\n\n Your husband is behaving like a spoilt child. and that makes him the AH here", "NTA\n\nI'm always surprised, that even long married couples still can't communicate with each other. I mean, did you tell your husband about the bookings? Either way, he always had the opportunity to say something. He choosed to not say anything. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA. He is being childish.", "Does he regularly behave like this? Your reaction to him very clearly being an arsehole is concerning. Do you normally pander to his temperature tantrums?\n\nHe's clearly punishing you for daring to take a nap and leave him with the kids.", "NTA. He's being indecisive and ruining the mood. You didn't do anything wrong and he's just acting immature.", "NTA.\n\nDon't bring him next year. Sounds like he's not interested in being a husband or father so why bother bringing him on a *family* holiday.\n\nThe kids are *teenagers* it's not like he was wrangling toddlers. Plus, even then, 1 hour? The average movie lasts longer than that.\n\nHe's just finding excuses to be miserable because everything didn't go 100% his way. Don't let him make you (and your kids) miserable too as a result. Especially on Christmas. \n\nI'd try talking to him again about the holiday and what he'd like to do, but if he still wants to be miserable and either not communicate or guilt trip you, then just exclude him.\n\nDon't wake him up, don't invite him on activities, and just do what you and your kids want instead. Will he still be bitter, whiny, and miserable about the whole thing? Probably. But at least you can give your kids a good Christmas and save yourself the trouble of worrying about someone who just wants to be a Grinch the whole time.\n\nYou might need to have a \"relationship talk\" when you get home though.\n\nBottom line: NOT.

So he is annoyed at you for \\*checks notes\\* having a nap so he had to be a parent for an hour as well as \\*checks notes\\* organising some activities as he has previously said you should. Besides, your kids are teenagers, how much 'entertaining' did he have to do for them? \n\nYou actually have two teenagers and a toddler. Unfortunately for you, you married the toddler. Ask him if he needs his nappy changed. The fact that you felt sick for most of the show is evidence that he does this sort of thing quite often and it is adversely affecting your health. It sounds  like emotional abuse - I could be wrong but that is the impression I get.", "NTA!!!!\n\nYou didn't leave him to do anything. He's their father!

You are literally damned if you do and damned if you don't with him. He complains you didn't plan things before, you plan things, he complains because he can't relax. God forbid he hangs out with his kids on his own or realizes that they're old enough to sit around and watch TV on their own for an hour.  You need to sit him down and have a serious conversation. He ruined his own night and holiday with his crappy attitude.
