He was a great dad in other ways, but he liked to have emotional control of the household. At some point in my teen years, I realized his moods, his silence and pouting, had absolutely NOTHING to do with what I did or didn't do. I don't know how I came to this realization, but it was game changing.\n\nSo, I would just shrug and stay out of his way and go about my business. I wouldn't let his mood affect my mood. He lost the power to control me through guilt. It was very freeing. I couldn't control his reactions, but I could control mine. And once he lost that power , he eventually stopped with the manipulation tactics.\n\nOne time I was home from college and he said something to my stepmom that had her doing something. As an aside to me, he said something like \"that doesn't work on you anymore, but it still does on her.\"\n\nThat was the first time I realized his actions were PURPOSEFUL and not just emotional immaturity, or being unable to control his moods (before that I figured things just changed when I became an adult and moved away/he mellowed with age, etc.)\n\nOP, your husband's actions are purposeful to keep you emotionally off balance and walking on egg shells. Don't give him that power over you and your kids. Instead of \"feeling sick\" and spending your time worrying about what you \"did wrong,\" you could just choose to go to the planned event with your kids and have fun.\n\nYou can't make your husband happy. He is the only one who can choose to enjoy and appreciate the life he has. His moods are not your responsibility to regulate. Let him be upset and go do your own thing with your kids and HAVE FUN doing it. \n\nNow, if you fear he will physically or emotionally threaten you for not cowering to his demands, then you need to plan your escape with your kids.\n\n But if he's just a moody, manipulative AH, you can get your power back by ignoring his tantrums and just go about your business. Invite him to join the family ONCE and then cheerfully accept a no. You might find that you all enjoy yourselves more without him. Ask for input on activities ONCE, and if he doesn't communicate what he wants, then make your own plans and execute them.\n\nNTA obviously", "OP you mentioned feeling sick, \u201cwhen this happens\u201d as if it\u2019s a common occurrence.\n\n does he often do this sort of thing? complain because you *should* have done something but later on complain that you did? get angry about things out of everybody\u2019s control but of which somehow you end being responsible? get volatile at points when you were supposed to be having fun and now everything feels tainted? \n\nif the answer is yes, you have bigger problems than that. the fact that you say YOU \u201cruined christmas holidays* because of rain and having an hour long nap -gasp, the humanity!- suggests that you\u2019re used to taking on blame for everything. \n\nNTA, and i\u2019d suggest individual therapy for you ASAP. NOT with your partner. THIS IS NOT NORMAL RELATIONSHIP BEHAVIOUR.", "Your husband is a dick. \n\nNTA", "Teenage kids don\u2019t need much if anything in terms of \u201cwatching \u201c.  Sounds like my ex who liked to throw passive aggressive tantrums like this and ruin everyone else\u2019s fun and he was always the victim no matter how much of a stretch he had to make to prove it.   Sorry you are married to an AH.  NTA", "I've always found it disgusting when a woman can't sleep around a man. There is zero reason and no acceptable excuse for being jaded about somebody/anybody that has taken an hour nap...vacation or not. This also flows into food for me... If you can't eat or sleep around a man without complaint, then you're in the wrong place. Sleep and food are not toys to be played with. Kids aren't either!!!!! The second he said, \"You took a nap,\" it would have escalated far beyond what he was upset about. From an outside perspective, he hates his family and is a miserable being. Some people just are miserable and will be victims of their environment every second. He has no happiness within himself and wants you to also have none. With all the energy being drained from her, it's no wonder she took a nap! Husband, whoever you are... you're lucky your wife and kids love you because nobody else will with you acting like that!!!", "NTA, but how long are you going to stick with this awful person who stops speaking to you because he expects you to read his ever changing mind and stresses you out so much? And he had to 'entertain' your teenage children while you napped for an hour? Unless he has a whole list of redeeming qualities, I really don't understand.", "So, you did nothing wrong. You took on the emotional labor of planning a vaca. Something he clearly doesn\u2019t do and yet has the nerve to be mad about what you planned. If he doesn\u2019t do anything he can\u2019t do it wrong, can he. \n\nyou gave him the option to not go but he decided to make a scene about it instead of just saying he didn\u2019t feel like it and staying behind to begin with. He is stonewalling you, which is a form of emotional abuse. \n\nI think you both need deep marriage counseling because it seems like your marriage is very unstable. You said you don\u2019t know what to do when this happens, meaning this has happened before. \n\nBeyond marriage counseling it sounds like it might be time to quit this whole thing. Are you really happy? Doesn\u2019t seem like you can be. He won\u2019t let you. NTA", "NTA.  This reminds me of how my therapist had to teach me that I am not responsible for another person's emotions and that I shouldn't take them onto myself.  Maybe do some reading up on that sort of thing?  It may be helpful for you.  \n\nYou did not do anything wrong.  Your husband is allowed to have his own feelings about things, and you are allowed to have your own, *even if they are different*.  Different feelings doesn't equal one of you being wrong and the other being right, and it seems that you were taking it that way (or maybe picking up on his desire that you take it that way, perhaps?).  Good for you for choosing to go in the end.  I'm sorry the whole situation was so hard on you.", "My husband and I are on vacation right now. About 4 days in, I started getting cranky, and once I figured out why, i told him it's because I felt I was never consulted on how I wanted to spend our time here. Every day was just wake up early and find activities, and I desperately wanted to just lay around and relax. He started asking me each day what I wanted to do, and we have been fine since then, and have been able to agree and/or compromise in a loving way.\n\n I'm wondering if you ever asked your husband about any of the activites, or what he wanted to do. If I were you, I would very nicely just ask him if there's anything he wants to do or even cancel in terms of activites, and find out if the issue is maybe as simple as his not feeling consulted. ESH, as this seems like a very classic case of not communicating. Just talk to him and be open to changing some plans.", "ESH. Neither of you are really communicating. You didn't involve him in the planning, he isn't communicating his feelings... you are just two ships passing in the night but expect to have the person on board with your plan. Start talking to each other before these things come up.", "Hey, so, does your husband have depression by any chance? Because his behavior sounds *exactly* how my friend used to act when he missed his meds. Obviously not an excuse for being an ass like he was, but it might be something to look into if this is out of character for him.\n\nNTA either way\n\nEdit after reading more of your comments:\nReading your other comments it sounds like this issue has been escalating for a while. I seriously suggest you each talk to therapists and maybe a marriage counselor when you are able", "Yta. Did you ask him before booking said show? Did he get a nap?", "ESH (except the kids). Did you discuss plans with your partner or just tell him what you\u2019ve planned? Your husband needs to be more flexible and open\u2026he wants to relax part of the time, fine but he should have been upfront before leaving on vacation.", "ESH: Don\u2019t you and your husband communicate about the trip before going? One year you didn\u2019t book anything and he got mad. First, he could have booked things. Second, it\u2019s not worth getting mad over if the point of the trip is spending family time together. So now you decided that instead of him being upset, you would book activities. I mean fine, but why wouldn\u2019t you discuss what activities you\u2019d all like to do, before booking them? \n\nWhen my BF and I travel he wants to play it by ear meanwhile I am a have planner. We have to compromise because we are in a relationship. However, since COVID so many things require advanced booking and it\u2019s harder to play it by ear if there\u2019s something someone really wants to do. The vacation can\u2019t just be the way I like it, so we TALK! \n\nBut your husband is a grown man and should not be giving you the silent treatment, pouting, or getting pissed at you for scheduling things when he previously was upset activities weren\u2019t schedule and he wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to schedule activities himself.", "So...   I'm thinking ESH.\n\nYour husband is definitely an asshole, if only for\n\n>That I had napped today ( for an hour) and left him to entertain the kids.\n\nAnd I'm sure a thousand  passive aggressive comments he'd made that trip.  God forbid he have to entertain the kids for an hour.   Plus they're teenagers,  they can entertain themselves as well.  They aren't toddlers... I mean honestly...  he's pretty childish to whine about \"oh you were sleeping for a whole HOUR!!!!!!!\"\n\nI am saying you are also an asshole because it didn't sound like you asked anyone what they wanted to do when you planned some activities.  a \"hey folks,  so we've got 10 things to choose from.  We've got a concert on night 1,  a organized snowball fight,  art museum,  a \"candy cane lane\" christmas lights drive thru thing... etc etc.   So which sounds good?  \", and give everyone, including the kids, some say in what to do (or what not to do ).  EDIT I will add that this cuts down on the last minute \"I don't WANNA GO!!!\", as everyone had input.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, Christmas concerts aren't everyone's bag (I am not a fan.   Granted no idea what kind of show we are talking about.  Professional big city orchestra?  Small community theater?  High school?  Elementary school?  unless the performers are REALLY REALLY good, I find Christmas concerts just so painful.  PEople \"oversinging\" the same freaking songs,  the 15 minute \"new approach\" rendition of The Little Drummer Boy,  ugh..  can't stand them ), so I can understand him not wanting to go.   That said, not sure why he wouldn't have mentioned not wanting to go, you know, sooner than right before you left.\n\nAnd... not knowing where you are at,  a 10 minute walk in the rain, with teenagers,  sounds pretty miserable.   I mean if you folks are in a warm place, maybe not so much,  but it is December, and so my mind goes to a \"its cold and raining and we are going to walk?  no\" place.\n\nNone of which fully justifies Hubby getting into what seems to be a pretty major twist about this.  I only mention all this to show I can see his point and you are not blameless here.\n\nSo ESH.  I will add that, based on your description,  hubby went from 0 to 100 with regard to this concert and your whole christmas excursion VERY VERY quickly.   While I realize there are quick to anger people out there,  it honestly feels like your description is missing some context, like some stuff had been left out.", "Because you're celebrating Christmas which is Jesus's birthday without any thought of him.

He is doing this to get a rise out of you, and to cow you.\n\nSo don't let him.\n\nMay I also suggest ***Lundy Bancroft's*** book titled ***Why Does He Do That?*** It is good, and should explain a lot of things your husband does to control you. It can be found for free on the internet, so please give it a chance.\n\nAnd start ignoring your husband.

Don\u2019t stress, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA, .  He is acting like a child, not a partner.  I cannot believe this is a unique occurrence given that you say, \"When this happens, I get super stressed out.\"  Meaning that it happens with some frequency, he bullies you.  Time to take serious stock of your relationship.  How many red flags are flying?  Does he take responsibility for things, or is everything your fault while he gets the credit when things go right?  Does he often refuse to communicate and give you the silent treatment?  Tell you one thing then change his mind and become upset that you didn't magically know?  Expect everything to go his way?  Act entitled?  Lay hands on you *in any way*?\n\nMaybe this is the only time this has happened and none of those others do.  But I strongly doubt it.  Those are signs of abuse, and most people -- women -- are trained not to see them, make excuses for them, take responsibility for them, put up with them.", "Agree, NTA. I would also add to this, my husband has ADHD and often gets overwhelmed by things, and this sets him into a terrible mood which truly has nothing to do with me. I used to be like you - get super anxious and feel like I can't enjoy anything and need to fix the situation and his mood. All this to say, he may not be intentionally manipulating you, but the same advice still stands. You don't have to let his mood dictate *your* mood or feelings. Go about your business, enjoy yourself with the kids and, frankly, feel good that he made a choice that he wanted to make if it doesn't negatively impact you. Maybe return to the conversation when he's had a chance to process (this is how my husband works, and I fully acknowledge that not everyone is coming from a good place through mental health struggles).

Constantly anticipating your partner\u2019s emotions, trying not to upset or anger them, adjusting your own behaviors to smooth things over and not cause future problems, not knowing whether you\u2019re right or wrong but acting as though you are wrong because it\u2019s easier to accommodate them: all are hallmarks of someone who has lost their internal compass because they\u2019re living in their partner\u2019s emotional landscape instead of their own. \n\nI\u2019ve been there and it\u2019s a really, really tough place, because you want them to be happy and you want to be happy but the only way you\u2019re happy is if they\u2019re happy and they\u2019re only happy if you don\u2019t upset them, and round and round you go. And it\u2019s not that you got there on your own because you and your partner have trained you to be the one that\u2019s responsible for his feelings - but the only way to get out of it is to reclaim ownership of your own feelings and self-knowledge. You have to relearn how to trust your instincts and stand up for yourself when he\u2019s being unreasonable. I don\u2019t know if your relationship overall is abusive, but this behavior absolutely is. He won\u2019t stop until you give him a reason to, because right now, he\u2019s getting all of his needs catered to while expecting you to neglect your own. You deserve to be happy regardless of how he feels, you deserve to have emotions that have nothing to do with him, and you deserve to center yourself in your own life. \n\nI really hope you consider addressing this with a therapist for your own sake, and if it\u2019s safe, with a couples\u2019 counselor because it can get better - but he has to recognize the harm he\u2019s caused and want to better for both of you.

So if someone complains because I often pull out the query about possible abuse, it's because I know about it.  Because I put up with it, didn't want to call it that, made excuses for him, took responsibility for his behavior, walked on eggshells, was in terror, and lost both my financial and physical and mental health because he was a raging abuser.

He's either highly emotionally manipulative or something is going on that he's distracted with that may be causing some depression and mood swings.

Doesn't matter.\n\nWhat matters is that at some point soon, you need to have a conversation about this incident, about how he acted, and why he was acting like such a child. He needs to tell you what he expected, how getaways and events could be better planned together. And you need to tell him how his tantrum ruined the night. It's good that we care about our partners happiness, but your anxiety is over the top for this minor disagreement. I would also ask him why he thought he needed to entertain his kids.
