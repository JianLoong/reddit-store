If yes, she\u2019d be ridiculous because it has zero impact on her. If no, then she is only mad because it happened to be her day off, prearranged as part of her work schedule. Why does it matter whether you were working or not?\n\nFrankly, the fact that you aren\u2019t taking off any time between jobs, it makes sense to screw off to some degree while you can.\n\nNow could you or should you have coached or informed things better/differently? Yes, probably, but that doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.", "NTA, \n\nYou're switching job and it sounds like you're burnt out. Maybe don't do it everyday but once in a while is fine. \n\nI used to take leave from work and tell my partner if I'd made plans for the day. There would always be some sort of \"Emergency\" or reason for me not being able to go unwind on a lake walk etc, despite me offering her the same opportunity for relaxation. \n\nI take three of my annual leave days a year for myself and don't tell anyone. Big shock, no \"emergencies\" or reasons to be home on those days. \n\nYou're going to get a lot of Y.T.A for this. It's a fine line and you're very much walking on the edge of it. Your partner is going to want you at home when you're not at work which is absolutely fine. It's also absolutely fine to want to enjoy a hobby now and again (Key words being now and again.)\n\nThe reason I'm giving you NTA is because I know from when my first was born my partner was mad at me for everything. For reference I was 21 and we were living at her mother's at the time. I worked 7:30am-5pm construction job with an hour of travel each way. I was out in the heat, the rain and the cold all day with two half hour breaks. When I got in from work I wanted a bath. I wasn't allowed because I'd \"Had it easy\" at work all day. So I had to wait for everybody else to have a bath first and they took their sweet time. Usually half 10 before I got in. She complained I put on weight so I started to play squash once a week (hour and a half max) she was not pleased about that in the slightest. Started going to the gym at 5am in the morning. \"You woke the baby up\" The following week \"You're putting on weight.\" She assumed any of my time not at work was her time off parent duty so my day would be, get up, go to work, come home, cook, clean, feed the baby, put the baby to bed while she sat on social media. \n\nWe eventually moved out, this continued for a year and we split up. Got back together during COVID. I took a job with shorter hours so I could be home more, the first thing she was concerned about was how much money I would be bringing in, not my sanity, not that I'd be home more. Could I still provide. And the answer to that was yes, the job paid more. We're now expecting our third and we found our balance along the way. That didn't happen until she started working the weekends. Not once was there anything for her to do when she came home from work, house was clean, kids were calming before bed and her evening meal was plated up for her. Few months of that and I finally got an apology. \n\nShe doesn't want to go anywhere without me during the week, and that's fine but now she understands on occasion I'd like to do a hobby or something for a couple of hours a week. However she still thinks every day of annual leave I take a year should be spent with her and the kids. So I take three in secret a year to recharge myself. For info these are usually things she has no interest in doing, lake or fell walking, bit of archery now and again. And as I said above, whenever I've taken days specifically for this and told my partner there's always been a reason why it's had to be cut short or not started at all.\n\nConclusion: I know this was really long winded but I hope you get the point. If you're out playing golf all day, go home and take the workload off your wife when you get home. It's you and your wife Vs the challenge, not you vs your wife. Find compromises and balance. \n\nBut you're not an asshole for playing golf for one day.", "Nothing but militant feminists here.
