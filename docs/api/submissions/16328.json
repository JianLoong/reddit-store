However, I really feel like instead of taking this as a \"welp I'm TA ok.\" Instead, use it as an actual true moment of self reflection and actually grow from this.  Learn to be a better father and a better partner.  Your wife has the full load of YOUR baby, plus household, plus holding down a full-time job... I promise you she probably works harder than you do. If there is unexpected downtime in a day, your wife deserves the break and help, at the very least.

You failed your wife on so many levels with your actions, please do better.", "Environmental concerns are first and foremost, mainly that the chemicals used to maintain the grass can have seriously deleterious effects downstream (I worked on a giant water quality case in South Carolina on this very topic). It's not \"pollution\" per se, it's that the chemicals that make grass grow well also make algae bloom, which throws off the balance of other ecosystems. There are also issues with water usage, which in some areas is a bigger concern than in others. But there's also the classist aspect, taking serviceable land and reserving it for the pleasure of the (usually) wealthy, which I why I carved out \"public courses\" in my post. I include in this 'classist' complaint the fact that so many 'deals' are struck while golfing amongst lawyers, business execs, and other so-called elites that bypass the official channels for these decisions and their often necessary oversights and regulations: the good-old-boys club, if you will.  The same lawyers on the SC case also often made decisions on other cases with judges and opposing counsel during golf outings, only to head into the courtroom and make it official, all without any official oversight or input from the actual parties involved. I suppose that's not golf's fault directly, but the 'special club' aspect of it is.\n\nDefenders will say that golf courses house wildlife, which is partially true, though I'd argue it's much less than a wild space, or even a public park, would have. They'll also say it's better than a mall or other types of \"bad\" development, which may be true... but that doesn't make them good, it just makes them less bad.", "The bar is below sea level.", "what's this \"we\" crap?
