For future reference, the way to handle this was \u201chey honey, there\u2019s not much left for me to do at work so I\u2019m going to take tomorrow off. I\u2019d like to go golfing from 9-12, and then I\u2019ll be home to take the baby and we can hang out together or you can go get some alone time.

You went golfing instead of going to work and neglected to tell your wife.", "YTA.  You did exactly what she accused you of doing.

Also:  YTA", "She doesn\u2019t get a day off. Of course she\u2019s angry. YTA. You said F it to work while she\u2019s taking a 7 month old and gets no extra time to sit with her thoughts.

After having done chores all day while I was entertaining the baby. I know exactly how your wife is feeling. You have no idea how much help you could have been.", "YTA.  It's not hard to communicate with your SO.  Especially with a 7 month old at home.  Your kids are babies once, go enjoy it.", "YTA. You blew off work to go golfing while your working wife stays at home with your infant.  Dafuq?  I'm guessing you don't do your share of child care in general.", "YTA. You went golfing instead of working or taking care of your family. You didn\u2019t tell your wife you just said \u201cf*ck it daddy needs a day on tee\u201d or whatever people like you say. I\u2019m sure your wife would like a random day off too but she\u2019s too busy raising your kids You really hit this one out of the park bud", "Would you be mad if the roles were reversed? If you were working 4 days a week and 1 day taking care of a 7 month old and your wife decided she was in \u201cf it mode\u201d and went shopping/golfing/day drinking/bowling/crafting/just sat in the park and twiddled her thumbs without telling you?", "YTA. And if you\u2019d just told her what you were doing it probably wouldn\u2019t have been that big of a deal. Like, just a message that morning like \u201cweathers nice and I don\u2019t have much to do. Thinking about popping out early for a round and then maybe we could do something special together later? Or I could take over for you at home if you\u2019d like.

Wait no she teaches dance not time to herself.  You screwed up. Golf won.

Do you even acknowledge that this kid is yours?!\n\nLook dude, you pointed out yourself that you didn't even mention the fact that you went golfing versus going to your job, but still thought she'd be happy for your hole in one. How clueless could you even be. You don't seem to care what your families needs are and make them out to be last on your list of importance. She was caring for your child which coming from another mom is it's own job without working ontop of it, and your moronic behind decided to do whatever you wanted instead. You played Hookey, you told on yourself after basically lying to her all day, and now your crying because your in the doghouse. Yeah, you screwed up.

How about you take care of your child instead of yourself.", "YTA \n\nIf you thought this was such a great idea, why did you feel the need to originally hide it from her???", "YTA. Your comments say her \"day off\" is...her going to another job. If you were going to blow off work, it would have been nice to offer to give HER a day off, or even ask her if it would be cool if you played a round or two and then take the kid off her hands for a few hours. She has two jobs and a baby, and you're ditching work to golf? C'mon, man.", "YTA. If you have to sneak off to have fun and leave her home with your kid, something is definitely fucked with your relationship", "YTA\n\nYour wife and child are more important. When is your scheduled time to be home with the baby? How much do you help her out? She's 24/7, I bet, between work and the baby, yet you can go golfing without thinking about what you need to be doing to help support your family and take care of your child. Especially going without even telling her is a total AH move. Be more present with your wife and child.", "Yea YTA.
