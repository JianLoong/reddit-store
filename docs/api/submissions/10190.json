We were just catching up and discussing our days. Valentine's Day was four days ago, and we spent the day together, where we gave each other gifts as she spent the night at mine. As part of her gifts, she gave me a set of chocolates as she knows I love my chocolates.\n\nSo, as we were talking on the phone call today, she asked me if I had eaten the chocolates she got me, which I said yes to. In a surprised tone, she asked if I ate all of them, and I jokingly replied yes (I didn't because if i ate all that chocolate in three days, I would probably get sick). She asked me again if I had finished them, and I chose to persist with the bit and said yes. She suddenly began crying as she was driving, which took me by surprise, to which I calmed her down and showed her that i was kidding and I showed her all the unopened chocolates.\n\nShe stopped crying, and I started laughing, saying, \"How can you cry that I ate the chocolates you got for me to eat?\" Though a little embarrassed, she then said I want you to remember me when you eat them, so you need to space out how you eat them. She went on to accuse me of playing with her feelings by joking around and making her cry. \n\nI dont know if she's right and I'm in the wrong or if she was being hypersensitive over nothing, AITA?\n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for your feedback. I just felt i needed to clarify a few things. By the time I started showing her the unopened chocolate boxes, she had reached home and parked in her car, so there was no danger with us being on video call then (initially I just told her I was kidding and helped her to calm down). She had also asked that I don't eat them all at once when she was giving them to me, which i agreed to because she likes it when we do silly romantic (at least to us) stuff. And Idk if this will make me sound bad, but she is on her period, which normally makes her behave a bit out of character, so maybe it explains why her behaviour may not make sense to some people.", "created_utc": 1676633494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114i7x5/aita_for_making_my_girlfriend_cry_because_of_a/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lol. \n\n~~So it's a gift with rules? And weird ones at that.~~ \n\n~~No, you're NTA for saying you ate them all, and continuing to say so. You broke your joke when you realized how upset she was (and that was good.)~~ \n\n~~It is extremely odd that she wants you to space out your eating them, so you can think about her longer? Idk lol. But, NTA.~~\n\nJust read your edit. You'd previously agreed to not eat them all when given to you, whether I understand or not, you both agreed (and called it romantic, so that's fine if that's your thing.) \n\nThat last line or two tho, oof. Blaming it on her period? You knew beforehand that she wanted you to spread out eating them, the post made me think she had *just* mentioned that. Making her sound extreme & strange. Now you say she's on her period, so maybe that's why she didn't take your \"joke\" well? \ud83d\ude44 **I'm changing my judgment to YTA.**", "Yta for writing the  most stupidest thing I've read today", "WTAF did I just read? \n\n1) your 25 yr old gf cried because she thought you ate chocolates she gave you for Valentine\u2019s Day and is dictating that you space them out.\n2) you \u201cpranked\u201d your girlfriend about eating all of the chocolates. Cool prank. \n3) you were video chatting while she was driving, hence being able to show her that you didn\u2019t eat the chocolates.\n\nESH", "NTA, she\u2019s being silly. She can\u2019t buy you chocolates and then not expect you to eat them. She can\u2019t dictate how you eat your chocolates\u2026 I\u2019d be confused if my boyfriend didn\u2019t eat any of the chocolates I got him.", "NTA,  and you cannot give a gift.  Then demand how the person who received the gift has to use it.\n\nThis is next level control by your GF", "Wtf? NTA but you're gf sounds unhinged. I bought my partner a massive bouquet of his favourite chocolate bars last year for V Day. If he ate all of them in one sitting I would have laughed at him. That's all.\n\nWhy in the hell would she impose rules on a gift and why would she cry? Makes 0 sense to me.", "You showed her the box while on a call when she was driving? Were you video calling while she was driving?\n\nESH though. Possibly for a video call while driving, but definitely for you making a stupid joke and persisting in it, and her for a reaction that sounds pretty wild about how someone eats their candy.", "NTA, she\u2019s being ridiculous. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate how you eat your chocolate.", "NTA, honestly if she didn't specify that's how she wanted you to view and consume them, that's on her.", "NTA\n\nI laughed a bit. My husband knows i collect small bottles of drinks from around the world. He brings these every time he comes back from a business trip.\n\nOnce he brought me a set of chocolate bottles filled with drinks (nothing i see around here).\n\nAnd he was curious why wasn't i eating any.\n\nI was tormented. I mean they were so beautiful and i was indeed curious about the taste of the drinks inside, but i couldn't replace them.\n\nFinally i started eating the doubles... I was willing to give some him and my kid but not to any guests...\n\nNext time he bought 2 sets and i ate 1 set one by one, during a long period of time... But i didn't touched the 2nd set.\n\nIt sat in my living room a long time and every day i kept saying \"i'll wait another day, then i'll open it\".\n\nGuess what? It expired (\n\nEdit to finish my comment\n\nIt expired (the chocolate, not the booze inside). Some bottles melted (\ud83d\ude05)... I had to throw them...\n\nWhy did i told you this?\n\nBecause i would keep some chocolate if it was gifted to me, but it's absurd to force someone to not eat it because \"I want you to think about me... long time\".\n\nEdit 2: i forgot to say: don't talk on your phones while driving, unless it's through Bluetooth! Much less video calls!!!\n\nYour gf needs to grow up!", "NTA.\n\nI don't get the joke, but that may just be me. But then I don't get her over the top reaction either. Why would you cry when somebody ate all the chocolate in three days. \n\nThe only reason I can think of why she cried, is because she hid something behind one of the chocolates and was upset you didn't call or text after finding it.", "I would say NTA, even after edit. It doesn't sound you think all women acting irrationally when they are on period or that period is only explanation of this kind of reaction. I personally am very crying prone in these days. Honestly I can imagine this scenario be okay joke while not on my period and making me cry hard while I am.", "NTA just hypersensitive or clingy.", "NTA\n\nI understand the sentiment, but I think your girlfriend is being overdramatic here.\n\nIf she wants you to think of her when you use a gift, it shouldn't be something you actually eat. I would never think of who gave me the gift when eating it.\n\nI love receiving sentimental gifts from my close friends and family. Those gifts never include chocolate because although I love chocolate, I don't consider it sentimental.", "NTA\n\nYou're 25, old enough to manage how much chocolate you eat in a day. It's weird that your gf thinks it's okay to dictate when and how much you can eat, you're not her child. \n\nThe joke was harmless and nothing to cry over, she's being very dramatic.", "You're NTA. Her reasoning sounds pretty immature for her age. But that aside, I'd be very concerned if someone gave me something edible then started obsessing about whether I had eaten it all yet. I'd start to wonder if there was something special in that box.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your edit shows you did agree to space out eating the chocolates but then that\u2019s all relative isn\u2019t it. Did she expect you to spend a year eating them or a week.

I can\u2019t image crying over someone eat the chocolates given to them as a Valentine's Day gift. Did she just expect you to eat them as slow as possible? Chocolates to go bad over time soooo. Your gf is overdramatic and she is overreacting", "Ummm WTF?  Is she 26 or 12?? Her behavior is so bizarre honestly. It\u2019s like a mixture of hypersensitivity and controlling AF! Why is she trying to dictate what you do with the gift of chocolate she got you? Did she include a note that says you can only eat one a day and must think of her when you do?? She also sounds insecure AF too. Idk about her. This whole interaction is just weird!", "NTA dude. \n\nYour gf brought you a gift which is meant to be eaten and it's a \"gift\" so you can do whatever you want with it.

In that context, I don't see how it was funny and therefore would say YTA.", "As someone who has a period, this whole post didn\u2019t make sense until that edit.\n\nShe cried to the point he had to calm her down??
