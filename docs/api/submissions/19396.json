I'm not saying they are messing around but really, she invites a guy she met without you there, basically on a date, unless you didnt add, \"gamble with us\", it looks like its just the two of them gambling.  Brother, that looks like a date to me.", "NTA. I agree with your perspective and honestly she would not like it if the roles were reversed.", "NTA. I can't imagine she'd be overly thrilled if the situation were reversed.", "NTA and your response should be, OK, fine, let me find a date for me and we can be a foursome.", "Yeah, not cool doing that on your anniversary trip in particular.", "NTA. What she did is inappropriate. She should have consulted you about it first.", "Kind of the asshole. Why shouldn't she invite him?

Not along the lines of inviting a guy to hang out and gamble, but rather because she didn\u2019t bother to include you.

Would you have a problem if her new friend was a woman? Is it just because you want a heads up regarding planning for activities?\n\nEdited to say NTA upon learning it\u2019s an anniversary trip.

If she had any ill-intent, she wouldn't have told you about it. But she told you about it right away, so it's not like she was trying to hide it from you. And you just said she invited him to the resort to gamble. You didn't say whether she was even going to be gambling with him or if she was, whether she assumed you would go too. \n\nIf he mentioned that he liked pizza, and she told him he should go to Pizza Palace because they make a really great pie, would you freak out?
