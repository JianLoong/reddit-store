I wasn't ecstatic about the idea, but I said she could if she stayed in his older brother's room (he's away at college). They immediately accepted this condition, which made me think this was a real situation, not a \"trick dad\" situation. About an hour ago I got a call from her mom, Crystal. Crystal wanted to know if her daughter was here.\n\nI said she was, and Crystal told me to send her home. I said she didn't want to go home, and I told her she could spend the night. Crystal said she didn't have a choice, and I said that she kind of does, because she's eighteen. Crystal said high school students are still considered minors even if they are eighteen (I don't think that's true) and that I needed to send her home. I said maybe a night apart would help them both cool down and could be a good thing. Crystal sounded really angry, and I sincerely think a night apart is probably what they need, because if I send the girl home she'll probably just argue with her mom more.\n\nCrystal called me a nosy prick and said I have no right to interfere with her parenting. She said she hoped all my kids decide to run off and never talk to me again. Then she hung up. I do think generally it's best not to get involved in someone else's parenting, but this girl is eighteen, and even if I kick her out, she might not go home. She might spend the night on the streets.
