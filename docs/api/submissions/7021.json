It's nothing fancy but we provide great food and excellent service I think.  I pay my servers a good wage and they work their buns off for their tips.  \n\nI started off as a dishwasher in this restaurant and worked my way up until I was able to buy it.  It took a lot of hard work and sacrifice.  I saved all my tips and worked a second and even a third job sometimes to save up.  My boss was great and she taught me how to take care of my staff so that they would take care of me.  \n\nThere is nothing I hate more than those fake bills people leave as tips.  Imagine working hard serving a family group and they leave you a $50 tip. And it turns out to be fake. I can still remember the first time it happened to me And I still hate the person who did it.  \n\nSo two Sundays ago one of my servers got stiffed again.  But this time the customer effed up.  They left a fake hundred but they miscalculated what they owed.  They shorted her $35 on the actual bill.  \n\nSo I called the cops on the non emergency number.  I knew which customer it was and I reported their license plate as well.  \n\nTwo hours later they were in the restaurant with the police.  They paid their bill in full and still didn't tip.  \n\nI told them to tell everyone from their little group that I was going to call the cops every time I saw one of these fake bills since, from now on, I will assume that they are trying to pass counterfeit money.  I also called their church and told their pastor the same thing.  \n\nThis last Sunday was great. No one from that church showed up.  We made about $300 less as a restaurant but my se vers each made more in tips since they weren't wasting their time on those people.  \n\nToday one of them came in at lunchtime and said that I was a bar person for embarrassing a member of their church for an honest mistake.  \n\nI said that carrying fake money around and getting people's hopes up isn't a nice thing to do either.  I said that if they couldn't afford to tip then they should eat at home or order takeout.  \n\nThey left a 10% tip.  But it left a bad taste in my mouth.  \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Keep supporting your staff and you\u2019ll be fine. Thank you!", "Tipping is what it is right now but NTA for reporting the customer.

I get that they\u2019re just leaving advertisements.", "NTA. There is a reason they make these things look like money. They know what they are doing.\nYou are within your rights to contact the police in the manner you did and I would have done the same. I would also treat it as counterfeit currency.\nHave you considered paying a living wage and including the tip in the cost of food?", "NTA\n\nI've worked the industry on many levels and understand that tips are a big part of the game. \n\nRespect for representing your employees.  \n\nI mean, I don't got to a church and leave fake bills in the greedy tray with messages telling them to go fuck themselves, so perhaps the same courtesy could be done?", "NTA I'm glad you stood up for your staff. I'm going to say those Bible pamphlets that resemble money should be classed as fraud and counterfeit money period ban it..if you try hand those out as a tip that person is the biggest AH. I'm not a server but I've actively seen people try do it to servers it pisses me off beyond belief seriously..I've even been thrown off myself at first glance it can often look like real money then the irritation sets in.  \n\nHow comes churches/religious groups are allowed to do that and not face repercussions in doing so? Yet average blue collar worker would go to jail if we even attempted to do the same thing repeatedly. It's counterfeit money period and should be treated as such and using the oh it's a Bible pamphlet reasoning is hogwash.

I also called their church and told their pastor the same thing>>, it is patently absurd and you sound like a fool. The purpose of counterfeiting is to pass off fake money as real. Therefore, counterfeiters tend not to try to pass pieces of paper that are half designed to look like a $100, and half blank save for a quote about how Jesus is the real treasure. Yeah. That works real well at the Apple store. \n\nFailing to tip may be obnoxious, but it is not a crime.
