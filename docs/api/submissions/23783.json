I was like exactly, I'm taking one of the most challenging paths a person can take in my career and I've never complained to my family about my sh#t. Not even a word because I chose it myself.\n\nShe told me I was a horrible sister and an even worse aunt, said she wanted nothing to do with an AH like me. Aita?\n\nEdit: I did have a conversation about it every time we had lunch in the past year. I started by saying let's keep all the negativity packed away for today.

Neither should be minimalized or marginalized for their challenges.", "NTA. She knew after one kid how much work it is and she still had 2 more. And of course, complaining about her miserable life is all she ever talks about... There's a time when people just have enough of listening to a broken record.

And it\u2019s ok to need it!", "NTA - She just needs a sounding board and used you as that. Parenting is hard. But she used the little time you had with each other to just dump it all on you.

However, as a parent, I understand her feelings. She also likely has nothing else to talk about. Kids suck all of your time, energy, and money. Three kids that age is all-encompassing. \nShe literally may have nothing else to share with you.", "NTA. Your sister is stressed out and taking it out on you. She's not entitled to your time or attention, especially if she's going to be rude to you.", "ESH\n\nPeople complain about the things happening in their life. You probably complain about things in life that are stressful. Your sister complains about her kids because they are stressful.

That's exhausting for the other party and worse when it's a topic they can't relate to or contribute to. Your sister does need some self awareness there. People like that are just rough to be around. It's also rude to the other party to just vent at them.\n\nYour problem, however, seems to be that you're tired of hearing the same rants over and over. You communicated poorly and minimized a sore point of your sister's. There's a way to say \"I don't want to have this same conversation everytime\" without attacking her.", "Are you sure you're not describing my sister? \n\nYou're NTA", "Yeah, it's hard to listen to the same complaints all the time. Ya just wanna say, get a life! Get some new interests cuz I can't listen to this anymore.\n\nYour sister, on the other hand, probably looks forward to these lunches because she feels comfortable venting to you. Maybe a compromise, 1/2 venting 1/2, anything other than the druge of motherhood. \n\nI gotta tell you, someone with 3 kids that age, she's a superhero just for getting dressed and leaving the house.", "NTA you ain't your sisters psych. I've chosen to have kids and don't complain about how hard it is I knew it wasn't going to he easy from the get go. Tell her to go complain to her mothers group.", "NTA but you could have been a little gentler in your delivery. But yeah, it's really draining to listen to someone complain nonstop. You can only take so much.", "OP, I think *both of you might be in the wrong here*.\n\nIt's completely normal for a mother of three to feel overwhelmed and tired, but if she's constantly dominating the conversation with complaints about her kids, she should consider going to therapy. It's not fair for her to use you as her dumping ground for negativity all the time. So, given that you were tired, your reaction was to be negative towards her.\n\nTo some extent, what you said it\u2019s true. If she thought she couldn't handle three kids without constantly complaining about it, maybe she should have had fewer children.\n\nHowever, even though you were tired, it was still a pretty harsh thing to say.\n\nHere's how you could approach the situation: talk to her and acknowledge that both of you went too far. Explain that during your dates, all she does is complain, and you feel like you're being treated as her therapist. Of course, you're part of her support system and will listen to her complaints, but does she ever listen to yours? Does she ask how you're doing, if anything good happened, or if you're facing any challenges? And even when it comes to her kids, can't she find something positive to say about them?\n\nSo, both of you might be at fault (ESH), but you can fix this by having an honest conversation and suggesting therapy for her to work on that negative spiral she often gets trapped in. This way, she can still vent her frustrations, but also work on finding more positive ways to cope. Moreover, your 'dates' can return to being what they used to be, you know, girl time where you both vent about your problems but also discuss the good things that are happening in your lives.", "ESH.  Based on OP's words there is at least a slight bit of truth in sister's accusation.  Sister was most likely just looking to vent a bit while out of the kids' earshot and got carried away.  I get OP's frustrations but they were not voiced in a productive manner and went from 0-100 in a moment.\n\nIt was, however, wrong of sister to monopolize the conversation.  Her response to OP was also harsh, but was responding in kind to OP.  Congrats on the career, but it doesn't make you a martyr anymore than being a parent to multiple children.\n\nSounds like you're both (understandably) stressed and in very different places in life right.  Give it some time.", "She's made her parenthood her whole personality. Good luck.", "ESH\n\nIts surprising that people with kids talk about their kids isn't it?\n\nRather than saying what you did, \"hey do you mind if we talk about something other than your kids for a bit\" Not \"Stop complaining, no one forced you to have them\" \n\nComplaining about something over and over is tedious I understand.", "Unpopular, but YTA. What adults typically do *before* lashing out is politely and kindly bring up an issue. Maybe she just doesn\u2019t realize how often she talks about the kids. \n\n\u201cHey can we change the subject, you speak about your kids a lot and I want to talk about other things as well.\u201d It\u2019s that easy. Bottling it up and then lashing out is childish. Her kids are the center of her world, and she\u2019s leaning on you for support. If you don\u2019t like how she\u2019s doing that, then fine, but lashing out is never the answer. You\u2019re 27. \n\nAlso, people complain about situations they put themselves in. It\u2019s very normal and very human to vent, even when it\u2019s an issue you caused yourself. I couldn\u2019t imagine trying to lean on you for support.", "ESH \n\nIt is exhausting to listen to someone complain, so your sister kind of sucks there. But you kinda suck too.

I share the hard part if anyone asks about it, I ask for advice if I need one, but I never complain for something that I chose to do. When people tell me why I don't complain I tell them exactly what you told your sister. It's called taking responsibility for one's decisions.", "NTA she was just looking for attention when you called her out on it she was just being a witch", "NTA. While you are right about having kids is your sister's choice, you could have handled it better. Just remember as you are cutting off your sister from her support system, dont pull a pikachu face when she does it to you in the future.", "NTA.  So many mothers love to throw themselves up on the cross.  But you are in residency for crissakes!  No comparison.  Hearing her complain must get so tiresome.  It is understandable that you reached a breaking point.", "NTA\n\nI mean, could you have handled it better? Sure. \n\nBut I have had this conversation with a couple friends. I get it, parenting is hard and all consuming. But relationships need to be more than one person complaining continually about a choice they made. \n\nFor a couple of friends we developed a 20 minute rule, vent about the kids for twenty minutes and then we move on. For one friend, they cut me out of their life because I wasn\u2019t going to listen to ranting every time we were together. It sucks but their choice is valid and so is mine. \n\nParenting does not grant absolution from being a good sister or friend. She needed to stop complaining and ask about you. She wants you to be there for her but isn\u2019t interested in reciprocating, that\u2019s unfair and selfish.", "\"An even worse aunt.\" Ah yes, how terrible of a person to not want to constantly talk shit about their nieces and / or nephews. NTA.", "Some people are just walking rain clouds. Best to just let them stew since they're just going to find ways to be negative anyhow. Unfortunately not much you can do, just do your best to avoid it, basically. Sucks that the only quality time with your sister is spoiled by her complaining the entire time. I'd say that sometimes people just need to vent about things and that's fine, but if it's a pattern then she needs to figure her stuff out. \n\nYou probably could have framed what you said a bit better or said it with more tact, but, we all get it. We've all been there. Good luck!\n\nNTA.", "YTA \n\n\nShe considered you part of her support system and you failed her. \n\n\nIf you're tired of the same conversation then learn to steer it in a different direction, or be an adult and say to her, \"do you mind if we talk about something else\"", "NTA. I\u2019m not saying you said the right thing, but you are in a residency and stressed out too and your sister dumped on you without considering your mental state first.", "YTA. Your sister looked to you as a safe space where she can talk about her feelings, where it wouldn\u2019t get back to her kids. Residency is hard, I get it. But the minute you decided to compare yourself to her, you became the AH. She has never been in residency, you\u2019ve never been a parent of multiple young kids. It\u2019s apples and oranges. \n\nAlso, being tired isn\u2019t an excuse. If you had a problem with your sister complaining, you should have brought it up more tactfully, but instead you invalidated her feelings to make yourself feel better.", "Yta. She was just venting you were mean.", "ESH as a SAHM my children are usually a topic for me, because it\u2019s a big chunk of my life. You are both in places in yours lives where things can get hard and exhausting. No parents do not own the right to be \u201cmore tired\u201d or stressed then non-parents, so I can understand the other perspective. Yes I chose to have my 2 children, in fact I went through hell just to have my family, it doesn\u2019t mean everything is all sunshine and roses. \n\nYou should have told her before you got angry how you were feeling, so that she was aware that she was monopolizing the conversation. I\u2019m ADHD, so I do this without even realizing it and now warn people that it\u2019s not intentional from the start and just to let me know if I am. My BFF and I are both the same, as in sometimes one of us just takes over the conversation and the other listens, but it\u2019s always reciprocal and we both laugh at ourselves when we do it, but never judge the other. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re pretty burnt out and maybe you should complain once in a while to let it out. Keeping it all in because it was your choice doesn\u2019t make you a better person, it means you\u2019re silencing the part of you that needs to be let out. When it finally does find a way out, it explodes because it was told to shut up for so long and has built up. Anger is your body\u2019s way of saying something isn\u2019t right, but is that your sisters fault that you\u2019re under stress? How about talk about it, complain as needed to vent and release that part of you wanting to come out.\n\nAs a parent I vent as a way to let of steam, to give a voice to those feelings, so I can let them go. I love my children with every ounce of my being, but that doesn\u2019t take away from just how hard it can be. I can only imagine the stress that you\u2019re under, because I\u2019ve never done it, but I can assume it\u2019s something that can be extremely overwhelming. It may have been your choice to go this direction in your career, but it doesn\u2019t take away just how hard it is. \n\nIt\u2019s called empathy and not dismissing another persons struggles. If anything, you don\u2019t seem to have great communication skills with each other. You both should try to understand the others perspective and find common ground. Getting angry at someone for always venting, but never telling them that you\u2019d like a break from it, makes you just as bad. No one is a mind reader, it\u2019s ridiculous to expect someone to just know how you\u2019re feeling.", "YTA\n\nYour sister seems to want to vent to you as her sibling. Just because you *choose* to have children doesn't mean it's suddenly easy or you love it 100% of the time.

I get it - listening to people who complain nonstop is exhausting. But she\u2019s allowed to have non-warm and fuzzy feelings about her kids sometimes. You\u2019re allowed to have feelings about your job. Just because you have chosen to keep any negative feelings to yourself doesn\u2019t mean everyone can, and people typically look to siblings as a safe place to vent.\n\nYou can tell her that you don\u2019t have the bandwidth to listen to complaining; that\u2019s fair.

We all make choices; it doesn\u2019t mean we always love every minute of them.", "Sounds exhausting to hear that every time when y\u2019all meet up. Not everyone wants to hear the same complaint every time. It was honestly her choice to get pregnant if that was her choice for all 3. I know some pregnancies are a surprise.", "ESH\n\nNo need to be so judgemental. \n\nYour sister sucks bc oc noone wants to listen to a rant about the other persons kids 100% of the time during the whole meet up. Especially if they don't have kids and can't relate. Its also a fact that if venting is the only form of communication you know when going out with friends/siblings, they will lose interest very fast, bc not a lot of ppl like to listen to monologues rather than having an actual conversation.\n\nYou suck for lashing out. The adult way of communicating would have been \"listen, sister, i noticed that every of our conversations when we meet up is you venting about your kids and parenthood and me listening. I understand everybody needs to vent from time to time, but i hope you understand that this gets rather boring for me over time. I would rather like to hear what else is going on in your life and tell you about mine and having an actual conversation with you.\"", "This is a tough one, because I think you are both going through very difficult, but very different, phases in your lives, which can make connections a challenge. But in the end, I would lean to YTA. You only see her a few times a year, and I assume the relationship is important to you. Sometimes being a friend or relative means putting up with their \"issues\"/\"challenges\"/etc even if it means putting yours on the backburner for a bit. Obviously, if this goes on too long, then there is an imbalance, but 3 kids with 1 under 2 is a lot to deal with, and probably will be for a while longer. \n\nIn addition, unless you have raised this squarely before - not tried to steer the conversation away from kids, but politely say you do not want to talk about kids anymore - then I think the reaction was OTT.", "ESH\n\nShe\u2019s venting to you, her sister, because she trust and loves you.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if it annoys you, and you can tell her that you don\u2019t want to hear about the kids. After all she doesn\u2019t have a right to vent to you if you don\u2019t want to hear it. \n\nI\u2019m sure you have some stressful shit going on that you vent to people about as well. No one forced you to do your residency, that was your choice. \n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are bad people you are just stressed out siblings.", "ESH I don\u2019t have kids but i agree it\u2019s fucking hard and our individualistic society makes it worse, there\u2019s hardly any support and the judgement from every corner is real and intense buuuuut your sis should be capable of being a multidimensional human being and discuss other topics. You can also choose to try and steer the convo away from kids or taken the time to explain to her nicely that you wanna talk about other stuff rather than snapping but i definitely get how boring it can be as the one with no kids trapped in the mommy zone convo", "NTA.\n\nYou could've *maybe* tried more gently nudging her to a different topic, but what I think most of the \"YTA\" people in these comments are missing is that maybe your sister is the type of person who gets super offended and would have overreacted to that. So maybe you knew you couldn't do that but one day enough was enough and you were tired so you snapped.\n\nParents are largely pretty narcissistic and I think I know what kind of \"mommy\" you're talking about.\n\n Lol I love when breeders tell the childless \"you just don't know what it's like.\" LOL!! YES WE DO!\n\nWe knew what it's like so much that we saw beyond and knew that once the IG and Facebook likes stop coming in and once the showers are over and once everyone is desensitized to how \"cute\" they are that it just becomes 1-2 people stuck 24/7 with the most helpless creatures on the planet for years and years.\n\nWhat will she base her personality on in 16-20 years when her kids are done school and move out?\n\nEdit: changed \"educated\" to \"done school.\"", "The interesting question is: What does/would she say if you ranted about the consequences of your career choices? High responsibility, not much sleep, constantly having to be up to the current developments etc. If she supports you, it's mutual, so Y T A. If she goes the way \"being a mom is harder than anything else\" it's N T A. First option is just ranting two siblings and letting of steam (where I suppose all the Y T A s are comming from). It's about letting the big persons' pants down for once. Second option is unilateral and not taking responsibility for her choices. Might be worth to clear that up and if it's option 1 even relieving for you.", "ESH. Your sister sounds exhausting even if you are exaggerating how much she complains about her kids. It\u2019s hard to be around someone that\u2019s that negative and I don\u2019t blame you for being tired of it. However, she\u2019s clearly stressed and it\u2019s natural for her to want to get that off her chest while she\u2019s away from her kids. You would not have been in the wrong if you had asked her if you could talk about something different because you didn\u2019t want to always focus on negative things while you\u2019re with her and wanted to just enjoy the limited time you guys had together. You are absolutely in the wrong for blowing up on your sister out of nowhere and yelling at her with no previous indication that you were upset about her complaining.\n\nNot only that, but you say you\u2019ve been going to lunch with her every few months for a few years and she always complains like that. If she doesn\u2019t get to complain about her kids since no one forced her to have children, by your own logic you don\u2019t get to complain about her topic of conversation at lunch since you chose to go to lunch with her and know she uses that time to complain. \n\nTo be real though, you need to get better coping skills. Clearly you\u2019re stressed too with your residency but if you actually don\u2019t complain about it like you claim, or even if you do sometimes but also tend to bottle most of that stress up, you\u2019re going to continue to get overwhelmed and have little things like that set you off and cause you to lash out and get all that bottled up frustration out. It\u2019s not healthy for you to hold all that in.", "ESH\n\nYea, she shouldn't be complaining all the time.  But, it's kind of what we parents do.  Complaining about the challenges and headaches of parenthood could be an Olympic sport.  Many of us understand it's annoying to those that don't have kids, and curb it.  We typically keep kidless friends at arms length though as a result.  If that's all she does, it's kind of assholish.\n\nYou're the asshole because this is her time to tell you about her life, and what's going on in it, and instead of listening, you berate her for it.  Her having three kids, all under 10, that's her life.  There's just not a whole lot more going on in her life.  That's just a reality of being a parent.  Yes, you being in your residency is tough, and exhausting.  I get it.  Your sister probably gets it and feels similarly about how you discuss it.  But that exhaustion doesn't excuse asshole behavior.\n\nBoth of you messed up here.  Both of you could use this as an opportunity to be better to each other going forward.", "YTA. You feel like you\u2019re better than your sister for picking a challenging career. Fine. But being a good sister includes being a support system.

Can hardly handle one kid, goes on to have 2 more.\n\nWhen you finish your training and get offered a well paying job, she will lash out even more.\n\nTime for her to grow up!", "NTA.

Rather than expressing your needs in a healthy way (\"Hey, I'm really burnt today, and while I want to be supportive, do you think we could change topics? I don't think I can offer you any advice on that right now\") you admit to lashing out. It's pretty common for people to do, but that didn't mean it's right.\n\nParenting can be isolating af, especially if she doesn't have a solid support system. Kids are biologically designed to be extremely selfish creatures, and caring for them day after day with no outlet can be incredibly taxing. We used to have more support through our social structure and necessity, and we are all having to adapt to how the world has changed. Should she be venting to you non-stop? Of course not. Set your boundaries, provide empathy where you can, but never more than you can handle. See if you can connect of shared interests that let's her embrace her identity as more than just a mom, maybe?\n\nLastly, your struggles and choices don't invalidate her experiences. Everyone is different, and has different thresholds for stress, productivity, caring, etc. If she is complaining like that, it's because something in her world is out of balance and she is trying to find a way to get by -- talk therapy helps for a reason, and having a connection and understanding can help get through a rough patch. Don't hold everyone to the same standards you've set for yourself. It sounds like you have an amazing capacity for accomplishing things, but there is a reason we are not all doctors.\n\nEdit:\nAlso, take a minute to check on her mental health. If she is really just complaining all of the time, and always negative and a downer, she may be fighting clinical depression.

Instead of sympathizing, steering the conversation away, or outright saying that she needs to tone down the venting a bit you went full asshole. Then you put yourself up on a pedestal \"behold, it is me! I have a hard job and I've not complained once!\" That's the most pathetic thing I've ever heard.\n\nYTA, you are a horrible sister and asshole.", "Sorry...people may not like this but I think 1/2 and1/2.

But even that's hard to say because things just happen sometimes *because* we are human.\n\nNTA Not for being annoyed, tired, or drained of listening to her, but because you should have communicated to her how you felt about it before saying what you did.\n\nMaybe something like, that while you love her kids, you would like to talk about other things. Since you don't see her often, you want to enjoy the time you *do* share with her in talking about her life outside of kids, your life, whatever you want to talk about, etc. Just giving an example.\n\nIn telling her that she shouldn't have this problem and that it was her choice, she probably felt invalidated. Because you essentially implied that there is no reason to complain because she decided to have kids. \"Consequences to her actions\" implies that her children are a burden. It sounds like her kids are her life. Her whole life right now. Especially if she were a stay at home mom (Correct me if I'm wrong). Even if she wasn't, when she gets home from work her  kids are her life. I'm very sure that she loves them very much, and saying that implies that deciding to have kids is a mistake. This could have triggered her. Her kids are not a mistake.\n\nSo I do think you could have been a little more compassionate in that she may not have anything else to talk about because this is her life. Telling you about her frustrations may her way of sharing with you. She may complain because she trusts you enough to share her feelings with her. You may also have been an outlet in which she could let out her frustrations. Being a mom can be isolating. **HOWEVER, AND WHATEVER THE REASON,** it's **TOTALLY** ok that/if you're **NOT** ok with that. These are conjectures but whatever the reasoning, there's always more that meets the eye in any situation is what I'm trying to say.\n\nI do understand your frustrations, and being a resident, I'm sure you have a lot of stress yourself, so **it's totally understandable that you reacted this way,** you're human.

My time and mental health is valuable\u2026I don\u2019t want to waste them as nothing more than an emotional punching bag doll.", "OP has spoken to her about it.  She didn't change anything.", "As if anything will be lost besides her shutting the f up and going home to her self-imposed misery.", "I\u2019ve encountered this attitude before and it makes me so angry. I get (having experienced it) that \u201cthere is no way out\u201d is part of the symptom pack, but the \u201cMY depression is UNIQUELY HARD unlike everyone ELSE\u2019S depression that can be helped by therapy\u201d line just\u2026uggghhh. I know someone who uses that and dumps his struggles on his partner, who DID actually seek help for her depression, but also wigs out if you suggest it\u2019s damaging to her for him to refuse help and keep wallowing. \n\nSorry, bit of a ramble. It\u2019s a sore spot.", "Ah yes. The misery company crowd. Very dramatic and draining.", "Every second born is a feral child.  The third tend to be super chill because they have no other choice \ud83e\udd23", "I think one of the challenges here is that all the kid stuff likely is your sisters adult issues. For a lot of parents, the reality is that the biggest and most stressful issues - the ones we want to share with our loved ones - are related to our day to day life. Which is related to our kids.\n\nI've had friends before that were total emotional vampires. Everything they said was negative, they were always the victim, and they never wanted to solve any problems - just moan. If that's your sister, I completely understand why you're frustrated.\n\nIf she's an emotional vampire, walk away. If she's just a tired parent with a lot of her plate, try helping her find new things to talk about. Go to the movies instead of getting lunch, or ask her what TV show she's been binging while she folds laundry. The kids are always going to be a part of her life and your conversations, but if you can cut her some slack and show her some empathy, she likely has other things going on too.\n\nAlso, vent about your residency. That's what family and friends are for.", "But why does the sister only complaint? She must be very miserable! My friends always update me with milestones on their kids and funny things they do! Once in awhile, they\u2019ll complain but it\u2019s mostly MIL issues. And we don\u2019t spend the whole time complaining about kids!!!!", "Epic hard truth moment that doesn't see the light of day anywhere else because it makes the normies mad.", "Nope I just have standards as to who is in my life.", "Noone is talking about feeling bad for someone, but as an exhausted parent you may need to vent about it.", "No one said anything about feeling bad for- but not being rude to your sister when she\u2019s venting or being kind instead may have been a better choice.", "Buddy if people aren't making time for you its not just that they have kids, maybe you just aren't all that likeable lmao."]}
