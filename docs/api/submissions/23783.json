And it\u2019s ok to need it!", "NTA - She just needs a sounding board and used you as that. Parenting is hard. But she used the little time you had with each other to just dump it all on you.

However, as a parent, I understand her feelings. She also likely has nothing else to talk about. Kids suck all of your time, energy, and money.

She's not entitled to your time or attention, especially if she's going to be rude to you.", "ESH\n\nPeople complain about the things happening in their life. You probably complain about things in life that are stressful. Your sister complains about her kids because they are stressful. It\u2019s literally what people do. \n\nTelling people they can\u2019t complain because they made their choice so therefore they lost the right to complain & it\u2019s gotta be all rainbows & butterflies is absurd.

That's exhausting for the other party and worse when it's a topic they can't relate to or contribute to. Your sister does need some self awareness there. People like that are just rough to be around. It's also rude to the other party to just vent at them.\n\nYour problem, however, seems to be that you're tired of hearing the same rants over and over. You communicated poorly and minimized a sore point of your sister's. There's a way to say \"I don't want to have this same conversation everytime\" without attacking her.", "Are you sure you're not describing my sister? \n\nYou're NTA", "Yeah, it's hard to listen to the same complaints all the time. Ya just wanna say, get a life! Get some new interests cuz I can't listen to this anymore.\n\nYour sister, on the other hand, probably looks forward to these lunches because she feels comfortable venting to you. Maybe a compromise, 1/2 venting 1/2, anything other than the druge of motherhood. \n\nI gotta tell you, someone with 3 kids that age, she's a superhero just for getting dressed and leaving the house.", "NTA you ain't your sisters psych. I've chosen to have kids and don't complain about how hard it is I knew it wasn't going to he easy from the get go. Tell her to go complain to her mothers group.", "NTA but you could have been a little gentler in your delivery. But yeah, it's really draining to listen to someone complain nonstop. You can only take so much.", "OP, I think *both of you might be in the wrong here*.\n\nIt's completely normal for a mother of three to feel overwhelmed and tired, but if she's constantly dominating the conversation with complaints about her kids, she should consider going to therapy. It's not fair for her to use you as her dumping ground for negativity all the time. So, given that you were tired, your reaction was to be negative towards her.\n\nTo some extent, what you said it\u2019s true. If she thought she couldn't handle three kids without constantly complaining about it, maybe she should have had fewer children.\n\nHowever, even though you were tired, it was still a pretty harsh thing to say.\n\nHere's how you could approach the situation: talk to her and acknowledge that both of you went too far. Explain that during your dates, all she does is complain, and you feel like you're being treated as her therapist. Of course, you're part of her support system and will listen to her complaints, but does she ever listen to yours? Does she ask how you're doing, if anything good happened, or if you're facing any challenges? And even when it comes to her kids, can't she find something positive to say about them?\n\nSo, both of you might be at fault (ESH), but you can fix this by having an honest conversation and suggesting therapy for her to work on that negative spiral she often gets trapped in. This way, she can still vent her frustrations, but also work on finding more positive ways to cope. Moreover, your 'dates' can return to being what they used to be, you know, girl time where you both vent about your problems but also discuss the good things that are happening in your lives.", "ESH.  Based on OP's words there is at least a slight bit of truth in sister's accusation.  Sister was most likely just looking to vent a bit while out of the kids' earshot and got carried away.  I get OP's frustrations but they were not voiced in a productive manner and went from 0-100 in a moment.\n\nIt was, however, wrong of sister to monopolize the conversation.  Her response to OP was also harsh, but was responding in kind to OP.  Congrats on the career, but it doesn't make you a martyr anymore than being a parent to multiple children.\n\nSounds like you're both (understandably) stressed and in very different places in life right.  Give it some time.", "She's made her parenthood her whole personality. Good luck.", "ESH\n\nIts surprising that people with kids talk about their kids isn't it?\n\nRather than saying what you did, \"hey do you mind if we talk about something other than your kids for a bit\" Not \"Stop complaining, no one forced you to have them\" \n\nComplaining about something over and over is tedious I understand.", "Unpopular, but YTA. What adults typically do *before* lashing out is politely and kindly bring up an issue. Maybe she just doesn\u2019t realize how often she talks about the kids. \n\n\u201cHey can we change the subject, you speak about your kids a lot and I want to talk about other things as well.\u201d It\u2019s that easy. Bottling it up and then lashing out is childish. Her kids are the center of her world, and she\u2019s leaning on you for support. If you don\u2019t like how she\u2019s doing that, then fine, but lashing out is never the answer. You\u2019re 27. \n\nAlso, people complain about situations they put themselves in. It\u2019s very normal and very human to vent, even when it\u2019s an issue you caused yourself.

I share the hard part if anyone asks about it, I ask for advice if I need one, but I never complain for something that I chose to do.

It's called taking responsibility for one's decisions.", "NTA she was just looking for attention when you called her out on it she was just being a witch", "NTA. While you are right about having kids is your sister's choice, you could have handled it better. Just remember as you are cutting off your sister from her support system, dont pull a pikachu face when she does it to you in the future.", "NTA.  So many mothers love to throw themselves up on the cross.  But you are in residency for crissakes!  No comparison.  Hearing her complain must get so tiresome.  It is understandable that you reached a breaking point.", "NTA\n\nI mean, could you have handled it better? Sure. \n\nBut I have had this conversation with a couple friends. I get it, parenting is hard and all consuming. But relationships need to be more than one person complaining continually about a choice they made. \n\nFor a couple of friends we developed a 20 minute rule, vent about the kids for twenty minutes and then we move on. For one friend, they cut me out of their life because I wasn\u2019t going to listen to ranting every time we were together. It sucks but their choice is valid and so is mine. \n\nParenting does not grant absolution from being a good sister or friend. She needed to stop complaining and ask about you. She wants you to be there for her but isn\u2019t interested in reciprocating, that\u2019s unfair and selfish.", "\"An even worse aunt.\" Ah yes, how terrible of a person to not want to constantly talk shit about their nieces and / or nephews. NTA.", "Some people are just walking rain clouds. Best to just let them stew since they're just going to find ways to be negative anyhow. Unfortunately not much you can do, just do your best to avoid it, basically. Sucks that the only quality time with your sister is spoiled by her complaining the entire time. I'd say that sometimes people just need to vent about things and that's fine, but if it's a pattern then she needs to figure her stuff out. \n\nYou probably could have framed what you said a bit better or said it with more tact, but, we all get it. We've all been there. Good luck!\n\nNTA.", "YTA \n\n\nShe considered you part of her support system and you failed her. \n\n\nIf you're tired of the same conversation then learn to steer it in a different direction, or be an adult and say to her, \"do you mind if we talk about something else\"", "NTA. I\u2019m not saying you said the right thing, but you are in a residency and stressed out too and your sister dumped on you without considering your mental state first.", "YTA. Your sister looked to you as a safe space where she can talk about her feelings, where it wouldn\u2019t get back to her kids. Residency is hard, I get it. But the minute you decided to compare yourself to her, you became the AH. She has never been in residency, you\u2019ve never been a parent of multiple young kids. It\u2019s apples and oranges. \n\nAlso, being tired isn\u2019t an excuse. If you had a problem with your sister complaining, you should have brought it up more tactfully, but instead you invalidated her feelings to make yourself feel better.", "Yta. She was just venting you were mean.", "ESH as a SAHM my children are usually a topic for me, because it\u2019s a big chunk of my life. You are both in places in yours lives where things can get hard and exhausting. No parents do not own the right to be \u201cmore tired\u201d or stressed then non-parents, so I can understand the other perspective. Yes I chose to have my 2 children, in fact I went through hell just to have my family, it doesn\u2019t mean everything is all sunshine and roses. \n\nYou should have told her before you got angry how you were feeling, so that she was aware that she was monopolizing the conversation. I\u2019m ADHD, so I do this without even realizing it and now warn people that it\u2019s not intentional from the start and just to let me know if I am. My BFF and I are both the same, as in sometimes one of us just takes over the conversation and the other listens, but it\u2019s always reciprocal and we both laugh at ourselves when we do it, but never judge the other. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re pretty burnt out and maybe you should complain once in a while to let it out. Keeping it all in because it was your choice doesn\u2019t make you a better person, it means you\u2019re silencing the part of you that needs to be let out. When it finally does find a way out, it explodes because it was told to shut up for so long and has built up. Anger is your body\u2019s way of saying something isn\u2019t right, but is that your sisters fault that you\u2019re under stress? How about talk about it, complain as needed to vent and release that part of you wanting to come out.\n\nAs a parent I vent as a way to let of steam, to give a voice to those feelings, so I can let them go. I love my children with every ounce of my being, but that doesn\u2019t take away from just how hard it can be. I can only imagine the stress that you\u2019re under, because I\u2019ve never done it, but I can assume it\u2019s something that can be extremely overwhelming. It may have been your choice to go this direction in your career, but it doesn\u2019t take away just how hard it is. \n\nIt\u2019s called empathy and not dismissing another persons struggles. If anything, you don\u2019t seem to have great communication skills with each other. You both should try to understand the others perspective and find common ground. Getting angry at someone for always venting, but never telling them that you\u2019d like a break from it, makes you just as bad. No one is a mind reader, it\u2019s ridiculous to expect someone to just know how you\u2019re feeling.", "YTA\n\nYour sister seems to want to vent to you as her sibling. Just because you *choose* to have children doesn't mean it's suddenly easy or you love it 100% of the time.

I get it - listening to people who complain nonstop is exhausting. But she\u2019s allowed to have non-warm and fuzzy feelings about her kids sometimes. You\u2019re allowed to have feelings about your job. Just because you have chosen to keep any negative feelings to yourself doesn\u2019t mean everyone can, and people typically look to siblings as a safe place to vent.\n\nYou can tell her that you don\u2019t have the bandwidth to listen to complaining; that\u2019s fair. But to vilify her for having her any kind of negative feelings about her life is not fair and very rude. We all make choices; it doesn\u2019t mean we always love every minute of them.", "Sounds exhausting to hear that every time when y\u2019all meet up. Not everyone wants to hear the same complaint every time. It was honestly her choice to get pregnant if that was her choice for all 3. I know some pregnancies are a surprise.", "ESH\n\nNo need to be so judgemental. \n\nYour sister sucks bc oc noone wants to listen to a rant about the other persons kids 100% of the time during the whole meet up. Especially if they don't have kids and can't relate. Its also a fact that if venting is the only form of communication you know when going out with friends/siblings, they will lose interest very fast, bc not a lot of ppl like to listen to monologues rather than having an actual conversation.\n\nYou suck for lashing out. The adult way of communicating would have been \"listen, sister, i noticed that every of our conversations when we meet up is you venting about your kids and parenthood and me listening. I understand everybody needs to vent from time to time, but i hope you understand that this gets rather boring for me over time. I would rather like to hear what else is going on in your life and tell you about mine and having an actual conversation with you.\"", "This is a tough one, because I think you are both going through very difficult, but very different, phases in your lives, which can make connections a challenge. But in the end, I would lean to YTA. You only see her a few times a year, and I assume the relationship is important to you. Sometimes being a friend or relative means putting up with their \"issues\"/\"challenges\"/etc even if it means putting yours on the backburner for a bit. Obviously, if this goes on too long, then there is an imbalance, but 3 kids with 1 under 2 is a lot to deal with, and probably will be for a while longer. \n\nIn addition, unless you have raised this squarely before - not tried to steer the conversation away from kids, but politely say you do not want to talk about kids anymore - then I think the reaction was OTT.", "ESH\n\nShe\u2019s venting to you, her sister, because she trust and loves you.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if it annoys you, and you can tell her that you don\u2019t want to hear about the kids. After all she doesn\u2019t have a right to vent to you if you don\u2019t want to hear it. \n\nI\u2019m sure you have some stressful shit going on that you vent to people about as well. No one forced you to do your residency, that was your choice. \n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are bad people you are just stressed out siblings.", "ESH I don\u2019t have kids but i agree it\u2019s fucking hard and our individualistic society makes it worse, there\u2019s hardly any support and the judgement from every corner is real and intense buuuuut your sis should be capable of being a multidimensional human being and discuss other topics. You can also choose to try and steer the convo away from kids or taken the time to explain to her nicely that you wanna talk about other stuff rather than snapping but i definitely get how boring it can be as the one with no kids trapped in the mommy zone convo", "NTA.\n\nYou could've *maybe* tried more gently nudging her to a different topic, but what I think most of the \"YTA\" people in these comments are missing is that maybe your sister is the type of person who gets super offended and would have overreacted to that. So maybe you knew you couldn't do that but one day enough was enough and you were tired so you snapped.\n\nParents are largely pretty narcissistic and I think I know what kind of \"mommy\" you're talking about.\n\n Lol I love when breeders tell the childless \"you just don't know what it's like.\" LOL!! YES WE DO!\n\nWe knew what it's like so much that we saw beyond and knew that once the IG and Facebook likes stop coming in and once the showers are over and once everyone is desensitized to how \"cute\" they are that it just becomes 1-2 people stuck 24/7 with the most helpless creatures on the planet for years and years.\n\nWhat will she base her personality on in 16-20 years when her kids are done school and move out?\n\nEdit: changed \"educated\" to \"done school.\"", "The interesting question is: What does/would she say if you ranted about the consequences of your career choices? High responsibility, not much sleep, constantly having to be up to the current developments etc. If she supports you, it's mutual, so Y T A. If she goes the way \"being a mom is harder than anything else\" it's N T A. First option is just ranting two siblings and letting of steam (where I suppose all the Y T A s are comming from). It's about letting the big persons' pants down for once. Second option is unilateral and not taking responsibility for her choices. Might be worth to clear that up and if it's option 1 even relieving for you.", "ESH. Your sister sounds exhausting even if you are exaggerating how much she complains about her kids. It\u2019s hard to be around someone that\u2019s that negative and I don\u2019t blame you for being tired of it. However, she\u2019s clearly stressed and it\u2019s natural for her to want to get that off her chest while she\u2019s away from her kids. You would not have been in the wrong if you had asked her if you could talk about something different because you didn\u2019t want to always focus on negative things while you\u2019re with her and wanted to just enjoy the limited time you guys had together. You are absolutely in the wrong for blowing up on your sister out of nowhere and yelling at her with no previous indication that you were upset about her complaining.\n\nNot only that, but you say you\u2019ve been going to lunch with her every few months for a few years and she always complains like that. If she doesn\u2019t get to complain about her kids since no one forced her to have children, by your own logic you don\u2019t get to complain about her topic of conversation at lunch since you chose to go to lunch with her and know she uses that time to complain. \n\nTo be real though, you need to get better coping skills. Clearly you\u2019re stressed too with your residency but if you actually don\u2019t complain about it like you claim, or even if you do sometimes but also tend to bottle most of that stress up, you\u2019re going to continue to get overwhelmed and have little things like that set you off and cause you to lash out and get all that bottled up frustration out. It\u2019s not healthy for you to hold all that in.", "ESH\n\nYea, she shouldn't be complaining all the time.  But, it's kind of what we parents do.  Complaining about the challenges and headaches of parenthood could be an Olympic sport.  Many of us understand it's annoying to those that don't have kids, and curb it.  We typically keep kidless friends at arms length though as a result.  If that's all she does, it's kind of assholish.\n\nYou're the asshole because this is her time to tell you about her life, and what's going on in it, and instead of listening, you berate her for it.  Her having three kids, all under 10, that's her life.  There's just not a whole lot more going on in her life.  That's just a reality of being a parent.  Yes, you being in your residency is tough, and exhausting.  I get it.  Your sister probably gets it and feels similarly about how you discuss it.  But that exhaustion doesn't excuse asshole behavior.\n\nBoth of you messed up here.  Both of you could use this as an opportunity to be better to each other going forward.", "YTA. You feel like you\u2019re better than your sister for picking a challenging career. Fine. But being a good sister includes being a support system.

Just because she wanted to have kids doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t allowed to complain and vent and lean on her support system.

One of the kindest things one can do is make space where they are your sibling and friend not A Parent. Communicating that compassionately and pressing them to keep that space can be hard.
