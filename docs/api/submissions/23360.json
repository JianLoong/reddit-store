NTA", "Yeah my brother is totally a bad dad both for his temper and his leaving his kids in my mom's care.", "I agree with you. I haven't called CPS because I'm afraid of my nephews going into the foster system and experiencing the kinds of things I experienced in foster care. I truly don't know which option is worse, my mother, or foster care.", "Nonsense. Sending your children to a woman known to have abused children in the past, and ignoring their injuries, DOES make you a bad mother. There is no sugar coating it.", "\n\n>You are an asshole for implying your sister in law is a bad mother\n\nshe didn't imply, she stated it plainly, and it is a fact. sil and brother *are* bad parents.", "Honestly, I don't know what country you're in, but in the UK it would absolutely be an issue with social services. You should consider contacting them if Judy is genuinely a child abuser.", "CPS shouldn\u2019t take the kids away unless you bro refuses to find alternative child care. It\u2019s not like him and SIL are actively hurting them. If the children aren\u2019t in imminent danger they will be given the opportunity to rectify the situation. I called CPS on a family once (their home was horrific. Roaches crawled on the baby who was delayed in walking bc she couldn\u2019t leave the pack n play bc the animals pooped and peed everywhere and the parents did NOT clean it up. The fridge was filled with molded/rotten food and roaches. It was just horrific.) Even with that they were given a week to clean, get rid of the aggressive dog, par the pets down from 8 to 3 (city law limits), provide proof the roaches were treated, get a new working stove, and a few other things. They managed to pull it off and not have the kids removed.", "Thats a good point, I guess I'm just gunshy about it because of my experience. I've been thinking on it, and I think I'm going to call child services. My mother being responsible for those boys has never sat well with me, plus their house is gross. They use the bathtub as a litter box for their cats and bathe at my moms house, and their fridge is always full of moldy or spoiled food. I caught my nephew eating moldy bread once.", "As much as I HATE to say wait 2-3 weeks\u2026wait. If CPS shows up tomorrow your SIL would have known it was you. This will keep the peace. Or she may think the other family member did it.", "I would call CPS now, SIL is going to blame OP or May regardless. And the fact that the kids were eating moldy food and can\u2019t even shower/bathe in their home because they use it as a freaking litter box is absolutely a reason to call CPS especially when you add in the fact that their primary baby sitter had their own kids removed by CPS due to abuse. If OP waits then that gives SIL time to try and clean and present a false reality to CPS when they come to make the home visit.", "Valid point.", "been in your shoes and what you have to ask yourself is if being the \u2018bad guy\u2019 in the eyes of you family is better than looking out for the well being if two kids who can\u2019t speak for themselves. in this case I would say BE THE BAD GUY. you know your nephews are being abused, speak out because until you do, no one else will. Do not be part of the abuse wheel. Break it.", "NTA. Wow. I hope you have a chance to set the record straight is CPS does contact your aunt."]}
