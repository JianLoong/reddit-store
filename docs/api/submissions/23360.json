NTA", "Yeah my brother is totally a bad dad both for his temper and his leaving his kids in my mom's care.", "I agree with you. I haven't called CPS because I'm afraid of my nephews going into the foster system and experiencing the kinds of things I experienced in foster care. I truly don't know which option is worse, my mother, or foster care.", "Nonsense. Sending your children to a woman known to have abused children in the past, and ignoring their injuries, DOES make you a bad mother. There is no sugar coating it.", "\n\n>You are an asshole for implying your sister in law is a bad mother\n\nshe didn't imply, she stated it plainly, and it is a fact. sil and brother *are* bad parents.", "Honestly, I don't know what country you're in, but in the UK it would absolutely be an issue with social services. You should consider contacting them if Judy is genuinely a child abuser.", "CPS shouldn\u2019t take the kids away unless you bro refuses to find alternative child care. It\u2019s not like him and SIL are actively hurting them. If the children aren\u2019t in imminent danger they will be given the opportunity to rectify the situation. I called CPS on a family once (their home was horrific. Roaches crawled on the baby who was delayed in walking bc she couldn\u2019t leave the pack n play bc the animals pooped and peed everywhere and the parents did NOT clean it up. The fridge was filled with molded/rotten food and roaches. It was just horrific.) Even with that they were given a week to clean, get rid of the aggressive dog, par the pets down from 8 to 3 (city law limits), provide proof the roaches were treated, get a new working stove, and a few other things. They managed to pull it off and not have the kids removed.", "Thats a good point, I guess I'm just gunshy about it because of my experience. I've been thinking on it, and I think I'm going to call child services. My mother being responsible for those boys has never sat well with me, plus their house is gross. They use the bathtub as a litter box for their cats and bathe at my moms house, and their fridge is always full of moldy or spoiled food. I caught my nephew eating moldy bread once.", "As much as I HATE to say wait 2-3 weeks\u2026wait. If CPS shows up tomorrow your SIL would have known it was you. This will keep the peace. Or she may think the other family member did it.", "I would call CPS now, SIL is going to blame OP or May regardless. And the fact that the kids were eating moldy food and can\u2019t even shower/bathe in their home because they use it as a freaking litter box is absolutely a reason to call CPS especially when you add in the fact that their primary baby sitter had their own kids removed by CPS due to abuse. If OP waits then that gives SIL time to try and clean and present a false reality to CPS when they come to make the home visit.", "Valid point.", "been in your shoes and what you have to ask yourself is if being the \u2018bad guy\u2019 in the eyes of you family is better than looking out for the well being if two kids who can\u2019t speak for themselves. in this case I would say BE THE BAD GUY. you know your nephews are being abused, speak out because until you do, no one else will. Do not be part of the abuse wheel. Break it.", "NTA. Wow. I hope you have a chance to set the record straight is CPS does contact your aunt.", "NTA If you were taken away by the state, you should call DFCS. She probably hasn't been cleared to be with children. You have a lot of reasons to be concerned.", "NTA and I don't even know what else to say.", "NTA, and it seems as if your brother has continued the cycle of abuse that is very common with people who were abused as children.  I'd also bet that Kate was abused or neglected.  You should definitely report them & your mother - living in a filthy home (cat litter in the bathtub is absolutely disgusting!) is definitely against all healthy living requirements.  Those poor boys deserve better.\n\nI really hope things turn out well for your aunt, I know how awful it is to have CPS called on you.  It happened to me when my son was in Cub Scouts & had a meltdown.  He was literally attacking me, kicking & biting, and I was reported for wrapping him in a bear hug & making him sit down!  The CPS worker was absolutely astounded that they had been called, especially when my son butted into the questioning saying \"I attacked my mom & she just stopped me\"!", "I'm guessing the US because 'CPS' stands for Child Protective Services and I *think* is a US specific term.\n\nAnd yes, CPS would be interested in someone who lost parental rights of their children for abuse acting as a babysitter. Depending on whether there was a criminal case, she might be violating a court order, too.", "I will never understand this as a parent ur job is to protect ur kids educate them and help them grow into happy healthy functioning adults leaving them with someone who had their kids removed by Cps and is a known abuser.. o don\u2019t understand", "kate is right. 6 kids IS too many. the older ones get parentified. and kate is bad for leaving her kids w an abuser. ESH", "Wow. SIL is a major AH for calling CPS on May for no real reason. CPS has to now open an investigation into May\u2019s family, traumatizing the children. I\u2019m so mad at SIL right now!!! This will be a months long nightmare for May\u2019s family. Make sure May knows that it was SIL who called CPS.", "op=NTA \n\nJudy's children were taken away.  Yeah but she and KATE who allows Judy to care for her kids feel they can/should Judge May who has 6 kids.  Not their d\\*mn business and if Kate really has called CPS on May, I hope it bites her in the arse.  \n\nCPS cannot stop May from, reproducing.  They can only continue to remove children from the home for Neglect--if they are actually declared neglected by CPS.\n\nPS For your LOVE of May, contact CPS and proactively support her(or if you feel that is too soon) at least do it once May is confronted by CPS over Kate's accusations--also make it known to May that Kate has said in your presence that she HAS called CPS on May.  \n\nIf they haven't contacted May yet, she can make sure she's spit/spot for any inspections(offer to help clean/organize, make sure pantry is full and house is safe for children/babies whatever she has).", "I called May and told her as soon as I got to my car. I could not believe my SIL would stoop so low.", "Good for you. Though don't expect your brother, his wife or your mother to approve.", "Its not. Its also used in Australia in one state", "ESH You know you should call CPS.  All adults are at fault here.", "Good to know, thank you!"]}
