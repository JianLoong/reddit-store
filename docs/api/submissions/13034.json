It's sweet that your husband worked out a nighttime routine with your daughter that worked for them at the time.\n\nBut kids do grow and change. Rapidly at that age. And quite frankly, the nighttime routine that he had in place was...excessive. \n\nYou haven't stolen anything from him. He can still read your daughter books and take her on car rides. He can warm a blanket for her whenever she wants one. As she ages, he can even introduce new elements into her nightly routine if he wants. \n\nIt's reasonable for him to grieve that this time in his life, which clearly he cherished, is passed. \n\nIt's unreasonable for him to attack you for simplying his elaborate rituals.", "NTA but whoa, you've got parenting issues on your hands.  Mark's methods are extreme and going to lead to real problems (like if you need a babysitter or something) but his attitude is even worse. He wouldn't compromise on what is obviously way too much bedtime routine, he thinks not performing a three ring circus every night is forcing her to grow up too fast, he won't work with you to find a reasonable alternative, and he's obviously getting too much satisfaction on your daughter being completely dependent even in sleep.\n\nFurthermore, his method in no way promotes healthy sleep habits. An 18 month old shouldn't need a car ride and a rock in a stroller. She *should* be able to put herself to sleep alone. Bed time routines are healthy but they should be manageable.  Stories, a cuddle and tuck in, say goodnight to the animals all at once, for example. He is creating a monster. Stick to your guns and suggest a parenting sleep coach (they're out there and do phone consults) so he can hear from an \"expert\" what healthy boundaries are!", "NTA, the previous bedtime routine seems to have been more about Mark's daddy-daughter time than your daughter's needs.", "NTA. What he was doing was unhealthy and allowed Nova to set excessive expectations on the two of you. Kids that age should be going to bed with little difficulty, and this routine was holding back her development toward becoming independent and understanding boundaries. It sounds like you kept at least one book in the routine, and that should be more than enough bedtime quality time. He can bond with her more when it's NOT bedtime.", "NTA\n\nHe was holding her back, and for what? The memories? \n\nYour job is to raise a fully functioning human being. Forcing them into a lengthy, unnecessary routine doesn't set her up for success in the future.\n\nAnd he showed that he wasn't doing it for HER, he was doing it for HIM. He's being selfish in a way that is detrimental to your child.", "NTA that routine was unsustainable. What happens when someone else minds her? A simpler routine is much more beneficial for all of you.", "NTA - That needed to be stopped so she can start developing appropriate bedtime and sleep habits.", "NTA, that\u2019s a lot and it\u2019s not very environmentally or economically friendly to be driving that much.", "Definitely NTA!\n\nOkay this is speaking as an Autistic person who relies on routine to self regulate, and also has multiple Autistic children with their own bedtime routines. That bedtime routine was nuts! \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but that sounds like it takes over an hour? \n\nYeah, you absolutely needed to cut that down majorly. I understand that kids get used to their routines, but for your husband to expect you to maintain that is ridiculous! Honestly I can't believe he's been doing that all this time, or that he's angry that you simplified it!", "NTA. Great job helping to smooth her maturing and bedtime. The more independent a toddler is for bedtime, the less stressed bedtime makes them. Your husband will adjust (he's just missing the extended bonding ritual).", "NTA. Your husband wasn't doing that routine for her benefit, or even because he thought it was required, but for his own. That's not fair to you, and it's frankly unhealthy for her. If that had stretched out, she'd become a toddler, preschooler, and then elementary-aged child with extreme sleep-related needs and limitations. \n\nI'm sad for you that he put up such a fight, tried to make you feel you aren't 'allowed' to have a say, and then went on to treat you badly after you did make positive changes. That speaks poorly of the dynamic in your relationship. Maybe for that reason - as well as for the difficulty that Mark is having with the parenting changes that come with a growing child - you should seek therapy.", "NTA. He knows you can read books and cuddle and hang out all day right?", "NTA that is WAY too much for parent *and* child.", "NTA, that's nuts.  You guys need to have a bigger conversation about parenting styles though, this isn't going to be the last issue.", "NAH. I'm saying this because I'm resistant to point the finger at Mark. He has every right to be sad over the loss of time, I get that totally. BUT...and this is a big one...that nighttime routine he was doing wasn't healthy. There was no opportunity for Nova to learn to self-soothe and fall asleep on her own. Right now, it seems like you took something away but in the end, you have taught her how to help herself fall asleep.\n\nI think we all mourn the loss when our babies start growing up. It's a part of parenthood most of us were not prepared for but it is inevitable. Help him to understand how he can treasure *other* moments with her and how it adds value to your life as a couple because you can put her to bed more quickly and spend quality time together.", "NTA but it would be nice to find some other daddy-daughter bonding for them to do. A good bedtime routine is important, but he clearly wants more time with her, which is wholesome. Something special just for the two of them would probably make Mark feel better.", "YTA for making up this bullshit story and posting it to reddit.", "Awwww. Your husband\u2019s reaction pulled on my heartstrings. \n\nYou are definitely not the a**hole - that system was ridiculous and unsustainable and really wouldn\u2019t have worked out in the long run anyway, but I don\u2019t think your husband meant anything damaging by implementing it. Do you know how many dads won\u2019t even read their kid a book let alone 5? And do all those wonderful things?\n\nYou and that child have a good man. Maybe give him his own unique \u201cbed routine\u201d tonight to show your appreciation. NAH.", "NAH - She's growing up at the appropriate rate. You are making reasonable changes and obviously your daughter is able to adapt.\n\nBut try to be gentle and understanding with your husband. This routine was a primary bonding time between father + daughter for over a year. He feels like he's lost that time. Well, how can he get more time with her?", "Depending on how upset your husband is it's either NTA or NAH.  Your husband enjoyed caring for and going above and beyond for his kid, that's a good thing.  Considering how a lot of Dads get when a baby comes (many just sort of check out mentally even if they do stick around physically), it's a really good thing.  However, he needs to understand that things change fast with a kid and if your truncated routine works, he has no right to make you follow it.  If he's seriously pissed off at you and is holding a grudge, NTA and also the dude needs to grow a pair growing up is a process of a child getting less and less dependent on their parents.  If he doesn't understand that, you need to nip this in the bud or else you have a helicopter parenting situation on your hands.  These types of parents make the worst sorts of people.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he's just sort of sad and wistful that the end of the first phase of childhood (infancy) is coming to an end, it's no big deal and it's NAH.  He does need to realize that it is ending.", "NAH. But you see now why he was being insane now right? Just loved his kiddo. You didn't steal anything, kiddos grow up too fast on their own. Parents can be insane sometimes. This is where some couple counselors would remind your hubs on the benefits of a quick kiddo bednight routine....you get to enlarge the adult bedtime routine...if you get my drift....", "YTAH- like it or not it wasnt your choice alone and you dis what was best for you versus what was best for the trip. I know its and unpopular thought but your partner took the most care and you chose to change things bc of what you felt not because of the child(while your child did progress positively) it isnt the case as  a blanket statement", "You're married to a jerk. Why would he want a more complicated bedtime instead of a less?\n\nIs it because it wasn't really Nova's bedtime? It was his?", "NaH - As a parent it bothers me that the first thing you cut was half of the storytime books. \n\nParenting is hard. I'm not trying to make you feel bad. \n\nI hope now that you're saving time with no car and no stroller that you're back up to 5 books or more. \n\nBooks I highly suggest for kids under 3: The Princess and the Pony.

We feel guilty for not spending 'enough' time with our children, alternately, we feel resentment sometimes for how much time we have to spend with our kids.   \n\n\nI hope Mark will thank you after the big feelings subside, because what I read in his routine was a LOT of transitions. Too many. (I was a nanny and would never have accepted a job that required this, it's objectively not good for the child or parent/caregiver.) Routines should be as straightforward and simple as possible. You saw an opportunity to transition to a routine she obviously has adapted to. He sees this as her 'growing up too fast'. You likely see this as her developing a healthy amount of independence and self-reliance.   \n \n\nI'm going to go with NAH, only because I think a good conversation, being honest about feelings, would help smooth things over. It's sometimes difficult in couples for each to let the other parent in a way that feels different or uncomfortable. Ultimately, this was a comforting routine for your husband, too.

You find out what works first, then slowly pare it down to something more reasonable.\n\nAnd unfortunately, whether Mark likes it or not, she will likely have many phases she goes through then grows out of that he will miss when she stops.

That's why you've gotta help teach her good reasonable routines even now while she is very young.\n\nIt is nice to indulge your kids sometimes, but being overly indulgent can make them very difficult to manage as they start to get older.

I suspected as I read it that the bedtime routine was more for your husband than for Nova.  She wouldn't have let go of parts of it if she weren't ready.

It is the hardest thing to learn, and it will keep happening.", "NTA.\n\nI can understand when you are in the first 6 months to do anything to get your baby to sleep, but after that you can't set up unsustainable routines like what you've just described. Sure 5 books the rest is insane.", "NTA Jesus my 12 month old takes less than half that time to go down, I couldn\u2019t possibly keep up that kinda routine! Kudos to you for putting and end to the problem, that just isn\u2019t a healthy or manageable routine.\n\nThat being said I can understand where your husband is coming from. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to be needed, and his routine created a lot of dependency. The time really does fly when you have kids and you want to savor every moment, but the goal of a parent is always to raise healthy, happy, functioning adults. Like others said, he can add one or two short things when your kid gets older so they still have that bonding time, but the routine he created just doesn\u2019t promote healthy sleeping habits", "Nta you saved your daughter from being one spoiled ass child.", "Hopping on the top comment to add that what he did sounds awful for the environment. Wasting all that petrol and using the dryer just to warm up a blanket - he's an asshole for that alone. Your daughter will have to live on this planet longer than you, why not try and keep it livable for her?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
