I used to work a job that often had me on overnight shifts. Mark was left with the night duty for a good chunk of time. I\u2019d be home during the day while he worked and tended to her then. It was a good system. \n\nThen I transferred to a new job and began working normal hours. Mark and I trade off on bedtime. It\u2019s then I realized what a complicated routine Nova has for bed.\n\nIt started with being read 5 books, say goodnight to every stuffed animal then going for a 30 minute car ride. Following that, she had to be rocked in a stroller in the garage. Oh, and on top of that, her blanket had to be warmed in the dryer. Then transferred to crib. One step out of place and Nova would flip.\n\nI spoke to Mark about simplifying the routine and he said no. I tried to argue to keep books but have her fall asleep in her crib. He wouldn\u2019t budge and said as I wasn\u2019t around for bedtime much that first year, I don\u2019t get to change the system now.\n\nI\u2019ve tried it for awhile but it\u2019s exhausting. Eventually during a week when Mark had to pull overtime and was gone at bedtime, little by little, I began dropping things from the routine. First, I\u2019d only read 3 books. Dropped the car ride from 30 minutes to 15 to 10 and finally, it was gone. Stopped warming the blanket. I\u2019d put her in her crib and let her fuss it out if the blankets weren\u2019t just so. She never cried for more than 5 minutes and by night 4, she went right to sleep.\n\nI kept Mark in the loop but he insisted it wouldn\u2019t work. The overtime stopped and he was back splitting bedtime with me. He came to me crying the first night as Nova didn\u2019t want a car ride nor would she settle in the stroller. She went right to sleep in her crib.

It's sweet that your husband worked out a nighttime routine with your daughter that worked for them at the time.\n\nBut kids do grow and change. Rapidly at that age. And quite frankly, the nighttime routine that he had in place was...excessive. \n\nYou haven't stolen anything from him. He can still read your daughter books and take her on car rides. He can warm a blanket for her whenever she wants one. As she ages, he can even introduce new elements into her nightly routine if he wants. \n\nIt's reasonable for him to grieve that this time in his life, which clearly he cherished, is passed. \n\nIt's unreasonable for him to attack you for simplying his elaborate rituals.", "NTA but whoa, you've got parenting issues on your hands.  Mark's methods are extreme and going to lead to real problems (like if you need a babysitter or something) but his attitude is even worse. He wouldn't compromise on what is obviously way too much bedtime routine, he thinks not performing a three ring circus every night is forcing her to grow up too fast, he won't work with you to find a reasonable alternative, and he's obviously getting too much satisfaction on your daughter being completely dependent even in sleep.\n\nFurthermore, his method in no way promotes healthy sleep habits. An 18 month old shouldn't need a car ride and a rock in a stroller. She *should* be able to put herself to sleep alone. Bed time routines are healthy but they should be manageable.  Stories, a cuddle and tuck in, say goodnight to the animals all at once, for example. He is creating a monster. Stick to your guns and suggest a parenting sleep coach (they're out there and do phone consults) so he can hear from an \"expert\" what healthy boundaries are!", "NTA, the previous bedtime routine seems to have been more about Mark's daddy-daughter time than your daughter's needs.", "NTA. What he was doing was unhealthy and allowed Nova to set excessive expectations on the two of you. Kids that age should be going to bed with little difficulty, and this routine was holding back her development toward becoming independent and understanding boundaries. It sounds like you kept at least one book in the routine, and that should be more than enough bedtime quality time. He can bond with her more when it's NOT bedtime.", "NTA\n\nHe was holding her back, and for what? The memories? \n\nYour job is to raise a fully functioning human being. Forcing them into a lengthy, unnecessary routine doesn't set her up for success in the future.\n\nAnd he showed that he wasn't doing it for HER, he was doing it for HIM. He's being selfish in a way that is detrimental to your child.", "NTA that routine was unsustainable. What happens when someone else minds her? A simpler routine is much more beneficial for all of you.", "NTA - That needed to be stopped so she can start developing appropriate bedtime and sleep habits.", "NTA, that\u2019s a lot and it\u2019s not very environmentally or economically friendly to be driving that much.", "Definitely NTA!\n\nOkay this is speaking as an Autistic person who relies on routine to self regulate, and also has multiple Autistic children with their own bedtime routines. That bedtime routine was nuts! \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but that sounds like it takes over an hour? \n\nYeah, you absolutely needed to cut that down majorly. I understand that kids get used to their routines, but for your husband to expect you to maintain that is ridiculous! Honestly I can't believe he's been doing that all this time, or that he's angry that you simplified it!", "NTA. Great job helping to smooth her maturing and bedtime. The more independent a toddler is for bedtime, the less stressed bedtime makes them. Your husband will adjust (he's just missing the extended bonding ritual).", "NTA. Your husband wasn't doing that routine for her benefit, or even because he thought it was required, but for his own. That's not fair to you, and it's frankly unhealthy for her. If that had stretched out, she'd become a toddler, preschooler, and then elementary-aged child with extreme sleep-related needs and limitations. \n\nI'm sad for you that he put up such a fight, tried to make you feel you aren't 'allowed' to have a say, and then went on to treat you badly after you did make positive changes. That speaks poorly of the dynamic in your relationship. Maybe for that reason - as well as for the difficulty that Mark is having with the parenting changes that come with a growing child - you should seek therapy.", "NTA. He knows you can read books and cuddle and hang out all day right?", "NTA that is WAY too much for parent *and* child.", "NTA, that's nuts.  You guys need to have a bigger conversation about parenting styles though, this isn't going to be the last issue.", "NAH. I'm saying this because I'm resistant to point the finger at Mark. He has every right to be sad over the loss of time, I get that totally. BUT...and this is a big one...that nighttime routine he was doing wasn't healthy. There was no opportunity for Nova to learn to self-soothe and fall asleep on her own. Right now, it seems like you took something away but in the end, you have taught her how to help herself fall asleep.\n\nI think we all mourn the loss when our babies start growing up. It's a part of parenthood most of us were not prepared for but it is inevitable. Help him to understand how he can treasure *other* moments with her and how it adds value to your life as a couple because you can put her to bed more quickly and spend quality time together.", "NTA but it would be nice to find some other daddy-daughter bonding for them to do. A good bedtime routine is important, but he clearly wants more time with her, which is wholesome. Something special just for the two of them would probably make Mark feel better.", "YTA for making up this bullshit story and posting it to reddit.", "Awwww. Your husband\u2019s reaction pulled on my heartstrings. \n\nYou are definitely not the a**hole - that system was ridiculous and unsustainable and really wouldn\u2019t have worked out in the long run anyway, but I don\u2019t think your husband meant anything damaging by implementing it. Do you know how many dads won\u2019t even read their kid a book let alone 5? And do all those wonderful things?\n\nYou and that child have a good man. Maybe give him his own unique \u201cbed routine\u201d tonight to show your appreciation. NAH.", "NAH - She's growing up at the appropriate rate. You are making reasonable changes and obviously your daughter is able to adapt.\n\nBut try to be gentle and understanding with your husband. This routine was a primary bonding time between father + daughter for over a year. He feels like he's lost that time. Well, how can he get more time with her?", "Depending on how upset your husband is it's either NTA or NAH.  Your husband enjoyed caring for and going above and beyond for his kid, that's a good thing.  Considering how a lot of Dads get when a baby comes (many just sort of check out mentally even if they do stick around physically), it's a really good thing.  However, he needs to understand that things change fast with a kid and if your truncated routine works, he has no right to make you follow it.  If he's seriously pissed off at you and is holding a grudge, NTA and also the dude needs to grow a pair growing up is a process of a child getting less and less dependent on their parents.  If he doesn't understand that, you need to nip this in the bud or else you have a helicopter parenting situation on your hands.  These types of parents make the worst sorts of people.\n\nIf, on the other hand, he's just sort of sad and wistful that the end of the first phase of childhood (infancy) is coming to an end, it's no big deal and it's NAH.  He does need to realize that it is ending.", "NAH. But you see now why he was being insane now right? Just loved his kiddo. You didn't steal anything, kiddos grow up too fast on their own. Parents can be insane sometimes. This is where some couple counselors would remind your hubs on the benefits of a quick kiddo bednight routine....you get to enlarge the adult bedtime routine...if you get my drift....", "YTAH- like it or not it wasnt your choice alone and you dis what was best for you versus what was best for the trip. I know its and unpopular thought but your partner took the most care and you chose to change things bc of what you felt not because of the child(while your child did progress positively) it isnt the case as  a blanket statement", "You're married to a jerk. Why would he want a more complicated bedtime instead of a less?\n\nIs it because it wasn't really Nova's bedtime? It was his?", "NaH - As a parent it bothers me that the first thing you cut was half of the storytime books. \n\nParenting is hard. I'm not trying to make you feel bad. \n\nI hope now that you're saving time with no car and no stroller that you're back up to 5 books or more. \n\nBooks I highly suggest for kids under 3: The Princess and the Pony. More Bears. Groovy Joe's IceCream and Dinosaurs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Did several books and even sang songs for 30-45 min an evening. When those kids got older... it got REAL hard to back off of that without having total meltdowns. I'm all for consistent nighttime routines, but you're setting yourself up for a bad time having to do that every evening, and heaven forbid you ask a babysitter to do that when you're not around.", "NTA Nova will be a new little person every 2/3 months up until she goes to school and then every 6 months, then every year. I hope Mark can embrace this as it's disconcerting and wonderful in equal measure. She's not a baby anymore.", "Mark's just feeling the same mixed emotions as many parents do when they go back to their work after having a different 'normal'.  We feel guilty for not spending 'enough' time with our children, alternately, we feel resentment sometimes for how much time we have to spend with our kids.   \n\n\nI hope Mark will thank you after the big feelings subside, because what I read in his routine was a LOT of transitions. Too many. (I was a nanny and would never have accepted a job that required this, it's objectively not good for the child or parent/caregiver.) Routines should be as straightforward and simple as possible. You saw an opportunity to transition to a routine she obviously has adapted to. He sees this as her 'growing up too fast'. You likely see this as her developing a healthy amount of independence and self-reliance.   \n \n\nI'm going to go with NAH, only because I think a good conversation, being honest about feelings, would help smooth things over. It's sometimes difficult in couples for each to let the other parent in a way that feels different or uncomfortable. Ultimately, this was a comforting routine for your husband, too. So talk to him about what would make this new routine more comfortable for him, too. Good luck! Transitions are hard, especially when we have babes in the mix!", "NTA, that was far too much for anyone to do nightly. You set a reasonable expectation by weaning it down", "NTA.  Either Your husband has OCD or he's trying to teach your daughter to have it.   That's a ridiculously long routine. Nobody has time for that in their life", "I can see where this would be frustrating but why cut the whole thing? Why not read the books and warm the blanket? It sounds like this was a sweet and meaningful routine for your husband. He pretty much begged you not to end it but you did anyway.  I get wanting to shorten it, so yeah, cut the car ride and the stroller thing. But the books and want blanket are reasonable and those are things some people do up until their kids are a lot older. I\u2019m going with yta because you knew this was important to him but you didn\u2019t care.", "I\u2019m exhausted reading all that\u2026 my 20 month old son doesn\u2019t even get half of that. 7pm we head upstairs, he has a little run around get the last of energy out for 10 minutes, drink, brush teeth, put tonies and night lamp on, give blanket. Sweet dreams good night done. \n30 minute drives every night? Fuel is EXPENSIVE and totally unecessary. Also babies don\u2019t really need baths every single night. Sheesh!", "Nta", "NTA. Your husband did that bedtime routine for himself.", "NTA, but she\u2019s 18m now and will soon not be a baby, perhaps you can introduce bathtime before bed? Our routine is bathtime (we don\u2019t wash them every day, some days is just playing with toys in the bath), followed by teeth and pj\u2019s, followed by 2 books & milk with a cuddle, then bed. All done in 30 minutes. Bathtime is a really nice way to spend some time with a toddler before bedtime and can be shorter or longer depending on start time and how tired they are.", "The reason your kid stopped 'fussing' as you put it is bc she realized (as a BABY) that you wouldn't be there for her.  Nobody would.  That it's just her there at night, alone.\n\nYou're a gigantic asshat.  You made your kid distrust your husband..wtf?! Plus ANYONE who'd rather have their child cry than comfort them is the worst parent in the world. \n\nI came from parents like you, and you're despicable.", "NTA. She\u2019s over a year old now. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for there to be a short bedtime routine as she gets older. It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re throwing her in the crib and calling it a night. There\u2019s still a routine that works for her it\u2019s just now 1.5 hours long. He\u2019ll live.", "i could be wrong but like, aren\u2019t blankets supposed to not be in cribs for safe sleeping?", "NTA but you did steal this from him but as parents our children grow they have to and that bed time routine was ridiculous. Mark needs to find another more healthy ritual to spend with Nova now and that should be ok. As we grow our routines change.", "Great explanation! NTA, but you both are doing a great job with her.", "Honestly, the bedtime routine dad setup sounds exhausting to maintain. Bare minimum, you're looking at a 90 minute routine every. Single. Day. At that was fine when he was the only one putting their child to bed. But now that they share the responsibility, the routine needs to be simplified.", "This is the way to communicate it OP. Offer to have a ritual to FaceTime at lunch or eat breakfast together if he is missing that time with her", "Maybe have him record parts of their routine that he loves to immortalize it and then change it up to help ease the way?", "You are making reasonable changes and obviously your daughter is able to adapt.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t list in the normal things that go with bedtime either (bath, lotion, pajamas). Combined with that, it took me an hour and a half.

You definitely did the right thing by cutting it back. How would you ever be able to use a babysitter with a routine like that?", "It should not take AN HOUR to put a child to bed! When is there time to relax before you go to bed??", "That is insane, especially for an 18 month old. I love putting my youngest to sleep and we have a little routine,  but I also know my husband has a different routine,  since I work graveyard a couple nights a week. How on Earth is your little girl supposed to learn to self-sooth with all that ridiculousness.  This is how people end up with toddlers and young children who take hours to put to bed.", "5 is a lot, I don't get the sticking point here. Reading *something* is important, but I can guarantee an 18 MO doesn't have the full attention span to read that much at once anyways. We did 1-2 board books an evening with ours until about 2, then gradually started working it towards 1 longer book/chapter book an evening.", "Good luck.", "His daughter. They're both men", "Since OP wasn't home, I wonder if this was his relaxing before bed time?
