Still not your obligation whatsoever to purchase the medicine for her or sell your personal items.  2) She has the money and is trying to scam you into paying.  \n\nNeither possibility is your issue or your obligation to help just because your friendly.", " NTA - this is weird, your neighbor is ballsy demanding you sell stuff to get her medicine.  Have you borrowed money from her before?", "And why can't SHE sell something of hers to get the money for her medication?\n\nTotally NTA. I would have said No too.\n\nDiabetes can be really serious if not monitored properly. Why in hell would she let her medication lapse to the point of harassing her neighbours to sell their personal stuff so she can get it?", "NTA\n\nShe expects you to sell something to pay for her medication!? How about SHE sells something to pay for her medication?", "NTA. Why doesn't your neighbor sell something of hers to get the money to buy her medication? That's fucked up. Honestly, she's probably only nice to you because she thinks she can get something from you. Sorry, but people like that do walk amongst us. I'd scale back my interactions with her, big time. \n\nEither way, you're not the AH here.", "NTA. There is no law saying you have to pay for your neighbor's medication. If you don't have the money for it, then you don't have the money. You're not in the wrong.", "NTA. What an odd thing to demand.", "NTA - this is in no way shape or form your responsibility.  Think about the reason she is asking you - not family, not close friends, not co-workers.... She's probably already done this to everyone and they are done.  Respond to her \"sorry you feel that way\" end.

If this is really about insulin surely she has something she can sell.", "NTA - your neighbour can sell her own things", "NTA. This doesn\u2019t even sound like a one off situation as there will always be a need for medication. She\u2019s in unfortunate circumstances but you don\u2019t owe her anything by virtue of being her neighbour to fund her medication needs. Asking you to sell your stuff for her isn\u2019t a sustainable proposition.", "NTA, but have you considered that she's probably desperate? I wouldn't necessarily purchase the medication if I was tight on money, but it is important the nondiabetic population understands what's happening right now. Diabetes medicine is now so expensive that people are dying because they can't afford the medically necessary medicines. You can thank the drug companies who have done this despite it being unnecessary for their profits. Everyone here needs to understand that anyone they know with diabetes is facing mortal danger and may die soon.\n\nYou're not an AH at all even if you don't help her knowing this information. Also, it wouldn't help, you could sell everything you own and give it to her and it would only help her temporarily.\n\nJust know, diabetics are being murdered by their drug companies right now.", "Just an FYI, Walmart sells over the counter insulin (their brand) for $25 a vial.  It comes in both short and long lasting types.", "NTA\n\nBeing nice to someone doesn't entitle them to compensation. She's essentially wanting you to pay for friendship. She asked, you declined for legitimate reasons. She pressed and is mad...she is in the wrong. Also, expect the \"friendship\" to disappear.", "NTA.\n\nDon't start this way, it will be your downfall. And don't let her pressure you or blackmail. Diabetes sucks, but it is not your responsibility to pay for her meds. If you pay once you will be pressured to pay again and again - and then perhaps also help her with bills, rent...\n\nAnd being nice? That is normal behaviour I expect from other people. If she uses that as reasoning for you having to pay the meds it is most likely sure that she planned on doing this from the start. So, greet her nicely, but otherwise stay away.", "NTA. What world does this women live in?? You sell something of yours to afford her meds? In what universe are you responsible for ensuring a random neighbor has meds? That's not how the world works. She can sell her own stuff if she needs money, not demand it from you.", "NTA and odds are good it ain\u2019t the \u2018medicine\u2019 for her diabetes she wants so bad she\u2019s hitting up casual acquaintances to sell their possessions so she can purchase.", "NTA - the real assholes are the people selling medication for abnormal prices. But she can sell her own stuff", "NTA.  Has she sold everything she has to be able to afford it?  Doubt it.\n\nShe's a taker.  Takers take, it's what they do.  They take until the giver won't give, or has nothing left to give, anymore.  They find new people to take from.  \n\nDon't be surprised when she no longer has any use for you.  You will likely become her enemy for having the audacity of saving no.", "NTA.", "Nta. Rude to ask you to sell ur items, when she can do the same.

Being nice does not automatically force people to give you things or to sell things so she can have something. I would avoid her from now on.", "NTA. It\u2019s sad she needs help with affording her insulin, but if you help her now, she\u2019ll be coming to you in the future. Tell her to contact the American Diabetes Association; they have programs for people in her situation.", "Nta. Her health condition is her responsibility. I know diabetes medication is expensive and probably not the easiest to get but it\u2019s her duty to make sure she\u2019s on top of it. I would maybe offer to help her look for a program that offers financial assistance or something but I wouldn\u2019t be paying for someone else\u2019s medication, especially if I didn\u2019t have the money to do so.", "NTA but as a human being, if you can do this, please do. Also, send her to GoodRX and hopefully costplusdrugs will have it soon . In the future, it is cheaper to buy a train or plane or bus ticket to Canada, get the prescription filled for three months, stay in a hotel overnight, and travel home than to get insulin in the US. She may end up basically camping at the ER until she has money to buy her medicine at this point, and getting ER treatments as needed to stay alive :(", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why cant she sell something of hers if she is so desperate? Or ask family etc? Your in no way responsible for her or her medication.", "I'm type 2 and was on insulin. There are programs in place for reduced cost and some doctors will maximize prescriptions so you end up getting more bang for your buck", "NTA. She's trying to scam you one way or another. If no one she knows will help her, then she's probably burned them before. Keep away from her and make sure you have video cameras. She's gonna try and scam you again. I had a neighbor like this.

But you know who the real asshole is? The US Healthcare system where the cost of insulin, which shouldn't be more than a few dollars is like hundreds of dollars per month depending on how much you need. Absolutely baffling to me how my country, the richest country in the world, can have people unable to afford insulin.", "3, she spent her money on something else", "No I haven\u2019t and I\u2019ve never asked her for money. Maybe she asked other people close to her and they probably told her no too.", "Because despite a production cost of less than $12/months supply, the current cost is over $600/month. More if you need more insulin. It's stupidly expensive, and over 95% of the cost is simply profit. They keep raising the price, knowing that since people HAVE to have it to live, they will literally sell everything and live in a tent or not live at all. They're looking to sit exactly at the point where the profit and the rate of death due to not being able to afford it yield the most income for them. Edited to add: see if you can point her to a church or other organization that can sometimes help with medical emergencies", "That's my first question too. Why doesn't she sale her stuff first. This whole situation is so odd.", "This. And even if you had the money, there is no obligation to spend it on medication for your neighbor. It is not your responsibility.", "I don\u2019t understand how countries allow this to happen.

You\u2019re NTA, but you need to read this.", "Insulin manufacturers have programs available. Mine was $99/mo", "Honestly? With inflation and the cost of insulin, I'm actually not doubting her story at all.

If you\u2019ve said yes this one time she will ask, demand and expect it from you over and over again. You shut her down the first time she asked, good for you for setting boundaries.", "Yep, we have the same issues with diabetic foster cats. Diabetic foster pet organizations are always looking for people to donate insulin from family members who have passed away, because it is prohibitively expensive.", "See if her manufacturer has programs.mine has a program for low-income, and others for anybody.", "Reading this comment has me mentally throwing out my sugary snacks and cereals.", "If doctors did that in the US, fast food companies would probably sue them. Never forget, in the US, freedom is actually second after corporate profits. Look up the US in the late 1800s, that's basically what we are right now.\n\nI would absolutely be down for a system like your county's, that sounds like a fair way to approach health care while keeping medical costs down.", "Yeah, I saw some of the other comments and realized they didn't understand the entire situation. It disturbing that it's happening and so many people don't seem to know.", "I hope some of the other commenters read this too.", "Insulin *is* outrageously and ridiculously expensive\u2026I agree with you there!  The last vial I bought was $328.

And that was AFTER hitting up goodrx.", "It can't be prevented but it can be controlled and the amount of insulin used drastically decreased with dietary changes", "Thats type two, presumably the neighbour has type one which cannot be controlled or decreased by diet. My pancreas hasn't worked for twenty years, and cutting out chocolate isn't going to get it to work", "It works for type 1 as well, it's done slightly differently and won't eliminate the need for insulin, but it can be greatly reduced. I've seen it done with both types. It's not just cutting out chocolate, there are doctors everywhere doing it currently", "Here's the thing, moderating your diet to that point is expensive, so no costs savings really."]}
