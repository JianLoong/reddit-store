As a mom, I would never imagine burdening my children with financial issues. As a family of 7, we are tight on money, but I always pretend in front of my kids that we are doing alright. I\u2019m not saying that every parent has to go to extreme lengths like that, but at least they should keep it to themselves. The households income should never be a 13 year olds problem.", "NTA \n\nIs there a trusted adult you can turn to who can help your mom see that they are discussing finances with you in a way that\u2019s stressing you out? Maybe your dad or an aunt/uncle or grandparent?\n\nIt is completely inappropriate for a parent to lay their mental burdens down on their minor child. It\u2019s one thing to say we need to economize and stick to a budget (acceptable)  but it\u2019s totally different to burden your child with all of your financial concerns. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this. \n\nAnd incidentally you\u2019re 100% right. Buying a new car is rarely the best financial decision. The most depreciation happens in the first couple of years. It\u2019s usually much more fiscally responsible to buy a certified used car  of a make/model with a proven safety and reliability record. It sounds like your mom needs help making sound financial decisions, so she should seek help from someone with more experience.", "NTA that is a subject that isn\u2019t your responsibility and shouldn\u2019t concern you. She is putting her adult problems on a child. That is not ok.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m sorry that this is happening.", "NTA. You asked her to stop and she didn't. Keep setting and trying to protect those boundaries, however hard it gets.", "NTA", "Lol. You screamed at your mom, told her to shut up, stated how you buy stuff with your money, and you are wondering if you are the AH? Seriously?", "Never burden a child with adult issues in which they have no control.  Mom is an AH", "I'm an adult who had a similar scenario when I was about your age. It took me DECADES and a lot of therapy to overcome my anxiety about finances and money in general. Your mom is harming you by continuing to share her money concerns. Telling you that she can't afford to buy you a new iPhone (for example) is one thing, but instilling this anxiety in you is another.", "NTA. She shouldn't be stressing you out with this. She needs to use her friends as a sounding board, not her daughter. You are 13 - no offense, but you can't help her with anything beyond what you're doing already. \n\nYou're okay for exploding on her, it's normal to feel guilty as well. You can apologize to her, but say you can't do anything about her money trouble and that the complaining stresses you out because it's making you feel helpless and anxious about the family finances.", "NTA. First of all, you're right, buying a used car, even only a couple of years old makes much more financial sense than buying a new one. Also.  You're too young to be burdened with this. I can understand your mum being stressed about this, but she shouldn't put this on you.", "My mother talked about finances a lot during my entire childhood. She even asked me to give her money(if you have money hide it and never talk about it). I was so stressed that I wouldn't even ask for necessities. Children and teens should not be part of any conversation about financial problems. I am a grown adult now and still stress about finances. \n\nYou tried and set a healthy boundary with your mother. To set a proper boundary you have to have an action you take when she breaks it. Unfortunately a boundary isn't just asking someone not to do it.\n\nPerhaps saying I am sorry I yelled. I was extremely upset as I have asked you not to discuss finances with me as it causes me stress and harm. Next time if you are unable to do so I will leave the room or something else that works for you.\n\nMy suggestion is because you are a minor. I am sorry this is happening to you. You are NTA.", "Yeah, I wonder as well. It is clear that OP is not the asshole at all and the mother should look for adults to vent about her problems. OP stated her boundaries calmly, but mom didn't listen. Mom is the adult and should start to act like it. I am also still in therapy due to similar issues with my mom growing up. I wish OP all the best.", "She is 13... Her misgivings will mature over time. She is too young to be burdened by financial issues.", "You are a CHILD. It is NOT your responsibility to be concerned about your mom's finances. It's sweet of you to care but you have begged her over and over to stop stressing you out over things you can't change and may blame yourself for when you are 100% not at fault for existing or having needs or your mom's choices. I suggest duel counseling since you both do seem to care about each other, but she clearly is overly stressed and your relationship may become more strained without intervention and mediation. It's healthy for everyone really."]}
