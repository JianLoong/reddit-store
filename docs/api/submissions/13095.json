We plan to move together to DC in the summer. \n\nI know that it is inevitable for his daughter to come and live with us but I recently asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind letting her stay with her mom for a year while we establish our foundation in our marriage, find a place to live and get a routine together between ourselves. He thinks that I don\u2019t like his daughter and that is not true at all. I just know that most marriages fail after the first few years and I don\u2019t want that. I want us to get through the first rough year and then we can add more stress like his parenting. \n\nAgain, he knows that I will not be serving as a mother for her but I\u2019m fine being her friend. The daughter likes me and we have a good friendship but idk, AITA?\n\nEdit: the mom does not want to be the custodial parent and signed over her rights but she is still a legal parent and gets the daughter every other weekend and for vacations (like a month in the summer).", "created_utc": 1679687044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120vsdo/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_let_his_daughter/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you wanted a childfree life you shouldn\u2019t be involved with someone who has a kid.\n\nYou have a relationship that involves a child. That involvement is the same from day one.

You don't like his daughter. You sound like you resent her actually. Overall, you are not the ah for not wanting to \"serve as a mother figure\" but you are the ah for wanting to pretend that she doesn't exist. Even if she goes to live with her mom, she will not be out of your life.

YTA. \n\n>I just know that most marriages fail after the first few years and I don\u2019t want that.\n\nThey fail at a later stage too because people involved finally realise what they signed up for and if they aren't cooperative to work things out then it is bound to fail irrespective of the time.

You knew he had a daughter but still chose to marry him. I hope he decides to divorce your ass and keep his daughter", "You are an incredible asshole.

You are also the wicked step mother.", "HUGE YTA. I find this sooooo infuriating. This isn\u2019t parent trap and you can\u2019t just ship off the kid. \n\nThis makes me so sad for his daughter.", "YTA - and why the hell did he marry you?", "Wow , are you serious ?", "Yta!!!! She's a CHILD, you don't get to uproot her because it's \"easier\" for you. Her safety and well being trumps yours. Man I hope he divorces you.", "Is this a joke? YTA. She's his CHILD.

People like you are the reason those marriages fail.", "YTA\nI understand ask the child to stay with her mother for a short time while you relocate, but a year? \nIf he has full custody there must be a reason. Also establish YOUR routine\u2026 but why? if he has full custody of a child, then that routine will be worth 0 as you have to insert the routine of a minor and change everything once again. Kids are not furniture you can put in a storage facility il until you are done repairing your walls and decide the color of your curtains and find your child free routine. You know you were marrying a man with a child and full custody at that. You may not play the role of the mother, but very much consider the child in your daily life.", "YTA\n\nAs you said, you knew when you got into this that the daughter was part of the package.  Also, it's kind of uncommon for the father to have full custody, which makes me think that there is some issue with the mother not being able to competently care for his daughter (otherwise they would probably have shared custody).  Also, this is presumably going to be a life relationship, which means a lifetime relationship with the daughter, so you should probably start building that right away.  \n\nThe daughter is probably not going to be too fond of you if she finds out that you are trying to get her father to ditch her for a year.  My mother remarried when I was about that age and if I found out that her new husband asked her to send me off for a year I would have been pretty furious, basically unforgivable.\n\nI guess it's fine to talk about, but asking a parent to bail on their child for a year is a pretty huge, and pretty strange thing to ask for and I'd be surprised if he is open to it.", "YTA. You knew what you were getting into. Telling him to pawn off his daughter for a year is absolutely ruthless. It's not fair to ask this of a parent. Just like it's not fair to live with a child, full time it appears, and expect not to be somewhat of a mother figure.\n\nIt truly doesn't seem like your expectations match reality here. Why date and even marry a father, if you're not ready to be in the child's life? She will feel that rejection. And at this age she will think it's hear, when in reality it's absolutely you.", "YTA.  Don't marry someone with kids if you need them to disown their own child to make it work.\n\nEither you already killed the relationship or your marrying someone who would be willing to give up on his own kid.  Which means he'd be willing to do the same to yours.", "Wow, what kind of sick individual wants to throw out her husband\u2019s daughter now they are married? Oh that\u2019s right you. I sincerely have nothing but bad wishes for you in the future.\n\nYTA", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA tbh. Having her stay with her mom for a year uproots her life, and you are marrying him knowing he has full custody. Also, what happens after a year? Are you going to ask her to stay with her mother longer if you still don\u2019t want her to live with you both?", "YTA.\n\nA good marriage will last a lifetime. He only has his daughter till she is grown so don't ask him to cut the time he does have with her even shorter.\n\nYou knew he was a father when you married him. You knew he had this responsibility.

Dear lord, what kind of bait-and-switch game are you trying to play?!", "YTA\n\nIf the kid were like 19+ then it would be a different matter but at 10 a whole year is like a new lifetime and it wouldn't be fair to have you decide which parent she gets to spend that with.\n\nIf you're concerned about adding too much too fast then get yourself an apartment close to their home and slowly move in (like sleep over every other day)  That way you guys still have a place to cool off if things are too much and the kid gets to have a stable life. \nPlus you can make a plan with your husband so you still get time alone together when she's with her mother. But the kid comes first.", "YTA for the obvious reasons, which have already been stated,  but also because that is such a long time to be without one's child. Do you not care that he'd be missing her the whole time? If I had to go a year without seeing my kid, I'd be sad the whole time.", "YTA \u2013 This is not a small ask.  If you wanted the daughter to not live with you for a year, that conversation should have happened way earlier than this.  This poor girl is already going to be uprooted, and your plan is only going to make that more painful for her.  Also, what would be the point in establishing \"a routine together between ourselves,\" just to have it changed when your step daughter arrives?  Wouldn't it be better to get a good family routine from the start?", "Yes YTA, massively. You married a a parent and he doesn\u2019t just get to ditch his daughter for a year because his new wife has suddenly gone evil stepmother.

Yeah this is a shit show and YTA!", "This might be the worst thing I\u2019ve read here", "This, all of this", "OP needs to understand that the daughter should be a huge piece of the foundation that should be built. If she doesn't want that, then she shouldn't have married someone with children. Honestly sounds like OP is hoping his daughter will spend more time with her mother so she doesnt have to see her often.", "All day?? At least All year..and that is saying something here!", "Thank you!  Don't start a family (including step children) if you don't want the whole family!", "Maybe part of her 'decision to love' her husband was to hold this little nugget of an idea in her back pocket, thinking he'd bite after they were married.

Like what kind of twisted logic to establish a routine of a childless couple. When there is already a child.

I read this line:\n\n> I just know that most marriages fail after the first few years and I don\u2019t want that.\n\nand thought OP is making it a guaranty that the marriage fails.  Asking this, I'd be surprised if the husband makes it to the summer when they are supposed to move in together.

Dangerous line to toe with a potentially hormonal pre-teen girl...

HUGE part of establishing a marriage is also establishing how you parent if you choose to have children or are with a partner whom has children. How you will fit in the mold of parenthood both together and separately is such a vital part to a relationship. Thank you for saying this.", "It would be foolish to \u201cestablish a foundation\u201d and THEN toss a kid into the mix. They need to build it together. \n\nAnd make no mistake, if biomom is pretty much opting out of the maternal role, this child is likely to want and need stepmom to function as a parent to some degree. In fact, just the fact that this child will be with them full time is sure to give the stepmom a parental role in the child\u2019s eyes. \n\n\nSource: am a stepmom to a son whose biomom didn\u2019t step up.

You don't get to toss her aside b/c it is inconvenient to your ideal newlywed life. She's going to be there forever. Maybe get used to it now.", "Further INFO:\n\nWhere are you getting this idea that the first year of marriage is some kind of trial by fire? That's something that happens if you've never lived together before marriage, I guess, or if you married the wrong person, but me and my husband's first year of marriage was easy-peasy. Ditto the second year, even through a wide variety of shitstorms.\n\nAlso: Why did you marry a man who has a child if you were not prepared to live with that child? You can't just request your husband stop being a dad for an entire fucking year because you decided to marry a guy who doesn't even live where you do and who has a kid you don't want.", "YTA. Massively. You sound like the antagonist girlfriend from The Parent Trap. The child needs her Dad. Her mother has made it clear she does not want her. Can you imagine how she\u2019s going to feel if she finds out you want to ship her off to her mom when she knows she either doesn\u2019t want her or can\u2019t care for her properly? Let alone if her Dad actually does that but I sincerely doubt he will or will even be able to do so with their agreement. You say you knew what you were signing up for but it doesn\u2019t sound like it. You signed up to marry a man with full custody of his daughter. That means living in a house with said daughter until she grows up and moves away.", "Wow, you are so selfish and I hope your husband is rethinking the marriage.

Just adding on that if she thinks she has a good friendship with the daughter, go ahead and tell her you don't want her there for a year and see how well that holds up.", "Oh gotcha missed that reading your comment intially thanks :)", "I dont think the person i asked the question to was being hurtful but being realistic. The dad should have known better than marry someone who isnt ready to be part of a family.", "Except it could have been prevented when she made it clear she didn't want to be a stepmom... \n\nYes, he sucks!", "Truth!", "LOL NP! I do the same thing myself.", "Fair enough, I just interpreted it as him knowing she doesn't want to be a mother figure like being called mom etc. I didn't imagine he knew she'd want to pack his daughter off out of their lives.", "\"No desire to serve as a mother figure\" can just mean not being referred to as mom though...."]}
