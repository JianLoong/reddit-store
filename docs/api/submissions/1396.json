I have been having some cough problems and it sound like theres slime in your lungs when you cough. And I can just start fake coughing and nobody will realise it. So when it was between classes 2 girls(1 is my crush) were in the classroom with me just sharing stories and have a talk and I cough badly, my crush just asks \"are you okay? Are you sure you dont wanna stay at home?\" she is the shy, quiet, short girl so Im having my lungs failing and my heart melting bc I didnt recieve this much attention in like a month. Tomorrow we were outside and again my lungs were like failing almost. I was around girls (again, but I still cant pull girls) and I could hear one of the girls go \"ugh\" when she noticed I was coughing. My crush went \"Do you want me to go get a teacher?\". I did this for a few days and also took break when I didnt cough so she wouldnt be suspicious about me. It breaks my heart when I think about her realising about this but this gives me a new feeling, a power to fight God or die trying.\n. \nI just wanna make sure Im not the asshole here.", "created_utc": 1667596042, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymah2l/aita_for_fake_coughing/", "score": 0, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Saying you're a minor in your post leads me to believe you don't want anyone actually criticising your behaviour.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t fake a cough because others might think you\u2019re contagious and they will stay away from you.", "YTA because this is how munchausens starts. You\u2019re deceiving someone for your own benefit, which is shitty.", "Thank you. But I still have that sh*t in my lungs. How long is it until it goes away? I can control it so I suppress my cough but they still have ears lol.", "Thank you. Now Im off to be alone I guess. I cant hurt anyone if I dont interact with anyone lol.", "You\u2019ll need to talk to a doctor to know why it\u2019s happening and how to stop it.", "My guy, cringy shit like this might be why they don't want to interact with you. Treat people like people, not objects, not benchmarks, and recognize that everyone is entitled to having their own thoughts and preoccupations, and you're much more likely to have more positive relationships. Some of which might even develop romantically."]}
