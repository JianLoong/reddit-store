Your sister is more than old enough to understand that: \n\n1. People don't want to be bothered when they're taking a shit.\n\n2. You have a medical condition that means you need more time in the bathroom than most people.", "NTA. People close the door for privacy. For her to involve herself in your toilet habits is creepy. Making someone else feel vulnerable and annoyed is not just messing around.\n\nIn a calm moment, sit her down and ask her what she hopes to achieve by this. Tell her it gives you only negative feelings about her and ask her if that was her goal. Listen to her answer, because she might have something else going on that needs addressing.", "NTA. Personally, I\u2019d start doing the same to her whenever she\u2019s in the bathroom/her room/start banging on the table when she\u2019s eating etc. so she realizes how annoying and frustrating it is.

You're sister is absolutely TA in this situation.  She is old enough to understand what she is doing and why it's wrong.  You're parents are also TA's for allowing her to continue and enabling her behavior.", "NTA. A 13 year old needs to be taught boundaries. You taught her yours.", "Nta. Your sister isn't a kid anymore and she understands what she does.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being rude. You\u2019ve asked your sister repeatedly to leave you alone in the bathroom and everyone in the house is well aware that you need your privacy when in the bathroom- and that should be a given to ANYONE using the bathroom in general. \n\nIt\u2019s not like she between the ages of 3-8 years old, she\u2019s 13, that old enough to start warranting your own personal space, so why infringe on yours? \n\nI think if there was any way you could have gone about it that could be wrong is if you wanted to talk to your parents and ask them if they could talk to your sister first, but I feel like that\u2019s only applicable if she was younger than 9, if she was special needs, or after you\u2019ve talked and maybe even yelled a couple of times to see if she gets it. If it takes a few times for you to get heated and your sister is still being inconsiderate, then older adults should be involved.", "NTA, your sister is a teenage brat, and your parents are not helping by letting her \"mess\" around when you are in the bathroom.", "NTA. She's 13 and knows what she's doing. Yes, she is still a young child. They are annoying and obnoxious, but usually because they want attention. She loves you and wants to pick on you.", "NTA. What you tolerate is what will continue. Your sister needs to learn some respect for others.", "nta. she\u2019s 13, she needs to grow up. honestly it\u2019s probably the parents fault for letting her think it\u2019s okay to behave that way.", "Not too harsh, NTA.", "NTA and quite frankly? Your sister is weird.", "NTA\n\nBang on her door at all hours of the night and giggle.  When they yell at you, tell them that is kind of harsh.

Like yeah, sure, it's always better to keep your cool than to lose your cool.\n\nIt's also better not to incessantly pester someone doing shit you KNOW they don't want you to do, for no reason other than because you enjoy that it bothers them, until they finally snap at you. Your sister isn't the victim here, and 13 is more than old enough to be taking some responsibility for her actions.", "NTA. Next time ask her if she has a bathroom fetish.", "Not too harsh.
