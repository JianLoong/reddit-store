We split up when he moved away for college and became an absent father even when he returned for the summers. He started becoming more active when he moved back after graduating and we started doing 50/50 custody. I was 24 then and went to community college and got into sonography school and Im now a obstetric sonographer. During that time it came out that my ex never graduated and was in enormous debt from gambling during his time away. It explained why with a full ride scholarship and a \u201cdegree\u201d in a high paying field he was working at the mall. Once I got a job I was able to upgrade my standard of living and provide a better life for me and my son. \n\nHes now turning 17 and entering senior year soon and I want to get him a nice gift to celebrate his birthday this summer. I asked him earlier this year when we were talking about cars what car he would want and he said a 2023 Camry. While we are financially well off and dont struggle, I know he thinks buying a car is out of our budget so he didnt suspect a thing.\n\n\nHeres the issue. I was speaking to my exes sister whom I am semi close with and I brought up the idea to her. She seemed excited, but then said I shouldnt. She said it makes her brother look bad since he doesnt have a car and it would crush him to know that his son has a brand new paid off car while he barely scrapes by. I told her thats not my issue and that its not my fault he doesnt have his life together. Hes 33 and still lives at home, doesnt have a car, and constantly switches retail jobs after spending weeks stretching out watching orientation videos as long as he can. My son was telling me how he recently spent almost two months watching Home Depot orientation videos and then quitting the first week on the floor. He doesnt want to work hard so why should I feel bad?\n\nAfter a few days she calls me and says she has an amazing compromise. She told my ex that I plan to buy a \u201cspecial\u201d gift for my son this summer and asked if he was willing to pitch in. He offered 80 dollars and she is going to add another 80 to total it to be 160. Then we could tell our son we bought it together and he feels like his dad pitched in. This is for a 34k car. I told her no thanks, I have it covered and she got upset and said this could bring my son closer to his father since they dont have much of a relationship and to not be a selfish asshole. Ever since I said no shes called me twice calling me an asshole and saying I should either let him chip in or not buy it at all.

Your son is a smart kid.  He\u2019s not going to be fooled into believing dear old dad came through.", "NTA.\n\nYour money, do what you want. Tell your ex to buy some fuzzy dice or whatever but remind your ex that these are a prop and he can't gamble with them.\n\nIf he wants to pitch in and his sister tell them each to pony up the $11.3k", "Hahahaha Is she fucking kidding??? NTA. So she doesn\u2019t want her brother \u201cto feel bad that his son has a car and he doesn\u2019t\u201d, omg, they need to grow up. He does not work to improve his life, it sounds like and that is not for your or your son to feel bad about. And now they want to chip in a couple of hundred on a $34,000 car to try and make it sound like they bought it too??? Please. Your son is smart enough he would see through that anyway. Also, if he isn\u2019t close to his son, that sounds like that is on him, as well. Good for you for working hard to give him a good life. You don\u2019t owe them anything.", "LOL your ex and his sister are being ridiculous. NTA.", "NTA \n\nIf he wants to contribute, he can pay for the monthly insurance or buy some fun accessory for the car. You worked hard to buy your a son a car, and your ex should be happy you can provide for your son.", "NTA. His financial insecurity and his feelings are none of your business.", "NTA.  Dad cam purchase a separate gift that is in his budget.", "NTA. Next time, correct ex's sister & inform her that the reason son & father don't have a close relationship is, in fact, because dad is a selfish asshole. Not you. You put in the work to earn what you need to take care of your son how you see fit. Dad hasn't - that's his problem, not yours. Also inform her that your son is 17, not 7...he is going to know who actually bought him that car regardless of what you all tell him.", "NTA\nDear OP, I'm concerned that your son would lose confidence in you if you agreed to this proposal because:\n1. A joint gift of an expensive item infers that his Dad contributed substantially or went into debt to do so.\n2. He knows his Dad doesn't have much of an income.\nIt just won't make sense to him.\n\nTo preserve integrity, the suggestions other redditors made for the Dad to gift a gas card or similar seem more suitable.\n\nCongratulations on your son's graduation! \ud83c\udf93", "NTA, they want you to pay for most of the car then said it's from them too, like they paid way more? That's so tacky. Tell them to get things for the car with the money.", "So, he will contribute with his sister 160 dollars of a 34k car?  Just so he can tell his son he got him the car as well?  He and his sister are AHs.  Selfish?  You putting up 99.9 %.  You're not selfish, he is.", "NTA but clearly not ur friend more likely she was sticking close by for info", "NTA.  You might suggest back that they could provide him a gas card for the new card.", "NTA tell your ex your son can pick him up in his brand new car and spend that $80 on a birthday dinner.", "Ugh they are both toxic, offering to chip in 160 is truly a slap in the face to you and they are calling you the asshole what a joke.

I say again, your son is a smart kid, he sees your ex slacking, he is not going to believe for a minute your ex significantly contributed to the car.\n\nHere\u2019s the other thing, say son believes ex paid for half.
