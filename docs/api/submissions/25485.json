My husband and I both work full time corporate jobs so we don\u2019t get home until 5-6pm every night. We used to have a nanny who would pick the kids up from school and stay at home until one of us came back. Almost a year ago, my father unfortunately passed leaving my mother (60F) alone, so between her, my husband and I, we all thought it\u2019d be best for my mother to move in with us.\n\nIt basically became the arrangement that my husband and I renovated our home to create an in law suite for my mom to live in full time and we help take care of her bills, and she will essentially replace our nanny and look after our kids 2:30pm-6pm Monday-Friday. It\u2019s been great having her around, but the issue is that my brother (32M) and his wife (SIL) think it\u2019s unfair and showing \u201cfavorites\u201d if my mom only babysits my kids and not theirs.\n\nLast week, SIL literally just dropped off her kids (2 and 4) at my house as soon as my husband I left for work and I only found out through my Ring camera. My husband and I don\u2019t want my brother\u2019s kids at our house because 1) they\u2019re very young and our house is not babyproofed and has many fragile items I know they will try to get into 2) the 4yo is extremely spoiled and his parents never say no or give him consequences so he goes to anyone\u2019s house and has bad behavior 3) my mom only watches my kids for about three hours everyday, but my SIL is dropping off her kids ALL day at MY house even when my kids aren\u2019t being watched.\n\nI talked to my mom and she said she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s comfortable with watching 4 kids at once but she\u2019ll try if needed and it\u2019s ultimately up to me if my brother\u2019s kids can come over since it\u2019s my house. So I told my brother and SIL no and SIL has been sending me the rudest messages about how I\u2019m turning my kids spoiled and letting them have their grandmother\u2019s favoritism etc etc. Also that I could afford a nanny but I\u2019m choosing to \u201cuse\u201d my mother when she and my brother can\u2019t afford other childcare. I just reminded her that she\u2019s a SAHM and it\u2019s her JOB to look after her kids, not my mother\u2019s, and blocked her. So AITA?\n\n\nAdding for clarification from some comments I\u2019ve gotten: I have absolutely no issues if my mom wants to go over to my brother\u2019s/SIL house to watch their kids! But my issue is that SIL wants to just drop her kids off at my house ALL day to have my mother watch them so SIL can have an empty/mess free house. She\u2019s basically trying to use my mom and my house as a daycare. Also I take deep issue with her just dropping of her kids at my house without notifying me/my husband or even asking my mom.", "created_utc": 1692981574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1614a4t/aita_for_wanting_my_mom_to_only_babysit_my_kids/", "score": 1727, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You went to the trouble and expense to set up a nice place for your mom to live so she would not be alone, and you all agreed to a small amount of babysitting\u2014in her shoes, I would insist on contributing this way.

They do need Grandma to watch their kids sometimes, though, like for date nights.  NTA assuming you all are willing to accommodate something like that.", "NTA.\n\nYes, it's your mother's home as well as yours, and she should feel free to have guests.  But this isn't really having guests.\n\nYour brother and SIL are asking your mother to babysit their kids all day.  To me, that's not being guests, that's a job.  How often is this happening?  Every day?  I can understand if your SIL has appointments or errands that would be difficult to manage with two small kids in tow, but as a SAHM there is no reason that your mother should be watching her children so often, and not for the whole day.\n\nThe arrangement you and your husband made with your mother involves compensation for her watching your two children after school only.  You aren't \"using\" your mother. Also, watching an 8 year old and an 11 year old is very different from watching toddlers.\n\nYour mother isn't sure she feels comfortable watching 4 kids at once.  That's a big concern. It's also something she needs to address with your brother and SIL.  Your mother is completely within her rights to refuse to watch more children than she feels comfortable watching.\n\nIs there some other reason your brother and SIL think this arrangement is \"unfair?\"  Does your mother make time to visit them in their own house?  \n\nOne last question - is your mother's suite large enough for her to watch two toddlers in?  If not, you certainly have a say in what areas of the house the little ones have access to.  After all, if the house isn't baby-proofed, it's not safe for your brother's & SIL's kids.  Nor is it your responsibility to baby-proof your home because your brother and SIL feel entitled to impose on your mother.", "NTA, this isn't \"showing favorites\" you're literraly making a massive investment and having her essentially live with you. If she's happy with the arrangement, great.\n\nSIL needs to pony up half the costs for all the work you're doing if she expects any of the benefits. This doesn't sound like \"once in a while she needs a hand\" (which would be perfectly reasonable and understandable to expect from family)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're 100% right that SIL's job is to look after her children. What an entitled piece of work...", "NTA. I get your point. I also get your brothers point. He sees the living in babysitter and wants the same for his kids.\n\nMaybe a simple solution would be to pay your mother for babysitting. So you won't help her with her expenses (at least not on paper) but pay her for doing so. So your brother can't say, she is a free babysitter for you. She can say, she has to do her own things, in the time she is not 'working' and if he wants to have her look after his children, she can come to his house for the time she isn't 'booked' by you. But he has to pay as well", "NTA BUT\n\nYTA for telling her she can never babysit your brother's kids. In her suite. \n\nI agree that during her \"nanny hours\" they should not come nor be in your part of the house. That is part of the agreement wherein you are paying her bills, etc. But. That doesn't mean you get to set all the rules for the rest of her time... \n\nIn the other hours, if you mom chooses, she should absolutely have the right to babysit her other grandkids in HER suite.", " What does she need to do all day if she\u2019s a stay at home mom? Like I\u2019m a stay at home mom and I get needing a break. Or wanting a date,but the only person I leave with my kids all day with is my husband if I need to be gone all day. If it\u2019s an emergency sure I\u2019ll leave them with my mom. But I agree with you as a stay at home MOM. With mom being in the title makes my job my kids and my home and my husband", "ESH.  You and your SIL are comingling personal/family matters with what looks like a financial arrangement between you and your mother.  In return for living rent-free in your home, your mom has agreed to supervise/care your two (older) kids.  \n\nYou are making this a business transaction; hence, your SIL is meddling with your business arrangement.  On the other hand, your SIL is making it a personal affair.  What is more, she is taking advantage of your mother by leaving her children there for an entire day at a time.\n\nYour mother made it clear that she is not comfortable caring for all four kids; but she seems willing to help out, if it's necessary. Rather than tell your SIL (or even her own son) how she feels about being saddled with all four children, she is letting you be the bad guy.\n\nYou and your mother need to become clear on exactly what the agreement between the two of is. Then the two of you need to inform your brother and SIL.

Your mom can choose for herself where she wants to invest her time.", "YTA for expecting Mom to watch your kids as the price for her living with you.   Get your nanny back.  No one should be expecting mom to watch their kids.   If Mom wants to thats fine and she can watch the kids at the home of the person who shes watching for.\n\n\nBut noone should be EXPECTING mom to watch their kids.", "YTA. it's your mums house too and so is her decision whether she feels she can cope with 4 kids. you shouldn't be making that decision for her. if your mum decides she can't then she needs to speak to her son. it might be nice if you could arrange a once a week nanny so she can look after her other grandchildren and give her son the same help you get", "YTA", "YTA.

It\u2019s not a lot of work. \n\nTaking the pure emotional aspect of it being your mother out of the equation, and presuming it\u2019s just a tenant or even a nanny, who ever is living there is making out with a great deal. \n\nAnd it\u2019s your mom, their grandmother.

OP is  not taking advantage of her mother, but SIL is. Grandma isn\u2019t a prisoner.

Plus plus, no notice was given so there was no conversation about how to make it work, preparations that needed to be made, or anything like that.\n\nIt honestly sounds like, and you pointed it out, that SIL is treating you house as the new daycare.  Best case scenario, she's overwhelmed now and looking for a chance to breathe and sees your arrangement as a chance to catch her breath.  I wonder if that's the spoilage you see with the 4 year old as SIL feels bad trying to care for the baby and thinks just letting the older one get away with murder is easier/will make them happier.  Worst case scenario, she's trying to pawn her kids off on your mom indefinitely so she can kick her heels back and not worry about them at all but still get to do the cute kid stuff when she wants.\n\nMight be worth checking with your SIL (or brother if you're too amped up to talk to her directly) and see how things are going on with them.

OP\u2019s kids have grandma full time, brother\u2019s kids aren\u2019t even allowed to visit grandma\u2019s home. She is equally the grandmother of both of their kids. She spends 5 days a week with OP\u2019s kids and her occasional days off with brother\u2019s kids, who are not permitted in her home. That\u2019s the issue here. SIL sucks for dropping the kids off, for wanting free childcare, for generally being an ass. OP sucks because only her kids get their grandma and brother\u2019s kids get an occasional extended family member who is working full time in her retirement and does not have time for them and whose home they can\u2019t even visit. OP won reddit over because of the babysitting, but she\u2019s not even close to innocent here. I went NC with my mother for a similar reason tbh. It doesn\u2019t matter if OP is paying her cash, or paying her in housing, she has robbed her niblings of equal time with their grandmother, and even the chance to visit her in her home. The kids aren\u2019t accountants, they are children who know their cousins have a grandma and they don\u2019t. OP could cut back grandmas work hours to 2 days a week and let her grandchildren visit their grandmothers home. She would rather not. That\u2019s a choice.", "My thoughts exactly. No kids here, but I'm an animal-lover with three dogs. I'd like more. In fact, I'd like a whole houseful of pets, but I can't afford it, so I don't have a whole houseful of pets. It's really not that difficult to understand.", "Pawning her spawn off on MIL.", "Having an affair, what else?", "You won\u2019t let her other grandchildren in *her* home and she is busy with your kids 5 days a week\u2026. How do you think the kids will feel when they get older? Some grandkids got to live with grandma, some weren\u2019t allowed to visit. Some have years and years of memories, some have the occasional weekend when she wasn\u2019t too tired from watching the others all week\u2026. You have monopolized all of her time and banned her grandchildren (that aren\u2019t yours) from your home. That is bad. SIL went about it the wrong way, but she\u2019s right. Sad part is that only the kids get to suffer for it. Good job?", "The MIL raised her children. She's earned her senior time. And it's up to her if she wants to babysit for the SAHM or not. Something is telling me she doesn't want to do it but doesn't want to cause a fight with the DIL and Son about it. Especially if the one is a complete spoiled brat.", "The school age thing makes such a difference.  Especially with the older one it's likely much more about getting them some after-school food and making sure they don't burn don't the house and do their homework and pick them up from school.  These are very reasonable things to do as a live-in grandparent.  It's minor babysitting, not being a full time carer.", "Yeah, SIL is no SAHP; she's just unemployed.", "> *Much easier than small kids*.\n\nKids this age could do a lot to *care for grandma*, if she had a sprained ankle or wrist or something else that isn't serious.  I've known many responsible people who were 8 and 11 at the time.\n\nNTA, OP.", "If she\u2019s watching four kids at once, then she\u2019s watching SIL\u2019s kids at the same time as OP\u2019s, during time which is explicitly **not** \u201cher own\u201d.", "Comment stealing bot", "All whilst zoning out and going \u201cuh huh- oh, yeah, uh huh, I get it, definitely.\u201d Etc etc etc", "thats not that bad, a lot of parents would be thrilled to have that much interaction with their kid", "Most states don\u2019t even have a minimum age for babysitting. I\u2019ve seen people hire 12 year olds to babysit infants once they got their Red Cross certificate.", "Wait, she wants it all day everyday? That\u2019s nuts. You pay for that.", "\"Uh-huh. Oh, that sounds cool. Uh-huh. Yeah. Totally. Really? So cool.\"", "IT AIN'T MY KID.\n\nShe just shows up in my house and eats my snacks and calls me auntie. Lil weirdo. I make her weirder and send her back with silly putty and early internet viral videos to play for my sister. You're welcome for He-Man singing 4 Non Blondes for a week straight. Hey, Got any Grapes?", "shoot, even if they ain't my kid singing 4non blondes is kinda tight.", "Ahhhhh, but what a classic. Nyan-cat is the perfect intersection of adorable, ear-worm, and obnoxious if you haven't done that yet.", "[This one.](https://youtu.be/32FB-gYr49Y?si=cLc5-Avbo-VLKnbL)\n\nI'm the chaos sibling.", "It\u2019s not a poor opinion of a job to think that someone who holds that job should actually **do that job**."]}
