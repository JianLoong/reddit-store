It\u2019s been great having her around, but the issue is that my brother (32M) and his wife (SIL) think it\u2019s unfair and showing \u201cfavorites\u201d if my mom only babysits my kids and not theirs.\n\nLast week, SIL literally just dropped off her kids (2 and 4) at my house as soon as my husband I left for work and I only found out through my Ring camera. My husband and I don\u2019t want my brother\u2019s kids at our house because 1) they\u2019re very young and our house is not babyproofed and has many fragile items I know they will try to get into 2) the 4yo is extremely spoiled and his parents never say no or give him consequences so he goes to anyone\u2019s house and has bad behavior 3) my mom only watches my kids for about three hours everyday, but my SIL is dropping off her kids ALL day at MY house even when my kids aren\u2019t being watched.\n\nI talked to my mom and she said she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019s comfortable with watching 4 kids at once but she\u2019ll try if needed and it\u2019s ultimately up to me if my brother\u2019s kids can come over since it\u2019s my house. So I told my brother and SIL no and SIL has been sending me the rudest messages about how I\u2019m turning my kids spoiled and letting them have their grandmother\u2019s favoritism etc etc. Also that I could afford a nanny but I\u2019m choosing to \u201cuse\u201d my mother when she and my brother can\u2019t afford other childcare.

You went to the trouble and expense to set up a nice place for your mom to live so she would not be alone, and you all agreed to a small amount of babysitting\u2014in her shoes, I would insist on contributing this way.

They do need Grandma to watch their kids sometimes, though, like for date nights.  NTA assuming you all are willing to accommodate something like that.", "NTA.\n\nYes, it's your mother's home as well as yours, and she should feel free to have guests.  But this isn't really having guests.\n\nYour brother and SIL are asking your mother to babysit their kids all day.  To me, that's not being guests, that's a job.  How often is this happening?  Every day?  I can understand if your SIL has appointments or errands that would be difficult to manage with two small kids in tow, but as a SAHM there is no reason that your mother should be watching her children so often, and not for the whole day.\n\nThe arrangement you and your husband made with your mother involves compensation for her watching your two children after school only.  You aren't \"using\" your mother. Also, watching an 8 year old and an 11 year old is very different from watching toddlers.\n\nYour mother isn't sure she feels comfortable watching 4 kids at once.  That's a big concern. It's also something she needs to address with your brother and SIL.  Your mother is completely within her rights to refuse to watch more children than she feels comfortable watching.\n\nIs there some other reason your brother and SIL think this arrangement is \"unfair?\"  Does your mother make time to visit them in their own house?  \n\nOne last question - is your mother's suite large enough for her to watch two toddlers in?  If not, you certainly have a say in what areas of the house the little ones have access to.  After all, if the house isn't baby-proofed, it's not safe for your brother's & SIL's kids.  Nor is it your responsibility to baby-proof your home because your brother and SIL feel entitled to impose on your mother.", "NTA, this isn't \"showing favorites\" you're literraly making a massive investment and having her essentially live with you. If she's happy with the arrangement, great.\n\nSIL needs to pony up half the costs for all the work you're doing if she expects any of the benefits. This doesn't sound like \"once in a while she needs a hand\" (which would be perfectly reasonable and understandable to expect from family)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're 100% right that SIL's job is to look after her children. What an entitled piece of work...", "NTA. I get your point. I also get your brothers point. He sees the living in babysitter and wants the same for his kids.\n\nMaybe a simple solution would be to pay your mother for babysitting. So you won't help her with her expenses (at least not on paper) but pay her for doing so. So your brother can't say, she is a free babysitter for you. She can say, she has to do her own things, in the time she is not 'working' and if he wants to have her look after his children, she can come to his house for the time she isn't 'booked' by you. But he has to pay as well", "NTA BUT\n\nYTA for telling her she can never babysit your brother's kids. In her suite. \n\nI agree that during her \"nanny hours\" they should not come nor be in your part of the house. That is part of the agreement wherein you are paying her bills, etc. But. That doesn't mean you get to set all the rules for the rest of her time... \n\nIn the other hours, if you mom chooses, she should absolutely have the right to babysit her other grandkids in HER suite.", " What does she need to do all day if she\u2019s a stay at home mom? Like I\u2019m a stay at home mom and I get needing a break. Or wanting a date,but the only person I leave with my kids all day with is my husband if I need to be gone all day. If it\u2019s an emergency sure I\u2019ll leave them with my mom. But I agree with you as a stay at home MOM. With mom being in the title makes my job my kids and my home and my husband", "ESH.  You and your SIL are comingling personal/family matters with what looks like a financial arrangement between you and your mother.  In return for living rent-free in your home, your mom has agreed to supervise/care your two (older) kids.  \n\nYou are making this a business transaction; hence, your SIL is meddling with your business arrangement.  On the other hand, your SIL is making it a personal affair.  What is more, she is taking advantage of your mother by leaving her children there for an entire day at a time.\n\nYour mother made it clear that she is not comfortable caring for all four kids; but she seems willing to help out, if it's necessary. Rather than tell your SIL (or even her own son) how she feels about being saddled with all four children, she is letting you be the bad guy.\n\nYou and your mother need to become clear on exactly what the agreement between the two of is. Then the two of you need to inform your brother and SIL.

Your mom can choose for herself where she wants to invest her time.", "YTA for expecting Mom to watch your kids as the price for her living with you.   Get your nanny back.  No one should be expecting mom to watch their kids.   If Mom wants to thats fine and she can watch the kids at the home of the person who shes watching for.\n\n\nBut noone should be EXPECTING mom to watch their kids.", "YTA. it's your mums house too and so is her decision whether she feels she can cope with 4 kids. you shouldn't be making that decision for her. if your mum decides she can't then she needs to speak to her son. it might be nice if you could arrange a once a week nanny so she can look after her other grandchildren and give her son the same help you get", "YTA", "YTA.

But if I need time off I\u2019m not just dropping my kids off. I\u2019m giving them to my husband, I\u2019m making arrangements. I\u2019m doing what\u2019s best by my kids which is if I want to go out and do things or I need a break it\u2019s going to be daddy or family but that family member is going to know in advance", "Do you even have a kid or stay at home? Because if you are you can\u2019t just dump your kids", "... Good for you I guess ? This is OP's post tho and we are not judging here what a SAHM should or shouldn't do.", "... like I said. We are not here to judge is SIL is an asshole, or how a SAHM should handle her kids. That's another subject. We are not judging SIL here, but the conflict between OP and her mom.", "This is about the SIL taking advantage", "Mom gave OP the decision if SIL could drop off her kids at OP\u2019s home. It was OP\u2019s decision on weather or not her brothers kids were allowed. That\u2019s what her own mom who\u2019s husband just died, and given a home by OP. Why would mom give OP that option? If she felt so badly about not having visitors. Also SIL threw a tantrum about not having full access to Mom. For childcare. And using the \u201cyou could afford a nanny\u201d aka I was going to abuse free childhood, and you took it away from me."]}
