It\u2019s definitely not for everybody, though it clearly meant something to your mom.\n\nYou are under no obligation to be happy about the proposal or the engagement, ESPECIALLY as she called to talk about that while you were waiting for news about your grandfather. She cannot demand you offer any sort of congratulations or happiness in this situation. Edited", "You have the right to your opinion but think of it this way, the thing that goes through many people\u2019s mind at the hospital while watching family in life or death situations is literally \u201clife is short and I don\u2019t want to be without you\u201d. \n\nYour stepdad probably had that moment and just asked your mom to make it official. \n\nNah.", "INFO \nHow much do you know about this proposal? Was it a big, planned affair?

I get that this feels like something unwanted to you, but you don\u2019t know the interpersonal relationship between them that may mean that this sort of \u201cpromise of commitment\u201d during a hard time might be really good timing for you mom.\n\nHow does SHE feel about it?", "I'm so very sorry for your loss. But NAH.\n\nStress and grief hits everyone differently. I'll bet you a dollar the proposal was more about the legal ramifications of \"what's going to happen to you if something happens to me\" than any overtly romantic gesture. Sometimes, relationships need paperwork. And sometimes it takes something awful to realize that. \n\nGive everyone,  including yourself,  some grace.  \n\nAgain, I'm so sorry about your grandpa", "Based on the little info given, I'm going NAH.  I agree from an outside perspective, his timing looks poor and you have a right to be upset by it.  However, we don't know the private conversations between them, and it sounds like your mom was comforted by the proposal.  You don't have to be happy about the engagement.  You can congratulate your mom if she is happy.", "NAH - but I think your mom should have waited to tell you.\n\nA discussion between a middle-aged unmarried couple about end of life medical decisions could absolutely lead to \"well, should we get married so it's automatic?\" or \"life is short, let's do the thing.\"\n\nI totally get why you're put-off about it, but that's why I think your mom should have waited to bring it up.", "INFO: how did he ask her?", "NAH. Times of stress test relationships. They weren\u2019t having a party; they were waiting for MRI results. It\u2019s a more normal time to propose than you probably think. You\u2019re going through a TON right now. Give yourself some space, feel what you feel, and try not to judge how others react to the stress.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re assholes for getting engaged, whatever. But your mom expecting you to congratulate her two hours after your grandpa died is unrealistic.", "NTA. Why is your mother making your grandfathers illness about herself? Than to blindside her kids. Anyone saying anything else are just rude and inconsiderate parents and family members.", "NTA. Your stepdad sounds like a Grade A moron.", "Info: If he was already your stepdad, how are he and your mom not married? Was he previously married to your dad?", "NTA\n\nWoah......... This is one of the worst times to even think about proposing.\n\nI can't believe your mom doesn't think this is so messed up. I would've shut it down if someone proposed to me in this dire situation. There are other inappropriate times and places to propose marriage (ex. someone else's wedding, someone else's party).\n\nI know the world doesn't stop when your grandfather died, but it's still odd to have this proposal now.", "NTA\n\nI understand your pain, it\u2019s okay to feel upset and hurt. Your stepfather proposed in a very awkward and upsetting situation. As much as i understand your mother\u2019s acceptance, there\u2019s a time and a place for these things. I find it rather insulting to propose during what is seemingly a \u2018family emergency\u2019. \n\nRegardless, i find your feelings valid", "NTA\n\nIf you don't like the man then you don't have to pretend to be okay with it. It's also extremely inappropriate for him to propose under those circumstances.", " NTA. Sounds like Stepdad is a bone head.", "NTA..\n\nIt might have felt like the right moment for your stepdad to propose and it might felt right for your mother to say yes\u2026 But for her to expect you to tell her congratulations? No. Just no.\n\nTime and place. Again, NTA OP.\n\nAnd condolences for your loss\u2026", "NTA...who in the hell during the wait to find out if a man is braindead decides to propose? And who in their right mind being related to that potentially dead man would actually accept a proposal in that moment? Clearly this was not an appropriate time to ask or answer even if your mom really wants to marry him. \n\nMaking decisions while undergoing trauma is just a recipe for disaster. Red flags everywhere\ud83d\udea9", "That\u2019s incredibly tacky. NTA", "I'm so sorry for your loss.  NTA.  I don't know how he could have picked a more inappropriate moment to propose.  If I was your mom I would have told him to ask me later, unless my answer was no.", "NTA\n\nSorry for your loss.", "That's bad timing on his part. Seriously. Entirely inconsiderate and a red flag in my book.\n\nThat being said, she is your mother and you kids SHOULD have a say in who she marries for a few more years as you'd be spending time with them.\n\nAll and all, NTA. And my condolences.", "NTA. I thought maybe they didn\u2019t know but he proposed at the hospital while waiting for an MRI for your Grandfather?!! That timing is about as bad as it gets. I have no idea what they were thinking. I\u2019m so sorry your Grandpa died and then\u2026this happened. I hope your life immediately gets better OP! Wishing you the best!", "The only asshole here is your stepdad.  He should know better than to propose during such a difficult time.\n\nNAH except for him.", "stepdad is a boss. \ud83e\udd23", "Well, that was a classy move.\n\nIf I had proposed to my partner the day her dad died, I would quickly have been wearing several kitchen knives and maybe a lump hammer.\n\nThere must surely have been bad blood between your mother and her father. I cannot see any circumstance, in my life at least, where this kind of behaviour would have been deemed worthy of congratulations.\n\nThe good thing though, if that is the word, is that your mother's partner has just revealed the kind of person he is, if you were in any doubt at all. The bad thing is that it also reveals something about your mother.\n\nNTA at all and I would feel every bit as upset about it as you and your sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was under the impression that they were never getting married.", "I agree with your take. I could definitely see how an older couple may reach this agreement at this point in time. The whole reality of end of life care and how short life is could really hit you like a ton of bricks. And if you\u2019ve been together a long time, it makes sense to be like \u201cfuck, we need to make this official so this burden doesn\u2019t fall on our kids when we\u2019re in their shoes\u201d \n\nBut I also agree it\u2019s in bad taste to tell the kids immediately. It makes the people involved look calloused and self absorbed.", "I also think this is important because some proposals are simple statements, not huge ecstatic events. If OPs mom and stepdad were just talking about deep stuff, like issues of life and death, it is easy to make a jump to \"I want you by my side in the end, should we make this official and get married?\" I can picture a conversation like that and while it would technically be a proposal, it wouldn't necessarily be a huge celebratory event. Still, I don't think OP is TA based on what we know. I also don't think the mom should expect a congrats at this time. But maybe she just felt very comforted by the proposal at a moment where she was surrounded by sadness and stress.", "I dont know. I was under the impression that they were never getting married.", "they were dating but he and his kids were living with us so everyone just accepted each other as step siblings and step parents.", "He might smell an inheritance.", "I know two couples who did not plan to get married but ended up getting engaged in hospitals.  Second marriages for both couples, and still happy years later. When placed in a situation that reminds you the legal status of your relationship can determine whether you can be with your loved one in a crisis, the piece of paper can suddenly seem a lot more important.", "Then communicate that to your mom instead of making a passive-aggressive comment about her being an adult. You reacted without having all of the information and likely added to her emotions during what's already a difficult time.", "I was debating N T A or N A H, but I\u2019ll go NTA, but because your mom expected a congratulations, not your step-dad proposing. I don\u2019t think he did a tasteless proposal today (though I could be wrong, some people are messed up).", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and that you have to live with a stepdad and mom who can\u2019t read a room.", "NTA, I'll be honest that's kinda... inappropriate??\n\n Idk, if one of my family members was going through a life or death situation and I was proposed to during that time, I would absolutely say \"wtf, this is not the time.\" \n\nBut that's just me, maybe your mom and step-dad had a \"life flashing before their eyes\" moment and decided they needed to be committed to each other forever.\n\nHave an honest discussion with your mom about everything. Because expecting a congratulations from you after your grandpa passed was a little heartless of her.", "Slight YTA: you were being passive aggressive AF, and your response (as you put it) would make it seem that you just straight up don\u2019t approve of their relationship. Yes your grandfather was dying, but situations like that can cause people to react in various ways. In your Step-dad\u2019s case, that likely came with a sudden realization of the fragility of life, how much he loves your mother, and how he can\u2019t envision a future where they aren\u2019t married.", "NTA. They honestly both suck. His proposal was at a terrible time. She could have kept it to herself.\nI imagine this will be the same response everyone else gave her too. It\u2019s very selfish of both of them", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe stepdad could be this stupid.

I'm a wedding officiate and my cousin and his fiancee asked me to marry them at the hospital while we were waiting on one of our close relatives to pass.

Or even the grandfather feeling good about his daughter getting married, even if he won\u2019t get to see it (old school, but he\u2019s of that generation). All speculation, but worth it for OP to consider that fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t hijack the situation out of spite or unfeeling.", "Her grandfather is actively dying\u2026", "That\u2019s why I said slight.", "OP is also going through a difficult time having just lost their grandad. Mom can get engaged but expecting anyone to congratulate her or listen to explanations about her engagement the day the grandad died is not reasonable. For most of the family, the day is probably about losing grandad, dealing with the shock and grief plus rallying around the grandmother (one would hope). And that's before the practical considerations are taken into account. Mom's engagement and getting more information on it is the least of anyone's worries.", "So why on earth would this proposal be appropriate? Let alone appropriate to share. This is tacky AF. Like proposing at someone\u2019s wedding, only a lot worse. She\u2019s grieving, clearly she is not going to celebrate the news. Anyone with an ounce of common sense or decorum would hold off on announcing until after the funeral", "OP is not a child. Mom doesn't seem to be expecting excitement but OP's reaction was condescending."]}
