I would like to commend you on her sports choice both for self defense and the emotional outlet it brings.", "NTA.  She was *clearly* better off in your home than his, and not just because of your brother's apparent sexism lmfao", "NTA \n\nYep, that was definitely a low blow, but what he said was far worse. Not only to be so dismissive of your heroic effort to save your niece when he failed, but, much worse, **saying you failed implies he\u2019s ashamed of who his daughter has become**. And that\u2019s unforgivable.", "NTA - People in glass houses et al.\n\nSeriously he calls you a failure for something that is, in no way, a failure.

You were doing the best you could with how you felt at the time. He should be more grateful to you so she didn\u2019t have to go into the foster care system. However, he\u2019s had many years in a place where manners and appreciation are signs of weakness and may stil be adjusting to the outside world. Would have been better if you had kept it out of the conversation but I couldn\u2019t fault you considering how long you\u2019ve taken care of her. You are more of a father to her than he is obviously.", "NTA\n\nI mean he pretty much fed you the line by saying you failed as an uncle.

Furthermore, he said a sexist comment that women should not do boxing, she's taught to protect herself and discipline from boxing. You're winning all round and he doesn't deserve you or her", "Since your mom has something to say, how come she didn\u2019t raise her granddaughter herself?", "NTA, although throwing his prison sentence back in his face was sort of unnecessary. The fact is, his daughter needed a parent and you stepped up. You did the job and made the decisions you thought were best at the time, like any parent would. He doesn't get to question and nitpick you retroactively. He should be grateful that his daughter didn't have to grow up in foster care because of his poor choices. \n\nMore importantly, he doesn't get to just step back into the parent role like he'd never been away. He doesn't even really know his daughter, who is now a young woman. That realization must have stung, but that's his problem, not yours. Good job holding that boundary for your niece.", "Info: Did you have this conversation in front of your daughter/niece?", "Soft YTA. Yeah, that comment from you wasn\u2019t necessary. You should just talk about how sexist that comment is, how good it\u2019s been for her, and focus on that. Just insulting him doesn\u2019t prove to him that letting her box was a good idea. Plus, just point out all the amazing things youve done as an uncle. Your niece sounds lucky to have you", "ESH. He is clearly a misogynist and you\u2019re right, he wasn\u2019t there to make the choices. \n\nYou\u2019re the asshole for the way you responded to him. You must know he\u2019s deeply regretful because he missed out on all that time. He obviously didn\u2019t commit the crimes thinking he\u2019d go to jail. He just should have considered that might be a possibility and choose not to do it.", "I see nothing wrong with stating the fact and did he ever even thank you for stepping up while he was in prison and sorry that\u2019s passive aggression from your mom tbh and nothing is wrong with your niece doing a sport that she enjoys. Your niece wanted to do it and you were willing to let her do it. Good on you", "Not dick move. Accurate. Accountability.

And he also didn't keep in touch with her and know what was happening in her life. He had not right to bring his bullshit sexist judgment into your home and call you a failure at doing HIS job. You gave your niece the ability to protect herself, to feel strong and independent and to channel her anger and frustration in a positive way. You mom needs to stay out of this. Her son made mistakes and is still making mistakes and he needs to be accountable for his words, just as much as his actions. He has no right to criticize her or you.", "NTA! Dude! That reply was spot on. Seriously, he has no ground to stand on. You stepped up when he went to prison and he had the audacity to say anything other than thank you. That\u2019s a huge kiss my a**! Also, girls have every right to box. You\u2019re teaching her to be strong and protect herself. That\u2019s another positive in your corner.", "Nta. I'd be petty af and bring it up and remind him he missed out on his kid.", "NTA", "NTA he could have had a say, but he chose to go to jail, so lost his say.

You raised this man's child - and btw, based on that comment, I think she got a good deal holy crap - and he has nothing but criticism for you.\n\nYeah your comment was harsh af, but your family is making you apologize bc they want you to be the bigger person.

Seriously.  \n\n\nIt was not a dick move, it was a truth he needs to come to grips with.

He ruined his relationship with his daughter because he wanted to play criminal. Surprise surprise usually these people get caught and go to jail. That\u2019s the gamble with the criminal lifestyle. He shouldn\u2019t be questioning any decisions you made regarding her unless she\u2019s obviously acting out or something else is wrong. She\u2019s a normal girl with her own hobbies, god forbid they aren\u2019t the typical feminine ones. You would have thought they would have beat the sexist out of him in jail. So wrong to be upset about BOXING. Should be glad she knows how to defend herself", "NTA.. his actions and choices took her away from him. He should be full of gratitude and respect for you for stepping up and caring for her.  It's probably a huge chunk of jealousy coming out from him.", "NTA, you where deciding what was right for the child at the time.", "NTA like everyone here has said.\n\nBut also, holy shit. How many guys was he in prison with, that were there for being awful to women? He would have had a front row seat to some of the hideous chat that can go on when men talk about things they would do/have done/etc. And he still doesn't want his only daughter to be able to defend herself? Fucking hell. \n\nSounds like you did a really good job, OP. Both in raising her, and in having her back.", "NTA. whats wrong with some boxing? as long it is not on professional brain damage level, there is nothing wrong with being able to defend one self", "I mean, it's the truth.\n\nLook, his actions and crimes were **avoidable.** This isn't some sort of inevitability, like he didn't just go to the convenience store for milk one day and oopsiedoodle look, he tripped into an eleven year sentence for identity theft and forgery. It doesn't work that way.\n\nHe doesn't get to judge how you raised his daughter when she is happy and vibrant, and the only \"criticism\" he can make is that \"girls shouldn't learn boxing.\" If anything, he was around enough of the reffuse of society to know a sufficiently able woman knowing how to defend herself is a useful skill if not simply a fun hobby or even a possible athletic future...though I suppose his crimes would have been minsec with the other white collar criminals. Maybe.\n\nEither way, your mother should shut up.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You did go nuclear, but he really, really deserved to hear it.  I might have gone a little lighter with the same outcome.  \u201cI don\u2019t think you are equipped to judge my parenting or what was right for her because you chose crime over your child in essence abandoning her.  I have in fact been a great parent and have given her a way to defend herself against criminals should she be threatened.\u201d", "NTA Your niece was better off not being raised by a sexist asshole.", "It wasn't a dick move to say that; your brother lost all rights on how his daughter was raised when he went to prison.\n\nNTA", "Call me now", "ESH.\n\nYou shouldn't have said it, but it is entirely understandable why you did.  He should have kept his mouth shut after you took care of his kid for 11 years (and also for his misogynistic nonsense).", "> He then said girls shouldn't do boxing\n\nWell men shouldn\u2019t commit major crimes that get prison time and miss more than half their kid\u2019s life, but here we are.\n\nYour niece is lucky to have a you, her life probably would have been significantly worse if her worthless dad had stayed in it. You\u2019re over here picking up his slack for over a decade and that\u2019s his thanks?", "NTA, fuck him.\n\nI have an 18 year old step daughter since she was 9 and I've had to make lots of choices with her over the years. Her \"dad\" is so uninvolved it's ludicrous and if he dared to try and judge my parenting choices (that my daughter is perfectly happy with) I'd tell him to go fuck himself too.\n\nYour brother needs to grow up and accept that he made bad decisions, and those decisions had consequences not just for him but for his daughter.\n\nHe should be on his knees thanking you for taking care of his offspring.", "NTA \n\n>and that I had failed as an uncle\n\nSo you failed as an uncle because you support your niece's *very valid and normal* interests....? Yeah, sure. With his sexist view on things I kinda already prefer he wasn't there to raise her. He asked for your comeback.", "Nah, you're fine.\n\nNTA", "This post reminds me of something my brother told me years ago. He was in the military and obviously gone for periods of time. At that time, the military required all soldiers returning home from a deployment to attend a type of re-acclimation class. One thing from the class that he said really 'hit home' was that a lot of things happened while you were gone. They are over and done with and you can not expect an accounting of all those things or think it is okay to bring them up. For example, you see a new faucet in the bathroom. Do not question why, how much, who installed, etc. because to the folks at home that was something done probably months ago that, to them, is over and done with. And bringing it up can make them feel like they did something wrong or that you need to validate their choices.\n\nAnyways, that lesson is what came to mind with this post. How OP raised his niece and what activities he let her participate in is 'old news' (even if she is still doing them). Rehashing and asking for the reasoning and providing an opinion is not acceptable.", "Agreed.. Besides he didn't hold his tongue... Why should you have to hold yours?", "It\u2019s commitment to her physical fitness, and she can defend herself in adverse situations. Her father criticising her chosen activity is the last thing he\u2019s in a position to do.", "Ntm, while brother was in jail, I wonder how many people he met in there that did harm to women and children that couldn't defend themselves? He should be glad that his daughter is able to defend herself. \n\nNTA, OP could remind his brother that he raised his daughter to be a proud upstanding person to society that can kick ass when needed.", "OP\u2019s brother deserved it not only because of the lack of gratitude for the sacrifices OP made to raise his niece instead of sending her into the system, but also for the extremely sexist comments that girls shouldn\u2019t box.

He should be grateful to op. Why isnt he an ah?", "All of this!! \n\nThe comment was entirely unnecessary and really unrelated to the essence of the situation.  \n\nHe made a mistake, but has done his time. How long will you continue to throw it in his face? Sounds like he is trying to reconnect with his daughter. You could be supportive and help him understand who she is now.", "Then NTA/minor Y T A. I think you took it a little too far but as long as it wasn't in front of her it's not that big of a deal.
