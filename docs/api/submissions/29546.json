At that time, the military required all soldiers returning home from a deployment to attend a type of re-acclimation class.

They are over and done with and you can not expect an accounting of all those things or think it is okay to bring them up. For example, you see a new faucet in the bathroom. Do not question why, how much, who installed, etc. because to the folks at home that was something done probably months ago that, to them, is over and done with.

And now he should be glad that someone from his family could step up to the task and do it properly. \n\nMany other kids get sent into a system that you don't want your child in. His choices have had a very real impact on the life of his daughter. He his the one who failed at everything. And you did not.", "OP is NTA. He should have responded \"Sorry bro, I think you misspoke. I think what your meant to say was 'Thank you for raising my daughter since I was a deadbeat dad.'\"", "The audacity. \n\nHe lost 11 years of his daughter\u2019s life due to his selfish decisions and when he gets out, instead of cherishing the time he now has, he says YOU FAILED!?\n\nYour brother sucks and so does your mother.", "NTA - even aside from his retrograde views on what women can do, telling you that you failed as an uncle when he wasn't even around is a massive insult", "NTA.\nYou raised his daughter for 11 years because he's a criminal. He has no right to say anything about the activities you paid to have your niece participate in.\nHe should be thanking you daily for taking his daughter in. You were basically her father for the time he was in prison.\nIf your brother is mad at anyone, he should only be mad at himself.", "NTA- he shouldn\u2019t have committed fraud and should have been there for his kid. He should be grateful that his family was so involved in his child\u2019s life", "NTA", "NTA - hard truths must be faced.  You've been more of a father to her than he has. I'm also gonna bet that it wasn't forced upon her and that she's doing it (especially as she's now an adult) by choice and out of enjoyment.  \n\nHe's probably got some misguided views about what women should and shouldn't do owing to missing 11 years of society, but regardless of that, she's a free woman.  Was your comment harsh, sure was but rather than be a good parent, he was more interested in easy money, and he paid a price for it.", "ESH\n\nYes your brother was being an asshole and his comments were out of pocket, but there was no need to hurt him like that. You immediately went to the thing you knew would cause him the most amount of pain. When you hop to the single sentence that maximizes pain instantly you also suck.", "NTA it's always bizarre for me how people say offensive things to someone else, and then get enraged when you say something offensive right back lol", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoxing is such a great sport for any young person, fair play to you for taking on this massive responsibility. You sound like you're doing an amazing job.", "NTA- You were absolutely correct, and he should be thankful that his daughter had someone looking after her so well and prepared her to be able to look after herself. He made his choice not to be around.", "NTA - he failed as a dad where you didn\u2019t, and his reaction to her taking boxing classes screams that it was better for everyone involved", "He said you \"failed as an uncle\" for that? I feel like your brother is trying to undermine you little by little so he can sneak back in as \"the real dad\". It's possible your mother agrees with that plan.\n\nAnyway, NTA.", "NTA\n\nI'm petty so I'm all about throwing it to their faces when they need some \"reminding\"!", "NTA sounds like be wouldn't have made good choices for her either way, just sexist ones. You did good.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. He's a deadbeat and boxing is an awesome thing for young women to do.", "I\u2019m relieved she had you as her uncle. I was excluded from sports because it was the 80s but I would have been the golden girl of the football team had I just been allowed to play. I was huge with 7 brothers. I would have been great. The coach even looked at me with sadness in our health class. \n\nMy point is that if he wasn\u2019t in prison he would have been the 1980s to your daughter. Bad news there. Nta", "NTA \n\nThis wasn\u2019t \u201cI disagree with letting my daughter box\u201d which has its own much lighter issues that could have been a discussion about letting her do what she wishes and encouraging activities she enjoys.  This was \u201cyou failed her as an uncle\u201d. What was the point of that?  Trying to reclaim some sense of fatherhood by finding whatever little \u201cflaw\u201d you can with how your brother raised your kid for you?\n\nHe came in wanting to drop bombs and then whined when it got thrown back at him.  Seems like he had an awful long time to learn humility, but instead has chosen self-righteousness as the path to dealing with his mistakes.", "**NTA**\n\nYou are NTA at all here. You did your best, you made choices as best you could, they were your choices to make. Your brother walking into your lives and then belitteling your decisions in parenting his daugter is a massive AH move. You were right to check him harshly and remind him that the reason this was your choice in the first place was his actions.", "NTA reality is painful sometimes...", "NTA\n\nYou let your niece learn self-defense, gave her an outlet, and let her keep up with her physical health. I'd say you're doing pretty well.\n\nMy 72-year-old dad boxes for Parkinsons, my dude. Boxing can be for anyone.", "NTA, no sympathy for people who commit crimes like that. Identity theft has ruined lives for thousands of victims. He has no right to complain that his daughter is participating in a sport that is enriching and a great form of exercise.", "\"Girl's shouldn't do boxing\"\n\nRemember that time Holly Holm knocked out Ronda Rousey with a single kick? I still remember all the big \"tough\" guys saying \"I could have done that.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing by allowing her to do what she wanted. If he planned on raising her with the \u201cgirls can\u2019t do that\u201d mentality then Im really glad you did instead.", "NTA. You were there for your niece. He doesn't get to complain since he wasn't. I love boxing and wished we had the money as a kid for me to train. She knows how to protect herself which is very important. He should be saying thank you.", "NTA-He had it coming. Fuck him,he failed her as a father.", "Yta.", "NTA. Fuck his sexist views and fuck him being ungrateful after you raised his child to the best of your ability after he got himself thrown in prison.", "Nta, you raised his daughter. He's mad you did a good job without him. That she is doing good without him. He didn't get the damsel in de-stress he probably pictured once he got out.", "NTA", "Let\u2019s not forget his extremely misogynistic comment.  He should be thrilled his daughter knows how to box, she can protect herself, it\u2019s great exercise, keeping her fit and is amazing for self confidence. All of these are things a young woman needs to help make her way into this world.", "OP is NTA. It was his bothers own fault he didn't get to raise his daughter. And it sounds like his daughter was better off with OP either way, who let her choose her own hobbies.\n\nAlso brother is an AH for sexist bullshit like *\"girls shouldn't be boxing\"*. OP was a better parental figure than her own father. And well done OP, btw. I am sure your niece is glad you had and still have her back!", "View must be nice from that glass house of his tho.", "She doesn\u2019t spar or compete in boxing.\n\nShe has started sparring in Taekwondo but it\u2019s no contact, no blows to the head.", "nah, brother is the one that said he failed as an uncle over letting her do boxing, brother made it about OP, so OP fired back.", "He's expressed interest in and asked her about her grades but not hobbies.", "Nope, hard disagree. Brother is the asshole and the comment was super necessary, assholes dont get told how shitty they are often enough.\nBrother sucks and op did the right thing.", ">He obviously didn\u2019t commit the crimes thinking he\u2019d go to jail. \n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nWhat a defense of fraud and cruelty. \n\nBetter YOU and the brother didn't raise this child.", "My niece has never competed though - only training at the boxing gym without sparring. No idea how she could get any brain injury when she's never been punched in the head.\n\nShe has recently started sparring in Taekwondo but that isn\u2019t full contact and doesn\u2019t involve strikes to the head, so no brain injuries.", "I agree. I did some boxing as a young woman for the reasons you mentioned. It helped me a lot. I also did a lot of other sports. Children should be able to do whatever sport they like.", "Absolutely!!! My youngest daughter is 21 and she's been a kickboxer since she was 12. She still goes to training herself and also trains the younger kids. When she's not kickboxing she's at the gym, usually kicking my ass round it \ud83d\ude02. We originally took her to help with self confidence and self defence with discipline as she was getting bullied at school. It was the best thing we ever did for her.", "They've been manufacturing pink boxing gloves for years now, OP's jailbird brother can stuff it.", "Boxing was a life-saver for me and my kids after our separation from their mother 22 years ago. It's still a very important part of our lives.", ">extremely misogynistic comment\n\nMisogny is the hatred and/or contempt of women.\n\nWhat was misognystic about OP's brothers response?", "Why? The post demonstrates the result of repaying unkindness with unkindness. He could have instead pointed out that stereotyped roles are disappearing and that as result of the training his daughter can likely defend herself better than most women and possibly most men. A significant asset in today\u2019s world.", "Yeah what I said.", "If he just would stop trying to throw bolders out of his glasswalls. That would be nice.", "As a parent myself i find it really strange that he didnt show interest in her hobbies. \nIf i was somehow separated from my daughters for so long i would want to know their interest and hobbies and just what keeps them busy. Grades are a part of that, but you dont know a person by knowing their grades.\n\nDefinitely NTA. I mean stepping up and taking care of her in his stead already makes you not TA. And anyone would get angry by his nerve to now say you did it wrong.\nHe should be emberrased and freaking grateful to you.", "I\u2019m not abdicating the father of responsibility. He\u2019s obviously shitty. This guy is just also an asshole. Hence both of them are assholes", "Tbh i did that in hs, and mostly those are just cardio workouts that teach you to punch, but those aren't really the complete art of boxing because sparring teaches you how to strategize.", "Huh. I guess that\u2019s not what I think of when I think of someone doing 8 years of boxing but fair enough.", "\"girls shouldn't do boxing\"\n\nWhat about \"girls/women shouldn't do x\" is not misogynistic?", "He expects her to stay in her place and to not be included in what deems more 'masculine' activities like boxing against her wishes.", "If you think women shouldn't do \"x\" because its masculine, congrats you're a misogynist.", "\"I'm not homophobic, I'm not scared of gay people\"\n\nMaybe look up connotation vs denotation sometime.  It will help you not look foolish.", "Are you for real?", "learn what words are.", "OP was attacked and he defended himself. \n\nThat\u2019s not \u201crepaying unkindness with unkindness.\u201d He *correctly* pointed out that his brother is in no position to criticize the person who stepped up and raised his child.", "The result of repaying unkindness with unkindness was OP misogynist bro running to *mommy* to accuse OP of being rude with him when \"poor him, how OP dare to throw in his face he was rightfully in prison?\".\n\nOP bro didn't recognize that yes it was his fault to end on prison and being unable to raise his child and think his daughter is a girl and capable of doing boxing. \n\nOP NTA but doesn't sound like your brother is a good influence for his daughter (maybe with some therapy it could work).", "> the result of repaying unkindness with unkindness.\n\nno this is the result of repaying kindness with unkindness.

And as a family, they all need to understand what the other person has been going through during this time. Dad needs to understand time did not stop while he was in prison. He needs to learn who his daughter is a person. Uncle and daughter need to understand what dad went through in prison. The mentality in prison is far different than on the outside. \n\nHonestly, they would all benefit from some counseling. They are in a uniquely difficult situation.
