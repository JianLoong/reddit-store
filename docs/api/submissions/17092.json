For some reference her family aren\u2019t my favorite people in the world. I like her mom but her aunts and uncles are super rude and mean and I don\u2019t like being around them. Well when we were on the beach and about to leave a older guy 60-70 years old stands up in front of us and starts taking pictures of my girlfriend. This is creepy and not only that but she changed into no clothes and covered herself with a big blanket when she came back from the restroom. I asked what he was doing and her aunt and uncle were laughing at it and he was sitting maybe 10 feet in front of use so I\u2019m not sure if he knew she was nude underneath or not. I asked if he was ok then he started taking pictures of my girlfriends sister who is 12 so I stand up and walk next to him and ask if he was ok and why he was taking pictures of us and I wanted to make sure he was maybe not taking pictures of himself and we misunderstood. When I confronted him he just walked away with his stuff and my Aunt and Uncle said I was an asshole for confronting an old man when it\u2019s not a big deal and i\u2019m \u201cto grown to be doing that\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m big for my age\u201d.
