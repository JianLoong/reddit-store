She wanted to get long acrylics done like she sees a lot of other girls wearing.\n\nI am going to be honest and say that I think acrylic nails are a waste of money when press-ons are much cheaper and can look just as good when done properly, even though they don't last quite as long. I wear press ons pretty regularly, which she knows.\n\nWhen she asked if I would take her I said no, and explained my reasoning. I told her that she could look online or I'd take her to ulta and get her press ons that I'd show her how to do. Since that sounds cheap, and because it isn't about the dollar amount, it's about where the money is going, I told her I would try and get her a hair appointment and she could get something fancy done. \n\nMy daughter objected - saying that nobody gets press ons done and that press ons don't look good. Admittedly, I felt hurt as I think I do pretty good on my nails. I told her that she can take my offer or leave it, but she won't be disrespectful. She continued to complain about how she'd be made fun of for having press ons and not the real thing. I told her if she got her own money I'd take her to the salon but I am not paying for something I feel is a waste of money.\n\nMy husband says I'm being too harsh, and that acrylics are a status symbol for girls now. I said that she's 14, she doesn't need a symbol of her status. He pointed out that we could afford a trip to the nail salon. I agreed, but reiterated that it isn't about the dollar amount, it's about the worth. My husband grumbled for a bit and now they are both unhappy with me.

It's not about the amount spent, but what you want isn't worth the value-- how does this make sense especially to a teen who wants the acrylics and not the hair appointment. At that point it seems like you want to control her more than say no. She isn't trying to insult you by not wanting press on nails, but if she has seen one girl teased for press on nails, she is going to be reluctant to compromise here. She is asking for a Christmas present, not a year long commitment. You can say no, but trying to compromise for something that is similar and what you want rather than what she asked for without more reasons than \"this is how I do it\" feels more like control and judgment of what she values than you actually listening to what she wants.", "YTA. She wants it for Christmas. A $60 present. I agree with hubby. Don't you remember being her age and absolutely wanted a (fill in blank)? Do it for her self-esteem boost, not with press ons.

Admittedly, I felt hurt as I think I do pretty good on my nails.\n\nHow hurt do you think your daughter feels because her own mom isn't valuing her wants? She doesn't want press ons. She doesn't want some half-hearted promise to *try* and get a hair appointment. Which is such a cop out by the way.

A gift is meant to be a special treat for someone. If you wanted to get her something else, that is fine, but there is nothing more inherently \u201cworthy\u201d about the gifts you have deemed acceptable vs acrylics, so why do you have to choose this hill to die on? \n\nYTA mostly bc you are arbitrarily imposing your views on your kid and sucking the joy out of life. You can opt to get her a different gift without having a whole drag out about why you refuse to get this particular gift. \n\nAlso your kid rightfully noted that she\u2019d probably get made fun of for wearing press ons. You don\u2019t have to let that get to you, bc what do you care what 14 year olds think is cool? She cares bc she is 14.

You told her the only Christmas presents she get is what you like not what she want for yourself.", ">I said that she's 14, she doesn't need a symbol of her status\n\nThis seems like a pretty removed sentence from what a 14 year old experiences.  \"Status,\" at least broadly, exists at school and in peer groups at 14.\n\nThe thing is, you've not banned her from getting them done, just that she does it with her own pocket money.  So you're not being hugely unfair here even if you are playing the partental \"I don't see the value card\" which is a regular disconnect between generations.\n\n\"I don't see why they have to waste their money and time listening to that racket!\"  1940s parents talking about their kids (your parents) listening to Hendrix, The Who, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones etc...\n\nSooo... yes, you are being THAT parent.

Watching someone work artistically and carefully on something pretty just for you. It\u2019s special. Yes, she could have decent looking nails with press-one, but that\u2019s not the only fun part. That\u2019s why salons are more expensive.", "YTA\n\nIf you had declined because acrylics are damaging. You might have a case. However, your daughter thinks press ons are tacky trash. She is correct. This is more about your ego than your daughter\u2019s happiness.", "The problem with acrylics is you have to keep doing them. So who will be paying for fills and fixes? If it\u2019s a one time deal she\u2019s bound for disappointment after a few weeks, but sometimes kids just need to learn.", "YTA This is like only allowing her to buy the clothes *you* like and thinking it's \"disrespectful\" of her to like anything else. It's ridiculously self centered.\n\nHer Christmas gift should be for *her*. Not for you.", "YTA. Have I seen press on that looks amazing, of course I have, but she\u2019s specifically asking for acrylics. Are acrylic nails worth the money? Yeah, I believe they are to people who enjoy wearing them. They are the same as fake eye lashes, makeup, or any other body enhancements people choose to use/wear. The point isn\u2019t really about something being worth the money, it\u2019s about feeling good about yourself and liking the way something looks on you. \n\nDo you always exclusively buy her gifts that make economical since?  This isn\u2019t a gift for you, it\u2019s for your daughter. It\u2019s about what she\u2019s wants as HER gift.", "Getting her nails done as a Christmas gift and you said no? YTA\n\n\nI can understand if she wanted to get acrylics done and continue to get them done, it gets very expensive.  But as a one time thing, you\u2019re being too harsh. You should have given her the option to get her nails done for Christmas, but if she continues to want acrylics you\u2019d just be buying her press ons.", "YTA. \n\nNot for not letting your daughter get acrylics but how you have handled it. Frankly, it\u2019s rude to tell someone that a gift they want is a waste of money. Your opinion doesn\u2019t matter, hers does. You just told your daughter that her wants don\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t coincide with your perceived \u201cvalue\u201d of it. \n\nThere are so many other reasons to say no. First and foremost is the health of her nails. If done incorrectly, acrylics can be hell on the nail bed. Second, acrylics aren\u2019t just a one-time thing. Letting them grow out leads to breakage and more possible damage to the nail bed. Acrylics either have to be professionally removed or maintained every 10-18 days. \n\nThere are also many alternatives between acrylics and press-ons. Gel nail polish is great - it\u2019s long lasting and sturdy. Dip is also a great option. It has the sturdiness of acrylic while being a lot more healthy for the nails. And if she wants a little length on it, tips can be applied for dip. Frankly, press ons DO NOT compare. At all. It\u2019s such a hassle to deal with it yourself. You have to put in the same amount of work (sometimes more as you get used to it) to remove and replace press ons. And they don\u2019t last nearly as long.\n\nTake it from someone who has had fake nails since she was 14 (30 now), they can absolutely be worthwhile. During Covid, I spent an average of 2 hours every 10 days replacing my at-home press/glue ons and often had to replace 1-3 before each changeout. And I was only working an office job - nothing hard on the hands. Acrylics don\u2019t \u201calways\u201d kill the nails - my nails are naturally garbage and that\u2019s why I got fakes. It stopped frequent breaks that were so far into the nail bed I had to stop using that finger. In my last 20\u2019s, I began to have issues with my acrylics not sticking to my nails. So I switched to dip. Haven\u2019t needed tips for my nails in almost a year, the dip has been able to be put on my real nail. This is the healthiest nail growth I have EVER had.", "I took my granddaughter to get her first acrylics at 11. Five minutes after getting home, she cracked one closing the bathroom door and had to ask for help zipping her pants...that set lasted a week before she soaked them off. I took her for her second set right before the start of eighth grade. That set lasted through her first volleyball practice before she soaked them off!\n\nWere those trips to the salon a \"waste\" of money? I count it as money well spent! I got to admire her her nails, laugh with her about the \"stupid\" nails, and gently tease her about having to zip an 11 year olds jeans for her! But you know what the best thing I got to do was...I got to share some very special bonding time with her! \n\nDid I know that realistically, those nails were never going to last; of course I did. I've \"tried on\" acrylics myself a few times. But sometimes it really is about the experience and the time spent together, and less about what we, as \"adults\" know what we think is the \"better\" thing to do. \n\nSpend time with your daughter, sometimes doing the things she wants to do, even if you don't necessarily see the value in it.

If you think it's not a big deal, then let me just tell you a little cautionary tale from my own early teen years. I was at the mall with my mom and dad and I was around your daughter's age. I was maybe 15. It was before the era of acrylics, but there was a nail salon in the mall doing $15 manicures. I was so excited because I'd never had that experience before. I ran to find my parents and I was SO happy. My dad flat out said no and yelled at me for wanting to waste money when I could paint my nails at home. I'm now 30. I've had my nails done with gel, acrylic, dip, you name it and I've done it. I've gotten my nails done more times than I can count. Let me tell you, to this day I remember how hurt I felt that day and the disappointment in my dad never faded over the years. I will never forget that day when I ran to him so happily only for him to decide that my happiness wasn't worth $15 to him. Let that sink in OP...just let that sink in and let her have it.

I used to do it, but my tech left our podunk town and I have no other options other than to do them myself, which is too much of a bother for me.  Part of why I loved getting my nails done was talking to my tech.  We had a ton in common and it was so nice just doing something just for myself and enjoying the company of someone else.

And maybe she will hate the nails and never want them again. Or maybe she will love them and they'll build some self esteem for her and she'll feel good about herself. Then you can help her budget whatever allowance she gets or whatever she can earn doing chores so that she can save to afford her fills and new polish. \n\nRight now, YTA. You don't get to decide what something is worth to her.", "YTA, you admitted you can afford it and there\u2019s a difference between going regularly and getting them done once as a present.

If you said it\u2019s damaging I could totally see your point but offering to get her hair done when saying nails are to expensive doesn\u2019t make much sense, I mean depending on what you do hair can be expensive, like hundreds of dollars expensive so the money argument isn\u2019t a good one.", "Soft YTA for reasoning. 14 is hard as it is.

They last upwards of 2 weeks, same as acrylics, and look just as good (if not better) That said, that trip to the nail salon is a rite of passage to some girls. Let her have the trip, but talk to her first about what to expect. That they only look good for about 2 weeks and then she either has to pay for the upkeep or take them off. The best advise I ever got as a parent is that you have to let your kids make their own mistakes, even if it\u2019s as simple as acrylic nails.

I personally don't do anything to my nails because it's not something I'm interested in, but I'm not going to tell my friend with beautifully done nails that I think something that makes her happy is stupid and dumb.

However, just as you said, we bought them ourselves. The acrylics will last maybe a month to a kid that doesn\u2019t know how to take care of them. \nThat being said I don\u2019t know her house chores.

Acrylics are not only quite expensive, they take constant upkeep. My niece had them while her grandma paid. As soon as grandma said she wasn't paying, my niece stopped getting them done. For reference, not a big city, each visit was around $70.", "ESH. YTA for your approach on this. But I understand your reasoning. I recommend giving her this info: Every time I\u2019m gotten acrylic nails( doesn\u2019t matter the shape or length of the nails), dip powder or not I always end up lifting at least one of my real nails. In total I\u2019ve lifted 6 or 7 of my nails some more than once. The last time I got them done I almost completely ripped off my right middle finger while washing the dishes because I was using the spray dawn soap that\u2019s foamy and from my hands being wet my fingers slipped while spraying it and that nail got caught at an angle. This means it was only attached on the corner (it was latter on both sides and the one corner was also lifted but the other corner that\u2019s under the cuticle thankfully didn\u2019t lift with the rest of it). Then while it was healing my dog jumped and his head hit it which lifted it again. Needless to say it was bruised, including down my finger to my middle knuckle and I had so much adrenaline from it both times I almost got sick from it. I agree that they\u2019re beautiful and going to get them done is a fun experience. But I also agree that they\u2019re damaging to the real nails no matter what. I good middle ground would be polygel nails. I haven\u2019t lifted any of my nails with it, can be just as pretty, can do it yourself or some professionals do it (really have to look hard for one that does it) (there\u2019s kits on Amazon)  and they last about the same amount as acrylics. If taken off incorrectly they still damage the nail, but done correctly and your nails are perfectly fine.\n\nBy no means am I trying to scare anyone with this. But it is a risk you deal with including getting fungus and if you wear acrylics for too long your nails get soft because acrylic suffocates the entire nail. It needs to breathe to stay healthy, hence why it gets damaged a lot even from taking it off. \n \nEdit: added info I forgot about", "YTA.  How is a hair appointment going to be cheaper and less wasteful than getting acrylics?  All of your ideas are a waste of money because your daughter doesn't want any of them.  Why can't you just get her what she wants?  Gifts are a splurge and should be what the recipient wants, not what the giver wants.", "NTA.. ish. Acrylics are a commitment since they require upkeep, and even removing them costs money (though you mentioned money not being an issue).

KISS sells kits", "Let me tell you a story\u2026\n\nI was new to my middle school in 8th grade and it fucking sucked. I didn\u2019t live in that city, I was a low\nSES student compared to the others and it was really really hard to fit in. I noticed all the popular girls had those acrylic nails with the french manicure (this was quite awhile ago). No matter how hard I begged my dad said no. I tried to explain to him how important it was, but of course he didn\u2019t understand. How could a boomer father understanding the politics between 13 year old girls? Even to me now I know how crazy it sounds to say these nails meant everything to me but it obviously wasn\u2019t about the nails, it was about fitting in at a school where I felt alienated due to by \u201cnew girl status\u201d and low SES status among other things. Let me tell you\u2026girls can tell the difference between press on nails and acrylic nails done at a salon\u2026ESPECIALLY JUDGY ASS MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS. Well, my dad did the same as you. He said cheap press on nails or nothing, so I got the press ons. My stepmom did them for me and they looked pretty good but I knew the difference and so did one girl in my PE class that got a close look. She told another girl and a few girls were talking about it. And then a day later, one broke off in class and they all laughed.

By refusing, mum is inadvertently saving her daughter's nails from damage without even knowing.\nI had acrylics done a while back and they filed too much of my nails down. When the acrylics came off, my nails bent like rubber and hurt like hell when I accidentally tapped it against anything. It took weeks to grow out, but those were the most uncomfortable weeks of my life as I had to be hyper-aware and gentle when using my hands.\nI've since turned to gel. Removal strips the nail too, but nowhere near as badly as acrylics do.\n\nOP, please tell your daughter about the damage acrylics cause and offer her an alternative that causes less damage, like powder dips or at a stretch, gel.", "Gel polish and dip mess up your nails as well because, just like press-ons, they recommend that you file your nail surface before applying in order to stay on more than a day or two.

You can\u2019t do the same level at home. At the nail salon you get your nails done, cuticle care, hand massage, the works. How about instead of trying to force her to compromise by changing the gift she gets entirely, you make it clear that since it\u2019s a gift that gets pricey quickly there will not be refills, and prepare her for the fact that after two weeks her nails will hurt if they\u2019re not removed, especially if she goes long, and they will be ruined after the nails come off. She also needs to know that she either needs to cut them and wait for enough air bubbles to come to be able to pop them off (which will HURT and potentially rip her skin since she has no experience and her nails aren\u2019t \u201ctoughened up\u201d), or make the gift a two time thing where she can get them put on and then go back to have them removed safely. This is honestly such a trivial thing that can either make her so sad by saying no or so happy by saying yes that it seems very easy to make the right choice and have a nice bonding experience with your daughter.

You don\u2019t have to understand why she likes things just be happy she\u2019s happy. You as a parent are supposed to give her a safe environment to try things so she can develop her own opinions. A gift is a one time commitment, that is a guaranteed thing to make her happy, allow her to have her own experience and, if she hates it then she made that decision. If she loves it she has to maintain it. Ask people who are acrylic enthusiast to get your monies worth in a clean salon and let her find out. My kid was 13 when she got her nails done and she hated the maintenance and liked not having to worry about the dirt or breaking. And as far as press ons go, certain people like them and others think they are trashy and both opinions are right. I personally hate them.  So does my daughter.

Hence the accusations of ego.", "No, this is you saying that you can get a polyester turtleneck at a big box store, so why would anyone pay more for a pure wool one at a higher end store.", "No, that\u2019s not rude because that\u2019s their preference. Personally I hate everything corduroy. Absolutely everything. If someone shows me something made of that material because they like it, I\u2019m not going to lie and say that I like it as well.

I am not a kid. Nor am I stuck up. Still think they are tacky.\n\nOf course, in this story. My opinion doesn\u2019t matter. Your opinion doesn\u2019t matter and OP\u2019s opinion doesn\u2019t matter. This is just about what a girl has put on her Christmas list.", "$4 for a bottle of soak off at walmart. But she needs to know the ins and outs. $70 for a plain set, that's with the tip for me. It is even more expensive depending on shape, length, and design. $55 every 2 to 3 weeks for fills, more expensive for more extravagant. Break a nail? $5-10 to replace, even if you break it the next effing day. Want fancy fufu nails, that's 2+ hours in a chair, no moving, and no fidgeting. Acrylic press on nails last a good while, look like you got your nails done, and inexpensive on Amazon. They come in different sizes and can be changed weekly at a cheaper price.", "Is it only your money because your husband sounds pretty unhappy with the decision.

I think if you go to a really, really good salon they can look amazing but for most average sets they look bland.", "Also to add that OP has said negative things about acrylics, her daughter is just stating her preference and the downside to press ons in the same way", "No kids and I don\u2019t celebrate Christmas, but thanks for trying :)", "I probably would let the daughter get reasonable-length acrylics if I were OP, that\u2019s not my point. But yeah, anyone who is this determined to let someone know they think their nails are \u201ctacky\u201d and \u201cgross\u201d is going to come across as stuck up. You don\u2019t have to like them, you can prefer acrylics, no one cares. You just don\u2019t have to be so rude about it. I don\u2019t really do either one because I just don\u2019t want to spend the money on upkeep but I have seen really pretty press ons and really ugly acrylics, it\u2019s more about if they\u2019re well done or not.
