I told her that she could look online or I'd take her to ulta and get her press ons that I'd show her how to do. Since that sounds cheap, and because it isn't about the dollar amount, it's about where the money is going, I told her I would try and get her a hair appointment and she could get something fancy done. \n\nMy daughter objected - saying that nobody gets press ons done and that press ons don't look good. Admittedly, I felt hurt as I think I do pretty good on my nails. I told her that she can take my offer or leave it, but she won't be disrespectful. She continued to complain about how she'd be made fun of for having press ons and not the real thing.

OP doesn\u2019t care about that. OP also doesn\u2019t care about the nail damages. Read her comments and you\u2019ll see this is about her ego.

It's not about the amount spent, but what you want isn't worth the value-- how does this make sense especially to a teen who wants the acrylics and not the hair appointment. At that point it seems like you want to control her more than say no. She isn't trying to insult you by not wanting press on nails, but if she has seen one girl teased for press on nails, she is going to be reluctant to compromise here. She is asking for a Christmas present, not a year long commitment. You can say no, but trying to compromise for something that is similar and what you want rather than what she asked for without more reasons than \"this is how I do it\" feels more like control and judgment of what she values than you actually listening to what she wants.", "YTA. She wants it for Christmas. A $60 present. I agree with hubby. Don't you remember being her age and absolutely wanted a (fill in blank)? Do it for her self-esteem boost, not with press ons.

Admittedly, I felt hurt as I think I do pretty good on my nails.\n\nHow hurt do you think your daughter feels because her own mom isn't valuing her wants? She doesn't want press ons. She doesn't want some half-hearted promise to *try* and get a hair appointment. Which is such a cop out by the way.

A gift is meant to be a special treat for someone. If you wanted to get her something else, that is fine, but there is nothing more inherently \u201cworthy\u201d about the gifts you have deemed acceptable vs acrylics, so why do you have to choose this hill to die on? \n\nYTA mostly bc you are arbitrarily imposing your views on your kid and sucking the joy out of life. You can opt to get her a different gift without having a whole drag out about why you refuse to get this particular gift. \n\nAlso your kid rightfully noted that she\u2019d probably get made fun of for wearing press ons. You don\u2019t have to let that get to you, bc what do you care what 14 year olds think is cool? She cares bc she is 14. This isn\u2019t a personal dig at you.", "YTA-  she asked for this to be a Christmas present.  You told her the only Christmas presents she get is what you like not what she want for yourself.", ">I said that she's 14, she doesn't need a symbol of her status\n\nThis seems like a pretty removed sentence from what a 14 year old experiences.  \"Status,\" at least broadly, exists at school and in peer groups at 14.\n\nThe thing is, you've not banned her from getting them done, just that she does it with her own pocket money.  So you're not being hugely unfair here even if you are playing the partental \"I don't see the value card\" which is a regular disconnect between generations.\n\n\"I don't see why they have to waste their money and time listening to that racket!\"  1940s parents talking about their kids (your parents) listening to Hendrix, The Who, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones etc...\n\nSooo... yes, you are being THAT parent.  But hey, she can save up pocket money too so NAH.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole but I think there\u2019s more to it than the dollar cost and end result. Going to the salon is a whole experience. It\u2019s the feeling of being pampered and doing something special for yourself. Picking out a color from the wall. Watching someone work artistically and carefully on something pretty just for you. It\u2019s special. Yes, she could have decent looking nails with press-one, but that\u2019s not the only fun part. That\u2019s why salons are more expensive.", "YTA\n\nIf you had declined because acrylics are damaging. You might have a case. However, your daughter thinks press ons are tacky trash. She is correct. This is more about your ego than your daughter\u2019s happiness.", "The problem with acrylics is you have to keep doing them. So who will be paying for fills and fixes? If it\u2019s a one time deal she\u2019s bound for disappointment after a few weeks, but sometimes kids just need to learn.", "YTA This is like only allowing her to buy the clothes *you* like and thinking it's \"disrespectful\" of her to like anything else. It's ridiculously self centered.\n\nHer Christmas gift should be for *her*. Not for you.", "YTA. Have I seen press on that looks amazing, of course I have, but she\u2019s specifically asking for acrylics. Are acrylic nails worth the money? Yeah, I believe they are to people who enjoy wearing them. They are the same as fake eye lashes, makeup, or any other body enhancements people choose to use/wear. The point isn\u2019t really about something being worth the money, it\u2019s about feeling good about yourself and liking the way something looks on you. \n\nDo you always exclusively buy her gifts that make economical since?  This isn\u2019t a gift for you, it\u2019s for your daughter. It\u2019s about what she\u2019s wants as HER gift.", "Getting her nails done as a Christmas gift and you said no? YTA\n\n\nI can understand if she wanted to get acrylics done and continue to get them done, it gets very expensive.  But as a one time thing, you\u2019re being too harsh. You should have given her the option to get her nails done for Christmas, but if she continues to want acrylics you\u2019d just be buying her press ons.", "YTA. \n\nNot for not letting your daughter get acrylics but how you have handled it. Frankly, it\u2019s rude to tell someone that a gift they want is a waste of money. Your opinion doesn\u2019t matter, hers does. You just told your daughter that her wants don\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t coincide with your perceived \u201cvalue\u201d of it. \n\nThere are so many other reasons to say no. First and foremost is the health of her nails. If done incorrectly, acrylics can be hell on the nail bed. Second, acrylics aren\u2019t just a one-time thing. Letting them grow out leads to breakage and more possible damage to the nail bed. Acrylics either have to be professionally removed or maintained every 10-18 days. \n\nThere are also many alternatives between acrylics and press-ons. Gel nail polish is great - it\u2019s long lasting and sturdy. Dip is also a great option. It has the sturdiness of acrylic while being a lot more healthy for the nails. And if she wants a little length on it, tips can be applied for dip. Frankly, press ons DO NOT compare. At all. It\u2019s such a hassle to deal with it yourself. You have to put in the same amount of work (sometimes more as you get used to it) to remove and replace press ons. And they don\u2019t last nearly as long.\n\nTake it from someone who has had fake nails since she was 14 (30 now), they can absolutely be worthwhile. During Covid, I spent an average of 2 hours every 10 days replacing my at-home press/glue ons and often had to replace 1-3 before each changeout. And I was only working an office job - nothing hard on the hands. Acrylics don\u2019t \u201calways\u201d kill the nails - my nails are naturally garbage and that\u2019s why I got fakes. It stopped frequent breaks that were so far into the nail bed I had to stop using that finger. In my last 20\u2019s, I began to have issues with my acrylics not sticking to my nails. So I switched to dip. Haven\u2019t needed tips for my nails in almost a year, the dip has been able to be put on my real nail. This is the healthiest nail growth I have EVER had.", "I took my granddaughter to get her first acrylics at 11. Five minutes after getting home, she cracked one closing the bathroom door and had to ask for help zipping her pants...that set lasted a week before she soaked them off. I took her for her second set right before the start of eighth grade. That set lasted through her first volleyball practice before she soaked them off!\n\nWere those trips to the salon a \"waste\" of money? I count it as money well spent! I got to admire her her nails, laugh with her about the \"stupid\" nails, and gently tease her about having to zip an 11 year olds jeans for her! But you know what the best thing I got to do was...I got to share some very special bonding time with her! \n\nDid I know that realistically, those nails were never going to last; of course I did. I've \"tried on\" acrylics myself a few times. But sometimes it really is about the experience and the time spent together, and less about what we, as \"adults\" know what we think is the \"better\" thing to do. \n\nSpend time with your daughter, sometimes doing the things she wants to do, even if you don't necessarily see the value in it. You likely will never regret the experience.", "Man, I have a one track mind. Read the title and I was thinking \"what, is this a watercolour family?

If you think it's not a big deal, then let me just tell you a little cautionary tale from my own early teen years. I was at the mall with my mom and dad and I was around your daughter's age. I was maybe 15. It was before the era of acrylics, but there was a nail salon in the mall doing $15 manicures. I was so excited because I'd never had that experience before. I ran to find my parents and I was SO happy. My dad flat out said no and yelled at me for wanting to waste money when I could paint my nails at home. I'm now 30. I've had my nails done with gel, acrylic, dip, you name it and I've done it. I've gotten my nails done more times than I can count. Let me tell you, to this day I remember how hurt I felt that day and the disappointment in my dad never faded over the years. I will never forget that day when I ran to him so happily only for him to decide that my happiness wasn't worth $15 to him. Let that sink in OP...just let that sink in and let her have it. Its about more than JUST nails.", "Acrylics are horrible for the health of your real nails.", "YTA for being argumentative and placing more value on your preferences over your daughter's.  You know what a great idea would be?  Give her $100 as her Christmas gift to do as she pleases with.

I used to do it, but my tech left our podunk town and I have no other options other than to do them myself, which is too much of a bother for me.  Part of why I loved getting my nails done was talking to my tech.  We had a ton in common and it was so nice just doing something just for myself and enjoying the company of someone else.

They weren't really a thing HS girls did in the 90s, at least at my school, but my big sister would get them done and one day she took me. They looked great, but I ended up hating them. The feeling, not being able to do things, etc. I ended up cutting and filing them down short and didn't get them again until I was in my 20s. \n\nYour daughter is at the age where these things matter. I've watched videos from middle school teachers showing off their students' nails. They all get nail art and have long nails. Do you remember what it was like to be a young girl and feel left out because all of the other girls in school were able to have something or do something and you couldn't? That's what your daughter is feeling now. Plus, she's at the age where she wants to do something \"grown up.\" This is, all things considered, a very minor thing to do. Just because you personally don't see value in it and you think your press ons are just as good is irrelevant. She feels it's worth it right now. And maybe she will hate the nails and never want them again. Or maybe she will love them and they'll build some self esteem for her and she'll feel good about herself. Then you can help her budget whatever allowance she gets or whatever she can earn doing chores so that she can save to afford her fills and new polish. \n\nRight now, YTA. You don't get to decide what something is worth to her.", "YTA, you admitted you can afford it and there\u2019s a difference between going regularly and getting them done once as a present. A nail salon is a whole experience and it\u2019s a fun once, especially for someone younger and has never done it before. If you said it\u2019s damaging I could totally see your point but offering to get her hair done when saying nails are to expensive doesn\u2019t make much sense, I mean depending on what you do hair can be expensive, like hundreds of dollars expensive so the money argument isn\u2019t a good one.", "Soft YTA for reasoning. 14 is hard as it is. BUT explaining to a 14 yo that it\u2019s not a one time thing to go get acrylics. The up keep costs too. Fills are needed and breaks happen. They also are really damaging.

She is allowed to not like how you do your nails.  Stop gaslighting her.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s a Christmas gift. Not something she wants to do all the time. Honestly, if nothing else, just think of it as giving your daughter the opportunity to be pampered at the salon and feel special and pretty with attention on her for a bit. I think we all like that from time to time. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for your daughter to want to experience that.\n\nAnd honestly, once she realizes how much it is to keep up on and how much it damages her nails she might even change her mind about liking them. I personally think that they\u2019re not healthy for your nails, and I agree that they\u2019re a waste of money.

And then I learned all of the above myself, and stopped getting them.

I\u2019ve done acrylic, gel, dip, press-on, I\u2019ve done all of it. Now I\u2019ve settled on short gel manicures but if I want to get dressy I use press ons. They last upwards of 2 weeks, same as acrylics, and look just as good (if not better) That said, that trip to the nail salon is a rite of passage to some girls. Let her have the trip, but talk to her first about what to expect. That they only look good for about 2 weeks and then she either has to pay for the upkeep or take them off. The best advise I ever got as a parent is that you have to let your kids make their own mistakes, even if it\u2019s as simple as acrylic nails. In the end, she may feel like it was worth it and that\u2019s ok  because you need to let her be who she is, not who you are. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going with YTA.

She is 14, she is going to hurt your feelings and want to fit in. I honestly don't mind you saying no to her getting her nails done and offering a cheaper alternative.

The waste of money bit is part of christmas, and you sound a bit pretentious over it. Just because YOU think it's a waste of time/money doesn't mean she does. I personally don't do anything to my nails because it's not something I'm interested in, but I'm not going to tell my friend with beautifully done nails that I think something that makes her happy is stupid and dumb.

I have friends that have gotten acrylics, and sure they can be pretty, but cracked, split, bleeding and painful nails are not. So stick to your no, but make it clear that it's because you care about her health, and apologize for making her feel something she wanted was dumb. Take interest in the topic a bit, see if you can find a compromise- no acrylics because of the damage and risks to nail health, but maybe a mom-daughter (or if she'd prefer a day with a friend!) trip to the salon for manicures and cool nail art or something similar. Good luck!", "Lite YTA. \nTake your daughter to the salon for a very basic acrylic and let her see how much $$ it costs for the very fancy designs.

I personally think if you even got her a custom set of high quality press on nails no one would know the difference. It\u2019s better for nail health too. Plus, they are reusable so she could get multiple sets of high quality press ons and reuse them for events that call for it. \nI know it\u2019s all the rage right now my little sisters want them too. However, just as you said, we bought them ourselves. The acrylics will last maybe a month to a kid that doesn\u2019t know how to take care of them. \nThat being said I don\u2019t know her house chores.

Acrylics are not only quite expensive, they take constant upkeep. My niece had them while her grandma paid. As soon as grandma said she wasn't paying, my niece stopped getting them done. For reference, not a big city, each visit was around $70.", "ESH. YTA for your approach on this. But I understand your reasoning. I recommend giving her this info: Every time I\u2019m gotten acrylic nails( doesn\u2019t matter the shape or length of the nails), dip powder or not I always end up lifting at least one of my real nails. In total I\u2019ve lifted 6 or 7 of my nails some more than once. The last time I got them done I almost completely ripped off my right middle finger while washing the dishes because I was using the spray dawn soap that\u2019s foamy and from my hands being wet my fingers slipped while spraying it and that nail got caught at an angle. This means it was only attached on the corner (it was latter on both sides and the one corner was also lifted but the other corner that\u2019s under the cuticle thankfully didn\u2019t lift with the rest of it). Then while it was healing my dog jumped and his head hit it which lifted it again. Needless to say it was bruised, including down my finger to my middle knuckle and I had so much adrenaline from it both times I almost got sick from it. I agree that they\u2019re beautiful and going to get them done is a fun experience. But I also agree that they\u2019re damaging to the real nails no matter what. I good middle ground would be polygel nails. I haven\u2019t lifted any of my nails with it, can be just as pretty, can do it yourself or some professionals do it (really have to look hard for one that does it) (there\u2019s kits on Amazon)  and they last about the same amount as acrylics. If taken off incorrectly they still damage the nail, but done correctly and your nails are perfectly fine.\n\nBy no means am I trying to scare anyone with this. But it is a risk you deal with including getting fungus and if you wear acrylics for too long your nails get soft because acrylic suffocates the entire nail. It needs to breathe to stay healthy, hence why it gets damaged a lot even from taking it off. \n \nEdit: added info I forgot about", "YTA.  How is a hair appointment going to be cheaper and less wasteful than getting acrylics?  All of your ideas are a waste of money because your daughter doesn't want any of them.  Why can't you just get her what she wants?  Gifts are a splurge and should be what the recipient wants, not what the giver wants.", "NTA.. ish. Acrylics are a commitment since they require upkeep, and even removing them costs money (though you mentioned money not being an issue). What if you bought her an acrylic set though so she could learn to do her own? Or it turn into something the two of you could do together? KISS sells kits", "Let me tell you a story\u2026\n\nI was new to my middle school in 8th grade and it fucking sucked. I didn\u2019t live in that city, I was a low\nSES student compared to the others and it was really really hard to fit in. I noticed all the popular girls had those acrylic nails with the french manicure (this was quite awhile ago). No matter how hard I begged my dad said no. I tried to explain to him how important it was, but of course he didn\u2019t understand. How could a boomer father understanding the politics between 13 year old girls? Even to me now I know how crazy it sounds to say these nails meant everything to me but it obviously wasn\u2019t about the nails, it was about fitting in at a school where I felt alienated due to by \u201cnew girl status\u201d and low SES status among other things. Let me tell you\u2026girls can tell the difference between press on nails and acrylic nails done at a salon\u2026ESPECIALLY JUDGY ASS MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS. Well, my dad did the same as you. He said cheap press on nails or nothing, so I got the press ons. My stepmom did them for me and they looked pretty good but I knew the difference and so did one girl in my PE class that got a close look. She told another girl and a few girls were talking about it. And then a day later, one broke off in class and they all laughed.

If she loves it she has to maintain it. Ask people who are acrylic enthusiast to get your monies worth in a clean salon and let her find out. My kid was 13 when she got her nails done and she hated the maintenance and liked not having to worry about the dirt or breaking.

So instead of using glue what I do now is use my acrylic powder and monomer in its place. You have to hold the nail on for a few minutes until it sets, but it\u2019s infinitely better than glue.

My nails are pretty strong, but that doesn't mean I want to ruin them, but I do want them extra nice(and extra long) for special occasions, and it sucks when one snaps and I have to chop the rest down to match", "I suppose so.

It would be a different story if you couldn\u2019t afford it or if she was spending too much of your money on this regularly but she seems to have enough financial awareness at that young age to ask for a trip to the nail salon as a gift. You\u2019re refusing to do it because *you* don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it when in reality acrylics last ~3 weeks and quite frankly IMO look a lot better than press ons, especially if done at a good salon or by a good artist. \n\n\nIt\u2019s not **your** nails so why let something so trivial as acrylics become the hill you\u2019re choosing to die on?

I'd let her know that it would be one of her gifts, and i wouldn't be paying for this to be a regular thing.

Those full sets don\u2019t look so nice when you have to wear a bandage for several weeks. \n\nI went through my acrylic phase from about 14ish to almost mid 20s. I swear, one of my finger nails grows at a bit of an angle now when it didn\u2019t before. Now I just use a strengthener and grow out my natural nails. \n\nBut my mom thought they were stupid too\u2026 and some harmless lessons you just have to learn for yourself.

As the mothers of girls that used to be teenagers acrylic nails (and fake eyelashes) are lessons to be learned. Just get them and be done with it. \n\nYou have some fun cycles of vegetarian/vegan/junk foodaterian to go through too.

My point is, if OP gifts her acrylics just this one time, its setting them up for another argument come time for a fill.\n\nEdit 2: OP- I don\u2019t know if your daughter is at all interested in doing her own nails, but poly gel is an easy way for her to get that same affect as acrylics but at home.

OP and her daughter should discuss the pros and cons calmly, and maybe have a nail tech also talk to the daughter about the realities of nail upkeep.

OP's kid didn't ask for regular nail appointments for acrylics, she asked for one set as a gift for Christmas.
