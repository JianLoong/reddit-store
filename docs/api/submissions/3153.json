{"id": 3153, "submission_id": "z3rgzb", "title": "AITA for leaving my husband home on Thanksgiving", "selftext": "I (28F) have been married to my husband (M31) for nine years. I work full time and I am the default parent. Husband stays home with our one year old. We\u2019ve had issues the entirety of our marriage, mainly due to his untreated mental illness and also his alcoholism. We also share four children. \n\nAfter he released after a six week stint in a rehab facility, I have been making moves to proceed with divorce. I\u2019ve been sitting on the papers, with the desire to serve him and officially file after the holidays. I feel like he\u2019s known this, as his behavior very recently improved a bit. Less time in our basement area drinking, and more time trying to be engaged. \n\nFor context, he struggles with every single holiday and all birthdays. He wakes up in a miserable mood every time, and it\u2019s the most draining thing. I\u2019ve bared my teeth through all major holidays for many years now. But this morning felt good. I got up with our youngest, and got going. I cleaned up our home (a wreck since all four kids and husband were home yesterday). I got the kids up, turned on the parade and got going on breakfast. Husband seemed okay this morning. \n\nOur youngest began fussing for some milk. Husband told our oldest daughter to ask me, in the midst of breakfast prep to get her a bottle. I told her that she\u2019d need to wait since I was very busy. My husband then got up, huffing the whole time. He then got irritated that I placed a bowl in the sink and I was in his way. He then tossed the sippy cup into the sink. \n\nNow fully irritated, I prepped the sippy cup and gave it to my daughter. I\u2019ll admit, I was pissed and I don\u2019t mask emotions well. He angrily asked me what my problem was and when I snipped back \u201cnothing\u201d he lost it. He took his unopened Pepsi van and smashed it on the floor. Pepsi was everywhere. All in my food I was cooking, all up my back, on my ceiling. I LOST it. I told him to get out of my face, that I have divorce papers he will be served with Monday, and that I am packing myself and the kids up and leaving. Once I mentioned divorce his tone instantly became calm and he wanted to talk. I refused. I packed up all 4 kids, myself, and even the finished food. And left. He\u2019s now blowing up my phone saying I ruined Thanksgiving and that because I didn\u2019t want to talk I am an asshole. Am I?\n\nUpdate: \nSo I just wanted to give a little update and clarify a few things. First- I\u2019m a big believer that the number of kids a person has is personal. But we had our first when I was 18, second at 21. At this point things weren\u2019t as bad at all. Our second daughter has some very serious health concerns- and this is what really launched my husband into coping with alcohol. We had our third four years later, when he was sober. And our fourth was a total surprise. I\u2019ve had unprotected sex 4 times- each time resulted in a pregnancy. I feel a large amount of guilt about bringing four babies into this- but I also know that I alone can provide a great life for my babies.\n\nSecondly, I have two papers that I need to get notarized. I have everything else completed, and I have copies of everything. I also took pictures of my kitchen. I can get stuff notarized on Monday and then will be serving those papers. So as of Monday I will begin the process.

Eventually he'll explode at one of them and as soon as it happens once, it'll happen more and more. Get out, but be safe and make sure he doesn't know where you go.
