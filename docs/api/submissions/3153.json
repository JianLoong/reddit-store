{"id": 3153, "submission_id": "z3rgzb", "title": "AITA for leaving my husband home on Thanksgiving", "selftext": "I (28F) have been married to my husband (M31) for nine years. I work full time and I am the default parent. Husband stays home with our one year old. We\u2019ve had issues the entirety of our marriage, mainly due to his untreated mental illness and also his alcoholism. We also share four children. \n\nAfter he released after a six week stint in a rehab facility, I have been making moves to proceed with divorce. I\u2019ve been sitting on the papers, with the desire to serve him and officially file after the holidays. I feel like he\u2019s known this, as his behavior very recently improved a bit. Less time in our basement area drinking, and more time trying to be engaged. \n\nFor context, he struggles with every single holiday and all birthdays. He wakes up in a miserable mood every time, and it\u2019s the most draining thing. I\u2019ve bared my teeth through all major holidays for many years now. But this morning felt good. I got up with our youngest, and got going. I cleaned up our home (a wreck since all four kids and husband were home yesterday). I got the kids up, turned on the parade and got going on breakfast. Husband seemed okay this morning. \n\nOur youngest began fussing for some milk. Husband told our oldest daughter to ask me, in the midst of breakfast prep to get her a bottle. I told her that she\u2019d need to wait since I was very busy. My husband then got up, huffing the whole time. He then got irritated that I placed a bowl in the sink and I was in his way. He then tossed the sippy cup into the sink. \n\nNow fully irritated, I prepped the sippy cup and gave it to my daughter. I\u2019ll admit, I was pissed and I don\u2019t mask emotions well. He angrily asked me what my problem was and when I snipped back \u201cnothing\u201d he lost it. He took his unopened Pepsi van and smashed it on the floor. Pepsi was everywhere. All in my food I was cooking, all up my back, on my ceiling. I LOST it. I told him to get out of my face, that I have divorce papers he will be served with Monday, and that I am packing myself and the kids up and leaving. Once I mentioned divorce his tone instantly became calm and he wanted to talk. I refused. I packed up all 4 kids, myself, and even the finished food. And left. He\u2019s now blowing up my phone saying I ruined Thanksgiving and that because I didn\u2019t want to talk I am an asshole.

Hopefully things are more manageable now that you only have 4...", "NTA. Even if you weren\u2019t planning on the divorce, I\u2019d have packed up my stuff and the kids and hightailed it outta there as quickly as possible. That\u2019s one step from him taking it out on you or the kids. I\u2019d call the police and see if there was any way they could document the incident so if your husband tried anything again they would have a record. It\u2019s also helpful in your divorce case if he tries to fight it, which from his actions, he will. He might fight for custody, which I don\u2019t think is a good idea for anyone unless it\u2019s supervised visitation. Good luck.", "Nta. He needs to get help. You\u2019ve tried for 9 years. You don\u2019t have to live that way.", "I think that this is above Reddit\u2019s paygrade. \n\nBut you are most assuredly NTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that it\u2019s come to this. Kind thoughts to you and your loved ones.", "NTA. Your husband was violent. The only appropriate response is to get the children together and leave. Stay safe, though. Now is the most dangerous time.", "Unfortunately there's probably not much you could do. He's got issues he needs to figure out, and putting you in his path of rage is his own fault. He's not going to get better, and if he's willing to freak out like that in front of the kids you gotta leave. Eventually he'll explode at one of them and as soon as it happens once, it'll happen more and more. Get out, but be safe and make sure he doesn't know where you go. If he gets drunk one night and tries to visit you at your new place it could be very dangerous. NTA", "NTA. He's the one throwing things. I hope your life gets better. Some family counseling may help you and the kids to understand that his behavior is not normal or acceptable.\n\nEdited: typos", "NTA. You did good \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Just wow. NTA", "NTA Divorcing him will be the best thing you can do for both your children and yourself. Please try to get full custody, right now he doesn't sound safe for the children.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve tried really hard. You absolutely needed to get yourself and your children out of that situation. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this and I hope things get better soon.", "NTA \n\nLeaving has been long overdue, sounds like you\u2019ve put up with his toxic BS for way longer than you should\u2019ve.", "NTA. He needs to get help and you need to keep kids away from his outbursts.  Hopefully he will get the help he needs so he can be a good parent.  You can\u2019t make him do anything so you need to worry about yourself and the littles.", "NTA, that was the right thing to do. He physically attacked you and the children in that instance. It was the right thing to do to get your children to safety and it is the right thing to divorce someone who is not only mistreating you but your children. The only person who ruined Thanksgiving is the person who decided to trash the kitchen", "NTA, absolutely not. Your husband has no right to request sympathy at this point, not after proving himself a danger to you and your children. (I'm not sure how you ended up with four children by this man, but carrying on...) Find a safe place to continue with your plans, and calmly insist that he is the one who needs help.", "Don\u2019t back down. You need to see this though for the sake of your kids. This living situation isn\u2019t healthy for anyone. Good luck!", "Sorry is not going to solve this problem\n\nNTA", "absolutely NTA after yrs of dealing with his addicted ass you finally snapped. I would have too (been in similar situation)\n\nAnd OF COURSE he's going to try and talk things out and start the gaslighting bs. Don't fall for it. Stay away and move on with your life.", "NTA. An adult man who destroys things next to his partner is trying to show that it could be your face next.\n\nHe\u2019s a fucking asshole. He behaved in a way that\u2019s not acceptable in polite society, and now he\u2019s furious he\u2019s being excluded. I\u2019m glad you have divorce papers.", "NTA Who thinks if you talk he can talk you out of it, that is why he hates that you left and says you ruined thanksgiving. He probably talks his way out of you leaving him all the time and giving him another chance.", "NTA so long as the serving of divorce papers is happening because both you and your kids don\u2019t deserve to live like this!", "NAH.
