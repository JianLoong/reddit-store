He is a huge soccer fan so obviously he's been following the World Cup.  He works from home so he's been having the games on while he's working.  I work in retail and have an inconsistent schedule, including working on weekends.  With our 2 oldest in school, we've been able to work our schedules around our youngest so we don't have to put her in daycare.  It can be hard on days we both work, with my husband being the one to alter his schedule to watch her.  I am scheduled to work 8am-3pm both days this weekend\n\nLast night I heard my husband on the phone with a friend.  He mentioned something along the lines of \"The sitter will be here at 8 in the morning, so that should give me plenty of time to meet up with you guys.  Just get us a table and I'll meet you there.\"  \n\nI asked him what that was about and he told me that he got a sitter for our kids on Sunday so that he can go watch the World Cup final at a bar with some friends.  The game starts at 9am our time.  I asked him when he was going to tell me about this plan and he told me he literally got off the phone with the sitter 5 minutes before he called his friend.  The sitter is one we've used before, so the kids know her, but she charges a pretty high rate.  We usually only use sitters for date nights, never for just one of us to go to a bar while the other is working.\n\nI told him he was being irresponsible by leaving our kids with a sitter so he can go drink and watch soccer with his friends IN THE MORNING.  He said he's maybe going to have one beer during the game, or maybe none at all.  He just wants to watch the final with his friends instead of at home because he knows the kids don't want to watch it.  He said he wants to actually be able to focus on the game instead of having it on in the background while he's watching the kids.\n\nI told him that with what that sitter charges and him spending money at a bar, we will be losing money as a family even with me working that day.  I told him we never get a sitter for just one of us and that we should be saving that money for when we can both go on a date night.  I told him he needs to call the sitter back and cancel and he can just watch the game at home instead, especially since he didn't talk to me about this first.\n\nHe said he rarely gets time to himself on weekends because of my work schedule and that this is a special occasion.  He said he'll only be gone for a few hours and he'll be back before I get home from work.  I told him he should have talked to me about it first, but he is still refusing to cancel the sitter.\n\nI told him that this isn't a special occasion, it's a game.  A special occasion is an anniversary or birthday, not a soccer game.  He is still refusing to cancel the sitter and I'm not happy about it.", "created_utc": 1671207546, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znihc1/aita_for_wanting_my_husband_to_cancel_a/", "score": 2249, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is he not allowed to do things on his own? Is budget that tight?\n\nHe could have told you about his plans earlier to give you a heads up, but seing as they didn't affect you (he would be home by the time you returned) other than financially, and that he just locked them down (why tell before certain), I can understand that he hadn't.", "YTA. The World Cup Final isn\u2019t just another game, it\u2019s something that only happens every four years.

It's not up to you to decide what's important to him. Birthdays are only \"special\" because they're opportunities to gather with friends to celebrate. There's nothing noteworthy about living another year.\n\nThis is something that happens once every four years that he'd like to spend time with his friends celebrating. If you can't let him hire a sitter to see his friends, you're an AH.

A few hours to himself to enjoy the game and friends will do everyone some good.\n\nHe should have talked to you about what he wanted to do, but seeing how angry you are about it, maybe he opted for the \"begging for forgiveness instead of asking for permission\" route. Regardless, both of y'all need to work on communication skills. And honestly you need to chill out.", "YTA, absolutely", "YTA. Would you just please let that man enjoy one fucking thing? Without you?", "YTA.  Hope you enjoy the single life, cuz unlike your husband thats what\u2019s in your future!", "INFO : How do you split bills ? Do you each have your own \"fun\" money or does the money he uses to pay for the sitter comes from your shared savings ?", "I'm going with ESH. He absolutely should have cleared this with you before making a decision with house money. However, ruling it out completely isn't cool on your part either. This is important to him, and so it should be reasonable to consider hiring help or moving your schedule around in order to make this happen. Both parties are failing to view your arrangement as a partnership, if only for this one day.", "YTA, I could see being a little annoyed at not knowing he planned on hiring a sitter to begin with, but he might have known how you'd react so took the initiative on his own. His actions look very reasonable, it's a sitter yall have used before, and this IS a special occasion for him, you don't get to decide that it's not.\n\nThe whole \"it's a net loss for us today\" is super dumb cause bills aren't calculated on income from one day, it's the whole month, so I'm pretty sure you will still be fine.", "YTA.", "YTA.

Why do you get to decide what constitutes a special occasion worth spending money on? \n\nIf he was hiring a babysitter every weekend you work I would understand why you\u2019re upset, but this sounds really controlling. Everyone deserves to have occasional outings separate from being a spouse or parent.", "YTA since the final of a tournament like this is not  the same as just going out with friend on a random Friday or something that could be repeated. He's actually being responsible by getting a sitter you know and have used before, let the guy enjoy the one game.", "YTA. Let him have ONE thing that isn't related to you. You get a sitter when you go on DATES. When you need time for yourself, who keeps the kids? \n\nLet him enjoy this.", "YTA. He\u2019s not allowed to have a good time unless it\u2019s with you? What an unhealthy idea for a relationship. If you want to stay married than stop being so controlling and let your husband be with his friends, which in case it wasn\u2019t clear to you, IS a \u201cspecial event\u201d for two parents who have no lives outside of being parents.", "YTA.

He probably wasn't gonna tell you at all, but you caught him.\n\nDoes he often do this with your money? A big red flag and I would be looking into completely separating the finances at this point.", "Yta. Believe it or not his world doesn't have to constantly revolve around you and your kids. I know that must be a shocking concept for you. He is allowed to do other things that don't focus on you or them.", "YTA. Yes, he should have discussed it with you first, but even from reading the post, I can see he would have known you well enough to realise he may as well tell you of his plan knowing that a discussion wasn't going to get anywhere.\n\nI don't even like football, but I also can't stand celebrating birthdays. What is it that makes a birthday special? Or celebrating 365 days since the last time you got married? You can't decide what is a special occasion or important to someone else, and the world cup only happens every four years, so if it special to him then you can't tell him he's wrong just because you don't agree.", "NTA he should discuss this with you before he decided. He's not being a partner.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA. It's special to him.", "YTA. It is important to him and he\u2019s usually the one who alters his schedule and is flexible.

But it doesn\u2019t sound like he was hiding it from you - you inserted yourself right before he was going to tell you. \n\nThe World Cup isn\u2019t a common occurrence. He\u2019s being responsible making sure your kids are looked after by a trusted sitter. Tell him to go have fun and next time, you\u2019d appreciate talking about it beforehand.

It is actually a special occasion to him.", "YTA - He's not doing anything wrong.  Let him hang out with his friends doing something he loves. Time to yourself is important as a parent.", "YTA.

He is a soccer fan. This is their Super Bowl, World Series, Stanley Cup all rolled into one.\n\nYou're being very dismissive of his interests and honestly, controlling. 579 words of you, you, you.

He should have communicated with you about the sitter beforehand, especially since this is a joint financial situation.\n\nBut he needs permission from his wife to watch a really big sports event with some friends at a bar? That seems excessive. A soccer game *is* a special occasion to some people, and it sounds like he isn't doing this for all the WC games, just this one.

He has watched while WFH, but for this one game he has made special plans, on the weekend. Sure it\u2019ll cost some money, but this is the kind of game that is better enjoyed with some friends, at a bar. I don\u2019t know what you have a problem with that. A babysitter, a few beers and some snacks don\u2019t cost that much for you to be upset about it, even if it was happening twice a month, much less once every 2 or 4 years. This isn\u2019t enough money or time that he should have to consult his wife. He isn\u2019t buying a car, he is going to the bar with friends for a few hours. He was adult enough to get a babysitter, many guys would just ask their wife to arrange the babysitter. He is a grown man, and you aren\u2019t his mommy.\n\nIf you are micromanaging his use of money to this degree, you might be a bit of a nagging wife, and he might be REALLY tired of it.\n\nIs it possible that you are just jealous that he is getting a babysitter and a half day to go have some fun with some friends as an adult and you reacted negatively bec ause of it.

Babysitters are expensive but if you spend more than you earn daily only once in a while it won't lead you to bankrupcy. It seems like you never spend money on having fun and that will eventually affect you and your relationship.", "YTA Jesus, he alters his work day around the youngest so you don\u2019t have to pay the extra expense of a daycare.

If you\u2019d told the story more like this: \u201cwe\u2019re low on cash, and so we only use excess income for joint outings like birthdays and anniversaries.  It\u2019s been harder on my husband than me because he gets the brunt of the childcare responsibilities, but it\u2019s a sacrifice we\u2019ve both had to make because there just isn\u2019t enough cash to go around.  I realize the World Cup is special to him, but I think he could watch from home (even though I realize it wouldn\u2019t be the same as watching with friends), and it was hurtful and dishonest for him to not have that conversation with me before he made these plans, because a joint discussion/decision is how we navigate these issues,\u201d I think the responses would be a lot more generous to OP.

It isn't about the money when it is something you want to do, but it is when it is something important to him?", "Don't be an AH\n\nJust because it's not a special event for you doesn't make it not a big deal to him\n\nA sitter for a big game every four years doesn't seem like a waste of money", "YTA.\n\nYes, he should have told you earlier, but he did tell you right after he was able to confirm his plans.\n\nWorld Cup final *is* a special occasion for him and his friends. People need more relationships than just family, and people can celebrate all sorts of things.\n\nIf he were doing this *instead* of celebrating a birthday or anniversary that day, I could understand you being upset. But it sounds like you are just upset that he is enjoying and spending money on something that doesn't involve you, which makes you selfish. \n\nLet him enjoy his special occasion, and try not to be so selfish with your expectations in the future.", "Good lord YTA. And controlling to boot. It\u2019s every 4 years, damn right this is a special occasion!

Also it\u2019s football sorry had to get that in there.", "YTA. If you're so concerned about losing money as a family, call out sick and watch the kids yourself. It's not wrong to want some time for things that are part of your individual identity and not the family's, and to make the necessary arrangements to make that happen.", "I get the feeling that OP is more upset about him not telling/asking her first about the sitter situation and told his friends and already made a plan , YTA . \nLET HIM HAVE THIS DAY TO HIMSELF, you said it yourself he is a HUGE soccer fan so this means a lot to him considering how World Cup happens once very FOUR YEARS .", "YTA. I believe you\u2019re intentionally being vague about the hourly cost and using \u201chundreds of dollars\u201d for a few hours as an extreme overreach. Of course it\u2019ll come out of your shared account if neither of you have separate accounts. Where else would he get it from? An event that happens once every four years feels like a pretty special occasion. Just because it isn\u2019t important to you, doesn\u2019t make it any less important for him. Husbands and wives are allowed to spend money on things for themselves, and it\u2019d be unhealthy to only go out together and have no time for friends or themselves.", "YTA\n\none day, you will have something important that's just for you that you will want a babysitter for and he'll remember your attitude", "YTA. This is a once in every four years event. It sounds like he\u2019s an equitable contributor to childcare or he may even do more of it if you work weekend when the kids are out of school. There\u2019s no reason to deny him this opportunity.", "YTA. If he is a huge soccer fan, then this match is the single biggest match for the next 4 years. He would be gone 3-4 hours tops. He made arrangements. Should he have run it by you? Yes. But, people get excited about this, and he probably thought he was being responsible by getting it sorted. Unless he does stuff like this a lot, tell him to have fun, but next time let's talk about it first.\n\nAnd one other thing, I am sure your husband loves going on dates with you (as I do with my wife), but if he is like most men, the \"date\" is WAY more for him than for you. Most men are happy with simple evenings without the pomp and expense of going out. So, while you might view the date nights as for both of you, I would bet they are much more for you than for him.", "YTA. Life is short. Sacrifices are being made to save on childcare. Everyone deserves to indulge in themselves every once in awhile. Yes he should have talked to you in advance. There might be such a thing as being too responsible.

This is not just a game for him, it's something he's deeply interested in and wants to experience with his friends. It's a hobby he enjoys and this is a special occasion. \n\nYou also mention that he is the one that regularly works his schedule around to take care of the kids. That's great! It shows that he cares. Let him have this treat for being the one that has sacrificed his time.\n\nIt's also not like he was hiding this, he literally just got off the phone with the babysitter. \n\nIt's a babysitter you trust and just because it's not a special occasion to you doesn't mean it's not special to him.

It sounds like you could use a fun break from routine as well. Help each other get these small breathers in life.", "YTA. You are both parents. It\u2019s not unreasonable to hire a sitter to meet up with friends even if you aren\u2019t invited. \n\nI don\u2019t have kids, but I can tell you what working from home with two high energy dogs is. Give the man a break. \n\nHe is allowed to leave the house.", "YTA let him go have some fun. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s doing it every weekend", "YTA. You\u2019re both adults, why does he need your permission? He organised a sitter, isn\u2019t planning to drink much if at all and once in 4 years wants to watch a match in peace! \n\nThere\u2019s a huge difference between controlling someone and discussing things \n\nYeah it\u2019s an expense and he\u2019s not doing it with you but does he never get to spend a little without your permission?! it\u2019s not like he\u2019s spending it on gambling or something but a trusted sitter fgs!", "YTA - the one thing that I will give you is it would have been better if he spoke with you before calling the sitter.  Now this isn't just \"some game\".  It's THE game.  You yourself said that your husband is a huge soccer fan.  This game only happens once every four years.  This is the pinnacle in the soccer world.  This game will be watched by BILLIONS across the world(100x more than the Superbowl).  It's the world cup final and only happens once every four years.  Bars across America will be opening up early to show this game and the bars will be packed.  I'm on the West Coast and the game kicks off at 7AM and I, myself, will be at a fully packed bar to watch this game.  TBH, this just sounds like you are feeling a little jealous that he is going to have a fun day while you are at work.  The kids are taken care of, you are not financially hurting, and this happens once every four years.  Let it go.", "I agree he should\u2019ve told you beforehand but YTA for not letting him have this O N E day outside the house. It\u2019s one day. One. And you can\u2019t let him have it? If you wanted to go out with your girls for a day I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be fine with it, so what\u2019s with the double standard here? If it truly is JUST the price that\u2019s the issue, find a cheaper sitter for the day. Problem solved.", "YTA. I\u2019m doing the same thing Sunday morning (but my wife will have the kids). If he\u2019s a big soccer fan, this event only happens every 4 years so it\u2019s a really big deal.", "Sounds like he needs some time off. People need to socialise and if it's something he enjoys especially so.\nYTA for making no effort to empathize with your partner.\nHe should have discussed this with you before hand but I still support your husband.", "YTA. Totally and utterly!", "YTA. it's once every 4 yrs the wc comes around; i'll be watching it on sunday too. it's a 90 min game (with maybe a little extra time added), and he'll be back before u get back from work, & there's a sitter. this shouldnt be an issue imo, he wont even be gone that long.", "NTA BECAUSE FINANCES. I am sure this would be a non issue if finances were not a problem. Her husband is spending more on one day than she would make working. That does not seem fair.\n\nI am surprised at all the YTAs...\n\nCan someone explain why it's ok for the husband to spend like this without a discussion? The family is clearly on a budget", "YTA. You must be so much fun to be around. Sooner or later your husband will resent you.", "YTA. Sounds like he sacrifices a lot more then you do. Give him this or have him resent you for the rest of your marriage. He is allowed to do stuff for himself he even got a sitter so the kids will be taken care of what's the bfd?", "Soft YTA\nHe is a person first, not just parent, he needs time away for his own things as do you. \nShould he have talked with you a better about his plans ya probably but it's honestly not that big of a deal. It's a once in few year opportunity thing for him, so it's understandable he wants to have that time without wanting to worry about the kids.", "Slight YTA. I think it's something that he should have told you before getting the babysitter, but it's not a big deal, and you could have asked him to do the same to you at some point, like give you a free morning or night to go out with your friends on your own, or spend the time as you want.\n\nAlso, this will be the last world cup for Messi, so it is a special occasion :)", " YTA-  He rarely gets time to himself and he works from home.

He is being responsible. This is a big deal for him and he\u2019s allowed to have hobbies and interests.

Let him enjoy the game ffs.", "YTA\n\nHe's doing the responsible thing here, so he can watch something that only happens once every 4 yrs. He's not making it your problem about who is going to watch the kids,(he also as you've said was about to tell you but you eves dropped on a conversation and accused before he had te chance to speak to you )\n\nHe just wants to have some alone time with his friends without worrying about the kids. Everyone deserves that once in a while, and I'd be saying the same thing if this was the other way around too", "YTA. Also you might want to consider getting employed as a babysitter if your full days pay cant cover the cost of 3-4 hours and a beer", "YTA bordering on an E.S.H. though\n\nI agree with what pretty much everyone is saying. This is a World Cup CHAMPIONSHIP Game, it is a special occasion. Especially because all of his friends are gathering to watch it. You admit that he will adjust his schedule to watch the kids. It really seems like he compromises his time a lot, so it really bothers me that this one time he wants to just go out, be with friends, and enjoy something he loves it is such an issue. \n\nI also really hate how you act like he's going to get trashed at this bar while watching a soccer game even though he said he's having a beer max.\n\nMy only issue is if he was hiding that he hid a sitter. If what he said was true, and I am inclined to believe him, that it was a quick decision and he was going to tell you soon, then that's fine. If he's been planning this for a while... boo him.\n\nTLDR - He compromises his time, let him have this. It is a big deal for people who love the sport.", "YTA. Let him enjoy. What\u2019s the problem?", "If the rolls were reversed you\u2019d be outraged that he\u2019d try and tell you no when appropriate childcare was arranged.

I don't think he should be making expensive plans without consulting you. I'd be mad if my husband planned something significant like that without talking to me before making the call. I wouldn't need \"notice\" but I'd want to be included in the decision.\n\nHowever, everyone deserves a break on their own and it sounds like he's telling you he needs this. If something were important to my husband, like this clearly is to yours, I would let him go. But I'd expect him to come back (mostly) sober so he can take care of the kids.\n\nI don't think you would have extended the same graciousness, however. Is it a pattern in your relationship that you're always the one saying no?", "I feel like YTA cause you sound kinda selfish about the whole thing. At least he called someone you knew and didn\u2019t just leave them with a stranger. As for her rate, you should be paying her a fair wage to watch three children. It\u2019s not easy! (As you know being a parent!) r/nanny could have a field day with that one.", "It was not great for him to decide and set this all up without so much as mentioning it to you when he had the idea, especially if money is an issue, but the way youre dismissing him is equally concerning \n\nIts not special to *you* but it *is* special \n\nUnless this is gonna damage your finances in a way that puts your household at risk, a few hours to spend time with his friends for something that only happens once every 4 years is totally reasonable. Even if you prefer to spend your downtime with him youre both still entitled to your own time apart. If you really think hes gonna get plastered in a few hours when he knows hes gotta be home to watch your kids youve got bigger problems than a surprise sitter \n\nHe absolutely shouldve talked to you about this before calling anyone and yall need to work that out but its done now and its not like he bought a maserati instead of diapers so this is a ESH", "YTA the way you phrase everything makes it sound like he's not allowed to have fun", "YTA. I don\u2019t care about the World Cup but I do care about the NBA finals (and my husband does not) and if he couldn\u2019t keep the kids for work or something I would absolutely get a sitter so I could go watch it.", "YTA\n\nSounds like you are mad you won\u2019t get to benefit from it since you will be at work.\n\nGetting the babysitter to go hangout is being responsible. You already said you don\u2019t use her often so this isn\u2019t even a pattern with hubby.\n\nKids would distract him from the game. Those who are into sports are paying attention to the tv and their friends (if there).\n\nSounds like your mad he will get to have some fun. You should plan yourself some fun with your friends and use some funds for the sitter so you can enjoy yourself (and not be angry about this). \n\nThe money is well spent if you get a much needed break.", "YTA. \n\nI get that you both seem really overworked, but at least you get to leave the house for work. Your poor hubby doesn't get that luxury, and has to stay productive while watching kids. Exactly how often does he get a chance to be kid-free? If babysitters are only for date nights and times when you both get to go, it doesn't seem like it's going to be often. When did he last get to hang out with his friends? When did you? Why does he need your permission to responsibly organize a break for himself? He's their parent too, and a working member of the household, you're not his Mommy.\n\nYou guys clearly need to work out more breaks for the both of you. You seem extremely resentful that he organized time for himself without you.", "YTA\nLet him have some me time with his friends", "YTA - you make him rearrange his schedule you it to suit you and one time he's found a way around it so the kids are safe and he can do something on the weekend that is once in a 4 year celebration- it's a no? \n\nthis is not a hill you want to die on", "YTA. You\u2019re more than welcome to use the sitter when you want to go out\u2026that\u2019s what people use them for. This is weird and it seems like u don\u2019t want him to have more fun than you. Like a controlling mom almost.\nIt\u2019s not a football game that happens every Sunday. Let him enjoy the World Cup. Poor guy", "YTA\n\nHe wants to watch the final with friends in the morning. I understand that it is a cost but once in Attis not bad. Have you seen if you could work the evening shift so no sitter is needed \n\nHe is in the house for work and there on the weekend with the kids. That is a lot of time looking at the same four walls", "YTA \nHe got a sitter! It's not like he assumed you were going to have to stay with the kids? I really don't get this. It would be different if you people were dead broke. Is that it?", "YTA. It's the World Cup final. It happens every 4 years. It IS a special event. It's not his fault it's airing in the morning time. It doesn't matter if you think it's important. It's important to him. I am sure you've made plans to do things important to you that aren't important to him. Did he give you a hard time about it?", "YTA\n\n>With our 2 oldest in school, we've been able to work our schedules around our youngest so we don't have to put her in daycare. It can be hard on days we both work, with my husband being the one to alter his schedule to watch her. I am scheduled to work 8am-3pm both days this weekend\n\nYour husband works from home and is the one who you admit has to alter his schedule more often to watch the kids. You're also working all weekend which means in addition to parenting the youngest during the week so you save on daycare, he now has to parent all weekend, too. And all he wants to do is go out for a few hours with his friends.\n\nIf you're concerned about a babysitter costing more than what you're going to make that day, can you call of that day and parent them yourself so your husband can go out?", "YTA. Definitely no question about it. The experience at the bar is to another level than at home. It's the final, give the man his bone. You can do the same for yourself for a really special occasion. It really just seems like you are acting selfishly out of jealousy. What is with this pettiness that you can only call a sitter if both of you are doing something. That's quite ridiculous and childish. Just because something isn't special to you doesn't mean it is not special for him. It only happens every 4 years and seems like he's quite the dutiful father majority of the time so I'm really confused by your disappointment.\n\nYou are justified that you wanted better communication, but ultimately your making a mountain out of a molehill. As many have said, you also deserve time with your girlfriends. Let him go and do your own special thing with them in the future.", "YTA.", "YTA - let him go out and have fun with the boys. What\u2019s the big deal? This is a special occasion to him.", "Sorry, but the final match of the World Cup is a special occasion.

Given that this is a rare occasion, let him have his fun.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You both are allowed to do things separately to enjoy yourself. He has hired a sitter that you guys know and trust.

It\u2019s healthy.", "It sounds as though you think the only reasonable use of childcare is for you to have a datenight, rather than for either of you to maintain your own life and interests. He probably should have given you a heads up but it maybe he knew you'd be unreasonable. \n\nThis just comes across as you thinking it's a meaningless thing because you don't like it and because he didnt do as you told him to\n\nYTA", "YTA. 100%", "YTA! It is a speciel occasion. It happens every 4 years and you have to watch it live. \nGive the poor man the whole day with his friends and beers.", "Definitely the asshole. It's not just about the kids distracting him, it's about enjoying the atmosphere with friends. Also, isn't your husband having a good time worth more than the 'money you're gonna lose' over this? You are being selfish and he seems like a good dad.", "YTA. 'it's not a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary'. Yeah, cause those things happen every year as opposed to the WC that happens once every 4 years and lasts like a month. \n\nThe fact that you know this is something your husband is passionate about and are still being so harsh about him getting a sitter for a few hours to enjoy the final of this once-in-four-years event shows me how little regard you actually have for your husband and his interests if they don't align with your own. Wonder how that kind of behavior will serve you in the future in terms of staying in this marriage.", "YTA, sorry but \n\n1) he's your husband not your child, and as such does not need your permission to do anything. Yes he really should have spoke to you about it but telling him what to do is a big no no. He doesn't need your permission. \n2) you have no right to tell him to cancel anything especially when you say he is the one that usually moves his work etc around to suit the family, he obviously has a job and contributes to the household so it's his choice. Plus the world cup is once every 4 years not every few months. \n3) sounds to be more the fact, that he wants something for himself, you do not get anything out of it and you're jealous of that. \n\nHonestly if my wife or I, ever tried to tell each other you're not doing something, there would want to be a life and death reason unknown to the other party or it would want to be a joke. I'd do it twice as big just to prove the point. I'd make a day of it and so would she!

He\u2019d always tell me \u201cyour birthday is coming up cause so are the races.\u201d I get it. Men need hobbies. World Cup only happens every 4 years. But the smart responsible thing to do, especially because he didn\u2019t consult you is to host the World Cup at your house. That way no money is wasted, he can have the \u201cone beer\u201d he so claims he wants, and no sitter is needed.

He doesn\u2019t NEED to go to the bar to watch this game. It\u2019s really not that deep. He made this decision to spend your family\u2019s money on something unnecessary. I imagine you probably wouldn\u2019t have made that choice and so you\u2019re upset that he can so thoughtlessly put y\u2019all in the hole for the day. I\u2019m sure you also have times where you would like to hire a sitter but don\u2019t because you\u2019re considering the bigger picture.

Plus he is probably going to want food and drink so let\u2019s say an even 200$. And you will make less than that at work that day and you bring in 40% of the household income. So the info I need is how tight is money right now, will this effect savings or your day to day life? Because for some people 200$ is nothing. For others it\u2019s critical.

To me, this entirely depends on their finances.", "These are the kind of responses I look for. Genuine human concern. I appreciate you", "I thought this was the most insightful comment here. Everyone has a strict YTA ruling but we\u2019re missing a lot of context. How tight is money exactly that having a net loss for one day would be not okay? Does OP manage most of the financial management so she sees more of what their needs are? How expensive is the babysitter? Where I live, it can be extremely costly so I\u2019m curious. How much are y\u2019all making exactly because working in retail plus three young kids with an unnamed source of income from dad\u2026 yeah that doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s a lot of wiggle room unless dad is making a LOT. \n\nJust an idea. Could him and his buddies come over instead? Ask the three year old to play quietly in the same room or watch the game with him and his friends? That way, there\u2019s no money going out for the babysitter and he still gets to see his friends. He already wasn\u2019t planning on drinking very much of at all so he would still be alright to watch the kid. Plus it would be good bonding! I know it\u2019s not ideal but if money is extremely tight, this might be the best option. If money isn\u2019t that tight, where the babysitter money needs to be used for utilities or groceries or another necessity instead, I\u2019d say he should go so that he gets some time. \n\nI know a lot of people are going to state that that\u2019s not fair to him and I agree, it\u2019s not. A lot of things aren\u2019t fair when you have kids and money is tight. I know lots of families have had to make sacrifices to make things work and sometimes, that means not going out. For some families like mine growing up, babysitter money was money that needed to be used for food or utilities or healthcare instead since we were often sick. Keeping that in mind, if it\u2019s possible, try to keep a little cushion, rainy day fund in the future so that one of you CAN take time off for things that you want to do yourselves. Finances are important but you\u2019ll both burn out if you don\u2019t schedule time for yourselves. \n\nAgain, if money being very tight is the case, I don\u2019t fault OP for being stressed about finances but please, make a cushion fund so you can hire a babysitter every once in a while.", "Yes! OP should do this once or twice, too! Guessing since she's working retail she's probably working a bunch of hours right now.

I understand the judgments, but as a burnt out SAHM I completely empathize with the frustration. Even wonderful husbands / great dads can be a bit blind to the free time they get / take while moms feel more obligated to suck it up and ignore their needs for\u2026 fun. I don\u2019t technically have my own income, so on the surface it would appear that I don\u2019t earn enough to cover a babysitter. But, I\u2019m a person and need unstructured time (don\u2019t actually get it unfortunately). \n\nThe sticking point IMO is more that he didn\u2019t inform her and she found out overhearing it. Pretty sure if she booked a babysitter to head out with the girls for a once every four years 8am mimosa brunch or something, the dad may be annoyed at not knowing. Bad example but you know what I mean. It may seem frivolous to him but be important to her.

I don't know how much sitters cost, but I'm going to assume $30/hr on the high side. If the whole game, with stoppage time, and if it goes to Extra time, you are looking at approx 2.5 hours. If penalties add another .5 hour and 1 hour for travel to and from, so all told, this might equal 4 hours of sitter time needed. So that would be $120 on the high end for a sitter. I am in the middle of middle class, single father of 2 and I could easily afford that, and honestly they should be able to as well, without breaking the bank. 8 feel it's probably less than that, and she just wants to control the situation.", "Exactly!!!", "I feel like specifically the line \"he might not know how you'd react so took the initiative\" sounds a lot like \"it's easier to get forgiveness than permission\" \n\nAnd that's a bullshit thing to do to a partner.

I agree with some of the people saying Y T A, because OPs husband was responsible in hiring the sitter, but I can't imagine a world where my husband would get a sitter for a planned event without talking to me first. And I don't love that he called his friend before talking to his wife. She still doesn't have the right to make the decision that sitters should be saved for shared couples activities. Everyone needs a day off of parenting sometimes, and asking for 4ish hours to just watch a global event is pretty reasonable.", "It\u2019s okay because\u2026misogyny.

Its not her favorite thing to watch.", "Well, she says they should be spending the money on date night. The fact that\u2019s even an option tells me that they can afford the sitter. It\u2019s not like they are choosing between World Cup and the mortgage bill. It\u2019s between the husband watching a match he really cares about vs they two of them going on a date. Maybe skip one date once in four years so he can do this.", "I can still see that as financial honestly. If money is tight, it doesn\u2019t make sense for one person to go out while the other person works just to still be at a loss for the day. If they\u2019re going to take a net loss, they both should go out and enjoy it. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they should go out together to do something like OP states but maybe do separate activities. Likewise, if OP is responsible for the majority of the financial oversight, they might feel resentful that husband gets to go out while they\u2019re stressed about money. \n\nAgain, all of this depends on how tight money is though. Sometimes you have to pick your battles and I don\u2019t think this one is worth fighting over, especially if money isn\u2019t too tight. I\u2019d heavily emphasize for all couples talk to each other and work out a plan to put away some of their OWN money, not money from a shared fund, for their own rainy day personal activities. This doesn\u2019t work here because it\u2019s retroactive plus it sounds like they have shared finances. Again, please always keep money on the side for yourself for things like this. Discuss this with all partners people!", "Date nights are very important, especially for couples with dependents. He might very well have used the budget for that week's date night on his solo outing with friends, thus canceling it without asking. If money is extremely tight, he might actually be harming his relationship with his wife and kids by doing this. Of course, we simply don't have the information to say one way or the other right now.\n\nETA: Reading more of OP's comments makes me think that finances are actually not this tight, but we still don't actually know for sure.", "I didn\u2019t see her other comments and again, I\u2019m not making excuses. I think in general, regardless of who does it, spending money when it\u2019s tight makes both of them dicks to each other and especially to the kids. It sounds like they\u2019re both angry and taking it out on each other. Time apart might be wise. I still wish I could get the info on who manages most of the finances and takes care of the finances though. Ideally that would be directly in the post. \n\nIs it lame to ask your buddies to come over while your kid is in the house? Yeah. But again, you have to do shit things when you have kids and money is an issue. It doesn\u2019t have to suck either. Growing up, when my brother was a kid, we often had game days with my dads buddies and it was never a bother because we went into the mindset of, \u201cthis is for everyone\u2019s good and just what we have to do.\u201d It also worked out culturally for us though. \n\nNeither of them should have to hold financial issues over the other and at this point, this particular situation can\u2019t be remedied. Quite frankly, things like childcare should have been considered before having a third child but I understand that everyone is coming from different situations and that not everywhere is the same economically as it was three years ago. \n\nAt this point, OP needs to learn to pick her battles. This particular situation needs to be over with and in the future, they need to work something out. I stated in other comments that they should discuss having separate funds for day offs coming from their own incomes. That should help avoid issues like this in the future", "Right. I just added a further comment a second ago but I think the main problem is that he took money from shared finances while money seems tight. I\u2019d recommend OP to not be so hard on him because he may just be burnt out and need time to himself. Economic hardship does nothing except drive a wedge in families and makes everyone stressed. I can\u2019t fault either of them here.", "I\u2019ve said this so many times in other comments but I can\u2019t fault either of them. This is more sad than anything and just goes to show how financial struggles create rough family situations. There\u2019s a lot going wrong here. Mom sounds financially stressed out, dad is probably burnt out, no communication, etc. \n\nEveryone also seeing it in black and white and not getting the big issue isn\u2019t just going out for a game but that they weren\u2019t prepared to take time off for a solo activity or ever planned it into the budget speaks to larger problems than just going out for a game.", "Again, I can\u2019t fault either of them. Your sister and her ex might not be in the same situation as OP here. I know for me, I get really stressed about finances because for a variety of reasons. Back when money was a lot tighter in my household, the idea of one person getting to go out and have fun while someone else was stressed about money was not okay and a little selfish. OP is seemingly under a lot of financial stress and sometimes, you can\u2019t think of solutions until way after the fact. In times like this, it becomes helpful to ask other people for compromises and solutions. \n\nI can\u2019t fault either of them. I personally feel like we\u2019re lacking a lot of context but I can only wish them the best and offer advice that I\u2019ve listed in other comments.", "He should have talked to her before calling the sitter. Surely he knows the budget is tight? Maybe she would have had some other ideas for a sitter that would be less expensive. He absolutely deserves to be able to go out with his friends, but he still needs to be mindful of their financial situation. \n\nShe does sound a bit upset at the idea that he\u2019s having free time while she\u2019s at work, and she doesn\u2019t value his choice of activity at all, so I think she\u2019s more TA. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019d be on board with help him make this outing happen, which sucks. But, any expenditure that costs a day\u2019s wages seems like something that should be talked about in advance of booking.", "We have been so torn about this issue - we really love watching the games, especially with Messi being in the finals.
