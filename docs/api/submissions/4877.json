He is a huge soccer fan so obviously he's been following the World Cup.  He works from home so he's been having the games on while he's working.  I work in retail and have an inconsistent schedule, including working on weekends.  With our 2 oldest in school, we've been able to work our schedules around our youngest so we don't have to put her in daycare.  It can be hard on days we both work, with my husband being the one to alter his schedule to watch her.  I am scheduled to work 8am-3pm both days this weekend\n\nLast night I heard my husband on the phone with a friend.  He mentioned something along the lines of \"The sitter will be here at 8 in the morning, so that should give me plenty of time to meet up with you guys.  Just get us a table and I'll meet you there.\"  \n\nI asked him what that was about and he told me that he got a sitter for our kids on Sunday so that he can go watch the World Cup final at a bar with some friends.  The game starts at 9am our time.  I asked him when he was going to tell me about this plan and he told me he literally got off the phone with the sitter 5 minutes before he called his friend.  The sitter is one we've used before, so the kids know her, but she charges a pretty high rate.  We usually only use sitters for date nights, never for just one of us to go to a bar while the other is working.\n\nI told him he was being irresponsible by leaving our kids with a sitter so he can go drink and watch soccer with his friends IN THE MORNING.  He said he's maybe going to have one beer during the game, or maybe none at all.  He just wants to watch the final with his friends instead of at home because he knows the kids don't want to watch it.  He said he wants to actually be able to focus on the game instead of having it on in the background while he's watching the kids.\n\nI told him that with what that sitter charges and him spending money at a bar, we will be losing money as a family even with me working that day.  I told him we never get a sitter for just one of us and that we should be saving that money for when we can both go on a date night.  I told him he needs to call the sitter back and cancel and he can just watch the game at home instead, especially since he didn't talk to me about this first.\n\nHe said he rarely gets time to himself on weekends because of my work schedule and that this is a special occasion.  He said he'll only be gone for a few hours and he'll be back before I get home from work.  I told him he should have talked to me about it first, but he is still refusing to cancel the sitter.\n\nI told him that this isn't a special occasion, it's a game.  A special occasion is an anniversary or birthday, not a soccer game.  He is still refusing to cancel the sitter and I'm not happy about it.", "created_utc": 1671207546, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znihc1/aita_for_wanting_my_husband_to_cancel_a/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is he not allowed to do things on his own? Is budget that tight?\n\nHe could have told you about his plans earlier to give you a heads up, but seing as they didn't affect you (he would be home by the time you returned) other than financially, and that he just locked them down (why tell before certain), I can understand that he hadn't.", "YTA. The World Cup Final isn\u2019t just another game, it\u2019s something that only happens every four years.

It's not up to you to decide what's important to him. Birthdays are only \"special\" because they're opportunities to gather with friends to celebrate. There's nothing noteworthy about living another year.\n\nThis is something that happens once every four years that he'd like to spend time with his friends celebrating. If you can't let him hire a sitter to see his friends, you're an AH.

A few hours to himself to enjoy the game and friends will do everyone some good.\n\nHe should have talked to you about what he wanted to do, but seeing how angry you are about it, maybe he opted for the \"begging for forgiveness instead of asking for permission\" route. Regardless, both of y'all need to work on communication skills. And honestly you need to chill out.", "YTA, absolutely", "YTA. Would you just please let that man enjoy one fucking thing? Without you?", "YTA.  Hope you enjoy the single life, cuz unlike your husband thats what\u2019s in your future!", "INFO : How do you split bills ? Do you each have your own \"fun\" money or does the money he uses to pay for the sitter comes from your shared savings ?", "I'm going with ESH. He absolutely should have cleared this with you before making a decision with house money. However, ruling it out completely isn't cool on your part either. This is important to him, and so it should be reasonable to consider hiring help or moving your schedule around in order to make this happen. Both parties are failing to view your arrangement as a partnership, if only for this one day.", "YTA, I could see being a little annoyed at not knowing he planned on hiring a sitter to begin with, but he might have known how you'd react so took the initiative on his own. His actions look very reasonable, it's a sitter yall have used before, and this IS a special occasion for him, you don't get to decide that it's not.\n\nThe whole \"it's a net loss for us today\" is super dumb cause bills aren't calculated on income from one day, it's the whole month, so I'm pretty sure you will still be fine.", "YTA.", "YTA.

Why do you get to decide what constitutes a special occasion worth spending money on? \n\nIf he was hiring a babysitter every weekend you work I would understand why you\u2019re upset, but this sounds really controlling. Everyone deserves to have occasional outings separate from being a spouse or parent.", "YTA since the final of a tournament like this is not  the same as just going out with friend on a random Friday or something that could be repeated. He's actually being responsible by getting a sitter you know and have used before, let the guy enjoy the one game.", "YTA. Let him have ONE thing that isn't related to you. You get a sitter when you go on DATES. When you need time for yourself, who keeps the kids? \n\nLet him enjoy this.", "YTA. He\u2019s not allowed to have a good time unless it\u2019s with you? What an unhealthy idea for a relationship. If you want to stay married than stop being so controlling and let your husband be with his friends, which in case it wasn\u2019t clear to you, IS a \u201cspecial event\u201d for two parents who have no lives outside of being parents.", "YTA.

He probably wasn't gonna tell you at all, but you caught him.\n\nDoes he often do this with your money? A big red flag and I would be looking into completely separating the finances at this point.", "Yta. Believe it or not his world doesn't have to constantly revolve around you and your kids. I know that must be a shocking concept for you. He is allowed to do other things that don't focus on you or them.", "YTA. Yes, he should have discussed it with you first, but even from reading the post, I can see he would have known you well enough to realise he may as well tell you of his plan knowing that a discussion wasn't going to get anywhere.\n\nI don't even like football, but I also can't stand celebrating birthdays. What is it that makes a birthday special? Or celebrating 365 days since the last time you got married? You can't decide what is a special occasion or important to someone else, and the world cup only happens every four years, so if it special to him then you can't tell him he's wrong just because you don't agree.", "NTA he should discuss this with you before he decided. He's not being a partner.", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA. It's special to him.", "YTA. It is important to him and he\u2019s usually the one who alters his schedule and is flexible.

But it doesn\u2019t sound like he was hiding it from you - you inserted yourself right before he was going to tell you. \n\nThe World Cup isn\u2019t a common occurrence. He\u2019s being responsible making sure your kids are looked after by a trusted sitter. Tell him to go have fun and next time, you\u2019d appreciate talking about it beforehand.

It is actually a special occasion to him.", "YTA - He's not doing anything wrong.  Let him hang out with his friends doing something he loves. Time to yourself is important as a parent.", "YTA.

He is a soccer fan. This is their Super Bowl, World Series, Stanley Cup all rolled into one.\n\nYou're being very dismissive of his interests and honestly, controlling. 579 words of you, you, you.

He should have communicated with you about the sitter beforehand, especially since this is a joint financial situation.\n\nBut he needs permission from his wife to watch a really big sports event with some friends at a bar? That seems excessive. A soccer game *is* a special occasion to some people, and it sounds like he isn't doing this for all the WC games, just this one.

I hope he has fun.", "YTA, and it\u2019s football.", "It's funny how you obsess over what is a completely meaningless expense when the obvious solution is you step up and get a job with consistent hours that pays you more.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike even if the baby sitter charges literally 50 an hour, he's going to be gone for at the most 4 hours.

He has watched while WFH, but for this one game he has made special plans, on the weekend. Sure it\u2019ll cost some money, but this is the kind of game that is better enjoyed with some friends, at a bar. I don\u2019t know what you have a problem with that. A babysitter, a few beers and some snacks don\u2019t cost that much for you to be upset about it, even if it was happening twice a month, much less once every 2 or 4 years. This isn\u2019t enough money or time that he should have to consult his wife. He isn\u2019t buying a car, he is going to the bar with friends for a few hours. He was adult enough to get a babysitter, many guys would just ask their wife to arrange the babysitter. He is a grown man, and you aren\u2019t his mommy.\n\nIf you are micromanaging his use of money to this degree, you might be a bit of a nagging wife, and he might be REALLY tired of it.\n\nIs it possible that you are just jealous that he is getting a babysitter and a half day to go have some fun with some friends as an adult and you reacted negatively bec ause of it.

Torn between  E S H and Y T A and since the financial aspect seems to be one of your main sticking points I feel it\u2019s an important question.", "Gentle YTA because World Cup finals happen only once every four years and your husband was responsible enough to organise the babysitter. \nBut the fact this is stressing you out makes me wonder: how burned out are you? How much stress are you both under, that a couple of hours on a weekend are this big a deal? Are you feeling mom guilt about working away from the home? What else is going on here? I\u2019m concerned for both of you.", "Info when's the last time he had a boys night?", "YTA", "YTA. I agree that he should have told you but you seem like you are mad because he wants to watch the game and not because he didn't tell you. Also you highlighted the fact the he would be drinking in the morning. Why is having a drink in the morning once in 4 years such a big deal? Babysitters are expensive but if you spend more than you earn daily only once in a while it won't lead you to bankrupcy. It seems like you never spend money on having fun and that will eventually affect you and your relationship.", "YTA Jesus, he alters his work day around the youngest so you don\u2019t have to pay the extra expense of a daycare. He wants one morning to go do something. Stop being so controlling", "NTA but let him have this. It is a special occasion for soccer fans. Let him have it.", "YTA- sounds like he deserves a break", "YTA. \n\nIf you can afford this, you should just say it\u2019s OK\u2014it IS a special occasion (it only happens once every 4 years, and this is an especially high-profile World Cup, politically and for the soccer world given it\u2019s Messi\u2019s last one and Argentina is in the finals).  And giving your spouse no leeway to unwind without you there is a recipe for disaster.  \n\nUsually I would have said ESH because he should have asked you first, given that your financial decision-making is entirely joint.  But from the sounds of it, you probably left him no opening to ask, because your saying no (unreasonably) was a foregone conclusion.", "YTA. He is your husband, your partner, not your servant. He did not ask you to alter your life in any way, is being responsible and chose a trusted sitter. Stop being jealous that you are not included.", "This IS a special occasion to him and like he said, it\u2019s only a few hours. Also, why shouldn\u2019t he get time off as a work from home parent? I also work retail and my hours suck, so I get that part, but how do you not realize that he\u2019s basically on all the time? YTA for apparently not understanding that.", "YTA- your thought process is absolutely silly. It\u2019s a once every 4 year event and he should be able to enjoy it sans kids if there is an option to do so. \n\nHe can have a life apart from you with friends. It\u2019s extremely unhealthy to not have relationships with friends outside of your spouse IMO especially with him having a WFH job. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad you have to work it but he should be allowed to enjoy it even if you can\u2019t. An underlying feeling of jealousy that he can watch it with friends is how this sounds.", "I\u2019m giving a mild esh but leaning towards YTA. Yes, he should have consulted you first with your shared money. That said, I was expecting this to be one of those stories where he dumped the kids on you or something. He made sure the kids were handled. The World Cup is a big deal and a special occasion. Instead of a date night in the future, compromise and you take a day to yourself for your friends to balance it. He deserves time with his friends and so do you.", "NTA. he can watch it at home with your kids.", "ESH - If he\u2019s spending a couple hundred dollars on a babysitter, he absolutely should have discussed it with you first, just like any other large purchase with a shared account.

A married couple should be able to do things separately. Unless if you guys are so hard up for cash that this will drastically impact your budget, then you are the AH here.

Granted, it is a common courtesy to tell your spouse about your plans but he obviously wasn\u2019t trying to hide it from you if he was talking on the phone about it right in front of you.", "ESH. He should have spoken to you first, for sure, but this is also a bit of a special occasion and I think his ask to go watch it with friends isn't unreasonable. \n\n\nA few hours to enjoy a world-wide sporting event that happens every four years seems like a reasonable expense to me. \n\n\nWould you have been as upset if he asked you first?", "Yta\n\n\nFirst he barely gets time to himself. It's not out of the question if he wants to enjoy something that comes around every 4 years. Your unreasonable. \n\n\nEveryone needs some downtime.\n\n\nHow would you feel if it was something important to you?", "YTA\nFirst thing world cup is actually something that happens once in 4 years so it is a special occasion.\nSecondly special occasion doesn't mean date nights only he should also have time for his friends not only for you \nThe third thing is that he said that it's gonna be for few hours so it's not a long time. \nLet the poor man have some fun", "Yta.  He\u2019s allowed to have interests outside the family.  So are you.  The World Cup only comes around every 4 years.", "YTA. WC happens once every four years. It is a special occasion. And I would consider separating your spending accounts; each getting a sum you can spend on anything, and putting a third sum aside for shared activities/hobbies. Then he can do whatever he likes with the spending money he saved.", "YTA. Thank you though, I screenshotted this to show my husband next time he thinks I\u2019m unnecessarily punitive.", "YTA. FFS, the man gets to have a life outside of you and the kids, especially since he alters his work to watch the youngest. It\u2019s a world sports championship final, not some random game. Cut him some slack.", "YTA I can't imagine a wife who loves there husband would prevent their husband from doing something that is special to him.

But it is a special thing to do with his friends, and just because it isn't special to YOU does not devalue the occasion.", "YTA. He IS being responsible. He has a special event, you're working, so he hired you sitter so that your kids would be safe and looked after, and he can focus on and enjoy his game without distractions. \n\nThis isn't a weekly event, it's a one time event\n\nI fail to see a problem", "YTA. Do you really want to be that kind of unreasonably controlling partner? Let the poor guy see his friends.", "ESH.\n\nOn the one hand, I understand you\u2019re upset that your husband doesn\u2019t go out of his way to get a sitter so the two of you can have a night out all of the time. And, that babysitting costs money.\n\nOn the other hand, the Finals to the World Cup is this weekend, which is a HUGE event (even those who are not interested in sports knows about it). And, depending where you live (I\u2019m guessing North/South America based on the time you said the match starts), the match will be in the morning.\n\nYour husband is one of the few sports fans who was smart enough to find a babysitter for your kids so he can enjoy the match.
