I also have two biological children, Liam (19M) and Jules (17F.) \n\nDanny and Caleb have been with us for about a year and a half. They\u2019re biological siblings who came from a very bad living situation, so there\u2019s a lot of trauma and other things we\u2019ve had to learn how to help with. They\u2019re both doing so much better now and I\u2019m very proud of them.\n\nDanny is extremely protective of Caleb. She\u2019s loosened up quite a bit, but they\u2019re still very close and she still protects him if she feels she has to. When they first came to us, they didn\u2019t want separate bedrooms- Danny absolutely refused to leave Caleb every night. Danny and Caleb have shared the biggest room ever since, and we\u2019ve used the room that was going to be Caleb\u2019s room as an office. Everyone seems fine with this.\n\nRecently, my husband (43M) has brought up to me that he thinks Caleb should move out of Danny\u2019s room. Caleb will be fourteen soon, and in my husband\u2019s own words \u201cteenage boys are gonna do teenage boy things, and teenage girls are gonna do teenage girl things, and they\u2019re both going to need their space.\u201d He brought up that Liam and Jules shared a room when they were younger too, but they got their own rooms when Jules turned ten, and they were both happy about it. \n\nI disagree- while they\u2019ve both made incredible progress, I don\u2019t think Danny is ready for that. From what I understand, she took the brunt of their bad situation in order to protect Caleb, and that\u2019s still affecting how much she protects him now. She\u2019s all right with Caleb being separated from her at school, but she\u2019s with him all the time at home. They do sometimes need space from each other, and that does happen, but the majority of the time they\u2019re in the same room. Caleb is also very attached to Danny, and they both seem perfectly fine sharing their room. I feel like we should bring the idea up to them and ask them if they want to have separate rooms, instead of just deciding that it\u2019s time. My husband disagrees and says that it\u2019s past time and we just need to do it- his idea is to remodel the office room in time for Caleb\u2019s birthday, and have that be his main gift. \n\nMy husband and I have been arguing over this for about a week. He thinks Danny and Caleb need their own rooms, I don\u2019t think Danny is ready for that yet. The kids are both healing well, but they\u2019re just not ready for this step. My husband pointed out yesterday that I may be focusing too much on helping with their trauma instead of trying to help them move past it, and now I can\u2019t help but feel that maybe he\u2019s right. I believe my husband is the asshole for trying to rush the kids into something I don\u2019t think they\u2019re ready for. He believes I\u2019m the asshole for preventing the kids from having their own space and dealing with the past. \n\nSo I\u2019m asking for help here: would I be the asshole for letting Danny and Caleb continue to share their room?", "created_utc": 1680194512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126scvq/wibta_for_letting_my_teenage_kids_keep_sharing/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And you\u2019re doing them both a great disservice by not cutting that unhealthy cord. YTA, but lightly because I\u2019m assuming you either aren\u2019t super trauma informed or CYS and the adoption teams didn\u2019t give you enough resources for these kids to fully thrive. It\u2019s time to start the process no matter how hard and difficult it will be.

You are actively undermining any progress they could make by \u201cforgetting\u201d to bring this up to the therapists. I find this whole thing absurd because out of the 2 dozen placements/foster homes I\u2019ve been in they would never have allowed opposite sex children share a room after 5-6yrs old. They need space, Danny needs to know she isn\u2019t her brothers keeper anymore and she can breath and figure out who she is beyond \u201cmarks mom\u201d and Mark needs to be able to express himself and explore his new life without his sister being hyper vigilant. You cannot let it go on like this. Sincerely I don\u2019t understand how you\u2019ve managed to conveniently never bring up their bedroom sharing situation and separating them to a therapist when her parentification is a huge part of Danny\u2019s trauma.", "NAH. It probably is time but to spring it on someone who already has a lot of trauma and instability seems like a bad idea. Even if you feel strongly it has to happen, you should talk about a transition plan and make sure they know you aren\u2019t trying to separate them, just give them the ability to have space when they need it.\n\nEdited to NAH", "NAH.

Gifts come with an  expectation that the recipient will not only accept what is given, but also *be grateful for and happy about it.*\" You have no reason to believe Caleb (or Danny) will be happy about the separate room, so it would be deeply unfair to them both to set them up pretty much for failure. They would either have to suppress their real feelings to perform gratitude and joy for you, or Caleb's birthday would become an enormous blow-up of trauma and anger. \n\nDefinitely talk with their therapists about it, but also talk to your children.

Make them feel obligated to please you both for fear of consequence rather than go at their own pace? All negatives I grant you, they could he fine. But he's not looking at the bigger picture.
