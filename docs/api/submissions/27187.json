{"id": 27187, "submission_id": "16mpjqt", "title": "AITA for Stopping My Child From Seeing Their Dying Father?", "selftext": "This is a throwaway. \n\nI (58F) have a daughter (34F) 'Mel'. I had her out of wedlock, and it was a very difficult time for me as I was sent away by my family to have her (they wanted me to give her up for adoption, but I kept her). The father (Paul) and I were in an on-off relationship. When Mel was born we lived together for a short while, but ended up breaking up in the 1st year of her life. We (Paul and I) went through some very difficult times and some other things happened I'd rather not talk about here. He wasn't a bad guy at all, just very young and uninterested in being a dad/being committed.\n\nWe both moved on, but didn't really keep in touch regularly. I met someone (John) and married when Mel was 4, and we had three other children. Mel and John have not had a great relationship (he has his own demons and they clashed often), but he provided financially for her. She gets on well with her step-siblings, in fact they are very close. \n\nMel rarely asked about her biological father growing up, and I gave very few details when she did as I thought it was best to leave all that in the past. He did contact me a number of times over the years (either directly or through family), asking if they could meet, but I never thought it was a good idea. As far as I was concerned she had a dad (John), and he had an opportunity to be with us back then and turned it down. Mel did get contacted by a family member of his in her teens, and she came to me to ask if I thought she should meet him, but I told her he was probably just looking for money or something (John is wealthy, Paul is not). She told the family member that she didn't want to meet him.  A few other things happened in her 20s that I'm not proud of, but long story short they never met. \n\nNow on to the AITA. Last year I was contacted by Paul's sister, telling me Paul is dying, and he didn't have long to live. He wanted to know if Mel would meet him, and I told his sister I would ask her. I thought about it a lot and decided that it's best to let sleeping dogs lie, so I never told Mel about the request. I told his sister she wasn't interested in meeting him. He died 2 weeks later. I went to the funeral to pay my respects and when his family asked about Mel I lied and said she didn't want to come. \n\nRecently, a member of Paul's family found Mel on social media and has told her everything. Mel says she never wants to speak to me again, but from my perspective I was just protecting her from pain. Now our whole family is in chaos. \n\nSo, AITA for wanting to keep the past in the past?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1695126228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mpjqt/aita_for_stopping_my_child_from_seeing_their/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know the dude you just described her as not close to? (I assume you think he\u2019s a father figure due to him paying).\n\nBio dad gets in contact\u2026it must be for money? Why would John give him money anyway!? You could have let them have contact and set a boundary of never give him money! \n\nLet me guess, the 20s stuff your embarrassed about is at least partly due to John? \n\nYTA.", "Obviously YTA.  You manipulated your daughter for years into never seeing her biological father, then you lied through your teeth to everyone at the very end to prevent her from having a last chance to reconnect.  Maybe she wouldn't have wanted to see him anyway but you took that choice away from her, and as a 34-year-old, she absolutely had the right to make that choice.  Shame on you.\n\nI don't blame her if she chooses not to see you on your deathbed either.  Imagine that she goes no-contact with you, you manage to reach out to her significant other just a few weeks before you die to ask her to come back, and then they just never tell her?  Wouldn't you hate that circumstance?  Yet you did just that to your daughter.\n\nI don't even know that there's any way you can repair this relationship since you've already gotten what you want, which is to prevent your daughter from ever meeting her father.  You may have irrevocably ruined your relationship with your daughter out of what?  Spite?", "YTA, no question about it. \n\nYou made a decision for her without consulting her. \n\nYou have done irreversible damage. It was her decision to visit him or not, and you stole that opportunity from her. \n\nThis is a heinous act and you never deserve forgiveness for it. It was truly inexcusable what you have done. It was not your choice, but your selfish desire for her not to know her father clouded your judgement. \n\nDeplorable behaviour.", "YTA. It wasn't your decision to make! You weren't protecting a young child from some awful abuser; you stopped a young woman from seeing her dying father. It really seems like maybe you have something to hide and didn't ever want them to meet. I don't blame her for not speaking to you. You took away an opportunity for a connection with her dad and a deeper understanding of her life that she can't ever get back. And, you robbed a man of the chance to know his child throughout her life and that is so selfish that I can hardly wrap my brain around it. Did I say YTA already? Because seriously, you are massively TA.", "YTA. Your daughter is 34 years old already for crying out loud. You are the textbook definition of controlling. I can only hope that your daughter doesn't come back under your thumb.", "YTA. You took away her choice. IMO this is unforgivable.", "YTA\n\nI had to go back and check the age of you daughter expecting it to be like 10. You took away a fully established adults choice forever! You might have had good intentions but it was a terrible choice.", "Yes, yes are, very much so in fact, your daughter is an adult, she had every right to know about that, you've stolen something from her that she can now never have back. Also, your other children are her half siblings not step siblings. YTA", "Oh yes! YTA what is wrong with you. You had issues with her dad so you never allowed her to have any relationship with him and then lied to her at the most pivotal point in their lives. You stole her decisions and left her with nothing but a gaping hole. She was an adult at the time and it was not up to you but you took her choices anyway. \n\nShe does not have a dad. It seems from your post that \u201cJohn\u201d didn\u2019t love her and just provided money. You are selfish and you deserve to lose your daughter.", "Wow yeah, massive YTA. All these things together, especially in light of your mention of various things you 'aren't proud of', that Mel NEVER had a good relationship with John, and your influence convincing her Paul was bad news, paint such a sad picture for how Mel had to grow up. You admit Paul wasn't a bad guy and despite him not living up to your standards as a partner or father, it doesn't sound like he did anything to warrant being frozen out his entire life. You took something from your daughter that she will never get back. And you took an ADULT's decision away from them - your daughter is not a child and she hasn't been for a long, long time. Sadly, you deserve the consequence you are now facing and it's probably best for Mel if she does not allow your influence in her life any longer.", "YTA, massively. You took away your daughters final opportunity to meet her dad and she'll never be able to get that back. You said she doesn't see John as a father, and even if she did, genetic links are so important to our sense of self- this is why we now tell children who have been adopted about their birth parents.\n\nI would find that very hard to forgive, so I think if you want a  relationship with her ongoing you're going to have a lot of apologising and explaining to do.", "What I want to say will get me banned so I\u2019ll just go with YTA.", "YTA", "YTA. She wasn't a child, she should have been given that choice. If you would control this I wonder what else you did to your daughter?", "YTA. That wasn't your call to make and you have no idea what Paul wanted from Mel. You sound incredibly controlling and I feel sorry for your daughter.", "Yes, YTA. It sounds like Mel not meeting Paul was for your convenience. I see a mea culpa in your future if you ever want to have a relationship with your daughter in the future.", "YTA big time. Mel is an adult. You are making major life decisions for her behind her back. No matter how pure your motivations are (and I suspect they are not) you do not have the right to do that. The fact that you are upset by her reaction and see no problem with your actions is a further black mark against you. Selfish is the word that comes to mind. Don't be surprised if she cuts you off completely. There would be a certain poetic justice to it if she did.", "YTA - That was beyond asshole behavior. That was monstrous. You did not have the right to make that decision for Mel. I don't even know where to start listing how selfish and petty you are.", "YTA. \n\nYou denied her the ability to make that choice for herself. \n\nYou denied her the opportunity to talk with him, to spend time and say goodbye. She might have wanted to resolve some issues she might have with had him, or questions she wanted to ask. Now for her it's unresolved. \n\nIt was selfish of you to take the opportunity to go to the funeral and pay respects.\nUnderstand that you wanted to close that chapter of your life, however lying to them about your daughter not wanting to be there, you know that it would have hurt them to hear that. \nI would hope you wouldn't sink to sabotaging those familial ties so they wouldn't reach out to your daughter. \n\nYou have to apologise.\nShe is justifiably angry and hurt, leave her be and let her contact you if/when she is ever ready.", "you have no idea what you deprived your daughter of. you are evil to the core. YTA", "YTGiantA.  You removed any opportunity for your daughter to meet her dad.  You did not have the right to make that choice for her, and it can never be unmade.", "YTA for sure you definitely tried to paint this in a better light for yourself by trying to act nonchalant and it did not work lol.  You are absolutely in the wrong here you didn\u2019t want to pass the message along for selfish reasons and I have a very very VERY strong opinion that if your daughter wrote her side it would be a different story, only thing that would stay the same is your a crap mom lol", "YTA, big time. Your daughter is an adult and you yourself said that Paul wasn\u2019t a bad man AND that she doesn\u2019t have a great relationship with her step-father. Unless Paul was somehow abusive or otherwise toxic, you had no valid reason to keep him away from his daughter and doing so was incredibly selfish. We\u2019re clearly missing a big part of the picture both with what happened with Paul in the past and the other things you\u2019re \u201cnot proud of\u201d from your daughter\u2019s late 20s, but I suspect it makes your motive much more clear. This is just so selfish I can\u2019t wrap my head around it. I don\u2019t blame her one bit for wanting to go NC.", "YTA. \n\nYou stole her opportunity to get to know her bio dad and now she never will. I have no words for it. It\u2019s unforgivable. \n\nApart from the appalling things you admit to in your post, you also hint at more things/incidents that you conveniently gloss over. Makes me think there is more important context, but even without that your behaviour is cartoonishly evil.\n\nYou weren\u2019t trying to protect her. There was no danger to protect her from, so you can drop that justification. \n\nI understand why she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you again. You robbed her of meeting her dad because it might have inconvenienced you.", "YTA\nBut you already know this.  You are bitter and spiteful and controlling. You are awful.  What a terrible thing to do to your child and she wasn't even given the opportunity to meet her dad as an adult because somehow you thought you knew best.  With this attitude, good luck with the reat of your kids. I'm glad Mel is out from under your thumb now. Just wow.", "YTA.  You protect minor children.  Adult children are given a choice to make their own decisions.  Because they are adults. \n\nYou took your issues with Paul and tried to control Mel\u2019s contact with him because of them. You lied to your child and you betrayed her.  And you took away her last chance to ever see her father again, or at least decide what she wanted to do.  I cannot even believe you didn\u2019t even tell her when he died and you went to the funeral secretly.  \n\nYou say you wanted to keep the past in the past - but you only get to make that decision for yourself. You don\u2019t get to make it for your adult daughter.", "YTA. You daughter is older than you were when you had her. She is grown and has her own decisions to make. Who knows the last time you made a good decision, yet you want to perpetuate your bad choices on to her. You're horrible for keeping this information from her, lying to people on her behalf and now being shocked that she wants nothing to do with you. And had the nerve to go to the funeral to pay your respects? You don't respect anyone and only think about yourself.\n\nI hope she goes through with it and cuts you off permanently.", "Wow. YTA and a colossal one.\n\nYou punished your daughter and her father cause he didn't want to be with you.\n\"As far as I was concerned she had a dad (John), and he had an opportunity to be with us back then and turned it down\"\n\nYour daughter didn't have a great relationship with your husband and you ensured that she never had one with her father. You lied time and time again to do that. You are evil. She should never forgive you if she has any sense.", "Your backstory, YTA. \n\nYour situation, YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing if bio dad was a known abuser (DV and pedofile etc) and say he was dying and your daughter was under 18, but given all the other details you gave, I am going to assume that was not the situation AND your daughter is now 34. \n\nYTA for going out of your way to keep you daughter separated from her bio dad. Based on the picture you painted, it seems like bio dad and family tried to be respectful in asking you if they could meet Mel, and you intentionally sabotaged this. Time passes, and then they ask her directly, and she having no reference that there had been multiple attempts made for contact, and then comes to you for advice, only to be sabotaged further. \n\nAnd then you had the nerve to attend the funeral and lie to bio dad\u2019s family. Protecting her from pain is such a sad excuse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
