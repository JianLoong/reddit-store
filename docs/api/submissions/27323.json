My (step)daughter Ava (6). She\u2019s with us about 75% of the time. My sister Kat and Kat\u2019s daughter Mae (8) \n\nKat was in a bad car accident recently & has a few months of recovery ahead of her. She\u2019s mostly bed bound at the moment but she is home and expected to make a full recovery. Her boyfriend is taking care of her but it\u2019s a newish relationship and everyone felt more comfortable if Mae stayed with my parents until Kat was at least independently mobile & because of their schedule, I will end up taking Mae on Saturdays and occasional Sundays.\n\nI feel Kat is too permissive with Mae & it\u2019s led to her being spoiled. She\u2019s not too bad, she is a sweet kid but she\u2019s also very entitled & a strong believer of \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine & what\u2019s yours is also mine\u201d and tends to get pushy & mean if she doesn\u2019t get her way. \n\nThe girls have known each other for over half their lives by now & I\u2019ve seen this play out over and over before. They get along well most of the time and Ava has been very good about sharing her things but gets frustrated when Mae brings her Switch or American girl doll over and then doesn\u2019t let her play so she in turn refuses to share too & then Mae has a fit. This has become more frequent (since before the accident). Kat\u2019s always said \u201cwell she doesn\u2019t have to share her things\u201d and sure but neither does Ava & we\u2019ve all seen what happens when she doesn\u2019t. And Kat dismisses it every time. Of course Ava doesn\u2019t want to share when that happens, she\u2019s old enough to see that Mae isn\u2019t fair to her but she can\u2019t understand why.\n\nI knew this would be a problem between them if Mae brought over any of her special items but Ava is fine sharing when Mae isn\u2019t dangling something in front of her. So Dan & I prevented it. She just isn\u2019t allowed to bring toys or electronics over at all. \n\nMy parents mentioned it & Kat is furious and has been calling to tell me how unfair we are, that we\u2019re punishing her daughter for not letting people walk all over her and that I was undermining her lessons on being \u201cassertive\u201d. She said she didn\u2019t spend her money on things for other kids to play with & that I wasn\u2019t a real mom so I couldn\u2019t understand. I got upset & told her that if she wasn\u2019t going to teach her kid to treat others the way she insisted on being treated, then this is what it had to be. Ava\u2019s feelings matter too & this will eventually sour their whole relationship. And we\u2019re trying to mitigate that until she does her fking job.\n\nWe kept arguing and I told her that if she had a problem with my rules, she could come over and do something about it (which\u2026 she can\u2019t) or she could stfu. And then we ended up just yelling & calling each other names until I hung up.\n\nI\u2019m still mad & obviously Dan agrees with me but my mom is guilting me about stressing Kat while she\u2019s recovering & essentially calling her a bad mother & Kat definitely called me worse things than an AH so I\u2019m curious what the objective opinion is", "created_utc": 1695298096, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16oe6pf/aita_for_not_allowing_my_niece_to_bring_any_of/", "score": 1976, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because you didn't give birth to Ava doesn't mean you aren't a mother to her. This comment would have been followed up with my saying \"well, since I'm not a real mom I guess I can no longer watch Mae as I  obviously don't know what I'm doing and therefore it's too dangerous for her to be in my care.\" It was a vile thing to say. \n\nSecond, you are not required to cater to entitled behavior. It's your home, your rules. Tell Kat that your lessons on \"the world doesn't care about what you want\" are just as important and that every has to learn they dont always get their way. \n\nThere is a difference in teaching your child to be assertive and to not let people walk all over you, and raising a child to be an entitled bully. \n\nYou've set your boundaries. You have nothing to feel guilty about.", "Arguing and name calling aside, I think your approach on the toys was a good one. What kind of mom teaches their kid it\u2019s ok to not share? NTA", "NTA. Your sister is teaching her daughter to be a mean bully.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. If Kat doesn't like it she can find alternative free child care.", "Nope, NTA\n\nYour approach seems reasonable. \n\nKat does come off as a bad mother, and just doesn\u2019t like being called out for it. \n\nThe kid can gain some lessons while spending time at your place.", "You sound EXACTLY  like a 'real' mother should. How dare your sister expect you to care for her child and yet expect you to placidly accept her refusing to play nice with your daughter. If she doesn't like you actually parenting her child better than she does, tell her to find a child minder instead. What a damn cheek!\n\nNTA all the way", "NTA Your house, your rules.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t like it, she can another free babysitter", "WTF?  So Mae must share all of her possessions, but Ava doesn't have to share anything? And your sister calls that teaching her to be \"assertive?\"  She's not teaching Ava to be assertive, she's teaching her to be greedy and a bully.  I would go as far as to say that Mae doesn't have to share anything with Ava and if Ava has a fit, Ava can learn what \"time outs\" are.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nMae is older than Ava which is why she's been able to get away with what she's been doing.  But now Ava has wised up to the inequality of it.\n\nKat doesn't have the right to tell you what to do in your home.  The only other alternative is for Mae to only play with the toys she brings to the house and not let Ava touch them, and Ava to only play with her toys and not let Mae touch them.  But that's not great either.  Mae does need a good dose of reality but no one is going to like the outcome and it will all be seen as your fault.\n\nKat may be injured and everyone is doing her a great big favour by looking after her child.  She should be grateful.  You're help your mom out by taking Mae for a day or two on the weekend.. your mother should be grateful for that.  Your other option is to take Mae out for a couple of hours on the weekend instead and go somewhere where no one plays with each others toys... like the library or the park.\n\nIt's also a case of E S H when it comes to the phone call between you and your sister.  Both behaved badly but Kat started it.", "NTA\n\nYour house. Your rules. Mae is old enough to get that. Kat should be mature enough, too.", "NTA. \n\nYou have limited options in this situation - you could let Mae run things her way, which is unfair to your daughter. You could ban Mae from your house altogether, which seems a bit of an overreaction, or you could do exactly what you've done - remove the problem (the toys she refuses to share) from your house, which at the very worst means Mae has to do without for a short period of time.  That's the best option available to you and it seems to work.\n\nDoes Mae drag her things to school with her? Probably not. She's more than capable of leaving personal items at home. \n\nKat is out of line for trying to set rules in your house.  She's also quite the AH for claiming she's teaching her daughter to be \"assertive\" - \"assertive\" is only a positive if it's done with mutual respect (that is, not backing down from her boundaries, but also not overstepping others' boundaries).   Kat's comment that you're \"not a real mom\" was a complete AH comment.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you sunk to her level in the yelling and name calling, but there's nothing to be done for that now. For that part, you were both AHs, I'm sure, but given everything else the balance of assholosity falls on Kat.", "You're NTA and I would have added that Ava gets to choose to be assertive with her own things as Mae does. If Mae chooses to stomp on Ava's boundaries then you'll do what Kat does as a \"real mother\" since she believes she's so right, and you will protect Ava's \"right to be assertive\" the same way Kat does by not tolerating Mae's outbursts when you prevent Mae from boundary-stomping Ava. Just like what you learned from Kat a \"real mother\" would do. Use her own logic against her. Tell her you're teaching Ava to be assertive just like Mae and if Kat doesn't like that then you can tell Kat that you're just learning from the best real mother you know. You can also take it as an opportunity to suggest that if there's another way of teaching Ava to be assertive that Kat likes better, maybe she can try that avenue of teaching on Mae first so you can see how it's done by a \"real\" expert. \n\nAfter all, in reinforcing assertiveness in Ava, you're just doing what Kat says a real mother would do. Corner her with that. Tell her you think she's right when it comes to teaching a little girl to protect her boundaries, that her approach to doing that is something any little girl would benefit from. And also ask her what she would do if Mae was \"being assertive\" and the other kid loses their mind over it. Ask her if she would be okay with Ava behaving like a little monster to Mae when all Mae was doing was being assertive. Ask her if she thinks Mae should have to put up with it. If she (likely) says that Mae shouldn't have to. Then tell her you appreciate her real mother advice in confirming that Ava shouldn't have to put up with it either when she's asserting her own boundaries. \n\nIf she pulls the \"well that's different\" card, ask her to explain to you exactly how it is different. She won't be able to. \n\nAnd finally, tell her that you're going to use Kat's real mother methodology on Ava and that it's doubly important for a little girl to feel she can be assertive in her own home, her safe space where it is entirely up to her to exercise expressing what she is and is not comfortable with. After all, you've seen her teach Mae that so Kat MUST be right and that's some great \"real mother\" advice you'll happily take her up on.", "NTA\n\nYour house, your rules and let's be honest.. Your rules are fine. If Ava needs to share her toys then Mae should also share hers when she is at your house.", "NTA.\n\nFlash news: Kat can keep her daughter home with herself and pay a babysitter. I assure you many parents with kids do not have family stepping up when they have incidents.\n\nShe isn\u2019t teaching her daughter to be assertive, she is teaching her to be spoiled. I\u2019m against the sharing is caring and forcing kid to share, so we teach that she can share or not and so can others. We didn\u2019t have any tantrum so that means that what you sister is doing is way different.", "NTA\n\nYou are a mom and I don't think your sister who clearly doesn't have good parenting skills should have any opinion on that.", "NTA. Not sharing prized items is a good thing to teach kids, but it's also important to teach them not to lord those possessions over other children. It's a delicate balance that I feel OP is navigating quite well. Kat should be grateful for the free childcare.", "NTA. Stop taking Mae on the weekend. They don't want to teach her to share or that she can't be selfish with other people's stuff. You don't like the lesson your daughter is learning when Mae is there. Time for them to find other arrangements for the weekend.", "NTA - your sister is ruining her daughter", "NTA. Neither of you are bad parents, you just have different styles. The kicker is that the lessons you (and Kat) think you are teaching are NOT necessarily the lessons that the children take away from it, because kids do NOT think like adults, do not comprehend adult concepts and will put their own interpretation on the lesson. You can raise two kids identically and they will turn out completely different because they have their own thought process and life experiences.  Maybe you think you are teaching 'sharing' but your child might only be complying in the moment because YOU are making her, when deep down she doesn't like it, and in the years to come she didn't absorb/learn any of the complex reasoning behind the concept, so she turns out 'selfish'.    You can only do your 'best' as a parent, and HOPE that your lessons coupled with the child's own thinking/personality and life experiences will lead to her best life.   In this case, your daughter may be learning what 'Not Sharing' feels like, and that might be the better lesson on '*why*' she should share than you just saying the words. Just something to consider.   Bottom line: your house, your rules, so NTA.", "ESH\n\nYou are awful free with your opinions about how your sister parents her child. How about you handle your own. Your sister is teaching Ava that she has agency about her own things. You are focusing on teaching your daughter to share her things. These are valid differing parenting perspectives. Just because your sister is not on yours doesn't make her a bad mother.\n\nYou parent your kid while following your sister's rule for Ava. Either tell your own daughter that she must share regardless of the fairness or let he decline sharing. If Ava becomes mean, you separate them and handle the behavior like an adult caretaker. The place Kat gets share of the blame is not adequately disciplining for her daughter not taking \"no\" for an answer. Your focus really should be there.  \"When my daughter exerts the same rights of ownership over her own property that you teach Ava, Ava engages in unacceptable behavior.\"", " .  ,\u00e1a               ,  ,    ,  ,,,,,,,", "ESH\n\nDid you actually tell your sister to \u201ccome over & do something about it\u201d? Were you planning to fight her? Wow! \n\nSeems neither of these kids have very good role models.", "ESH: I don\u2019t agree with the not sharing, but I also don\u2019t agree with you punishing someone else\u2019s child. \n\nHave you ever seen how Mae interacts with other children? Curious if it\u2019s a not sharing with anyone thing or if it is specific to your stepdaughter because she isn\u2019t comfortable with you.", "YTA\n\nThe toys an active six year old can enjoy are quite different from what works for an eight year old who is essentially bed-bound while recovering from a car accident.\n\nA Switch is expensive, and easy to break.  It is also something your niece can play with while lying in bed, or propped up on the sofa and unable to move much. Likewise with carrying a favorite doll to cuddle.  \n\nYou worry about developing generosity and empathy in the children?  Now is the time to work with your daughter about understanding when someone is sick or injured, bedbound, and in a lot of pain.\n\nYour sister is right that she did not buy those toys to share.  Your sister is likely facing considerable medical bills for your niece.  And she's probably also had to make an effort to find and afford a few things that your niece can enjoy in her current state.\n\nYour daughter probably would not damage the switch or the doll on purpose.  But six year olds aren't always careful.  If your niece were to share these toys, and your daughter broke them, could you afford to buy replacements?\n\nAnd your niece also knows that if she shares her toys with your daughter, and your daughter carries it out of her reach while playing, your niece can't just go and pick it up when she wants to use it.  She's bed-bound, and if a toy is moved out of her reach, it might as well be on the far side of the moon.  The things she cares about and enjoy need to stay within easy reach.\n\nYour niece is not \"spoiled.\"  She's injured, and (hopefully only temporarily) disabled, and she's working to figure out how to live in this condition.\n\nYou might consider getting one of those adjustable bed tables on wheels like they use in hospital rooms.  And a few age-appropriate games for six and eight year olds to play together.  Make those \"special games for when your cousin visits\" and the two girls can probably both be on the bed, and play a game together on the bed-table.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I might suggest telling Mae (and letting mom know this is the way it will be in your home if she wants your help) that the rule is if she brings a toy over, she needs to take turns. If she does not, the toy goes away for a while. If she continues to not learn, the toy doesn't come over.

This doesn\u2019t seem a little extreme to you?\n\nI think it would honestly be perfectly fine to sit Ava down and say, \u201chey, I know your cousin is not very good at sharing. While ideally you would want to share with guests, because that is nice and you know from experience that it feels bad when someone doesn\u2019t want to share with you, it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to share with Mae anymore.\u201d Because, guess what? Mae does not _have to_ share, nobody _has to_ share. So it\u2019s okay to teach Ava to set her own boundary of not having to share if someone is also choosing not to share. This is more helpful as a life lesson, since mom and dad will not always be able to force a sharing situation.\n\nThen you don\u2019t have to ban a child from bringing their own toys and comfort items with them, and you don\u2019t have to force your child to share with someone who is anti-sharing. OP seems to be manipulating this situation mostly so her daughter feels good about sharing, and is punishing Mae in the process. This is deeply weird.\n\nETA: also, just let Mae have her fits about Ava not sharing.

I'm a daycare teacher often in the 4 year old room. It is something we work on with the kids. Because we do have kids who only like to mess things up. No one wants to play with them because they are working hard on their legos, puzzle etc. We teach them to use their words and say no I don't want to play. Because it isn't really fair to force kids to share and play with a child who is a bully. All that does is teach kids to let bullies step all over them. The only time I enforce sharing is if the kid is in a center (cars, big blocks, house center). But if they are playing with a table top/looking at a book. Than they can play on their own.", "On the flip side, forcing your children to share things they're really attached to can lead to possessiveness and anxiety. My mom regularly went through our things while we were at our grandparents' without any notice, taking whatever she decided we didn't need, and gave them away to families she seemed less fortunate. She also let her friends' kids and my sister destroy my things constantly and if I got upset I was lectured about being selfish; I'm pretty sure I got spanked for not wanting to put my school supplies in the collective pile for redistribution. I'm 26 years old and it still hurts to think of certain things like one of my favorite movies being given away with no notice or a bookmark that came with my favorite book being chewed up by her friend's baby.\n\nNow I'm very selective with those I share things with and have an extremely short fuse when I feel like people are trying to take my stuff.", "Me.\n\nSharing is caring, but not always. If you don't want to share certain things, fine. But either leave them in your room or don't take them out with you.\n\nYou *are* allowed to have special things.

The problem here isn\u2019t that she\u2019s teaching her kid they don\u2019t have to share, the problem here is that she\u2019s not teaching her kid that other kids don\u2019t have to share either.", "I taught my kids this, sharing is not mandatory but that goes both ways. You don't have to share with them, but then they also don't have to share with you. And on top of that the repercussions choosing not to share  shouldn't come as a surprise. So occasionally my one kid will get a new special thing, and choose to not share it for that reason. But because they know that long term withholding or choosing not to share over and over and over can hurt feelings and in the long run make toys less fun for them when no one wants to play with them they choose to share more often than not.\n\nEdit to add op is NTA here at all though", "What the mom should teach the kid is that the kid shouldn\u2019t bring toys they\u2019re unwilling to share to a play date.

Mae is allowed to play with Ava's toys here, there is nothing unfair about the arrangement.

(In which case they can just share Ava\u2019s toys) Punish the 6 yo because the 8 yo is obnoxious?", "Now because the niece is over there a lot more and will continue to be so the problem needed to be addressed now.", "Why would she do this? Her child shares fine the niece is the problem.", "It\u2019s not her job to teach someone  else\u2019s child to share. And would be overstepping since Mae\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t want her to learn to share. \n\nAlso she is in no way obligated to watch her niece multiple days a week. I would just say it\u2019s my rules or she can\u2019t be in my house without a parent present.", "Jeez, Kat. Maybe if you were trying to raise a kind and thoughtful human, you would feel differently.", "Reading is SO fundamental.", "to be fair, not all kids are social butterflies.  My daughter was an only child for me, and i learned with her that if we were spending a large amount of time with another kid that having them all separate after a while to do a solo activity for a bit helped keep the peace.  (Visiting family, a sleepover, etc)", "You don't bring toys to someone else's house that you are not willing to share", "The whole post is because Mae is being bratty. She wants to play with her toys and her cousins toys but refuses to share. She even throws tantrums when she doesn\u2019t get to play with what she wants. Tough circumstances need to be met with understanding but not freedom of consequences or we\u2019d all be doing horrible things to each other under the excuse of \u201cI\u2019m going through something difficult right now\u201d", "A Switch is very commonly used like a personal device, like a cell phone or a laptop. It's designed to be played like a handheld device, like a DS or Gameboy or PSP, etc. The standard carrying case is small and doesn't have room for extra controllers, which would have to be bought separately. It's not something that adult players usually share with each other, as it has personal save data and access to your Nintendo account for purchases. When my friends and family play games together, we each have own Switch and don't ever touch each others. Most of the games I play are only even multiplayer when everyone playing has a separate Switch. It's not like she's lugging a PS5 over to their house and hooking it up to their TV and then refusing to let the other kid use a controller. It's more like not wanting to hand over a DS so that another kid can save over her game data. A 6 year old seems like they would be at higher risk of breaking a small device like that as well. \n\nAdults commonly take Switches on public transportation and such to kill time, and no one thinks it's rude that they aren't passing them around to let other people play them too. Adults don't go over to their friend's houses and hand their cellphones over so people can play mobile games on them, they don't feel obligated to hand their laptops or tablets over either. It doesn't make any sense that kids should be expected to do these things, especially when it greatly increases the chance that devices could get broken or their save data erased or corrupted. \n\nBeing able to share is very important, but the two items given as examples in this post are not ones that are actually commonly shared. A Switch is a personal device that shouldn't be passed around, and it's good practice to teach kids to be mindful of electronics and their data. The doll sounds like it's sentimental. I can see not wanting Mae to bring these items out if the other girl doesn't have her own so they can play together with them, but there isn't anything wrong with her having them in her bag and being able to use them during times when she's playing alone.", "And the only parenting issue OP has voiced an opinion in is one that directly affects her and her daughter. That\u2019s fair.", "I agree but removing an object of conflict really isn\u2019t punishment.", "We\u2019re on the same page. But I don\u2019t see OP\u2019s action as a consequence to Mae\u2019a action. It\u2019s a consequence of the mom\u2019s action. This kid needs a break right now. Not a \u201clife lesson\u201d from a know-it-all aunt.", "We had Tonka trucks and Lawn Darts.", "I didn\u2019t know it was acceptable to be an ass if life was difficult. Is that what we teach children now? \n\nIf the switch and Mae\u2019s other toys cause fights it\u2019s completely logical to remove them from the equation. It\u2019s not an attempt to teach a life lesson it was a necessary step to make watching her niece bearable not only for OP but for her daughter."]}
