They got serious and he told everyone. I thought it was 10 years different at most. She seemed really mature, and like she had her life together\n\nI tried to get to know his new gf, help her learn more about my dad But things started getting worse. New gf moved in three months later, they were engaged \n\nHis gf and I started to not get along. She was always telling me what to do and how to do things. I thought she was just being weird in new situations. She seemed nice, and my dad really liked her. Plus, I thought she might genuinely have life experience I didn't \n\nThen it got even worse She started acting like a brat. She was trying to get me to move across the country for college even though I had a full ride to the university down the street. She started \"forgetting\" to tell me when they would be out for dinner so I'd make too much food or not make food at all. She told me to sell my car, quit my job, said I didn't do enough around the house. If I was home, I was home too often, and if I was out, I was out too late. She would barge into my room. She made my friends feel unwelcome. She convinced my dad to sell the house and buy a smaller one, convenient since I had just turned 18 and they could kick me out without legal issues (my dad said this isn't his plan, but I know it's hers) Then I found out she's badmouthing me to my aunt Saying I didn't understand how to live like an adult and I was lazy (I'm a straight-A student and an athlete with a full-time job)\n\nI tried to brush it off. We don't get along, that's fine, as long as my dad is happy. But then I found out she's only two years older than me. So while she was acting high and mighty like the second coming of Jesus, she was literally two years older. We went to high school together. I have friends in her graduating class \n\nI tried to talk to my dad about it: I felt like she was overbearing, she was making me feel unwelcome, she was pulling him away from me when the two of us used to be close. He brushed it all off We've been having this argument for a year. When I brought up that she's not much older than me and she has no right to tell me to do things he got defensive and said her age was none of my business\n\nSo now it's creepy as hell that he's dating someone two years older than his child and that person is also the devil I don't know if this is a midlife crisis or something but literally everyone hates this woman He's marrying her anyway Half our family isn't coming to the wedding He is driving away everyone for this woman \n\nMy friends were joking about how I should get a date with someone his age and see how he reacts. He has always told me not to date anyone much older than me. It was a joke, but now I'm considering it. I will do whatever it takes to get this woman as far away from my dad as possible, even if it means pointing out how creepy he looks \n\nWould I be the asshole?", "created_utc": 1683434037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13acv2v/wibta_for_pointing_out_how_creepy_my_dad_is/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He left my mom and in the matter of 3 weeks was dating the bartender at his favorite tavern. He was 44 and she was 22 I was 19 at the time. I bit my lip and put up with it for as long as I could.

Congrats on your full ride to the university.. that\u2019s major!!! You seem like a smart person and like you have a bright future ahead of you. \n\nI support your plan to get rid of her, because she doesn\u2019t sound like a healthy person to live with either way. But keep in mind if you go forth with the fake date just to get a rise out of dad.. his gf will have an opening to point out how immature that was\u2026 My best advice for you would to try and schedule some proper father son time. No girls allowed. Bonus points for if it\u2019s something you A. Haven\u2019t done in a while or B.) know it\u2019s something he\u2019s been wanting you to do together. Don\u2019t bring up the gf at all, pretend as if you barely notice she exists. But say you really had a blast just you and him and should have guy days a lot. \n\nPlant positive little seeds. Give them time and water them with quality time and I promise they\u2019ll grow.", "Doesn't matter if you'd be TA, he is thinking with his dick, you won't succeed.

You can't randomly try to woo someone to prove a point to your Dad. Also if you just go for anyone, that would be unsafe.\n\nBut I feel your pain. My father is a genuine creeper. His ex wife after my mother was five years older than me. His new wife is a year younger than me (and I'm his third child).\n\nYour Dad is an AH for letting some random kid treat his child like crap. Your Dad's gf is obviously a massive AH in every single way.\n\nCurrently you're NTA at all. And you won't become one unless you toy with some poor randoms feels to prove a point to your Dad lol.\n\nBut yeah, NTA.", ".......yo this is fucked up haha.\n\nSorry OP, NTA, but um.... hmmm.\n\nStrong \"ick\". \n\nI don't even have any advice.

In any case, Dad is **way** creepy for this relationship.", "I\u2019d suggest if you really want to do this, you should just pretend about the date, so you don\u2019t have to deal with the creepiness that tends to come when someone wants to date someone that much younger.  The last thing you need is more creepiness and imposition and attempts at control in your life.  It can mess with you more than you expect, even when it\u2019s only a brief thing you\u2019re not that into - I watched a friend go through that at a little older than you, and it really messed with him.  Turned into stalking after he tried to break it off, and since he was gay and closeted, it was really hard for him to get it taken care of without pulling his sexuality out into the open (this was a bit over 20 years ago and he wanted to teach, so I think there were maybe a dozen people he was out to).", "It would be hilarious and justified if you found a 40 year old guy to go on a few dates just to blow ur dad's mind.", "If you don\u2019t like it, then move out.

However I don\u2019t expect it to work, he knows it\u2019s gross and wrong that\u2019s why he hid it.

Dont point out your dads poor judgement, that will never go down well. Always try to be the bigger person, rise above it. I get the comment about getting an older gf, but whats the point? You will go to that effort for a joke with a jab\u2026?", "The predator father is the biggest asshole here. And he kept the relationship hidden for awhile?! How long, EXACTLY?! Was she even legal when they first started dating?! She's 20 now, so she was a teenager when they started seeing each other.\n\nYeah, the fiance sounds absolutely insufferable. But she's basically just a kid on a power trip, not surprising considering the absurd situation she's in.\n\nThe solution isn't to try and mend the relationship with his father, in my opinion, but rather to start making plans on future living arrangements to get away him (and his soon-to-be childish bride).", "I concur. \n\nI'm sorry to say your father looks like a lecherous predator to me. \n\nEven when he went public with the relationship, he let you think the age gap was 10 years, instead of the full 24 (geez he was older than either of you are now when you were born).\nHe knows you earned a scholarship for a university nearby, but still bought a smaller house. Is there even a space for you there? Enough space for you to be comfortable as a student (that's not just doing the reading and studying and sometimes cramming all night, there's also a social element, coming home late, having friends over)? \n\nI agree with Crone: focus on your own plans. Where could you hang with your friends if they're no longer comfortable around your dad and his fianc\u00e9e? If your space in the new small house is insufficient, what can you figure out once uni starts? A library maybe? Do you have good transport to get there and back? Will it be reliable during winter days when it's cold and raining and dark after 17 h p.m.? If you're never allowed to host a pre-party or a study group or a practice session for a presentation you have to give as a group, how will you deal with that? Confide in friends? What about randomly assigned group members you don't know beyond class? Could you figure out how to be a great guest, so the others don't mind you never take a turn hosting?\n\nImo that'll set your mind at ease.\nAdded bonus: I think it'll give you a lot of actual life experience about how to be gracious and mature... and isn't that the best way to subtly rub it in their faces?", "If I did do it, the person would absolutely know they were involved. I wouldn't just pick someone up off the street I promise.", "Her parents are obsessed with my dad.

That's a shitty situation.", "The parents being obsessed with your dad is almost weirder than his relationship with their daughter. Is he really rich or something?", "I'm so sorry. It looks like your relationship with your dad is being destroyed by her, and quite intentionally. She's eventually going to have kids, and she probably doesn't want you there competing with the new kids for your dad's affection. Maybe just cut your losses now. It's hard because like you said you and Dad used to be close. Definitely have a long talk with just him though. You need to say things to him that she doesn't need to hear.", "Just because I fucked your mom doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m your father.
