They got serious and he told everyone. I thought it was 10 years different at most.

New gf moved in three months later, they were engaged \n\nHis gf and I started to not get along. She was always telling me what to do and how to do things. I thought she was just being weird in new situations. She seemed nice, and my dad really liked her. Plus, I thought she might genuinely have life experience I didn't \n\nThen it got even worse She started acting like a brat. She was trying to get me to move across the country for college even though I had a full ride to the university down the street. She started \"forgetting\" to tell me when they would be out for dinner so I'd make too much food or not make food at all. She told me to sell my car, quit my job, said I didn't do enough around the house. If I was home, I was home too often, and if I was out, I was out too late. She would barge into my room. She made my friends feel unwelcome. She convinced my dad to sell the house and buy a smaller one, convenient since I had just turned 18 and they could kick me out without legal issues (my dad said this isn't his plan, but I know it's hers) Then I found out she's badmouthing me to my aunt Saying I didn't understand how to live like an adult and I was lazy (I'm a straight-A student and an athlete with a full-time job)\n\nI tried to brush it off. We don't get along, that's fine, as long as my dad is happy. But then I found out she's only two years older than me. So while she was acting high and mighty like the second coming of Jesus, she was literally two years older. We went to high school together. I have friends in her graduating class \n\nI tried to talk to my dad about it: I felt like she was overbearing, she was making me feel unwelcome, she was pulling him away from me when the two of us used to be close. He brushed it all off We've been having this argument for a year. When I brought up that she's not much older than me and she has no right to tell me to do things he got defensive and said her age was none of my business\n\nSo now it's creepy as hell that he's dating someone two years older than his child and that person is also the devil I don't know if this is a midlife crisis or something but literally everyone hates this woman He's marrying her anyway Half our family isn't coming to the wedding He is driving away everyone for this woman \n\nMy friends were joking about how I should get a date with someone his age and see how he reacts. He has always told me not to date anyone much older than me. It was a joke, but now I'm considering it. I will do whatever it takes to get this woman as far away from my dad as possible, even if it means pointing out how creepy he looks \n\nWould I be the asshole?", "created_utc": 1683434037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13acv2v/wibta_for_pointing_out_how_creepy_my_dad_is/", "score": 206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His ex wife after my mother was five years older than me. His new wife is a year younger than me (and I'm his third child).\n\nYour Dad is an AH for letting some random kid treat his child like crap.

The last thing you need is more creepiness and imposition and attempts at control in your life.

Dont point out your dads poor judgement, that will never go down well. Always try to be the bigger person, rise above it. I get the comment about getting an older gf, but whats the point? You will go to that effort for a joke with a jab\u2026?", "The predator father is the biggest asshole here. And he kept the relationship hidden for awhile?! How long, EXACTLY?! Was she even legal when they first started dating?! She's 20 now, so she was a teenager when they started seeing each other.\n\nYeah, the fiance sounds absolutely insufferable. But she's basically just a kid on a power trip, not surprising considering the absurd situation she's in.\n\nThe solution isn't to try and mend the relationship with his father, in my opinion, but rather to start making plans on future living arrangements to get away him (and his soon-to-be childish bride).", "I concur. \n\nI'm sorry to say your father looks like a lecherous predator to me. \n\nEven when he went public with the relationship, he let you think the age gap was 10 years, instead of the full 24 (geez he was older than either of you are now when you were born).\nHe knows you earned a scholarship for a university nearby, but still bought a smaller house. Is there even a space for you there? Enough space for you to be comfortable as a student (that's not just doing the reading and studying and sometimes cramming all night, there's also a social element, coming home late, having friends over)? \n\nI agree with Crone: focus on your own plans. Where could you hang with your friends if they're no longer comfortable around your dad and his fianc\u00e9e? If your space in the new small house is insufficient, what can you figure out once uni starts? A library maybe? Do you have good transport to get there and back? Will it be reliable during winter days when it's cold and raining and dark after 17 h p.m.? If you're never allowed to host a pre-party or a study group or a practice session for a presentation you have to give as a group, how will you deal with that? Confide in friends? What about randomly assigned group members you don't know beyond class? Could you figure out how to be a great guest, so the others don't mind you never take a turn hosting?\n\nImo that'll set your mind at ease.\nAdded bonus: I think it'll give you a lot of actual life experience about how to be gracious and mature... and isn't that the best way to subtly rub it in their faces?", "If I did do it, the person would absolutely know they were involved.

That's a shitty situation.", "The parents being obsessed with your dad is almost weirder than his relationship with their daughter. Is he really rich or something?", "I'm so sorry.

Someone needs to give him a wake up call. Can you get other family members together to reinforce this with you? I'm sorry you're having to deal with this, it's horrible\n\nWhat's more creepy even still is she's jealous of you. That's why she wants you out of the house and across the country. It's terrible and unbelievable but it happens. You might want to also bring that up, if you think it might help him realize. Honestly, your dad's behavior is at least borderline pedo and he needs to realize it and realize that's how others are going to see him", "NTA\u2026 and also- How old was she when they got together?!

Maybe you should go on a double date so they can meet your new girlfriend.", "I am sorry you're in such a crappy situation, this girl sounds like a nightmare.

Tell him that you love him and will always be there to support him, but also let him know how your relationship with him will change if he does marry her.

I wish you luck and I hope to see an update about what you decide to do.", "You are not at all TA for hating this woman - she sounds like a nightmare - but it doesn't sound like there's anything you can do to dislodge her from your life at the moment. I'd focus hard on moving out, going to college and getting space from them. \n\nINFO: is part of the issue that it creates financial problems for your college plans if your dad kicks you out? Would he or other family agree to subsidise accommodation for you?", "NTA\n\nYour dad is a creep in a major way.  But it's ego boosting to him to be able to pick up a young, good looking girl.  Everyone looking at them thinks it's gross.  But he's not seeing it.\n\nBasically your dad is going to lose everything.  He'll lose his relationship with you and he'll lose his house and his self esteem.  She likes him because he has stuff... she may have daddy issues and prefers the older man.  Your dad also has assets and can provide for her which she will like.\n\nI hope she doesn't get pregnant to him!\n\nThe thing is that this is going to be fine for the next 10 years... maybe 15 but then older age will start to hit your dad.  He'll start having issues that come with being older.. needing glasses, sore joints, heart issues etc.  She'll end up his carer when she's in the prime of her life... or at the first time of old.. she'll skedaddle and your dad will feel like crap and all his friends will have deserted him.\n\nBut I would seriously be tempted to bring home a much older woman... I wonder what your dad would think of that.  A good outcome would be the two of them falling for each other.... know anyone that might be interested in your dad you can float this idea with?\n\nIronically I've found myself as an outsider in a similar situation.  My kid has found a guy who she thought was maybe 10 years older than her and they got on well... but it turns out it's 25 years and he hasn't told her his age.  She saw something with his DOB on it and was shocked.  She's a bit grossed out but not grossed out.  She's neurodivergent so goes from one extreme to the other.  She also has poor judgement thanks to the ND.  He's a nice guy from what I've heard and she's got nothing to offer (just young... no money, no assets, no job).  The guy is eating better, going to the gym and dyeing his hair to look younger.  But he doesn't know she knows how old he is... and is still hiding it.
