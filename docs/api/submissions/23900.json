My older sister (28F) has a son (my nephew) (1M). \n\nMy sister loves spontaneous nights out with random men, I will never judge how many people she sleeps with or goes out partying with- my only problem is when she brings strange men around my nephew. \n\nWhenever she use to want to go out she would offer to pay me to look after my nephew, I agreed and the first time went perfectly! She picked him up about an hour late but that wasn't an issue. \n\nThe 2nd time, she knew I was going to see my long distance boyfriend the next day and had a train early in the morning. She said she would be back at 10pm to pick him up, I had to be up at 6am and whilst I thought it was a little late I agreed. Long story short, she and the guy hooked up and she told me she would pick him up before my train, which she didn't and he kept me up all night crying. I had to ask our Dad to come pick him up- I also didn't get paid. \n\n3rd time, I'll keep it short. Surprised me with a visit, told me she was going shopping, didn't come back to pick him up and her phone kept going to voicemail. My stepmother sent me pictures of my sisters snapchat story of her in bed with a man. Didn't get paid.\n\n4th and LAST time. She had a breakdown, went to hospital and he was my responsibility for a month. Reasonable, but didn't even receive a thank you. \n\nAfter those last few times, I refused to look after him again unless she was present at all times. \n\nOne day she, my nephew and her brand new boyfriend were stuck in a hotel and she was crying on the phone to me, asking me to look after him because they were going to visit her dying stepdad and didn't want to bring my nephew. I told her no, and to hire a babysitter and I was done babysitting for free and if she dumped him on me one more time I'd call child protective services. \n\nIn the end, turns out she lied about the situation and was seen partying with her new boyfriend once she took my advise. I was called an asshole because what IF the situation was real, and also because I threatened child protection services.

He was your responsibility for A MONTH?? And NO PAYMENT?? NO THANK YOU??\n\nYour sister is an asshole and unfit parent. You should call CPS for the sake of that poor boy", "NTA. Honestly, though, I wish you could take this baby. You seem way more responsible and caring than her.", "NTA.  If the situation does happen again, do call CPS.", "NTA.  Firmly tell her you will not babysit again and that if she leaves the kid with you again you'll call the police.  She will not stop doing this until you play hardball.", "NTA for refusing to look after the nephew after so many things in the past\n\nHowever please keep an eye out for your nephew and potentially talk to other family members about what is happening.  Had a cousin who, when she couldn't (or didn't want to ask/have to admit what she was doing) get a babysitter use to give her baby a sedative so baby would sleep while she went out partying.\n\nA child shouldn't suffer just because their parent wants to have a social life.", "NTA.  For the life she wants to live, she should not have had a baby.  But that's not your problem.", "NTA\n\nNot your child, not your responsibility.  \n\nThe rest of this though\u2026jeesh, I feel bad for the little guy.  Your sister should not have had a baby.  That\u2019s not your responsibility though.", "Well, I'm pretty sure you don't need an answer to this one but NTA anyway.", "NTA and if this kid has other parental figures in his life that would be more stable, letting him avoid foster, I would call CPS. There's zero chance you are the only person she's doing this to and that means she is probably neglecting her child regularly to go party and have sex. You might only be seeing the tip of the iceberg. And hey, if the kid gets yoinked by CPS and you have to care for him, guess what? The state will make sure you get paid.", "NTA no one required is to watch another persons child, family or not, if they choose not to and the child protection services threat seams like a reasonable threat for someone who does not seam to care who her child ends up with for a night.", "NTA It\u2019s up to her to sort her life out. Let\u2019s assume she had been telling the truth for a moment. She could have taken her son with no problem at all. Don\u2019t get manipulated into effectively adopting a child you didn\u2019t choose to have", "NTA. You seem much more responsible than she is, stand your ground firm.", "NTA. Tell her you won't take her kid again, and if she drops him off anyway, call the police on her for child abandonment. Oh, and please do call CPS, don't just threaten.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n A reasonable boundary. She lied to you and abused your generosity far to often.", "NTA reminds me of when a friend's sister kept taking his car and his mom was like you have to let her because she's going to see y'alls dying aunt in the hospital. Like she felt extremely entitled to this car, to the point that one time he said no and she threatened to break the window, if he was gonna be like that. \n\nShe never once went to see their aunt, NOT ONCE. It really pissed me off after how she acted, and I asked her how she felt now that her aunt was dead, having never gone to see her like she said. \n\nIt was an asshole thing to say, full stop, but we were both saying uncharitable things at the time. I remember her reaction was so so shocked and hurt, she was like I cnt believe you'd say that to me?!?! After she just got done telling me I was fat and ugly and no one would ever love me. (I might be fat and ugly, but at least I don't have any kids or kid related drama and my boyfriend keeps insisting he loves me so)", "Not the AITA here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was only in my early teens when it happened but I still remember how absolutely angry my normally quiet, laidback mellow aunt was.  They only found out because someone asked them how they were going babysitting that night.  So they went around to their daughter's place and found their 10/11 month old grandchild asleep and not waking up.  Called ambulance/police etc.  Pre cell phone days so they couldn't call their daughter to find out her whereabouts."]}
