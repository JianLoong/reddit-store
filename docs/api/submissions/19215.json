She was a single mom with a little toddler, so we offered help. Since then she has moved in a boyfriend, his daughter and have had another baby together. They do not pay rent, but there are perks for living here. We are in the Ozarks directly on a free flowing river that has fish, kayaking, use of a new 4 wheeler 24/7 that stays parked at their home and 80 acres to roam and hunt on.\n\nThe only bills that they have are electric and internet - we cover the water/garbage/propane.\n\nWe commonly have get togethers where we do a shrimp boil. That usually ends with quite a few tipsy people and no one wants to wash the pots or coolers afterwards. (Only one big pot with a basket and two coolers). Let me add that my step daughter, boyfriend and the children all took part in the shrimp which was hosted by my husband and myself.\n\nWell, step daughter fell behind in paying us for her internet which is 130 a month. So we offered her boyfriend the option to wash those pots for one months worth of internet, so basically wash those three items for 130. Who wouldn't love that deal??\n\nWe waited for almost two weeks and nothing ever got done. The pot or the coolers hadn't even been moved.\n\nI inquired about what their intentions were and stated that actions speak louder than words. It appeared they did not appreciate what we do for them and that they are grown adults (both 30 yrs old). I told both of them that they are grown adults and need to be more responsible and take care of their business. Not everything is going to be handed to them.\n\nShe came crying to her father and he caved because she had all of these excuses. I told him that he shouldn't listen to those because they had us watch their infant while they went on a float trip this past Saturday. We did watch the little guy for them and let them have the day - then my husband sent them a reminder on Sunday morning to take care of the pots since we had paid for another month of their internet. We both thought that they would get to it on Sunday. My conversation where I told them to grow up basically occurred 46 hours after my husband's reminder - yet they still had not done it or acknowledged his text.\n\nSo they basically ate the food out of the pot, then were offered 130 to wash them and yet refused to. Just basically IGNORED us. Reminded me of my teenagers, but in this instance these folks are a few years away from a mid life crisis.\n\nHow should I feel? Upset? taken advantage of? Yep, Yep and Yep\n\nAm I the asshole for being upset and blunt that they need to grow up?", "created_utc": 1686152764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143gqt4/aita_for_telling_my_step_daughter_to_get_her_act/", "score": 1410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
