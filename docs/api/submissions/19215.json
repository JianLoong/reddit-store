She was a single mom with a little toddler, so we offered help. Since then she has moved in a boyfriend, his daughter and have had another baby together. They do not pay rent, but there are perks for living here. We are in the Ozarks directly on a free flowing river that has fish, kayaking, use of a new 4 wheeler 24/7 that stays parked at their home and 80 acres to roam and hunt on.\n\nThe only bills that they have are electric and internet - we cover the water/garbage/propane.\n\nWe commonly have get togethers where we do a shrimp boil. That usually ends with quite a few tipsy people and no one wants to wash the pots or coolers afterwards. (Only one big pot with a basket and two coolers). Let me add that my step daughter, boyfriend and the children all took part in the shrimp which was hosted by my husband and myself.\n\nWell, step daughter fell behind in paying us for her internet which is 130 a month. So we offered her boyfriend the option to wash those pots for one months worth of internet, so basically wash those three items for 130. Who wouldn't love that deal??\n\nWe waited for almost two weeks and nothing ever got done. The pot or the coolers hadn't even been moved.\n\nI inquired about what their intentions were and stated that actions speak louder than words. It appeared they did not appreciate what we do for them and that they are grown adults (both 30 yrs old). I told both of them that they are grown adults and need to be more responsible and take care of their business. Not everything is going to be handed to them.\n\nShe came crying to her father and he caved because she had all of these excuses. I told him that he shouldn't listen to those because they had us watch their infant while they went on a float trip this past Saturday. We did watch the little guy for them and let them have the day - then my husband sent them a reminder on Sunday morning to take care of the pots since we had paid for another month of their internet. We both thought that they would get to it on Sunday. My conversation where I told them to grow up basically occurred 46 hours after my husband's reminder - yet they still had not done it or acknowledged his text.\n\nSo they basically ate the food out of the pot, then were offered 130 to wash them and yet refused to. Just basically IGNORED us. Reminded me of my teenagers, but in this instance these folks are a few years away from a mid life crisis.\n\nHow should I feel? Upset? taken advantage of? Yep, Yep and Yep\n\nAm I the asshole for being upset and blunt that they need to grow up?", "created_utc": 1686152764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143gqt4/aita_for_telling_my_step_daughter_to_get_her_act/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may need to charge some rent, too. \n\nTell your husband that your relationship is suffering because of this situation and that he needs to step up and do something about it.", "NTA. You gotta stop letting them take advantage of you.", "NTA. You and your husband need to get on the same page or this will come between you. They have the ideal living situation and are absolutely taking advantage. I would hope that you and your husband would cut off their internet if they don\u2019t pay.", "NTA.. Let their internet go bye-bye. If it's shared with you, change the password. Charge them rent and make them pay for all of their utilities, garbage removal. Lock up the 4-Wheeler or take the key. They're taking full advantage of you and your husband and getting away with it.", "NTA.  This is a classic \u201chusband problem\u201d though.  You\u2019ll have these 2 on your property until you die if you don\u2019t do anything about the situation.  They should be working and paying rent.  But if your husband doesn\u2019t agree what can you do?  Marriage counseling or divorce, or reconcile yourself to providing for these people until you die.  \n\nSpeaking of death, If your husband dies first, as tends to happen, do you inherit?  Or the daughter?  Because you could be the one kicked out someday if the property is in his name, or even half his. If you need to save up money for your own property once he passes and you are out, plan for that.", "NTA, I would cut the cord figuratively and literally. They didn\u2019t pay for internet guess what? No internet. I know it\u2019s basically impossible to live without the internet these days, and if even one of them was in school I would maybe be more understanding, but if I don\u2019t pay my internet bill the company turns it off. You should do the same. Hell if they don\u2019t pay for another month or two change your plan and remove the router from their trailer.", "NTA, you are enabling these bums to live this way so it\u2019s sort of your fault though", "NTA. Shut of their internet access. Until they pay. They basically have no expense how do they not pay the little you ask of them?", "NTA but stop paying their bills at minimum. They are walking all over you and you're letting them. Well, your husband is; it sounds like you're finally starting to put your foot down. You and he need to get on the same page.\n\nFor now, change the wifi password and don't give it to them until they wash the dishes or pay you.", "NTA time to start charging rent and utilities \u2026.and no allowing them to not pay. Explain to your husband that you\u2019re doing them no favours not having  them learn adult responsibilities\u2026and maybe it\u2019s time to unplug the wifi", "NTA. They clearly feel entitled.\n\nHow long has she been living here and are they making plans for the future? Do they have a job?  Surely by now they must have put some money aside?  What about paying for food and what the kids needs?\n\nI think she knows how to get your husband on her side, probably using also his grandkids in a way of manipulating him. By enabling her, he is not doing her any favours, how is she supposed to learn to be an adult, and act her age if daddy is letting her get away with it? She needs to take responsibility and do a budget. If the internet and electric are in their names, tell them that no matter what you won't pay it, and you are expecting a full repayment since they didn't take you on your kind offer. You have the coolers they can use to store their food, they just have to be cleaned first. They have to learn consequences. Do not pay any more bills! In the real world they would have to deal with the bank, debts ... I would also told them that they need to get their act together and tell you exactly what their plans are (moving out ..) and what they are doing about it.", "NTA obviously. Except YWBTA if you keep allowing these mooches to live there rent-free, utility-free, chore-free, all while providing free childcare.\n\nYou and your husband are the reason they are such losers. You guys should sit down just the two of you, and come up with a monthly rent amount effective immediately. You should also cut off any utilities that you pay for/are shared. They need to get their own accounts.", "NTA. They have a sweet deal and are taking advantage of you. Time for them to grow.", "Change the password to Wi-Fi and Streaming whatever. Take the key ti the 4-wheeler orbits yours. \n\nTime for a come to Jesus with your spouse.\nBig time. \n\nQuit offering them deals.

She is retired and still paying her one daughter\u2019s rent and phone and other misc bills.", "NTA but good luck if you can't get your husband's support in helping these leeches grow up.", "NTA - Turn the internet off until they do what they agreed to do.  They are adults acting like children.  Start treating them like adults.  If you don't do X you don't get Y.  Full Stop.", "NTA. They are old enough that they need to learn that they have responsibilities in life. Your offer is more than fair, and they need to face the consequences if they can't either pay the bills or do the washing.", "NTA - y\u2019all are giving a lot to them already", "NTA. They do need to grow up, but why would they do this as long as you are enabling their current mooching lifestyle?", "NTA stop enabling them. They don\u2019t pay they don\u2019t have internet. Period.", "NTA. Geez, I'd take that deal. It's a reasonable exchange if you feel it's fair to both parties. They've taken advantage of your fair offer. I wonder if maybe you should let their internet lapse and keep your wifi password locked down tighter than Fort Knox. Consequences are necessary to make a point.", "NTA\n\nYou offered them a great deal and they spat it back in your face. It amazes me the obliviousness of some people on this planet. If they are complaining about not being treated like adults say \"Okay then, if your adults you'll start paying rent and bills then?\". \n\nIf that's what they want give it to them. Malicious compliance at its finest.", "NTA, they need to grow up, but your husband needs to be the one to put his foot down. Any conversation you have with your step daughter is pointless if your husband continues to allow it.", "NTA...There is absolutely nothing encouraging these people to move on with their own adult lives. You weren't rude or unfair.  I'd gladly wash your pots in lieu of my internet bill.", "NTA  they obviously don\u2019t seem to have any respect towards you and understand what you\u2019ve been doing for them. I\u2019d just let the internet go out to teach them a lesson. You gave them multiple chances to redeem themselves.", "NTA! It's time to AirBnb out your mobile home and let them learn what it's like to live in the real world.", "NTA you and your husband are letting them live like this. She moves in because she has no money but she decides to have a second kid??\n\nThey honestly need a timetable to leave and live on their own.", "NTA. I will happily wash a few pots for $130. That\u2019s a lot more than I make an hour doing harder work. Let me know next time you need a hand.", "NTA. I will happily wash a few pots for $130. That\u2019s a lot more than I make an hour doing harder work. Let me know next time you need a hand.", "Why should they get their act together? They have you and Dad that are going to cover them, regardless of the disrespect. Nothing is going to change.", "NTA. Real question is- do you really want to live like that? Do you think your relationship will work if your husband just lets his daughter be an ungrateful freeloader? This is a bad deal tbh.", "Classic example of the perils of doing too much. Their attitude isn\u2019t \u201coh wow I\u2019m so grateful they help us when they don\u2019t have to\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cwell if they want to do it, let \u2018em!\u201d  You\u2019ve taught them to be dependent on you. And that\u2019s bad for everyone, including their kids who are learning how life works.  You aren\u2019t really helping here. You are stunting their ability to be functioning adults. NTA for your expectation about cleaning, but this situation is one of your own making.", "NTA - let the internet get shut off for them. I bet they\u2019ll find the money.", "NTA - \n\nYou did what family always does and helps one another.  Then enters the bf ..... I have to ask this, do either of them have a job or source of income?  To me this is the classic, buy car vs car being gifted to you.  The one you buy you take care of, the one gifted you trash out.  You have EVERYTHING for them laid out, from living quarters to entertainment.  \n\nThis may be too late but it may be \"contract\" time.", "NTA. You need to have a very open conversation with your husband. He's enabling his daughter to be a parasite. She's contributes nothing but takes with both hands. If you're not already, I fully expect that they'll be expecting you to contribute towards their kids as well. \n\nThe daughter won't do anything because she's getting everything she wants anyway. She'll always have a sob story. You may need to be blunt and tell him that once he's gone She'll blow through any inheritance and then she'll be on the street, and he'll have contributed to that.", "Time to kick them out.", "NTA  - and show this thread to your husband.", "NTA.  Can I come live with you?  There is ZERO reason for either your SD or her BF to step up.  You have handed them a sweetheart deal and they will just continue to take, take, take.", "NTA If it was me I would have given them an ultimatum, help out or get out!", "YTA. You've raised a mooch, you gave her the opportunity to mooch, the mooching rampes up and now all of the sudden you feel taken advantage of?\n\nLOL No wonder YOUR 4 wheeler stays parked at THEIR place. \n\nYou set this situation up, and while you definitely should do something about it, be prepared for your mooch daughter to threaten to withhold the grandkids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
