It was other people who treated you bad. Sounds like they tried to defend you.\n\nSo why did you go No contact with people that tried to raise you to the best of their abilities?\nWhere you ashamed of them?", "YTA\n\nYou had a family that took you in, adopted you, loved you, never abused you, physically or emotionally. Provided education, love, food, clothing, and everything else you needed. They accepted you and defended you against their own family members. How did you thank them by blocking them on everything. You said that you moved across the state. How hard would it have been to send a message to your mom letting her know what is going on? Did they treat you that badly? I myself was adopted, so I understand what it's like. But my life wasn't peaches and cream. I still didn't cut off everyone. From what you said, they were wonderful parents. You owe them a phone call.", "Am I the asshole for abandonning my loving family ? \nOf course YTA", "YTA, not for how you felt but for how you dealt with it. Based on what you've written it doesn't sound like your parents and siblings ever mistreated you and seemed to treat you equally, to just leave with no explanation or warning is a shitty thing to do.", "Its complicated.\n\nI would say YTA, not because you felt like you weren't loved but because i feel as if you should have kept in touch with your family.\n\nBased on what you write, your family stood up for you when your grandparents mistreated you.\n\nI think you should just contact them and let them decide what type of relarionship you can have, if any at all.", "YTA - while you experienced bad behaviour on the part of the wider community, your direct adopted family seemed like they never did wrong by you and tried to have a positive relationship. \n\nYou cutting contact and literally erasing them out of your life sounds ungrateful to say the least. \n\nIdk but also have you considered how they were viewed having a white adopted baby? If the community was that bad I\u2019m sure they had a fair share of comments thrown their way too from the same type of people who bullied you (eg. The grandparents)", "Gentle YTA, you have children can you imagine how you would feel if they did something like you? They loved you and brought you up. They didn't see color just a little child who needed help.", "This sounds like a tough situation, I think I would need more info. Why did you run away from home? Were you just so unhappy with how you were treated by people outside of the house that you just needed to escape, or did you not fee safe at home either? Was there a reason you cut off your adoptive parents from contact? Were you worried they would come after you or something? \n\nI feel like there is something missing from the story. Also I highly recommend starting with a therapist to work through some obvious childhood trauma going on. I'm leaning towards NTA, mostly because It's tough to blame a teenager for wanting to completely leave behind a traumatic portion of their life. Staying out of contact leaves that barried so you don't have to deal with it. It sounds like your adoptive parents were supportive, but everywhere else was hell for you. It's unfortunate that you felt the need to cut them out (if they actually were great), but I think it's a valid trauma response.", "YTA, they took you in and did everything they could to connect with you and have a good relationship, while you dismissed them.\n\nThen to just leave them, with no discussion or warning.", "YTA. Your parents and siblings seemed to have loved and supported you. Sounds like you had a rough childhood, but that wasn\u2019t their fault. Yeah, you probably should feel bad.", "Gently - YTA. Imagine grieving your lost son & brother for 10 years without ever knowing what happened & why. Heartbreaking.\n\nYou got a tough hand dealt you, no doubt. Pain makes people do hurtful things\u2026 but fighting negative with more negative never helps.", "YTA. It doesn't sound like they did anything to you to warrant your cutting them out like this. They tried to have a relationship with you. Sounds like they loved you. Yet due to the actions of others, you decided to punish them.\n\nI also grew up as a white child in a predominantly black area (in fact, in a predominantly black country). People bully no matter what. I was one of like three white people in a class of 30. So I understand sticking out like a sore thumb but this isn't your parents fault.", "NTA, adoption agencies have a lot of guidance in this situation and his family seriously went against it. If the parents are adopting a child of a different race to themselves they often expect them to move into a neighborhood with primarily others of the child's race.  It's incredibly tramatic to raise a child as always being an \"other\" and often seen as less than. Imagine not being loved or liked by your own grandparents and still having to be around them. It's like being the black sheep of the family but x100. I wish you to heal and hopefully have a relationship to your immediate family one day, but I'm not going to fault you for your trama response.", "I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re bad, but YTA in this situation. I understand why you wanted to run away but cutting off all the connections is too extreme since your family really cared (I\u2019m sure they stiil do) about you.", "NTA. These people responding do not understand adoption. I am a white adoptive parent to two Black and white kids. We are taught how important it is to find friends of color for us and for our kids. We\u2019re taught that love is not enough, and we need to protect our kids as much as possible from racism. Your parents didn\u2019t do those things. You have every reason to feel your feelings. And you are under no obligation to be grateful. \n\nI would recommend therapy for you, if you\u2019re not already in it. And you might want to see if your parents or other adoptive family members might also seek counseling, if you feel the relationships are worth repairing.\n\nSeriously, NTA.", "YTA.  Your bio family must have selected this family for a cross-race adoption to a family with 4 kids to have happened; regardless,  some care obviously went into your placement.  You say your (adoptive) parents were loving and protective.  Yet you not only ran away from an environment in which you felt out of place, you ran from the people who loved you.  You jace children\u2014how would you fell if they did the same thing to you ?", "YTA. There was no reason to leave with no contact about why", "NTA.   \nYou have to live your life.   \nStay NC, and stay happy.", "I think this is more ESH. A lot of commenters don\u2019t understand the trauma that can come from adoption. I hope you can find a counselor who understands trauma because I think it might help.", "YTA", "YTA. You owe your parents an apology. Can you imagine the pain they must feel?! You\u2019ve cut them off for no fault of their own. You\u2019ve also stolen any relationship your kids may of had with their grandparents. Fix this before it\u2019s too late.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From your post I\u2019m really not sure what your family did to deserve the way you treated them. Sounds silly to say but it almost feels racist on your part. Based on your post, you sound like an ungrateful prick.", "YTA. What do you mean you never thought they would be that impacted? You were their child! They did everything they could and they loved you. \n\nPlease get into some serious therapy.", "did you ever talk to them about how it felt to be the boy you were in that environment? you were struggling with it, but did you ever ask them for help?\n\nit sounds like you might be punishing them, not for something they did, but for something they didn't do, and didn't even know that it needed doing because they didn't realise what was happening. \n\nit sounds like they tried to give you love, but didn't realise they weren't reaching you in some ways. but it sounds like they deserve to understand why you disappeared.  that may be hard to do, but it may be good for you and for them.", "YTA \n\nSucks to be the minority, huh?", "The rest of the world sees color.

I wanted to be \"normal\" so i fled to a place where i was just another \"normal\" person.", "Agree, NTA. You were made to feel like the odd one out, your adopted grandparents were racist and many family members seemed to follow their lead or treat you like some sort of exotic animal. That\u2019s unacceptable regardless of skin colour. Your adopted parents may have done their best but part of that included not allowing racist treatment of you from family members. In that they failed. You didn\u2019t bond and left as soon as legally possible. When someone from the family finally meets with you they choose to scream and yell themselves into getting frogmarched out by security rather than talk to you and ask why. Likely because they know they were racist and unwelcoming and it\u2019s their freaking fault.", "The blas\u00e9 attitude people have about prejudice toward white people infuriates me. They don't consider it racism because it's not systemic, and so they don't find it to be an issue or reprehensible. And yet we see exactly how damaging it is in people like OP who find themselves in the minority situation with no one seriously protecting them from such disgusting behavior.", ">Sounds racist on your part. \n\nHow am i the racist one? \n\nI was the one who was bullied because of my skin colour. \n\nI had kids in my school touching my hair without my consent.\n\n I was called racist for just being white.\n\nWhen i went to church, old people would give me bad looks.\n\nOne time, my sister( the one i mentioned on this post) made- me braids and i was punched by a kid from my class because i was \"trying to be black\".\n\nI understand being the AH for running away without saying anything but i will not tolerate being called a racist.", "So, you are saying it was wrong how i was treated?", "Bless you and yes you are right, I can't imagine what OP, the parents and siblings went through, they just want their child/brother back. You are amazing and wish you well.", "And why couldn\u2019t you just move and stay in contact with your family?\n\nYTA", "That makes sense, but still doesn't explain why you cut out people that sound like caring parents. Why were you avoiding them?", "OP had experiences that many transracial adoptees of my generation (Gen X) experienced. Being \u201cthe only\u201d, treated as other, etc. the hair touching is a big problem. It doesn\u2019t matter what color the kids involved are. That kind of environment is toxic. And this is on top of the trauma adoptees often experience due to simply being adopted, and losing their first families, in the first place.", "No he's saying that you're getting an idea of what the rest of the minorities experience every day of their lives.", "And how monities are treated is wrong, right?", "You're missing the point. Sounds like you're angry for not experiencing white privilege.", ">Sounds like you're angry for not experiencing white privilege.\n\nNo, i an angry for:\n\n-My grandparents hating me;\n\n-Being bullied in school;\n\n-Have the whole class looking at me when we talked about the civil rights movement;\n\n-Kids touching my hair;\n\n-Being treated like a pet:\n\nAll because of my race.", "All things you wouldn't get with white privilege. And none of it excuses what you did to the family that loved you and took you in. Aww your grandparents were mean to you? That sucks but not your parents or siblings fault. Bullied at school? I got bullied at school and I didn't abandon my parents. Whole class looking at you? What a nonsense thing to be upset by and not a reason to abandon your family. Kids touching your hair - kids are interested in things they don't normally see and not a reason to abandon your family. Being treated like a pet? Pull the other one. Stop wallowing in self pity, you treated your family like dirt."]}
