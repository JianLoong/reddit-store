I don\u2019t remember the actual event very well, but I remember coming to afterwards. From what my dad said, the car hit the side I was sitting on (we were t-boned by a drunk driver) and I slammed my head into the window. I have a limp now due to a fractured hip, but the main issue is my right ear. I\u2019m fully deaf in that ear, thankfully just that one. I\u2019m not sure exactly what caused the deafness, my dad never told me and doesn\u2019t like thanking about the crash.\n\nWith that out of the way, we cut to the present. This happened yesterday. I was at work when a customer approached me by my right side. My specific job isn\u2019t important, but I work at a grocery store so retail. I didn\u2019t see or notice her. She went \u2018ahem\u2019 quietly. Usually I can hear pretty well with my left ear, but I didn\u2019t hear her. I was daydreaming as I stocked the shelves, so I was a little distracted. I will say maybe that was my fault, but I couldn\u2019t hear her. So, what did she do? Instead of saying something louder, she grabbed my shoulder and tugged me toward her. She yelled at me, and said \u2018you don\u2019t ignore a customer!\u2019 \n\nThis shocked me. I am horrible with confrontation. I yanked my arm away and looked at her with this look of shock and fear, I was startled. I had said \u2018I apologize ma\u2019am, I didn\u2019t hear you. Is there anything I can do for you?\u2019\n\nShe did that huff eye roll combo, the one that makes you feel like crap. \u2018I don\u2019t like your attitude. I know you could hear me!\u2019\n\nI remember having a realization that this would not go well. I remember saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, I am deaf on my right side. I honestly could not hear you. Can I help you with anything?\u2019 I was trying my best just to change the subject, but she kept insisting I could have heard her, then she said \u2018young people like you can\u2019t be deaf!\u2019\n\nI swear, that sentence alone screamed ignorance. My blood boiled, and I snapped. It was the end of my shift, I was tired, and I do feel guilty for this. I had said \u2018then you\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t the one in a car crash while you were a child, but I wasn\u2019t so lucky was I?\u2019\n\nAt this point a manager came over to help her and told me to go into the back. When he returned, he told me I wasn\u2019t in trouble and that she\u2019s in here all the time and usually is rude. However, he had me leave a few hours early. I should explain this is the first time I\u2019ve ever snapped at a customer before.\n\nI feel guilty, AITA?", "created_utc": 1673915218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dxj7i/aita_for_snapping_at_a_customer_who_didnt_believe/", "score": 744, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t have to explain your disability.", "NTA\n\nRudeness is one thing (it\u2019s not ok but sadly common in retail), but to put hands on you is assault. You\u2019d have been within your rights to ask security to remove her from the building at least. Tell your manager she grabbed/pulled you, hopefully there is video footage of this aisle. There should be consequences for her behaviour (such as being banned from the store or a caution from police), as clearly her sense of entitlement has grown from being rude to putting hands on others.", "NTA-you handled it as best as you could under the circumstances. Your irate customer was clearly the asshole.", "Absolutely NTA", "NTA. Some people need to be put in their place. Try not to let it affect you", "NTA\n\nworking in retail is hard, the public sucks.  This customer was being a total a**.\n\nSadly, that seems to be more frequent than the exception.\n\nThere\u2019s really not a lot you could have differently, imho.\n\nThat customer is lucky she didn\u2019t encounter me like that - as soon as she touched me, she would have been on the floor - but that\u2019s also why I\u2019m not in Customer Service.", "NTA, not at all. Agree with others that she should be banned from the store.", "NTA, employees should be able to put a rude customer in their place.", "NTA. that lady is an AH though. Don't believe that someone might have a disability because they're young?! They must be living some privileged life. \n\nYou have no reason to feel guilty.", "Nta. What a stupid person. I don\u2019t think its really all that uncommon to have hearing issues after an automobile accident.  But if it were, there are plenty of people who are born deaf. And she escalated even further by grabbing you. You were more pleasant than I would be. I flail like an octopus if someone startles me.", "NTA\n\nShe was the one who was rude by ignoring you and not believing your. Your manager probably sent you home early to give you a chance to recover from the rude customer.  Sorry, it\u2019s sad that some people can\u2019t accept that young people also have disabilities.", "NTA whatsoever.  Sometimes people deserve to get snapped on, and this lady was clearly one of them", "NTA You were physically assaulted. You defended yourself. You do notvlose your rights just because you work in retail.", "NTA \n\nHowever I do feel like you should find out what caused the deafness in one ear as it seems like an important part of your medical history to be missing.", "Even your manager said NTA, enough said.  Being a nice person doesn't mean letting people bully you, and honestly everything you said was incredibly reasonable considering how she was behaving", "NTA simply because anyone who would act like THAT is a wretch and deserves whatever she gets. I think he had you go home so that you could decompress. I\u2019m sorry that you had to deal with such heinous ignorance!", "NTA", "NTA how is she have anything to do with hearing lol .", "NTA. You handled it professionally and with way more patience than I would have. The customer pushed you over the edge with their rude ignorance. I hope this was a wakeup call for them that you don\u2019t what someone has experienced, and a blatant statement claiming young people can\u2019t be deaf gives you full permission to wash yourself of any guilt you may feel. They\u2019re an idiot. Pay them zero mind. \n\nYou were patient and as kind as you could be after being physically manhandled and accosted while in shock. Your manager should be supporting you better.", "NTA.   You're  nicer than I would have been.", "NTA\n\nNo, you did nothing wring. Always gonna be ashhole customers. You can only do exactly what you did.\n\nTaking a bit of time away from the situation was a wonderful gift from your boss. BUT, did you get.paid for your whole shift? LOL I'm petty & think you deserve the pay!", "NTA. You are way more polite than you needed to be, and if she has consistently been rude to staff she should be banned from the store. Even if this had been her first offense, the fact that she grabbed you and yelled at you should have gotten her banned. I'm really sorry that this happened to you, and sorry that your manager isn't looking out for you and your co-workers.", "Nah NTA. The customer should have apologized and asked politely for assistance.", "NTA. Also, she assaulted you by placing her hand on you without your permission. Inform your manager and get the patron banned. Stores and restaurants are allowed to ban customers if they have a history of terrible manners to employees. It's their right.", "NTA", "She should have never touched you, period. NTA and she should be banned.", "NTA. The manager probably sent you home because they knew you were subjected to enough ignorant BS for one day.", "NTA.  My daughter is deaf in one ear due to a tumor that was growing in her middle ear. Unfortunately, her hearing in her other ear isn't very good either.  People are very judgmental.  She shouldn't have put her hand on you in such an aggressive way.", "Nta sounds like the manager knows this trouble shopper and gave you the rest of the shift off to calm down as they say.", "NTA. Im so sorry this happened to you. \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta regardless she put hands on you no one is entitled to touch you like that you handled it a lot better than most and I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty about that", "I work customer service/fast food. NTA. I'd see if your manager would be willing to speak to her or ban her from the store. If she's causing a consistent pattern, she needs to be told to get the fuck out and stay away. My manager would absolutely do that for us, and it sounds like your manager might be the same type. He got you out of the situation, let you know you're not in trouble and reassured you it wasn't your fault. \n\nCustomers fucking *suck* sometimes.", "NTA -\n\nWhen will people realize that not all handicaps are visual? Sorry you experienced this and feel badly about it - but she was rude, not you.  She kept pushing you until you broke. \n\nHang in there and don't let this upset or bother you anymore.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
