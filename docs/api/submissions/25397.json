My beautiful girlfriend \"Francesca\" [31F] is a senior engineer on the the project.\n\nWe just discovered Francesca is pregnant and we're both delighted. We haven't made a decision about which of us will take a year out for parental leave, but she'll definitely take the last couple of months before the birth out. She said before that she intends to work as much as she can. \n\nI'm a bit worried about this. Francesca mainly does her thing in the office, but she occasionally goes onto the site to observe the work being done. Like most construction sites, it's full of hazardous dust, chemicals which produce toxic fumes, slip and trip hazards and other dangers. Obviously the workers and Francesca will wear PPE and respiratory protective equipment, but I feel like even then, there's more of a risk to an expectant mother and her unborn child. \n\nBut she doesn't want to be stuck in the office, as she's very passionate about seeing her work being \"brought to life\". I don't see why this is so important. She isn't doing the physical work or managing it, and the site teams produce detailed reports at the end of every shift. Surely that's safer than risking herself and the baby out there? \n\nI was working late yesterday so she got home before me. The topic came up again and turned into an argument. She accused me of \"trying to control her career\" and called me a \"typical construction worker\" who is \"obsessed with being a manly man\". I said that wasn't fair and that I just wanted her and our baby to be safe. She went upstairs in tears and slept in our spare room. \n\nI don't want to control her or her career, I just don't want her or our baby to get hurt. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692879825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1600gui/aita_for_not_wanting_my_pregnant_girlfriend_to_go/", "score": 496, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are a construction site manager, not a doctor, and not the woman in question. Your feelings here as an expectant father may be understandable but completely and utterly irrelevant. Sorry, YTA here.", "YTA. I understand you have a natural instinct to be protective towards your GF and your baby, but you have to trust your GF's judgement.\n\nIf she's as experienced around a construction site as you suggest, she understands the risks but she also most likely knows how to stay safe on one too.", "YTA, you seem to be saying your aren\u2019t sufficiently good at making your site safe for your girlfriend to work there. I wouldn\u2019t want to be one of the crew there everyday. It\u2019s your job to make the site safe, so do it. Also sounds like your controlling and a bit jealous, so pack that in too.", "YTA. It's not your body. There are legal standards for this, where scientists and doctors have figured out what's safe, and as long as the place is operating within those, she's fine. You don't get to control her body because she's carrying a future child. I know you mean well but it's just not ok to expect her to change her career because of your paranoia. And her not going onsite could have a big impact on her career... she's now seen as the pregnant woman who can't do everything the men can, and sexism is rampant in that industry, as you should know, so you can connect the dots. Just stay out of her decisions and support what she wants to do with this. She's carrying a pregnancy for 9 months and honestly your opinions, especially about her body, are going to have to go on the back burner.", "YTA.

It's hypocritical and misogynistic now.   This is between her and her doctors.  Stop trying to control her.", "YTA. In your mind, you may think that you mean well but you are controlling how and where she works. Also saying things like \"I don't see why this is so important\" when she wants to see the work come to life is dismissive.", "If the construction site was that dangerous to pregnant women it would be noted as such by your health and safety people. Clearly it isn\u2019t. My friend works in a chemical plant and as soon as she found out she was pregnant and disclosed it she was moved to work offsite because of the health and safety regulations. The fact that this is just your feeling and not based on anything else is patronizing and unfair. You don\u2019t get to control her just because you have unfounded worries.  That\u2019s a you problem not a her problem.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is an engineer, not an incubator. You have not valid reason to think your girlfriend is any more at risk now than she was before.

She's wearing PPE and likely in regular consultation with her medical team who likely knows what her job is and what it may typically entail.

It's good to voice your concerns and talk about which precautions she can take.", "YTA. \n\nYour girlfriend should discuss this with her doctor. If her doctor says she is good to go, then she is. If the doctor says she should take certain precautions, she should - but this doesn't really have anything to do with you. That you \"feel\" it is not safe is irrelevant. You are not a doctor. This is about her body and her health, you must trust her judgement. \n\nYou are disrespectful when you say you \"don't see why this is so important\". You should be supporting your girlfriend who is passionate about her job.

She\u2019s a human being, not an incubator.", "YTA, you are an idiot in interfering in the way your girlfriend works. Pregnant women do not need to be wrapped up in cotton wool and are perfectly capable of making decisions about risks.", "YTA. She\u2019s pregnant not disabled.

Her whole body is about to change - organs shifting around to fit the baby, bladder control out the window, feet and ankles swelling to CARRY YOUR CHILD into the world. While she seems happy to have the kid she still would like some normalcy in her life. Especially since your whole world flips upside down after a kid.", "YTA. Unless there is a medical reason not allowing her to be on-site, it is no one's choice but hers to be there. \nYou do not need to understand why it is so important for her to be there, it just is important to her and you need to respect that. \nShe knows her limits better than you do. You can not keep pushing her to follow your advice. best you can do is support her. Let her know you want her to be comfortable and ask if there is something she wants you to do.", "YTA but your heart is in the right place even if your head is in the 50\u2019s.  Apologize.", "YTA. Architect here. \n\nYou\u2019re wife is an engineer and she is actively working and evaluating if buildings are being built to her specifications. \n\nHer being pregnant, especially this early on, is of no concern to you. Typically for onsite days the construction team makes sure things are ready for walk through, so if there are any hazardous chemicals they have you put on PPE and they make sure whoever is checking has been trained on safety procedure and isn\u2019t climbing around unsafe and unsecured locations. \n\nYou can voice your concern once, but what you are asking of her is to stunt her career. Now when she gets further along she will likely be asked to stop. But there is no legitimate reason why she can\u2019t do a field inspection earlier in her pregnancy.", "YTA for the way you handled it. You had totally normal concerns for the safety of your baby, but I think in this case you hyper focused on the extremities of the construction site to force your point and control her behaviour.", "YTA.  If it's ok with Francesca's doc it's ok and it sounds like she's taking all of the necessary precautions.  Apologize and leave it alone.", "YTA. \n\nUnless she climbing a ladder to straddle a beam 10 stories up to bolt things down, there aren't more active dangers on a construction site than there are in every day life. \n\nIf the construction company is licensed and follows the rules, and so does she, there are only very mild dangers, and those same dangers exist everywhere. Yes, they are more hazards on a site, but there is also a safety plan and procedures along with protective gear. \n\nYour girlfriend doesn't cease to become a fully independent human being when she gets pregnant. She isn't only an incubator now, she gets to make decisions and live a daily life, sure, there will be limitations but right now, a construction site isn't one of those limitations. \n\nThe real AH thing here though is your statement about her liking to see her work: \" I don't see why this is so important.\" So you don't understand or value your girlfriend's passions, feelings, or successes? It is important because SHE says it is important. Being pregnant doesn't mean you get to dismiss all the other facets of who she is.", "Of course YTA, she\u2019s having a baby not fighting cancer.

She is competent to be safe bro.  She is a senior engineer. Support her in what SHE wants to do, or get ready to be dumped for being so controlling.  \n\nWhat do you think women that are working do when they get pregnant?? Just quit there jobs or start refusing to do portions of their job?  You are being delusional.  \n\nThe baby will be fine.", "YTA asshole for not sufficiently listening to and supporting her.", "YTA \nAs long as her OB says she can continue living her life as is (with any necessary modifications) she can do whatever she wants.  You have your concerns and that is fine BUT they are overboard and you are reacting out of fear - That is NOT OK.  Ask to go to her next OB appointment and let her know you would like to speak to the OB about your fears.  This way the Dr reassures you and you can back off and relax.", "YTA. She's an adult just like you.", "YTA\n\nAs an engineer too, what the hell are you building that the site is full of hazards and chemicals? Especially in infrastructure, that just seems like a HUGE exaggeration.\n\nI'd definitely understand being concerned if she was working at heights, as she'd be more prone to feeling dizzy and such, but trying to forbid her from going to the site is very controlling.", "If there is physical toxicity at your work, that's true for everyone, including you. Nobody should be breathing in it, let alone a pregnant woman. It doesn't suddenly become healthy for her once she's no longer pregnant, or for you.  Kind of missing the point here.  ETA: YTA, she's not your property and your concern is misplaced.", "Info: Have you guys consulted your doctor? There are 2 sides to this. How you feel and how it actually is.\n\nIve worked construction before and it is a place that's safe when rules are followed. But rules are rarely followed lol. So you might have a point.\n\nWhat does her doc say?", "YTA - not only are you being controlling, but you\u2019re creating an environment where she *might* feel pressured to put herself and her/your baby at risk due to battling egos. *Even if* you don\u2019t feel this way, *she might*. It would be better to emphasize that you trust her to make good decisions for herself and her/your baby.

Your \"worry\" isn't coming off like it's anything but controlling.\n\nWith proper PPE it is completely safe for her to continue her on site work.", "You mean well, but...\n\nYes, you are controlling and you need to calm down.\n\nIf you begin to see lions behind every tree now, just because she is pregnant, you are going to drive her nuts.\n\nIf you never had a problem before you shouldn't have one now.\nShe can manage perfectly well", "In the UK, once a woman notifies her employer that she is pregnant they need to carry out a risk assessment to identify hazards, accommodations etc. This is a legal requirement even for a desk job in an office block, let alone for being on a construction site.\n\nIf the risk assessment clears her to carry on, then she is free to carry on. If the risk assessment says she mustn't enter certain areas, her employer has a duty of care to ensure that she doesn't (within reason, I'm not suggesting physical restraint!)\n\nI don't know where you are based but given that you're somewhere allowing a year's parental leave I expect you have a similar requirement.\n\nI don't know if you being site manager makes you her boss, but regardless I'd advise you to have any assessment carried out by an independent party to avoid any accusations of bias and to protect your work and personal relationships.\n\nI get why you are concerned but the way you are currently handling this, YTA.", "YTA. How do other women in the company/business handle the situation?\n\nUnless there are specific health and safety regulations for pregnant women in your industry, it's entirely her choice.

Continue arguing and you'll be a bigger asshole every time.", "I knew exactly where this was going before I even opened the post \nYTA\nYour girlfriend didn't just turn into an incubator the moment she got pregnant.

Addressing it once is fine, repeatedly is uncalled for.", "Soft YTA. \n\nIf you are really coming from a place of concern, that is sweet. But it turns into controlling behavior when you\u2019ve asked a question, it\u2019s been answered and you keep pressing. \n\nYour partner is wanting your support. She wants to be the woman who keeps working. Your job right now is to support her and help her find ways to accomplish her goal, not tell her to go sit at the desk ask day (which by the way, is NOT healthier for pregnant women. It is much better to be up and moving with your blood flowing than being sedentary unless advised otherwise by a doctor.) \n\nWhat can you do to support her? Make sure the work site is safe. Be on everyone\u2019s ass about safety so she is walking into the safest site possible. If you want to control things, control your site and make sure every safety rule is being followed to the T. You can also do things like make sure she has new clean filters for her respirator, make sure she has quality work boots to wear on site, make sure her other safety equipment is in top shape. \n\nContinuing to work as she normally would is very important to her. You don\u2019t have to understand it, but if you want to be a good partner you will do what you need to do to support her. She works in a male dominated industry where there is a lot of stigma against women, especially pregnant women and working moms.

I certainly understand the baby concern, especially since it sounds like your first kid.\n\nHowever, you also can't lock her in a tower until the kid arrives. How truly hazardous is the work site? Perhaps you could do an abbreviated tour and avoid the really bad areas? As the manager, perhaps you could take a few extra steps on that day to make sure it's a bit safer.", "NTA, these comments are crazy. You are very much allowed to be concerned for your *unborn child*. So many things could happen to a fetus in the early stages and it\u2019s better to simply play it safe. The air quality is not the only safety hazard here, there could be fires, falling debris, tripping hazards, electricity and more. You aren\u2019t even asking her to throw away her entire career by just asking her to steer clear of probably one of the more dangerous places for *anyone*, never mind someone pregnant with your own kid. This request also is not as absurd since she already doesn\u2019t spend much time there anyway.", "YTA.  No concern at all about physical work and standard dust.  However, if there are chemicals being used actively, she/her manager and or your occupational health staff need to look at the SDS and check the hazards and PPE requirements.  No one should be around chemicals without completing Right-To-Know and exposure training.  Most personal chemical hazards come from skin/eye/etc contact and then from inhalation.\n\nThere are some solvents that she should avoid since she is pregnant, but most \"chemical fumes\" are relatively harmless if you are outdoors and already wearing PPE.", "YTA. She is pregnant, not an invalid. She's also an adult and is therefore able to make her own decisions. She may later decide that she doesn't think it's a good idea to be on site, or she may not. Either way, it's her decision.", "I'm in the minority here, but NTA. I just had my first baby and we were extremely careful about exposures including chemical and noise exposure. It sounds like she can still do her overall job from the office. Maybe since she is fixated on it a compromise would be her looking at the sites when they aren't active (prior to the workers starting for the day)? \n\nYes, consult her doctor, but they gave pregnant women thalidomide till we found out that was a bad idea. Sometimes we don't know what is safe in pregnancy till it's too late. \n\nI know there are a lot of Y T A votes \"her body\" etc., but for those who plan to keep their pregnancies, my personal thought is you start looking out for your child during pregnancy. I want my child to be as healthy as possible. I don't want to look back if they have a syndrome or illness and wonder if it was a stupid choice I made that caused them to suffer.", "DNTA, you're natural instinct is to protect your fiance and unborn baby.\n\nI can only suggest you speak to her about it again.  if she really wants to go, you may just have to let her.  \n\nIf the PPE etc is in place as i am sure it will be, i doubt there will be any harm done.\n\nsuccessful relationships need both partners to compromise, this might be your turn.", "You're the asshole until an accident happens and hurts the unborn baby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Francesca mainly does her thing in the office, but she occasionally goes onto the site to observe the work being done. Like most construction sites, it's full of hazardous dust, chemicals which produce toxic fumes, slip and trip hazards and other dangers. Obviously the workers and Francesca will wear PPE and respiratory protective equipment, but I feel like even then, there's more of a risk to an expectant mother and her unborn child. \n\nBut she doesn't want to be stuck in the office, as she's very passionate about seeing her work being \"brought to life\". I don't see why this is so important. She isn't doing the physical work or managing it, and the site teams produce detailed reports at the end of every shift. Surely that's safer than risking herself and the baby out there? \n\nI was working late yesterday so she got home before me. The topic came up again and turned into an argument. She accused me of \"trying to control her career\" and called me a \"typical construction worker\" who is \"obsessed with being a manly man\".

You need to trust she is doing everything she can to protect this baby and herself as well. \n\nPlease talk to her about this. Tell her your concerns (not in a controlling way.

Speaking as a woman who is currently pregnant (2nd baby), there is a necessary process of adapting to the realities of pregnancy and the normal risk calculation does have to change. You have to reassess previously normal activities - like eating unpasteurised cheese. This does not mean assuming fragility or infantilising pregnant women - eg I\u2019m still lifting weights at the gym and working my demanding job normally. But for my first pregnancy, I had to consider whether I could travel for work as normal to parts of the world with low but real risks of malaria, dengue and zika, along with general issues around food and water safety. I decided, with discussions with my partner, that it was not worth the risk. \n\nIt is also normal to make decisions about my health and my unborn baby\u2019s health with my husband. Why would we not? We are his family and he is mine. In the same way, I have a say in his lifestyle choices (eg healthy living, exercise) because they affect him, me and our family.\n\nOP is not being an AH to have questions and concerns, especially since he knows first hand the risks of the site. Francesca is not an AH to want to carry on with her life normally for as long as possible (being transformed from an autonomous individual into a mother can be a dehumanising/alienating experience and she is probably feeling some knee jerk reactions of being trapped and controlled. She may also not be ready to tell her workplace, especially if (as it would) she is in the first trimester). Personally, I did not tell my workplace about either pregnancy until after the 20 week anomaly scan. \n\nTo me, OP and Francesca need to sit down and have a calm, evidence based conversation about the general risks of the site, whether, how and when Francesca\u2019s individual risk might increase because of pregnancy or later stages of pregnancy (eg, by about 5/6 months the size of the foetus can affect balance, and from about 7 months the belly usually blocks view of your own feet, making a slip/trip a bit more likely), and the extent to which the level of harm has increased because of pregnancy. From about 5/6 months the foetus is bigger and less protected by the pelvis and abdominal wall, and a hard slip/fall could potentially be more serious for mother and baby (unless very bad, I doubt a slip or fall would affect her or the baby in the first trimester, baby is tiny and well protected.)  Whilst pregnant, our immune systems also tend to be weaker, and she may find herself suffering more discomfort from accidental dust / particle inhalation than she usually would. However it sounds like that risk can be addressed through proper use of PPE.\n\nSo, NAH yet, but OP should make sure that he is not being knee jerk in his position, that he is taking an evidence and risk-based approach, and should keep in mind that Francesca is going through a massive mental and physical adjustment right now and support her in keeping on feeling like herself, not just \u201cmum\u201d.", "I was leading Field Botany field trips when I was 8 months pregnant. \n\nMy research involved a scanning electron microscope (an X-ray emitter).

But you simply can't say that what's good for one person is good for everyone.", "Because it's AITA and look at this subreddit's user base. You can't have opinion on your own child is you are male lmao\n\nI think its NAH, he is going to become first time parents, obviously he is going to worry a lot more than normal, swear to god people on this subreddit will find anything to be angry about.\n\nAlso it's normal that some things become dangerous while you are pregnant that were not as big of an issue as when you are not pregnant.\n\nAs long as OP is going to listen to the doctor and not be too overbearing he is not TA.", "Because the unborn child is still in the body of the woman. Which he cannot control. \n\nThe issue is control. Not his concern for the baby", "Yep exactly. I get the idea she out-earns him and he\u2019s either consciously or subconsciously attempting to stifle her career so he can become the big earner\u2026but I could be wrong there.\n\nHaven\u2019t met a site super yet who earns more than a senior engineer.\n\nEdit: Also, if he claims the site is so hazardous, he\u2019s completely abandoned his duty towards the people/trades working on site. There are regulations he\u2019s supposed to be following for everyone\u2019s health and safety.", "Expressing his fears is one thing. Insisting that she stop doing normal work activities that she feels well able to do is another. This isn\u2019t OP asking once and then done. This is OP pushing to the point his partner is wondering where her person went.", "You're comparing drinking and smoking, things that are well documented to permanently damage or kill the fetus, to a woman continuing her regular, safe career. He's not right in this case.", "The baby I get but if the anxiety is for her why is he only just raising concerns?", "Thank you for saying that. A lot or people start with a witch hunt and just go with the crowd. These people here are ridiculous.", "Yeah but why wasn't he anxious about her safety before?", "Ding ding ding.", "How dare evil man be concerned about his wife and baby \ud83d\ude21", "On the other hand, they are two in this. In both my pregnacies, my husband has seen hazards I hadn\u2019t thought of and reminded me of them. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m incapable or stupid or that he\u2019s patronizing. OP works on these sites, whereas the GF visits them occasionally. It is therefore relevant for him to have an opinion and they discuss it.", "I have cats. I had no idea I wasn't supposed to clean their litterboxes while pregnant. My doctor only told me after I offhandedly mentioned I needed to clean them to my husband in front of her.  I am an educated woman who works in a highly competitive corporate position. I find it ridiculous that you believe a pregnant woman knows absolutely everything about pregnancy and what's dangerous and what's not. I find it cruel that you are essentially telling him to buck up and shut up about his anxiety. People with your attitude are why men don't share anything about their emotions. Yes, she should talk to her doctor about it, but don't just assume she already did.", "You realize that women do not magically know everything there is to know about pregnancy and babies, right? \n\nThe correct thing to do is to ask the doctor with her, bring up his concerns, discuss the risk together and come to a conclusion that everyone is comfortable with.\n\nOne partner does not get to make all the decisions on this. There is a child growing inside of her, it is not exclusively hers. They are both going to be dealing with the consequences of their choices for the rest of their lives.", "They're a team.  They work on family things together.", "The workers at the site have the MSDS sheets for all chemicals on site, or they better if OSHA shows up.  The workers on site will have more access to warning labels specific to their jobs than the doctor will.  Bringing the MSDS sheets with you to the appointment would be the best bet, more than likely.", "It doesn\u2019t remove for agency, but she doesn\u2019t get to think solely about herself anymore.  If she discussed it with her doctor, she would\u2019ve said so. She obviously didn\u2019t. So, here we are.", "Because it's still his wife's call to make. Raising his worry *once* is fine, but to bring it up repeatedly is crossing the line into AH territory. Simple as that.", "She\u2019s always in charge of her own actions. And is responsible for the repercussions of those actions. But sometimes, especially when pregnant, those repercussions are going to affect people who aren\u2019t herself.", ">Unless stated by a doctor\n\nBingo, he brought up a concern, they should both consult an expert.", "If she wanted to drink alcohol would he be the asshole if he told her not to?", "I completely agree. Honestly I\u2019m more concerned if he\u2019s telling the truth. Because then he himself is a danger to all his workers because he\u2019s not ensuring safe working conditions.", "Because it\u2019s the baby he\u2019s concerned about! Reddit loves to say that pregnant women should be coddled and everything is about them, but the minute a father-to-be is concerned about his partner and their child, he gets told to stop infantilising her??", "I assume the concern is because SHE IS THE ONE WHO IS PREGNANT.  If - god forbid - something should happen to the baby, that would have a massive emotional/psychological impact on her", "I mean I don't think he has any business telling her not to come onto the work site if she judges it an acceptable risk, but pregnancy changes the risk level of many things to the pregnant person too. Pregnancy affects clotting factors, the immune system, elasticity of joints, nutrient availability, and later on coordination as the center of gravity changes.", "JFC. Because she is a grown adult and it would only have hurt her if something went wrong. Now there\u2019s a baby involved and the risk has massively increased.\n\nMy ex used to ride motorbikes. Fine, it\u2019s his call. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019d have let him take our baby on it. Because there was an increased likelihood of something going wrong, and a much higher impact if it did. Therefore an increased risk.\n\nHow is this any different?", "Because while pregnant women are much more at risk health wise than normally. You can\u2019t be unaware of that, it\u2019s basic knowledge.", "It is exclusively her body growing the child, though. She still gets first, last and final say on these decisions. He's allowed to express his discomfort and open that conversation, but it's still her body and life, and he needs to respect regardless of her pregnancy.", "I think he\u2019s making the point that is the commenters on Reddit had the idea to check in with the doctor, this very intelligent, educated woman not only probably had the idea, but probably already talked to her doctor to determine what is and isn\u2019t good for baby.\n\nI get the dad being anxious, but my heavens, the mom is as protective of a baby and often more than the dad usually is. He needs to trust her more.", "BLASPHEMY\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Bringing the MSDS sheets would be a great idea. Telling her she should stop doing a part of her job she enjoys without actually asking the experts is not. Again being pregnant doesn\u2019t remove agency from the pregnant person. He needs to discuss this with her like the adult she is. Maybe she has already done all that, he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s assuming that he knows better then she does.", "He has genuine concerns and can bring them up as much as he wants. \n\nI swear some of you would try to justify a woman drinking while pregnant if a man raised concerns about it", "No, it isn\u2019t his wife\u2019s call. They both get to decide. They are both responsible for the child. It\u2019s as simple as that.", "And a site is safe enough for her to be on", "It\u2019s not a concern. It\u2019s like him being concerned with her eating tomatoes. Going to the doctor with a question about a tomato is redundant", "Holy fuck.. so now he's a liar, incompetent, a danger to his crew, controlling her because he is emasculated by her out earning him, wants to control her.. did I miss anything?\n\nOr is it just possible that you all are psychopaths with deep seated issues against men? Are men not allowed to be overly concerned or protective of their pregnant spouse any longer? I mean I get it, I do trust me I am progressive. However this is fucking ridiculous. He's an expectant father and he's freaking out and being overprotective and that is all. \n\nAnyone who has been a young expectant father I'm sure can identify with that to an extent.", "I think the point implied by OP is that he is concerned about the baby and partner is not. I\u2019m sure she is just as concerned about the baby\u2019s wellbeing and will take steps to be careful. He has voiced his concerns and should trust that she\u2019s being careful.", "But... as a grown woman - doesn't she get to decide if she can take the risk of something happening to HER and the baby and if she can take the emotional impact of miscarrying?  \n\n\nHe never had a problem with her going to the construction site until she was pregnant. Now all of a sudden it's an issue.   \n\n\nDid the dangers of toxic fumes and slips/falls just suddenly appear in the construction industry in the last few months?", "Impact on both of them! She gets the worst of it but he still needs to support her mentally. Its mental anguish for both parents.", "No one is disputing that she gets final say, he\u2019s just raising his concerns", "That's a very immature point of view. \n\nIt's her body, it's their baby. He doesn't get to make decisions for her and more than she can make decisions without taking his concerns seriously.\n\nOnce you become a parent you lose that complete independence. Neither of them gets the luxury of selfish decisions anymore.", "If she did then he needs to let it go. \n\nIf he's that concerned he should have been part of that discussion.", "The problem is, at some point bringing up concerns turns into badgering. He should trust his GF knows what she's doing, and is keeping the risks within acceptable parameters.", "It is her call. As unfair as it is, the child is in her body. She gets to make the call until that child is born", "No, they don't. She's the one carrying it, she's the one who can decide where to go and what to do. He can ask her not to, but that's all he can do. He has no legal, or moral, option to get her to do something she doesn't want to do.", "Oh you\u2019ve visited this site and understand the safety culture there? I haven\u2019t been on a ton of construction sites but I have done other physical labor job. Sometimes, people forgo safely precautions if it makes their job easier.", "You ever been on an active construction site?", "But she simply isn\u2019t as concerned as he is. If she was, then she would be wanting the same level of precautions.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal for two people to have different degrees of worry. But to call him controlling for this is over the top, in my opinion. As far as we can tell, he isn\u2019t trying to isolate her or make her dependant upon him. Just wanting her to take more precautions.\n\nThe other explanation is that she\u2019s scared of losing her identity now that she\u2019s about to become a mother. It\u2019s understandable, I really struggled with those feelings when I was pregnant. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s being unreasonable or controlling. And she needs to find ways to protect her identity as a separate entity that don\u2019t carry the risk of making her baby or herself sick.", "No but those things are much more dangerous if you\u2019re pregnant because you can lose the pregnancy/potentially harm the baby.  Which is the concern here. \n\nAnd yes. Of course it is ultimately her choice. Which is why I mentioned in another comment about educating himself and learning to keep his anxieties in check if she does choose to continue going to the construction sites. There\u2019s not a lot of info given about how many conversations were had about this/what they looked like.  We don\u2019t know whether she\u2019s spoken with her doctor about whether this is something that\u2019s safe for her to do and is making a decision with that info in mind. I am choosing to give op the benefit of the doubt that he\u2019s simply experiencing normal anxiety and expressing concerns because nothing in the post tells me otherwise. I mean it says they \u201cjust found out\u201d she\u2019s pregnant so this can\u2019t have been brought up that many times. As I said above, he\u2019s not TA for being worried and expressing concerns but he absolutely should educate himself on how great a risk this actually is and learn how to keep his anxiety in check because it\u2019s her choice ultimately. Now if he continues pestering her about this/starts trying to actually forbid her, THEN I would say he\u2019s TA", "I'm convinced you aren't actually this daft. But yea let's pretend there isn't a whole bunch of things that are usually safe except when pregnant. Next you'll be like she can drink if she wants to and if you disagree for the baby's health you are controlling.", "It\u2019s true construction sites are super safe, no need to worry", "Over and over and over until she cries...", "Likewise his gf could just be being pigheaded\n\nShe should at least consult her doctor before continuing site work", "Incorrect.  In many states, she can be prosecuted if she is drinking excessively while pregnant.", "It\u2019s his child also. So morally,  he absolutely gets a say. The fact that she is carrying It doesn\u2019t mean anything in that regard. He can even report her for alcohol consumption in many states. Take her ass to jail."]}
