My beautiful girlfriend \"Francesca\" [31F] is a senior engineer on the the project.\n\nWe just discovered Francesca is pregnant and we're both delighted. We haven't made a decision about which of us will take a year out for parental leave, but she'll definitely take the last couple of months before the birth out. She said before that she intends to work as much as she can. \n\nI'm a bit worried about this. Francesca mainly does her thing in the office, but she occasionally goes onto the site to observe the work being done. Like most construction sites, it's full of hazardous dust, chemicals which produce toxic fumes, slip and trip hazards and other dangers. Obviously the workers and Francesca will wear PPE and respiratory protective equipment, but I feel like even then, there's more of a risk to an expectant mother and her unborn child. \n\nBut she doesn't want to be stuck in the office, as she's very passionate about seeing her work being \"brought to life\". I don't see why this is so important. She isn't doing the physical work or managing it, and the site teams produce detailed reports at the end of every shift. Surely that's safer than risking herself and the baby out there? \n\nI was working late yesterday so she got home before me. The topic came up again and turned into an argument. She accused me of \"trying to control her career\" and called me a \"typical construction worker\" who is \"obsessed with being a manly man\". I said that wasn't fair and that I just wanted her and our baby to be safe. She went upstairs in tears and slept in our spare room. \n\nI don't want to control her or her career, I just don't want her or our baby to get hurt. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692879825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1600gui/aita_for_not_wanting_my_pregnant_girlfriend_to_go/", "score": 5289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This includes but is not limited to all of the typical job things they do on the daily. \n\n*I just wanted her and our baby to be safe.*\n\n If safety were such a concern, you would have been talking about it *before* she became pregnant unless you view her now as more of an incubator for the child the two of you created and not her own individual who is the exact same individual as she was before pregnancy.", "You \"feel like\" there is a risk. You are a construction site manager, not a doctor, and not the woman in question. Your feelings here as an expectant father may be understandable but completely and utterly irrelevant. Sorry, YTA here.", "YTA. I understand you have a natural instinct to be protective towards your GF and your baby, but you have to trust your GF's judgement.\n\nIf she's as experienced around a construction site as you suggest, she understands the risks but she also most likely knows how to stay safe on one too.", "YTA, you seem to be saying your aren\u2019t sufficiently good at making your site safe for your girlfriend to work there. I wouldn\u2019t want to be one of the crew there everyday. It\u2019s your job to make the site safe, so do it. Also sounds like your controlling and a bit jealous, so pack that in too.", "YTA. It's not your body. There are legal standards for this, where scientists and doctors have figured out what's safe, and as long as the place is operating within those, she's fine. You don't get to control her body because she's carrying a future child. I know you mean well but it's just not ok to expect her to change her career because of your paranoia. And her not going onsite could have a big impact on her career... she's now seen as the pregnant woman who can't do everything the men can, and sexism is rampant in that industry, as you should know, so you can connect the dots. Just stay out of her decisions and support what she wants to do with this. She's carrying a pregnancy for 9 months and honestly your opinions, especially about her body, are going to have to go on the back burner.", "YTA.

It's hypocritical and misogynistic now.   This is between her and her doctors.  Stop trying to control her.", "YTA. In your mind, you may think that you mean well but you are controlling how and where she works. Also saying things like \"I don't see why this is so important\" when she wants to see the work come to life is dismissive.", "If the construction site was that dangerous to pregnant women it would be noted as such by your health and safety people. Clearly it isn\u2019t. My friend works in a chemical plant and as soon as she found out she was pregnant and disclosed it she was moved to work offsite because of the health and safety regulations. The fact that this is just your feeling and not based on anything else is patronizing and unfair. You don\u2019t get to control her just because you have unfounded worries.  That\u2019s a you problem not a her problem.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is an engineer, not an incubator. You have not valid reason to think your girlfriend is any more at risk now than she was before. Being pregnant does not give you any authority over her body. She is an adult, fully capable of determining her own risk level.

She's wearing PPE and likely in regular consultation with her medical team who likely knows what her job is and what it may typically entail.

It's good to voice your concerns and talk about which precautions she can take.", "YTA. \n\nYour girlfriend should discuss this with her doctor. If her doctor says she is good to go, then she is. If the doctor says she should take certain precautions, she should - but this doesn't really have anything to do with you. That you \"feel\" it is not safe is irrelevant. You are not a doctor. This is about her body and her health, you must trust her judgement. \n\nYou are disrespectful when you say you \"don't see why this is so important\". You should be supporting your girlfriend who is passionate about her job.

She\u2019s a human being, not an incubator.", "YTA, you are an idiot in interfering in the way your girlfriend works. Pregnant women do not need to be wrapped up in cotton wool and are perfectly capable of making decisions about risks.", "YTA. She\u2019s pregnant not disabled. She can continue doing her job until she decides when it\u2019s time to stop.

Her whole body is about to change - organs shifting around to fit the baby, bladder control out the window, feet and ankles swelling to CARRY YOUR CHILD into the world. While she seems happy to have the kid she still would like some normalcy in her life. Especially since your whole world flips upside down after a kid.", "YTA. Unless there is a medical reason not allowing her to be on-site, it is no one's choice but hers to be there. \nYou do not need to understand why it is so important for her to be there, it just is important to her and you need to respect that. \nShe knows her limits better than you do. You can not keep pushing her to follow your advice. best you can do is support her. Let her know you want her to be comfortable and ask if there is something she wants you to do.", "YTA but your heart is in the right place even if your head is in the 50\u2019s.  Apologize.", "YTA. Architect here. \n\nYou\u2019re wife is an engineer and she is actively working and evaluating if buildings are being built to her specifications. \n\nHer being pregnant, especially this early on, is of no concern to you. Typically for onsite days the construction team makes sure things are ready for walk through, so if there are any hazardous chemicals they have you put on PPE and they make sure whoever is checking has been trained on safety procedure and isn\u2019t climbing around unsafe and unsecured locations. \n\nYou can voice your concern once, but what you are asking of her is to stunt her career. Now when she gets further along she will likely be asked to stop. But there is no legitimate reason why she can\u2019t do a field inspection earlier in her pregnancy.", "YTA for the way you handled it. You had totally normal concerns for the safety of your baby, but I think in this case you hyper focused on the extremities of the construction site to force your point and control her behaviour.", "YTA.  If it's ok with Francesca's doc it's ok and it sounds like she's taking all of the necessary precautions.  Apologize and leave it alone.", "YTA. \n\nUnless she climbing a ladder to straddle a beam 10 stories up to bolt things down, there aren't more active dangers on a construction site than there are in every day life. \n\nIf the construction company is licensed and follows the rules, and so does she, there are only very mild dangers, and those same dangers exist everywhere. Yes, they are more hazards on a site, but there is also a safety plan and procedures along with protective gear. \n\nYour girlfriend doesn't cease to become a fully independent human being when she gets pregnant. She isn't only an incubator now, she gets to make decisions and live a daily life, sure, there will be limitations but right now, a construction site isn't one of those limitations. \n\nThe real AH thing here though is your statement about her liking to see her work: \" I don't see why this is so important.\" So you don't understand or value your girlfriend's passions, feelings, or successes? It is important because SHE says it is important. Being pregnant doesn't mean you get to dismiss all the other facets of who she is.", "Of course YTA, she\u2019s having a baby not fighting cancer.

She is competent to be safe bro.  She is a senior engineer. Support her in what SHE wants to do, or get ready to be dumped for being so controlling.  \n\nWhat do you think women that are working do when they get pregnant?? Just quit there jobs or start refusing to do portions of their job?  You are being delusional.  \n\nThe baby will be fine.", "YTA asshole for not sufficiently listening to and supporting her.", "YTA \nAs long as her OB says she can continue living her life as is (with any necessary modifications) she can do whatever she wants.  You have your concerns and that is fine BUT they are overboard and you are reacting out of fear - That is NOT OK.  Ask to go to her next OB appointment and let her know you would like to speak to the OB about your fears.  This way the Dr reassures you and you can back off and relax.", "YTA. She's an adult just like you.", "YTA\n\nAs an engineer too, what the hell are you building that the site is full of hazards and chemicals? Especially in infrastructure, that just seems like a HUGE exaggeration.\n\nI'd definitely understand being concerned if she was working at heights, as she'd be more prone to feeling dizzy and such, but trying to forbid her from going to the site is very controlling.", "If there is physical toxicity at your work, that's true for everyone, including you. Nobody should be breathing in it, let alone a pregnant woman. It doesn't suddenly become healthy for her once she's no longer pregnant, or for you.  Kind of missing the point here.  ETA: YTA, she's not your property and your concern is misplaced.", "Info: Have you guys consulted your doctor? There are 2 sides to this. How you feel and how it actually is.\n\nIve worked construction before and it is a place that's safe when rules are followed. But rules are rarely followed lol. So you might have a point.\n\nWhat does her doc say?", "YTA - not only are you being controlling, but you\u2019re creating an environment where she *might* feel pressured to put herself and her/your baby at risk due to battling egos. *Even if* you don\u2019t feel this way, *she might*. It would be better to emphasize that you trust her to make good decisions for herself and her/your baby. There\u2019s nothing wrong with communicating your concerns however, as long as you leave her in control over her autonomy.", "INFO is it just your opinion or are you telling her what to do. in the end it is her choice and you have to respect that,  but you are allowed your opinion. \n\nalso do you not trust her to be able to take care of herself and the baby ? what has changed that she is suddenly less capable of taking care of herself ? do women suddenly become dumber when they get pregnant,  or lose the ability to keep themselves safe ?", "YTA If it was about safety concerns instead of control then you wouldn't be starting fights because she's not obeying what you want. Your \"worry\" isn't coming off like it's anything but controlling.\n\nWith proper PPE it is completely safe for her to continue her on site work.", "You mean well, but...\n\nYes, you are controlling and you need to calm down.\n\nIf you begin to see lions behind every tree now, just because she is pregnant, you are going to drive her nuts.\n\nIf you never had a problem before you shouldn't have one now.\nShe can manage perfectly well", "In the UK, once a woman notifies her employer that she is pregnant they need to carry out a risk assessment to identify hazards, accommodations etc. This is a legal requirement even for a desk job in an office block, let alone for being on a construction site.\n\nIf the risk assessment clears her to carry on, then she is free to carry on. If the risk assessment says she mustn't enter certain areas, her employer has a duty of care to ensure that she doesn't (within reason, I'm not suggesting physical restraint!)\n\nI don't know where you are based but given that you're somewhere allowing a year's parental leave I expect you have a similar requirement.\n\nI don't know if you being site manager makes you her boss, but regardless I'd advise you to have any assessment carried out by an independent party to avoid any accusations of bias and to protect your work and personal relationships.\n\nI get why you are concerned but the way you are currently handling this, YTA.", "YTA. How do other women in the company/business handle the situation?\n\nUnless there are specific health and safety regulations for pregnant women in your industry, it's entirely her choice. You voiced your concerns as a worried father-to-be, that's all you can do. Continue arguing and you'll be a bigger asshole every time.", "I knew exactly where this was going before I even opened the post \nYTA\nYour girlfriend didn't just turn into an incubator the moment she got pregnant.

Addressing it once is fine, repeatedly is uncalled for.", "Soft YTA. \n\nIf you are really coming from a place of concern, that is sweet. But it turns into controlling behavior when you\u2019ve asked a question, it\u2019s been answered and you keep pressing. \n\nYour partner is wanting your support. She wants to be the woman who keeps working. Your job right now is to support her and help her find ways to accomplish her goal, not tell her to go sit at the desk ask day (which by the way, is NOT healthier for pregnant women. It is much better to be up and moving with your blood flowing than being sedentary unless advised otherwise by a doctor.) \n\nWhat can you do to support her? Make sure the work site is safe. Be on everyone\u2019s ass about safety so she is walking into the safest site possible. If you want to control things, control your site and make sure every safety rule is being followed to the T. You can also do things like make sure she has new clean filters for her respirator, make sure she has quality work boots to wear on site, make sure her other safety equipment is in top shape. \n\nContinuing to work as she normally would is very important to her. You don\u2019t have to understand it, but if you want to be a good partner you will do what you need to do to support her. She works in a male dominated industry where there is a lot of stigma against women, especially pregnant women and working moms.

I certainly understand the baby concern, especially since it sounds like your first kid.\n\nHowever, you also can't lock her in a tower until the kid arrives. How truly hazardous is the work site? Perhaps you could do an abbreviated tour and avoid the really bad areas? As the manager, perhaps you could take a few extra steps on that day to make sure it's a bit safer.", "NTA, these comments are crazy. You are very much allowed to be concerned for your *unborn child*. So many things could happen to a fetus in the early stages and it\u2019s better to simply play it safe. The air quality is not the only safety hazard here, there could be fires, falling debris, tripping hazards, electricity and more. You aren\u2019t even asking her to throw away her entire career by just asking her to steer clear of probably one of the more dangerous places for *anyone*, never mind someone pregnant with your own kid. This request also is not as absurd since she already doesn\u2019t spend much time there anyway.", "YTA.  No concern at all about physical work and standard dust.  However, if there are chemicals being used actively, she/her manager and or your occupational health staff need to look at the SDS and check the hazards and PPE requirements.  No one should be around chemicals without completing Right-To-Know and exposure training.  Most personal chemical hazards come from skin/eye/etc contact and then from inhalation.\n\nThere are some solvents that she should avoid since she is pregnant, but most \"chemical fumes\" are relatively harmless if you are outdoors and already wearing PPE.", "YTA. She is pregnant, not an invalid. She's also an adult and is therefore able to make her own decisions. She may later decide that she doesn't think it's a good idea to be on site, or she may not. Either way, it's her decision.", "I'm in the minority here, but NTA. I just had my first baby and we were extremely careful about exposures including chemical and noise exposure. It sounds like she can still do her overall job from the office. Maybe since she is fixated on it a compromise would be her looking at the sites when they aren't active (prior to the workers starting for the day)? \n\nYes, consult her doctor, but they gave pregnant women thalidomide till we found out that was a bad idea. Sometimes we don't know what is safe in pregnancy till it's too late. \n\nI know there are a lot of Y T A votes \"her body\" etc., but for those who plan to keep their pregnancies, my personal thought is you start looking out for your child during pregnancy. I want my child to be as healthy as possible. I don't want to look back if they have a syndrome or illness and wonder if it was a stupid choice I made that caused them to suffer.", "DNTA, you're natural instinct is to protect your fiance and unborn baby.\n\nI can only suggest you speak to her about it again.  if she really wants to go, you may just have to let her.  \n\nIf the PPE etc is in place as i am sure it will be, i doubt there will be any harm done.\n\nsuccessful relationships need both partners to compromise, this might be your turn.", "You're the asshole until an accident happens and hurts the unborn baby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You need to trust she is doing everything she can to protect this baby and herself as well. \n\nPlease talk to her about this. Tell her your concerns (not in a controlling way.

Speaking as a woman who is currently pregnant (2nd baby), there is a necessary process of adapting to the realities of pregnancy and the normal risk calculation does have to change. You have to reassess previously normal activities - like eating unpasteurised cheese. This does not mean assuming fragility or infantilising pregnant women - eg I\u2019m still lifting weights at the gym and working my demanding job normally. But for my first pregnancy, I had to consider whether I could travel for work as normal to parts of the world with low but real risks of malaria, dengue and zika, along with general issues around food and water safety. I decided, with discussions with my partner, that it was not worth the risk. \n\nIt is also normal to make decisions about my health and my unborn baby\u2019s health with my husband. Why would we not? We are his family and he is mine. In the same way, I have a say in his lifestyle choices (eg healthy living, exercise) because they affect him, me and our family.\n\nOP is not being an AH to have questions and concerns, especially since he knows first hand the risks of the site. Francesca is not an AH to want to carry on with her life normally for as long as possible (being transformed from an autonomous individual into a mother can be a dehumanising/alienating experience and she is probably feeling some knee jerk reactions of being trapped and controlled. She may also not be ready to tell her workplace, especially if (as it would) she is in the first trimester). Personally, I did not tell my workplace about either pregnancy until after the 20 week anomaly scan. \n\nTo me, OP and Francesca need to sit down and have a calm, evidence based conversation about the general risks of the site, whether, how and when Francesca\u2019s individual risk might increase because of pregnancy or later stages of pregnancy (eg, by about 5/6 months the size of the foetus can affect balance, and from about 7 months the belly usually blocks view of your own feet, making a slip/trip a bit more likely), and the extent to which the level of harm has increased because of pregnancy. From about 5/6 months the foetus is bigger and less protected by the pelvis and abdominal wall, and a hard slip/fall could potentially be more serious for mother and baby (unless very bad, I doubt a slip or fall would affect her or the baby in the first trimester, baby is tiny and well protected.)  Whilst pregnant, our immune systems also tend to be weaker, and she may find herself suffering more discomfort from accidental dust / particle inhalation than she usually would. However it sounds like that risk can be addressed through proper use of PPE.\n\nSo, NAH yet, but OP should make sure that he is not being knee jerk in his position, that he is taking an evidence and risk-based approach, and should keep in mind that Francesca is going through a massive mental and physical adjustment right now and support her in keeping on feeling like herself, not just \u201cmum\u201d.", "I was leading Field Botany field trips when I was 8 months pregnant. \n\nMy research involved a scanning electron microscope (an X-ray emitter).

Struck by crushing and caught on/in-between are things that could happen to her regardless of pregnancy. electrocution is a risk that is not affected by pregnancy. So if the site is not safe enough for a pregnant woman in the fatal 4 categories, its probably not safe for ANYONE. \n\nWearing PPE to protect from dust particulates is appropriate for anyone, regardless of if they are pregnant, unless she has additional health complications that make a face mask unsafe to wear. but that would be the same regardless of if a person was pregnant or not.

Calm down a bit, by the time it becomes actually not advisable for her to check in the construction, she's probably gonna be off for maternity leave already.\nSupport her, love her and understand her, everything is gonna be alright.\n\nAnd congratulations, btw :)", "NTA. Whilst she is passionate about her job and visiting the construction site, it doesn't excuse the fact she'll be at a very crucial time in the baby's development and if something were to happen, then what situation would you and your girlfriend be in?", "NAH. You are concerned about your future child\u2019s health, that makes sense. And I get her stance\u2014pregnancy is rough, exhausting, painful, there\u2019s a million things you can\u2019t eat or do, and she\u2019s concerned about her career and likely anxious of how her pregnancy and eventual motherhood will affect that. I\u2019d say you guys just need to be understanding towards each other and go together to speak with her doctor about these concerns.", "NAH I think it is okay to be concerned about your partner health. Sometimes I tell my husband when his medicine needs refill, and push him to go to the doctor to check on his medical condition(s) status.  He also do the same when it comes to my health, he always push me to make good health decisions. Specially mental health, since being a PhD student is so hard on me. \nI think it is normal that couples gives each other advice and concern about each other health, even without pregnancy.", "NTA. You\u2019re just new to this. Give it time and you\u2019ll see pregnancy does not turn women into delicate flowers. She will not become a clumsy weeble wobble until she\u2019s about ready to pop. \n\nYou\u2019re just so excited and want to protect them both. It\u2019s cute, but 100% unnecessary\u2026and it will definitely make your girlfriend angry so I suggest you chill. She\u2019ll be good. So will the baby. \n\nCongrats, dad!", "NTA, but also understand that it is her choice to ultimately make so regardless be supportive of her the best you can without being controlling or an asshole", "NAH!\nI completely understand your concern. Do some research and have a kind rational conversation together as much as is possible to decide what is best for you as a family. I wish you three the best :)", "NTA. You both want the same thing - to be safe and in love with a wonderful new baby and to maintain your careers - but see different ways to get it. I didn\u2019t see particular red flags in your post. It\u2019s good to care. Work on communicating clearly and listening lovingly. This is a normal disagreement to have and work through. Best of luck!", "If you are so concerned, ask if you can go with to her Ob appointment and voice your concerns. If you are wrong, the Ob will tell you and you should drop it.", "Check your company\u2019s policies, pregnant women may not be allowed on site due to insurance reasons.", "you are not the asshole. you shouldn't mow the lawn while you're pregnant, you most likely shouldn't manage a construction site while pregnant either.", "NTA, she\u2019s at increased risks of fainting and falling in the first trimester.  She\u2019s being reckless and any exposure to toxic fumes or slips and fall could cause birth defects or miscarriage.  There are so many things that can go wrong with pregnancy, those cells are dividing and growing so quickly they\u2019re more susceptible to health hazards, and you\u2019re immuno-compromised during pregnancy on top of it all so can injuries have a greater chance of getting infected. OP you\u2019re not controlling, you\u2019re careful and caring.  You\u2019re number one priority while carrying another life you\u2019re building is protecting them so you don\u2019t put their health and body at risk and make their life more difficult.", "Ugh\n\nSooooo many people jumping this poor guy.\n\nMy friend, I'll say NTA.\n\nI'll bet it's the first kid. This is ALWAYS a thing that causes parents to be to be \"extra\".  Don't eat this, don't bend over, don't get less than x amount of sleep because the baby books say so.\n\nYour concerns are valid. It's your kid too, and let's be honest if the kid were born with some sort of issue as a result it would he a huge burden financially, psychologically,  and could end a marriage.\n\nThat said, it's also her kid.  I can't think she would do anything to sabotage the child's wellbeing. \n\nWhat is happening is both of your parental instincts are kicking in. You're being protective which honestly is a father's natural instinct.\n\nSomehow it's coming off to her as controlling though.  Idk if she's far along enough yet for her hormones to be getting out of whack, or if there was just a misunderstanding in the conversation. \n\nWhat I would recommend is the two of you sitting down and TALKING, not arguing, this way you can voice your concerns and she can voice hers.\n\nThis is just one of many issues you'll have to deal with as parents so might as well develop this skill now before the child arrives. \n\nCongrats on your new addition to the family!", "NTA. It\u2019s very common for women to want to be as independent as possible and have no alterations made based on gender. However, that isn\u2019t fair to the kid. Being exposed to all that shit *is* concerning, you\u2019re just being a good father. She\u2019s taking feminism to an extreme and abandoning common sense out of a desire for equality. I get it, but also not cool. \n\nSigned, a health conscious feminist", "Especially with uncommon chemicals, no, she doesn't understand the risks, noone currently alive understands the risks. The rule of thumb applies: If you've never eaten it it's effects have not been studied. Academia is in a constant state of being underfunded and the effects of everything not incredibly common on the human body are unknown. Not even mentioning the potential effects on a fetus.\n\nThe only thing that can be done and should be done is ask the company about safety protocols and meet an independent professional to discuss what potential risks ARE known. (Another rule of thumb: If lawsuits are cheaper than safety and you trust your boss you'll get cancer)", "Have you been to a construction site? Wtf?", "Okay... To put my cards on the table I think the best course of action here is for Fran to have a conversation with doctor or other medical professional to decide if there is any issue here.\n\nI simply don't know enough about construction work to pretend to know what the dangers are. I certainly think there are some jobs where the pregnant woman should absolutely not just be treated as any other person. For example I think we could probably agree that if Fran was a boxer, or an astronaut or a miriad of other weird and wonderful jobs then it probably would not be appropriate to continue in the role. Simply put, I think this is one to be decided between medical and health and safety professionals.", "But if it was the other way around everyone would be lighting him up for ignoring her concerns. Everyone a moron", "And let's not forget that their body is suddenly public property, and any people can just walk to her and touch her belly. Or that's how it seems.\n\nAs long as she wears all protections that are designed to keep people who work long hours in those conditions healthy, while she stays only a short time, she should be perfectly safe.", "A lot of places I have worked safety measures are rammed down your throat but then as soon as those measures arnt convenient and will slow the job down they will try and get you to break them", "Architect and currently pregnant - it's very safe. I just have to be a bit more careful and I've made sure everyone on site knows so that when I'm there we have to use the stairs, not the external ramp up etc. I go to my main site at least once a week (and it's a big hospital project so very busy) and not once felt unsafe. As architects and engineers we undertake so much safety training and site training that a lot of this shit is ingrained in us.", "Agreed! Also in a related field and doing engineering. My sites involve a lot of working along railroad tracks. I didn't miss a site visit until 35ish weeks, and that was down to Mobile, AL in summer heat. I took care of myself and knew my limitations. If he trusts her so little before the kid is born, how will he be able to trust her when it comes to the rest of their lives after they're born?", "As a fellow construction manager... I'd be concerned if the site is so unsafe that a member of the site team, who is working there every day, would be at risk by walking around. What happens when the architect rocks up in their office shoes, or the client wants to walk around? OP should stick in his lane. Site safety is his responsibility, if it's not safe fix the problems, don't micromanage the rest of the team.", "The pregnant woman may be fine but the unborn child may not. \n\nUnpasteurized cheese is safe for the guys but not for the fetus.\n\nA shit ton of medications are fine for people but not for pregnant people.\n\nAlcohol isn\u2019t exactly safe for anyone but an adult likely won\u2019t have any issues unless they drink way too much, whereas a fetus may end up being born with FAS from a \u201csafe\u201d quantity.\n\nIt\u2019s not rocket science to know that if you plan on carrying a child to term there is a different risk assessment to everything if you don\u2019t want to either lose the child or have the kid born with issues.", "What people don't realize about construction sites, including every goddamn person here claiming to work on construction sites, is that there are many many many trip hazards. Sure a quick trip or stumble won't hurt a guy or a girl, but all it takes is one landing on your pregnant belly to fuck everything up. Reddit is full of deranged teens/women who believe any suggestion from a guy is asshole controlling behavior.", "Fellow woman who works at an accelerator (Hi), at my place of work in Germany I had to hand in my dosimiter when I let them know about my pregnancy and had my acess card permissions removed for any exclusion zones. I can acess some of our testing areas but only when testing is not on going. \n\nWe had several meetings about how to accommodate me for our high power coupler testing (they are my other babies) and we agreed on me helping with set up and assembly as much as possible but since ce testing would be done in a bunker, I would run the conditioning from 1 building over and be paired with someone who had acess to the building the bunker was in on the off chance something happened.  \n\nMy midwife wanted me to be on home office for most of my pregnancy but she doesn't know the site and the risks like me. To be fair the biggest issue was that my office is somewhat of a greenhouse and in June was reaching 37C by 2pm, I solved that by working in the lab or doing on site mornings and home office afternoons.", "Feeling scared is not a reason to issue orders to others.", "Dude them insinuating that the OP sees his own wife as an incubator is so fucked up. What the actual fuck is wrong with this sub.", "UNDERRATED COMMENT", "Yeah this sub I'm learning is very sexist.", "Oh wow! Is that standard practice at accelerators in Germany? My experience is purely US based.", "I have only seen two posts from this sub, each time the comments have been incredibly sexist.\n\nYour comment is the first reasonable one I've seen be upvoted.", "Yeah he\u2019s going about it the wrong way & needs to understand that his worries don\u2019t mean she needs to stop going on site so long as she takes precautions (if he\u2019s really that worried, he can ask or have her ask the doctor at her next OB appointment to have them assuage his concerns), but the idea that it\u2019s inherently misogynistic to have increased anxiety or worries about a pregnant SO is over the top. I\u2019m a raging feminist but this is a bridge too far for me.", "Totally agree with you. I saw those comments and thought whoa, really taking it to the extreme here. OP's post didn't give off that vibe at all, I just thought he sounded like a worried, concerned husband. Not an evil, controlling man.", "And, \u2018it came up again,\u2019 implies this is not the first time he\u2019s voiced these concerns. How often is he bringing it up?  What does he need her to do/say to help him feel confident she\u2019s taking it as seriously as he is?  Does she feel nagged and undermined? Obviously his way of talking to her about this issue isn\u2019t conveying what he wants it to convey, or they would be on the same page already.", "They most likely have discussed her job, and safety measures. My ob/gyn knows what my job is, and I'm done having kids. But it's on file in case something crops up problem wise.", "Yeah id say the reasonable solution here is talking with a doctor and maybe doing some research on their own together. If the doctor says she\u2019s fine to continue doing what she does and OP disagrees then he would be the asshole. But simply raising concerns shouldn\u2019t be met with this sort of response\u2026", "Or he is just controlling and won\u2019t respect her decision. Bringing it up over and over after she\u2019s made a decision is controlling behaviour", "Why would you assume she hasn't spoken to a doctor? She's PREGNANT. What I think what we can safely assume is that OP has spent much less time thinking about, speaking to doctors about, and *knowing about* carrying a fetus.", "So the guy who is A CONSTRUCTION SITE MANAGER knows less about the hazards on the construction site than the OFFICE PERSONNEL who have no need to be on site at all and have no actual duties on site either? Ok.", "What and if something happened to him on site you don\u2019t think that \u201cwould have a massive emotional/psychological impact on her\u201d and the baby?\n\nIt it\u2019s so dangerous for her to visit site occasionally then he shouldn\u2019t be there since it\u2019s so unsafe to be at, let alone work at daily", "Also something can happen to her!
