My beautiful girlfriend \"Francesca\" [31F] is a senior engineer on the the project.\n\nWe just discovered Francesca is pregnant and we're both delighted. We haven't made a decision about which of us will take a year out for parental leave, but she'll definitely take the last couple of months before the birth out. She said before that she intends to work as much as she can. \n\nI'm a bit worried about this. Francesca mainly does her thing in the office, but she occasionally goes onto the site to observe the work being done. Like most construction sites, it's full of hazardous dust, chemicals which produce toxic fumes, slip and trip hazards and other dangers. Obviously the workers and Francesca will wear PPE and respiratory protective equipment, but I feel like even then, there's more of a risk to an expectant mother and her unborn child. \n\nBut she doesn't want to be stuck in the office, as she's very passionate about seeing her work being \"brought to life\". I don't see why this is so important. She isn't doing the physical work or managing it, and the site teams produce detailed reports at the end of every shift. Surely that's safer than risking herself and the baby out there? \n\nI was working late yesterday so she got home before me. The topic came up again and turned into an argument. She accused me of \"trying to control her career\" and called me a \"typical construction worker\" who is \"obsessed with being a manly man\". I said that wasn't fair and that I just wanted her and our baby to be safe. She went upstairs in tears and slept in our spare room. \n\nI don't want to control her or her career, I just don't want her or our baby to get hurt. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692879825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1600gui/aita_for_not_wanting_my_pregnant_girlfriend_to_go/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This includes but is not limited to all of the typical job things they do on the daily. \n\n*I just wanted her and our baby to be safe.*\n\n If safety were such a concern, you would have been talking about it *before* she became pregnant unless you view her now as more of an incubator for the child the two of you created and not her own individual who is the exact same individual as she was before pregnancy.", "You \"feel like\" there is a risk. You are a construction site manager, not a doctor, and not the woman in question. Your feelings here as an expectant father may be understandable but completely and utterly irrelevant. Sorry, YTA here.", "YTA. I understand you have a natural instinct to be protective towards your GF and your baby, but you have to trust your GF's judgement.\n\nIf she's as experienced around a construction site as you suggest, she understands the risks but she also most likely knows how to stay safe on one too.", "YTA, you seem to be saying your aren\u2019t sufficiently good at making your site safe for your girlfriend to work there. I wouldn\u2019t want to be one of the crew there everyday. It\u2019s your job to make the site safe, so do it. Also sounds like your controlling and a bit jealous, so pack that in too.", "YTA. It's not your body. There are legal standards for this, where scientists and doctors have figured out what's safe, and as long as the place is operating within those, she's fine. You don't get to control her body because she's carrying a future child. I know you mean well but it's just not ok to expect her to change her career because of your paranoia. And her not going onsite could have a big impact on her career... she's now seen as the pregnant woman who can't do everything the men can, and sexism is rampant in that industry, as you should know, so you can connect the dots. Just stay out of her decisions and support what she wants to do with this. She's carrying a pregnancy for 9 months and honestly your opinions, especially about her body, are going to have to go on the back burner.", "YTA.

Respect her decision and quit arguing with her.", "YTA. It's her body, not yours.  You didn't seem to have a problem with her going in the field before her pregnancy.   It's hypocritical and misogynistic now.   This is between her and her doctors.  Stop trying to control her.", "YTA. In your mind, you may think that you mean well but you are controlling how and where she works. Also saying things like \"I don't see why this is so important\" when she wants to see the work come to life is dismissive.", "If the construction site was that dangerous to pregnant women it would be noted as such by your health and safety people. Clearly it isn\u2019t. My friend works in a chemical plant and as soon as she found out she was pregnant and disclosed it she was moved to work offsite because of the health and safety regulations. The fact that this is just your feeling and not based on anything else is patronizing and unfair. You don\u2019t get to control her just because you have unfounded worries.  That\u2019s a you problem not a her problem.", "YTA. Your girlfriend is an engineer, not an incubator. You have not valid reason to think your girlfriend is any more at risk now than she was before. Being pregnant does not give you any authority over her body. She is an adult, fully capable of determining her own risk level.

She's wearing PPE and likely in regular consultation with her medical team who likely knows what her job is and what it may typically entail.

It's good to voice your concerns and talk about which precautions she can take.", "YTA. \n\nYour girlfriend should discuss this with her doctor. If her doctor says she is good to go, then she is. If the doctor says she should take certain precautions, she should - but this doesn't really have anything to do with you. That you \"feel\" it is not safe is irrelevant. You are not a doctor. This is about her body and her health, you must trust her judgement. \n\nYou are disrespectful when you say you \"don't see why this is so important\". You should be supporting your girlfriend who is passionate about her job.

She\u2019s a human being, not an incubator.", "YTA, you are an idiot in interfering in the way your girlfriend works. Pregnant women do not need to be wrapped up in cotton wool and are perfectly capable of making decisions about risks.", "YTA. She\u2019s pregnant not disabled. She can continue doing her job until she decides when it\u2019s time to stop.

Her whole body is about to change - organs shifting around to fit the baby, bladder control out the window, feet and ankles swelling to CARRY YOUR CHILD into the world. While she seems happy to have the kid she still would like some normalcy in her life. Especially since your whole world flips upside down after a kid.", "YTA. Unless there is a medical reason not allowing her to be on-site, it is no one's choice but hers to be there. \nYou do not need to understand why it is so important for her to be there, it just is important to her and you need to respect that. \nShe knows her limits better than you do. You can not keep pushing her to follow your advice. best you can do is support her. Let her know you want her to be comfortable and ask if there is something she wants you to do.", "YTA but your heart is in the right place even if your head is in the 50\u2019s.  Apologize.", "YTA. Architect here. \n\nYou\u2019re wife is an engineer and she is actively working and evaluating if buildings are being built to her specifications. \n\nHer being pregnant, especially this early on, is of no concern to you. Typically for onsite days the construction team makes sure things are ready for walk through, so if there are any hazardous chemicals they have you put on PPE and they make sure whoever is checking has been trained on safety procedure and isn\u2019t climbing around unsafe and unsecured locations. \n\nYou can voice your concern once, but what you are asking of her is to stunt her career. Now when she gets further along she will likely be asked to stop. But there is no legitimate reason why she can\u2019t do a field inspection earlier in her pregnancy.", "YTA for the way you handled it. You had totally normal concerns for the safety of your baby, but I think in this case you hyper focused on the extremities of the construction site to force your point and control her behaviour.", "YTA.  If it's ok with Francesca's doc it's ok and it sounds like she's taking all of the necessary precautions.  Apologize and leave it alone.", "YTA. \n\nUnless she climbing a ladder to straddle a beam 10 stories up to bolt things down, there aren't more active dangers on a construction site than there are in every day life. \n\nIf the construction company is licensed and follows the rules, and so does she, there are only very mild dangers, and those same dangers exist everywhere. Yes, they are more hazards on a site, but there is also a safety plan and procedures along with protective gear. \n\nYour girlfriend doesn't cease to become a fully independent human being when she gets pregnant. She isn't only an incubator now, she gets to make decisions and live a daily life, sure, there will be limitations but right now, a construction site isn't one of those limitations. \n\nThe real AH thing here though is your statement about her liking to see her work: \" I don't see why this is so important.\" So you don't understand or value your girlfriend's passions, feelings, or successes? It is important because SHE says it is important. Being pregnant doesn't mean you get to dismiss all the other facets of who she is.", "Of course YTA, she\u2019s having a baby not fighting cancer.

She is competent to be safe bro.  She is a senior engineer. Support her in what SHE wants to do, or get ready to be dumped for being so controlling.  \n\nWhat do you think women that are working do when they get pregnant?? Just quit there jobs or start refusing to do portions of their job?  You are being delusional.  \n\nThe baby will be fine.", "YTA asshole for not sufficiently listening to and supporting her.", "YTA \nAs long as her OB says she can continue living her life as is (with any necessary modifications) she can do whatever she wants.  You have your concerns and that is fine BUT they are overboard and you are reacting out of fear - That is NOT OK.  Ask to go to her next OB appointment and let her know you would like to speak to the OB about your fears.  This way the Dr reassures you and you can back off and relax.", "YTA. She's an adult just like you.", "YTA\n\nAs an engineer too, what the hell are you building that the site is full of hazards and chemicals? Especially in infrastructure, that just seems like a HUGE exaggeration.\n\nI'd definitely understand being concerned if she was working at heights, as she'd be more prone to feeling dizzy and such, but trying to forbid her from going to the site is very controlling.", "If there is physical toxicity at your work, that's true for everyone, including you. Nobody should be breathing in it, let alone a pregnant woman. It doesn't suddenly become healthy for her once she's no longer pregnant, or for you.  Kind of missing the point here.  ETA: YTA, she's not your property and your concern is misplaced.", "Info: Have you guys consulted your doctor? There are 2 sides to this. How you feel and how it actually is.\n\nIve worked construction before and it is a place that's safe when rules are followed. But rules are rarely followed lol. So you might have a point.\n\nWhat does her doc say?", "YTA - not only are you being controlling, but you\u2019re creating an environment where she *might* feel pressured to put herself and her/your baby at risk due to battling egos. *Even if* you don\u2019t feel this way, *she might*. It would be better to emphasize that you trust her to make good decisions for herself and her/your baby. There\u2019s nothing wrong with communicating your concerns however, as long as you leave her in control over her autonomy.", "INFO is it just your opinion or are you telling her what to do. in the end it is her choice and you have to respect that,  but you are allowed your opinion. \n\nalso do you not trust her to be able to take care of herself and the baby ? what has changed that she is suddenly less capable of taking care of herself ? do women suddenly become dumber when they get pregnant,  or lose the ability to keep themselves safe ?", "YTA If it was about safety concerns instead of control then you wouldn't be starting fights because she's not obeying what you want. Your \"worry\" isn't coming off like it's anything but controlling.\n\nWith proper PPE it is completely safe for her to continue her on site work.", "You mean well, but...\n\nYes, you are controlling and you need to calm down.\n\nIf you begin to see lions behind every tree now, just because she is pregnant, you are going to drive her nuts.\n\nIf you never had a problem before you shouldn't have one now.\nShe can manage perfectly well", "In the UK, once a woman notifies her employer that she is pregnant they need to carry out a risk assessment to identify hazards, accommodations etc. This is a legal requirement even for a desk job in an office block, let alone for being on a construction site.\n\nIf the risk assessment clears her to carry on, then she is free to carry on. If the risk assessment says she mustn't enter certain areas, her employer has a duty of care to ensure that she doesn't (within reason, I'm not suggesting physical restraint!)\n\nI don't know where you are based but given that you're somewhere allowing a year's parental leave I expect you have a similar requirement.\n\nI don't know if you being site manager makes you her boss, but regardless I'd advise you to have any assessment carried out by an independent party to avoid any accusations of bias and to protect your work and personal relationships.\n\nI get why you are concerned but the way you are currently handling this, YTA.", "YTA. How do other women in the company/business handle the situation?\n\nUnless there are specific health and safety regulations for pregnant women in your industry, it's entirely her choice. You voiced your concerns as a worried father-to-be, that's all you can do. Continue arguing and you'll be a bigger asshole every time.", "I knew exactly where this was going before I even opened the post \nYTA\nYour girlfriend didn't just turn into an incubator the moment she got pregnant.

She knows what she\u2019s doing, she knows how to protect herself & the baby, and if she has any concerns or questions, she knows how to ask her doctor! Addressing it once is fine, repeatedly is uncalled for.", "Soft YTA. \n\nIf you are really coming from a place of concern, that is sweet. But it turns into controlling behavior when you\u2019ve asked a question, it\u2019s been answered and you keep pressing. \n\nYour partner is wanting your support. She wants to be the woman who keeps working. Your job right now is to support her and help her find ways to accomplish her goal, not tell her to go sit at the desk ask day (which by the way, is NOT healthier for pregnant women. It is much better to be up and moving with your blood flowing than being sedentary unless advised otherwise by a doctor.) \n\nWhat can you do to support her? Make sure the work site is safe. Be on everyone\u2019s ass about safety so she is walking into the safest site possible. If you want to control things, control your site and make sure every safety rule is being followed to the T. You can also do things like make sure she has new clean filters for her respirator, make sure she has quality work boots to wear on site, make sure her other safety equipment is in top shape. \n\nContinuing to work as she normally would is very important to her. You don\u2019t have to understand it, but if you want to be a good partner you will do what you need to do to support her. She works in a male dominated industry where there is a lot of stigma against women, especially pregnant women and working moms.

I certainly understand the baby concern, especially since it sounds like your first kid.\n\nHowever, you also can't lock her in a tower until the kid arrives. How truly hazardous is the work site? Perhaps you could do an abbreviated tour and avoid the really bad areas? As the manager, perhaps you could take a few extra steps on that day to make sure it's a bit safer.", "NTA, these comments are crazy. You are very much allowed to be concerned for your *unborn child*. So many things could happen to a fetus in the early stages and it\u2019s better to simply play it safe. The air quality is not the only safety hazard here, there could be fires, falling debris, tripping hazards, electricity and more. You aren\u2019t even asking her to throw away her entire career by just asking her to steer clear of probably one of the more dangerous places for *anyone*, never mind someone pregnant with your own kid. This request also is not as absurd since she already doesn\u2019t spend much time there anyway.", "YTA.  No concern at all about physical work and standard dust.  However, if there are chemicals being used actively, she/her manager and or your occupational health staff need to look at the SDS and check the hazards and PPE requirements.  No one should be around chemicals without completing Right-To-Know and exposure training.  Most personal chemical hazards come from skin/eye/etc contact and then from inhalation.\n\nThere are some solvents that she should avoid since she is pregnant, but most \"chemical fumes\" are relatively harmless if you are outdoors and already wearing PPE.", "YTA. She is pregnant, not an invalid. She's also an adult and is therefore able to make her own decisions. She may later decide that she doesn't think it's a good idea to be on site, or she may not. Either way, it's her decision.", "I'm in the minority here, but NTA. I just had my first baby and we were extremely careful about exposures including chemical and noise exposure. It sounds like she can still do her overall job from the office. Maybe since she is fixated on it a compromise would be her looking at the sites when they aren't active (prior to the workers starting for the day)? \n\nYes, consult her doctor, but they gave pregnant women thalidomide till we found out that was a bad idea. Sometimes we don't know what is safe in pregnancy till it's too late. \n\nI know there are a lot of Y T A votes \"her body\" etc., but for those who plan to keep their pregnancies, my personal thought is you start looking out for your child during pregnancy. I want my child to be as healthy as possible. I don't want to look back if they have a syndrome or illness and wonder if it was a stupid choice I made that caused them to suffer.", "DNTA, you're natural instinct is to protect your fiance and unborn baby.\n\nI can only suggest you speak to her about it again.  if she really wants to go, you may just have to let her.  \n\nIf the PPE etc is in place as i am sure it will be, i doubt there will be any harm done.\n\nsuccessful relationships need both partners to compromise, this might be your turn.", "You're the asshole until an accident happens and hurts the unborn baby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't see why this is so important. She isn't doing the physical work or managing it, and the site teams produce detailed reports at the end of every shift. Surely that's safer than risking herself and the baby out there? \n\nI was working late yesterday so she got home before me. The topic came up again and turned into an argument.

You need to trust she is doing everything she can to protect this baby and herself as well. \n\nPlease talk to her about this. Tell her your concerns (not in a controlling way.

I understand you're concerned for her/the baby's safety, but I hope you can see that bringing it up only now that she's pregnant, (when it was never a concern before), could seem a little patronizing to her. She's an adult, don't you think she's just as concerned over the baby's safety as you are? Trust in her as a partner, a mother, AND a senior engineer. Congratulations to you both!", "YTA. She is capable of being aware of and protecting her own body. YTA", "YTA.\n\nThe sites should do a safety risk assessment for her condition and any safety issues be mitigated. That's standard practice, which you should be well aware of.", "I get that you\u2019re worried but she\u2019s pregnant not in a coma. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s aware that she\u2019s pregnant and if she\u2019s walking in a construction site she\u2019s going to be careful about where she\u2019s walking and if she\u2019s wearing the masks and all the protective gear necessary to be in the site, what\u2019s the problem? \n\nJust because she\u2019s pregnant doesn\u2019t mean she has to now stop her life and be stuck in an office. If this was such a big worry for you, why wasn\u2019t it an issue before she got pregnant? \n\nSigned by an 8 month pregnant with twins 25 year old adult thats still capable of living her life (with certain limitations at this point of my pregnancy) without staying within 4 walls all because she\u2019s carrying two other humans.", "This is a tough one. Been pregnant before so I understand how it is. You\u2019re trying hard to make sure you\u2019re not exposing the baby to anything harmful. At the same time, it\u2019s on her to control that. You can bring up concerns but it\u2019s how you do it that matters.\nIf there are that many dangers and fumes I don\u2019t understand either why she would go there regularly. I get that she doesn\u2019t want a career setback, but she also committed to growing a new life and when you commit to something like that, it\u2019s important to make sure it\u2019s done to the best of your ability.", "I said this below. But I\u2019m an architect and a woman and if I became pregnant I wouldn\u2019t stop doing site visits until it was deemed unsafe by my team and the construction manager. Until then construction sites are actually very safe. There is safety training one participates in, PPe on site, one typically comes in a hard hat and proper attire and the construction team coordinate so that the engineers and architects aren\u2019t coming on days where hazardous materials are being applied and they often have the manager walking around with you and things cleaned up and marked off so you know where is safe to go. \n\nOp is asking his partner to stop working because he doesn\u2019t see her as a person any more. Just an incubator. And while he is likely to object to this accusation, I would ask he actually think about it for a minute. \n\nConstruction companies don\u2019t want lawsuits. When someone is pregnant until it becomes a safety concern (as in high risk pregnancy, far enough along their stamina is down, etc) they are perfectly safe on site. Once she can\u2019t make the site visits anymore both her office and the GC will have a solution in place and she will transition the site visits over. \n\nOP you stepped over the line. Your girlfriend is a professional and needs to do her job. And you need to trust she and her job will know when it\u2019s time for her to not be on site anymore. There are a lot of women who have had babies who are engineers and there will continue to be. They know what theyre doing.", "Why wasn't this an issue before she was pregnant?\n\nIt's because now she is pregnant with \"his child\"  he thinks he \"owns\" her and should be allowed to control her.", ">\"I don't see why this is so important.\"\n\nExactly. Doesn't matter if it's important or not to him, it's important to her.", "So he\u2019s a asshole for caring about his unborn baby and wife\u2019s safety? \ud83d\ude02Reddit man, ffs.", "Did you not read his post? OP is the Construction Site Manager for that project, he knows all of the site risks since he probably has to write up any accident reports for injuries, or at least sign off on the reports if someone else writes one up.", "I came here to say this. Also on construction sites. Or the ones I have been to, they mean business. They require everyone takes a safety refresher, they require you sign in, wear ppe as necessary, and they make sure you\u2019re not behaving like a hooligan. Literally the site manager walks around with you and if there are hazardous materials like spray insulation going up, they either ask you wear a respirator or they have you come another day when the site has had a chance to air out.", "Honestly the fact that he is a construction site manager makes this worse. Because he knows protocol. He knows how safety measures work on these sites. He knows how coordination works and how management teams don\u2019t allow the architects and engineers on site when hazardous materials are being applied. \n\nHe\u2019s ridiculous. This has nothing to do with her job and everything to do with his anxiety.", "There's lots of things people avoid while pregnant that are perfectly safe to others - rare steak, pate, runny eggs, paint fumes, alcohol, lifting suitcases, long car journeys, sleeping on your back at the end (im not even joking). Im preggers atm and im having to adjust to lots of changes cos my situation is different than it was 7 months ago, thats life.\n\n\nIn any industry where you do a risk assesment, the risk factor changes when the potential negative outcome is greater or more likely - pregnancy changes things\nOP is NTA for wanting to minimise unnecessary risks\n\n\nAlso He's  not holding her back in her career if she is not actually required on site, she just likes to go. Depending on the conditions of the site that could be foolhardy", "No joke. Fall in love with a motivated, career-focused woman. Get her pregnant. Now \"I don't understand why her job is important to her\". \"Why isnt her whole personality changing into Mother?\" \n\nIf he wanted a sit-at-a-desk, not-passionate-about-their-job partner, he should have had a baby with someone else.", "If he\u2019s concerned for her, why is this only an issue now that she\u2019s pregnant?", "She's definitely not the asshole for continuing her work in a safe manner.\n\n>It might help her make a decision.\n\nShe made her decision already. \n\nHim starting fights over something that is medically safe is going to do more harm than anything.", "No. I can assure you that these sites are kept to the highest standard of safety possible. And no one\u2019s doing dangerous shit when the engineers and architects are on site as most of the time they\u2019re halting to ask questions or something is being inspected to make sure it\u2019s following contract. \n\nThis is not a reasonable request. \n\nSigned : a woman in this field who has had other coworkers who have had babies do the same as OP\u2019s wife.\n\nNo one is stopping because they are pregnant (maybe later down the road when she doesn\u2019t have the stamina for it) but otherwise there are so many safety protocols and PPE that she is fine. \n\nOP is asking for her to sacrifice her career.", "lol, you're getting bent over for disagreeing with the majority. classic AITA.", ">I know there are a lot of Y T A votes \"her body\" etc., but for those who plan to keep their pregnancies, my personal thought is you start looking out for your child during pregnancy.\n\nAnd how isn't she taking care of herself and her baby? By working safely?\n\n>I want my child to be as healthy as possible.\n\nShe doesn't just because she's not hiding in a bubble? This is the condescending mom-shaming and fear-mongering that needs to stop. She's pregnant, she can work safely.", "I am sure you didn\u2019t mean \u201clet her\u201d", ">you're natural instinct is to protect your fiance and unborn baby.\n\n> **you're natural instinct is to protect your fiance**\n\nWhere was this instinct BEFORE she became pregnant? Or is it kickstarted when the stick turns blue? Pregnancy doesn't automatically make some fragile little flower that requires protection. She's planning on using PPE and taking precautions. Her bodily autonomy doesn't end because her partner has suddenly decided she now needs protecting.", "OP never worried about his gfs health on construction sites before and they were just as \u201chazardous\u201d but now that she\u2019s pregnant it\u2019s suddenly to dangerous. \n\nAs if she doesn\u2019t have the intellect to judge the risks and take appropriate precautions like wearing a mask or other appropriate PPE", "Yup, she is now The Incubator, but he doesn't even comprehend why his behavior has changed toward her.", "Why are you quoting \"owns\" when you're the one who's saying it?", "Wtf, there s product that are safe for people but teratogenic so toxic for the baby. Educate yourself", "bruh", "Yes poor little op, poor little victim. Thank god he has you to stand up for him.", "Well, he wasn\u2019t concerned with her safety before she got pregnant so you are factually incorrect, you little troll.", "He only started to care about her once she was turned into an incubator, no concern for her health before that", "No that's not what's being said. He can express the concern but in the end she has been doing this job before so why is the safety of it suddenly a concern now that she's pregnant? She kept herself safe before and he wasn't concerned about her being on site, so the only difference is that she's pregnant. \n\nOP said that she was already planning on taking the last few months of the pregnancy - which really is the bigger risk for slip and fall injuries because our centre of gravity shifts and balance can become an issue. \n\nIt's infantalising to keep insisting that now that she's pregnant he knows her body and how to keep herself safe better than she does.\n\nYou express the concern, have the conversation, and then you let it go. \n\nMy vote goes down for YTA.", "Was waiting for someone to point that out, trust me if there was a risk associated with being pregnant at a construction site you\u2019d know about it and they would not allow her to be there. They\u2019re not gonna risk that lawsuit lol", "If the construction site is dangerous to someone who's pregnant, it's dangerous to all the other workers as well. PPE doesn't become less effective if you're pregnant. Things aren't more likely to fall on you if you're pregnant.", "Clearly because she\u2019s pregnant.", "you're right, possibly a poor choice of words.  you probably think its chauvinistic, but its not intended that way.\n\nMy wife lets me do things, i let her do things.   we might not always like it, but like i said compromise is required.", "you are jumping to conclusions that he didn't feel protective before.  You are also reading a bit too much into my comment.\n\nAre you a parent yourself,?  judging by your response i'd go with a no.\n\nOnce my wife became pregnant (after years of trying and eventually IVF), i can assure you that your feelings of protection absolutely do increase in a good way and absolutely for everyone's sake.\n\nthen once our child was born the feeling that i'd do anything to protect my son was and still is unbelievable.  something only a parent can understand.", "Yep. I\u2019m an architect. They actively tell us the days that aren\u2019t safe due to hazardous conditions. OP is treating her as a vessel for his baby and not a person. And what\u2019s worse is he is asking her to stunt her career. When she is further along her job and the projects she\u2019s on will come up with a solution and it won\u2019t make her look nuts. Having her bow out now, when things are perfectly safe for her will make her look insane. Unless she is a very very high risk pregnancy there is no reason for her to alter her day to day.", "There would be a million signs if it was a big risk. They don\u2019t want to get sued.", "So he\u2019s not concerned for her. He\u2019s concerned for the kid.", "It's not jumping to conclusions when he never raised her safety with her until after she was pregnant.\n\n>Are you a parent yourself,? judging by your response i'd go with a no.\n\nAre you a woman? Judging by your response I'd go with no. You do appear to be another male who thinks being able to insert their genitals into someone else makes you an expert on them.", "Why is it not normal or wrong for him to be worried about his unborn child in this case? Doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that he\u2019s not concerned for his wife either.", "Thanks for confirming you aren't a parent.\n\nand again you jumped to conclusions by assuming he never raised safety with her before.  he said she's mainly office based and only occasionally goes to site.\n\ni'm not an expert on women, but i know how it feels to have a pregnant wife and precious child.", ">Once my wife became pregnant (after years of trying and eventually IVF), i can assure you that your feelings of protection absolutely do increase in a good way and absolutely for everyone's sake.\n\nThanks for confirming that you aren't a woman and that you only became concerned with your wife's well being once you successfully made her an incubator. Go you!!!"]}
