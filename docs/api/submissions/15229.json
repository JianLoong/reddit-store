If you guys are sharing cooking chores and you made something she hated, she asked you politely to alter or change it and you laughed in her face it would be rude. Same applies to her. Spices can be moderated easily. She should be accommodating, as should you when you cook. It\u2019s compromise and the basic tenet of living together. She\u2019s being the AH.", "NTA.  Maybe you should just cook your own food?  \n\nBut if it's this upsetting for her not to put you in pain maybe rethink the relationship.", "Haha you didn't phrase that well at all\ud83e\udd23\n\nBut NTA. I am not a fan of catering to picky eaters when cooking but even I will turn down the spice volume for wimpy husband. It's not reasonable to expect someone to eat food that either causes them physical pain or digestive problems.", "She\u2019s kinda correct though that that\u2019s not how Indian cooking works - typically the spices are added first or are the base of the dish so separately spicing two portions of the same dish wouldn\u2019t really work for most things. It\u2019s quite likely that her mother is actually fully cooking an extra dish for you each time, in which case you should really appreciate the effort she\u2019s going to cos that\u2019s really sweet of her. \n\nI kinda understand her pain. I\u2019m mixed race, part south Asian, and my wife is white and can\u2019t handle spice at all and sometimes I do roll my eyes or get annoyed at her because I love to cook and eat spicy food\u2026 and it\u2019s frustrating when I feel like I can\u2019t do that, or when I have to eat something that too me tastes bland and wrong because I couldn\u2019t use the spices I normally would. It\u2019s super annoying, and sometimes we will agree that she orders takeout and I can cook for myself what I want to eat. I end up cooking other types of foods that are easier to add spices to afterwards instead of cooking the food that is actually from my own culture/family.\n\nI think overall NTA, but you for real could have phrased the question better\u2026 \u2018why can\u2019t you be more like your mum\u2019 is just not a thing you should ever say to your partner. \ud83d\ude02", "Whew I was ready to say you're an AH. But your definitely not. The thing is it's completely wrong of your gf to cook spicy food knowing you don't handle it well.  Seems like she has the belief if she continues to force you to eat it you'll grow a tolerance. But even if that's true that's your decision to make not hers. \n\nI say just make your own food from now on......NTA", "NTA. You both should enjoy the meals. What is the point of sharing cooking responsibilities if you can't eat what is made.", "NTA- she needs to learn how to cook and compromise.   And yes if her mother knows how to make it less spicy, so could she by just asking.    And no, you dont need to learn how to like spicy foods, as thats your choice to or not.  I really dont think you two will last long if she has that attitude.", "INFO: do you cater to her tastes on your nights to cook?", "ESH \n\nSo you know, spices are generally added towards the beginning of cooking for the flavour to develop, so depending on the dish, it could mean basically cooking two separate meals. It does depend on the meal though- some would be easy to add spice to later on. I imagine her mother is choosing to only cook dishes that are easy to do at different spice levels, or is putting in a lot more work that she lets on.\n\nThat said, to the judgement, your girlfriend should be accomodating of you when cooking for the both of you. Just as you wouldn\u2019t cook her something that she doesn\u2019t like on your days to cook. Laughing at you was definitely uncalled for.\n\nAnd you shouldn\u2019t compare a woman to her mother. Ever. Just a terrible idea really. So you\u2019re a bit of an asshole for that.", "NTA\n\nI think you definitely have a right to eat food within your tolerance levels! \n\nHowever, your phrasing was not the best way to avoid conflict. No one likes being unfavorably compared, especially to their parents.", "ESH\n\nMostly for you not realizing the amount of effort put in by the mother to essentially segregate your dish from the rest of dishes and just assuming it was an easy reasonable thing to do all the time\n\nYou just decide to call your GF a liar without any knowledge of if you are correct or not.  There were a lot of ways to approach this when you didn\u2019t know.  You could have said what does your mom do to my food when she cooks a less spicy version?  Then you could have learned something.\n\nYou don\u2019t ask her to cook like your mother you ask her to be more like her mother.  Which likely Carrie\u2019s a whole lot of baggage.  Do her parents have traditional gender roles?\n\nThe GF is also the asshole if she is only cooking spicy food that is beyond your tolerance but it kind of sounds like she was already making it milder then her preference so their is a possibility she didn\u2019t know but with it being twice in a row I think it\u2019s probably enough to cross over to ESH.", "Okay. Ohhhkay.\n\nSo first: Never *ever* ask someone to be more like another person, especially a parent lol. That\u2019s never gonna end well.\n\nSecond: Your GF shouldn\u2019t have laughed at you. It\u2019s totally possible that after a lifetime of eating spicy food, she\u2019s got a high tolerance and what she made truly may have not tasted spicy to her. I can say that I have a very high spice tolerance, to the point where I jokingly call Tabasco, Frank\u2019s, and similar hot sauces \u201cfancy ketchup.\u201d So when I\u2019m cooking for my partner and I, I keep things \u201cnormal\u201d and adjust my portions to the level of heat I like.\n\nFinally: NTA (and I\u2019ve no knowledge of how to cook Indian food, I\u2019ve only ever ordered it) but do keep in mind that what her mom did was super sweet. But, adjusting your portion could have actually involved a *lot* more effort than you know. Many recipes require spices to simmer for the entirety of the cooking process. She may have made you a completely separate portion and not just pulled your serving early or something. So, it\u2019s totally possible that making that request of your GF is asking for her to do a lot more work on her cooking nights. Though, if that\u2019s the case, she should just say that so you guys can decide on a different meal plan.", "Yta. If she's supposed to be cooking only foods that you like on her nights, are you cooking her foods on your night? If you can't agree on food just cook for yourselves and maybe share the side dishes.", "I suggest you go live with her mother.", "Tact, thy name is not \"curryshenanigans415!\" \n\nThat noted, ESH except your gf's mother, who seems the epitome of gracious in catering to your undeveloped palate and gastrointestinal system. \n\nYour girlfriend could learn that sharing is caring, and you could learn that comparing her to her mother is the kiss of death.", "YTA but more of an idiot for that phrasing. Your GF might have been trying to do a milder version for you but didn\u2019t quite get there, hence the \u201cthis isn\u2019t even spicy\u201d comment. Ask her how the family would prepare the dish for a toddler. From what I understand from my Indian friends, little kids get milder versions and then they introduce the spicier, real recipes over time with yogurt.", "Ooof. A for intent. C- for delivery, and that is being kind about it.\n\nNext time, just stick to speaking on self. It isn\u2019t fair of her to ask you to change or \u201ctoughen up\u201d kind of thing, totally with you.\n\nNTA - but next time skip the mom comparison!", "Maybe she is being like her mom....I mean how often does her mom talk to you? Lololol", "ESH\n\nLMAO!!!\n\nYou had me on your side until you told us what you said! You should have just said \"Your mom makes my portion mild for me so I'm hoping that you can do the same\" or something like that. You blew it, dude, but not too bad. \n\nBut she's being mean and takes the biggest AH prize. If she refuses to adjust, then get your own dinner. See how that goes. If nothing changes, then maybe it's a bad idea to live together.", "ESH - how many times has her parents invited you to dinner? Is it same dish or different dishes?\n\nWhy are you living together after only 6 months? Did you not think about this beforehand?\n\nIt\u2019s not fair for you to eat food you can\u2019t handle, and it\u2019s not fair for her to never be able to eat food she enjoys either. You gotta come up with another compromise.", "Phrasing is factual and depending on the interpretation is could be insulting.  \\~ Learn to cook from her mom!\n\nNTA - You experienced Indian food you can eat due to her mom's accommodations. You simply asked if her cooking can reflect this too.  Her silent treatment instead of talking through what bothers her is not pleasant; its a form of control.  Best to you.", "ESH. She\u2019s in the wrong about her attitude towards cooking for another person, and you for the mother crack when making your point. If you\u2019ve agreed to cook for each other, that means cooking something that the other can eat. You\u2019ve communicated that spiciness is an issue, so that\u2019s a known constraint for shared food.\n\nI know it\u2019s factually true that her mother has shown it is possible to make milder Indian food. But the comparative phrasing is going to be hurtful even if factually true. She\u2019s clearly watched her mother do this, so it\u2019s not news to her. That she still refuses is a problem, but not one that will resolve by referencing her mother like this.", "YTA for how you phrased it.  Never, and I mean NEVER, tell your GF to be more like one of your mothers.  It will not end well.  \n\nBut N T A for the request to tone down the spice.  I too have a low tolerance.  There is a point where it isn\u2019t even a flavor anymore.  It\u2019s just pain.  And there\u2019s a genetic component to capsaicin receptors.

Should have asked her if she could consult with her mother about how her mother achieves it.\n\nGF is a bit of an A H for her comments about the spiciness.

People in the comments saying Indian cooking doesn\u2019t work that way are just ignorant. Indian cooking more than any other cuisine can easily be adjusted to cater to different spice levels. The spices we use except pepper corn and chilli\u2019s do not cause problems. Just add these two to your food post cooking or do a small tadka which takes a minute or two. I don\u2019t understand how the gf wont accommodate her bf\u2019s genuine issues (not whims) when cooking for BOTH of them. Her fondness of spicy food can easily be catered to with an extra two to three minutes. Poor guy cant eat spice at all!! Which is easier? \n\nI do feel the request should have been worded better and OP could have asked her to contact her mom on advice.

Literally.\n\nI adore Indian food. Probably my favourite of all foods. It is so varied, so different and so complex.\n\nHowever, even when I was young, I had a bit of a problem with food that was too hot. As I've aged, my intolerance has increased to the point where even the mildest dish can send me running for industrial quantities of kitchen roll. Ideally, I'd sit at the table with a towel on my head but it's not a good look... Anyway, I no longer eat Indian food, or any other chilli-heavy food (I'm looking at you Thai food) in public.\n\nOn the other hand, I have done my best to recreate decent Indian dishes at home, not always successfully, and the heat element is part of the dish. It's not something you can add at the end to vary the intensity, at least not in anything I've cooked, so asking your GF to make you something less hot is asking her to make two separate dishes every time she cooks\n\n*Asking* her to tone things down a little was perfectly understandable. *Telling* her that her mum does it so why can't she is tantamount to a declaration of hostilities.\n\nN T A for the request (I would have to do the same) but a very gentle \"What were you thinking?\" YTA for asking her to be more like her mum\n\nBy the way, OP, I've been married for a very long time and can assure you that your GF **will** become more like her mum.

My husband who is also white, loves spicy foods too and even he has trouble figuring out my tolerance level. When someone is used to eating that much spice, it can get difficult to tell what is actually spicy and what isn't because you build up that tolerance. I don't think she is doing it on purpose. I think she really thought she made it milder because her own taste buds didn't notice the spice. They just need to come up with a better compromise or he needs to apologize and try to find out from her mom what she does differently that helped mitigate the spice.", ">Mostly for you not realizing the amount of effort put in by the mother to essentially segregate your dish from the rest of dishes and just assuming it was an easy reasonable thing to do all the time\n\n100% agreed.

Except really don't compare someone to their parents unless doing so favorably, and even then only with extreme caution.  \n\nYour partner's mother is likely going out of her way to make you a mild version of the dish.  That's nice of her, but your girlfriend is also right in that building the spice and flavor in a dish doesn't really work right if you are just adding additional spice to half at the end.  So you are essentially asking her to make two different meals on her nights, if she ever wants to eat the food at the spice level she prefers.  \n\nIn an ideal world we'd all like all the food, right?  But that isn't how life works most of the time, so you have to make compromises to come to an arrangement that makes both people comfortable and happy.

Also, her GF should be a little bit more considerate in cooking food which he can eat too. \n\nIf I think of dinner versions in India then it's probably Roti and some version of curry or rice and dal and some veggies. You can most certainly make less spicy dal by adding tadka separately. Rice and roti aren't exactly spicy. That leaves curry and veggies.
