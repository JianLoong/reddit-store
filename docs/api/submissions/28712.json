Sounds like you are pulling your weight around the place. \n\nMaybe try having a better conversation with her where you start out nicer and get snippier as it goes on. That way you can hear her side (yes you should listen to her) and she can here yours and hopefully come out with something you both can live with.", "NTA\n\nShe disrespected you by treating you like a child in your own home. Then she got upset when you fired back.\n\nTell your roommate that his gf needs to stop touching your stuff and treating you like a child.", "NTA, but get ready for lease renewal time because either you should move out or they will move out. Don\u2019t be blindsided.", "I\u2019m gunna say NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to listen to someone who doesn\u2019t pay or technically live there, and she shouldn\u2019t be touching your stuff. If it was left out, she can just let you know to move it so things are tidier. However her putting away dishes at 6am I wouldn\u2019t say is an issue? At least she\u2019s helping with chores instead of JUST being a freeloader.", "NTA\n\nBut it annoys me when dishes are in the sink, of course this is not my flat.  Do you leave trash or clothes laying around in the common areas?  Do you have your things just everywhere?  \n\nI get she has no right at all to wake you up, but is she trying to be helpful?", "NTA - She doesn't get to tell you how to clean a space she's living in for free, nor does she get to touch your stuff / reorganise your stuff", "NTA. Someone that doesn't pay rent doesn't get a say in how the household is ran and organized. If she has a problem with it, she can go back to her own home where she is in control.", "NTA", "So your friend's GF is trying to parent you? They need their own place if they want to play house.

She\u2019s not paying rent, and she\u2019s moving your stuff to store her stuff without talking to you, which is a serious invasion of privacy and disrespectful of your stuff. I\u2019d definitely talk this out with your roommate, maybe ask for an agreement that neither of your things should get reorganized without permission.", "I may be different that everybody else, but I think YTA, because it seems, from the info you gave in your post, that you are not putting an effort to do the chores and keep the place organizated; your roommate\u00b4s GF has done the dishes or organize things you didnt do properly, trying to give you friendly feedback to help you as you are even leaving the dishes in the sink for like a day.\n\nIt is true that your roommate should have told you if there was a problem, but maybe sit down with him and have a proper chat.", "YTA Unless it was explicitly stated when you moved in that your habits and preferences would take precedence over someone who clearly already had authority on how the household was run, it's pretty shitty of you to treat her like she no longer has a say simply because you pay rent. \n\nShe should be treated like a roommate if that was the dynamic when you moved in. At the very least, she should have been treated with respect and not dismissed out of hand as if she is beneath you. \n\nYou need to sit down with your roommate and agree on what everyone's expectations are as far as cleaning and who gets a say in things. Your assumption that she doesn't isn't more right than her assumption that she will conti to have as much of a say as she's always had.", "INFO: Do you pay rent", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

BUT she is practically a roommate \u2014 your friend is on the lease, and he\u2019s dating her. She helps with chores, albeit at times that don\u2019t agree with your sleep schedule. (Silicon earplugs are great BTW.) There are other ways to contribute to a living situation besides paying rent, and I feel you\u2019re focused on that part because she\u2019s pissing you off. I\u2019d be pissed too. Even if she was paying ALL the rent, she shouldn\u2019t touch your things.\n\nI think the three of you need to have a house meeting. She may not be on the lease, but until/unless they break up, she\u2019s gonna be in your space.", "NTA...about listening to roommates gf. BUT learn to clean up after yourself. Wipe your ass, flush toilets, clean up after you cook and put your shit away. This is what adults do.", "She just changed the subject from the fact that she was moving your stuff. How about we address that first, and go from there.", "are you missing the part where she touches his things without permission? it sounds like she doesn't see him as a roommate or someone on their level but instead a guest in her and her boyfriend's place. she doesn't have any say in where his stuff goes paying or not.", "There are also (free) apps you can download (because noise machines can get pricy)."]}
