You're not a couple, you don't combine income here", "NTA. It\u2019s suspicious that he is pressuring you like this and that he freaked out when you asked to see the receipt.

If you can\u2019t see the receipt and your bill is not what you expect something shady is going on.", "Not directly but he is paying with food stamps and expects me to give him the exact cash equivalent", "Trust me I\u2019m considering it, this is far from the only abnormal thing he does. the rent here is just so affordable compared to the rest of California, that\u2019s the only reason I stay. I\u2019ve already paid First/Last month so. Been here about 6 months, so to get my moneys worth I\u2019d have to stay at least another month. And I\u2019m probably paying this month here on the first as well.", "Edit: I'm not judging people who sell food stamps. I get that sometimes you need the cash more urgently to buy toilet paper, pay the power bill, etc. But using that argument might shut him up.", "Honestly after all these comments I am going to start looking, because like I said, this is just one of MANY weird things he does.", "He\u2019s still taking advantage because he spends more thank you want and likely eats more than his share and since he buys in bulk he spends more at one time.  I\u2019d ignore his commentary and explain this is how you budget and prefer to keep it separate and remind him again when it\u2019s brought up. good luck he sounds like a real challenge", "Look you can do your shopping whoever you want to. But complaining he expects to be paid back is just insane. Of course he'd want to be paid back.", "I am not complaining about paying him back and still did in this instance, but he grabbed multiples of items, the bill came out to twice what I expected, it seemed like he was just trying to dump food stamps on me.\n\nEdit: I see what you are saying though.", "Info: do you mean like, you put deodorant on the list & he  buys you a multi pack from Sam's club?", "Sam's sells things in multi packs though.", "NTA  he was just selling you his food stamps, you are right!", "> I\u2019m an idiot for doing this,\n\nMove out.

And single people don't generally get to buy in bulk anyway, so you don't really need much from Sam's Club.", "Who cares what his motive is. We know that it benefits him and not you. Use instacart instead. Don't feel bad for him because he is disabled. Disabled people are perfectly capable of being dicks too.", "NTA he sounds insufferable. He may be your roommate and also landlord but that doesn't mean your groceries are any of his business.", "NTA if he\u2019s selling food stamps make sure it\u2019s 50/50, that\u2019s the going rate ($50 cash for $100 stamps)", "NTA - he was taking advantage of you and now he's stuck with his own costs.", "He isn\u2019t literally selling me the food stamps, I\u2019m saying indirectly he wants me to let him buy groceries so I give him cash equivalent while he is using food stamps to purchase everything.", "Honestly he is hardly disabled, he says he is legally blind. But he can see with glasses and drive (with restrictions) so it can\u2019t be that bad. That\u2019s why they are giving him such a hard time getting disability and he has been fighting for two years with a lawyer for it.", "Right? Among other things he is super racist, constantly goes on and on about shocking things I will not repeat here. The only benefit I get from this really is rides to the train station for work (it\u2019s about 5 min away). But he is in general super distasteful.", "Going rate for food stamps in my area is 50% ($200 in stamps is $100 cash), maybe 75% if you like the person. So in that sense, he's 100% using you. I won't get into the criminal part, but yes, buying/selling is technically a crime. \n\nAlso, as the other guy pointed out, is he adding stuff that he wants/eats? If so, he's definitely using you to pay for his own food and turn it into cash.\n\nMy thought is, is he an addict/have any vices (smoking, drinking, etc)? All of those are non-EBT, so he'd want the cash, and overcharging you means he gets more money for that. \n\nEchoing the other people's sentiments, I'd look to move. If he's being shady about this, as your landlord, I'd expect further shadyness to occur and be worse.", "He\u2019s stupid.", "I'd ask yourself did he want a lodger or a human pet? Some suspiciously low rents are low for a reason - aiming to shortcut on people's decision-making process or get someone who can't afford to say no.", "Keep looking around- just in case you find something", "Leave soon."]}
