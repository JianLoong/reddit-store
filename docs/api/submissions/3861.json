If you\u2019re buying the gifts, they need to have your name on them. If you don\u2019t want to fund gifts for her, your choice. You\u2019re teaching her right! Next year, maybe she\u2019ll earn money to spend at Christmas.", "NTA, if she doesn't know what it means to budget and have to compromise, then this is the perfect opportunity. As for buying presents for HER boyfriend and HIS family, that's not your problem. If that's what she wants to do then she can spend her own money on it. 15 should be responsible enough for a babysitter job, and she should have been doing chores around the house for an allowance for at minimum the last 3 years.", "N T A. tell her there is new thing out there called \"work\". Cool concept, you perform a service or sell goods and you get compensation for it. Don't say it like I did though lol.", "NTA - at first I was thinking why can't she get them a few small gifts? But then with your reasoning I think it's perfectly understandable that you can't afford it. You should probably try to split the budget and get something at least for the grandkids and spend less on your 15 year old though. Maybe suggest she takes the family a box of chocolates to share - you can get big ones pretty cheap and she'll not be embarrassed by not giving them anything.", "Nta. You can\u2019t do it for good reason not because you\u2019re being malicious or because you just don\u2019t want too.", "NTA, time to show her the books", "NTA and honestly I would maybe get her one gift (if that) and sit her down and explain how finances and budgeting work. That\u2019s the problem with young kids and teens, they have no clue about what things cost and budgeting/saving for what you want vs need. My parents struggled while I was growing up and they always explained to us why we couldn\u2019t have certain things and when I was old enough to work they made me pay for name brand items, gas, tickets to the movies, etc. Your daughter sounds a little spoiled and you shouldn\u2019t be paying for gifts for her bf and family when you\u2019re barely getting by and your own grandchildren aren\u2019t getting anything :(", "NTA you can\u2019t afford it why don\u2019t you suggest a job or to start for her to start babysitting on weekends for neighbors kids or whatever.", "NTA \n\nIt is understandable that you are not able to fund your daughter's desire to buy gifts for her boyfriend and his family, given your financial situation. It is not unreasonable for you to prioritize your own children and grandchildren over your daughter's boyfriend and his family, especially if you are already struggling to make ends meet. While it may be disappointing for your daughter, it is ultimately your decision as a parent to decide how to allocate your financial resources. You are not necessarily the asshole in this situation, but it may be helpful to have a conversation with your daughter about your financial situation and why you are unable to fund her gift-giving plans.", "NTA. These things happen. If you can\u2019t afford it, you can\u2019t afford it. At 15 she is old enough to understand it (if not mature enough to accept it). In the end, she is 15 years old - the entire world is unfair to her if it doesn\u2019t give her exactly what she wants.", "I'm a bit baffled by this post. Why is your 15 y/o the only one of your children getting presents? She shouldn't get more just because she complains the most.\n\nBut, if there's X amount of money available for gift buying, you haven't already spent it, and your daughter would rather spend it on gifts for her boyfriend, I think that's probably her call to make.\n\nThink I'd need more info to make a judgement.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your responsibility to buy gifts for her boyfriend and his family. \n\nBut why the hell are you allowing her boyfriend to partially live at your house?  Your daughter's a kid.", "NTA I will say this, if your 15 yo is getting gifts and she wants to have some of the money you would spend on gifts to get him and his family gifts, why not? You will be giving her what she wants for Christmas. I hate to see anyone stressing like this over a holiday.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't hide the fact that money is tight from her. She needs to understand that if she wants to buy gifts, she is going to have to either a) get a part time job to pay for them herself or b) craft something with materials you have on hand. Is she going to be upset? Yes, she's 15! Teenagers are all knowing, didn't you know?! Will she appreciate that you were real with her? That depends on your relationship with her.", "NTA - she is 15, she is old enough to understand financial difficulties and if she doesn't, she's old enough to learn. Sit her down, explain it to her. Tell her no one, including her, is getting anything and hopefully next year will be better. Stick to not buying for anyone, if you slip, you will be TA.", "NTA. Maybe she can make them something?", "NTA, I imagine in this case, the 15 year olds justification is that they have reduced the amount they asked for on their list, so therefore, they should be entitled to the money saved.  However, this is a flawed argument as the money saved is not theirs to start with. The fifteen year old should have saved some money themselves for the gifts or got a job to afford them.  No one is entitled to their parents money  or the right to spend it on other people. The OP is working her butt off to keep her head above the water, that has to be good enough.", "It\u2019s called am I the asshole.

You are doing your daughter dirty if you let her do this. \n\nIn all likelihood this boy is gone daddy gone in a year or two.", "NTA. She's 15, let her figure it out.", "NTA My kid went through this at 14/15 with a boyfriend.  We are upper middle class.  Money is not an issue, but we absolutely would not give her money for her boyfriend/friend gifts. She needed to figure out how to earn it.  Babysitting and finding odd jobs.  I grew up in a poor household, and my mother def over compensated because of guilt . She put herself in debt and spent money in wrong places to try to hide our poverty.  You shouldn't do that.   Your daughter needs to understand how hard money can be to come by. She can make things for her boyfriend's family.  There is no way his parents will care about receiving a gift from her.  Now is the time to talk to your daughter about priorities and what is important. Will she be pissed and act like she can't hear you, yup.  But the information will be there for her to grow into.  She isn't even going to know this guy in the next 5 years.  My kid is 19, and has nothing to do with that first boyfriend she was with for 2 years.   His parents gave him money to buy her a Tiffany necklace!!! My husband and I were disgusted.  Embrace the values you want to pass on and don't make decisions from guilt about your situation.", "Yes. 100% this. They know she isn't working. How is it a thoughtful gift from her if her only sacrifice is the shopping? The daughter needs to get real. If she wants to buy a gift with cash she best be doing some babysitting or other things to make a bit of cash.", "That is so rude. Why be a dick about stuff. Some parents do not communicate properly financial information.  \n\n\"We don't have money for many presents this year. The bills are high, and my bonus is not what it normally is.\" \n\nYou do realize that parents give their kids money sometimes right? If they have the finances to do so. Some even when they do not. \n\nThough you could be a time traveler from the 1600's where like 5 year olds had jobs like chimney sweeps. \nOr as you might call them, the good ol days.", "A lot of people spend more on dependent children for gifts than independent adult children. As a dependent child I got 3 good bikes (I outgrew 2, got the last as a teen) but wouldn't expect my parents to buy me a good bike for hundreds of dollars now I'm an adult. I could hardly buy my own bikes at 5, 9 and 13. I don't get any gifts costing hundreds of dollars now but as a kid bikes, a game system, a trampoline and other expensive items weren't yearly but weren't unknown.\n\nOP has spent their gift money (more than, they're paying it in instalments) and there's nothing to suggest their daughter wants less spent on her in exchange for money for her to buy gifts. Most adults don't expect much from 15 year olds in the way of gifts, maybe homemade cookies or a nice handmade card, I'm sure OP can find $20 for materials if the daughter will put in effort besides demanding money. But it doesn't surprise me that a dependent teen gets a more expensive gift than the grown children.", "Did you see where she is already financially stressed and putting her daughters presents on credit? Where she can\u2019t afford presents for her other children or her own grandchildren?", "Reading is fundamental.  I clearly said not to say it the way I did. She needs to get a job. After school, summertime etc. That talk probably hasn't been had yet."]}
