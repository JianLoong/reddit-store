As for buying presents for HER boyfriend and HIS family, that's not your problem. If that's what she wants to do then she can spend her own money on it. 15 should be responsible enough for a babysitter job, and she should have been doing chores around the house for an allowance for at minimum the last 3 years.", "N T A. tell her there is new thing out there called \"work\".

That\u2019s the problem with young kids and teens, they have no clue about what things cost and budgeting/saving for what you want vs need. My parents struggled while I was growing up and they always explained to us why we couldn\u2019t have certain things and when I was old enough to work they made me pay for name brand items, gas, tickets to the movies, etc. Your daughter sounds a little spoiled and you shouldn\u2019t be paying for gifts for her bf and family when you\u2019re barely getting by and your own grandchildren aren\u2019t getting anything :(", "NTA you can\u2019t afford it why don\u2019t you suggest a job or to start for her to start babysitting on weekends for neighbors kids or whatever.", "NTA \n\nIt is understandable that you are not able to fund your daughter's desire to buy gifts for her boyfriend and his family, given your financial situation. It is not unreasonable for you to prioritize your own children and grandchildren over your daughter's boyfriend and his family, especially if you are already struggling to make ends meet. While it may be disappointing for your daughter, it is ultimately your decision as a parent to decide how to allocate your financial resources. You are not necessarily the asshole in this situation, but it may be helpful to have a conversation with your daughter about your financial situation and why you are unable to fund her gift-giving plans.", "NTA. These things happen. If you can\u2019t afford it, you can\u2019t afford it. At 15 she is old enough to understand it (if not mature enough to accept it).

Why is your 15 y/o the only one of your children getting presents? She shouldn't get more just because she complains the most.\n\nBut, if there's X amount of money available for gift buying, you haven't already spent it, and your daughter would rather spend it on gifts for her boyfriend, I think that's probably her call to make.\n\nThink I'd need more info to make a judgement.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your responsibility to buy gifts for her boyfriend and his family. \n\nBut why the hell are you allowing her boyfriend to partially live at your house?

You will be giving her what she wants for Christmas. I hate to see anyone stressing like this over a holiday.I am editing this because someone nicely brought it to my attention, I may have sounded like OP should BUY gifts. I am saying if daughter wants $ for Christmas, let her spend it as she wishes. I do NOT think OP should be stressed about gifts. She is stating the BF\u2019s parents are buying her a bunch of things.

She's 15, let her figure it out.", "NTA My kid went through this at 14/15 with a boyfriend.  We are upper middle class.  Money is not an issue, but we absolutely would not give her money for her boyfriend/friend gifts. She needed to figure out how to earn it.  Babysitting and finding odd jobs.  I grew up in a poor household, and my mother def over compensated because of guilt . She put herself in debt and spent money in wrong places to try to hide our poverty.  You shouldn't do that.   Your daughter needs to understand how hard money can be to come by. She can make things for her boyfriend's family.  There is no way his parents will care about receiving a gift from her.  Now is the time to talk to your daughter about priorities and what is important. Will she be pissed and act like she can't hear you, yup.  But the information will be there for her to grow into.  She isn't even going to know this guy in the next 5 years.  My kid is 19, and has nothing to do with that first boyfriend she was with for 2 years.

The bills are high, and my bonus is not what it normally is.\" \n\nYou do realize that parents give their kids money sometimes right? If they have the finances to do so.

Most adults don't expect much from 15 year olds in the way of gifts, maybe homemade cookies or a nice handmade card, I'm sure OP can find $20 for materials if the daughter will put in effort besides demanding money.

If she is an adult getting his family gifts, then it's something she needs to put her money to.\n\nOf course she's acting like an asshole, she's a 15 year old who has unrealistic demands and isn't getting what she wants.
