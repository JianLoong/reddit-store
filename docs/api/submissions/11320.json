How many dog owners make the mistake of letting their kids climb all over their dogs and then the child ends up in the ER. This can happen with any dog, it is more of a concern with larger dogs because their bites are likely to do more damage. The right thing to do here is to hire a professional trainer who will work with you at home and teach you to recognize your dogs stress cues as well as learning to teach your child how to be around your dog so that your dog never feels threatened or stressed. Even the most docile dog can bite and it\u2019s not because there\u2019s something wrong with the dog , it\u2019s because humans don\u2019t learn to recognize dogs body language and behaviors.

Best scenario is still a two-parent household.", "If you love a dog, it's clear that they're capable of loving you as much and in the exact same way, and he's known the dog longer than he's known the kid. The dog should clearly come first. Besides, the dog will die in a few years and then OP can build a relationship with his child.", "I completely agree with this.", "You should have constant supervision when small children are around any breed of dog, though? That's just being safe.", "most pittbulls are babies who love everyone and aren't harmful at all, your attitude is gross.", "Accidents can happen with any dog, though.", "So. You don\u2019t have experience raising pits. So your statement should\u2019ve read something like \u201cmy Belgian Malinois was aggressive and you should be an aware and present parent with ANY type of dog breed\u201d.

I actually foster dogs through a dog rescue. This rescue is the last one through the shelters - the dogs they do not take are put down.  Shelters are full almost everywhere, and Pitties are much harder to place.  As someone who has fostered many homeless dogs that would have otherwise killed, yeah, I think that I can speak on behalf of those dogs. When you take a dog in, you're committing to take care of them for the rest of their lives, not until it becomes inconvenient.  Depending on what OP did with that dog, it would not have a high probability of making it out of the shelter alive.", "Not if the 2 parents in the household don\u2019t get along.

You are completely right with what you said about being present", "I'd absolutely go to court to keep my kids away from an animal who I felt was dangerous. But before I'd do that I would speak to the other parent about safety precautions concerning my child and the dog. From the post it's the first time she's brought up safety concerns and it was only after dog hair concerns. That doesn't seem like the behavior of someone who is afraid for their child's physical safety.", "He does not say that.

She's choosing her child's safety.", "It is true that some breeds are more aggressive but not the ones that you think. The most aggressive dog breeds are dachshunds and chihuahuas. Pit bulls aren\u2019t even close to being in the top 10 of aggressive breeds.", "I understand that wasn\u2019t your intention. But the shame that pit bulls get is the reason there are so many untrained dogs and uninformed owners. Your comment should\u2019ve included all dog breeds, as any dog can attack a child at anytime.
