How many dog owners make the mistake of letting their kids climb all over their dogs and then the child ends up in the ER. This can happen with any dog, it is more of a concern with larger dogs because their bites are likely to do more damage. The right thing to do here is to hire a professional trainer who will work with you at home and teach you to recognize your dogs stress cues as well as learning to teach your child how to be around your dog so that your dog never feels threatened or stressed.
