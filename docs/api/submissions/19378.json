I saw some people saying you should\u2019ve spoken to the man himself instead of his caregiver, and I agree that in general the person themselves should be addressed, but in this case I think it was appropriate to ask the caregiver. If you were at a bar and a strange man was touching you, you wouldn\u2019t ask him to stop, you would probably mention it to a bartender or security guard and ask them to speak to the man about it, so I think this is a similar situation.

Like, I think he only had 2 incidents in the 2.5 years I was there. And when you started at the office, they let you know what not to do around John. So most of the time he was SUPER sweet and wanted to be very affectionate. Whenever he came into the office, he wanted to run around and give all the women in the office big, very sloppy kisses on the cheek.

She could have done nearly the same thing to the man.  \n\"Please stop touching me.\"", "Did she throw the vase at YOU?  I understand getting frustrated.  I grew out of it.", "If someone is disabled to that degree, their caretaker is fully responsible for making sure they don't harass other people. Even if the disabled person can't be held responsible, their caretaker becomes fully responsible, and popping an attitude and accusing the other person of being rude is entirely unacceptable.", "You forgot that, the man/old man was touching himself and than touching her. The OP, herself an autism, with the fear of being touch/don\u2019t like being touches by strangers. So it\u2019s dangerous \nNTA", "If the man is so disabled he needs someone to help him use the bathroom. It's very possible he was trying to get her attention for assistance.\n\nOp treated this man like an animal. \n\nNobody wants a random stranger to touch them, that's a given, but some of you people are just insane.", "How is: \"can you please not let him touch me? It bothers me.\" \nSo much more compassionate than: \"please don't let him touch me.\"? Both are a polite way to assert a boundary that shouldn't even need to be stated to a stranger in public.", "I'm sorry, if I see an adult disabled enough to need a carer, touching his penis, in line to a small cramped room I need to access to pee I am 100% going to take every precaution to protect myself. Someone with a child's mind in an adult body can be dangerous without being malicious. I'm not going to risk it. \n\nI used to work at a mall GameStop and I've been assaulted by people who didn't know better and I couldn't ban because they were disabled. Even though they may or may not understand consent or the full meaning of their actions, I still had my shirt forcibly ripped open by a young man who looked to be in his early 20s because \"he wanted to see what clothes my clothes were made of\" during one of his group home's field trips. \n\nI don't care about your feelings when my safety is in question. I don't know your story, and you don't know if he's going to touch someone who will mace him.", ">She's describing the behavior of a developmentally disabled adult in distress, not a predator. My 45 yo cousin would behave the exact same way\n\nOne does not preclude the other. And your aunt and uncle should have taught him appropriate behavior or he needs to have someone with him who keeps him from harassing strangers.", "There\u2019s a difference between a child and an adult", "I do agree with your comment, but you do realize that the OP Also has a developmental disorder.", "If neither can consent then it gets very legally murky. Highly likely in this case it is NOT rape because rape requires mens rea and a mentally incapacitated person does not have it by default.", "Yes, but there are degrees of rape. It is important to remember that. It's all wrong and should be dealt with very harshly, but some rape is worse than other's. Plus, an environment of one person who doesn't know any better wandering into the room of another person who doesn't know any better and a rape occurring is a very different environment to violent people tackling random people and forcing themselves on each other in the hallways. It's fair to want to clarify between the two.", "People are claiming OP is infantalizing the man by addressing his carer and not him, but also saying (essentially) \"him grabbing his genitals is harmless and you're ableist for thinking he's as dangerous as any other man who grabs himself and then touches you!\" Pick a lane, babes. Either OP is a big, bad meanie for not directly telling a man she's intimidated by to stop grabbing her (she's not) or she's ableist for treating him like any other man (she's not).\n\nWomen can't win. NTA and shame on anyone who is denying OP her humanity by shaming her for speaking up in the way she felt safe to do so or shaming her for treating this man like any other that made her uncomfortable.", "How is \"asking the guy himself to stop touching you rather than asking the person you assume to be their carer to not allow him to touch you\" excusing his behavior?", "I mean the way OP is describing it, it sounds like the \"pee pee dance\" that kids do when they really have to do - not a sexual thing.", "These responses are wild. The onus is on the caretaker in this case. The caretakers should have been paying better attention to what was going on and stopped their client/patient from touching strangers. The person doing the touching shouldn\u2019t have been in a position to do so in the sense that the caretaker should have moved him or redirected him. I understand the concern - I have also worked with clients with developmental disabilities who are (not saying it\u2019s necessarily the case here) sexually preoccupied. They have all had dedicated staff making sure they don\u2019t hurt others or hurt themselves. The caretaker was way out of line, and honestly she\u2019s the one fostering any potential danger by not doing her job.", "I\u2019m confused - where did I say anything that would suggest otherwise?\n\nI didn\u2019t say the carer was right to respond that way, or that OP was wrong to react that way. In fact I said explicitly that OP was not wrong and that the carer should have prevented it in the first place or redirected them immediately.", "And how on earth is she supposed to be know that? All she knows is he keeps touching himself and then touching her. Nobody is treating anyone like an animal, she responded to a situation that made her very uncomfortable by taking the safest approach for her own personal safety. It\u2019s ridiculous to think that\u2019s problematic. She literally has no clue how he may have responded, but guess who would? Guess who would know how to handle the situation and calm things down if they happened to escalate? Oh that\u2019s right, the caretaker would because that\u2019s literally their damn job", "Exactly. The priority when you\u2019re dealing with a man touching his genitals and touching you is to get him to stop touching you, not debate if you\u2019re hurting his feelings. His caretaker should\u2019ve already stopped him the second he touched op to begin with! Yes there\u2019s extenuating circumstances, which is why I\u2019m not saying to pepper spray him, but worrying about phrasing is not the priority or should even be involved here.", ">I still had my shirt forcibly ripped open by a young man who looked to be in his early 20s because \"he wanted to see what clothes my clothes were made of\" during one of his group home's field trips. \n\nWTF?! What happened after?", "People need to have more compassion for the mentally disabled, good god. I used to be a caregiver for the mentally challenged. They are paid way too low, are responsible for people\u2019s lives, and have to know every one of the clients possible triggers, handicaps, everything. \n\nSimply assuming they\u2019re violent just because of how they look and act? \n\nDo you do this with others? Asian, African American, Irish, Scottish? Or is it just reserved for the mentally challenged?", "I work with developmentally disabled people. You can't always just teach them appropriate behavior. My guy does the same thing where he grabs himself like that when he has to pee. I tell him literally every single time it's not appropriate to do that. I've been telling him for 10 years. He still does it every single time. \n\nHis apartment door slams shut because it's a fire safe door. I tell him almost every single time to not let the door slam. I've been doing that for 10 years. If I don't remind him he let's the door slam. \n\nDepending on their level of function, they can be fine in the community (which my dude is!) in basically every standard scenario. But there are certain things you can't \"teach\", it's what they do, they're gonna do it, and it doesn't matter how much you redirect, cue, or explain.", "Are you joking? Have you spent any time around the mentally handicapped? As someone who worked in the field while working my way through college, you\u2019re missing the mark by a long shot if you think his parents could teach away his disability. \ud83d\ude44", "Sooo it\u2019s impossible for people with downs to ever hurt someone?", "Add to that the fact that OP is autistic and specifically stated she doesn't like to be touched like that by strangers, so shaming her for feeling deeply uncomfortable and/or unsafe is like saying his disability is more \"relevant\" than hers... They might need different levels of support, but there's something I've learnt as an autistic woman myself while interacting with autistic men: disability is not an excuse to let people waltz over your boundaries. It doesn't matter if they fully understand it or not; we're completely in our rights to remove ourselves from unwanted situations. **Their** rights do not trump **our** rights. NTA", "We see this so often: \u201cWe can\u2019t blame him for grabbing his genitals and touching you, but we can blame you for not INSTANTLY, in the moment, knowing the EXACT RIGHT WAY to ask him to please stop doing that.\u201d", "It doesn't matter why he did it, it's inappropriate period.", "I don't think it really matters tbh. The fact still remains, a strange man touched his genitals then touched her. It's inappropriate and she owes nothing to someone doing something like that", "Sounded like you were apologizing for the disabled person in the first half of the second paragraph. That was my bad for not reading the rest of your comment.", "*Simply assuming they\u2019re violent just because of how they look and act?*\n\nActions are a perfectly valid way of judging if someone is violent. This dude wasn't minding his business, and she just assumed he was violent. He was touching his genitals and her repeatedly in a fairly enclosed space. That's a valid reason to be concerned for one's safety.\n\nI say this as a disabled and chronically ill woman. Have I dealt with ableism? Absolutely. But this isn't it.", "Oh for the love of god, get real. \n\nI work with disabled populations. And QUITE OFTEN, adult individuals who have carers in public spaces, especially if they have significant social disinhibition like touching themselves and touching others, are NOT UNLIKELY to have violent tendencies. \n\nI have encountered wounds and pulled hair and worse in people who attempted to ask someone with complex needs or a disability not to engage in a preferred activity. \n\nAlso, this man was clearly already in a state of impatience and discomfort. AND his carers were doing absolutely nothing to intervene when the behaviour occurred in the first place. That\u2019s literally their job. I understand they\u2019ve probably got a lot to keep an eye on. But then in that case, alerting them to a situation they missed should not be considered an insult.\n\nNo, OP should not fucking assume this man with a disability in need of care is violent. But they\u2019re not an asshole for assessing the possibility.  Often the best course of action would be to take some space if you\u2019re not comfortable addressing someone, but she\u2019s in line and has to pee.\n\nAnd\u2026 disability or not\u2026 \u201cpee dance\u201d or not\u2026he\u2019s a man touching his genital area and then touching her. Repeatedly. \n\nIf this was any other man, I would not be politely asking them to stop. Frankly asking the carer to step in WAS compassionate and taking into account his disability. If he was just a neurotypical white OR black OR Asian OR Scottish man, I\u2019d be leaving, telling him to fuck off, calling the police\u2026.\n\nI get the connection you\u2019re trying to make, discrimination is discrimination, blah blah blah. \n\nBut we are talking about behaviour. Disabilities literally do directly affect people\u2019s core behaviours. As opposed to race or ethnicity or regionality. OP was in an unfamiliar, uncomfortable situation and was being touched repeatedly without their consent. \n\nThis is not comparable to a race issue.", "you seem to be unaware that neurological development is **not** the same as someone\u2019s ethnicity. please don\u2019t compare the two.", "Honestly, if they're disabled enough that they can't learn to not touch people, they shouldn't be going out in public. Or they should be carefully and meticulously supervised if they must go out in public. Being disabled doesn't give you freedom to be up in other people's business without their consent. At that point it's on the caretaker to make sure they aren't doing that shit.", ">Have you spent any time around the mentally handicapped?\n\nSince I have a developmental disability, yes I have. \n\n>if you think his parents could teach away his disability\n\nHence the, or he needs someone with him. Btw harassing others is not part of a disability.", "I think it matters a bit, because a lot of people here are assuming it was sexual.\n\n\nIt doesn't matter a whole lot, though.", "That definitely wasn\u2019t my intention. It\u2019s perfectly fine to have a problem with someone touching you without consent and I also understand that many people have no experience with significant disabilities so would read this situation very differently to how it appears to me. OP is not in the wrong. I was just trying to add some context since in the comments it\u2019s morphed from \u201cdisabled man touches OP\u2019s arm\u201d to \u201cman grabs OP from behind\u201d \n\nThe carer absolutely should not have had a go at OP either. From the post, if I had to guess, I\u2019d suggest that the carers are absolutely overwhelmed without sufficient ratios to take their clients out into the community but having to do it anyway - taking people with needs like this out is hugely challenging, especially without 1:1 support, and I imagine they encounter a lot of unpleasantness while doing their jobs.

Addressing the caretaker is like a lower severity version of calling the police or shouting for help.
