I saw some people saying you should\u2019ve spoken to the man himself instead of his caregiver, and I agree that in general the person themselves should be addressed, but in this case I think it was appropriate to ask the caregiver. If you were at a bar and a strange man was touching you, you wouldn\u2019t ask him to stop, you would probably mention it to a bartender or security guard and ask them to speak to the man about it, so I think this is a similar situation.

Like, I think he only had 2 incidents in the 2.5 years I was there. And when you started at the office, they let you know what not to do around John. So most of the time he was SUPER sweet and wanted to be very affectionate. Whenever he came into the office, he wanted to run around and give all the women in the office big, very sloppy kisses on the cheek. I do not like having a big smear of anyone's spit all over my cheek, so when he would come running at me, I'd say \"Hi John! No kisses!\" in a friendly manner and he'd stop himself and just give me a gentle side hug, which I said was okay. \n\nSo that was a too long story to say, OP, you're NTA.

Not completely, but mostly. Many of the folks with high barrier disabilities who would try to intimidate or hurt their support staff at home will *seldom* attack someone in public. Often that's because they've had to deal with law enforcement in the past, and don't want to again. Sometimes it's because they've been kicked out of Walmart in the past and don't want to do that again. Nearly every one of the folks I've worked with has been capable of learning; many were resistant to changing their behaviors until what we call \"natural consequences\" metaphorically smacked them across the face.\n\nIn the care plan of the dude in question should have been something about helping him avoid touching other people, probably worded as \"learning to maintain personal space\" or something. There is no flocking way that he was able to respond to OPs request if he has that kind of trouble with boundaries in the first case. Folks who are able to comprehend stuff like boundaries were taught it at a young age the same as everyone else. There are those who need reminders; sometimes you have to go over part of their care plan with them before you take them into a store, for example. But I can as*sure* you this dude was not capable of responding to her request.\n\nIf someone advised me that one of the support staff who reported to me had handled something like this so poorly, they'd be sitting through a lot of really desperately boring retraining, after sitting with me while I droned on about our mission and goals, how we're setting an example for the people we support, how the eyes of the community are always upon us, etc etc ad infinite nauseum. I never liked writing people up, so if I didn't think I had to, I'd just try to bore them to death instead, and call it a verbal warning. You'd be surprised how often that worked. Or maybe you wouldn't. It's something I learned from my kid - she once begged me to spank her or ground her instead of lecturing her.\n\nOP is so NTA that it's laughable anyone would think otherwise.
