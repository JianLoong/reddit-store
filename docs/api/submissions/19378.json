I saw some people saying you should\u2019ve spoken to the man himself instead of his caregiver, and I agree that in general the person themselves should be addressed, but in this case I think it was appropriate to ask the caregiver. If you were at a bar and a strange man was touching you, you wouldn\u2019t ask him to stop, you would probably mention it to a bartender or security guard and ask them to speak to the man about it, so I think this is a similar situation.

Like, I think he only had 2 incidents in the 2.5 years I was there. And when you started at the office, they let you know what not to do around John. So most of the time he was SUPER sweet and wanted to be very affectionate. Whenever he came into the office, he wanted to run around and give all the women in the office big, very sloppy kisses on the cheek. I do not like having a big smear of anyone's spit all over my cheek, so when he would come running at me, I'd say \"Hi John! No kisses!\" in a friendly manner and he'd stop himself and just give me a gentle side hug, which I said was okay. \n\nSo that was a too long story to say, OP, you're NTA. While I agree that you could have asked the man not to touch you (and in a slightly nicer way), sometimes we don't think about this stuff in the spur of the moment and who knows if he was someone that had a trigger that could cause him to lash out.", "Seeing how he was touching himself as well as her, I think the care people being there is a big sign that it's best to talk to them and get them to handle him, rather than interacting with someone who had no problem invading her personal space while at the same time acting indesently.", "No, it's **a lot** ableist. By addressing the caregiver, instead of the man himself, OP made it plain that she doesn't see him as a person, that she's assuming he's incapable of understanding the request or controlling his own behavior.", "That\u2019s what I thought too.", "Lately the discourse surrounding SA committed by a disabled person is to claim that they either don\u2019t know better, or shouldn\u2019t be corrected. Let\u2019s stop dehumanizing these people even further, and hold them to the same standard. I also would argue the care taker is absolutely \u201cletting\u201d him touch, since she is seemingly responsible for a man in a womens restroom.", "It's also dehumanizing to have someone grab their private parts and then repeatedly invade your privacy and physically touch you for no reason.", "My answer as well. OP was more than within their rights to tell this guy to stop touching her, but OP instead addressed it to his caretaker like he was a dog jumping up on them and not a person. I guess it's an ESH not a YTA, though I don't think YTA is always intended to exclude the other person from also sucking.

Not all people who are in wheelchairs are mentally delayed to the point where it\u2019s okay to commit crimes without so much as a redirect by a care taker. That would be a lot to assume just by looking at them, don\u2019t you agree?", "she was very polite in a situation she did not have to be nice in. the ONLY thing that i would say she should have done differently is speaking directly to the man first instead of his caregiver. \n\nbut telling her she \u201ccould have saved herself some trouble by being nice\u201d in a situation where she was being grouped, is insanity.", "Nope. This comment is completely wrong. \n\nThe carers should have prevented him from touching strangers, for their safety and his, if he doesn't know any better. \n\nIt is *absolutely not* unreasonable to not want to be touched by a stranger, *especially* if you've just seen them grabbing at their genitals!\n\nYou seem to think that OP ought to have been a doormat in this situation. Perhaps you should examine why the idea of someone having boundaries makes you so uncomfortable.", "Maybe I'm a bad person but I really don't care about being rude to someone who is touching themselves and grabbing at me in public.", "Sorry stupid phone. Ride up waving and we would chat a bit. This went on for maybe a month and8 then he grabbed a very forcefully and agressively hugged me and wouldn't let go. I don't really remember much more I think he tried to kiss me. I was just terrified. I never walked home that way again and if I sae him, I ran. \n\nYou had every right to be uncomfortable.

This is an important thing for people learn regardless of their disability.\n\nOP also has a disability that means they struggle with being touched (autism is one in my country) why should OP have to allow themselves to be uncomfortable because the other persons disability is more visible?\n\nMy kids autistic and we teach him all the time to ask before touching or hugging people. It\u2019s not that difficult. OP NTA, and also not overreacting, *but* you should\u2019ve asked the dude himself before the carer.", "Absolutely not an overreaction to ask not to be touched.", "Man that\u2019s a huge assumption.

If it were someone without disabilities he'd be lambasted.", "Well he clearly can't control his own behaviour, otherwise he wouldn't have been groping himself and others in public. And most caregivers will probably tell you that it's safer to speak to them directly instead of their client/patient as they know how best to communicate with them, some people with mental difficulties often feel threatened, so someone snapping at them directly could be scary for them or aggravate them. If someone has a caregiver in public, they are there for a reason.", "He has already demonstrated inability to control own behavior, by self-touching and then touching her.

Because I'm uncomfortable.\n\nAnd no, he isn't disabled or anything, but when someone try to open the bathroom door with force every time I'm there despite the door being locked and the lights being on (both can be easily seen from the outside), I'm not talking to him.\n\nHe is 2 years older than me and I'm 21 btw, so no age thing as well\n\nIf someone touch me, and they are with someone else, I'll probably tell the other person to make them stop.

OP did nothing ableist.", "I could see an argument for the caretaker to intervene and for the caretaker to allow the person under their care to learn for themselves they can't just go touching other people.

Hell, the person who grabbed could have gotten hurt, I know some people with sexual trama who will flat out punch you if you grab them from behind out of instinct.\n\n The sort of disabled person who doesn't know enough not to grab a stranger often doesn't know their own strength and can hurt the people around them entirely by accident or because they don't really realize the kind of damage they are doing.

You are implying that disabled men are MORE dangerous. That really where you want to go with this?
