She did good for the first 6 months of his life but then in true kid fashion, lost interest and didn\u2019t take care of him anymore. I stepped in and basically raised the dog. I get up with him at 6am to let him out everyday. I pay for the vet bills and food. I take him outside multiple times a day so he gets exercise\u2026 Her first excuse was that she needed an emotional support animal and I complain about him sometimes so she wanted to take the burden off of me. I told her no because I feel like he would be miserable living in a dorm and that she would be too busy to properly care for him. He is a very active dog and barks a lot. She then flipped out on me and started accusing my husband of being abusive to children and animals and that\u2019s the reason why she wants to take the dog. Not true by the way. When that didn\u2019t work she went to my mom and dad and was nasty to them and made my 76 year old mother cry. On her birthday! When I didn\u2019t give in again she resorted to threatening to steal him while we aren\u2019t home. I called the college and explained the temperament of the dog to them and they agreed that he wouldn\u2019t be a good fit for the campus. \nNow she won\u2019t talk to me and is ignoring everyone else in the family. \nAm I the asshole for not letting her take the dog with her?\n\n\nEdit: I guess I should have said he raised his voice at her. Only after she would be disrespectful and it happened a handful of times in the span of 11 years. I shouldn\u2019t have said he yelled because people are taking it out of context. \nHe did yell at my son and my son yelled back.
