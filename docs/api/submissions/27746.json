Immediately.", "I\u2019m sorry but I think that would be awful for the dog.\n\nEdit: nta", "Well that escalated quickly.  Your daughter was way way way over the top making unfounded nasty accusations and then making her grandma cry *on her birthday* just to try and get her own way.\n\nINFO:  Has she acted like an entitled brat being manipulatively vile before? Perhaps she needs to be screened for her mental health?", "Definitely NTA. I have similar (and then some) mental health issues and convinced my parents to let me get a dog when we got sent home from college at the beginning of COVID. When I returned in the fall, I wanted to bring him as an ESA but my parents loved him too much and wanted to keep him. This was for the best as he would have been a TERRIBLE dorm dog (he\u2019s a beagle mix, so lots of barking and howling).  I did end up getting a dog my junior year once I was living in an off campus apartment and capable of affording adoption fees, food, vet visits, etc. And I still question whether he is living his best life with a college student. Dogs in college are really hard to manage.", "NTA. This level of emotional outburst and manipulation seems very skewed for the situation. It also is strange she doesn\u2019t see the consequences for her, the dog or the dorm. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I\u2019m guessing this was not happening before she went to college but now has increased significantly. I think she might need to move back home and speak with a psychiatrist and therapist. These outbursts could be the beginning of some severe mental health problems and should be addressed as soon as possible.", "NTA-But hopefully the school will require her to pay for a single room; it'd be really unfair for a roommate to suddenly have a dog in such a small space, especially when she won't take care of it.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised  if she gets one and then dumps the responsibility on a roommate or friend who feels bad for the dog.", "NTA. She called and yelled at her grandparents? She needs an ESA for her freshman year of college? Uhhh she needs serious therapy with a psychiatrist so they can prescribe drugs. She has anxiety issues and probably other mental disorders. Or\u2026she\u2019s very spoiled. Either way, good luck", "I love dogs but a blue heeler should never live somewhere where they dosn't have a lot of room to be active. They're a working breed and absolutely need a lot of physical exercise and mental stimulation to be well cared for.\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBringing a dog to a shared dorm would make someone an asshole, ESA sign-off or not.\n\nSometimes life is hard. Having a tough go at things does not make it OK to bring your pet into other people's spaces.", "She lacks the maturity to care for a living, breathing being that relies on a responsible human for all its needs.", "NTA whatsoever.  Your daughter is the one being abusive towards the poor dog!  You don't keep a Blue Heeler in a small environment like that....you just don't.   If she does take the dog, I can guarantee she'll only have it like a month tops before it gets a noise complaint.", "Yelling is not abuse.\n\nThe world is not filled with Mike Bradey\u2019s.", "I love dogs!! Putting a dog in a dorm room is cruel. I also think it is unfair to everyone living in the dorm. What if her roommate or other dorm occupants have anxiety around dogs????  Not everyone gets comfort from them.", "Yeah, a blue healer in a dorm room. That checks out", "The dog would be returned to OP within a week or two, or worse, sent to the pound, after it destroys something because of anxiety/boredom. Seconding your thanking OP on behalf of the dog and the roommates, because daughter taking the dog is such a terrible idea on so many levels for so many involved.\n\nNTA, OP", "On behalf of everyone in her residence hall, I thank you.", "Blue heeler owner here,  they are very energetic animals. A dorm room would not be a good place for them.", "My first dog as an adult and emotional support animal was a blue heeler x border collie mix. I was (and still am) a couch potato and the breed mix was completely random since when I adopted her Nyx was so filthy I couldn't even see she had markings. I thought I just had a scrawny black dog with floppy years, and after a bath and some food she was a full heeler\n \nIt was NOT the right fit, but I made it work for the two of us. Woke up at 4am every day to walk 1h before work. Another hour walk when I came back. Hiking on the weekends and lots of training to wear her out mentally\n\nI dedicated my entire life to her and it worked. A young woman just starting college has too much on her plate to add the stress of properly caring for a high maintenance dog", "My freshmen year someone on my floor snuck a cat into their dorm.  Then she went home for a weekend leaving the cat screaming alone in the dorm room.  Our RA had to unlock the door and report her.  I would argue that there aren't any (big) animals that are really suited to dorm life.", "You can't keep a heeler in a dorm room. Heelers need a lot of space and exercise. I agree, ridiculous option. A heeler (or two *cough*) especially one so young, would not be a good ESA either, and not something to have around just for companionship when you're not willing to look after it properly.", "Omg thank you for the Bluey reference", "Don't blue heelers incline towards the \"chow\" end of the chow-golden retriever spectrum? As in they like to have a small consistent social group and aren't great with strangers? And they're also pretty strong for their size and very intelligent. Awful breed for a college dorm.", "A couple of rats might be good ESAs for a dorm room, too. They can be very dog like and cuddly but don\u2019t need to be walked.", "A cat makes sense to me. Cats don't mind being inside and also don't always want attention, which is good for a college student, plus litter is easier than a walk. Though it is on the personality of the cat. One of my cats would love it, the other is sad when alone so he can't be an only cat.\n\nI'm glad it worked out for your son!", "I don't  have an ESA, but I do struggle with depression and anxiety and own two cats. On my worst days, when I don't even want to get out of bed or take care of myself, I can almost always still \"force\" myself to feed my cats because they rely on me for those things. It may be the only thing I do that day, but I still do it. If I had trouble with even that much, automatic feeders and automatic litterboxes do exist as an option to help augment normal feeding/cleaning tasks.\n\nESA's are really helpful for anxiety, which is different than depression and doesn't always interfere with animal care tasks. On bad anxiety days, my cats are a great comfort to me (they love to snuggle) and they do help calm me down.", "She is in counseling. And I have talked to her about all of the mental health stuff. She is a very strong willed person. I feel as though she is not using that great part of her personality in the right way.", "I\u2019m not a dog person at all but I love him to pieces. He\u2019s very smart and so sweet but man when he has an attitude he gets mouthy haha. I find myself talking to him like I would a toddler and he seems to understand what I say. I was playing ball with him today. He found another tennis ball and I threw it for him. He decided he didn\u2019t like that one and stood there staring at me. I said to him \u201c if you don\u2019t like that one go find your other one.\u201d He looked at me for a second and walked off to get the original ball that he liked.", "Honestly I don\u2019t think the daughter should be left around animals if she doesn\u2019t do any of the maintenance for the one she lived with and called her own.", "Hamsters need care, a lot of care like ensuring their water bottles are clean, fresh and filled, just like their food. Additionally, their cages need to be scrubbed and disinfected weekly with their bedding entirely changed to prevent diseases like wet tail. Same goes for any toys and cage accessories. Hamsters also likely won\u2019t pester you for something unlike a cat or dog, they\u2019ll waste away (they do bite on bars out of boredom or to prevent overgrown teeth though so they need activity, stimulation, and appropriate chewables \u2014 more needs). \n\nIt\u2019s work to care for a hamster, as well as for other small animals. \n\nI find cats easier to care for only because they live in the same home space as you (no cages or aquariums) and vet care is easier to find for them. They\u2019re also more capable of being vocal. But there, too, you need to ensure they have daily access to clean litter in a clean litter box, fresh water, food, you need to check their health, play with them, cater to their emotional needs (no leaving them alone all the time) and watch out for irregularities.\n\nI would not trust this girl with the care of any living thing.", "I never said he screamed at her and I edited my post saying he would raise his voice (not yelling but not talking in a calm voice) \nHe asked her to take the dog out. She said she was busy (she was watching a movie) he said that she wanted the dog so she needed to help take care of him. She got snappy with him and said he can\u2019t tell her what to do. He raised his voice at her and told her to go to her room and think about how she\u2019s acting. To her, he was yelling. Other times were when he would ask the kids to do their chores and he would get upset if they didn\u2019t do them. When that happened he would turn off the tvs or Wi-Fi until they were done. To her that was mean. \nMy parents told her the dog wasn\u2019t a good idea in the dorm. She then snapped at them and told them that she is an adult and she can do what she wants. She also said that they weren\u2019t very good people and don\u2019t do much for her. My parents have 21 grandchildren and do so much for all of them and all their children. They helped her get her car and are making the payments while she is in school. When she was in younger and had to be hospitalized for 2 weeks, my mom was right there with her and I for the whole 2 weeks. My parents are amazing! She has a history of being downright mean when she doesn\u2019t get her way. \nI\u2019m not sure what else to elaborate on. I glossed over the abuse thing because I know it\u2019s not true. \nWhen she started working SHE told me she wanted to help with the cost of her dog. I didn\u2019t expect her to pay for everything. I knew when we got the dog that I would be covering the cost of the dog. I was just putting out there that she has no financial responsibility for the dog. \nShe lost interest by not giving him food or water when he needed it. Basically letting the water bowl go dry until I or my husband got home. She didn\u2019t play with him anymore or take him out for walks. She wouldn\u2019t get up with him in the morning to let him out. Stuff like that. I wasn\u2019t treating her like she had to do every single thing for the dog. Just the basics that a teenager should be able to handle. If we were at work and she was at her friends house down the street and I asked her to go home for a couple minutes to let the dog out she wouldn\u2019t because she was too busy.", "Nuh uh clown.", "Surprised it took so long for someone to mention how destructive a Blue Heeler (with his OWN anxiety) could be, potentially, in a dorm room.

She'd crate the dog in her closet all day and the poor thing just howled the whole time. \n\nIt was horrible to live with and I felt so bad for the dog :( She sent him back home with her parents once he ate a dress through the bars of his crate (and I put in a few anonymous noise complaints from 'neighbors')\n\nSave the dog and save her roommates, NTA OP.", "The dog would develop behavioral problems either way, being stuck in a dorm room.

That motivating factor is interesting, how they \"force\" you into a routine. Thanks for taking the time to answer!", "There is a lot of entitlement to believe you can cut people out of your life, but expect them to continue to pay for you.  That is all, if you expect people to pay for you, then you don't cut them out of your life, if you decide to cut someone out of your life, no matter how much you believe that is justified, you are an AH if you expect them to keep paying for you.   \n     \nIt's pretty simple, you 100% have the right to remove people from your life, but when you do, don't be surprised if they pull support from you.", "I was just saying that I have been the care taker of this dog. I didn\u2019t expect her to pay for the vet bills. I just wanted her to do the basics of taking care of an animal. I didn\u2019t say my husband screamed at her either. He wasn\u2019t overly aggressive with the dog either. The dog was biting the kids and others and he corrected that behavior by being the alpha in the situation and not coddling him. He was never hurt or in distress. And now he doesn\u2019t bite anyone and isn\u2019t aggressive. If we coddled him he would most likely have that aggressive behavior. When my husband comes home the dog gets super excited to see him and they have their play time.
