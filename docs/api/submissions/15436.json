I asked my boyfriend to tell me before he goes poop because we share a bathroom\n2. Without any context, I agree this request sounds a bit controlling or invasive. But given the context that it\u2019s our only bathroom and we have this issue a lot, I think it would be considerate for him to give me the heads up.

Since it's your only one, if he is going to take that long, he should be courteous enough to tell you and give you the opportunity to go before he's in there for that long. It sounds like you both need to work on your communication skills as a couple, because this is a basic common courtesy.", "NAH. Just go to the toilet before you're desperate. He shouldn't have to announce his toilet habits if you're the one with the problem. That being said, 25 minutes is ridiculous, and that would probably get on my nerves, too.", "Seeing the comments about 25min being ridiculously long has me laughing. My brother used to take an hour shit (before cell phones were a thing to scroll through when pooping). Some people take long craps.\n\nIf you see him going for the bathroom- speak up in that moment and say, \"Can you hold on a minute, I gotta pee\". He is right that you should let him know (just as you want for him to let you know). You know your bladder well enough by now along with your bladder habits. \n\nNAH communication is a two-way street.", "I understand where OP is coming from. It also sounds like the solution they want will essentially keep their bf from taking a shit without getting permission first. That\u2019s a freedom many people cherish.

It is also the same as \u201cCan I take a shit or do you have to pee first?\u201d Both are asking for permission to take a shit with different wording. \n\nIf you\u2019re expected to ask this question before every morning constitutional, it\u2019s the same as being expected to ask permission beforehand. Some people are ok with that. Others aren\u2019t and want/need to use the bathroom at their own discretion. It\u2019s not fair for OP to force that expectation, especially as a mandatory daily thing. It is fair to ask if they\u2019d be ok with that, but they\u2019re allowed to say no. \n\nIt is also only polite to respect a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis when using any bathroom, especially when you wake up last and are aware of scheduling conflicts. \n\nThe fairest approach would be for both of them to make attempts at a resolution instead of expecting one SO to circumvent their needs to accommodate the other every time. That\u2019s not a team approach."]}
