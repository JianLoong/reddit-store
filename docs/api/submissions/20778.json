The only way that works is if we have the ability to be notified *anywhere we go* that an emergency is happening. Frankly, I think it is more than a little entitled to benefit from the protection of a system like ours but to object to hearing the alarm we would need to hear if *you* were the one in danger. I'm sorry you were upset by the false alarm, but personally I prefer it to real emergencies when lives are on the line.\"\n\nNTA.

I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be appreciative of you keeping that pager on you if her or a loved ones home were on fire and in need of emergency services.", "NTA. First of all, thank you for being a fire fighter. The manager was right - you have the pager for the safety of the public, and it wasn't your fault that it was a false alarm.\n\nAnd the lady was right - the village should not be supportive to entitled people, which is why I hope the responses to her rant were not positive.", "Easy NTA\n\n> That night I went on facebook to see the lady had posted a rant to the villages news group about how the village should not be supportive to entitled people. So AITA??\n\nTell her you agree - the village should not support entitled people like her. Her meal time is not more important than the village's safety.\n\nThe only person whose opinion matters is the owner, and their stance was clear. If the old lady doesn't like it, she should take her business elsewhere.", "NTA. My cousins are volunteer firefighters. I would rather hear those pagers go off wherever, including in church, than have someone die because their pagers were off. Thank you for your service and be safe.", "NTA. My dad was a firefighter and wore a pager for what feels like decades. \n\nCan you imagine being offended that someone else's house is burning down? I know that wasn't the case here, but she didn't know that. \n\nYikes.", "NTA. So would this lady not want your pager to go off if her house was on fire???", "NTA. Obviously.", "NTA.

That lady is just bay shit crazy! Hopefully the other villagers will straighten her out.\n\nEdit: bat, not bay", "NTA, my dad who was a volunteer firefighter always brought his for when the time came. Didn't matter where he was (other than wayyyy out of town).", "Lol! Way back in the day before pagers they used landlines with a special ring, and if the volunteers were not home but in town, we had the whistle. They still use the whistle \ud83d\ude03", "Sounds a lot less stressful than having to check every call/text on your phone to see if it's an emergency, tbh. I wouldn't be surprised if pagers made a comeback for people who only want to know about calls from one or two numbers but don't want the distraction of their smartphone on them all the time. \n\nI remember back when pagers were common, if you were going to a place like an orchestra performance you'd leave your pager at the desk and they'd quietly come and get you if it went off. Clearly this old lady has forgotten pager etiquette, because if the restaurant didn't provide this service, obviously it was not improper to wear a pager there.", "Fire whistles really confused me when I moved from the Midwest to an area with a lot of volunteer fire companies. What is used as a fire whistle where I am now is what I associated with a tornado siren, so they were slightly panic inducing until I knew what was going on.", "True. Where I am now, it's the tornado warning. Different lengths for different emergencies. IDK how it works in cities. \ud83e\udd37I never heard them in California."]}
