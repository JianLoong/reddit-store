The only way that works is if we have the ability to be notified *anywhere we go* that an emergency is happening. Frankly, I think it is more than a little entitled to benefit from the protection of a system like ours but to object to hearing the alarm we would need to hear if *you* were the one in danger. I'm sorry you were upset by the false alarm, but personally I prefer it to real emergencies when lives are on the line.\"\n\nNTA.

I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be appreciative of you keeping that pager on you if her or a loved ones home were on fire and in need of emergency services.", "NTA. First of all, thank you for being a fire fighter. The manager was right - you have the pager for the safety of the public, and it wasn't your fault that it was a false alarm.\n\nAnd the lady was right - the village should not be supportive to entitled people, which is why I hope the responses to her rant were not positive.", "Easy NTA\n\n> That night I went on facebook to see the lady had posted a rant to the villages news group about how the village should not be supportive to entitled people.

That lady is just bay shit crazy! Hopefully the other villagers will straighten her out.\n\nEdit: bat, not bay", "NTA, my dad who was a volunteer firefighter always brought his for when the time came. Didn't matter where he was (other than wayyyy out of town).", "Lol! Way back in the day before pagers they used landlines with a special ring, and if the volunteers were not home but in town, we had the whistle. They still use the whistle \ud83d\ude03", "Sounds a lot less stressful than having to check every call/text on your phone to see if it's an emergency, tbh. I wouldn't be surprised if pagers made a comeback for people who only want to know about calls from one or two numbers but don't want the distraction of their smartphone on them all the time. \n\nI remember back when pagers were common, if you were going to a place like an orchestra performance you'd leave your pager at the desk and they'd quietly come and get you if it went off. Clearly this old lady has forgotten pager etiquette, because if the restaurant didn't provide this service, obviously it was not improper to wear a pager there.", "Fire whistles really confused me when I moved from the Midwest to an area with a lot of volunteer fire companies. What is used as a fire whistle where I am now is what I associated with a tornado siren, so they were slightly panic inducing until I knew what was going on.", "True. Where I am now, it's the tornado warning. Different lengths for different emergencies. IDK how it works in cities. \ud83e\udd37I never heard them in California.", "You can have a different ringtone for specific callers.\n\nThough pagers have a much longer battery life, so they're more reliable.", "> You can have a different ringtone for specific callers.\n\nYeah, but I prefer to keep my ringtone turned off. And even for someone who doesn't, there might sometimes be places or times where there are reasons to have their phone off.", "NTA. when everyone carries a cell phone, how loud can a pager be? still must be much less distressing then a fire", "NTA\n\n\nWhy do fossil old ppl always mind other ppl's business?\n\n\nIt's not like OP did it on purpose to scare her. What if it was her or her loved ones in need?", "JFC if her blood sugar spikes at the sound of a pager, she better really hope there\u2019s never an actual fire within 50 miles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA My cousin and her husband are volunteer fire and EMT, when you're the only one in the area. You need to be able to respond. But their area has the alerts texted to them. Maybe see if your village qualifies for such an upgrade from the government?", "A lot of Australian firefighters use pagers. It's a quick way to inform members that there's an incident, and with the annoying beeping MIDI tone, it's pretty much unmistakable with any other device. \n\nOf course, phones and radios and such are used, but it's a good system for catching attention and emitting short bits of relevant data", "She\u2019s fine if *other people\u2019s* houses are on fire.", "There's definitely pros and cons. I've used my own cell for on-call and also have used a seperate cellphone. I used to also program and repair pagers and the infrastructure. Pagers are nice because they are usually smaller than a cell, but you can have it set to vibrate and know when it's work buzzing you during things like a movie. They are usually a bit more durable as well, which makes a big difference when you are expected to have it close by at all times. \n\nThe big downfall with a paging system is that they have limited coverage. Companies have to broadcast this signal themselves so it's usually at most city wide coverage. Even then, if you have a concrete basement, you might not be able to receive your pages. Like I said, definitely pros and cons on both ends.", "I would suggest that you post the explanation you posted here so the villagers know what really happened, and will appreciate how responsible their volunteer fire fighters are.\n\nNTA.  Not in the least.", "NTA, and thank you for your work.  If I managed that restaurant, I'd have kicked *her* out.", "UK doctor here. It's how we get contacted at work. It's a pain and they accidentally get dropped in the toilets at work. Especially when you sometimes have to carry up to 3 at a time.\nAnd yes we all have smart phones but finding a way to use them officially would be to sensible for management.", "Right? Wouldn't it be more efficient for a phone call?"]}
