He's already not respecting your - very reasonable - boundaries. I think you should reevaluate this relationship.", "ROFLMAO... he doesn't get an opinion on how often you shower.  Tell him to fuck right off thinking that you are obligated to even pretend to care about his opinion on you \"showering too much\".  \n\nTell him you find his habit of only showering every 3 days to be gross and he's obligated to listen to YOUR opinion and do what YOU think is right on his hygiene. \n\nNTA", "NTA - You\u2019re allowed to follow your own hygiene practices.

If showering everyday is necessary for you, then that\u2019s that. \n\nSure, showering daily technically costs more money and uses up more water, but he\u2019s extremely immature and you\u2019ve already explained to him why you shower everyday.\n\nCalling you an asshole and sulking in your garden because you don\u2019t want to do a bird bath is controlling and weird. If something as simple as your showering habits is such a big problem for him, this seems like it could be an unhealthy relationship.", "NTA\n\nYour BF is one of those ppl who's too stubborn and pushy with his beliefs.\n\nI'm sorry to say this, but he would only match someone with the same beliefs as his, unless he changes, which doesn't seem that likely", "NTA.

I think maybe this is an insurmountable incompatibility.

I didn't even finish reading it, but you're allowed to make your own hygiene choices and these people that are anti-hygiene really baffle me.

First visit and already a big fight over something stupid? Yeah, let this one go... This guy seems controlling and he lacks emotional maturity (plus, he is gross).", "NTA. Even if you didn\u2019t feel like you had to shower everyday you wouldn\u2019t be TA for doing so. \n\nI think this is a blessing in disguise because you can be sure he\u2019s going to try to influence other aspects of your life, as well. He needs to go", "NTA- kick him out early. That\u2019s a big red flag \ud83d\udea9- he\u2019s controlling and if this is how it starts- it\u2019s only going to get worse!", "NTA. It's understandable that you have different showering preferences based on your individual needs and body type. Your boyfriend's attempt to impose his views on you is not respectful, and his name-calling and sulking are not mature ways to handle a disagreement. It's important to communicate and compromise in a relationship, but in this case, it seems like he is not willing to listen to your concerns and needs. You have the right to prioritize your own health and hygiene.", "NTA, tell him to gtfo now!", ">Am I the asshole?\n\nNo, but you're dating one. Dude is a self-righteous fool carrying some big red flags. \n\nCan I ask, how did this eco-weenie get to your home? Did he bicycle or walk? Or were fossil fuels burned along the way? \n\nDistractions aside, he tried to hide his controlling behaviours (pertaining to *your* body) behind green-washing. You didn't fall for that. So now he's sulking, which is an ugly look on everyone except my cat  -- who is adorable even when he's pouting. \n\nLike, seriously, who decides that dictating *your* shower frequency matters more than his human duties of politeness, kindness, and being a good guest? OP stop giving him JADE (where you feel you have to Justify, Explain, Argue or Defend) 'cause he's not worth it. \n\nYou said this is your FIRST visit with him at your house?

I get caring about the environment, but that\u2019s an unbelievably minor thing in the grand scene of things.\n\nI guarantee there are 100s of their things you both do which are just as bad or worse for the environment and that\u2019s ok; unless you\u2019re spending every waking moment on environmentalism you always could be doing more, and the minimum effort where people draw the line morally obviously varies.\n\nPeople saying break up - I do agree it\u2019s kinda a red flag, but i like to assume the best. If the environment is something he\u2019s very passionate about it could be a blind spot for him that he just needs to be made aware of, or there could be something else affecting him that\u2019s making him act weirdly. I\u2019d just try and rationalise that he also dies things that are bad for the environment for convenience or pleasure - maybe eating avocados or driving instead of public transport - and what you consider acceptable is valid too", "NTA, I shower every evening, but I only wash my hair every 3 days. I piss and shit during the day and that always leaves residue. I'm not going to bed with that.", "OMG, you need to break up with him. The level of coercive control on this matter is not a red flag. It is a fire truck covered in red flags with the siren on. \n\nHow does his bathing every 3 days work for you?  What will you do on the third day in August with no air conditioning (terrible for the environment) if he wants to be intimate? Girl, run!", "Definitely NTA, let him mind his own hygiene, only YOU get to dictate how often you shower or not lol. It's your place, your bills, your body.", "NTA. Him not trusting your opinion, and not honoring your decisions, about your own body is a big red flag. Proceed with caution.", "Um, I think you should quickly figure out what other vales you're not aligned on and get rid of this disgusting person.", "NTA You and John are obviously two different people. You have very valid reasons to need to shower every day. But John is selfishly is refusing to listen to you. Perhaps it's time you and John go your separate ways.

It\u2019s your body and your choice when it comes to hygiene and everything else.  \n\nYou should tell him how grossed out you are about his hygiene.  It seems that this dude is a controlling, non-compromising jerk.  I\u2019d suggest reassessing this relationship.", "NTA. Send that man back from whence he came and then febreeze your entire house. You have every right to shower as often as you feel necessary. Once a day is hardly considered too much.", "NTA.  He's completely out of line.", "He can't tell you how much to shower and also you can't tell him either. What he does is very wrong, NTA.", "NTA. Just go ahead and file this relationship away as fail and move on.", "NTA\n\nWhat the actual fuck?

What Jedi mind meld has got you considering you could be in the wrong here?", "NTA and I would not sleep with a man who showered every 3 days, or anything less than daily.  Every 3 days is so gross and an instant deal breaker.", "NTA. His reaction to you not going along with his recommendation is a red flag and comments are hypocritical at best.\nIt's called personal hygiene and it's a personal preference.  You're not giving him a hard time for showering 2x week. You know your body and what you like.  Move forward with cautionOP", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with showering every day and there's nothing wrong with showering every three days, we all do what works for us. \n\nAnd with that, if you find his shower frequency gross, and he is serious about you showering less, I don't know if you guys are compatible. And that's okay. This seems like something neither of you want to change. I would cut my losses and find someone with more similar values.", "NTA. He is the one with unreasonable standards.", "NTA\n\nHe is a stinky person. There's nothing wrong with showering everyday. There are many countries in the global south where people shower everyday.

You both have different views, if you don\u2019t judge him for not showering everyday, he shouldn\u2019t judge you. \n\nI do understand his point of view, but it doesn\u2019t matter. You can choose to do whatever you want. Maybe just let him know you hear him and understand where he is coming from - but you don\u2019t wish to change, and he needs to accept that.", "Tldr, nta. How often you shower will not really make a difference when railroad companies are crashing their trains carrying toxic chemicals, oil refineries not following safety procedures, and nuclear reactors melting down. This is gaslighting from large companies, they place guilt on everyday people for small shit when the biggest polluters in the environment laugh their way to the bank. \n\nYou shampooing everyday isnt killing animals. Whats killing the environment is the apathetic companies not following regulations when they pump toxic substances into the water while making shampoo bottles. You saving shampoo isnt going to do anything. What will is voting and petitioning high fines on polluters and companies that dont maintain their equipment. Tell that to your high and mighty boyfriend\n\n\n\n\nUnsolicited advice from one oily person to another, Needing to wash your hair everyday is not normal. Yes you can be oily. I am, but this is excessive if youre not a teen with out of control hormones.  Use moisturizer,  seems counter intuitive, but for the face, moisturizer.\n\nFor hair, take prenatal vitamins. I always take them even if Im not pregnant. If your hair is that oily youre likely using the wrong shampoo. Try one without parabens/sulfates for a week or two, or maybe you have wavy hair that only appears straight and the oil from your hair freaking out is weighing it down. In which case, try shampoo for wavy hair. \n\nYou should be able to go every other day without a wash. I dont because I like bathing and culturally its what we do, but sometimes it doesnt happen when you have so many kids. Shower everyday bc you enjoy it, but if you have to, something is wrong.", "NTA why are you dating a stinky AH?

Showering every 3 days is just... no. I wouldn't be touching his privates on day 3. And him calling you an asshole for having basic hygiene? Hell no.
