She asked YOU. In private. \n\nAnd if the scars are from the drug abuse, then she may not have any frame of reference for what those scars look like. I mean.. I don\u2019t have anybody in my life that\u2019s struggled with addiction. So she just may not have realized.", "I was going to say NAH but then I saw you didn't prepare your gf in any way, shape, or form for this serious matter. Why on earth didn't you give her a heads up? Not everyone knows exactly what to do or say under such circumstances. And while yes, staring isn't polite, it doesn't necessarily mean she was being malicious.\n\nHer asking what happened was an opportunity for you to clarify, but you shot her down and condescended. No, it's not obvious. And if it's so serious, you could simply explain. Frankly, you should have prepped her beforehand. Idk why you expected her to be skilled and mastered in this arena and to read minds. You set her up for failure. YTA.", "YTA. She was blindsided. And I'm guessing the scarring is significant for her to have stared. You come across as extremely hostile toward her. I get being protective of a friend, but you want to spend your life with this woman and yet see her as a threat? Why didn't you do anything to prepare her? Why are you being vicious about her asking you in private what happened? She's not \"playing stupid\" she's trying to understand.", "YTA\n\nNo, it isn't necessarily obvious what happened. He could have been in an accident, he could be a cutter, and of course there is drug addiction. \n\nIt isn't the least bit rude to ask YOU the question when it's just the two of you.  If she had asked him I might agree with you, but that's not the case here. \n\nYou had a gross overreaction to a question that most people would ask in a similar situation. You owe her an apology", "YTA, While I hate to say it, you should have been more sensitive here. Your fianc\u00e9 may not have been playing stupid and could have been genuinely unsure. Not everybody has seen arms scarred from drug use. This may have been confusing for her. \n\nI understand that you are protective of your friend and really sensitive to anything that may appear as an attack on him, but you have to give your fianc\u00e9 the benefit of the doubt here. You probably should have said that her actions may have been interpreted as disrespectful. Unless you truly believe that she was being rude on purpose, your actions were a little more brash than they should have been.", "Info: was she aware prior to this that he's a recovering addict? Or did she honestly not know anything of his past and didn't want to make assumptions of the scars.\n\nBecause if I see scars on someone's arms I won't instantly go to addict or former self harm because I mean anything can leave a scar. I got tiny scars (thankfully healing fast because the cuts were superficial) from work! Because my clumsy ass got scratched by the metal door to the laundry chute. So those scars could be even from jobs. \n\nFrom your post it doesn't sound like they had much of a conversation or any kind of indepth talk. And your parents getting judgey because she's staring isn't exactly right either. She was in fact wrong for staring no doubts about that. A glance at first maybe a double take is understandable but continuing to look and stare kinda is a dick move on her part.", "YTA. She had no idea what she was walking into, you should have told her beforehand. \n\nAt the point that you've asked someone to marry you, you should be able to trust them with the story of your best friend (at least enough of it so she isn't blindsided in a social situation).", "YTA\n\n> I'm rethinking a few things now\n\nI hope she is rethinking things as well!   You spoke to her with contempt, you didn't prep her for the meeting and you are very quick to throw her under the bus.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t push for answers she was simply blindsided because she didn\u2019t expect it. And you all decided to not extend her any grace or understanding but instead blame her for being put on the spot. I am sure she didn\u2019t mean to stare but sometimes its really hard to stop, especially if you never faced something similar. \n\nYou made it clear she will never even remotely be as important as your friend.", "YTA! She was in obvious shock. She waited until you were alone to ask. You couldn\u2019t have told her without going into serious details? You want them to get along, yet you offer no explication to her of who he is and important details. I had a cousin who tried to unalive herself. I told my boyfriend BEFORE meeting her that it happened and if she\u2019s wearing short sleeves to try not to look shocked. Not everyone knows how to deal with those situations. \nYet you threw her in a situation totally unaware and expected her to figure it all out and literally got angry when she asked her safe person. (AKA\u2026 YOU) \n\nWhat happened to grace? If I were her I would break up. What happens in other situations with your friends or family,? you going to treat her like a child in those situations too? You could have just said, \u201chey, I know that must have been a shock. Sorry I didn\u2019t warn you. It\u2019s a sensitive subject, but I can try to answer any questions you have to the best of my ability.\u201d That\u2019s how stable adults answer.", "YTA\n\nThese are two people you care about and you want their relationship to go well. A simple heads up that he has a hard background and she might see things she is unfamiliar with would have gone a long way. You didn't need to go in depth, but you know her background. \n\nNot everyone is familiar with self-harm scars. I've had a horribly abusive life, and I only met someone with a history of SH socially recently. \n\nIs there any reason to think your fiancee is aware of SH and any who have struggled with it? \n\nMy BIL is a cook, and his arms are scared from burns. \nMechanics, carpenters etc there are many jobs that have a high risk of continuous minor injuries. That leave scars. \n\nYou also seem to have more care and concern for your friend than your fiancee.", "I can only assume needle scars? Color me as obtuse as your fianc\u00e9 if I am wrong.\n\nSo your fianc\u00e9 used this as a conversation entry point to try and learn more about your friend and his past. Little clumsy, maybe, but I\u2019d want to know if it was my fianc\u00e9 \u2018s best friend as well. \n\nYou do have some thinking to do. Your wife is your partner, your confidante, your family. There shouldn\u2019t be many taboo subjects, and the history of people you plan to inject in to her life shouldn\u2019t be one of them. There should be innate trust, and you shouldn\u2019t have to question if you can trust her to be supportive of you and your relationships with friends and family. If you aren\u2019t looking at this woman as such, you shouldn\u2019t have proposed in the first place.\n\nNAH here really. This seems like a big ole wake up call, and you both had better heed it. Jump in the pool or get your toes out, marriage isn\u2019t a halfway thing.", "YTA. Maybe she genuinely didn\u2019t know what the scarring was from. Maybe she did but wanted background as she knows he\u2019s been in your life for years. Maybe she was staring and asked questions because she cares for him as your best friend and was worried. Maybe she wanted to know how to support him. Maybe instead of everyone in your family judging her you could of all given her some kindness in a situation where she was not prepared. It sounds like she was socially inept and stared too much but it also sounds like she was gracious enough to not mention anything until she was in a \u201csafe space\u201d with you in private, where you acted like an AH and called her names.\n\nThis is enough to sour yours and your families opinion of her.\nI hope she has the same soured opinion, you all just threw her in the deep end during her first \u201ccasual\u201d meet up with your friend and then judged her for her reaction to something everyone else had the background knowledge of.", "YTA and so is your family and your best friend as well. You all suck. You just assume that your fianc\u00e9e would know what the hell drugs scars looked like. Fucking hell if your best friend wasn't a drug addict. Would you have known what those scars were? Or your parents for that matter.  I doubt it very highly. \n\nSo do her a damm favor and get off your high horse. Since you ae just being a judgmental AH. \n\nAnd you owe her a damm appolgy for your actions for throwing her to the wolves so to speak.\n\nAnd remember this your best friend will always have people stare at him becuase of his own actions. And he needs to accept that reality..", "YTA. I hope your fianc\u00e9 is rethinking a few thing, too.", "YTA. I hope you take the criticism here to heart and apologize to your fiance and then reflect on how you can have better communication between the two of you in the future. If my husband had spoken to me like that, after I approached him in private because of a situation I was completely unaware and unprepared for, I would have been seriously reconsidering my decision to marry him.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have stared. But she asked you in private. Jumping down her throat because she didn\u2019t automatically know what the scars were or what the larger story was was nasty.\n\nYou could have told her what you told us, that the scars were because \n\n>he had a pretty rough time in his late teens and early 20s. He was struggling with addiction issues, among other things to cope with shitty life circumstances.\n\nThen you could have added that the scars were from drugs? self-harm? both? (I\u2019m still not clear), that he\u2019s much better now but that more than that is really his story to tell and you don\u2019t feel comfortable adding details.", "YTA\n\nYou owe her an apology. I'm in recovery myself and no one knows what the scars are from unless I tell them. \n\nUnless your GF has dealt with addiction or knows about the physical scars that come with it, then how would her question be dumb?\n\nYou better hope she picks up that home because I'm thinking she too might be re-thinking a few things after how you and your parents made her feel.", "ESH. As an adult she should have been able to control her staring. Your \"don't play stupid\" comment was unnecessarily hostile and rude, especially when directed at someone you supposedly care about (but from this post don't even seem to like).", "Yta. Do you think all people know what track marks are? Hell, she coulda thought he had some sort of dialysis issues. Or disease caused that or child abuse. \n\nYelling at her after the fact instead of pulling her aside before or during to let her know not to be weird makes you doubly the asshole", "ESH.\n\nHer staring is quite rude, but that sounds like the only thing she did wrong here. Accusing her of playing stupid is an escalation in hostility that doesn't even make sense here. Even if she understands they are cutting scars or track marks, which she might not (or might think it's from an accident), that doesn't mean she knows what the story is. Similarly, not taking no for an answer would be extremely rude, but asking you about it privately is not; you didn't have to tell her anything, but you didn't need to insult her for asking.", "EDIT: YTA (after reading that you didnt prepare her whatsoever for it)\n\nShe shouldn't have stared like that, but your response to her question was incredibly harsh and out of proportion. Calling your SO stupid is always an asshole move. The entire \"brutal\" drive home could have been avoided if you had approached it with compassion and tried to help her understand instead of berating her. I say you should apologize for your reaction and try to help her understand. Even if it seems obvious to you, it may not have been for her. This is certainly not worth ending an engagement over.", "YTA\n\nThere are many reasons scars happen. Drugs, self harm, accidents. Just because the cause is obvious to you who was there doesn't mean that it's obvious to someone else. She's asking for help in understanding and you are blowing her off.", "ESH\n\nLook, she was wrong to stare. It's incredibly rude, and prying to ask personal questions of visible scars.

Her because her staring was so obvious that everyone noticed it, she could have just looked once and then asked you but nooo she had to keep staring.", "ESH\n\nIn a relationship, communication is key. If you wanted her to be prepared for meeting your friend and not be shocked or uncomfortable, you should explain beforehand. You don't even have to share his story to do that. A simple \"Btw, my friend has scars from his tough past. They are quite visible and it may be hard for him to talk about.\" probably would have been enough warning to allow her to prepare herself and not stare. You could've even pulled her aside at the get together and said \"hey, my family and I have noticed you staring, his scars are from his tough past, please try not to stare, it may make him uncomfortable\".\n\nI have scars. People stare, some rude, some shocked, some curious. I don't take offense. It's not the norm for some folks. I joke like your friend and don't let it bother me. It seems like it bothered you and your family more than him. Not saying that staring is okay, but it is kind of expected. Especially for a first meeting with someone so special, and it not being mentioned beforehand. I wouldn't take offense if someone warned a friend that I have scars before meeting me. \n\nAlso, you are more of an AH for your response. She may live a sheltered life where scars are as common as seeing a unicorn. To accuse her of playing dumb at her first inquiry about the scars is shitty. I hope you apologized and told her it's just a touchy subject for you. At least she waited until it was private and just the two of you. She could've easily been rude and judgy and just asked your friend directly, potentially ruining your get together.

But it isn\u2019t necessarily. I read comments about it possibly being drug marks, my first guess from reading was self-harm/cutting. \n\nSo OP maybe you gotta look more at her point of view. Playing dumb accusation pretty harsh. You could at least have been open minded and curious. She shouldn\u2019t have been staring, but she was probably looking so much trying to piece together the story- he\u2019s important to you so her trying to understand makes sense. So for a variety of reasons YTA.", ">Because if I see scars on someone's arms I won't instantly go to addict or former self harm because I mean anything can leave a scar.\n\nThese, in my opinion, are pretty obviously the latter of the two. However I can concede that experience with that sort of thing isn't the norm for everyone and that I was a little harsh in my delivery.\n\nEdit: Wow, I posted this answer without addressing the one thing you asked. No, she wasn't aware of his struggles.", "Yeah a lot for her to reconsider here.", "Your last sentence is spot on. Throughout the whole post, all I saw was concern for the friend. No concern or even respect for the fianc\u00e9e. OP, if you don\u2019t fully love, trust, and respect this woman, do not marry her. She deserves better. YTA", "I was thinking self harm scaring.", "I genuinely don\u2019t know why this is the only NTA.\n\nSeriously, do the rest of you people just openly stare at large or numerous scars? The fuck is wrong with you?\n\nShe knew she was staring.\nAs a person who\u2019s had large scars on my arms, it gets upsetting really quick.", "Big time disagree. It's not being nosy to ask for more information when your first attempt to find out what you did was met with \"dont play stupid\"", "Uhh... what? How was she nosy and a gossip for privately asking her boyfriend for more information? She didn't pry (because he was a dick, granted) and certainly didn't share anything; curiosity is not a sin.", "I think asking the friend would've been 10x worse", "I mean this with the most sincerity, but why? I understand not wanting personal stories of self harm, mental health issues, drug addiction, etcetera to be shared, but if someone has no idea how those things can lead to scarring, why is it an automatic sin for them to ask in private? One could've gotten those scars from an automobile accident for all they know. I agree that friends shouldn't divulge that information without permission, but I guess I don't understand the crime of ignorance/curiosity within itself.", "Why didn't you make her aware?", "You\u2019d be surprised how unaware people can be if they\u2019d never encountered it. I was 30 before I ever saw someone who had recovered\u2019s scars. They seemed so put together, calm and healthy that drug use did not cross my mind (i know you shouldn\u2019t assume but it seriously never entered my mind). I asked someone and they politely explained. \n\nThere is tension between your friend and gf that needs to be resolved but you can\u2019t get upset with her for asking a question. She may not have been exposed to this situation and assuming she\u2019s playing dumb and getting angry with her will only increase the tension with your friend while creating some between you two. \n\nYTA", " My boyfriend sent one of workers over to start painting my house.in the middle of the summer. He had more ingrown hairs on his stomach than I ever saw.on a guy. When I mentioned it to my boyfriend he informed me that when Dan shot heroin he used his stomach. So, no people aren't really that good at identifying one scar from another.", "Every recovering addict's scars are different. You'd never be able to tell what mind are from unless you asked. And I'd gladly tell you. Not make you feel stupid for asking or assume you'd know. You're a bigger AH because you KNEW she didn't know.", "That was my thought too and I was surprised to see so many top comments assuming scars from drug use. But this is also a great example of how OP sucks at conveying information.", "Ahhh, yes, that would be another possibility.", "His story is pretty well intertwined with my own at that point in our lives, but the ins and outs of what he went through still aren't mine to tell. I've introduced him to other friends of mine, like my buddies from college, and I had never experienced something like this before. I know he's said he avoids wearing short sleeves sometimes in public when he doesn't feel like having strangers do double takes, but I don't think either of us expected someone in this particular environment to react she did.", "But why couldn't you just prepare her for seeing the scars without giving all the details? I agree her staring was rude, but I also understand how someone might be taken aback if they're not used to that situation.", "Here's the thing, though. If you're introducing someone you love to someone else you love, and you know there's something sensitive that you don't want to come up or be an issue in conversation, a little heads up would solve a lot of problems. You threw her literally in the deep end of a topic she might be completely unprepared to deal with (she might have never had addictions/people with addictions in her life, or people that self harm/have serious mental health issues) and then not just you, but your family is upset that this unprepared person didn't handle something tastefully because she still wasn't even made aware of what happened. \n\nI have self harm marks. Really big, really bad ones. And occasionally, I'll run into people when I'm shopping that while ringing me up and trying to start up conversation, will ask what happened. Is it an overstep? Yes. But they might be thinking it's 'fell into a lawnmower/got in an accident', not 'gashed myself repeatedly because I have issues'. I don't want to make them feel awkward, so I've usually opted to answer with \"Oh, just youthful stupidity,\" and I smile and go on my way. You didn't prepare her at all. For anything. And you're shocked she had a reaction? You're not thinking clearly about this.", "YTA and so are your parents.", "Right? OP thinks she should know what these scars are from without being told. If it is so obvious that they are from addiction, then it isn\u2019t betraying any confidence to say \u201cmy best friend has some track marks on his arms. I just want to give you a heads up.\u201d She doesn\u2019t need a whole medical history to get a warning."]}
