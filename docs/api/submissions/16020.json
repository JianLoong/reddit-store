We live in two different states now so I don't get to see him as nearly as often as I would like, but we keep in touch through near daily facetimes and pretty constant texts.\n\nBecause of the distance, my fianc\u00e9e (27F) hasn't gotten many chances to meet him in person. We did facetime introductions and they've said brief hellos at a couple weddings we all attended, but they haven't been around each other in many non-formal circumstances. Anytime I see him otherwise, I usually go down to his place for the weekend by myself.\n\nHe had a pretty rough time in his late teens and early 20s. He was struggling with addiction issues, among other things to cope with shitty life circumstances. He distanced himself from everyone excluding myself and a handful of others. My family really rallied around him during this time to support him, even from afar, so I'd say all of us are pretty protective of him (they just have to be quiet about it since he isn't interested in anyone other than that aforementioned handful of people seeing him vulnerable.)\n\nLuckily, he's doing much better now. Last night, my parents hosted a little get together for my mom's birthday and he was invited. They live at a decent halfway point between us both so it works perfectly. It was the first time my fianc\u00e9e and him were around each other for more than a few hours in a more casual setting.\n\nIt became obvious quickly that they don't get along. It also became obvious that because their previous interactions had all included long sleeves, my fianc\u00e9e had never seen my friend's bare arms, which have scars on them. I caught her looking a few times over the course of the night, but I didn't say anything. I'm pretty protective over him, but I knew he could handle it himself if he was too bothered. Towards the end of the night, he did end up making a 'my eyes are up here' sort of joking comment.\n\nEven my parents pulled me aside at one point to mention it, and it's soured their view of her a little.\n\nWhen we got in my car on the way back, she almost immediately asked me what happened. After being frustrated over her behavior at the party, I told her not to play stupid. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what's up. She told me I was being a dick and that she just wanted more information, and I said it was incredibly rude to ask about things like that, even indirectly. It was a brutal drive home and I'm rethinking a few things now.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: For those asking why I didn't warn in advance - I've introduced him to people in the past and have never had a reaction like this. He is a human being, I don't exactly think he needs a warning label.

She asked YOU. In private. \n\nAnd if the scars are from the drug abuse, then she may not have any frame of reference for what those scars look like. I mean.. I don\u2019t have anybody in my life that\u2019s struggled with addiction. So she just may not have realized.", "I was going to say NAH but then I saw you didn't prepare your gf in any way, shape, or form for this serious matter. Why on earth didn't you give her a heads up? Not everyone knows exactly what to do or say under such circumstances. And while yes, staring isn't polite, it doesn't necessarily mean she was being malicious.\n\nHer asking what happened was an opportunity for you to clarify, but you shot her down and condescended. No, it's not obvious. And if it's so serious, you could simply explain. Frankly, you should have prepped her beforehand. Idk why you expected her to be skilled and mastered in this arena and to read minds. You set her up for failure. ~~YTA~~\n\nEdit: Amending my answer to ESH, since OP\u2019s girlfriend really shouldn\u2019t have stared.", "YTA. She was blindsided. And I'm guessing the scarring is significant for her to have stared. You come across as extremely hostile toward her. I get being protective of a friend, but you want to spend your life with this woman and yet see her as a threat? Why didn't you do anything to prepare her? Why are you being vicious about her asking you in private what happened? She's not \"playing stupid\" she's trying to understand.", "YTA\n\nNo, it isn't necessarily obvious what happened. He could have been in an accident, he could be a cutter, and of course there is drug addiction. \n\nIt isn't the least bit rude to ask YOU the question when it's just the two of you.  If she had asked him I might agree with you, but that's not the case here. \n\nYou had a gross overreaction to a question that most people would ask in a similar situation. You owe her an apology", "YTA, While I hate to say it, you should have been more sensitive here. Your fianc\u00e9 may not have been playing stupid and could have been genuinely unsure. Not everybody has seen arms scarred from drug use. This may have been confusing for her. \n\nI understand that you are protective of your friend and really sensitive to anything that may appear as an attack on him, but you have to give your fianc\u00e9 the benefit of the doubt here. You probably should have said that her actions may have been interpreted as disrespectful. Unless you truly believe that she was being rude on purpose, your actions were a little more brash than they should have been.", "Info: was she aware prior to this that he's a recovering addict? Or did she honestly not know anything of his past and didn't want to make assumptions of the scars.\n\nBecause if I see scars on someone's arms I won't instantly go to addict or former self harm because I mean anything can leave a scar. I got tiny scars (thankfully healing fast because the cuts were superficial) from work! Because my clumsy ass got scratched by the metal door to the laundry chute. So those scars could be even from jobs. \n\nFrom your post it doesn't sound like they had much of a conversation or any kind of indepth talk. And your parents getting judgey because she's staring isn't exactly right either. She was in fact wrong for staring no doubts about that. A glance at first maybe a double take is understandable but continuing to look and stare kinda is a dick move on her part.", "YTA. She had no idea what she was walking into, you should have told her beforehand. \n\nAt the point that you've asked someone to marry you, you should be able to trust them with the story of your best friend (at least enough of it so she isn't blindsided in a social situation).", "YTA\n\n> I'm rethinking a few things now\n\nI hope she is rethinking things as well!   You spoke to her with contempt, you didn't prep her for the meeting and you are very quick to throw her under the bus.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t push for answers she was simply blindsided because she didn\u2019t expect it. And you all decided to not extend her any grace or understanding but instead blame her for being put on the spot. I am sure she didn\u2019t mean to stare but sometimes its really hard to stop, especially if you never faced something similar. \n\nYou made it clear she will never even remotely be as important as your friend.", "YTA! She was in obvious shock. She waited until you were alone to ask. You couldn\u2019t have told her without going into serious details? You want them to get along, yet you offer no explication to her of who he is and important details. I had a cousin who tried to unalive herself. I told my boyfriend BEFORE meeting her that it happened and if she\u2019s wearing short sleeves to try not to look shocked. Not everyone knows how to deal with those situations. \nYet you threw her in a situation totally unaware and expected her to figure it all out and literally got angry when she asked her safe person. (AKA\u2026 YOU) \n\nWhat happened to grace? If I were her I would break up. What happens in other situations with your friends or family,? you going to treat her like a child in those situations too? You could have just said, \u201chey, I know that must have been a shock. Sorry I didn\u2019t warn you. It\u2019s a sensitive subject, but I can try to answer any questions you have to the best of my ability.\u201d That\u2019s how stable adults answer.", "YTA\n\nThese are two people you care about and you want their relationship to go well. A simple heads up that he has a hard background and she might see things she is unfamiliar with would have gone a long way. You didn't need to go in depth, but you know her background. \n\nNot everyone is familiar with self-harm scars. I've had a horribly abusive life, and I only met someone with a history of SH socially recently. \n\nIs there any reason to think your fiancee is aware of SH and any who have struggled with it? \n\nMy BIL is a cook, and his arms are scared from burns. \nMechanics, carpenters etc there are many jobs that have a high risk of continuous minor injuries. That leave scars. \n\nYou also seem to have more care and concern for your friend than your fiancee.", "I can only assume needle scars? Color me as obtuse as your fianc\u00e9 if I am wrong.\n\nSo your fianc\u00e9 used this as a conversation entry point to try and learn more about your friend and his past. Little clumsy, maybe, but I\u2019d want to know if it was my fianc\u00e9 \u2018s best friend as well. \n\nYou do have some thinking to do. Your wife is your partner, your confidante, your family. There shouldn\u2019t be many taboo subjects, and the history of people you plan to inject in to her life shouldn\u2019t be one of them. There should be innate trust, and you shouldn\u2019t have to question if you can trust her to be supportive of you and your relationships with friends and family. If you aren\u2019t looking at this woman as such, you shouldn\u2019t have proposed in the first place.\n\nNAH here really. This seems like a big ole wake up call, and you both had better heed it. Jump in the pool or get your toes out, marriage isn\u2019t a halfway thing.", "YTA. Maybe she genuinely didn\u2019t know what the scarring was from. Maybe she did but wanted background as she knows he\u2019s been in your life for years. Maybe she was staring and asked questions because she cares for him as your best friend and was worried. Maybe she wanted to know how to support him. Maybe instead of everyone in your family judging her you could of all given her some kindness in a situation where she was not prepared. It sounds like she was socially inept and stared too much but it also sounds like she was gracious enough to not mention anything until she was in a \u201csafe space\u201d with you in private, where you acted like an AH and called her names.\n\nThis is enough to sour yours and your families opinion of her.\nI hope she has the same soured opinion, you all just threw her in the deep end during her first \u201ccasual\u201d meet up with your friend and then judged her for her reaction to something everyone else had the background knowledge of.", "YTA and so is your family and your best friend as well. You all suck. You just assume that your fianc\u00e9e would know what the hell drugs scars looked like. Fucking hell if your best friend wasn't a drug addict. Would you have known what those scars were? Or your parents for that matter.  I doubt it very highly. \n\nSo do her a damm favor and get off your high horse. Since you ae just being a judgmental AH. \n\nAnd you owe her a damm appolgy for your actions for throwing her to the wolves so to speak.\n\nAnd remember this your best friend will always have people stare at him becuase of his own actions. And he needs to accept that reality..", "YTA. I hope your fianc\u00e9 is rethinking a few thing, too.", "YTA. I hope you take the criticism here to heart and apologize to your fiance and then reflect on how you can have better communication between the two of you in the future. If my husband had spoken to me like that, after I approached him in private because of a situation I was completely unaware and unprepared for, I would have been seriously reconsidering my decision to marry him.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have stared. But she asked you in private. Jumping down her throat because she didn\u2019t automatically know what the scars were or what the larger story was was nasty.\n\nYou could have told her what you told us, that the scars were because \n\n>he had a pretty rough time in his late teens and early 20s. He was struggling with addiction issues, among other things to cope with shitty life circumstances.\n\nThen you could have added that the scars were from drugs? self-harm? both? (I\u2019m still not clear), that he\u2019s much better now but that more than that is really his story to tell and you don\u2019t feel comfortable adding details.", "YTA\n\nYou owe her an apology. I'm in recovery myself and no one knows what the scars are from unless I tell them. \n\nUnless your GF has dealt with addiction or knows about the physical scars that come with it, then how would her question be dumb?\n\nYou better hope she picks up that home because I'm thinking she too might be re-thinking a few things after how you and your parents made her feel.", "ESH. As an adult she should have been able to control her staring. Your \"don't play stupid\" comment was unnecessarily hostile and rude, especially when directed at someone you supposedly care about (but from this post don't even seem to like).", "Yta. Do you think all people know what track marks are? Hell, she coulda thought he had some sort of dialysis issues. Or disease caused that or child abuse. \n\nYelling at her after the fact instead of pulling her aside before or during to let her know not to be weird makes you doubly the asshole", "ESH.\n\nHer staring is quite rude, but that sounds like the only thing she did wrong here. Accusing her of playing stupid is an escalation in hostility that doesn't even make sense here. Even if she understands they are cutting scars or track marks, which she might not (or might think it's from an accident), that doesn't mean she knows what the story is. Similarly, not taking no for an answer would be extremely rude, but asking you about it privately is not; you didn't have to tell her anything, but you didn't need to insult her for asking.", "EDIT: YTA (after reading that you didnt prepare her whatsoever for it)\n\nShe shouldn't have stared like that, but your response to her question was incredibly harsh and out of proportion. Calling your SO stupid is always an asshole move. The entire \"brutal\" drive home could have been avoided if you had approached it with compassion and tried to help her understand instead of berating her. I say you should apologize for your reaction and try to help her understand. Even if it seems obvious to you, it may not have been for her. This is certainly not worth ending an engagement over.", "YTA\n\nThere are many reasons scars happen. Drugs, self harm, accidents. Just because the cause is obvious to you who was there doesn't mean that it's obvious to someone else. She's asking for help in understanding and you are blowing her off.", "ESH\n\nLook, she was wrong to stare. It's incredibly rude, and prying to ask personal questions of visible scars.

Her because her staring was so obvious that everyone noticed it, she could have just looked once and then asked you but nooo she had to keep staring.", "ESH\n\nIn a relationship, communication is key. If you wanted her to be prepared for meeting your friend and not be shocked or uncomfortable, you should explain beforehand. You don't even have to share his story to do that. A simple \"Btw, my friend has scars from his tough past. They are quite visible and it may be hard for him to talk about.\" probably would have been enough warning to allow her to prepare herself and not stare. You could've even pulled her aside at the get together and said \"hey, my family and I have noticed you staring, his scars are from his tough past, please try not to stare, it may make him uncomfortable\".\n\nI have scars. People stare, some rude, some shocked, some curious. I don't take offense. It's not the norm for some folks. I joke like your friend and don't let it bother me. It seems like it bothered you and your family more than him. Not saying that staring is okay, but it is kind of expected.

I hope you apologized and told her it's just a touchy subject for you. At least she waited until it was private and just the two of you.

You have no way of knowing what was going on inside of her mind, that\u2019s why a dialogue would have been helpful to give you some context from her perspective. Again, she may not be fully aware of what these scars are. No, it doesn\u2019t give her an excuse to stare. But that\u2019s *not* what you\u2019re asking us here.\n\n3. It would have been better to say \u201cadmittedly, I\u2019m feeling frustrated right now by your constant staring at my friend\u2019s arms during dinner, to the point that they felt they should comment on it. However, I\u2019m feeling really angry right now, and don\u2019t feel ready to  talk about it at this moment. When I am, we can talk about what happened\u201d which is completely reasonable. \n\nEssentially, your anger caused you to handle the situation immaturely, but that doesn\u2019t negate that she was being immature for staring. I think you should *both* rethink a few things, as even beyond the event that took place, it\u2019s clear that healthy communication under pressure is seriously lacking here.", "Have people forgotten how communication works? \n\nThis is on you.\nBefore the party, all you had to do was say, \"hey, Max has been through a really tough time and he's only just beginning to come out of it.

If she was rude after that warning, it would be on her.

I suspect track marks fall into the same category.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you can never expose your scars, but you have to be judicious about time and place.

Where is it a normal reaction to gawk at people with scars or disabilities? \n\nFor a literal child yes who will ask \"why do you have one leg?\" \"Mister why do you have scars?\" But not for a ducking adult.\n\nShe's never seen a handicapped or disabled person? It's one thing to have an immediate reaction  in the moment, but nobody should need a pep talk to tone it down.", "It literally says that in the text lol", "If BFF needs help, financial or otherwise, OP doesn't think he needs to justify giving spending money or time with BFF over her.", "Me, who forms atrophic scar tissue, often not even being aware of the injury leaving behind the scar: I wish I may, I wish I might (lol)", "Because it's not his place to talk about it. I'd feel bitter if my best friend decided to tell anyone that I'm bound to know about my SH, at least without asking me first. I get mentioning the tough times, but SH is just something extremely private", "It's part of someone else's life that is none of her business. Do you think OP knows every private detail of all of her friend's lives? \ud83e\udd14", "Communicate about what? Keeping her eyes to herself and behaving like an adult? Other people\u2019s bodies aren\u2019t her business or OPs business. I have a friend with quite a few scars on his arms and chest. I know how he got them, but if I didn\u2019t I would know it\u2019s rude keep staring at them. It\u2019s also l not OP\u2019s responsibility to give any information OP\u2019s friend did not give himself. You wouldn\u2019t stare at a disabled veteran\u2019s injured leg the same way you don\u2019t stare at people\u2019s self harm or drug abuse scars.", "Of course it\u2019s extremely private, something that you would only ever tell your most trusted inner circle, eg\u2026your fianc\u00e9. I tell my partner loads of stories that are \u201cnot mine to tell\u201d. In general, it\u2019s just what couples do. Not always in explicit detail, but a brief overview? A two sentence summary at least so he doesn\u2019t put his foot in it? Yeah, definitely.", "I didn\u2019t say that he had to give the full story. Just giving her a heads up and saying it\u2019s the friends story to tell is enough. \n\nMy wife\u2019s friend had a similar story. She shared the bare minimum so I wouldn\u2019t be shocked because she knew I had a sheltered life. I\u2019ve been lucky in life that I haven\u2019t had to deal with the aspects others have. My life has been an easy one but I can\u2019t say how I would have been if I went in blind.   \n \nI don\u2019t think I would gawk but maybe I would have looked more if I didn\u2019t have that small heads up. \n\nCommunication matters and I\u2019m glad that my wife trusts me enough to give me small details to prepare me", "absolutely, glad someone\u2019s saying this. i saw *so* many comments about being given a \u201cheads up,\u201d and OP being TA for not doing it, but they\u2019re just scars, and people have to deal with that. i have visible self harm scarring myself, and not only is it alienating and dehumanising for others to require that people need a \u201cwarning\u201d for you, it\u2019s also none of their business. the scars could, in theory, have been from anything, but warning someone of drug addiction scarring or self harm scarring that another person has specifies the struggles that they may have wanted to keep in the past or private.\n\ni may be downvoted for this, but OP\u2019s gf should not have been staring and she did not need a warning. it is her responsibility how she reacts to people having scars, no matter how much of a stranger or friend they are. OP is not TA for not \u2018warning\u2019 her. like you mentioned as well, i agree he escalated quite a bit. but it is also understandable that it was upsetting to 1) see how she stared the whole night and 2) immediately asked what happened. he could have said it\u2019s not his place to say and asking can be rude, but i don\u2019t think his reaction was a massive overreaction for the context. i\u2019m leaning ESH, both the gf and OP needed to be more tactful", "How do you react in public if you see a person in a wheelchair missing a limb or a little person or someone that has a scar on their face? Do you continually gawk until they tell you my eyes are up here? Or do you avert your eyes?  A civilized adult does not stare at someone for any reason with or without warning.", "I agreed with everything you said up until the final sentence. We are judging OPs response, and OP responded with essentially \u201cdon\u2019t play dumb, it\u2019s incredibly rude to ask me questions about it.\u201d If she truly has no idea why those scars are there, then I think it\u2019s perfectly legitimate to ask your SO in *private*, as long as she accepts the answer of \u201cthat\u2019s not my story to tell.\u201d Both were AH, just at different points in the night."]}
