At first it was my mother (54F) who received the money on her account. But as soon as I turned 18 in 2022, the money started going to my account. My mother immediately told me to sign a document that would allow her to keep receiving the money on her own account, and when I refused, she yelled at me, and generally tried to guilt trip me into caving in. So I felt like I had no choice. Fortunately, my country\u2019s law didn\u2019t allow it, so I kept receiving the money. Then she told me to transfer the money to her. So I did. But she only allowed me to keep a ridiculously small part of it. (The social pension is around 614 USD, she only let me keep \u2248 25 dollars. Then her final \u201coffer\u201d was 50.) I just want to be independent with my own money. Save for college, my future, etc. Yet she claims that I will only waste it for treats. Yesterday, I had enough. At first I asked her to let me leave \u224875 USD for myself. She said no. So I didn\u2019t send her anything. She called me cruel and greedy. And told me that she is ashamed of my behavior, and that I should be ashamed too. She then told me that this money helped her survive when we were poor\u2026 few years ago. Saying that was most likely another attempt to guilt trip me as nowadays, she and my stepfather are prosperous. They buy themselves new cars quite frequently, buy expensive dinners for themselves from time to time, and could afford extensive renovations in our house, purely to make it more aesthetically pleasing. She also claimed that she has to pay bills and my expenses with that money. When I said that I could chip in, and pay for whatever bills I generate, she of course, refused. After shouting at me yesterday, she have been giving me the silent treatment. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.
