I just want to be independent with my own money. Save for college, my future, etc. Yet she claims that I will only waste it for treats. Yesterday, I had enough. At first I asked her to let me leave \u224875 USD for myself. She said no. So I didn\u2019t send her anything. She called me cruel and greedy. And told me that she is ashamed of my behavior, and that I should be ashamed too. She then told me that this money helped her survive when we were poor\u2026 few years ago.

She also claimed that she has to pay bills and my expenses with that money. When I said that I could chip in, and pay for whatever bills I generate, she of course, refused. After shouting at me yesterday, she have been giving me the silent treatment. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.

Either way, you're going to have to put down some boundaries.", "Don't do what she says\n\n\nAs simple as that\n\n\nShe is just trying to take money from you...", "I would suggest you do this or find someone to rent h u bedroom with. Nta.", "So\u2026. Let\u2019s go super cheap budget. $10 a day to eat? $10 a day to rent a room? Check is now gone.\n\nOP can\u2019t cover their own room and board with that check. Anywhere. And that is exactly my point.", "Right?\n\nAnd I did make a mistake here and assume on this one that it was also in the US. My stance has been consistent with both, it is amazing how feedback to this post seems exact opposite of the other.", "My wife's mother died shortly before her 17th birthday. Her dad stole all but one of her survivor's benefits checks. He was more physically violent than OP's egg donor when my wife brought it up. Both are still abusive assholes who have no right to the money.", "Thanks, I was mid thinking two things at once. Corrected", "Also\u2026 she is in no position to negotiate. You have the power because the money comes to you. \n\nShe could kick you out but you still have the money.", "Then move out. The money is meant for you. Otherwise it would go to her.", "Move out and pay an adult rent", "Bow your head in shame and move on.", "One doe's not negotiate with terrorists ( sorry I had to get that one in \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude02)", "Money like this, which you get because one parent dies, is to insure the children are provided with things they need to live. So that the remaining parent is able to buy food, pay for rent and utilities etc.", "It's getting downvoted because OP said that she is okay with paying bills but the mother isn't allowing her. Please read properly.", "Because OP has made it clear more than once that they offered to pay for expenses to their mother but she refused. This person has commented several times, they are a dog with a bone and they\u2019re also just plain wrong.", "they are not asking for both sides of the coin. they are literally offering rent and utilities, which mother refuses. The mother is also remarried and otherwise doing quite well. It\u2019s not the mothers money.", "Maybe because it is her money in her country.\n\nOP is not American.", "It'd be cool of you took a moment to step back and maybe read again the post and comments OP has made. This is not american money or the US they speak of so you are being incredibly ignorant with just HOW MUCH money this really is. \n\nYour point is mute. They CAN afford to live on their own with the money but the mother keeps taking it so they cannot move out without saving for a security deposit.\n\n\nOP has offered multiples times to pay her own way and it's still not enough. Mother wants it all. Husband may have passed but she's got a new husband now to support her. She's not some single mother struggling by herself", "Ok but it takes time to find a place so start looking. By the time you find availability you\u2019ll have the money", "save all of it. don't give her a cent. \n\nmake up an excuse for why you need to keep it - say you bought stocks. or that put it in a high-interest earning account, and if she's patient she will get even more money soon, and you can still keep a little for yourself (obviously she won't get anything, but there's a small chance she will leave you tf alone for a while. you know her best, so you decide what excuse is best.)\n\nlock away your valuables, passport, birth certificate, bank details, other important documents. get a safe and a lock. \n\nhave a getaway plan. a backpack with essentials. \n\nif you haven't already, find a part time job. if possible dont tell her how many hours you're working and definitely tell her you're earning less than you are. if possible get a new bank account at a different bank to receive your salary or ask to be paid in cash.\n\nmost importantly - be nice to her. maintain your relationship as it is now. business as usual. she will be suspicious as it is - try not to feed into her narcissistic behaviour. (i know the type :/ and im sorry)\n\nstand your ground. soon you will be free.\n\nyou will be okay. i promise you. \n\nand your dad would be proud of you.\n\ntake care OP."]}
