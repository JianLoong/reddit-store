At first it was my mother (54F) who received the money on her account. But as soon as I turned 18 in 2022, the money started going to my account. My mother immediately told me to sign a document that would allow her to keep receiving the money on her own account, and when I refused, she yelled at me, and generally tried to guilt trip me into caving in. So I felt like I had no choice. Fortunately, my country\u2019s law didn\u2019t allow it, so I kept receiving the money. Then she told me to transfer the money to her. So I did. But she only allowed me to keep a ridiculously small part of it. (The social pension is around 614 USD, she only let me keep \u2248 25 dollars. Then her final \u201coffer\u201d was 50.) I just want to be independent with my own money. Save for college, my future, etc. Yet she claims that I will only waste it for treats. Yesterday, I had enough. At first I asked her to let me leave \u224875 USD for myself. She said no. So I didn\u2019t send her anything. She called me cruel and greedy. And told me that she is ashamed of my behavior, and that I should be ashamed too. She then told me that this money helped her survive when we were poor\u2026 few years ago. Saying that was most likely another attempt to guilt trip me as nowadays, she and my stepfather are prosperous. They buy themselves new cars quite frequently, buy expensive dinners for themselves from time to time, and could afford extensive renovations in our house, purely to make it more aesthetically pleasing. She also claimed that she has to pay bills and my expenses with that money. When I said that I could chip in, and pay for whatever bills I generate, she of course, refused. After shouting at me yesterday, she have been giving me the silent treatment. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.

She never informed me about it. I wanted to make an agreement with her, I said I could use the money to cover my expenses, pay for my food, etc. But she never listened.

Don\u2019t get to have the checks and be an adult while also living off mom as a child\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly a legality fluke. This is a government issued survivor benefit, and ends once graduated from high school, or 19. If the child hasn\u2019t yet graduated and hits 18, it,flips to being paid in the child\u2019s name. But that\u2019s the only thing that changed. Still living in the same place, costing the same for mom to provide for. \n\nSo anyhow, surely, this now adult has to pay room and board, right? After all, all adults needs to pay their way through life. I have an idea on the rate. **The amount of the check.**", "Yes. I offered her to cover my expenses, yet she never listened.

She has been receiving the money from the state, following my father\u2019s death, instead of child support. As they were divorced. The money is going to be sent to me, until I turn 26.

She had AMPLE time to prepare and not commit to new cars or fancy house renovations. Because that's the kind of thing a halfway decent parent gives up rather than attempt to bleed their child dry. And if she *did* need OP to pay rent in order to remain financially solvent, she needed to sit down and hammer out an actual rent agreement ahead of time rather than attempting to emotionally abuse OP into giving up ALL of the money.\n\nI think it's weird that you're \"flabbergasted\" not everyone takes such a heartless, pecuniary view of family relationships.", "I do live with her, at least before I get accepted into college.

These checks will stop one graduated from high school or 19, whichever comes first.", "You\u2019re guessing wrong about what this thing is and how it works.  It\u2019s a state-paid support given to the survivors, typically separate ones for the surviving spouse and each kid.  While the kid is underage, it\u2019s all sent to the surviving spouse, but as the kid(s) come of age, they start getting their portion paid directly to them.\n\nYou can\u2019t do anything with a will to alter that because it\u2019s a state provided thing.", "It is a survivor\u2019s benefit from the government. Dad has passed. It is meant to provide household support to the single parent and their children.\n\nIt\u2019s not via will. Via technical language, it flips to the child\u2019s name if they hit 18 and are still in high school. It will end when they graduate high school or hit 19, whichever comes first. \n\nSo one can make the case the OP is an adult now\u2026.. sure. The state did. But now\u2026.. Pay rent and board then.
