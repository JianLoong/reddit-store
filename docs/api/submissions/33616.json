Then I'd re-evaluate my NAH rating.", "YTA. That would feel weird. It's not like he had a relationship with her. If you wanted to make him part of the ritual you needed to tell him she's dead before inviting him over and how you and your friends still talk to her and based on his reaction to that you could ask if he wants to meet her. Not everyone talks to dead loved ones so asking him to talk to a dead stranger was assuming a lot.", "NAH. It\u2019s weird that he would call you an AH over that. I can understand him being taken aback, but calling you an AH is disproportionate", "NAH. I think your tradition is sweet, I can also see why your boyfriend would be blindsided by the situation as it happened. \n\nI do feel it would've been good to mention the situation bforehand, but people deal with grief in different ways so its understandable why you didn't bring it up.\n\nI think its worth to have a honest conversation about the situation and give some acknowledgement of your bfs feelings.

It sounds like it freaked him out a bit. Maybe there\u2019s something else going on with him that he reacted like that. \n\nI would apologize for the mistake and making him upset.

When did it happen?'\n'Last year - its all cool now. Was just something of habit we say!'\n\nI would have then said hello each time. Its quirky and fun. Why get angry about shit like that? Honestly - would make me question his responses to major events he would actually be involved in!", "NAH. It\u2019s something that you\u2019ve normalized and so it isn\u2019t a big deal for you. He may have never been around someone\u2019s ashes before and losing loved ones affects us all differently. You two just have different experiences that shaped your  reactions to what happened last night. \n\nWhen I was around 16-17, I was hanging out with my best friend and she took me to the house of someone she was friends with. When I sat down in his living room he plopped an urn on my lap and introduced me to his father. I definitely had a brief WTF moment. \n\nI would imagine going to someone\u2019s house to spend the night for the first time and having the surprise introduction to your mom\u2019s ashes was probably a bit of a mood killer.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t like you demanded/forced him to say hi to her. you just said it out of habit as it\u2019s kind of a little joke between you and your friends. he isn\u2019t owed a sit down where you explain to him your mum\u2019s dead. you can tell him however and whenever you want. and it doesn\u2019t even sound like you intended to tell him anything at that moment, which is 100% fine. he shouldn\u2019t get annoyed with you for that\u2014it\u2019s weird behaviour to think you\u2019re entitled to someone telling you about their dead parent when you\u2019ve only known them a few months and aren\u2019t that close. \n\nalso im a bit confused on this part, but i\u2019ll just say if he\u2019s getting annoyed that you laughed about her death then he\u2019s being ridiculous. it\u2019s your grief to laugh about and joke about how you want.", "NAH.\n\nThis is completely normal to you, so it\u2018s understandable that you didn\u2018t think much of it. Likewise, it\u2018s understandable that being told about your mother\u2018s death in this way was weird for your boyfriend.", "YTA. Good way to end a relationship. You know all the context and what makes this \"funny.\" He doesn't.", "NAH, death is difficult for people, you should have given him a heads up, his reaction was very harsh I'd say.", "NAH death is a topic that people approach differently.", "YTA\u2026you blindsided him with a \u201ctradition\u201d you had never explained, then laughed at his confusion. How would you not be the asshole here? It\u2019s never ok to put someone in a position where they don\u2019t know what\u2019s expected of them or why, and then laugh at them when they don\u2019t know what the hell is happening.", "NAH.\n\nEveryone grieves and deals with death differently. You aren't wrong in your way, it's *your way*. \n\nHowever, you need to be conscious of when \"your way\" makes someone uncomfortable.

Honestly I just feel all sides need to apologize and move on.", "Nah everyone relax", "NAH. I also make jokes to cope with my mom\u2019s death but I don\u2019t blame him for being blindsided. I think it\u2019s a bit odd that it\u2019s never come up before this point.

Different strokes for different folks.", "Nta\u2026 dark humour. I\u2019d say the same if it was a usual thing I\u2019d say out of habit with others. But probably would have told him my mum was dead prior to this.", "NTA - I guess I understand how it may have been uncomfortable for him but I don\u2019t really understand how he got HIS feelings hurt over YOUR mom\u2019s death and frankly thats your business to talk about it if you choose to so I also don\u2019t feel like he gets to be upset that you didn\u2019t tell him. It sounds like you both just need to have a chat about it.", " NTA. But a few months of dating before you then effectively tell him she\u2019s dead?\n\nExplain the \u201cjoke\u201d you have (which I think is wonderful, btw, it\u2019s a healthy part of grieving) with friends and why it\u2019s that way. He probably hasn\u2019t ever lost anyone, let alone a parent so death will still be a morbid mystery to him.", "I would say no arsehole here, but he called you an arsehole, which makes him in arsehole. So NTA. \n\nI think your attitude with your mum, maintaining that \u2018hi mum\u2019 tradition, keeping it light hearted and whimsical is absolutely fantastic. Well done you, a lot of people would struggle to maintain such an upbeat mentality here. \n\nThe one thing I would be aware of though is a lot of people have different attitudes and relationships with the notion of death and I would say your lovely approach is in the minority. I can understand why he would have felt it was weird / jarring that you would announce something so major in such a jovial way. I think a lot of us would expect that information to come out in a heavy conversation, not passing through the living room and casually saying \u2018hey\u2019 to an urn. \n\nI think you need to have a chat with him, explain the whole context and whilst I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily warranted, I\u2019d maybe apologise for dropping the bombshell so casually.", "NAH I think he was caught off guard by this information, and it's not something he's encountered before. I've met people who've grieved in similar ways to this, and it seems to be about keeping the spirit of their loved ones alive. A conversation about how you *do* take it seriously might make him feel better, but ultimately its *your* grief and *your* family and that's something he has to understand.", "NTA but he\u2019s definitely not wrong in how he feels either. I get that it\u2019s a force of habit for you but I also think that the topic of parents, especially when you plan on bringing him to your home, should come up and if he\u2019s important enough to bring home, then he should also know something as important as your mother being dead.", "NTA - I\u2019m sure it was a shock for him, but he responded inappropriately. He had no right to insult you in your own home over his perceptions of how you mourn and remember your mother. He assumed the worst about you (laughing at your mom\u2019s death) instead of approaching this new situation with an open mind and willingness to understand.", "NAH it seems that the blindside was unintentional and that saying hi was semi joking. You weren\u2019t concerned whether he actually said hi to her urn. I also lost my mom and I have started making an occasional joke about it. Everyone deals with stuff differently.", "NTA - weird, yes. AH, nope. Up the ante: encourage him to \u2018rub mommies urn for luck, bae!\u2019", "NTA. If you were laughing about it (it's YOUR mom), I'd figure it wasn't that serious.", "YTA", "He wasn't in on the inside joke. And it involves death. And someone's earthly remains. What did you expect?\n\nNot sure if you know this but some people absolutely freak out in regard to death. Some people are not bothered by it at all. And all points in between.\n\nThis feels like a situation where someone makes a \"joke\" that is really just a nasty remark about some sort of people or other. No one laughs, some take offense and the offender declares \"no one can take a joke anymore!1!\". That's what this feels like. \n\nMaybe your NTA (imo the jury's out) but you really should consider developing your social skills.", "NAH\n\nWhile it is best to tell new people in your life about your mum being dead in a non jokey way, you didn't mean any harm to your boyfriend. He freaked out because a lot of people get freaked out about death and dead people.\n\nI'm guessing that your \"say hi to my mum\" was just something you say automatically when you enter your home?\n\nIf it was intentional, it's best not to do that with people new to your life. It's a good idea to say that she's dead and you tend to say hi to her urn when you enter your home.", "NTA. Everyone has their own beliefs, and I know a young woman that has seen spirits her entire life. If someone told me this, I'd look around the room and say hi to your mom. \n\nBut then, I don't believe in coincidences. I believe that if you feel that assured about telling people to say hi to your mom when they come into your home, it means your mom is still there. There may come a day when your Mom feels that peace and feels as if she is completed her unfinished business, and one day, you will find that you no longer feel the need to tell people to say hi to your mom. In those moments, it's also likely that she has moved on.\n\nNobody has a right to tell you how to grieve, and nobody has a right to tell you it's strange. You're not hurting anyone, it isn't detrimental to you, and in a lot of ways, in many different faiths, because you hold your mom's urn in the living room, she most certainly is still there.\n\nI would actually say that it's a red flag that he didn't respect your beliefs and started laughing at you because you asked him to say hi to your mom. If he's this early in the relationship and can't respect your values, then you need to find someone that does.\n\nAll he really did was show that he is not boyfriend material for you. All he did was show, already, that he is not going to respect your values, even when they're important to you and don't hurt anyone.", "Hmmm NAH. Finding out that your partner has lost a parent is actually quite big news, it\u2019s normally covered fairly early on. I think it\u2019s important to emotionally understand that they have had that loss. It\u2019s also important to know that before you go asking things like, what you getting your mum for mothers day this year (for example). My recent ex lost his dad when he was in his teens, he opened up about it a lot and it still affects him now and he has certain times of the year where he goes quiet, I know why because he told me and I can better support him at those times. I think it\u2019s great you can be lighthearted about it and that you have a little tradition but you did blindside him with what should probably have been shared in a different way and sounds like you weirded him out. He\u2019s maybe wondering why you \u201chid it\u201d from him too. Just talk it out together", "NAH, but you really need to work on your communication skills.", "YTA.\nMany here have pointed out why.", "YTA 100% - what a weird thing to spring on someone.", "NTA that\u2019s a weird thing to for your boyfriend to make a big deal out of.", "NTA, everyone grieves the way they do. Your behavior is part of your process. \n\nHe didn\u2019t have to Actually say anything to mom. He could have chose to walk on by and move on with the night. \n\nBut he made the entire situation about himself. It\u2019s your mother that died. It\u2019s your grieving process.

However, I fully understand that many people are quite uncomfortable with death in general, and everyone processes it differently.

You blindsided him and thought it was humorous, YTA.", "Not trying to justify the boyfriends reaction, but my first thought was- if he\u2019s got some unhealed pain in his own life (sick or dead relatives), it could have been jarring and a little triggering for him(?) \nOP said that they\u2019ve only been dating a few months and don\u2019t talk about family so much- it\u2019s possible that he\u2019s also been affected by the death of a loved one, and didn\u2019t choose to cope the way OP did. That\u2019s just a random assumption though, I know nothing \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. The fact that you have turned this trauma into something positive for you to cope is awesome, OP.\n\nI don't think you owe this dude any explanation. 3 months into a relationship, and this turned into an issue? Idk seems off?? He seems unempathetic and selfish for making you feel bad. \n\n(If someone doesn't get my dark humor / sarcasm, I know for a fact we wouldn't work)\n\nYou got this OP!", "NTA\n\nI can understand pretty well what you did there and (maybe it\u2019s because we have the same humor) I think he over reacted.  You weren\u2019t telling him to pity you, you were just making a joke.\n\nSome people just aren\u2019t going to be sympatico with your approach to the death of moms. I would say especially men but I have nothing but conjecture to base that on.  I would say that you should probably talk to partners about your moms death in the future before asking them to say hi or to at least vet your partners humour before dropping that bomb haha", "NAH. You didn't do anything wrong but his reaction is reasonable. I guess he was 1. At first very confused you brought him back to see your mum, thinking she was just sitting in the dark in your house.  2. Feeling confused. 3. Figured out she was dead and that was a big enough event for you to have her remains but to not tell him about. \n\nI guess it kinda depends how long you have been dating for but for me I normally go over my family however briefly fairly early on. You are also completely in the right for not wanting to discuss your dead mother on a date.\n\nJust a situation that was sort of weird for everyone. Give him a little space before revisiting it.", "NAH - No, it wasn't the best way to tell him about her death.  \n\nThere was nothing malicious in it.\n\nSome people wouldn't have had a problem with it, even if they found it disconcerting.  For others, possibly him, it'd be too much.", "personally i think NTA, i had a friend this summer ask if i wanted to meet her mom and i said yes and she took an urn out of her desk drawer. it was embarrassing for me for a moment but seeing how she laughed about it made me feel ok. it\u2019s how some people cope.", "don\u2019t listen to the people saying yta, You are not the asshole, no one here is. It\u2019s just two different ways of processing death. Communicate more and I\u2019m sure things will work out.", "NAH, I love this tradition. But I dont understand why you'd invite a guy you barely know to stay over at your home home. If he doesn't know your mom is in an urn then he barely knows you.", "I don't this is asshole behavior but I also don't think your boyfriend's reaction makes him the asshole. \n\nYou do have to realize, him not knowing your mom was dead and finding out how he did would be weird for a lot of people. Doesn't make him weird about death, but the moment is a little strange. I'm also sure he thought you were laughing at him, which didn't help things. But also, of course he would look around for your mom, you're the only one in this moment that knows where she is.\n\nAnyway, not the asshole, neither is your boyfriend, but I do think you're in the wrong to a degree, so I'm not putting in an actual ruling.", "This is such a non event, imo he's making a huge deal over nothing.", "That is weird as fuck. My entire family is dead and there's about a zero percent chance of me asking anyone to talk to any of them. \n\nI know it's hard, and it gets harder around the holidays, but let's not get carried away.", "If I was dating someone and I thought their parents were alive and then I was told otherwise, I'd feel sad and shocked, and I'd have to think about what I'm going to say. I'd want my first comment on it to be empathetic and a way to figure out how comfortable they are talking about it. You're laughing now, but how's he supposed to know if the wrong reaction will have you bursting into tears. Like maybe the joking is a coping mechanism that just barely gets you by. Or maybe you've accepted this, are able to live your life, and this just let's you think about your mother's humour and remember her positively. But how would he know if his reaction is supposed to be laughing along with you or walking on eggshells? He also hasn't heard anything about your mother until you're making morbid jokes. If someone's mother had died 9 months before I met them and they didn't mention it once in the three months after, I'd wonder if they're dealing with it well. If I hadn't seen any sadness or love or signs of grieving or mention of her, I'd wonder why the person I'm dating has completely ignored and hidden a big aspect of the last year of their life.\n\nAre you an asshole? That seems harsh. But I think this is a weird and inappropriate thing to say. You should have told him earlier. Or after he'd seen the urn, said something about her death and how you're dealing with it and then made your jokes. Once he knows how it's impacting you today and understands what he can and cannot say about/\"to\" her", "NTA \nPeople deal with a family member's death in different ways. Some prefer internment, others an urn in a wall, others get scattered over a favorite spot in nature, you chose an urn at home. \nIf you want to say hi to mum as you pass, go ahead. Your sqeaky new boyfriend should be taking his behaviour cues from you - nothing more, nothing less. If you are okay with mum perched there, its none of his business to say otherwise.", "I think he overreacted", "NTA he's a child.", "Soft YTA, death for many is a very sensitive subject. I think some warning in advance would have been best.", "Haha See that\u2019s the humor she used . \nIt is not insulting to the Mom \nEverything doesn\u2019t have to be serious and bleak around death .

How could this be anything other than YTA?", "This is such a bad take.\n\nIt\u2019s such a non event.\n\nHe could have easily just responded with \u201coh ok. Hi mum\u201d. \n\nThe only AH here is the bf.", "i wasn\u2019t trying to make him apart of it, it was truly force of habit as i don\u2019t invite many people who aren\u2019t my friends over. i don\u2019t even talk to her, i just say hey as im walking by as i did when she was alive. if someone doesn\u2019t want to do it that\u2019s their choice, i just didn\u2019t feel like his reaction was entirely warranted.", "Omg you\u2019re insensitive AH", "If a guy I barely know laughingly told me to say hi to his dead mother's urn, without having first told me she has passed and that they were actually keeping her in the house, I would be creeped out of my mind and would carefully plan my exit.\n\nSo yeah he was an AH for calling OP an AH but what did she expect?", "Agee", "Totally agree. It\u2019s a sweet tradition. It\u2019s understandable that someone might be a bit taken aback, but to say OP is an AH is not fair.", "Totally agree. He's making her mom's death about him. Nobody should tell others how to grieve. If she wants to use dark humor for her own mom, she can!", "If someone is sad enough to end a relationship over that they never deserved the other person anyway.\n\nImagine ending a relationship because your partner said \"say hi to my mom\" and laughed when you didn't notice the urn. Pathetic", "Nonsense, this is in nowhere big enough to end a relationship. Grow up.", "I agree - I feel like all of the Y T A judgements here fail to recognise that a parent's death is nobody's business but the children involved. It's perfectly reasonable for this not to come up in conversation, and OP has no obligation to give all the details to their boyfriend of only a few months. Sure, it's normal to ask about your partner's parents while dating, but it's not the be-all and end-all of all relationships. \n\nI understand that he's upset you didn't tell him, OP, but at the same time his response was totally disproportionate. How is the way you choose to handle YOUR mother's death insulting to him? Sounds like he needs to touch some grass, honestly. A more appropriate response from him would have been to ask further if he was so curious, or try to awkwardly console you in some way if he wasn't into the tradition of greeting your mom. \n\nDumbest thing in the world to get so deeply offended by. NTA all the way. \n\n(Also, if a partner takes themselves so seriously that they can't handle being laughed at after a silly scenario, they should probably reassess their readiness for any kind of romantic or intimate relationship.)", "i try to stay upbeat and whimsical as that\u2019s how she was in live so thank you for the kind words, i\u2019ll likely consider apologizing if he ever responds to my texts. \n\ni\u2019ve never really experienced death in my family before so this has been my only way of learning and realizing how others feel around it. i\u2019m finding out a lot of opinions for sure.", "OP presented boyfriend with a *dead person* and then made fun of their response.\n\nHow is THAT not inappropriate?", "i\u2019d truly never laugh at her death or even make jokes(and i have a dark sense of humor) her death devastated me and my family for months and really what kept me going was my friends and us still acting like we did before so i now can understand it\u2019s jarring but his reaction really hurt my feelings.", "Absolutely, I don't see what OP has to apologise for. I guess it's a little unusual how he'd never brought it up earlier, but the boyfriend is super weird for making this all about himself and turning it into a whole thing. Just laugh it off ffs, sometimes people just forget to mention big things.", ">but you really should consider developing your social skills.\n\nI don't know, it just seems like a genuine brain fart. He forgot to mention his mother's death, the inside joke and then laughed because he realised what had happened. It could happen to anyone.

It is *not* anyone's place to tell you how to grieve and deal. \n\nI'd apologize to him, but just tell him it wasn't a joke, this is just how you are with people you care about.

Death and grief were a part of my life in a normal way from a fairly young age, which is actually not so common. You learn how to cope because it\u2019s that or be miserable. I had to be told my casualness with talking about my dad\u2019s death freaked people out.

You blindsided him. He wasn\u2019t cool with it. Some people are not comfortable with death or joking about it. You made him extremely uncomfortable and now you\u2019re making it his fault that he was uncomfortable and reacted badly?  I mean, it\u2019s not like he screamed at you or got physical or something. He called you AH.

With that considered, how can you expect him to react to your laughing? He surely wouldn't expect that you're laughing at him for looking for someone he didn't even know was dead, so his mind probably went elsewhere and thought you were laughing at his discomfort or making a weird joke at his expense.", "You don't see why *death* makes some people uncomfortable? Really? I kinda doubt that. \n\nLook, you clearly cope using gallows humour. I get that, and it's valid. I do the same thing. But not everyone does, and some would find your way of coping downright offensive if applied to their *own* dead relatives. You maybe need to be a little more aware of that in future. There are people who are *not* okay with finding out your mother is dead by you walking past an urn and going \"Say hi to my mom!\" \n\nLet alone you then laughing - which he probably perceived as you laughing *at him*. And honestly, I don't know if he's far from the mark given that in the post, you said you laughed because \"I thought it was silly he actually looked around for her\" (btw nice job trying to paint that in the comments as \"I laughed because I was confused\" - that's not what your post says, your post says you were laughing *at his totally normal reaction*).\n\nI feel like solving this is as simple as sitting him down and explaining.

I would have thought that would have come up!), but for laughing when her boyfriend looked round for her mom. \n\nThat should have been a \"whoops, sorry, I can't believe this didn't come up\" moment, not a moment for laughing because he looked silly.
