As we passed by it i say \u2018say hi to my mom\u2019 by force of habit since its a thing with my friends where when they\u2019d come over they\u2019d either find my mom to say hi or i\u2019d go \u2018say hi to my mom\u2019. And that didn\u2019t stop after she died, it just stuck and they\u2019d go \u2018hey OP\u2019s mom!\u2019. \n\nSo i say that to him and he stops walking and looks around, we\u2019re completely home alone and the living room doesn\u2019t have the lights on so he doesn\u2019t see her urn immediately. I laugh and point to the urn and just start walking again but he stops me and looks at me with a half concerned half annoyed expression? i ask what\u2019s wrong and he annoyedly asks \u2018why would you tell me to say hi to her, why wouldn\u2019t you tell me she\u2019s dead before this?\u2019 and i was puzzled. \n\nthe topic of her death never came up in the last few months of us dating, plus we\u2019d only known each other for a few months before dating and never got super close. So i didn\u2019t think of mentioning it and i didn\u2019t think it was a big deal so i told him that. he said im an asshole for springing my moms death on him then laughing about it\u2026 i only chuckled because i thought it was silly he actually looked around for her, i wasn\u2019t laughing at her death?? \n\ni don\u2019t know if im the asshole but maybe it wasn\u2019t the best way to tell him about her death?? but if the lights were on he absolutely would\u2019ve seen the urn has its decorated and had fairy lights that we turn on at night. so i think since he was supposed to spend the night he would\u2019ve seen it when he got up for water or something. he didn\u2019t end up spending the night and left shortly after, this was yesterday and he texted me good morning today but hasn\u2019t texted otherwise. AITA?\n\nUPDATE: jesus christ. this has gotten WAY more attention than i thought it would. let me clarify a few things. \n\nanother clarification since everyone is assuming i invited him over for sex. the \u2018spend the night\u2019 request was not based sexually, i\u2019m home alone for two days due to other familial reasons and im a generally anxious guy so i wanted someone home with me. and my friends are out of town for holidays so i invited my boyfriend over since he doesnt celebrate christmas and had no plans. \n\n1. I am NOT expecting him or anyone else who comes into my house to say hi to her, ffs even my own siblings don\u2019t do this it\u2019s literally just something between me and my friends. \n\n2. when i said \u2018i laughed because i thought it was silly he looked for her\u2019 i didn\u2019t mean i thought it was funny, i guess my wording was just off. i thought since we were about four feet from the urn he\u2019d see it in his peripheral view. and another thing is people think i was mad about his reaction\u2026 i wasn\u2019t i was just confused. \n\n3. fyi im a guy i have no idea why everyone thinks im a girl despite the fact ive had 20m in the first few lines of the post since i posted it last night. and also being gay has nothing to do with this, in our area nearly everyone is accepting of lgbt+ so it\u2019s assumed our parents are as well. so therefore the topic of parents/family accepting hasn\u2019t come up. i\u2019ve yet to meet his parents as well. \n\n4. and when i say \u2018certain topics never come up\u2019 i mean it. i\u2019m sure the other comment i made is buried by now but my mom was the first death i\u2019ve ever experienced in my family(sounds strange i know, my family isn\u2019t big and really the only people who have died did so when i was >5 so it\u2019s not in my memory) and i don\u2019t really talk about my family life all that much to anyone. not because im hiding it i just rather focus on other topics. even one of my closest friends didn\u2019t know about my mom remarrying until i posted about getting a suit for it.

If you wanted to make him part of the ritual you needed to tell him she's dead before inviting him over and how you and your friends still talk to her and based on his reaction to that you could ask if he wants to meet her. Not everyone talks to dead loved ones so asking him to talk to a dead stranger was assuming a lot.", "NAH. It\u2019s weird that he would call you an AH over that. I can understand him being taken aback, but calling you an AH is disproportionate", "NAH. I think your tradition is sweet, I can also see why your boyfriend would be blindsided by the situation as it happened. \n\nI do feel it would've been good to mention the situation bforehand, but people deal with grief in different ways so its understandable why you didn't bring it up.\n\nI think its worth to have a honest conversation about the situation and give some acknowledgement of your bfs feelings.

When did it happen?'\n'Last year - its all cool now. Was just something of habit we say!'\n\nI would have then said hello each time. Its quirky and fun. Why get angry about shit like that? Honestly - would make me question his responses to major events he would actually be involved in!", "NAH. It\u2019s something that you\u2019ve normalized and so it isn\u2019t a big deal for you. He may have never been around someone\u2019s ashes before and losing loved ones affects us all differently. You two just have different experiences that shaped your  reactions to what happened last night. \n\nWhen I was around 16-17, I was hanging out with my best friend and she took me to the house of someone she was friends with. When I sat down in his living room he plopped an urn on my lap and introduced me to his father. I definitely had a brief WTF moment. \n\nI would imagine going to someone\u2019s house to spend the night for the first time and having the surprise introduction to your mom\u2019s ashes was probably a bit of a mood killer.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t like you demanded/forced him to say hi to her. you just said it out of habit as it\u2019s kind of a little joke between you and your friends. he isn\u2019t owed a sit down where you explain to him your mum\u2019s dead. you can tell him however and whenever you want. and it doesn\u2019t even sound like you intended to tell him anything at that moment, which is 100% fine. he shouldn\u2019t get annoyed with you for that\u2014it\u2019s weird behaviour to think you\u2019re entitled to someone telling you about their dead parent when you\u2019ve only known them a few months and aren\u2019t that close. \n\nalso im a bit confused on this part, but i\u2019ll just say if he\u2019s getting annoyed that you laughed about her death then he\u2019s being ridiculous. it\u2019s your grief to laugh about and joke about how you want.", "NAH.\n\nThis is completely normal to you, so it\u2018s understandable that you didn\u2018t think much of it. Likewise, it\u2018s understandable that being told about your mother\u2018s death in this way was weird for your boyfriend.", "YTA. Good way to end a relationship. You know all the context and what makes this \"funny.\" He doesn't.", "NAH, death is difficult for people, you should have given him a heads up, his reaction was very harsh I'd say.", "NAH death is a topic that people approach differently.", "YTA\u2026you blindsided him with a \u201ctradition\u201d you had never explained, then laughed at his confusion. How would you not be the asshole here?

You aren't wrong in your way, it's *your way*. \n\nHowever, you need to be conscious of when \"your way\" makes someone uncomfortable.

Honestly I just feel all sides need to apologize and move on.", "Nah everyone relax", "NAH. I also make jokes to cope with my mom\u2019s death but I don\u2019t blame him for being blindsided.

It sounds like you both just need to have a chat about it.", " NTA. But a few months of dating before you then effectively tell him she\u2019s dead?\n\nExplain the \u201cjoke\u201d you have (which I think is wonderful, btw, it\u2019s a healthy part of grieving) with friends and why it\u2019s that way. He probably hasn\u2019t ever lost anyone, let alone a parent so death will still be a morbid mystery to him.", "I would say no arsehole here, but he called you an arsehole, which makes him in arsehole. So NTA. \n\nI think your attitude with your mum, maintaining that \u2018hi mum\u2019 tradition, keeping it light hearted and whimsical is absolutely fantastic. Well done you, a lot of people would struggle to maintain such an upbeat mentality here. \n\nThe one thing I would be aware of though is a lot of people have different attitudes and relationships with the notion of death and I would say your lovely approach is in the minority. I can understand why he would have felt it was weird / jarring that you would announce something so major in such a jovial way. I think a lot of us would expect that information to come out in a heavy conversation, not passing through the living room and casually saying \u2018hey\u2019 to an urn. \n\nI think you need to have a chat with him, explain the whole context and whilst I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily warranted, I\u2019d maybe apologise for dropping the bombshell so casually.", "NAH I think he was caught off guard by this information, and it's not something he's encountered before. I've met people who've grieved in similar ways to this, and it seems to be about keeping the spirit of their loved ones alive. A conversation about how you *do* take it seriously might make him feel better, but ultimately its *your* grief and *your* family and that's something he has to understand.", "NTA but he\u2019s definitely not wrong in how he feels either. I get that it\u2019s a force of habit for you but I also think that the topic of parents, especially when you plan on bringing him to your home, should come up and if he\u2019s important enough to bring home, then he should also know something as important as your mother being dead.", "NTA - I\u2019m sure it was a shock for him, but he responded inappropriately. He had no right to insult you in your own home over his perceptions of how you mourn and remember your mother. He assumed the worst about you (laughing at your mom\u2019s death) instead of approaching this new situation with an open mind and willingness to understand.", "NAH it seems that the blindside was unintentional and that saying hi was semi joking. You weren\u2019t concerned whether he actually said hi to her urn. I also lost my mom and I have started making an occasional joke about it. Everyone deals with stuff differently.", "NTA - weird, yes. AH, nope. Up the ante: encourage him to \u2018rub mommies urn for luck, bae!\u2019", "NTA. If you were laughing about it (it's YOUR mom), I'd figure it wasn't that serious.", "YTA", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nWhile it is best to tell new people in your life about your mum being dead in a non jokey way, you didn't mean any harm to your boyfriend. He freaked out because a lot of people get freaked out about death and dead people.\n\nI'm guessing that your \"say hi to my mum\" was just something you say automatically when you enter your home?\n\nIf it was intentional, it's best not to do that with people new to your life. It's a good idea to say that she's dead and you tend to say hi to her urn when you enter your home.", "NTA. Everyone has their own beliefs, and I know a young woman that has seen spirits her entire life. If someone told me this, I'd look around the room and say hi to your mom. \n\nBut then, I don't believe in coincidences. I believe that if you feel that assured about telling people to say hi to your mom when they come into your home, it means your mom is still there. There may come a day when your Mom feels that peace and feels as if she is completed her unfinished business, and one day, you will find that you no longer feel the need to tell people to say hi to your mom. In those moments, it's also likely that she has moved on.\n\nNobody has a right to tell you how to grieve, and nobody has a right to tell you it's strange. You're not hurting anyone, it isn't detrimental to you, and in a lot of ways, in many different faiths, because you hold your mom's urn in the living room, she most certainly is still there.\n\nI would actually say that it's a red flag that he didn't respect your beliefs and started laughing at you because you asked him to say hi to your mom. If he's this early in the relationship and can't respect your values, then you need to find someone that does.\n\nAll he really did was show that he is not boyfriend material for you. All he did was show, already, that he is not going to respect your values, even when they're important to you and don't hurt anyone.", "Hmmm NAH. Finding out that your partner has lost a parent is actually quite big news, it\u2019s normally covered fairly early on. I think it\u2019s important to emotionally understand that they have had that loss. It\u2019s also important to know that before you go asking things like, what you getting your mum for mothers day this year (for example). My recent ex lost his dad when he was in his teens, he opened up about it a lot and it still affects him now and he has certain times of the year where he goes quiet, I know why because he told me and I can better support him at those times. I think it\u2019s great you can be lighthearted about it and that you have a little tradition but you did blindside him with what should probably have been shared in a different way and sounds like you weirded him out.

No way you didn\u2019t unlearn \u201csay hi to my mom\u201d when she died. I\u2019m calling bullshit. You thought it would be cute and funny and your boyfriend, instead, found it bizarre and off-putting. Relationship is probably dead in the water.", "Yta.  Thats super weird.  I would have felt very uncomfortable. It may seem normal to you but this was a very strange thing to introduce to a new person.  He didn\u2019t know her and then you ask him to say hi to her urn.  That would really put me on edge", "YTA. \n\nYour friends, it\u2019s tradition. They get it. But you didn\u2019t mention you\u2019d lost your mum at any other point, so for me that would come across as extremely creepy, especially with the laughing.", "YTA", "Yeah that\u2019s kinda weird and comes across strange that you laughed too. It would have bothered me to and made me uncomfortable also. Soft YTA.", "YTA but not a big one. When death happens often we evolve into a sense of macabre humor about it. I have done it myself. It's not thoughtful to someone who's position / intention is to specifically become close to you and eventually a safe space. You are essentially saying \"hey I want you to become my safe space but I'm gonna evade like mad and laugh at your consternation\"  \n\nI'm sure that's not your predominant objective, but it's folded in there. And it can hurt the people who are tasked with being your confidant.", "Soft YTA. No it wasn\u2019t the best way to tell him. I\u2019m all for some dark humor and engage with it myself, but he didn\u2019t even know about her death. That\u2019s a very jarring way to hear about a death of a loved one close to your partner. I do not think you\u2019re an AH for laughing about it though. That\u2019s just him not understanding how you\u2019ve coped.", "NAH death affects everyone in different ways and everyone has different comfort levels when talking about death and the dead. You saying hi to your mums urn is a part of your healing process, you involving your friends in this process is your normal. That doesn\u2019t mean it has to be normal to him. I can understand why he found it a bit confronting, especially if he didn\u2019t know she had passed.", "NAH.\n\nYou've accepted your mother has passed and have found your own ways of coping. You included him, and while he didn't expect it, it isn't like you broke the news to him that his mother just died by using a joke. This is your relationship with your parent and he can't really tell you what is or isn't okay as far as how you handle it.\n\nI would apologize for springing the topic on him that way, but explain that you've embraced her passing and her presence in the home and that you cope by making that comment with friends.", "NAH. I do think it makes sense he was weirded out since you hadn't told him your mom is dead, but that level of offense is interesting. I think having a longer conversation about this would be helpful. how ppl cope with grief and death is incredibly personal and I don't think everyone has to be incredibly serious about it all the time. as someone with a dead parent, I also make offhand comments or jokes about it sometimes.", "YTA. Not a great way to have all of that come up.  He likely wouldn\u2019t have noticed the urn until much later and you could have given him the full story in a more appropriate way.  Over time he would have likely called in line with how you approach it and no big deal. \n\nI think you need to apologize to him and ask for a do over.  Tell him you failed to get it wasn\u2019t appropriate because you do it daily and didn\u2019t stop to think about how it was presented to him.  Tell him you care alot about him and would ask that you try again.", "Very soft YTA for me. I understand the dark humor but not everyone reacts the same way to death, so, especially not knowing that much about his family, you shouldn't let him know beforehand. However his reaction was completely out of proportion. \n\nSo yeah I'm somewhere between soft YTA and NAH", "YTA, but only because you didn't ask why he had a reaction like that (unless you just didn't mention it in your post). There may be some huge unresolved trauma in his own life, that at three months didn't come to the surface yet. If you want to continue to see him, you may need to apologize, ask questions, and be prepared to listen to what he has to say.", "NTA but you\u2019re a weirdo,", "As a person whose mom died when I was young, I personally feel like this is a soft YTA. I also use a lot of humor to cope with the situation, too, but it can be really jarring to learn about a partner\u2019s parent\u2019s death this way. I think that if he already knew, and then you did this, it would be totally fine, but this was probably uncomfortable for him.", "YTA. Geez", "You\u2019ve been dating for three months.  Your mom died a year ago. You haven\u2019t mentioned it yet? It\u2019s one of the most major events ina person\u2019s life, it just happened, and it hasn\u2019t come up in any conversation yet? \n\nThat would freak me out too. I would radically reassess how well I knew my GF if I didn\u2019t know that massive recent fact after three months. I\u2019m trying to step into his shoes, and it\u2019s weird to not know that about a GF after three months.", "YTAH, basically you blindsided him with your dead mother's urn, then laughing at him for his reaction.  YTAH.", "Yta it's a basic thing that you should have told him. Also it might be normal for you to say hi to an urn or ashes but you can't expect them at from anyone else.", "YTA and this is a MAJOR red flag to him. He will leave you.", "Yeah, YTA. You should\u2019ve warned him that she was dead if you expected him to say hi to her when you walked into your place. Really weird information to leave out if you expected him to greet her. \n\nJust something to keep in mind for the future. I think it\u2019s harmless, and I don\u2019t have a problem with it, BECAUSE you explain it to me.

I believe our bodies and all that remain of them are nothing without the soul and consciousness that make up who we are. I don\u2019t get the morbid fascination with remains. Leaving all that aside, I don\u2019t think you handled telling your friend about your departed mother very well. You guys are getting ready to go to bed and you wave and say hello to an urn??? It\u2019s odd to say the least.", "YTA. You ostensibly met this person 6 months or so after your mom died. You have been dating for months. The subject of family hasn't come up? At all? That's strange to me. \n\nWhat's even more strange is that this is how you tell someone your mom is dead. I get why he is weird about it. I would be too.", "YTA a lot of people don't initially know my mom is dead. But if it's someone I'm friends with and been dating for multiple months, and knew prior to dating them or getting serious, that would absolutely have come up in conversation. Or this is not a serious relationship and this person is a fuck buddy and not a boyfriend.", "YTA and you could use some counseling to help you move forward with your life.  It is ok to mourn for your mother but what you are doing is not good.", "So you knew him for at least a few months before dating, now dating 3 months. So safe bet you\u2019ve known him 6+ months. Weird that the topic of your *mother\u2019s* death never came up in all that time, but okay, could happen. \n\nYTA for not bringing this up before he came over though, given that your mother\u2019s remains are in the house and that you have this ritual of greeting her when you pass by. The ritual is sweet, but your reaction to your boyfriend\u2019s surprise and shock is what puts you in AH territory. Springing the news on him and laughing at his reaction puts you in AH territory. \n\nI bet the poor guy is right now wondering what other major details you haven\u2019t told him and might spring on him at any moment.", "You are kind of the asshole because after three months, your boyfriend should know if your mom is dead. It\u2019s kinda funny tho about the urn so\u2026", "YTA.\nJesus. ask him why.", "Yea You're the asshole. Dude was importnt enough to bring home to meeting your surviving family, he's important enough to share the fact that you lost a parent.", "Yes you\u2019re the asshole and you\u2019re pretty weird for doing that to him.", "I would say a soft YTA. Some people cope with death by thinking of the urn as a symbol of their loved ones soul. Other people become uncomfortable talking about the topic of death if they\u2019ve had a loved one pass because they\u2019re not sure how to react to it. He should have reacted better to that but perhaps take in mind some people find death uncomfortable because they\u2019re not sure how to act around. He may have just been caught off guard because it is a little strange to say that but obviously you and your friends/family are happy with saying hello to your mum which is honestly fantastic (I\u2019ve not known anyone to do that but I like the idea of keeping your mums memory alive). Honestly, considering how you\u2019ve only been together and considering how this does sound like a big part of your routine I\u2019d suggest finding a man who can understand and take it upon himself to say hello to your mum. Some people would be more than happy to, others would find it weird.  Ultimately, it would depend on how much it really means to you personally for your partner to greet your mum too! \ud83d\ude0a", "Do you like LIKE this bf? If so, STOP IT. It's a very weird thing to ask someone to do, ESPECIALLY when that person never met your mother. I think yes, YTA.", "Nta. You have a great sense of humor and either he has to get used to it or move on. I would have chuckled and said hello or something like that and then asked about her. It's a way of remembrance and acknowledgement and I think healthy acceptance. Enjoy life, be less serious when you can be. You'll live longer and happier. Do well.", "NTA, and the other judgements you're receiving are really confusing to me. This doesn't feel offensive at all- its YOUR Mom and however you deal with her passing is fine. You didn't coerce him into a seance or something. He seems really uptight and maybe not a great fit for you in the long run, if he's going to make this a whole thing.", "YTA. Why would you make your friends seek her out and say hi even when she was alive? Let them greet her naturally. Plus asking people to say hi to an urn is creepy AF", "YTA\n\nIf you have your own way of dealing with your mom\u2019s death, fine.\n\nBut to imagine for a moment that\u2019s the right way to break it to your new bf that your mom is dead\u2026\n\nAnd then to laugh at him when he is understandably confused?  Total AH move.", "YTA. Your mother had never come up in conversation before? How? How can you be in a relationship with someone and not share that?", "As someone with a dead parent, very soft YTA. My dad is dead and of course I\u2019m used to that, but I know that not everyone has experienced a close death like that and are not as comfortable with death in general. When my boyfriend and I were about a month into dating, and we were talking about meeting each other\u2019s parents, I had a very brief but serious conversation explaining to him that my dad was dead. We didn\u2019t linger on the topic, he asked only a handful of questions that I answered, and then that was that. \n\nNow, I can crack a joke here and there and he will laugh (and I tell him he\u2019s allowed to laugh haha), but it\u2019s all because he wasn\u2019t blind sighted by the news. I know what it\u2019s like to be in your shoes and that it\u2019s weird to think about apologizing to someone for how you told them about your mom\u2019s death, but you really should apologize. You put him in an uncomfortable situation because 1) he doesn\u2019t know about the running joke you have with your friends and 2) he didn\u2019t even know your mom was dead. For people like us (lost a loved one very close to us), we are more accustomed to death, but for people who haven\u2019t lost a loved one that close to them before, they are still \u201cuncomfortable\u201d (I use that word because I couldn\u2019t think of a better word) with death and jokes about a dead loved one.", "YTA\n\nI'm sorry for your loss but regardless of how you told him about your mother, asking anyone to say hi to the urn of your mother's ashes is creepy af.", "I've asked every bf I've had since my mommoms passing say hello to her. I mean beforehand they know she's dead and how much she meant to me and she is in the living room which is hard to avoid so when I eventually bring them over to hang out and we are in the living room I'll put my hand on her urn (I do this a lot in passing anyway) and go \"that's 'bf name'. He's a  sweet guy!\" Or something else positive about them and then say \"you can say hi if you'd like\" I leave it up to them and everyone of them has said hi! One even said bye to her when leaving and that really touched me\ud83e\ude77. Point is NTA sure people deal with death in different ways but I'm sure the death of your mom is harder on you than some guy who might have been a little uncomfortable but if he cared enough he'd recognize that and would just move past this.", "Boyfriend knows Reddit handle.

Especially if you've already normalised it with yourself and your friend group. \n\nThat said, I do also understand why your bf would be blindsided by it. Again, not everyone deals with these sorts of things the same way, so something that's normal to you might not be normal to him, and that's okay. I do think he overreacted calling you an AH for it, but still. \n\nI'd probably just sit down with him and explain properly, apologise for blindsiding him with it, and make sure he understands you don't EXPECT him to do that, it's just a force of habit.

There\u2019s an extent it is not healthy, if you\u2019re constantly doing so every moment of the day per say.  But when confronted with a reminder, such as an urn with the literal body in it, it\u2019s hard not to avoid the thought.  My family is one to make a joke, and laugh about it and reminisce.  We will cry, but we know it\u2019s best to be happy because that\u2019s what my father would want for us.  I also wanna add a very important note, and say that this means you aren\u2019t fit for each other in this sense at least.  Maybe, in other ways it works.  But this may cause issues in future if he\u2019s not willing to adapt and understand your humour levels.  If not, move on.  But if it works out, and doesn\u2019t cause consistent issues?

While we were getting to know each other and talking about our families, of course I mentioned that my dad had passed. It was still a hard topic for me, some times I could talk about it without getting upset and sometimes I couldnt, so I also let my new BF know about that, so he could be prepared if my dad was ever brought up in topic and I started to get really upset. \nI feel like OP could have mentioned his mom before now and warned the BF before he came to his house that he has this ritual.", "Maybe he\u2019s delusional for not thinking that informing his guest in a respectful way \u201cbtw, my mom passed away and I have her urn in my house.

Learning about this while visiting OPs family home for the first time also seems to be an appropriate moment for OPs boyfriend, since (again) they have only been dating for a few months and OP has absolutely no obligation to disclose personal information of this nature if they don't think it's relevant or necessary in the moment.
