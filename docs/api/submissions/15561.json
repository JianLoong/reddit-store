It's something they are always very open about and will bring up to any expectant mother they know, sometimes even ones they don't know. It's normally in the unsolicited advice category but sometimes can be intrusive. I only breastfed my oldest, my son. I was 26 when I had him and really hadn't decided. But between my husband's family members assuming and not listening when he told them it wasn't a sure thing, and a nurse in the hospital I delivered at telling me I wouldn't need a bottle or anything else because I would be breastfeeding as it was their policy, I felt a lot of pressure to do it. I BF'd him for more than a year and I did not enjoy it at all. I had to wear a nipple shield, he would only feed in a certain position, my supply had some bad moments and overall I felt like a walking cow. There was no nice bonding moments when I was BFing. I hated whenever it was time for him to feed. My husband told me it was okay to switch to formula if I wanted, but I heard so many negatives about formula I feared being judged harshly. I even tried pumping but it was too uncomfortable for not enough reward.\n\nAfter BFing my son I formula fed two daughters and will formula feed my son I am currently expecting. My husband was a pro at telling his family to mind their own business when they didn't like that I didn't breastfeed again.\n\nMy husband's youngest sister is 23 and now expecting her first baby. She came to me and asked about my decision not to breastfeed my girls and said she didn't have anyone else to turn to about it because her family were telling her she was breastfeeding. But she wasn't sure about it for her (SIL had some mental health trouble over the years and her breasts were a source of discomfort for her and have some issues today).  I told her my decision was made because I hated breastfeeding when I had my first, how miserable I was and how it just was not good for my mental health. I told her that I never got the amazing moments of bonding that so many talk about. I told her I don't doubt that they happen, for others, but it's not everyone. She was nodding along and I reassured her that she does not need to do it if she's not comfortable and her mental health is more important.\n\nMy MIL and three other SILs are all extremely unhappy with me for my honesty with her and they told me I should not discourage a FTM from breastfeeding. I told them they shouldn't tell people what to do. They should be supporting her through this. That surely they can see why she feels as she does given she has requested to remain dressed when she has her baby (at least she wants to cover her chest at all costs and has been open about that).

And that the real thing is no one prepared her for the reality of a sick child, or just having a child. She told me an age appropriate version of my birth story, and she's always said if I was her first birth she'd have never had another because it was terrifying. My aunt had the opposite experience and wanted more but her post partum depression was so bad she couldn't do that to the children she already had. \n\nI was 14 when I saw Scrubs and JD says, \"You'll fart, pee, puke and poop in front of 12 people staring intensely at your vagina!\" And almost 15 years later I still cannot deal with the personal embarrassment factor of that. \n\nI love kids. I do not like frequent changes, or plans being disrupted, or having to tone down my swearing, drinking, having \"adult\" 24/7 for them.

I breastfed both of my children, but it comes with a major caveat: I was lucky enough to have no supply or latching issues and also fortunate enough to have the time and support to do it without compromising my own physical or mental health. I cannot emphasize enough that this is not a universal experience and *that is perfectly okay*. And to be clear: I consider just *not wanting* to breastfeed, but doing it anyways, as detrimental to one's mental health. Even when everything is textbook ideal, breastfeeding a baby is a lot of work at a time when you are probably the most exhausted you've ever been in your entire life... forcing yourself to do it when you don't really want to *has to be hell* and is 100% a valid detriment to mental health.

She tried so hard to breastfeed with their first, but never produced enough and had to formula feed.

The stress and devastation she felt was almost tragic to watch and it didn't help that our shared in-laws drew a lot of comparisons, as we both had newborns around the same time and breastfeeding was honestly unfairly easy for me. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe lived nearby each other and would sometimes take the babies out for walks in their strollers around the neighbourhood together and I remembered one day she rolled up to head out. I had been agonizing over whether or not I should \"overstep\" and address this elephant in the room between just us, even though I had been making sure to shut down the in-laws shitty attitudes about it... but the dynamic was made so weird that I felt like I couldn't talk to her about it without making her feel shamed by me, too. I was also acutely aware that I did not understand her struggle and the last thing I wanted to do was come off as patronizing. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis one day, she just looked so fucking exhausted and defeated, so I decided \"fuck it\" and brought it up because I was genuinely becoming really worried about her! We talked about it a lot that day... and I wish I had brought it up much sooner because, holy shit, is this ever something that expectant/new mothers *should* talk about! I'd been so afraid to bring it up and make her feel worse, she'd been afraid to bring it up and potentially get judged... what a waste of time and emotional energy when we could have just been supporting each other, even if our experiences were different. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe all know, all too well, that people who are judgemental about this stuff have *no problem* being loud about it to *everyone* without concern for how it makes others feel. So the counterbalance here is for people with a more fair perspective on it, and who actually care about the real humans they're speaking to and about, to be *equally vocal*. Ever since then, I have made it a point to be obnoxiously \"fed is best\" to any expectant parents I know or anyone who ever brings the topic up around me. What a fuckin load of bullshit that anyone feels they can add even more stress to someone going through pregnancy/childbirth/caring for a newborn over something that could not fuckin matter less.

If the baby is loved, cared for and healthy, it absolutely does not fuckin matter how they are fed, as long as they *are* fed. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis got long because I could go on about this all day, it burns my ass so much.

I BF my second for less than 5 months.  I BF my last child until she was 3 and some change.  As in 3 years.  I supplemented with all of the kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBF is challenging and fed is best - be it breast or bottle, breast or formula.  My last one had a heart defect and they tried (funny enough) not to BF my youngest one at all - I told them no, I did my research and BF would help with immunities (open heart surgery would cause her immune system to be compromised) - she would need it with having open heart surgery, etc.  Well, my post-op provider had lost a baby due to BF alone.  She actually tried to shame me for wanting to try BF and made me do a lactation consult where I was advised against it.  I told them no, I would be BF and I would be willing to supplement (and add extra formula) to beef up the calories my youngest needed. I had to agree to let a homecare nurse come in 3 times a week for several months.  The nurse came just 1 week and the 2nd visit in the second week and said, you got this and asked we be discharged from the visits because my youngest was not suffering from failure to thrive and in fact as soon as we got home, she picked up the first lb she had since her birth.  She had gone negative during her hospitalizations - as I had not BF her during that time.  I had had several emergency surgeries and complications myself.    I took my time getting better and building up a supply and when she came home, I was able to nurse on demand without all the medical devices, beeps and \"interventions\".    She ate well with both formula and Breast and she is now a healthy and happy 11-year-old.\n\nThe point - everyone has opinions - some people have strong ones shaped by their own experiences.  That does not make them experts, nor does it give them the right to try and take a choice away from individual women.  No 2 women, babies or situations are the same.  There are personal biases that go into raising children - starting with food and diapers.  A fed baby is a healthy baby - does not matter how they get the nourishment.  so long as they are thriving and growing - that is all that matters.  The benefits of BM wane after their 5 birthday - by graduation - there are not real big differences in kids and their IQ nor health that make one way any better than another.  Every woman needs to figure out what works best for her, her child and her family.  No one should be pressured into doing something they don't want to do if it has no real benefit or consequence for a child's health or wellbeing.\n\nBF or formula or any combo is great.  You gave your sil the advice she was looking for and that is helpful to her in weighing her options.  You will not be the first formula feeding mama to tell her to do her.  I loved BF but I know plenty who hated it.  How you bond with your child is up to you - Bonds come in all kinds of ways.  Feeding is not the only way.  Reading to a child, talking to a child and giving them physical comfort and interaction in any form can do the same as BF - it stimulates the child and makes them feel loved and cared for.  That is the goal, some people lose track of that.  Which is sad - mom's with babies need all the help and love they can get and being an ass about how they are fed only hurts that bond/situation.  People really do need to stay in their own lanes if all they have to add to a situation is drama or negativity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of my favorite videos I watched after my last bugger was born which sums it up rather nicely. . .
