It's something they are always very open about and will bring up to any expectant mother they know, sometimes even ones they don't know. It's normally in the unsolicited advice category but sometimes can be intrusive. I only breastfed my oldest, my son. I was 26 when I had him and really hadn't decided. But between my husband's family members assuming and not listening when he told them it wasn't a sure thing, and a nurse in the hospital I delivered at telling me I wouldn't need a bottle or anything else because I would be breastfeeding as it was their policy, I felt a lot of pressure to do it. I BF'd him for more than a year and I did not enjoy it at all. I had to wear a nipple shield, he would only feed in a certain position, my supply had some bad moments and overall I felt like a walking cow. There was no nice bonding moments when I was BFing. I hated whenever it was time for him to feed. My husband told me it was okay to switch to formula if I wanted, but I heard so many negatives about formula I feared being judged harshly. I even tried pumping but it was too uncomfortable for not enough reward.\n\nAfter BFing my son I formula fed two daughters and will formula feed my son I am currently expecting. My husband was a pro at telling his family to mind their own business when they didn't like that I didn't breastfeed again.\n\nMy husband's youngest sister is 23 and now expecting her first baby. She came to me and asked about my decision not to breastfeed my girls and said she didn't have anyone else to turn to about it because her family were telling her she was breastfeeding. But she wasn't sure about it for her (SIL had some mental health trouble over the years and her breasts were a source of discomfort for her and have some issues today).  I told her my decision was made because I hated breastfeeding when I had my first, how miserable I was and how it just was not good for my mental health. I told her that I never got the amazing moments of bonding that so many talk about. I told her I don't doubt that they happen, for others, but it's not everyone. She was nodding along and I reassured her that she does not need to do it if she's not comfortable and her mental health is more important.\n\nMy MIL and three other SILs are all extremely unhappy with me for my honesty with her and they told me I should not discourage a FTM from breastfeeding. I told them they shouldn't tell people what to do. They should be supporting her through this. That surely they can see why she feels as she does given she has requested to remain dressed when she has her baby (at least she wants to cover her chest at all costs and has been open about that).

And that the real thing is no one prepared her for the reality of a sick child, or just having a child. She told me an age appropriate version of my birth story, and she's always said if I was her first birth she'd have never had another because it was terrifying. My aunt had the opposite experience and wanted more but her post partum depression was so bad she couldn't do that to the children she already had. \n\nI was 14 when I saw Scrubs and JD says, \"You'll fart, pee, puke and poop in front of 12 people staring intensely at your vagina!\" And almost 15 years later I still cannot deal with the personal embarrassment factor of that. \n\nI love kids. I do not like frequent changes, or plans being disrupted, or having to tone down my swearing, drinking, having \"adult\" 24/7 for them.

What kind of cult is this?", "NTA\n\nI couldn't breastfeed either. I can't really tell you why it would feel so f weird. Maybe i sexualized breasts to much or sth. I let others do and turn my head away when I see someone breastfeeding and that's it.", "NTA. They are not thinking of the baby either. Or the mother. Only themselves and their opinions.", "I cannot believe that there are still people in the world who need to be told that the very best thing a baby can have is a mother with sound mental health. NTA.", "NTA You gave her your experience exactly like she asked and it should be her decision, because it is her body. I breastfed my first one 18 months, mainly because he rejected both pacifiers and bottles. I always had lots of milk, few problems with latching and a very nice loss of weight during that time and it still was very hard and a huge toll on my sleep and mental health. I am now breastfeeding my second who is less ravenous and also likes pacifiers and bottles and i am still counting the day to the planned weaning with 9 months (3 weeks, wooohoo). And even though my hubby is the most involved father ever, it is almost impossible to really care equally for a breastfed baby, it will always default to the breast owner aka mommy.", "They are. They are saying I am swaying her against the best thing for her baby when she should be encouraged to do it and supported in it.", "Yes, I think especially when you hear nothing but positive or negative, hearing someone speak a bit differently can be what people need. Especially when they don't align with the general consensus of people around them.", "Thank you. It was rough. My husband worried a lot about me because of how it negatively affected me. I'm relieved I got more confident in my choice not to after I had my third child (second time around I was a lot more anxious and sad about the judgement but my experience with my second child was so much easier).", "No one can look at a class of kindergartens or high school seniors and pick out the formula vs. Breastmilk babies.", "I think \"First Time Mother\" but I too was a little confused...", "I was really thrown off by that too.", "It was meant as first time mom.", "FTM means first time mom in this context", "I'm sure some people think it's as easy as: you just put the nipple in the baby's mouth, and that's it! There's so much more to it, and it can be very tiring, painful and hard. The in-laws are weird for having such strong opinions about other people's boobs.", "Brainwashing. The cult of la leche.", "That info does not change anything for me because breastfeeding is not good for my mental health. But I also know people who were exclusively breastfed as babies who have chronic health issues that you mentioned.", "FTM also means first time mom. She is not a trans man. Sorry for the confusion.", "LOL I\u2019m a trans person who ended up in a parenting subreddit somehow once, and boy golly was I confused about how many FTMs there were.", "I was really confused about that too. Unless it's supposed to mean something else? Future Mom, maybe?", "Yes, I have tried to be honest with those people I know who are having babies and look for advice. I feel like I was soooo ill prepared for what I went through and more honesty and less pressure could have been a huge help.", "I will 100% do my best to support her through this so she can do what she'd like to do!", "Fed is best, end of. Not everyone even CAN breastfeed. Sometimes you can feed some of your babies but the milk won't come for one. \n\nThey are not encouraging or supporting, they are laying down the law. And a really bad outcome is a hungry, crying baby and a miserable, sobbing mother that can't express milk for him/her. The pressure *does not help*.", "Please tell your SIL that she is just as much a human being as her child and her feelings are valid. It\u2019s her child and her choice. And the family needs to be supportive either way. Being a new mom or having a new baby is hard enough as it is we don\u2019t need the constant shame for every little choice we make. As long as baby is being fed. That\u2019s all that matters", "NTA and thank you for your honesty. I  happened to have a pretty good experience with breastfeeding but a number of my friends didn't. What's best for the baby is that they're fed. Mom needs to be comfortable, too.", "The best baby is a fed baby. End of story.", "Definitely.  It\u2019s better for everyone if everything is shared so parents can make fully informed choices.\n\nBreastfeeding is just hard, emotional work.  I think if I have other kids, I\u2019ll probably do a mixed feed lol", "Your in-laws really really suck and I'm sorry that you have to deal with that. Fed is best and that's the end of it.", "My first breastfeeding was great! My middle child I felt like a cow being used and not free. Once we switched him to formula he got less grumpy.       \n\n\nEveryone and every pregnancy is different", "Thank you! I couldn't work it out on my own.", "Thank you! That makes way more sense.", "Ah. Gotcha.", "I can picture how confusing that would be! Especially in that particular subreddit lol.", "It means first time mom!", "I will further extend your definition of a \"bad outcome\" to a situation where the baby is fed but mom is miserable. \n\nMy mental health took a sharp upward turn when I started supplementing with formula (which, yes, probably did lead to the eventual demise of my supply!) because it meant I could leave the house without my baby for more than two hours, and at all in the afternoon/evening because cluster feeding (which is a literal circle of hell tbh). I had a pretty meager supply to begin with so I was spending a *lot* of mental and emotional energy counting ounces in the fridge and trying desperately to pump enough milk so I could go for a freaking bike ride.", "I was just like \u201cwow, good for all these guys having babies! oh wait..\u201d", "Thanks for clarifying! I was really confused :D \n\nRegardless of whether she's a first time mom or an nth time mom - she asked your opinion, you gave it. Definitely NTA, and her family can fuck right off with that kind of behavior. It's her choice to make entirely."]}
