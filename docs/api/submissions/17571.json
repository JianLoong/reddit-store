I divorced my ex wife back when I was 36 and have been with my current wife Jules ever since I was 38. Me and my ex wife do split custody so one week I have Bella and the next week her mom gets her. Then we split holidays in half. Well one of the weeks my daughter comes over is the same weekend that my wife has a weekend to herself this happens twice a month. This is where she\u2019ll rent out a place and then she\u2019ll have time to herself to clear her mind and just do her pretty much.\n\nI work from home so being cooped up in the house is very draining and my daughter hates being in the house all day so when my wife leaves often times me and my daughter will spend the whole weekend doing activities or things with won\u2019t be able to do with my wife. So think mountain climbing,surfing,scuba diving, long walks, road trips,camping, amusement parks, and etc. My wife knows what we do when she\u2019s gone it\u2019s no secret. But we do have a unspoken rule that this is considered our time to ourselves and we can\u2019t ask to go with that person in on that weekend. So my wife hates when we used to ask to come along or when we would suggest a family trip(before the rules where made)\n\nBella calls it D&D weekend and she always looks forward to it so it\u2019s sort of sentimental. Sadly my wife\u2019s trip to her hotel was sadly cancelled and she\u2019s stuck in the house. My daughter has recently wanted to go mall of America which is a nice drive from where we are at to Minnesota. She\u2019s been really excited to go because the last time we went she was very young and has few memories. My wife overheard us talking about the hotel we were going to stay at for the weekend and suggested that we all go together. I told her about the long drive and how we were really planning to stay all day. \n\nI also explained that this is our daddy daughter time and Bella really looks forward to it. She said that it can still be d&d but she\u2019ll just be there. I told her no that she can\u2019t go and that\u2019s it. I said not once has she ever wanted to tag along with us before nor has she ever invited us. She said that is different and her trips are to clear her mind. I told her that this is a sentimental thing for us and maybe we could do it some other weekend just not this one. Well she\u2019s pissed and is not talking to me. She said that I\u2019m being unfair and petty but I don\u2019t think so. Its our weekend and we have any other weekend to do whatever. I want my daughter to have memories before she gets old and I get older. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I will definitely be looking into my wife\u2019s weekend trips a lot of you have made points that she could be having an affair.", "created_utc": 1684429782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l4pev/aita_for_not_letting_my_wife_come_with_my_and_my/", "score": 374, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm just asking why this is something his wife can't do with them, and for him to clarify what he means by an unspoken rule.\n\nOP said in another post he goes fishing or drinking with friends, and he equated his wife's weekends as being a similar kind of thing. So they each have personal time to themselves as needed. OP doesn't really elaborate on the rule or what he means by not being invited to each other's respective outings. He also says it's an \"unspoken rule,\" which could mean a lot of things. Did they actually agree that neither party could go to each other's outings? Or did he try to invite himself and his daughter to one of his wife's weekends and she repeatedly turned them down, and so he decided then that his wife can then never attend a trip with him and his daughter? \n\nIt could also mean he invited his wife out to events with him and his daughter, and she always turned them down for whatever reason. Either way, I don't think an \"unspoken rule\" is a good reason to exclude your spouse from something. I'm asking for clarification because I find that bit kind of bizarre. Is it normal for couple to have rules about what sort of events their spouse is allowed to attend with them? I can't imagine going away for a fun weekend, and telling my partner they were not welcome to join me. \n\nI also think that the trips are very different and people are overlooking this. If the wife uses her weekends to sit by the pool and read and decompress or something like that, I understand why she would be against inviting OP and his daughter along. The purpose of her trips is not to spend time together with OP or the daughter, it's to be alone for whatever reason and have quiet time. So them going along would kind of defeat the purpose of the trip. OP also equated it to him fishing, or drinking with friends. Those are things he does alone, so why does his wife *need* to include him in her personal time? Is he including her whenever he fishes and drinks?\n\nOP's trips with his daughter are different than the wife's trips. It sounds like they're about having fun and doing different things. I don't see how his wife being there really changes this. OP gets to be with his daughter, and they can do what they like. Wife can get with the program, do her own thing, stay at the hotel, whatever. I just don't see how her going would be a big deal, or how it would even take away from OP and the daughter's time. They're still going to be together the entire time. If he thinks his wife is going to be a killjoy, he could lay down some ground rules and leave it at that. But telling her no, you are not allowed to go on the trip seems harsh to me.", "tbf, in my imagination she was doing cosplay.
