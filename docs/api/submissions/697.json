By telling her the truth you\u2019ve let her know that she has done nothing wrong and has nothing to feel ashamed but that by having a relationship with her it would hurt your mother\u2019s feelings and that you just aren\u2019t able to do that.", "YTA - that is a 12 year old with emotions and a yearning for family!

Your dad\u2019s had years to think about how to explain to her why he doesn\u2019t have a relationship with you or what he\u2019d do if she went looking for answers herself.

But even if not for step sis... your mom was going to leave him.. or they would have been arguing about it constant.. or they could have just stayed in a dead marriage and faked it, showing you a bad example of what marriage is, that damaged you. In any case, it was not going to be the ideal life that you think it might have!", "NTA. You worded your refusal kindly and wished her well at the end too. You need not lie to her or be forced into something you don't want. Good luck to you.", "No, but they are valid and important! A simple: \"ask your dad why\" would have sufficed. Especially given that OP has opted not to start a relationship with step sis! She basically threw a match and walked off to let the little girls world burn...."]}
