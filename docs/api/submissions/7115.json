Sam has always loved cars and one of his dream presents was those kid cars where you could drive around.\n\nIt was time for his birthday and everything went well except for when he had to open the presents. Since he had a sister (5f) I decided it would be fun to give them both a car each so they could play together. I of course gave him some extra toys since it was his special day. But he started crying and saying it was unfair she also got a present even though it was not her birthday. I was a bit shocked and told him I gave him some extra stuff. He still did not stop crying. So I took the gifts and told him that I would be giving them back only until he accepts his sister is getting one too. \n\nI am not sure why exactly he was reacting this way, it was a bit unusual. People in my family think I was being mean and after thinking for a while I have started to think I am in the wrong. So am I in the wrong?\n\nEdit: After reading some comments I  decided to talk with his parents. We agreed that I would give them the cars and so I did. I didn't realize  what effect this could have on him until I read the comments. So I am currently wondering if I should take him to some places he likes? Tomorrow I will have free time to pick him up after school. I asked his parents if that would be okay and they said yes.

You gave him a present he really really wanted BUT you also gave one to his sister and that's kind of a big gift to give someone on somebody else's birthday. You took the spotlight off of him in the name of equality and then you punished him in a big way for being 7 and not being able to understand what was going on or accurately describe why he feels how he feels.\n\nInfo: why couldn't you have waited for her birthday to get/give her the car?", "YTA It was a gift and it was his birthday. Cut him some slack, he's a little boy who doesn't understand why his sister is getting presents on his \"special\" day, too. Punishing him for not understanding this by taking it away is something he will never forget and at his age and will not understand.", "YTA, this is a child lol You kinda told him his special day isn't that special (doesn't need to make sense, he's 7...)\n\nCouldn't you have given her the gift at a different time and avoided this altogether?", ">It was time for his birthday and everything went well except for when he had to open the presents. Since he had a sister (5f) I decided it would be fun to give them both a car each so they could play together.\n\nIt was his birthday (a day to celebrate him), and cars are his thing. By giving his younger sister the exact same car as well, you are underplaying the importance of your nephew's self-identity and interests. Yes, it'd be cute if they did have something to share; however, this ain't it given the context.\n\nYTA, albeit an accidental one.", "YTA\n\nWhen you have a younger sibling at that age, you feel like everything is about them. Your birthday is finally your own day, and you started it off taking that away by giving her gifts.\n\nIt was his day, and you definitely ruined it by taking the toys away. It\u2019s one of the few days you should cut the kid a break.\n\nNormalize apologizing to children, they\u2019re still people. Give him his present back, and say sorry.", "YTA. Kids want to feel \"special\" on their birthday. If a sibling gets the same extravagant gift they do, that sucks. And then you took the gifts back? You suck more.", "Soft YTA. I understand your frustration but he is 7 and that\u2019s a tough age to express emotions accurately.  I wouldn\u2019t have taken his gifts away, that\u2019s just rude and doesn\u2019t solve any problems.", "YTA, you should have let him keep the gifts. It\u2019s a kid.", "YTA for taking the gifts back from a 7 year old. You could have a conversation with him about it later, etc, after he was calm. Also, you did maybe set a precedent for the immediate future - are you going to bring him something on her next birthday?", "YTA. You're teaching your niece that she's entitled to receive gifts on other people's birthdays, and you're teaching your nephew that he doesn't deserve his own special day.", "YTA, you took away his birthday gifts because he was upset. You made his birthday less special by getting his sister what he really wanted for his birthday. He's allowed to be upset about stuff like that.", "Well yeah, of course YTA.  You set yourself up for this awkward situation by bringing big gifts for two kids to one kid's birthday party.  Then when a 7 year old responded in a childish way (because he's a child), you compounded the awkwardness by holding his birthday gift hostage.  You're 22, you're obviously not a parent, you really should have looked to his parents for help.  This would have been a good teaching moment where he could have been told that he'd just gotten nice gifts, and it wasn't right to complain about his sister getting one, and besides now they can play together.  And then move on.  Live and learn, but I think you should have Mom explain, and then give them the gifts.", "Very light YTA, you had good intentions but it was his special day where he's expecting to be the center of attention, especially at 7 yo. Speaking as a guy who has a sister, we had to share everything as kids so seeing his sister get attention on his birthday probably just rubbed him the wrong way. He's acting a bit bratty, but I mean he's 7 yo so you have to be the bigger person (literally).", "YTA - it is a child. A young one at that.", "YTA\n\nFor taking the toy he is seven seven year olds cry and can't express or control their emotions like adults....  He wanted his day too be all about him ... Is it great behavior no is it shocking for a seven year old no ....", "YTA, this is a completely normal reaction for a child and could have been a great learning opportunity.   Instead you punished this child for having normal child feelings.", "YTA you don\u2019t give a gift to another child during his birthday.", "soft YTA - he's 7. Them 7 year olds aren't great with the auld emotional regulation, and from his point of view you gave his sister a huge present on HIS birthday, which was meant to be his day. He didn't notice the other gifts because the massive car is kinda the show stopper here. It wasn't really your place to parent him. You got him the present for his birthday and now you're telling him it's conditional on him being good - that's not the deal. Yes, he's being an entitled brat about it, sure, I'd be really frustrated with his reaction too, but y'kinda did a whoopsie here.", "INFO: did you consult with his parents about buying two cars, one for each kid? Did you consult with his parents before you took back the gifts?", "YTA. Let\u2019s face it- he\u2019s 7.  He doesn\u2019t get fairness, maturity, sharing etc yet.  He\u2019s just learning the concepts and you gave him a crash course on his birthday.  You should have given him a gift and then after he opens it say \u201coh and I got something for you and your sister to play together with\u201d.", "YTA. 7 yr old probably already noticed that baby sister is a bit spoiled (in his mind). You just validated that.", "[deleted]", "YTA, but I do have sympathy for your position.  You undermined the specialness of his birthday by giving this great present to his sister.  It would have been better to wait until her birthday to give her the car, or you could have gifted the cars to both for Christmas.  Then to take his car away for being understandably upset was even worse.  He\u2019s allowed to have hurt feelings.  It\u2019s not like he broke his sister\u2019s car while having a tantrum.  You should find a way to make amends with him", "I think it\u2019s definitely a bit rough to put a newly 7 year old through, but I lean towards communication not punishment. \n\nI also like natural consequences and in this case it would simply be I would not gift him a present on his sisters birthday. \n\nTo be perfectly transparent tho: this is something his parents should have handled. Not a 22 year old aunt. If the parents believe it was inappropriate, then it just was. \n\nTry to remember that at 5-7 it\u2019s just really hard processing exciting and upsetting feelings. The dynamic of a birthday party is extremely stimulating and I still haven\u2019t met many kids that age that actually display their best behavior at their parties", "YTA He\u2019s 7 and it was HIS special day.", "YTA for taking the toys away, but completely in your right to gift whatever you want to whoever you want. When I go to a party with very young children I will pick up something small for the sibling. Expected? No. A nice thing to do, yes\u2026 especially for younger siblings. They understand it\u2019s not their day, but that doesn\u2019t mean that their feelings aren\u2019t hurt just a little bit. \n\nI probably would have given the gifts and let their mom sort out the boy\u2019s feelings. Sometimes kids get overstimulated and act in a way they might not on any other day.", "YTA. He is 7, you got him the gift to celebrate his special day. You got his sister the same big gift, which makes his day no longer special. You then take it back because he had an emotional response? 7 year olds don\u2019t have full control of their emotions, it\u2019s not a lesson to be taught, they just don\u2019t developmentally have it. A NTA would say, im sorry I made you feel this way, I love you very much and I got the car for your sister so you will have someone to play cars with. Instead, you met his lack of emotional control with your own lack of emotional control, or, even worse, you are trying to control his emotions. So, turns out you are a double YTA\u2026..", "YTA. I know what 7 years old is a little bit older but still not old enough to know better. He did the best he could and taking away toys on a birthday will be remembered forever.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Children can sometimes be very preoccupied with fairness.", "YTA I get the point you were trying to make but look at it from the kids perspective. He's the eldest which means most everyone's attention has probably been on his sister since she's been born. He's probably seen her have more leniency when it comes to things like punishments and chores or whatever because she's younger. But it feels unfair to him. So he probably expected and wanted one day to be just only about him. (I could be wrong but this is just my guess as to why he acted that way. We as adults know someone else getting the same thing as you doesn't mean you'll enjoy it less but he is 7 years old)", "YTA.  I understand wanting to give her one also, but you don't take a young child's presents away after you've given them.  What he sees is that she gets presents on his birthday but when it is her birthday he gets nothing.  You've just reinforced the idea that she's the one that gets special treatment.", "YTA.

You sound horrible for this.", "YTA- He was having a meltdown- he is 7. He doesn't understand you giving his sister a gift for his birthday and you could have handled it better than taking his gifts away.", "This is a difficult situation, and it sounds like your intentions were good but the outcome wasn't what you were hoping for. However, in this situation, YWBTA .  \nThe way you handled the situation was not appropriate and could have handled it in a much better way. Telling a crying child, especially a young one, that you will take back the gift is not a good way to deal with the situation. The child might not understand the concept and might feel guilty. Additionally, it might have negative effect on the relationship with your nephew.  \nIt's understandable that you might have been frustrated with the situation, but it's important to remember that children can react differently to things and don't always understand everything. It's best to try and find a solution that works for everyone rather than taking a gift back from a child who's crying and upset.  \nIt's always a good idea to talk to your family and get their feedback, if you feel in doubt about your decision.", "Okay, you are not in the wrong to gift your niece a car (if you\u2019re asking for that part as well) but I think the way you went when he had a fit and took his toy away was the Butt-hole move.\n\nI know his behavior is unacceptable but you could have explained it better to him instead of \u201cLook! I got you extra stuff!\u201d Maybe explain to him you bought it for him and his sister to enjoy together and if they both like to have a race?  To him, letting his sister have a gift on his day confused him, but explaining it better might help?", "[deleted]", "NTA. He acted entitled, and I don't blame you for being taken aback.\n\nI think your reaction was good. You didn't just remove the gifts forever.

It's no longer yours to take back (have a conversation with him/his parents). I'm also wondering why you didn't hold onto his sisters gift and wait until her birthday to gift it to her?

Its hidden until his birthday in 6 months.", "Yta ..  it wasn't your job to discipline this child on their birthday. Let their parent deal with it. It's super annoying when non-parents do this. You don't know the dynamic, even if you think you do. My mom is over all the time, so she mostly gets my kids, and if something is really wrong, she will step in. (Time out you hit your sister type stuff). But this meltdown was truly a parenting decision. It probably would be what I would do.  But, I have had it too many times where sil does something completely logical that isn't right for my kids. And since it's his birthday, his parents should have dictated how to respond. Maybe he is overwhelmed. Maybe he has been struggling with this stuff and all he needs is a hug and a few minutes and you escalated it. who knows what they would have done...", "INFO: curious what his parents did about this behavior.

It's so interesting reading y'alls comments because these are some things I have not thought about before.", "I did tell them I would be buying two cars. They were fine with that.

We see that alot her where one child has been made to share everything with a sibling but that sibling never does.

The kid is young, and unless it is common in your family to give one present to all siblings on birthdays, he probably didn't understand what was going on. He expressed his confusion and hurt of not being the only one being celebrated on his special day by crying, only to have the cars he did have taken away. I would give them back asap and maybe take him out for some ice cream, poor guy is prob super confused.\n\nINFO: how did his parents/your family react?\n\n(Edit: grammer)", "Soft YTA- you don\u2019t take back gifts that you\u2019ve already been given. Once you give them, they no longer belong to you. Pretty simple rule. It would\u2019ve been better to warn him that next time you\u2019re just not going to give any gifts if he is going to act this way. The problem is he expected you to take that car and give it to him instead and that\u2019s not acceptable. He\u2019s young and he needs a grown-up to explain that to him.", "YTA. But you\u2019ve read the comments so you know why.  If you had gotten it for both of them to play\u2026.do it on a holiday or random day. Not on someone\u2019s birthday.  \n\nBut also as an older sibling I remember being mad too (though I think I was younger than 7]. Because as the older sibling, on my birthday my younger sibling got some presents because they were \u201ctoo young\u201d to understand why on my birthday only I got presents or was celebrated. But when it was their birthday, well I\u2019m older so I should know not to expect gifts right? I\u2019m older, so i should be able to share the toys I loved the most. I\u2019m older, so i should know to not be celebrated or given spotlight during their bday.  The kid is 7, and his feelings were valid.  It was unfair that on a day celebrating his existence solely, a family member was seen celebrating his little sister by giving her something HE truly loved.  Doesn\u2019t matter that he got the same item, because by then he was so upset and probably hurt\\confused on why you did it OP. \n\nBest adult metaphor I can come up with is you essentially were like when someone uses a family or friend\u2019s wedding to propose to your SO (without bride or groom consent). It\u2019s not accurate metaphor for you giving gifts, but for what your nephew experienced on his bday. Though I suck at metaphors \ud83e\udd23", "YTA. It was his birthday.

That would be mean. But, you can't use both of the cars at the same time, right? Wouldn't it be fun to let your sister drive one of your cars around with you? Maybe you two could have a race!\"\n\nAnd then bam, attention redirected and everyone is happy for the rest of the day.\n\nInstead you went nuclear on a 7 year old and went \"if you don't both get presents then neither of you get presents\" which, for the birthday boy, is villain levels of laughably unfair.

Why do this?", "My nephew looked annoyed on his birthday when all the other kids were \"helping\" unwrap his presents, to the point they shoved him outta the way. He looked like he had a much better time at Christmas when he was allowed to open his gifts with help from mom and grandma.\n\nA small gift, I don't see the harm in buying one for a younger sibling.

You weren't an AH intentionally, however, you hurt the boy by also gifting his sister the 'special' present you got him & then taking it all away. You caused that scene my friend.
