My husband and I got there first and found a large picnic style table that was close to the bar while we waited for our group to get there. It was basically two (2) large picnic tables side by side and you could easily fit our group on one (1) table and another large group on the other.\n\nWhile we were waiting, a woman approached us and asked if she and her group could take the other side of the table. We told her yes, and she signaled for her friend partner. He came to the table and he had an infant carrier and was holding the hand of a toddler. I immediately looked at my husband and said \"It would have been nice of her to mention that they had kids with them.\" \n\nA few minutes after they sat down, the rest of their group (six people in total) came to the table and each of them had kids with them! One of the kids, who was about 2-3 years old was screaming to be put down and immediately started running when they did. \n\nI was pretty upset and told the woman that it was really not cool of her to not even mention that their entire group had small children and that there were plenty of other tables that would have accommodated them in the taproom. \n\nThey ended up moving tables, but not after the friend/partner of the first woman said it was not cool of me to make them move tables.\n\nMy husband said that I was out of line, and when we told this to our friends, they were split, with half of them agreeing that it was not okay for them to not say anything about the kids, and the others saying that there is no rule against having kids in the taproom so I should have just let it go.\n\nSo AITA for calling out a woman at the brewery?", "created_utc": 1683904861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fo32h/aita_for_calling_out_a_woman_at_the_brewery/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially when they're at a difficult crying/tantrum age.  It's rude.\n\n*edit for parents trying to justify being inconsiderate:*\n\nYou're at a brewery with your kids.  Same scenario, adjoining table.  I grab that spot with a fully adult group even though there are a lot of other options.  We have a couple beers and launch into decidedly adult topics.  AITA?  Obviously, yes.\n\nLike your kids we have the right to exist in that space, no?  We're in public so you can't expect it to be an environment that caters to children right?  Especially if alcohol is being served.  Isn't being so intentionally obtuse exhausting?  Respect and basic consideration for others shouldn't just go one way.", "NTA, she hid the kids and general size of the party of purpose.

As a patron, I don't expect to find children in a brewery, let alone a group of people with several small children. In my opinion, this is not the kind of establishment you take children to, and traditionally they weren't framed as family-friendly places anyway. So I can sympathize with your annoyance at having them sit beside you, all the more if one of the kids was already being loud and disruptive of the atmosphere. I think that group of people suck for choosing a brewery of all places to gather with their little ones. \n\nHowever, this is for the brewery's owners/managers to sort. If the place welcomes people with children and lets them make use of the premises, then they're allowed to do so. The woman that approached you had no obligation to disclose who was going to sit with her group and what ages they are, and you had no right to make rude remarks about it to her and imply that they should move tables. It was actually gracious of them to move tables anyway, because they certainly didn't have to. They did it just to avoid your rudeness. So you suck for policing the table next to you and act as if they owed you information. \n\nMaybe just double check if the place you're going to with your friends allows children, before booking.", "YTA\n\nI would hate it too but you\u2019re in a public place and families with children can show up sometimes, it happens", "[deleted]", "YTA.
