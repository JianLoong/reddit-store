This was an actual brewery/taproom that brews and serves its own craft beers. Where I live they are forbidden by state law to serve food of any kind. The only non-alcoholic drink they are legally permitted to serve is water, and that is required by state law to be provided free of charge. The taprooms that we go to that allow children/families have a separate area that is for families only, this one did not.*** \n\n***Also for those that keep asking why we did not move-had we known that this group had children we would have moved, no questions asked. They moved before we had the chance to even get up and switch tables. I never asked them to leave or move, I only told the woman who originally asked us if she could have the table that it would have been nice of her to let us know they had kids.*** \n\n***Lastly, I have children myself. The conversations we have/games we play are often times not kid friendly. I do not know of any parent who would want to have their kids listen to a group of adults playing Cards Against Humanity or how an emesis bag leaked and ruined a pair of shoes. So we absolutely would have moved because we would not want little ears to hear inappropriate things.***\n\nMy husband and I meet with a group of friends (8 people total) every Friday. We choose a brewery and meet there for a couple of beers and play games (cards against humanity, Uno, Trivial Pursuit). Just a fun night with friends, and an all around good time. We are all in our 30's and 40's, some of us have small kids others (like us) are empty nesters. It's an adult only thing, so the friends in the group that have small kids get babysitters so that we can have adult time.\n\nWe went to the brewery last week (it's about an hour and a half drive for four out of the eight of us) that we have wanted to try for almost a year. My husband and I got there first and found a large picnic style table that was close to the bar while we waited for our group to get there. It was basically two (2) large picnic tables side by side and you could easily fit our group on one (1) table and another large group on the other.\n\nWhile we were waiting, a woman approached us and asked if she and her group could take the other side of the table. We told her yes, and she signaled for her friend partner. He came to the table and he had an infant carrier and was holding the hand of a toddler. I immediately looked at my husband and said \"It would have been nice of her to mention that they had kids with them.\"\n\nA few minutes after they sat down, the rest of their group (six people in total) came to the table and each of them had kids with them! One of the kids, who was about 2-3 years old was screaming to be put down and immediately started running when they did.\n\nI was pretty upset and told the woman that it was really not cool of her to not even mention that their entire group had small children and that there were plenty of other tables that would have accommodated them in the taproom.\n\nThey ended up moving tables, but not after the friend/partner of the first woman said it was not cool of me to make them move tables.\n\nMy husband said that I was out of line, and when we told this to our friends, they were split, with half of them agreeing that it was not okay for them to not say anything about the kids, and the others saying that there is no rule against having kids in the taproom so I should have just let it go.\n\nSo AITA for calling out a woman at the brewery?", "created_utc": 1683904861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fo32h/aita_for_calling_out_a_woman_at_the_brewery/", "score": 783, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially when they're at a difficult crying/tantrum age.  It's rude.\n\n*edit for parents trying to justify being inconsiderate:*\n\nYou're at a brewery with your kids.  Same scenario, adjoining table.  I grab that spot with a fully adult group even though there are a lot of other options.  We have a couple beers and launch into decidedly adult topics.  AITA?  Obviously, yes.\n\nLike your kids we have the right to exist in that space, no?  We're in public so you can't expect it to be an environment that caters to children right?

As a patron, I don't expect to find children in a brewery, let alone a group of people with several small children. In my opinion, this is not the kind of establishment you take children to, and traditionally they weren't framed as family-friendly places anyway. So I can sympathize with your annoyance at having them sit beside you, all the more if one of the kids was already being loud and disruptive of the atmosphere. I think that group of people suck for choosing a brewery of all places to gather with their little ones. \n\nHowever, this is for the brewery's owners/managers to sort. If the place welcomes people with children and lets them make use of the premises, then they're allowed to do so. The woman that approached you had no obligation to disclose who was going to sit with her group and what ages they are, and you had no right to make rude remarks about it to her and imply that they should move tables. It was actually gracious of them to move tables anyway, because they certainly didn't have to. They did it just to avoid your rudeness. So you suck for policing the table next to you and act as if they owed you information. \n\nMaybe just double check if the place you're going to with your friends allows children, before booking.", "YTA\n\nI would hate it too but you\u2019re in a public place and families with children can show up sometimes, it happens", "[deleted]", "YTA.

If someone doesn\u2019t like the business\u2019 rules they can go somewhere else, probably somewhere that\u2019s 21+.", "One thing to note is my bias comes from service, and knowing how drunks behave. If the brewery in question is strict about overindulgence, not so bad IMO", "LoL I'm pretty sure I was clear about that, but whatever. And to be honest, people with kids aren't entitled to be catered to either. You chose them, they should only be your problem. But if you feel kids being around drunks is ok, well.... smfh that's definitely an interesting choice.", "But how would that be any different than moving when you saw the kids?", "You still had the option to move tables, so this should be a non problem if that was going to be your solution", ">where kids are allowed to be\n\nWhere kids are allowed to be and where they should be are two totally different things.\n\nWe're not all down mama breast feeding a baby at the bar sitting in front of a glass of beer while taking a drag off of a Kool.\n\nI wish that was over the top, but I've seen that sight. Kids don't belong in bars, and like it or not, a brewery with a tap room is a bar.", "Ahh yes, cause if it\u2019s legal and allowed it\u2019s got to be ok. So glad that American red states are putting kids back to work. Can\u2019t wait to chug a beer with them after their shift in the lithium mine", "People here can\u2019t seem to comprehend words. You clearly said it was not a restaurant. Geezus Christ.", "From how you describe the place, it\u2019s definitely not somewhere I\u2019d expect to see kids\u2026BUT as long as they\u2019re allowed there, the other person did nothing wrong. She didn\u2019t have to tell you there were kids and you should have just gotten up and moved when you saw them.\n\nThis is a situation where you\u2019re fine to be mildly annoyed but not fine to call someone out.\n\nYTA.", "But the law didn\u2019t stop kids from entering so YTA, it\u2019s\nPpl like you that make me want to stay home bc someone is gonna bitch if I take my kid with me to do anything. I notice you keep trying to correct people by detailing this places and it\u2019s not about that, the fact is you could have gone to a bar if you didn\u2019t want to see kids.  ppl who can\u2019t get a sitter and want to meet up this is what they do, not everyone with a kid wants to go to Chick-fil-A or a McDonald play place to meet up. When you said (not us) then in the comments said you had kids I figured you mean yours are older.  you\u2019re lucky you raised them when kids weren\u2019t seen as a trigger to everyone. These kids will grow up and save lives as drs, firemen, emts, etc\u2026 maybe they should be saved the trouble of dealing with the ah that looked down on them.", "no it isn\u2019t. it\u2019s a bit of a stretch but i understand what they mean. another way to get the idea across would be them saying \u201cwhat is op was sensitive to smells, would the lady have to automatically know and warn her about her perfume?\u201d but i completely understand what the original comment meant.", "You are completely changing your reasoning now that you are overwhelming TA. You said they kids cried and ran and you were annoyed they didn\u2019t tell you. \n\nAnd maybe no one wants to hear you and your friends witty banter, every consider that? I have worked in many taprooms and you seem like a nightmare customer. I would have kicked you and your party out for telling other customers to move. Like who the fuck does that.", "Ok so then don\u2019t bring your kids to a taproom. If the kids are allowed there, you don\u2019t get to say wether other people bring their kids. If kids were not allowed and they brought them anyway that\u2019s different, but they clearly are if they didn\u2019t get kicked out. You\u2019ve gotten your judgement, if you didn\u2019t want that why did you post here?", "\u201cIt would have been nice for you to immediately inform us that you didn\u2019t wish children to be near you when we asked to sit down.  You know, just in case we had any.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what they should have said to you, correct?", "Pearl river is in New York on the east coast but understood :)", "Same! I just assume there will be kids (and dogs) there. I've been to a brewery where someone brought their chicken on a leash \ud83d\ude02 most of the breweries in my area have family friendly events too like trick or treat and most do not serve food.", "Same.. especially with outdoor seating and live music.", "We have two neighborhood breweries. One is essentially a day care on Friday afternoons, and the other got rid of all of their high chairs a month after opening. We know which one is family friendly and the only one we go to when we take the kids.", "And it sucks...", "I live in a place where kids are technically allowed at breweries and wineries but it\u2019s extremely uncommon to actually see any there - and when you do it\u2019s usually like an infant or a well-behaved older child that is reading a book or something. Some people bring dogs too. Granted I live in a city that many people consider to be not \u201cfamily friendly\u201d but myself and many friends grew up here. \n\nI visited a town last year where there were kids literally everywhere, running around down the Main Street/boardwalk, parents not paying attention to them. This was a town I\u2019d never been to but was definitely described as an upscale coastal town so I was surprised how many wild children were running around screaming, scaring wildlife, running into the middle of the street. A lot of people also had dogs out and about. I absolutely love dogs and love seeing them in public, but many of these dogs exhibited nervous behaviors and the owners paid them no attention, similar to how they ignored their children. We visited a brewery and there were SO MANY anxious looking dogs and unattended children running around the whole damn place, one of the kids ran into me walking back from a taco truck and knocked my food out of my hands, then stepped on a dog\u2019s tail. There were literally kids playing under the table I was sitting at (Covid rules were still strongly in effect and people were seated with at least one empty table between groups) and I felt like I had to watch my conversations to not say anything inappropriate. Although maybe a few f bombs would have made the parents pay attention and get their kids out of my personal space.\n\nI\u2019m all for kids and dogs being allowed everywhere but you can\u2019t just assume everyone in the vicinity will be a proper babysitter just because you don\u2019t want to watch your own kids. I certainly don\u2019t want to watch them.", "Not where I\u2019m from\u2026", "Really? I mean, sure. But alcohol and nothing else? Strange notion.", "Functioning alcoholism seems to be a prerequisite to being a parent these days", "Congratulations you are the 100th person to say the exact same comment. So stop now.", "Are you talking about parents who bring kids to a bar for lunch, or nighttime environment?", "I work at a brewery and due to my state's laws we can only serve a person 3 beers a day. We're pretty strict about over indulgence and very family friendly.", "Who is getting wasted at breweries? People are not drinking at breweries like they would at a bar.", "Every brewery I've been to has been a BREWERY. They make and sell beer, and if they have food, it's a food truck parked out back. I'm sorry, but just because you CAN bring a kid does not mean you SHOULD.", "Wow. That was insanely rude! I 100% would have moved if we knew they had kids.", "It is not a restaurant! It is a literal brewery that makes and serves its own beer. Where we live these places are forbidden by state law to serve food of any kind. The only non-alcoholic beverage they are legally allowed to serve is water, and it has to be provided free of charge. If you want food, you have to bring your own or leave and go to a restaurant and come back.", "\n>You keep saying this, yet upon seeing the kids, you didn't just move tables.  Very strange.\n\nThat's because they're making up excuses as they go", "Right. And we would have had we had the chance to get up. They moved while we were getting up to leave.", "I did an edit after you and someone else mentioned this. I find it odd that your breweries serve food! I think it has to do with the permitting/insurance. Some places do have food trucks, but they are not allowed to be in the parking lot (I assume for insurance/liability issues) and you can get food from them, but those are pretty rare.", "Yes, if people are abiding by laws and policies of private establishments it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re bitching and saying parents who do this think the world revolves around then while AT THE SAME TIME complaining because you want to world to revolve around your preferences. \n\nHow moronic do you need to be to miss the irony?", "I absolutely do have children. Two of them. My oldest is 22 and the youngest is 20. The oldest is in college and comes home on weekends and the other lives at home but is currently training as an electrician. You don't stop having kids and being a parent because you have adult children.", "they do it to skirt liquor licensing regulations", "No. This is like a craft brewery. Some have family areas, some do not. Most places that don't have a family area do not allow kids, so this was pretty shocking to us that they brought kids.", "We did. And we would have if we knew that they had children. They moved before we even had a chance to get up!", "She also states that you can bring your own food and drink. They were sitting outside at picnic tables, which tells me that there's an area where kids can run around. Again, if there's no signs that say no one under 21 is allowed, she's wrong.", "The brewpub near me allows children under 12 or people over 18 but no teenagers.", "there is a few scenes in the show madmen where kids are have plastic bags over their heads but when their mother scolds them its for running in the house, in 50 years i feel this comment will read the same", "I mean... why? There's still plenty of dive bars where kids don't go.", "Why?  I\u2019ve never been to any brewery/ tap room that didn\u2019t have some kids bouncing around.  Parents bring snacks and sippy cups.  I thinks it\u2019s crazy to assume that because they don\u2019t cater to kids that there\u2019ll be no kids.", "Lately? In the 80s, my mom\u2019s best friend could hardly take her middle child anywhere because he was so wild. We always had to go places that were explicitly child friendly. Kids, as a whole, have never been calm and docile.", "Kids weren't calm and docile back in the day as well, though.", "Maybe part of it is because parents are too scared to go out with their kids.  So kids don't know how to behave in public. (It;s not an excuse but, damn, it's gotta be rough for parents these days.  Can't go anywhere without getting hate.)", "Thanks! Oh and also FO.", "In my example from work, it's lunch. No one under 21 after 8pm (by local law)\n\nEdit: check my other replies detailing my bar. Definitely unfit for kids at any time.", "Honestly, that sounds like a place I'd appreciate.", "I guess the ones I've been to weren't good breweries then. I'd definitely feel differently, if I knew a place wasn't dealing with binge drinking", "I come from the PNW, where 70% of American hops are grown. Nearly all breweries here will accommodate families(and dogs!). Can only recall a handful of 21+ restricted, out of like a good 1000 across WA & OR.", "So, were you sitting in the tap room, or were you sitting outside in an open area? In it again anywhere are there signs that say no one under 21 is allowed in that area", "There are plenty of places where you can do that. Clearly the place OP was at was not that kind of place. If a place allows kids parents are free to bring their kids there.", "So then find a brewery that doesn't allow children or a bar that has some local beers on tap. It's not that hard. My husband and I find places to go for a couple of drinks when we don't have our kids with us and don't want to deal with kids whose parents let them run around screaming.", "Yeah, breweries tend to brew things, but they were literally talking about a brewery with a tap room (which is really common)? When I was a kid my favorite restaurant was a brewery in St. Louis that has fantastic pub food. Bars and breweries arent the same thing.\n\nYou can get a cocktail at Red Lobster too but I don't think that means they should bad kids from going lol", "And yet... When the kids arrived, and you became 100% aware they had kids, you made them move instead. You literally had the opportunity to do what you claim you would have done... So I say you're full of BS and just upset that YTA.", "So why didn\u2019t you?", "You did know! The kids arrived before your friends did! Why not move then?", "WHY COULDN'T YOU MOVE AFTER YOU FUCKING SAW THOOOOO", "Ok but why couldn't you guys move after you saw the kids? You won't tell us", "Ok so it was a non problem but you decided you had something to say anyway?", "How did a group with lots of small kids get up and move before you?", "My preferences? I\u2019m Canadian where cannabis is legal. Your argument would apply to smoke shops and weed patios as well? Theres certain places that aren\u2019t child friendly. No matter how bad you need your fix", "I love beer and going to breweries. I live in a city with a ton of excellent breweries and whenever I\u2019m in another city/state I make sure to check out at least one brewery. I know I\u2019ve been to over 40 breweries in my metro area, I\u2019ve probably been to ~80 total.\n\nAll of that is to say I\u2019m very curious about what US state you are in because I can\u2019t remember even once seeing a taproom with an entirely separate area for families. That you keep repeating that in your comments as if it\u2019s normal is throwing me. I\u2019ve been to plenty that don\u2019t allow kids, but not a single one that has a family section and a separate adult section. Which leads me to conclude that either this is a quirk in your state/region, or you\u2019re pulling that out of your ass.\n\nLook, kids at breweries/taprooms is a contentious issue. I understand people who don\u2019t want them there. But in every taproom I\u2019ve been to, either there\u2019s an age limit or there isn\u2019t and you might encounter children, and it wouldn\u2019t be expected for anybody to disclose they are there with children as a warning to all nearby. From my perspective, one of someone who regularly spends time in the space you\u2019ve described, you handled this really badly.", "Yes that is what most craft breweries are like now, restaurants.", "But why didn\u2019t you just move instead of making the comment to her that prompted their group to move?", "OP states they were inside, and there is no outdoor area nor a designated place for kids to run around. and i would guess that even though patrons can bring snacks, they probably can't bring drinks since that is the only thing being sold.", "Why's that?", "Again, we would have absolutely moved if we had known that their group had children. They moved before we even had a chance to get up! They could have had the entire table for themselves. The whole purpose of this get togethers is for adult time, which is why we go to breweries. The ones we go to that are kid friendly have separate areas for families, this one did not, which is why we will not be going back.", "Oh. I wasn't sure that was allowed. I will make those changes.", "No, it really doesn't.", "Yes people take their kids to all kinds of places, that doesn\u2019t mean that they should.  IMHO children do not belong at a brewery, especially when no food is served, in the evening.   Can the parents not find another kid-friendly place to go?    Even well behaved children don\u2019t belong at all places all the time.  If it was a sunny weekend afternoon when lots of groups were picnicking and enjoying a beverage, that is one thing and expected.  \n\nThis goes long the same lines as the people who complain  because the wedding they were at last weekend was dry.  If you can\u2019t enjoy time with friends and family without alcohol you have a problem.  And I LOVE my alcohol, but if it isn\u2019t available that does not ruin my experience.", "I just feel like they\u2019ve been more wild since the pandemic and since parents use their iPhones to parent", "I mean I was a well behaved child and when I wasn\u2019t my mom took me home which taught me a lesson. Parents shouldn\u2019t be fearful if they\u2019re raising good kids", "Nope. Doesn't make you cool, but ok.", "That\u2019s sad.", "You\u2019re changing the subject. It\u2019s not a bar it\u2019s a brewery. Some tables and beer, and clearly an out door area with picnic tables. You\u2019re saying kids shouldn\u2019t be able to sit at a picnic table outside with their parents bc of what a  city bar entails.", "We close at 8 pm, I've only had to cut off one drunk asshole in 3 years, and we don't have to sweep, mop, or roll silverware. It's a place I very much appreciate lol", "I\u2019m definitely learning a lot about how other areas of the country operate around breweries. It seems like a lot of them are more of a \u201cbrew pub\u201d vs brewery. Like how a \u201cbar\u201d is different from a \u201cbar and grille\u201d. Just shocking to me to tbh", "We were sitting in the actual taproom itself. This brewery does not have an outdoor seating area.", "I never made them move, nor did I ask them to move. The woman asked if she could sit there, we didn't see the kids, and we said yes. She didn't have beer so we assumed she was either (1) just saving the table or (2) someone was ordering her drink for her and coming to the table. As soon as we saw the kids we started putting away the cards against humanity and grabbing our beers to move. Before we had even had the chance to move, they had already sat at a different table, but not before the rest of the group showed up and the other toddler started screaming to be put down.", "I have mentioned this several times. We were in the process of getting up to leave when they were already taking another table. The man and the children hadn't even sat down yet, only the woman who asked if she could sit there. We were in the process of getting our beers and cleaning up the cards against humanity to move to another table. So that is why we didn't just get up and move. Because we had to clean up our stuff and get our things to move to another table. They didn't even have beers yet, they were just looking for a place to sit first.", "Because not everyone is so spineless that they're afraid to comment when people around them are being inconsiderate.", "And where I live it\u2019s illegal for children to go into those places. So my point is still valid: if it\u2019s legal and in line with a private institution\u2019s policies, it\u2019s fine. Your argument here holds no merit.\n\nEdit: a quick search says it\u2019s also illegal in Canada for children to go into dispensaries.", "I'd be willing to bet OP is from the UK, not the US. Idrk why I say that, it's just a kind of intuition about the way they're speaking and some of the cultural clues. That said I could also be completely wrong, it's just a hunch", "That is so cool! We usually just bring a pizza or chicken wings and snacks to eat. It would be really nice to be able to just get food there.", "She had plenty of time according to her original post to up and move the minute the first child sat down. They didn't have to say anything to the other group. They could have just stood up and found another place. Instead, she confronted them and was rude.", "Probably parents trying to give their teens alcohol so it's not a novelty or similar", "No idea. It's just what the posted policy is.", "So if you had known they had kids before they sat down, you would have moved. But the minute they came over instead of you getting up immediately, you chose to make a scene with them. They up and move to get away from you so as the issue did not continue.", "Again why couldn't you move after", "What time of the day was it?\n\nEspecially given that there were other seats, YTA absent some other practical information that they should not have brought kids aside from your opinion.", "So you specifically have these get togethers for \u201cadult time\u201d and yet didn\u2019t vet the venue as \u201cadult only\u201d?  Why not?", "It doesn't change anything. You're entitled, rude, and embarrassing. I feel sorry for your friends.", "I live in Denver.  So many breweries here.  There are kids at all of them all the time.  (So are dogs.  They don't serve dog food either.)  It's not a big deal. Personally, I think it's nice that parents have somewhere they feel welcome (hopefully) and where they aren't slamming shots or something like that.  To your point about alcohol not being available, it's the same for kids.  Do I prefer them to not be around....eh, maybe.  But I'm not going to let it ruin my experience.", "JFC why are so many people being purposely obtuse to justify their hatred of kids?", "As OP pointed out, that was not the case in this instance.", "That is because no one said it.

But ok.", "\">that doesn't mean you (every time you were an employee and not management with that kind of authority) or another patron has a right to be rude or to force people with children to move tables or leave the establishment. \"", "I meant as a patron.

LoL I am too old to deal with large drunken toddlers (adults).", "Now answer the second part, were there any signs that said no one under 21?", "So when did you look at your husband and make a comment? And when did you confront her because you were \u201cpretty upset\u201d?", "Then why are you even mad the problem resolved itself", "Illegal in bars too but call yourself a brewery and boom look at all that extra revenue.", "This is what you choose to respond to? Lol", "i agree OP & her friends should have been the ones to move since they had already said the table was open. but i also understand why they wouldn't have expected kids to be present at a place like that. it certainly doesn't sound like a place for kids, even though management allows it.", "Absolutely. We would have moved 100%. And I made no scene, I literally just said it would have been nice to know that their group had kids so we could move tables. That was all.", "Because it's a taproom! Most of those places are adult only or have designated family areas for people with kids. This is a new taproom that opened last year and we did not know they didn't have a family area. They don't exactly advertise that they are family friendly or have family areas until you actually get to the place and see it yourself.", "You're the one suggesting a preposterous thing! Why are you so obtuse to reality??? There ARE places children are NOT allowed, and it's perfectly reasonable to assume an establishment that ONLY serves ALCOHOL is one of those places.", "I don\u2019t hate kids, I hate parents who think the world revolves around their life choices.", "Yeah who goes to a brewer for that? People go for good beer and to hang", "No. And I did not mean to ignore that. Which is again why we would have moved if we knew they were brining a large group with kids. I apologize for not answering.", "You made a scene with these other people. You were rude. For no reason. She was under 0 obligation to tell you that she had children with her. The minute the 1st child came over, you had time to get up and leave. It wasn't until the rest of the group showed up with kids that you made a rude comment to her. You also keep avoiding my question. Are there any signs that state that no one under 21 is allowed?", "I think the right thing to do would have just been to move without saying anything. I know you said you would have but they moved first, but basically what you said to her was a rude way to ask her to move. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a major AH by any means, but soft YTA for not just moving if there were in fact plenty of other open tables for groups in the taproom like you said and a crowd you didn\u2019t want to be around sat down next to you when it\u2019s open seating.", "You didn\u2019t inquire?  All of the taprooms I\u2019m familiar with are open to the entire public.  They simply don\u2019t SERVE to minors.  It sounds like what you and your friends should have done is gone to a BAR.  I\u2019m not going to render a judgement as far as being as \u201casshole\u201d or not, but you are certainly ill prepared for going out in public.", "Yeah, why would a parent want to do that? That would be so boring for kids.", "It might be perfectly reasonable to assume children aren\u2019t allowed. It\u2019s just too bad that a reasonable assumption can still be wrong\u2026 like this one.", "Yeah seriously. People cannot take their kids wherever they want to go. Several types of businesses have age restrictions. Quite a few regular restaurants do not allow children.", "Taking your kids somewhere they are allowed to be isn't thinking the world revolves around them and their choices...", "This reads much more like you expect other people to accommodate around your preferences", "Yet even in your answer, you ignore it. So that tells me that children are allowed there. Which means you really had no ground to stand on when you complained.", "OP states this particular brewery sells no food or non-alcoholic beverages, only beer.", "They serve only beer and water. Why would you take a child there?", "So what you\u2019re saying is if the establishment allows it, then it\u2019s fine right?"]}
