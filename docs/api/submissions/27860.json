She said it was the medicines and the doctor that treated her and not me. I didn't argue.\n\nWhen the wedding date was fixed I told her that I am not coming. She was surprised and asked me why, and I told her that I have better things to do with my time than attending weddings of people like her.\n\nShe got mad and asked me what my problem was, and that she wants everyone to be present. She asked me to not insult her. I told her that she herself had insulted me by brushing away every thing I did for her, and that she's extremely ungrateful for not helping me with money when she could have. I told her I hadn't even asked her back the money I had spent on her, but she had no humanity at all.\n\nWe had an argument and everyone asked me to forget about she said and to attend.

People keep saying she has money because she is having a wedding.  We'll first of all, no that isn't true.  It is quite common for parents to pay for weddings.  Secondly even if she could afford a wedding, that doesn't mean she has money beyond that.  Or simply it could be the husband who paid for it. \n\nPeople also getting upset because she said \"not to ask again\".  Uh what?  If she doesn't have the money, she doesn't have the money.  He clearly kept asking her over and over.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not making any judgment because there is a lack of facts.\n\nIt certainly isn't as straight forward N T A as some as making out to be.  Why are we glossing over that he gifted her that money, but now he is holding it over her head?  That he claims to have cured her?

It was also kind of sucky that she wouldn't help you at all (even a partial amount if she couldn't fully give what you were asking).\n\nHowever, what makes me feel that you are the AH too is the way you seem to be dangling what you did for her over her head. She told you she wouldn't give you money and not to ask again (which was an AH move of her for sure), but you were the one who kept asking when you already knew the answer.\n\n>I was shocked considering how much I had spent for her\n\n>when she continued to refuse I asked her whether she had forgotten what I had done for her\n\n>I told her I hadn't even asked her back the money I had spent on her\n\nWhy did you pay for her treatment?

Or a loan?\n\nIf you're just going to hold what you did over her head and act as if that money is owed to you, then that makes you the AH too. \n\nYou both screwed up and it might help to actually talk with each other about why you are hurt and if you truly expect any repayment from her in the future.", "Info: did you say that you cured her depression? Did you use that phrasing specifically?", "I might be the odd man out on this one, and possibly a little biased because I have been in her shoes as far as depression. But please hear me out.\n\nWhen you asked her for money, did she just say no just to be mean, or did she really not have it and was embarrassed and so responded that way?\n\nShe \\*might\\* have thought your reaction was a little over the top if it is in fact the case that she didn't have the money to give and was embarrassed about it, One thing she is actually right about, it was the doctors and medicines that \\*helped\\* her (NOT cured, you can't just \"cure\" depression), BUT you ARE the one that paid for that treatment.\n\nI feel like there might be more to it on her side than we are reading here. Like, why on earth would she just choose rudeness regardless of all the help she received from you? Did you even ask her why she wouldn't help you? I know she said not to bother her about it again, but the problem there is you listened to her and just up and decided not to attend her wedding, instead of getting to the root of the problem. This might not be a case of ingratitude at all if you were to have a conversation with her about it.\n\nIf it were me and I were in your shoes, I would've asked my sister why she couldn't help me out, WITHOUT bringing up the fact that I helped her before, because that's not a great way to get a conversation going in my experience. \"I helped you, so now you have to help me.\" I don't understand that mindset. This could just be a thing for my family specifically, but we are all givers, and don't expect a return, but everyone knows if they need help they are free to ask, and anyone that says no is respected for their answer because there could be a reason for the no. We are all very close. I do know that not everyone is as fortunate as us in that aspect, so I'm trying to keep perspective here while offering some alternative viewpoints.\n\nThis is what I ultimately think: There are two possible outcomes here.\n\nEither A) There's more to this and you need to talk to her instead of just not showing up to the most important day of her life.\n\nOr B) She really is just being a huge AH and doesn't care at all how much you helped her and loves you because of what you can give her, not because you're her brother.\n\nEither way, I really do think this warrants further conversation and you have to get to the bottom of it. It seemed so out of place for her to just say \"don't bother me about it again\". Like there's no precedent for that (that you have mentioned) so I feel like a conversation is necessary and needed.

Just added that the parents paid for it.", "Pretty common for parents to pay for medical treatment, as well.", "Paying $15,000+ and then asking for $600 in a time in need is a FAR cry from \"paying me back.\"   There is an expectation of quid pro quo of family assistance.  Sister is an asshole.", "She still would cos she rejected him regardless", "I don't have a crystal ball, so no, I don't know how moochy she was when she was 8. The implication I got from OP's perspective is that he supported his sister over an extended period of time with a significant amount of money, and was shut down rudely over one request for reciprocal help. \n\nInferring that OP is leaving out information that would damage his case is a common style of responding to these, so fair enough, but I didn't go that route this time.", "Isn't it just as a whole a US cultural thing? It seems to breed this very high individualism way of thinking where you cannot seem to improve your own society because so many people can't accept anything that doesn't directly benefit them.", "Just because he needed help after helping her doesn\u2019t mean he was trying to use her?? Wtf? I have also dropped people out of my life once I realized that I\u2019m willing to help them out but they aren\u2019t willing to reciprocate. It has nothing to do with using people or leveraging your help over them, and everything to do with caring about people who don\u2019t care about you. This comment is gross.", "Its not about the money, its about refusing to return the help when you have benefited so much. \n\n\nThis could be like if I helped by friend move a whole house and then when I ask him to come move a table he doesn't just refuse but refused to do any labor in the future. Or I give my friends rides around town for months and when I need a ride to the airport they say don't ask me for a ride. Or I loan them a few hundred dollars and then they refuse to spot me $20 for lunch and say its my problem not theirs. \n\n\nDismissing and minimalizing the help received and refusing the return the favor makes her the AH and he is NTA to no have any association with a dead beat.", "And if there\u2019s ever an unforeseen reason why you can\u2019t afford or use private health care then there\u2019s free and low cost options to fall back on.", "What!

Did either of them actively fight to privatize healthcare and destroy OHIP?", "Which is absurd, because many of seeking diagnosis were diagnosed with HFA or Aspergers as kids, which barred us from the ADHD diagnosis.

Seven years seems wildly unlikely without other issues coming into play - or of course it could be totally made up.", "There is a backlog and my daughter was told it would be about 18 months for a LA diagnosis.

We've been told (as parents) that ot can take up to 3 years but it's all dependent on where you live etc", "I have no idea. I just read it two days ago in the ADHD UK sub. People said it was where they lived specifically that was so backed up, but many other commenters said it's normal to have to wait years for a dx. Just crazy to me. My son had to see many specialists when he was a baby and it was so difficult even having to wait a few weeks for a specialist. Years wait for anything is just awful either way.", ">it's still infintely better than the American system.\n\nA friend of mine in California was in a car accident recently, and had to have the three middle fingers of his left hand amputated.

That's not easier, it's harder.\n\nThat would mean that instead of having disposable income to fix the problem, they actively went into debt for their family member.", "In most countries, it's pretty uncommon for medical treatment to cost over $15,000 out of your *siblings* pocket.", "Seriously!!!!", "Yes the amounts are different, so are their abilities to pay. 2 years ago op was in a position of financial stability to loan out 15k with no plan of repayment, while sister was going into debt. Why do we just assume that ops sister, who took on debt and is just getting back on her feet, is in such a good position she can just hand out 600$? Because op thinks she does?

To the 111 first responder who listened to what my fiancee was saying and understood very quickly that I was dying. To the ambulance crew who got me to hospital quickly, smoothly and safely. To the ER nurses and doctors who dragged me back from the brink. And to the ward team and the consultants... all of whom treated me with urgency, dignity and respect. You saved my life almost exactly a year ago today.", "Everyone knows it\u2019s harder.  Tf kind of point do you think you are making?", "Not sure why you think me asking about it being charged on a credit card insinuates that it was easier.  You don\u2019t even think it\u2019s easier, why do you assume I do?", "Interesting, for me that does the opposite. Op makes this sound like one interaction, but to me saying don't ask again implies that it's not the first time, that op has already recieved that answer and is asking again. Usually you don't tell someone to stop doing something unless you expect them to do it again because it's a pattern of behavior.\n\nGranted I don't know if op has said they're not a native English speaker or not, that would change things.

I transferred to USA as my child had intractable epilepsy and needed brain surgery and was told by Neuro overseas that USA has so much more surgical experience for epilepsy surgery.
