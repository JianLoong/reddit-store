Protect your son, and leave the choice with him - exactly as you have done. The fact that your ex-MIL thinks you should force him to talk to people who he doesn't want to talk to shows that she doesn't have his best interests at heart, just as much as the fact that she apparently had no problem with the arrangement for 14 years.", "NTA - he\u2019s old enough to choose .. as he gets older he might choose to approach them himself (or not ).. but you are giving him the power of agency to make that choice himself and not when they dictate.. it\u2019s healthy and a good decision..", "NTA!\n\n1) because of privacy! Your son can decide who gets his contact information! There's no conflict needed for it to be evident that you ask him first. No is no.\n\n2) he's old enough to know he doesn't want more of their bullshit.\n\n even if he wasn't old enough to make such a decision: he's  definitely old enough to make his own mistakes. Nobody gets to decide for him", "NTA\n\nDon't do what would harm your son, but might be he has a few choice words for his grandmother\\^\\^", "NTA.  He\u2019s definitely old enough to make that decision.  And he always has the option of changing his mine and contacting them - it\u2019s not like this is some once in a lifetime opportunity for him to meet them.\n\nIf his paternal family wanted to have a relationship with him while he was still a child, they had all the info they needed to do that.  They chose not to, and they\u2019re reaping the consequences of their inaction.", "NTA. In a year or less, he will be a legal adult and decision not one you could or should force on him. Tell her he has her number and he's old enough to know whether he wants to use it.\n\nAnd why after a decade, is his dad keen to contact? Is it because he no longer needs to worry about financial responsibility and because your son no longer protected by courts? If ex-MiL not in picture before, then suspect this is your ex using her as go-between.", "NTA. I'm glad he sees them for what they are.\n\n>My Ex MIL disagrees\n\nSo what? She's not been anyone to him.

It\u2019s very much your son\u2019s choice. You can\u2019t \u201cget him on the phone\u201d anyway. Plus, I\u2019d be very suspicious that the MIL has ignored you for years - I wonder if this is a ploy by your ex-husband to get in contact with his son. Keep well clear!", "NTA, you\u2019re a wonderful mom for protecting your son and giving him a choice", "NTA\nYou sound like an awesome mom! Good on you for having the strength to leave!\nYou are absolutely NOT the asshole.\n\nThis is very simple: You asked your son, and he said no. He doesn't have to give reasons, doesn't HAVE to give them a \"2nd\" chance. That is purely his decision.  If he's old enough to decide to enter college, he's old enough to decide who he wants in his life.\n\nBesides, if ex-MIL wanted a relationship, she wouldn't have disappeared and presumedly took her drug-dealing son's side. (Also where was she when he was harrassing you?)\n\nI would honestly ask her why she waited til now.\n\nAlternatively, if she continues nagging, you can ask him to get on the phone and tell her himself.\nDoesn't need to be long, it can be short 'n brutal:\n\"Hi (name), I don't want you in my life.\"\n\nNot much she could argue about if it comes directly from him. This would be a delicious bit of malicious compliance in the end.\n\nEither way, I hope they leave you alone.", "NTA for not giving out his contact information. YWBTA if you give out his info without his consent.", "NTA. It's reasonable to ask you to give your son his grandmother's contact info for when/if he is ever ready to learn more about that half of his genetics/family. \n\nIt is NOT reasonable to demand his contact info when he doesn't want to give it, especially when she has made no effort for his entire childhood.", "nta. he specifically said he wanted nothing to do with that side of the family. i would tell ex MIL that if and when he\u2019s ready he will reach out on his own or not. the balls in his court and leave it at that.", "NTA. Your son has spoken so that should be it. Obviously he is an intelligent young man and knows what he wants.", "NTA. Grandmother cut off her grandson first to choose her drug addict son over him. No sympathy. She could also just be trying to use your son to talk to his father. Protect your son.", "NTA.  Tell ex Mil he knows how to contact them and if he wants to will.", "Def NTA. You and his stepfather have done a great job raising a responsible, stable young man.\n\nAnd THAT is one of the reasons your ex MIL *now* wants a relationship. Your son is smart, has it together, and is headed to college.\n\nShe wants to show him off as the grandson who is a success, and will continue to be a grandson to brag about...although they offered no help/support in raising him.", "NTA \n\nYour ex MIL has 0 rights to your son let alone decide what he's old enough for. \n\nYour son said NO.  NO is a complete sentence and he's absolutely old enough to decide that.", "NTA - They have had years to try and establish a relationship with him. They chose not to. Now your son is old enough to make his own choices and he is not interested in them. That is the consequence of their actions.", "NTA good job in allowing your son to have a choice but maybe suggest to him to at least meet his grandma once and see if he likes it but of course dont force. at the end of the day it is his choice", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
