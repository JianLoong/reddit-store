Let\u2019s call her Aspen. I work for the family full time Monday-Friday and last week there really was no mention of her birthday coming up or any plans regarding it. On Friday her mom came home with a couple of balloons and said they were having small get together over the weekend for Aspen\u2019s birthday. She didn\u2019t invite me, which was totally fine because I didn\u2019t really want to spend one of my days off over there socializing with them. Everything was cool was I left on Friday, we exchanged goodbyes, and that was that.\n\nMonday arrives and I come to work and all is fine and well. That evening when I\u2019m getting off Aspen\u2019s mom asks if she could talk to me for a sec. She then proceeds to tell me that she was disappointed that I didn\u2019t have a gift for Aspen on Friday or Monday. I was a bit taken aback and said that I didn\u2019t know that was an expectation. She then said while it wasn\u2019t an expectation she thought that me not having a gift shows that I\u2019m not really connected with her child. I then explained to her that I\u2019m on a pretty tight budget because of my life circumstances and I\u2019m starting grad school in May so saving every extra penny I have is important to me. After that she said that she pays me well enough that I could have gotten her daughter something\u2026.I apologize and explained that my priority was taking care of her daughter and fostering her growth while I\u2019m there but I didn\u2019t think that I had to spend money on her.\n\nShe got a bit red in the face and told me that I didn\u2019t need to bother coming back. I asked her if this was based on my overall performance or the fact that I didn\u2019t buy Aspen a gift and she said that she was happy with my performance but that clearly I wasn\u2019t caring or thoughtful because I didn\u2019t get a gift. I knew she was happy with my performance based on past texts and comments but I really just wanted her to clarify because I was so shocked that she just went straight to firing me.\n\nThat was Monday and I\u2019m still a bit pissed off about it. Aspen and her family are wealthy and privileged and live in a million dollar home in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in my city. It seems a bit ridiculous to expect your nanny to come out of pocket when you can literally give your child everything and then some. It\u2019s not like I make 6 figures or anything.

Don't let some other undeserving person be subject to their entitlement.", "NTA. You aren't a friend or relative, you are a paid employee. It's not the norm to do gifts in the workplace.\n\nSo MAYBE if the child was say 5, and asked you what you were getting them, and was old enough to understand... MAYBE then you get something very small like a trinket you know they would like. But that is only because of your connection to the child. At 1 that baby has no idea who got them what or why.\n\nThis is new parent, world revolves around my baby vanity. Then the mom felt shamed hearing your financial situation and got defensive. \n\nGet it in writing and formally you have been terminated and why so you can collect unemployment (assuming it's possible) and to establish credibility as you look for a new job.

I\u2019m trying to figure out what the mother\u2019s perspective could be here. I agree that she may be too rich to be in touch, and I agree you should treat it like any other job, but I think most parents do NOT think of the people who provide their children care as any other employee. While this may not be a realistic expectation on her part, it sounds like she was communicating that she interpreted you NOT getting her child a gift as a sign you did not care for/ love her child enough. \n\nAgain, not saying you need to love the child you are paid to care for OR that not buying a gift means you don\u2019t love her\u2026. Just that this seems to have been the mother\u2019s assumption and concern. \n\nI agree with the many posters who say you are better off without this employer. I agree that NOT spending your hard earned money on your job is the right thing to do. You are not in the wrong here. \n\nYou did indicate that you wanted to understand what happened here, and I think what happened is mom interpreted you not getting her child a gift as you not loving the child. To her this is not any job, or any child, this is her precious child and if you aren\u2019t so head over heels in love with the child that you don\u2019t sacrifice your hard earned cash to get her a gift, then you must not love her enough. If you don\u2019t love her enough to buy a gift, how can you love her enough to take proper care of her ?
