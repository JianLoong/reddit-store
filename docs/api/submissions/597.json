You're nursing TWO kids, right?\n\nYour body did its best during pregnancy, and you have the newborn, and also a toddler.\n\nIt's not like you spend 30 minutes watching a show and neglected your children. Your body just gave up.\n\nI'm sure he's also overwhelmed and on his limit. That happens.\n\nDon't see any assholes, just exhausted parents.\n\nYou didn't do it on purpose. Your body literally decided you need a break. Give him one when you can. Get a babysitter for 2h sleep today if you can.\n\nIt's going to get better. I promise.", "NAH Out of an abundance of compassion.\n\nThis is such a hard time for parents, two little ones needing a lot of attention.  It's a accident of the most inconvenient sort that hubby felt at wits end and asked for help right when you get stomach cramps and nausea.  None of it was intended.  I can see someone trying to blame him as having the \"lighter\" job or you blaming yourself for not being able to step up, but try to love each other up through this as patiently as possible and not fall into the false bullying and blame society loves.  \n\nDon't so much apologise as commiserate -- can this be a lighter day in some way? Mental health day for whomever is working? Cancel chores except feeding and resting?  MAke a pact for mutual care and refuse to blame each other.\n\nReddit -- circle these poor parents with love and send them energy.

Can you load the kids up in the car and go somewhere for a couple hours so he can have some time? I'm in a very similar situation and sometimes I just load the kids up and drive around (if they fall asleep bonus points) but I can listen to music and the can look at things and my partner can get a little bit to himself. He does similar stuff for me and it works.", "NTA he needs to suck it up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it is your responsibility to manage known risks to your health. No one forces you to put the food in your mouth. Your choice, your consequences.\n\nBeing a little unfair perhaps, you've also decided to have 2 children close together. That has consequences too...\n\nAside from that, no one is the asshole here. You're both struggling to deal with things.\n\nTime to raise the flag and ask for help.\n\nDo you have family and friends that can offer some support to relieve the pressure?"]}
