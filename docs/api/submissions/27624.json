Sometime last year, they got pregnant but it unfortunately ended in a miscarriage a week or two after they found out. As we don\u2019t talk much outside of family gatherings, we found out about the miscarriage from their mom a few weeks later. They never told us directly, so we never reached out to them to say anything about it. \nAt family functions when we\u2019re all sort of forced to be together, there is nothing more than \u201cHi\u2019s\u201d and \u201cBye\u2019s\u201d said between us all, and even that is touch and go sometimes; but we overheard that they have been trying again for the past 6 months to get pregnant again. \n\nWell unexpectedly and very unplanned, I found out I\u2019m pregnant some time ago. I\u2019m about 10 weeks now and we pretty much have no intention of telling them about our pregnancy, we know they will find out on socials but we don\u2019t feel the need, nor really even want to, reach out directly to tell them our pregnancy news, as we really don\u2019t know how they would react, especially since they lost theirs less than a year ago. I obviously don\u2019t want to be insensitive to their situation or to their feelings, but there has been so much past tension/drama to the point where I don\u2019t feel obligated to tell them anything about our lives, especially since they make it a point to keep us out of theirs (ie. we were not invited to their wedding, we weren\u2019t told they were even pregnant or that it ended in miscarriage)\n\nAITA for not telling them at all and just waiting till they find out on social media like everyone else?\n\nUpdate: For added context, my husband was invited to the wedding, was originally intended to be the best man, I was uninvited due to fear from the Bride of \u201cbeing upstaged at her own wedding\u201d this was said directly from his brother to us, so naturally my husband said he will not be going and his invitation was taken away. (My husband and I are professional models, and his brother\u2019s bride is a very insecure person and was a major bride-zilla)", "created_utc": 1695673384, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16s2tgc/aita_for_not_telling_sibling_in_laws_im_pregnant/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you're not close enough to attend their wedding, you're surely not close enough to disclose your pg.\n\nHowever, I *might* have your husband tell your MIL (or FIL, whomever is closest to the twin) so they can let the twin know (BEFORE you post anything). \n\nI think that is more gracious and respectful than them coming across it over social media.\n\nCongratulations and best of luck!", "NTA\n\nYou weren't invited to their wedding and they hadn't told you about their pregnancy, you don't have a close relationship and I don't see anything weird about you not telling them about your pregnancy.", "NTA.  They obviously do not care about you (no wedding invite, no info on their pregnancy) so there is absolutely no reason to put them on the distribution list for updates on your life and life events.  Information will eventually make their way to them, but again this is not your concern.", "NTA\n\nIf you don't really have a relationship with them why should you share everything with them? It's sound like they are related strangers somehow.", "NTA - if you didn't attend their wedding, and your interactions with them are already tenuous, you shouldn't feel obligated to tell them about your pregnancy. You SHOULD tell the parents-in-law first before social media, and if they tell the sibling, then so be it, but no - YWNBTA for not telling them first. Doing a social media announcement has become more and more common.", "NTA, you aren't involved in their life's so they don't have a right to be told. They didn't tell you, and you guys didn't even get an invite to their wedding. You can literally wait until the baby is a year old to tell whoever you want to tell. At the end of the day it's up to you. Good luck baby momma", "NTA you guys don't have a relationship so no you really do not have to reach out. It's your choice if you want it to be on social media or kept private. I don't think there's anything wrong with it.", "Your husband owes it to his twin to give a heads up at 13 weeks before some general social media announcement.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a life altering convo, just, \"Hey, wanted you to hear before everyone that OP is pregnant.\" That's it. Short and sweet.", "NTA. You don't need to inform people who you are not close to of anything.", "NTA...you're not obligated to share anything. They clearly didn't share with you.", "You are not in contact otherwise, so no reason to specifically reach out about your pregnancy. (I would, however, have sent a condolence note when I learned of their miscarriage.) \n\nNAH", "NTA - It's your pregnancy, you aren't obligated to tell anyone if you don't want to. If they've made it a point to keep y'all out of their life, then it shouldn't affect them if you don't tell them directly. They can find out like everyone else on social media. \n\nMy best friend is my brother and I found out he was having his firstborn through social media. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It was no biggie to me. I was just happy regardless of wherever I heard the news.", "NTA - You don\u2019t owe an announcement to anyone.", "NTA. Why would you share your news with people you have no relationship with? Have a safe and healthy pregnancy, and continue to stay low/no contact with people bring nothing but stress and drama.", "Not sure if you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t tell\nThem. but I would let someone in the family know ahead of time so they have a chance to process before seeing on Socials.", "These people don't include you in any life events/announcements of theirs and you have no obligation to include them in yours. Nice that you're thinking about it given the sensitivity but that's about as far as you need go. WNBTA", "NTA,  but you might ask a family member to tactfully mention it to them in private so they don\u2019t find out at a family gathering or in a situation where they\u2019re surrounded by people. They may need time to process the news.", "NAH. They clearly don\u2019t want you involved in their lives. Seems like that bothers you, but I can tell if either of you are AH\u2019s without knowing the root of the estrangement. \n\nAlso, to me the bigger issue is the not being invited to their wedding. That\u2019s a pretty clear indication that you are not important to them. A lot of people don\u2019t share pregnancy/miscarriage news with others, even if they are close.", "Are you the bad guy for not spilling the pregnancy beans to your drama-prone sibling-in-law? No, darling, you're not. They never told you about their miscarriage directly, so why should you play messenger pigeon?\n\nWith past tension and them keeping you at arm's length, it's perfectly reasonable not to feel obligated to share your life updates. As for their reaction, that's their business, not yours. Drama is their game, and you're not obliged to play.\n\nIn the grand scheme of family theatrics, this is just another act. Focus on your pregnancy, let them find out on social media, and keep that self-preservation intact.", "NTA You have e very little contact with them, no point in telling  them", "NTA\n\nIf you are out of their lives to the extent of not being invited to their wedding they would probably interpret reaching out as rubbing their nose in it.", "I would act gracefull and better. \nBefor the fb announcement your hub send his twin a personal message, so he knew before the official announcement,  but tell no more, except they ask kindly.", "INFO - is your husband on board with this?\n\nI think his stance matters a lot because it's his twin brother.", "[deleted]", "YTA Your indifference towards their pain and loss is callous. Even if you don't have the best relationship, showing some basic human compassion wouldn't hurt. They lost a child, and you're knowingly keeping your pregnancy a secret, essentially rubbing it in their faces when they find out on social media.", "Do people who lost a fetus expect the world to stop procreating?", "~~YTA~~ NTA (Due to more information being provided) Maybe she was early in her pregnancy when she had her miscarriage, which is why they didn't tell anyone she was pregnant. Many people don't disclose the news until after 12 weeks. There's no reason you HAD to know she had a miscarriage. That's really none of your business, now, is it?\n\nI think you're being petty because you weren't invited to their wedding. Was it an elopement?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s really awful that you were excluded from a family event due to their inability to see you beyond your looks.

I didn\u2019t tell my in-laws until I was 7mo pregnant.", "NTA", "Giving the heads up through your MIL/FIL is a great solution that also respects the fact they never directly told you their own situation.", "My husband was invited, he was actually supposed to be his best man at the wedding, but his bride asked me not to come, out of fear of \u201cbeing upstaged at her own wedding\u201d . My husband and I are professional models and she was, and still quite honestly is, a very insecure person and my husbands twin brother unfortunately sided with her, despite the rest of his family warning him this would be a horrible idea. We\u2019re thinking this is the best way to go, having my MIL tell them the news, as after this was told to us by his twin brother directly, we don\u2019t feel the need to keep communication between us anymore.", "XD I try to figure out what YWNBTA means. What does it mean", "That's a very considerate idea that doesn't take any extra effort. Very good suggestion.", "I agree with you that my husband should be the one to reach out to his brother separately and just tell him, thank you for this advice! :)", "If your friend of a friend had a miscarriage would you feel obligated to tell them that you were having a baby? No? Good they don\u2019t need to tell them either. \n\nOP was not informed by BIL about the miscarriage, nor was OP invited to their wedding. OP not obligated to inform them, morally or otherwise.", "but the odds of it being taken as \"rubbing it in their faces\" if they **DO** tell them seems quite high tbh", "It's not her fault they lost a baby, nor do they have to tell them? The brother didn't tell them so why should she tell the brother.", "Wouldn\u2019t be rubbing it in their faces, we don\u2019t even follow each other on social media. We are truthfully terrified to tell them our of fear of past interactions with them, when my husband told his twin we decided to get married, his brother got aggressively upset and even went as far as saying my husband shouldn\u2019t marry me. Not sure if it matters but all my husband\u2019s family & their SO are white, I am the only Mexican in the family also. Never had issues getting along with any of his other family, just his twin as he is a very stubborn and aggressive person, hence why we keep our distance, among other reasons\u2026", "so technically the same argument could be said that there\u2019s no reason WE have to tell them either correct? It should also be mentioned, he has another brother who they did tell about the pregnancy/miscarriage, we were the only ones in the family to not know. We are not petty in the slightest, it was a very large wedding (300+ guests) in which my husband was intended to be the best man at first, but we were uninvited due to jealousy on their side. My husband and I are professionals models and we were told we were uninvited out of fear we would \u201cupstage\u201d them at their own wedding. These were the direct words his brother told us as his bride was very insecure, and quite honestly still is to this day. While this drama was all happening, we still made it a point to invite them to our wedding and our personal social gatherings, which they chose themselves to decline on their own. Our weddings were both quite close to one another (within the span of a few months) which was decided over a year in advance.", "I would also think this is the way - less hurtful to them than being surprised on socials but still doesn\u2019t require you to either talk to them directly about the news or hear any backlash they feel.", "You will (or would) not be the asshole.", "Yes, the same argument could be made. You left out a LOT of information in your post about why you weren't invited to the wedding, about who they told and didn't tell.  SO I'll change my vote. But you should update your post.", "This has been ongoing drama that\u2019s taken place over the span of 2 years, there\u2019s so much context and things that have happened in between, that for lack of time and character space I wasn\u2019t able to mention, so i decided to keep it short and simple but you\u2019re right there is much that is missing, but after so long it\u2019s a bit hard to hold on to every single fact, we are just working on moving on and letting it all go for respect for our own mental health at this point"]}
