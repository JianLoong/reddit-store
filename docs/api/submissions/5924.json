What kind of servant/slave inferiority complex is that?!", "\"unsalvageable\" is also the word I had in mind", "NTA\n\nSince the day he married you, YOU became his immediate family. YOU are on top of his priorities NOT his momma, NOT his sisters. YOU. He, his mom and siblings should be ashamed of letting you celebrate Christmas alone.\n\nYour husband and his side of the family are the assholes here. They should know better.", "Yep, I'd make sure his next plane ticket is a one way.", "\u266c*sweet hooome alabama*\u266c", "I'm not even blind (although I have absolutely awful eyesight, as long as I have my glasses/contacts I can manage) but sound doesn't rouse me all the time, so I have my phone and my Samsung watch that does vibration with the sound on my alarms. And I say alarms because I have 3 of them set for a 15 minute period for when I *need* to get up... And I still have wake up and time to get tog.he bus alarms for my 2 school aged children still at home (one high school and one elementary student). No way I could manage my life/my kids lives in the morning, without multiple alarms with sound and vibration!!! Lol", "Excellent response, excellent advice and thank you. To be clear I am not married and never will be, this is just a super interesting fact! Your follow up comment is even more interesting. Thank you fellow Redditor!", "See, that's teamwork.", "I thought for sure. This was going to be a. Prefight night before as in op reminding spouse to set alarm, or spouse was hungover. So op choose not to wake because it was his fault.  Then to find out she was sleeping.  So totally NTA. Let him give the silent treatment. Better than listening to him whine", "You're not the asshole.\n\nHave you considered throwing out the whole man, though?", "Wait, he was mad YOU didn't wake HIM up so he could leave you for the holidays?\n\nYea NTA. But wondering why you're with him still?", "NTA. Its not your responsibility to make sure he gets to the airport on time. Hes a grown man he can set his own alam and make sure he gets himself where he needs to be. I think you're the scapegoat for his short comings", "Reading is hard isn't it? She said he had to wake up early and hence she was *surprise surprise* still asleep because she's not a living alarm clock.\n\nAnd indeed couples do things for eachother like stand up for one another and not abandon eachother. OPs husband did neither.", "Would he count this as \"an electronic\"? lol", "respect is earned and it can be lost", "If/when they have kids, the in laws will be absolute nightmares and \"Al\" will never stick up for his wife. OP run! NTA", "my partner and i don't have kids. his family does christmas every year; mine doesn't because we're jewish. he says because i don't do anything, he expects me to come with him to visit his family every year. i HATE christmas. i love spending it by myself. it's the one time of year i used to have to really be alone in a near empty city, have my chinese food, go to the movies, maybe hang with some other jewish friends or non-celebrators. i would love it if he did christmas without me -- i like his family a lot, but we see them lots of times throughout the year. so this really isn't one size fits all.\n\nthat said, the poster is NTA for not waking her husband, and his family sounds terrible. but she may not care about not spending xmas with them.", "Idk. Totally depends. Some people would rather not be at their ILs and would take the pass to stay behind whilst letting their partner see their family.", "My mom and dad had a rift with my mother\u2019s dad because he excluded my dad from holidays (mom\u2019s mom died on my parent\u2019s first anniversary). I didn\u2019t grow up with my maternal grandfather over it. My mom chose my dad over her father. I did grow up with my paternal grandparents. They treated my mother like their own daughter.", "Absolutely. I\u2019m Jewish and my husband is \u201cwhatever culture is serving food\u201d lol, but his family celebrates Christmas on the EVE and on the day. I don\u2019t go to both bc it\u2019s a lot for someone not into Christmas to do that much Christmas, and we\u2019re both ok with that set-up. He is fully supportive and knows that our traditions come first if they ever bump into each other. I also try to be reasonable and work around their traditions if I can. I also have a good relationship with his family even though early on I did have to draw some very firm boundaries by letting them know that my husbands role in his nuclear family trumps his role in his extended family. They were a bit resistant but my husband was not, and he 100% let them know who his loyalty is too. \n\nOP\u2019s husband is not even close to drawing boundaries bc he likes the royal treatment. The baby likes his bottle. OP, I\u2019m not sure how you let it get this carried away, but you are a victim of their emotional abuse/emotional incest. I\u2019m sorry you got caught up in it. It doesn\u2019t seem like your husband is willing to change. Miracles do happen, but that\u2019s what you\u2019d be banking on here. You deserve to be cherished. You deserve to be queen of your throne with your husband by your side as the King \u2014 NOT by his Mommy\u2019s side as her prince . \n\nNTA. Good luck", "He kinda already did. She wasn't invited to their Christmas celebration and rather than stay and celebrate with his wife he chose to leave her alone on Christmas to go be catered to by his family. He already chose his family over her and will continue to do so.", "This is the part that\u2019s burning me up. Such betrayal.", "Agree  he s an adult  he needs to take care of his sh!t alone. Nta op", "I\u2019m Jewish too and my husband gets to choose 1 of the 2 Christmas parties his Mom and Dad have - either Xmas Eve or Xmas day bc I\u2019m not accustomed to all that Xmas, and I too like that alone time. I love his family as well, and already see them regularly. They of course always ask me to come to both. This year, I actually did, and got to light my menorah with them. But they also are completely understanding of my limitations. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine not having a healthy relationship with my in-laws where they don\u2019t respect my and my husband\u2019s autonomy. Navigating cross-culturally is challenging enough as is, and to add conflict? I just couldn\u2019t. \n\nOP, honey, I want you to grow a big shiny spine and tell them all to act right or eff off. \n\nNTA", "She must get something. I don\u2019t think OP is do innocent. Seems like she already knew what she was getting into and married him anyway. Some people create their own misery", "You can just say ok Google/siri/Alexa wake me at 3am. Your phone will do the rest", "I was more responsible/mature then that at 10", "Yeah there must be some kind of manipulation going on here. Just to ask this question in the first place... what is this man doing to her?", "Shit it might just be his pheromones. Chemistry has led to me being a fucking dumb ass in the past", "I\u2019d be so proud of OP if she just owned it. \u201cNo, AH, I intentionally let you sleep bc IDGAF about you getting to your family that hates me, and I think you\u2019re an absolute dolt for believing that I\u2019d support your efforts by waking up to wake you up\u201d", "I've spent the holiday apart so I could stay home and work ~~and enjoy a kid free house~~ while my husband traveled to visit family. And he's had the same pleasure lol. But it's definitely mutually agreed to.", "My Mom can be tough. I'm also 100% sure her and my wife only get along as well as we do because I insert myself in the middle, on my wife's side, 90% of the time. The other 10%, when my wife tries to deal with her when I'm not there goes really, really badly. So many dudes \"stay out of it\" and then whine when their wives don't speak to their Moms anymore. You made your bed dude. \n\nEven on the rare occasion when my Mom is right, I'm on my wife's side. Mom, this is OUR (ridiculously stupid) boundary and it's not hard to not cross it. I may tell my wife in private that I don't think this hill is worth dying on, but if she wanted me to I would die on that hill. And either way I'd never gang up on her with my Mom.", "This is what I\u2019m dealing with currently. She\u2019s spoiled him so much he like expects special treatment from her. I raised my voice a bit at him a little over a week ago after he was on the phone with his mother, being a snotty shit to her when he\u2019s asking her to drop shit off to him \n\nI told him he should be fucking going to get it not making his aging mom walk down the street in the cold and snow, and how fucking dare he speak to his mother like that when she\u2019s always so kind to him. He went and got whatever it was.", "Yeah, regardless of her reasons to not wake him - she overslept, she\u2019s completely over his demands, and it\u2019s his responsibility - she did say she would and then didn\u2019t, which is, on its face, an AH thing to do. But, bc of the other factors, eff him and I don\u2019t blame OP for not giving AF if he makes it to Christmas without her. It was a very passive aggressive way to say IDGAF and I\u2019m done prioritizing your relationship with your Mom. I wish OP would just own it. I know if that was me, I\u2019d have told my husband to shove his alarm up his ass if he needs help waking up. Actually, I\u2019d have filed for divorce a long time ago.", "Nah. This is him hoping OP will eventually start treating him like mommy treats him to get in good with the family again. \u201cStaying out of it\u201d is just a passive aggressive game", "I would love to know that, as well. Sometimes we make mistakes and don't realize it until something like this happens."]}
