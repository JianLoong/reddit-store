Alexis has a 3 year old daughter, Millie. We are all on holiday at a resort, along with our parents and my brother Will. \n\nAlexis is one of those people who thinks their kid is everyone else\u2019s priority, and frequently tries to get other people to look after Millie so she can have some \u201cspace\u201d. Now, no issue with a parent needing space, but you can\u2019t take that space by forcing people to look after your kid. She always tries to guilt us into doing it, or she will say \u201cI\u2019m just going to the bathroom/fetching something quickly\u201d and disappear for ages. This morning, she tried that while she, Will, and I were at the pool. I said to her \u201cAlexis, you need to take Millie with you because we are not watching her. You are leaving her unsupervised\u201d but she ignored me, thinking we would just put up with it because we had no choice. \n\nThe second she was out of sight, Will and I got up and left the pool area. We went to get drinks and sat down elsewhere. After about twenty minutes there was a loud announcement made that Millie\u2019s parent needed to come and collect her from the lifeguard. When we met back up with Alexis she lost it on us, saying we endangered her child. I said she endangered her child, as she was told twice that we would not be watching her, and she obviously hadn\u2019t just gone to the bathroom because it was 20 minutes before she even came back. \n\nAlexis is still mad, and Mike is mad. My mother says Alexis should have been taking better care of Millie, but my stepfather says we shouldn\u2019t have left her like that, even if Alexis was wrong.

While I can definitely empathize with not wanting to be left responsible for someone else's kid, especially after specifically stating that you didn't want to watch her, it's never ok to leave 3 year old unattended near any body of water. I don't care if she can swim, had floaties, etc. She's a toddler and doesn't understand her own limitations when it comes to safety. \n\nIf you had simply watched her and then chewed your SIL out for leaving, I'd vote NTA, but you left a fucking baby at the pool by herself. \n\nIf the unthinkable had happened, you wouldn't even care about who was right or wrong, you'd be buying a tiny coffin. \n\nA conversation needs to be had with your SIL about who is and is not responsible for her kid, but I think you also need to know that there's a time and a place to make a point and doing something as dangerous as what you did is in no way acceptable.", "Jesus fuck ESH.\n\nOn one hand, your SIL is an ass (like a major flaming double fried asshole) for forcibly handing off responsibility of her child to others so that she can have space. On the other hand... WTH IS WRONG WITH YOU? There's a reason why Alexis thought that you would be 'forced' to take care of her child... because not doing so is literal child endangerment. Next time you want to prove a point, you shpuld leave before Alexis has a chance to.

Yeah, SIL is a self-entitled dumb ass, but what the hell was your thought process that told you abandoning her child was a good idea?  Please don\u2019t ever have children of your own, you have no business trying to be a parent.", "YTA. You endangered a 3 year old to make a point because you were annoyed? Thats fucked up man.

You shouldnt leave her in danger like that....", "ESH\n\nA 3yr old by a pool can easily drown.

Again, are you OK? Causing this, even if the mother should be doing better?\n\n The second Alexis said she was leaving you should have walked away. Before she could.

I 100% understand how infuriating it must be for Alexis to keep getting you to watch Millie, but the solutions here were;\n- Follow Alexis with Millie, hand her over and then leave\n- Stick it out by the pool and confront Alexis when she got back. \n- Bring Millie to the lifeguard straight away and get them to make an announcement \n\nThere was absolutely no way the solution was to leave the child unsupervised. *Ever.* \n\nIt isn\u2019t Millie\u2019s fault that the adults around her seem incapable of acting like adults.

A better choice would have been to take the child up to the room to her mother then leave.   Leaving a 3 year old at a pool unattended is really a ridiculous self centered thought.   Your SIL is also ridiculous for expecting others to watch her child on a vacation, but  endangering a child to point out how shitty of a mom she is not a valid move.", "ESH, but one of you is entitled and self centered, the other left a 3 year old unsupervised near a crowded pool.  Making a point can be done without putting a child's life in danger (you have no idea how fast a kid can slip under water and out of view).  \n\n\nAlexis is in the wrong, but holy crap, you guys were idiots.  \n\n\nNow, if you had moved out of the area so it appeared that Millie was unsupervised, while you covertly kept her in your sight the whole time, I would have less issue.

Alexis has a 3 year old daughter, Millie. We are all on holiday at a resort, along with our parents and my brother Will. \n\nAlexis is one of those people who thinks their kid is everyone else\u2019s priority, and frequently tries to get other people to look after Millie so she can have some \u201cspace\u201d.

She always tries to guilt us into doing it, or she will say \u201cI\u2019m just going to the bathroom/fetching something quickly\u201d and disappear for ages. This morning, she tried that while she, Will, and I were at the pool. I said to her \u201cAlexis, you need to take Millie with you because we are not watching her. You are leaving her unsupervised\u201d but she ignored me, thinking we would just put up with it because we had no choice. \n\nThe second she was out of sight, Will and I got up and left the pool area. We went to get drinks and sat down elsewhere. After about twenty minutes there was a loud announcement made that Millie\u2019s parent needed to come and collect her from the lifeguard. When we met back up with Alexis she lost it on us, saying we endangered her child. I said she endangered her child, as she was told twice that we would not be watching her, and she obviously hadn\u2019t just gone to the bathroom because it was 20 minutes before she even came back. \n\nAlexis is still mad, and Mike is mad.

They should have gotten up when Alexis did.", "Ok no one is disagreeing that the mother isn't a huge AH, but you still don't leave a young child unsupervised by a pool. Family or stranger, you don't do that. She should have taken the child to a staff member. If you saw a random child by the side of a highway or river alone, you'd just walk away because it's not your problem? YTA also.", "So if something horrible had happened you think it would be completely fine for OP to say \"yeah I was left to watch this child but I thought proving a point to her mom mattered more than her life\"?", "I hear you. But the child is innocent in this situation. Just be upfront with the mom. Don't risk a child's life", "Legally no. The OP is as responsible as a random person on the sidewalk that she just left her child with. The mom would be legally responsible", "That's ESH (everyone sucks here) (except the kid obviously) not YTA", "I think this is a pretty clear ESH. Or, at least, OP, Will, and Alexis are all assholes. Like, yeah, she should be taking better care of her daughter and not forcing her off on other people, but it was still wildly not okay to leave a three year old alone at the pool. Fucking wild of OP to do that.", "This is the way", "She wasn\u2019t in the pool. And her parent wasn\u2019t there, she\u2019d left and we didn\u2019t know to where.

That\u2019s not what lifeguards are for.", "Kids, especially three years old, do die even with lifeguards. Especially if the pool is busy.", "So the lifeguard was going to stop the 3 year old from being a human trafficking victim?", "Even if she didn't die and the lifeguard got there 'in time'. Water inhalation can cause damage by itself, dry drowning is a thing etc. Not to mention the risks of child abduction etc.\n\nChildren can and do die with lifeguards present, and as an ex lifeguard- people treating us like babysitters was one of the most frustrating things parents did- having to look after lost children puts others at risk.", "Kids still die in pools with lifeguards. Drowning is the #1 cause of death for a kid that age.", "so its okay to leave children to die?", "What a great attitude towards a child! Shame on you.", "I like this idea. Much safer way of teaching SIL \u201ca lesson\u201d. YTA all day for leaving a toddler alone at a resort pool.", "Agreed. This gets the same point across but without endangering the child. I felt sick reading this.", "If you wanted to prove your point, you should have taken the child out of the pool to the front desk.", "20 minutes to go to the bathroom is reasonable? I think not n", "Not Mike's  kid so Alexis probably doesn't have him tend to millie.", "While I agree with everything you said. She shouldn\u2019t have abandon the child, but take the kid to the lifeguard and say that this is an abandon child or some thing else or get a hotel authority figure. I would classify this as a ESH.", "They put a child in grave danger to win an argument. Definitely ESH. Drowning is the #1 cause of death for kids thar age. Would you say this to someone who left a kid in a hot car? Bc it\u2019s the same thing.", "Yeah, I doubt that.

I can't believe these people.", "There was a lifeguard.", "Seriously. What an idiot.", "She also could have gotten up and walked away when she realized mom was going to pull her usual stunt since they were obviously planning to leave the area anyway.", "This!", "We told her we wouldn\u2019t be watching.

Boys are victims of SA too.", "Ah, yes because a male toddler is in such a better position.", "yea no leaving a child in a potentially dangerous situation like this is disgusting, i could never purposefully leave a child by a pool bc all i could think was how high the potential for them to fall and drown. I hope no one ever leaves their children alone with you.", "Alexis, Millie is the daughter", "Yeah, i get that its annoying to be left with a kid all the time, but ffs, it really seemed like OP left her on purpose, since right after SIL left, she went to the bar", "do you really think that information is required to make a judgment here??", "She literally told us as she was leaving. By the time we\u2019d got our stuff together she was gone. But yeah, we probably should have just reported it to staff.", "We live in a society. You're telling me if you saw a child drowning in a pool, you'd shrug with a nonchalant \"not my circus\" and leave, huh?", "Dude I wouldn\u2019t let a strangers 3 y/o be left unattended at a pool. I guess some people just have VASTLY different morals.", "Not the same sort of situation. In your example someone who was supposed to look after the child didn\u2019t. In this case OP made it clear they would not be looking after the child!", "You do realize that in developed countries, plenty of people have kids that don't want them, can't get abortions even when they're legal for various reasons, and thousands of children are neglected, despite whatever education and rights you're describing, right?", "That would be the solution. Reporting to the lifeguard that a child is without supervision and leaving her with the lifeguard.", "Exactly! If they really wanted to make a point drop the kid off with a lifeguard and say you saw her wandering alone!", "why is it the decent thing to do. my child, my responsibility, and i most certainly wouldn\u2019t leave my toddler by a pool with her young aunt and uncle who very clearly stated they aren\u2019t watching her\u2026.", "Exactly. OP endangered a childs life to make a point. And that\u2018s not ok. It\u2018s not the child\u2018s fault that the mom is an AH. Nor should the child\u2018s life be endangered because of it.\n\nESH.", "This is the answer. You should have informed the lifeguard or a resort worker of an unattended \"lost\" child. You could have called Mike. \n\nWhat would OP have done if the kid drowned", "Reading responses like this makes me hopeful for humans.", "Exactly! A kid can drown so quickly. If they wanted to make a point, a better move would have been to take the child to the lifeguard/staff member and say they couldn't find the child's mother and it was not their child. Then go get drinks.", "Because if they let Alexis leave before leaving themselves they\u2019re actually risking the life of that child", "Ah yes on the one hand an inconvenience. On the other endangering a child. I can totay see how the first one is worse.", "Then why didn't you?\n\nJust go to a staff member and report a kid without supervision. But you choose to let the kid alone in a pool. Guess what? NO ONE WAS LOOKING AT HER.\n\n\n I have family members who lost friends by drowning because the mother was 3 minutes away fetching a glass of water. The kid fell and hit the head on the poolside before going under. A doctor present gave CPR. Not enough. \n\nYTA. \n\nDon't want to watch a kid, fine, leave before the mother/father. Or report immediately to staff. Don't be the one abandoning the kid. You WILL be responsible for any harm to the kid, for family and the law.", "Ye because 3 year olds never just jump into water for no reason. Or trip and fall. She might not have been in the pool at that moment, but she was obviously in the pool area or she wouldn\u2019t have been found by a lifeguard", "You could have done this any other time. Not near a pool.", "She\u2019s 3 dude\u2026 that child could\u2019ve been kidnapped or drowned to death", "Also think of how scary that must have been for Millie! She was probably terrified and searching for someone she knew. That\u2019s not ok. Yes the mom is an AH but you are almost worse because you likely traumatized her.", "Did you put a force field around her? What was stopping her from getting into the pool? Or just walking off in general?", "[removed]", "Do you understand how quickly a child can fall in and drown? You literally endangered the life of a toddler to make a point. Disgusting. \nYTA", "Nope, op says the second mom was out of sight they left. Not before. Op and her brother left that child unattended.", "I mean, if she wanted to make a point she would have left when the SIL tried to push the kid to them", "Reminds me of how i was at the beach this summer with my family, and saw that my counsins were playing with an unknown toddler who was following them to the sea and all. You know what i did? Got up and stayed close to them to make sure the toddler wouldnt drown, and looked around to find her parents just to make sure they were watching her and were aware that she was playing with us, and i still after that kept a close eye bc i got worried. It wasnt my responsability at all, but i got anxious", "Snap my blood is boiling - thankfully nothing physically bad happened this time - but can you imagine how terrified that little girl was. The entire family are assholes", "Mike is the child\u2019s father.", "Yeah, either make sure the kid is with her parents, or let hotel/resort/pool administrators/lifeguards know the child is unattended, but don't get the cops involved. They'll probably shoot her for reckless unarmed loitering.", "Why is suddenly op responsible? She said she couldn\u2019t watch her. Mom left that kid.", "OP never agreed to watch the kid. Not her problem. SIL should be publicly flogged for basically abandoning her child. No means no, and don't be such a douch that'd you'd try to guilt trip someone or go 'wh-what.. imagine what could have happened!!!' to force someone do something they explicitly said they wouldn't.", "Yeah, only about 100 kids are abducted by strangers annually in the US, out of the tens of millions of kids.\n\nThat possibility is like winning the lottery. No one should fear stranger abduction; it\u2019s statistically ridiculous", "It abso-fucking-lutely has worked out for me. People don\u2019t discount what I say. I don\u2019t resort to pleas and mental manipulation when I promise something. I say it clearly, and I mean it.\n\nEveryone in my family communicates this way and it works\u2014 we are a family of straight talkers. When I was 11, my father told me to not wander off in the supermarket. I did\u2014 and he left me. Lesson learned and I never did it again. \n\nMy father told his mother at 12 that he no longer wanted to attend church, and if she continued to force him, as soon as he left home he would never step foot in a church again, not even for her funeral. And that\u2019s exactly what he did when she continued forcing him to go to church.\n\nWe are not a family of threats\u2014 we state the consequences and we follow through. Obviously, this is exactly what Alexis needed after years of threats and protestations from the family.", "Was the lifeguard supposed to go after her if she walked away? The child going into the pool isn't the only worse case scenario here. She could have also just wandered off.", "A toddler only takes a few seconds to slip under the water and drown. Not just that, but someone could have just grabbed her and kidnapped her!!! No one would have looked twice at a toddler throwing a fit being carried away from the pool.", "Drowning isn't a loud affair like you see in movies and television, it's quiet. Especially when it's a very small person (like a toddler).", "Agreed. That was my first thought, too? Why didn\u2019t OP just get up and leave first? She answers someone else who asked that, that it took too long to gather up all their stuff. I\u2019m not 100% sure I believe that excuse\u2026 but I can see it\u2026when I go to the beach or pool, it takes a minute to pack up.", "Did you not say to take the child with you? Why did you go to the pool with her to begin with? Why couldn\u2019t you drop the child off with the dad? Where was he!", "The correct move at that point would have been to turn and leave while she was still there,  not to wait and then be the second adult to abandon the child.\n\nYou were willing to leave a child. You could have left your stuff for a few minutes.", "It means \u201cEveryone sucks here\u201d It\u2019s used when the OP and the person angry at the OP are both AH", "Exactly, not your child.", "Yup", "You, your brother, and Alexis put an innocent child at risk. Alexis might be a shit parent for leaving Millie with you, but you abandoned her. \n\nYou don\u2019t prove points when people could die. ESH but you are the worst.", "Will should have stayed with your stuff while you followed Alexis with Millie, handed her over and left. By that time Will would have the stuff together and met you at the bar. If Alexis brought her back and said watch her, again, stay on her heels with Millie and just don\u2019t let her leave.

But yes we do have a different view when it comes to other people and their children. \n\nI'll also add that I wouldn't do nothing if something *was* going bad with someone's unnattended child.
