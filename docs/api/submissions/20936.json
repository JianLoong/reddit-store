If she can\u2019t get a grip on how shit the works then she can cry about it while she stays home.", "NTA. Your cousin is rude & entitled if she thinks that she can sit on her a$$ while the rest of the family pitches in. Let her have her tantrum. She has no one to blame but herself.", "NTA.... I wonder why it's so confusing? Why should everyone but her carry the work load? How do they reason this out?", "NTA. She\u2019s a big girl now aka legal adult and can use her own voice. She\u2019s not really an adult if she\u2019s still trying to gets others to have conversations for her.  She also just wants a free vacation with \u201cmaid\u201d service.", "NTA. I didn't like having to help clean up my grandpa's house on my last vacation, even as I understood the reason we were doing it (preparing it for sale due to my grandpa no longer living there), but I still did it without complaint, because it was a condition for coming down on the trip and wasn't all that much work. It's not an unreasonable expectation that you help at least tidy up your mess when someone is letting you stay at their place for free.", "NTA\n\nI could understand if there was a particular chore that she was uncomfortable with doing for whatever reason, but NONE?

It\u2019s not like your aunt needs a tire changed and asked for help. \n\nIn order to use someone else\u2019s property during a vacation someone else planned, the hosts are asking that everyone take care of the property. It\u2019s a free vacation as long as you participate in the maintaining of the property while there. \n\nThat\u2019s a completely fair trade.

You guys have a great deal, and it\u2019s not like it\u2019s an inconvenience in any way, it\u2019s the same kind of chores you\u2019d be doing at home and at the lake house I assume you have nothing but time.

My brothers have been having the same argument but over a hunting property. You do some sharp work and then once that's fine you can go hunting.

Other brother is that's not how it works so now 1st brother isn't allowed to go to this property", "Is it even a vacation if you don\u2019t go grocery shopping in a strange store and do dishes in a weirdly designed sink?", "Also OP is not the one deciding anyway, she just refused to pleade the cousin's case", "Two somethings for nothing: no chores, and for OP to plead her case.", "ESH - babysitting and pet sitting are not reasonable expectations of guests.", "NTA. Your cousin is an unusual proactive kind of asshole, announcing that she won't pitch in with chores in advance. Very nice of them really - the whole family can cut them loose before the trip.\n\n\nMost assholes would just go on the trip and then either vanish or refuse when chores needed to be done. This is much better.", "NTA, she can rent a place nearby, go back there for all her meals then pay a massive cleaning fee because she never cleaned.", "Here is a question, why didn't she ask her parents to talk to the aunt and uncle.  Please let the rest of the family know that she has been harassing you to help her go and not do chores.", "100%NTA \n\n1. Why is she arguing this with you, like you have any say over the homeowner/host! \n\n2. Let her know it is an adult only vacation.  If she wants to be a 5yo and have someone play mommy and do all her cooking and cleaning and laundry and follow her around picking up after her, she needs to stay home. \n\nIf she wants to be included as an adult, she can share chores.", " NTA. Did she expect the OP to plead with the aunt and uncle on her behalf and maybe offer to do extra chores so she could just could just lounge around?"]}
