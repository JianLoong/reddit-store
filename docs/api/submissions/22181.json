I slowly drifted away from the church while she's remained faithful which I respect. \n\nShe dated a man last year who she thought she was going to marry but they broke up. She believes in saving herself for marriage and its also important for her boyfriends to do the same. But I know she's done an\\*l with her ex. She doesn't see doing an\\*l as losing her virginity, as apparently only PNV does that. She also did/received oral, I personally don't see that as sex but I know in my church they would. \n\nI don't really talk to her about this sort of thing anymore as she knows I'm not religious and it protects our friendship to not get into theological debate as neither of us will cede. So whatever, she's a virgin if she thinks she's a virgin. \n\nBut this has come to a head because she's now dating a man who is her idea of perfect. He is deeply religious, saving himself, loyal, hard working, traditional, good family etc etc. He's started talking about wanted to get engaged soon and Laura is very in love and eagerly awaiting the proposal. \n\nLaura and I were chatting about him and the situation and I asked her if she's told him she's not a virgin (as it's important to him). She got defensive and said she IS a virgin, so I rephrased my question and said ok, does he know you're a virgin who's done an\\*l? She said no, it's not important. I told her she should really consider telling him as he's very staunch and they'd be starting their marriage off on a lie. Just because she doesn't see an\\*l as losing her V, doesn't mean he doesn't. \n\nShe stormed off and said \"don't expect an invitation\" and I haven't heard from her since. I feel terrible and like I lost my oldest friend, but even though I don't believe in saving yourself, I don't think it's fair for her lead to her bf to believe she's something that she isn't even if she somehow believes it herself.

It seems like your intention was to ensure honesty in your friend's relationship, given the importance her boyfriend places on virginity. However, it's crucial to remember that discussions around personal topics like sex and virginity can be sensitive, and people have different views on what constitutes as losing virginity. You might have unintentionally crossed a boundary by challenging her belief. For future, it may be better to have these discussions in a more gentle and understanding manner, respecting her views while expressing your concern for her relationship's honesty.", "ESH.

Definitely NTA.", "ESH because it's really none of your business if your BFF is using the poophole loophole.", "ESH\n\nFor one, the entire concept of \"virginity\" is ridiculous. It's just a manipulation tactic that religious zealots invented to control women, and make them think that their self worth is tied to their chastity, and whether or not a man gets to declare ownership of her reproductive capabilities. Which it absolutely is not.\n\nFor two, it's none of your business who she is doing what with.\n\nFor three, if you were genuinely concerned about your \"friend\", you wouldn't be shaming her.

She's not asking the peanut gallery for advise as to what makes a virgin.\n\nYTA", "YTA If your definition of virginity is \"never being intimate with a man\", she's fibbing. If it is \"not having had intercourse, or having an intact hymen\" then she's telling thr truth. Either way, its her own personal busibess. Yes, I understand you two share these kinds of confidences.

Not everything needs commenting upon.", "YTA\n\nI completely agree with you 1000% that virginity as it's expected of women in a conservative Christian context is superstitious patriarchal bullshit.\n\nThat said, why are you acting like an advocate for this fiance you barely know, against your longtime friend? I mean, yes, she's had sex that no one who isn't a vaginal hymen fetishist would recognize as sex. Obviously.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why you're so angry at her for it? I don't think you've moved as far away from your church as you think you have if you're making her the bad guy for not disclosing to this guy (who, again, you barely know.)

Better than that is not having done things you want to keep secret.\n\nUltimately you aren't the one lying to someone else to benefit yourself.  If she never did any of the things you claim she did then you would be the asshole.  The negative consequences are a result of her actions not yours.  She has had sex and even worse she has lied about it, either directly or by a material omission.\n\nBy seeking to marry she is publicly claiming she wants to share herself with someone else.  Your disclosures are in accordance with that public declaration of hers.  I don't know how I would answer if she were marrying in secret, but it seems she is making her marriage a public event and this contradicts an expectation of privacy and therefore secrecy.  Some marriage ceremonies even call for people to object for any reason, most have removed this, but it is evidence that you are holding yourself out to the community as married and the community can respond.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s common knowledge religious folk use oral and anal sex to skirt around the rules on a technicality. Otherwise, they\u2019d all go insane. You admit you\u2019re not even religious.

Morally no, but you\u2019re not the morality police. \u201cHave you told your partner that you\u2019ve had a dick in your butt?\u201d is a weird and invasive question, whether Jesus is involved or not.

Either that or you're being very disingenuous with your interpretation of OPs motivations. \n\n(For one) Maybe I'm reading into it too much, but I thought it was heavily implied that OPs beliefs on sexuality and \"virginity\" are much more progressive than those of any others described in this story. You are likely preaching to the choir. \n\n(For two) ?? I don't think OP was being nosy at all. She has knowledge of some of her friends sexual exploits - that's pretty normal for friends. \n\n(For three) She wasn't shaming her in the slightest though? She was concerned that her friend was lying to her fiance about something that, while unimportant to OP, is demonstrably VERY important to the fiance.", "Because we grew up in a church that controlled our sexuality and neither of us had sisters or other women in our lives we could talk to about it it's a very insular community.", "Catholics do this too. \n\nThat\u2019s what happens when you discourage critical thought \u2026", "Jehovah's Witness here.

Yeah, any definition of virginity that excludes oral and anal puts gay people in the unique forever-a-virgin position in the eyes of the church, but we all know that\u2019s not how they\u2019d see it.", "Exactly, sounds like she's waiting for an excuse to criticize her supposed \"friend.\"", "I thought this was about her friend butting *in*... bad joke, it was right there though lol...", "She asked a question and then expressed her belief. If that makes her TA, then how are anyone truly friends. For me, friends express those thoughts and concerns. Otherwise, they are aquaitetences or even strangers.", "Since she told OP about her sex life, that implies she\u2019s open to discussing it with OP. OP is not randomly bringing it up either, since they were discussing the fianc\u00e9. \n\nAs a friend, OP is not wrong to bring it up. These are the kinds of things that can matter to Christians depending on how strict they are about it. Like I know my brother has done it with his fianc\u00e9, and while some churches are more open to it, I\u2019ve let him know that some churches will not be able to marry them, and to choose their church accordingly if getting married by a pastor is important to them. \n\nOP is not judging the friend, just pointing out a problem the friend may not have considered. Better to hash it out before they get married. \n\nAnd before someone tries to make an argument, yes some churches do ask about the sex life of the people they marry, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. They\u2019re just being consistent in the rules they believe in. Various churches have different interpretations of the Bible anyway, so couples can just find a different church to get married in if needed.", "I don't really understand the \"mind your business\" comments because we've spoken about sex and relationships a lot.

It\u2019s like you need her to see this the same way you do.", ". Yes, as a sexually active gay man, you can technically be \"a virgin with women\" and same logic applies for gay women. So yeah, whether you are a virgin or not depends on how you define virginity. Most religious people I know follow the \"everything but\" rule. Well, expecting Religion to be logical is just asking too much.", "It\u2019s none of any church\u2019s business when it comes to the sex lives of its parishioners."]}
