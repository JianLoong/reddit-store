Gia was going through a very tough time having split up with Arthur\u2019s father shortly after having her second child, who was born with a severe disability, and she was struggled mentally and practically, which meant Arthur\u2019s care was falling by the wayside. Our parents stepped in and we all agreed that my husband and I would take custody of him. It was meant to be temporary, but after a year Gia formally signed over her rights and my husband, Arthur, my daughter and I moved abroad (1.5 hour flight from Gia). Arthur visits his mother in school holidays and Gia comes out to visit us in the summer and at Christmas. Gia has worked very hard to rebuild her life and now has a fianc\u00e9 and a third child. \n\nOver the past year, Arthur has been putting up more of a fight about going to visit Gia. He says he wants to see his friends during holidays and do more sports (he competes in go karting). He also says he doesn\u2019t like going to Gia\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t have his own space there, has much less freedom, doesn\u2019t like the food, activities, etc. I do understand  but at the same time I\u2019ve always said it\u2019s important that he sees his mother.\n\nThis came up again when I was making plans for half term and Arthur asked if he could skip his trip to see his mother. He said going to Gia\u2019s place just feels like he\u2019s being punished for not being our bio child. He said he just wants to stay home like his sister (my daughter). This absolutely broke my heart. I love Arthur just the same as I love my daughter and the thought he would feel singled out in any way she tore me to pieces. I talked it over with my husband and we decided that we wouldn\u2019t force Arthur to go. \n\nGia is furious. She called me all sorts of horrible things, accused me of pressuring her to give up custody of Arthur (this didn\u2019t happen) and stealing her baby (again, not true). She berated me for letting him call me Mum, for turning our parents against her, for turning her son into a spoilt brat who looks down on her. Eventually she said if I didn\u2019t make him come and visit she would sue me for custody of him. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to a lawyer, who says there is next to no chance that a judge would give custody back to Gia. The parents (mother and Gia\u2019s father) think I should retain custody of Arthur but that I should still make sure he is visiting Gia, at least for the next couple of years, as he is too young to realise the impact not having any bond with her will be and he can decide that when he\u2019s older. \n\nMy husband and I are just trying to do right by Arthur. I don\u2019t want him feeling like we don\u2019t take his opinion into account. But at the same time I don\u2019t want to put him through the stress of a legal battle over all this, and I believe Gia when she said she\u2019ll start suing for custody, even if she won\u2019t win.\n\nSo AITA for not making him go?", "created_utc": 1694176010, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16d980f/aita_for_not_forcing_my_nephew_of_whom_i_have/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or why isn\u2019t she coming by herself to visit instead? I think when it comes down to it, she\u2019s signed away her rights and Arthur doesn\u2019t want to visit so really her feelings are the lowest priority in your decision chain.\n\nI think gia is being an asshole with blaming you for all this when it seems like you and your husband have been the ones who have really saved her son and helped her a lot too by allowing her time to get her life in order. I can understand her feeling bad but she shouldn\u2019t take it out on you. Also the more I reread your post the more I think she\u2019s a complete asshole because she gave up willingly her son so she can hardly complain that he\u2019s doing well now\u2026 it seems like there is jealousy at work here too maybe", "NTA. He's your kid now. You are his mom. \n\nYes, Gia might've had her reasons for not being able to care for him before but if she wants to maintain some relationship with him, she's going to have to be the one making the effort. Ultimately though, it's his choice on whether he wants any relationship with his biological mother, he can't be forced into it. \n\nP.S.

It's important you support it, no matter how silly it may seem to you - it's important to him.", "NTA\n\nTell her to get off her ass and come visit her kid.

He's been jerked around enough by having such a fractured situation, following whatever he wishes is really the only way to allow him to heal.

That's very important. \n\nThat's coming from someone that went through similar.", "There needs to be a video call, given the distance With the adults of both households and Arthur.

As he gets older, he probably will get a lot busier and have less time to visit.  On one hand Gia needs to know this.  But at the same time she is trying to preserve her bond with her bio son and not let it slip away. \n\nYou are between a rock and hard place TBH.  Lot of arguments to swing it one way or the other.  Why not see a family counselor to sort it out instead of Reddit?", "NTA\n\nShe went and had another kid during the 6 years Arthur's lived with you.

That's not fair to Arthur.", "Nta. Keep him", "NTA - Your job is to protect and take care of your child. If he doesnt want to go and you force him, youre crushing your relationship to him and traumatizing him. Id call the cops on you if I knew.\n\nId recommend to give Gia some days to cool off and then make a video call with Arthur and Gia and you and let him explain to her, why he doesnt want to come and what she could do to change that. Him not feeling home there is a big issue on her end. Then its up to her to accommodate or not but you need to protect Arthur from manipulation and threats, that might come his way and enforce his wishes.

You are doing what is right for him and if he wants to stay at home to be with his friends and do sports during the holidays then he should.\n\nIt may be tough on Gia now that she is in a better place but his upbringing is no longer her responsibility and she doesn't get to dictate what happens.  Someone probably needs to be very blunt with her and explain she is now effectively his aunt.", "NTA\n\nGia can come visit Arthur where he feels comfortable.  Isn't that most important, Gia? \n\nArthur is the priority.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't want to spend time with her, if you force him to spend time wit her won't magically create a bond between the two of them. The opposite is more likely to happen just with the bonus that he connects his misery with you punishing him! \n\nWhat you can do, is offer Arthur and Gia that he could spend a week or two at her place. And only tell Arthur, that if he realises he wants to spend more time there, you won't be upset. But that's something only for Arthur to know, otherwise Gia could try to preasure him to say he want's to stay longer on phone. \n\nBut if he doesn't want to spend time at her place, don't force him. If she insits on not going there, family therapy should be the next step!", "I think NTA.\n\nBUT\u2026\n\nI do think perhaps some therapy for Arthur is in order. Perhaps the therapist can help him sort through his feelings.\n\nIs there any compromise in maybe taking a family trip? Arthur stays with you but can visit his mom while you are there?\n\nIf not, my recommendation would be to get Arthur a lawyer to represent his interests. They can sort through the legalities, although, if she relinquished custody, I don\u2019t think she has much of a chance. It\u2019s his best interests ultimately that are most important. I commend you for wanting to make him feel safe and loved.", "NTA. When she signed her rights away, there was no contractual or other entitlement preserving her access to Arthur. I do feel very sad for her, but she should have known this could happen at some point and it's really unfair of her to attack you over it. That speaks volumes about her character and state of mind. The BEST she could do is try to stay in contact with him and be a positive role in his life so that when he is older and more independent, they may have a good relationship. Forcing it now will only instill resentment and make Arthur miserable.", "NTA\nGia signed over her rights. If he doesn\u2019t want to see her he shouldn\u2019t have to.", "NTA. Is there a way to increase communication btwn Arthur and Gia via video calls? \n\nThat may help appease the situation. Gia has to understand, she is birth mom, but you are his active mom and will do what is best for HIM. I'm sure Gia isn't helping to support Arthur financially or even emotionally, or she'd know how Arthur feels already and take that into consideration before blowing up on you. \n\nDon't let your sis or family guilt trip or gaslight you into shit. Especially when you are raising your son. \n\nIf you force him to do things at 12 that affect his social life and sports, you are telling him his feelings and livelihood aren't as important as the adults in his life, no matter the situation. \n\nHave you adopted him, since she signed over rights? Make it permanent if that is what you both want. Give him the legal family backing and name, if that is different, that he wants.\n\n She made a selfless decision to make sure Arthur had the best life.

She might not see it that way, but he certainly does.

Firstly, Gia is a full time carer to a disabled child, and mother to a toddler, and she has no domestic help. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of undivided time for Arthur, which he\u2019s not used to. She also has to plan activities within a budget and other constraints (suitability for the other children), which again is something Arthur isn\u2019t used to.

Gia wasn\u2019t happy with this option, which I understand because she is a full time cared for one of her children and the other is a toddler so childcare isn\u2019t simple. \n\nIn a way this is a good time for this to come up, because you\u2019re right, Arthur will soon be building his own life, that can\u2019t always be interrupted for these visits especially against his will. \n\nWe\u2019re not all local so counselling isn\u2019t really an option for all of us. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure what a counsellor could tell us.

He didn\u2019t mind going but said he didn\u2019t feel like he had much to talk about and the therapist said that he was very well adjusted and while he may later have more feelings to discuss, she felt okay about discontinuing the sessions for the time being. I\u2019m not against him going back but I don\u2019t feel that his not wanting to visit Gia is due to deep seated resentment, more for the logical reasons he\u2019s outlined to us. I also don\u2019t want him to feel like we are making him go back to therapy to change his mind about going, so maybe once this settles down we could send him for an exploratory session.\n\nArthur said he would be fine going to the country and seeing Gia, but he doesn\u2019t want to stay with her and doesn\u2019t want to see his half siblings. I offered this to Gia but she wasn\u2019t receptive, and given her difficulties with childcare I can understand that, especially during school holidays. \n\nI\u2019m not worried about Gia regaining custody, our lawyers assured us she wouldn\u2019t win and honestly from a logical perspective I don\u2019t see a judge taking her side.

She does spend one on one time with him when she\u2019s visiting because her partner is there to look after the kids, but when Arthur visits her, her partner is at work so he doesn\u2019t get much one on one time with her", "He can\u2019t choose because those weeks are when the school holidays are.\n\nETA: honestly I do think it\u2019s reasonable for him to choose not to go, which is why we\u2019re letting him. I just don\u2019t want him to regret it later.", "I know first hand how he feels. My maternal grandfather raised me. My mother signed over her rights and at times she acted like I wasn\u2019t apart of her, her family with my other siblings who she had custody of. I just cut her off for good last month.", "Personally I think at 12 he is old enough to have some choice and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d make him go stay with gia if he really didn\u2019t want to. Maybe he can skip this year and see how he feels next year? It feels unfair that she gives him up but then wants to see him only under her ideal conditions, I can completely understand Arthur\u2019s resentment.", "Sounds like he doesn\u2019t get any one on one time with her during his visits. How much does she actually spend with him?", "There's your answer then. It makes complete sense that he thinks you're punishing him by sending him away every summer. Away from his friends, his family, his home, his belongings, his \"familiar\". There's no way you're going to lose that boy to a custody lawsuit after it was signed over to you and your husband.", "I\u2019m sure he\u2019s resentful that after sending him away because his sibling is disabled, Gia went ahead and had a third kid and kept it.", "If she wants to see him more, she can make arrangements. Having kids isn't supposed to be easy, but she already tried to take the easy route by ditching her kid on you.\n\n\nIt's not your responsibility to force a relationship, that's only going to harm your relationship with him. You are his parent, regardless of her feelings on the matter. She made that decision. It's your job to protect your child.", "> We\u2019re not all local so counselling isn\u2019t really an option for all of us\n\nZoom.", "\u201cMissing out on something\u201d - what do you mean by this? If the something is a relationship with his bio mom , forcing it isn\u2019t going to accomplish that especially when he is miserable.\n\nNotice how I said bio mom? That\u2019s because you are his mother. Own it.", "Does he have to help take care of his younger siblings?", "That is totally fair. My biofather gave up his rights and it was easy peasy for my dad to adopt after that point. Depends on the state and situation, I suppose. \n\nYou are doing right by him and that is all that matters. \u2661", "If you look at foster children and adopted children, best practice is for them to continue to have a relationship with their bio parents. That's what we are looking at here.  \n\n\nChildren =/= adults and part of raising children is to help them with decisions like this.  \n\n\nAs I said, it seems that Arthur has a hard time with visiting Gia because it isn't fun. But that's not the point of the visit, the point is to continue to develop relationships.", "Not much, I gather. I said this elsewhere, but between a toddler, being a full time carer for a disabled child, and not having any domestic help, Gia has a lot of daily responsibilities. I totally get that. She can\u2019t just drop everything because Arthur is there. It\u2019s different when she visits us because her partner is on holiday too and can help with childcare but when he\u2019s at work full time it\u2019s different.\n\nI know she tries her best, but I also know that trying doesn\u2019t mean succeeding", "We don\u2019t send him away every summer. He goes one week in October, one week in February, and two weeks in April. Gia and her partner + kids come to us for two weeks in the summer and at Christmas.\n\nWe won\u2019t lose custody of him. No judge would take him from a home he\u2019s happy in, make him move countries to a busy home environment where he doesn\u2019t even have his own room. But if Gia fought for custody Arthur would likely have to provide a statement/meet with a judge/have a psych evaluation on top of knowing what was happening and I don\u2019t want to put him through that if it can be avoided.", "For foster, that is for the purpose of reunification. I agree in most situations. Sometimes, parents are bad people though. That isn't the case here though. She's not a bad birth mom and he also will likely never live with her again. \n\nHe is an in-betweener.\n\nYou are absolutely right that contact should continue, but should be at Arthur's comfort level. He knows she is there and simply is putting HIS life ahead of hers. I am sure he still sees her and can contact her when he wants and vice versa. He knows she exists and what she is like which is WHY they say it is important if contact with the birth family is possible. That doesn't give birth mom the right to dictate her kid's life that she isn't a part of daily. She tasked her sister with that and her sis is doing right by THEIR son.", "Unfortunately he probably hasn\u2019t bonded to any of his siblings over there. Poor thing, hopefully she willing to compromise to see him.", "My suggestion would be to secure a good lawyer for this so that the whole thing can be (if it ever comes to it) thrown out before it even comes to what you described. in the end, you're NTA for not forcing the boy. Maybe have the parents (Gia's father and your mother) listen to the boy on whether he's comfortable with going to visit Gia.\n\nAs someone who grew up between two cities (my father worked in a different country), I can tell you I understand why he hates it. It doesn't matter if it's once a year or 3-4 small visits. If he's uncomfortable, nothing would change that feeling."]}
