Gia was going through a very tough time having split up with Arthur\u2019s father shortly after having her second child, who was born with a severe disability, and she was struggled mentally and practically, which meant Arthur\u2019s care was falling by the wayside. Our parents stepped in and we all agreed that my husband and I would take custody of him. It was meant to be temporary, but after a year Gia formally signed over her rights and my husband, Arthur, my daughter and I moved abroad (1.5 hour flight from Gia). Arthur visits his mother in school holidays and Gia comes out to visit us in the summer and at Christmas. Gia has worked very hard to rebuild her life and now has a fianc\u00e9 and a third child. \n\nOver the past year, Arthur has been putting up more of a fight about going to visit Gia. He says he wants to see his friends during holidays and do more sports (he competes in go karting). He also says he doesn\u2019t like going to Gia\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t have his own space there, has much less freedom, doesn\u2019t like the food, activities, etc. I do understand  but at the same time I\u2019ve always said it\u2019s important that he sees his mother.\n\nThis came up again when I was making plans for half term and Arthur asked if he could skip his trip to see his mother. He said going to Gia\u2019s place just feels like he\u2019s being punished for not being our bio child. He said he just wants to stay home like his sister (my daughter). This absolutely broke my heart. I love Arthur just the same as I love my daughter and the thought he would feel singled out in any way she tore me to pieces. I talked it over with my husband and we decided that we wouldn\u2019t force Arthur to go. \n\nGia is furious. She called me all sorts of horrible things, accused me of pressuring her to give up custody of Arthur (this didn\u2019t happen) and stealing her baby (again, not true). She berated me for letting him call me Mum, for turning our parents against her, for turning her son into a spoilt brat who looks down on her. Eventually she said if I didn\u2019t make him come and visit she would sue me for custody of him. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to a lawyer, who says there is next to no chance that a judge would give custody back to Gia. The parents (mother and Gia\u2019s father) think I should retain custody of Arthur but that I should still make sure he is visiting Gia, at least for the next couple of years, as he is too young to realise the impact not having any bond with her will be and he can decide that when he\u2019s older. \n\nMy husband and I are just trying to do right by Arthur. I don\u2019t want him feeling like we don\u2019t take his opinion into account. But at the same time I don\u2019t want to put him through the stress of a legal battle over all this, and I believe Gia when she said she\u2019ll start suing for custody, even if she won\u2019t win.\n\nSo AITA for not making him go?", "created_utc": 1694176010, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16d980f/aita_for_not_forcing_my_nephew_of_whom_i_have/", "score": 1893, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or why isn\u2019t she coming by herself to visit instead? I think when it comes down to it, she\u2019s signed away her rights and Arthur doesn\u2019t want to visit so really her feelings are the lowest priority in your decision chain.\n\nI think gia is being an asshole with blaming you for all this when it seems like you and your husband have been the ones who have really saved her son and helped her a lot too by allowing her time to get her life in order. I can understand her feeling bad but she shouldn\u2019t take it out on you. Also the more I reread your post the more I think she\u2019s a complete asshole because she gave up willingly her son so she can hardly complain that he\u2019s doing well now\u2026 it seems like there is jealousy at work here too maybe", "NTA. He's your kid now. You are his mom. \n\nYes, Gia might've had her reasons for not being able to care for him before but if she wants to maintain some relationship with him, she's going to have to be the one making the effort. Ultimately though, it's his choice on whether he wants any relationship with his biological mother, he can't be forced into it. \n\nP.S.

He's been jerked around enough by having such a fractured situation, following whatever he wishes is really the only way to allow him to heal.

That's very important. \n\nThat's coming from someone that went through similar.", "There needs to be a video call, given the distance With the adults of both households and Arthur.

As he gets older, he probably will get a lot busier and have less time to visit.  On one hand Gia needs to know this.  But at the same time she is trying to preserve her bond with her bio son and not let it slip away. \n\nYou are between a rock and hard place TBH.  Lot of arguments to swing it one way or the other.  Why not see a family counselor to sort it out instead of Reddit?", "NTA\n\nShe went and had another kid during the 6 years Arthur's lived with you.

That's not fair to Arthur.", "Nta. Keep him", "NTA - Your job is to protect and take care of your child. If he doesnt want to go and you force him, youre crushing your relationship to him and traumatizing him. Id call the cops on you if I knew.\n\nId recommend to give Gia some days to cool off and then make a video call with Arthur and Gia and you and let him explain to her, why he doesnt want to come and what she could do to change that. Him not feeling home there is a big issue on her end.

You are doing what is right for him and if he wants to stay at home to be with his friends and do sports during the holidays then he should.\n\nIt may be tough on Gia now that she is in a better place but his upbringing is no longer her responsibility and she doesn't get to dictate what happens.  Someone probably needs to be very blunt with her and explain she is now effectively his aunt.", "NTA\n\nGia can come visit Arthur where he feels comfortable.  Isn't that most important, Gia? \n\nArthur is the priority.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't want to spend time with her, if you force him to spend time wit her won't magically create a bond between the two of them. The opposite is more likely to happen just with the bonus that he connects his misery with you punishing him! \n\nWhat you can do, is offer Arthur and Gia that he could spend a week or two at her place. And only tell Arthur, that if he realises he wants to spend more time there, you won't be upset. But that's something only for Arthur to know, otherwise Gia could try to preasure him to say he want's to stay longer on phone. \n\nBut if he doesn't want to spend time at her place, don't force him. If she insits on not going there, family therapy should be the next step!", "I think NTA.\n\nBUT\u2026\n\nI do think perhaps some therapy for Arthur is in order. Perhaps the therapist can help him sort through his feelings.\n\nIs there any compromise in maybe taking a family trip? Arthur stays with you but can visit his mom while you are there?\n\nIf not, my recommendation would be to get Arthur a lawyer to represent his interests. They can sort through the legalities, although, if she relinquished custody, I don\u2019t think she has much of a chance. It\u2019s his best interests ultimately that are most important. I commend you for wanting to make him feel safe and loved.", "NTA. When she signed her rights away, there was no contractual or other entitlement preserving her access to Arthur. I do feel very sad for her, but she should have known this could happen at some point and it's really unfair of her to attack you over it. That speaks volumes about her character and state of mind. The BEST she could do is try to stay in contact with him and be a positive role in his life so that when he is older and more independent, they may have a good relationship. Forcing it now will only instill resentment and make Arthur miserable.", "NTA\nGia signed over her rights. If he doesn\u2019t want to see her he shouldn\u2019t have to.", "NTA. Is there a way to increase communication btwn Arthur and Gia via video calls? \n\nThat may help appease the situation. Gia has to understand, she is birth mom, but you are his active mom and will do what is best for HIM. I'm sure Gia isn't helping to support Arthur financially or even emotionally, or she'd know how Arthur feels already and take that into consideration before blowing up on you. \n\nDon't let your sis or family guilt trip or gaslight you into shit. Especially when you are raising your son. \n\nIf you force him to do things at 12 that affect his social life and sports, you are telling him his feelings and livelihood aren't as important as the adults in his life, no matter the situation. \n\nHave you adopted him, since she signed over rights? Make it permanent if that is what you both want. Give him the legal family backing and name, if that is different, that he wants.\n\n She made a selfless decision to make sure Arthur had the best life.

She might not see it that way, but he certainly does.

Firstly, Gia is a full time carer to a disabled child, and mother to a toddler, and she has no domestic help. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of undivided time for Arthur, which he\u2019s not used to. She also has to plan activities within a budget and other constraints (suitability for the other children), which again is something Arthur isn\u2019t used to.

Gia wasn\u2019t happy with this option, which I understand because she is a full time cared for one of her children and the other is a toddler so childcare isn\u2019t simple. \n\nIn a way this is a good time for this to come up, because you\u2019re right, Arthur will soon be building his own life, that can\u2019t always be interrupted for these visits especially against his will. \n\nWe\u2019re not all local so counselling isn\u2019t really an option for all of us. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure what a counsellor could tell us.

He didn\u2019t mind going but said he didn\u2019t feel like he had much to talk about and the therapist said that he was very well adjusted and while he may later have more feelings to discuss, she felt okay about discontinuing the sessions for the time being. I\u2019m not against him going back but I don\u2019t feel that his not wanting to visit Gia is due to deep seated resentment, more for the logical reasons he\u2019s outlined to us. I also don\u2019t want him to feel like we are making him go back to therapy to change his mind about going, so maybe once this settles down we could send him for an exploratory session.\n\nArthur said he would be fine going to the country and seeing Gia, but he doesn\u2019t want to stay with her and doesn\u2019t want to see his half siblings. I offered this to Gia but she wasn\u2019t receptive, and given her difficulties with childcare I can understand that, especially during school holidays. \n\nI\u2019m not worried about Gia regaining custody, our lawyers assured us she wouldn\u2019t win and honestly from a logical perspective I don\u2019t see a judge taking her side.

Don't even question that nonsense.\n\nWhile my situations are a bit different... I'm sure you'll see the connection. First story is about me and being forced to go to my dad's house, where I always felt unwelcome. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was about 7. No biggie, I can easily get over that. I figured out by the time I was 10 that neither of my parents actually wanted me. My mother however, was there and she loves me and always has, but she never really wanted children... it's okay, that I can get past too, because she made sure that I was well cared for and my stepdad has always been there for me in ways my mother couldn't. My stepmom... she didn't want me around, she didn't want to see me, she didn't want my dad to have a relationship with me. My dad however, had visitation. While I wasn't necessarily forced to go there, I was guilted into it. \n\nBy the time I was 13, I stood up to all of them. I didn't have my own space at my dad's house, my stepmom refused to have any kind of relationship with me, so if my dad was working overtime, I was left to fend for myself while my stepbrothers were doted on. The youngest of those stepbrothers (we were each about a year and a half apart in age, me being the oldest) and I always referred to each other as brother and sister. We were pretty close considering the strained relationship I had with my dad and stepmom. However, I felt like I was unwanted there and my mother guilting me into going there made me feel like she needed a break from me. That makes kids feel awful. \n\nSecond story is me being the mom to two non-bio kids. I have two bio kids of my own, which are 20 (daughter) and 15 (son). My daughter's boyfriend moved in with us nearly 4 years ago, because his household was toxic and he was failing in school. My husband and I helped him graduate and now he's in the Air National Guard for his education. His youngest sister moved in with us almost 2 months ago now for similar reasons as her brother. She hadn't failed, but had to take summer school following her junior year, her dad refused to pay for the second half, and so my household scrounged up the money to make sure she could finish. She's just started her senior year. While her father was reluctant to let his 17 year old daughter move in with us, he knew that it was best for her. We're not keeping him from her or vice-versa. We aren't asking anything of him or her mother (she doesn't know that her daughter is here though). She's in the school that she should be in and has two parents that care for her enough to ensure she graduates in the spring. I would never force either of the two non-bio kids to see their parents. I may suggest they talk to them, but it's up to them to make that decision. They've both decided to go NC with their mother and LC with their father. They both call me mom and my husband dad. Hell, my daughter isn't even biologically my husband's (she's from a previous marriage), but calls my husband dad.\n\nWe're certainly not perfect parents, but we do everything we can to make sure these kids have a decent start to adulthood while knowing that people care and love them... biological relation means nothing in my household. My former in-laws and I are still close. My ex decided he didn't want anything to do with his family a very long time ago. My current in-laws, my mom and stepdad, and my former in-laws all treat all of the kids in my home as if they were their grandchildren. That's how it should be. I wish I could say the same for my father and stepmom.

It's never an easy decision to give up a child, especially when you think they would be better off without you being their sole provider (be it financially, emotionally, etc). She was drowning and offered a way to ensure both her son and herself could survive with minimal damage. Of course she took the offer.\n\nYou stated she signed away her rights when yall were leaving the country so yall could get his passports and other legal documents, not when yall 1st got custody of him.

Unlike a lot of people attacking her for not attempting to get her 1st born back asap, I understand why she didn't. He was happy, stable, and was still able to see her and his siblings.\n\nHowever, it's clear she isn't able to provide for him in the exact same fashion as you are (i.e. the room and attention situations). She's far busier than you and probably doesn't make the same as you do financially. Arthur is used to a standard and when not given that same standard it won't matter *who* is providing it, a child will typically go with the better standard. That's not to say Gia isn't currently a capable parent, she's just not the same as you are.\n\nAs a 12yo, you're able and are going to vocalize what feels better to you. He's not wrong in how he feels and you're not wrong with respecting his feelings. \n\nAs a parent who is trying her best and wanting to be with her children as much as possible, Gia is not wrong either. Granted, she's probably lashing out because it may feel as though she was coerced into giving him up because she didn't see a better option at the time; couple that with being informed he doesn't want to be with her or his siblings, it's probably a roundhouse kick in the gut for her.\n\nHonestly, all 3 of you need to have a serious, uninterrupted talk about where these feelings are stemming from and a compromise *after* the feelings are expressed. Because any decision made before communication from any person will only become fuel for heartache and resentment.

He has a whole life, friends, activities, etc. If Gia thinks visits are so important, she can travel to him for the visit. \n\nIt sucks that she wants to start a custody battle over this, but trying to force him to visit her is just going to make any relationship with her deteriorate and eventually he will cut contact. Gia will lose him completely, and possibly forever, if she starts down this path. If you force him I fear his relationship with you will also be damaged.", "NTA - Arthur is getting the age where friends, interests and hobbies are a priority for him over family visits. It's going to be this way for a while. I can understand his bio-mom's sadness over this but it's a fact of life and it's typical for kids when they're in their pre-teen/teen and even early 20s to want to be with friends and participating in sports/hobbies. This is important socially for them, learning how to navigate friendships and social activities, forming strong bonds with people their own age and with similar interests. Even for you and your husband as his parents, you will see that he's more focused on spending time with his friends and puts his relationship/spending time with you guys a little further down the priority list. \n\nThe likelihood of his bio-mom getting custody is slim to none, especially since she appears to be unable to put his wants and needs ahead of her own. Assuming that he doesn't want to go NC with his bio-mom, maybe there are things she can do such as coming for a visit, going to one of his go-kart competitions. Clearly she would like to still have time with him but she has to understand that she is not his \"mum\" in the same sense that you are. You're the one who has filled that role in his life and she, although biologically his mother, is not viewed by him in the same way. That is to be expected when she signed away her parental rights. Sounds like she's got a lot of growing up to do.", "NTA for not forcing Arthur to visit bio mom.  Is it possible to make a different arrangement?  Maybe he visits for 2-3 days, or your whole family visits Gia\u2019s city so you can have a family vacation, and Arthur can visit Gia and her kids a bit.  Do you think Gia is putting in a show for her new fianc\u00e9e?  Put Arthur first in this.", "NTA\nForcing a teenager does not make a good relationship. It will only break it.\n\nYour sister needs to consider your son as an individual person with the same feelings and rights as her.\n\nBased on what I\u2019ve seen in the other comments, I\u2019d suggest rather than this visit that you suggest to them that they video call once a week. So he gets some one on one time with her to build the relationship with her.", "NTA. \n\nI would say it is time for everything to line up according to the reality of Arthur's life. There is a lot of ambiguity here that will only manifest itself in further problems in the future. \n\nArthur is never going back to live with Mom. OP and her husband and their daughter are his nuclear family in his mind. They should adopt Arthur. They should have all the power. \n\nCertainly Arthur and Gia should continue to call and visit each other but the people acting as parents almost as long as he can remember and into the future should be the legal parents at last. \n\nMoney is never mentioned but my guess is Gia pays little to no support. Gia has just been mostly out of the picture across the board. Threats of her interfering now are ridiculous. \n\nAdoption is everybody's way of doing what is best for Arthur.", "NTA, In Quebec where I live, kids can decide their primary caregiver without going to courts for custody starting age 12. I took that decision at 8 when I asked my dad to obtain my primary custody, he went to court for me because my mum didn't want to relinquish the cheque she received for 'my' care. The judge listened to me and allowed my dad custody \n\nHe is old enough to know what he wants in this matter. Furthermore, by forcing him to go at this delicate developmental period for him, with all the new hormones, feelings and all that come into could really impact him negatively if it is left to fester. \n\nGia is being incredibly selfish. He doesn't feel as is he has a place since she never made one for him in her life. I understand her situation is/was not easy, but it is unfair to expect adult reasoning from a 12 year old almost teen. She lacks empathy and sympathy and if she doesn't work on that rebuilding a relationship with him, she will lose him. Relationships work both ways and after 6 years not living with her, of course the bond diminished for him, especially since she does not seem to want to understand his perspective and putting all the rebuilding efforts on him. Furthermore, she already has a do over baby, and trust me, he sees it that way if not in those words so he most likely feels as if any place he would have would be taken by his sister, deservedly so, since to his eyes, his mom abandonned him when the going got tough.", "I haven't read other comments but please please please don't force this child to go visit his mom.\n\nNTA: TLDR.  (Trigger warning, vague mentions of false SA allegations) Basically there is some personal messy drama  similar to this situation and my ramblings on  why the child shouldn't be made to go. \n\nI've been through something similar. At 2 my grand parents took custody of me.  My mom was an addict and just didn't care to keep up with a kid.  I loved my grandparents.  Occasionally I'd see my mom, but like Gia, she never ever bothered to set up any place or space for me in her apartments.  Often I just slept on the floor or couch.  I didn't feel like she was my mom and I never felt like she cared about me.  \n\nAt 9 or 10 my mom got engaged to a upper upper middle class guy. He had some money and his own business but not like millionaire money lol.  Anyway,  he kept telling her it looked bad on him that she didn't have custody of me or my sister, his place had a bedroom just waiting for us, etc.  I don't think she really wanted us but just felt pressured because \"appearances\".   The issue was she had signed away her rights to me to my grandparents and my half sister split her time between his family and my mom's sister.  In order to get custody of me back my mom called the cops and said my grandfather was molesting me.  Why would they believe her, right? The thing is since I still spent a few nights randomly with her when she felt like it, she used things I said.  Like how I would sit on my pawpaw's lap every night while he watched the news.   Or sometime when I was scared I slept with my grandparents.  The cops came with my mom and jerkyface. My grandfather originally refused to let them take me. Guns were drawn. It was terrifying and heartbreaking. I still remember the stupid lady who interviewed me for over an hour with the stupid touch dolls.  It was only as an adult I realized how fubar that situation was. Because as a kid of course I would lie, yes I sat on my pawpaw's lap every night. I didn't realize how much they would misconstrue that.  My grandparents almost lost their house trying to get me back.  And I lost 12 years of time with my grandparents. They never talked to me again until my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer.  \n\nAll because I was encouraged, convinced, whatever to go spend time with this lady who said she was my mom.  \n\nIt's better to allow the child to grow up in a loving household feeling safe and secure in the attachments he has to people who love him.  He can later on decide if he wants to include his biological mom into the circle of people he cares for.  He can build a bond with her as an adult if he wants.  This period of time in his life is fragile. Foundations for personality and habits are being formed, puberty is coming, at this age peer groups are becoming more important as a way to establish a sense of self and confidence.   \n\nDo you really want those habits and traits to be formed by a person who can't even devote a little space to her son? Who calls him names when angry, because if he will talk to you that way, she talks to him that way. \n\nStop thinking of him as a child that you share custody of.  The truth is you don't share custody. You carry the full financial and legal responsibility.  This is your child. And your child is begging you not to go to a place he feels unwelcome and unwanted.  It doesn't matter what anyone else, relatives included, think about your decision.  And you've allowed his bio mom to think she has a say. She's built more and more attachment to him over the years. She decides when he comes and goes in her life.", "NTA.\n\nBe aware that, even though you have custody, you\u2019ve permitted those visits very regularly.  She can most likely get court mandated visitation.\nHe is not old enough to make the decision not to have a relationship with his mother.\nI suggest a compromise:  Do a family vacation for a week.  He\u2019ll get some one on one time with his mother, spend time with family, and not feel neglected.\nIn the event that your sister will not accept that, then she will be down to only seeing him for holidays.\n\nCurious though, have you sent him to therapy at all during this?   It would benefit him greatly, you\u2019d have an \u201coutside\u201d person that could assist in him communicating his feelings toward this and have his emotional needs met, and the court would (or should) take their advisement.\n\nAs always - document everything.", "Your NTA this is your sister problem it her choice that got her here. All she want is a another caretaker to help her after she abandoned him 6 years ago and if that not the truth that what Arthur feel it seem. Can\u2019t even accommodate him for his own space that sound like a take care of your brother for me at night. Idk what kind of relationship you expect him to form with this woman from a few visits a year.", "NTA he's old enough to not want to go. His mother signed away her rights and basically discarded him and he feels that. \n\nIf Gia really wanted to see him more often, he would have his own room at her place. My husband and I see my stepson in-person once per year if we are lucky (he lives 10 hours away and has a heavy sport schedule nearly year-round) but we still set up a bedroom for him and invite him out all the time.", "NTA. \n\nGia is blaming the wrong person here, which makes me think she\u2019s more upset about control than about the loss of her son. Not only did she give him up in the first place, but she failed to create an environment where he would want to visit her. Of course he doesn\u2019t want to go where he doesn\u2019t even have his own space, surrounded by people who are only a step above strangers.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the legal battle you may have to face; hopefully a lawyer will be honest with Gia about her chances of winning, or cost will be prohibitive. But your obligation is to your nephew (now son), not the woman who abandoned him. \n\nWith that said, I do recommend talking to him to see if there\u2019s an alternate way he would want to spend time with his mother. Would he be more receptive if she came to him? If athletic opportunities were scheduled during his visit? If the visit happened at a different time of year? Do Gia\u2019s other children ever go to a summer camp, such that he could have time with her without other kids around?? Maybe his teacher would even send the assignments so he could be homeschooled by her for one week out of the school year? (I knew kids who went on two-week vacations to Disney during the school year, and student athletes / musicians sometimes traveled for sporting/music events and didn\u2019t fall irrevocably behind). It sounds like currently, he doesn\u2019t want to sacrifice the fun part of his year to spend time somewhere less fun, but that may not mean he really wants less contact with her altogether.", "Absolutely NTA and Gia can go pound sand. She can take it up with Arthur, but not in an authoritative manner, but rather listening to his grievances. After that, unless he agrees, she should back off, period.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll need to understand that Gia IS NO LONGER HIS MOM. Gia gave him up. YOU ARE HIS MOM now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet Arthur decide.", "NTA. Since he can't get both his compromises, is it possible for you or your husband to go back with him? He can spend time with Gia during the day and then sleep at the hotel with you guys at night?", "So she gave up her rights to her oldest, because her new baby was so severely disabled, she couldn\u2019t handle both children. Yet she had a third, instead of asking her oldest to come back home? No wonder he doesn\u2019t feel he has a place with her. NTA and keep that boy safe.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA.", "NTA - it doesn't sound like Gia makes any effort to make Arthur feel welcome or enjoy his time with her. That is what should break your heart.", "No he is old enough to make that choice", "Definitely NTA", "NTA. Arthur is at an age where he is starting to be more autonomous. You need to consider what he's asking, and realize he may not view Gia as his mother. Biologically yes, but she abandoned him, and you were the ones that loved and cared for him unconditionally. The fact that he does to visit and feels like an outsider shows that she's not bonding with him, and that won't improve in the teenage years. I wouldn't bond with somebody I only see a couple times a year, especially if I feel like an after thought.", "NTA - especially after what she said I wouldn\u2019t let him go. She sounds like she\u2019d take off with him and you\u2019d never see the poor kid again.", "Ok first of all she is not his mother, you are. She signed the rights of him meaning she gave him away, sad for Arthur but is true and totally get why he feels that way\u2026 he is basically not wanted by his Bio Mom, but cannot really be part of your family because he has to go and see her and be reminded and she didn\u2019t want him and still doesn\u2019t because already has 2 more kids and never asked to have him back\n\nNTA he is your son and you do by him", "NTA. Please see it from his view; he hates going. He feels he made to go. It makes him unhappy. Forcing him to go to \"keep a bond\" with his bio mum isn't going to work. The fact he doesn't want to go and hasn't for a long time now, clearly shows he doesn't have a bond with his bio mum. And again, forcing him to go is only going to make that worse. When someone, of any age, doesn't want to be with someone or like doing said thing, will only have that become more hateful the more it happens, maybe pushing to LC or NC.\n\nAllowing him to do the things he'd prefer during this time is important for his growth. He can still call his bio mum for chats, and as he gets older he can decide if he really wants to have that \"bond\" with her. Because, if he's been going over for a long time, and at 12, doesn't feel any bond with her, but sees it as a punishment from you... clearly shows forcing won't make a change.\n\nBe his mum. Listen to his feelings.", "Quick question. Why does he call you Mom instead of Aunt even if you have custody? You're NTA regardless but you admitted that your sister needed help and went to family for support. You didn't state exactly why she signed over her rights but obviously it was what is best for the child at the time. As the aunt you chose to step up and help, but Auntie-Mom seems very confusing. It can come off as punishment for asking for help from bio-mom and nephew-son maybe won't understand the sacrifice for a better life ever. He can choose not to go regardless, but you saying that alone has my antennas up like what's happening with that.", "All of this. He\u2019s not a bookcase that you can leave at somebody else\u2019s house while you don\u2019t have room for it and then get it back when you\u2019re ready. He\u2019s a person, and he had a whole life and a whole family while Gia was getting her life together. He\u2019s not the same kid he was when she signed over her rights, and he\u2019s allowed to have feelings about what he\u2019s been through.", "OP, I'm honestly shocked this has gone on this long. Your son doesn't see this woman as a mom. She's basically an aunt he's forced to visit who sees him as more. He's putting his foot down, and that's completely okay. I would tell her that she can continue to visit, but he's a teenager with his own life and own friends, and you can't keep forcing him to visit.", "I think the answer here is that for her foreseeable future Gia comes to see Arthur and OP says they are happy to do what it takes to facilitate that. \n\nThat way Gia can\u2019t say she is being denied access and Arthur is being allowed to stay where he feels comfortable. \n\nNTA. Gia rant that YOU turned everyone against her, when really the parents etc made decisions based on Arthurs needs alone tells me she\u2019s not being reasonable. Her life became stable (for now) and she decided she\u2019d been wronged, rather than being honest with herself about what happened, and what was best for her and Arthur. As someone who has mental illness, that doesn\u2019t indicate to me someone who is going to stay stable and well.", "NTA\n\nI would have thought it unusual to force a child\u2019s relationship with their Bio mum.  \n\nGia formally signed her parental rights away, so she doesn\u2019t get to be furious. \n\nIf Arthur doesn\u2019t want to visit her, then so be it.  Good for you and your hubby for standing up for your son.\n\nI would suggest getting a lawyer to send Gia a cease and desist letter.", "I would add write down everything he says and give it to Gia and tell her \"This is why Arthur doesn't want to come visit, if you want him to come, I suggest you fix it\".", "[removed]", "I don\u2019t know how it works in the USA but in my country children of 12 and older are allowed to decline living somewhere or visiting someone, even their parent.

If he\u2019s comfortable with it you can discuss the issues with Gia and hopefully she will try to repair what\u2019s wrong instead of going after you", "There need to be a lot more video calls. Half an hour of Gina\u2019s attention twice a week is probably more than he gets when he\u2019s at her house.", "This bothers me too. She abandoned Arthur because life was too difficult, but Arthur still has to see her on a regular?  What gives her the right to demand this? It's a pretty entitled and outrageous demand, if I'm being totally honest.  Especially since she's shown that having two children living with her full time is not too much for her to handle.  I also don't understand all the comments suggesting various compromises, because the compromises ultimately favour Gia.  If Arthur doesn't want to go, it's my understanding that there's no legal requirement for him to go.  Why should the woman who abandoned him be accommodated, but not the child she abandoned?", "I offered to take Arthur and see Gia (he said he would go but he didn\u2019t want to stay with her or see his half siblings) but Gia wasn\u2019t receptive to the idea for reasons I understand (childcare, and her feeling like it\u2019s a cop out to see him for a few hours).

She calls and texts Arthur a lot but apparently he rarely answers and the only time he really speaks to her is when she calls him on my phone. He says he\u2019s busy and doesn\u2019t really have anything to talk to her about, which I get, because when I was his age I didn\u2019t really like having long conversations with relatives I rarely saw. They speak once or twice a week. \n\nObviously Gia has not been a fit or proper mother to Arthur, but I won\u2019t say it\u2019s all on him to maintain the relationship.

Yes the kid might not actually be physically sick but you do owe it to them to take it seriously that they don\u2019t feel up to going for a reason that feels real to them. \n\nI get that as a kid he wants to stay home. Here, he\u2019s got his friends, he can go where he wants when he wants because there\u2019s always someone to ferry him around, or he can walk places.

All this to go and stay at Gia\u2019s where he spends a week either sitting inside or going on trips to the local park. I get that it\u2019s not his idea of a good time and I get why it feels unfair that he has to do this four weeks out of the year. \n\nHe said if we went to Gia\u2019s country but he didn\u2019t have to stay with her or see his half siblings that would be okay. I was willing to do that but Gia isn\u2019t.", "He was in therapy until last year, because he said he didn\u2019t have much to say anymore and the therapist agreed.

On the couch? \n\nThese trips are probably just a constant reminder of how much of a burden he was considered by her and while yes, being a full time caregiver is incredibly demanding in every way, then why is she demanding he visits if she doesn't have the time nor money to have him there?\n\nAlso, considering how easily she started calling him names, I'd ask him how she speaks to him while he's there, cause it sounds like she's way too comfortable throwing that out there.", "Everyone is missing out on everything they aren\u2019t doing, 24/7.", "What relationship?

Everything you have mentioned about why Arthur doesn\u2019t want to go is perfectly reasonable and he is old enough that his wishes should be considered.

My thought hinges on the refusal to see her around his half-siblings.  I wouldn't be surprised if every time he goes back there, he is sub-consciously remembering her ignoring him in favor of his sibling to the point of being taken away from home. To now be required to go back to that environment, still have his bio-mom put all her focus on the other children in the home, being isolated from everyone who DOES choose him, and not even having his own private space there to grasp those feelings... I mean I think the resentment is there.  But he seems mature enough to not want that to be the case and is pointing out the many other very valid reasons to not be there.

Once this settles down we can maybe send him for a block of sessions to explore any new feelings. \n\nThat said, I do think a lot of this is that he finds his half siblings very annoying.

Because of this, he\u2019ll often volunteer to teach her to play video games or share things with her but only when he wants to. Gia takes a different approach, she lets the kids bother him and tries to force the bonding since they have such limited time together. She will force him to let the kids join in activities that aren\u2019t really appropriate which sometimes means things get ruined or broken etc. As a result, Arthur can\u2019t stand them.

I work with teenagers- forcing them into a relationship only makes it worse. They fight it like the devil, they resent it hugely and it doesn\u2019t build a bond. He is old enough to be listened to and his feelings are valid. Besides which, if he competes in sports then he has commitments in the holidays which require him to be there or lose his spot. It\u2019s in his best interests to concentrate on his education, work on his skills and hobbies, develop his peer relationships and enjoy time with his family.

Obtain statements from your parents too, in case she repeats these to Arthur during a visit so you can explain the situation completely and objectively.  However, short of forcing him, it's understandable that he doesn't want to leave his friends and family at every opportunity.  Is he comfortable presenting his side to Gia, even with a therapist or mediator available to support him?  Possibly if he can retain a couple of weeks that are important to him, he can compromise on visits for the other weeks.  There may be ways that Gia can find, with his input, to let him feel more welcomed and involved.  There are five years left of his visits, the same reason for leaving him with you is still valid, only now he is finding more stability in staying with his permanent family than with his original yet changing family.  This is normal and a good family therapist can help guide you all through the expectations of the next few years.", "Arthur is 12 and he's not stupid. He was there when he was moved over to your house, and he's spent half of his life with you.\n\nHe dislikes it at Gia's, and he's seen Gia move on and have *another* child with someone new. If he feels it's a \"punishment\" because he's not your biological child, I worry what comments he's heard while over there, or what \"responsibilities\" he's been given, especially since he has two younger \"siblings.\" \n\nLet's be honest: if Gia was *sooo* concerned about Arthur, she would have breeched this conversation ***way*** sooner.

Just less travel involved as we live in the same state.\n\nI love my kid and I appreciate that it\u2019s important for him to see his father. I also appreciate that he doesn\u2019t always want to go.

When he\u2019s older we will be more skeptical but these years are important for his core education, we feel. \n\nArthur has said before (we have had conversations about how he doesn\u2019t answer Gia\u2019s calls or texts) that he doesn\u2019t understand why he has to have a relationship with her and he has nothing to talk to her about. I don\u2019t know what to tell him.

She was functionally neglecting Arthur to the point that his school was getting involved. A few more months and it would have been social services. She was pressured by the fact that she was not coping and not anywhere near providing a nurturing environment for her son. She did a selfless thing by letting him live with us and I give her credit for that but she also created an untenable situation for herself and her child. It is not anyone else\u2019s fault that he doesn\u2019t live with her. \n\nShe can resent me all she likes but I took responsibility for her child when she wouldn\u2019t. As a mother she should be cognisant of that before she places blame. It is not about what sucks for her it is about what is best for her son, and I believe that at age 12 that\u2019s having a say over how he spends his time. \n\nI don\u2019t have anything to make amends with Gia for.

My older brother played football so that left a lot of Fridays out. I had extra-curricular things like 4-H as well. \n\nThe kids start growing up and can go places themselves and want to do things with friends. At that point, the parents should be traveling to visit them and attend their events. My dad didn't. He just pouted and then wrote us off for 14 years because we didn't answer a letter quickly enough (in the 1970s when long-distance calling was expensive.)\n\nI guess kids are supposed to abandon their activities half of the time. There's nothing that can change growing up and the late teen years are when the kids are separating from their parents and moving to more independence. They don't want to spend more time with either parent and choose their friends over family all the time.", "Would it be possible for you, your daughter and Arthur to go to Gia's together?  That way you could all stay in a hotel, he could be with you and his sister, but also see Gia a bit?  You could all have a day out with her and her other kids, go for some meals, etc.?  It could be costly, but maybe it would be a good compromise?", "What is he missing out on? Weeks of feeling like nobody he loves really loves him back?  \n\n\nYou need to stop thinking that Gia really cares much about Arthur as a person: he's some kind of symbol/game piece in her game of life, and he deserves so much more.", "I suspect that you are over-reacting to the idea of the statement, and that it is \\*you\\* who fears what might come out in \"public\" about Gia's treatment of your son.  \n\n\nI know. Family stuff can be hard.  \n\n\nI think Arthur is not the one who would be traumatized - he's already told you enough about what visits to Gia's place are like for him that you know, deep down, that the details are probably pretty horrendous.  \n\n\nThis may sound harsh but you need to decide who really needs protection here: Arthur, Gia, or you?", "A one off appointment with the same person might be helpful for him to order his thoughts on the issue and how to communicate it to Gia without your involvement. My bonus kid did that a couple of times with his therapist after he was done with regular sessions when his biomom was not listening to him well on issues.", "She signed her parental rights away, right?\n\nIf so, I'm pretty sure you no longer need her consent.", "I do not know at this point that you would be putting him through anything that he would not want. I also suspect as No Consideration says below your chances would be good of winning in a court case.", "If she ends up agreeing, and you do take him, make sure to take your legal paperwork that you and your husband have custody of him. Because I foresee her causing issues once he's in her home.", "Which is on her. (Also my bonus kid didn\u2019t respond to texts or anything when he was that age. Seems normal.)", "At least she's trying and he knows she's trying. Right now that might seem like nagging but later on he'll look back and see it differently. \n\nDistance makes the usual custody stresses harder.", "As OP has confirmed, Gia's financial situation isn't the same. If she doesn't have space it makes sense she *can't* make space for Arthur to have his own room. You can't magically create a pack-away bedroom for someone in a 2 bedroom place (*if* that is the case for Gia). There are plenty of kids who share or have shared a bedroom with a sibling.\n\nIf it's a small space of course you can't keep other kids from bothering one 100%. It's going to happen.\n\nNone of that translates to being a bad parent. It does however translate the hardships she's having. If Arthur had never left and lived like this full time, would you still say she was a bad parent that didn't need to have her son?", "I think you need to remember that a lot of the decisions she made for Arthur\u2019s benefit, led to this moment. Giving you parental responsibility so you could move to a better situation for your family, was best for him at the time, but it also meant she couldn\u2019t spend much time with him easily and he got use to a more affluent and attentive lifestyle. Not bringing him back once her situation was stable because he was already in school meant she doesn\u2019t have his friends or extracurriculars near her for him to enjoy. His reasoning for not wanting to visit are directly tied to things she thought were to his benefit. Of course she is upset. I\u2019m not going to give any judgement, because I think all of you have tried to do the best for Arthur, and like every parent you all failed a little bit. \n\nYou consider Arthur your son, which is awesome, but your situation once you moved I think needed a bit more facilitation on your part to keep the mother-child-sibling mental bonding in an unusual situation. And that isn\u2019t any kind of major criticism just one of those little things that have bigger consequences then we realize, just like she probably should have brought him home even if he had started school, because he now has no life near her, and she has limited opportunities to be in his life. If you were a 1/2 drive away and he still lived with you I think this scenario would be very different. \n\nWhat you have now on both sides is unintentional consequences, and I think getting him back in periodic (every 1 or 2 months) therapy right now to help him see her perspective on choices she made, how he feels about those choices, and then when she comes to visit next, an appointment with both of them together so the therapist can help facilitate a conversation between them. I don\u2019t think the two of them or really the 3 of you are having the same conversation at the moment. We as humans don\u2019t always understand that what we are actually saying, what we think we are saying, and what others are hearing us say, are not always the same thing. He\u2019s at a good age to learn that, and it is also a good life skill in general, and I think it will help his mom not regret the choices she made that she thought was to his benefit if she can see that he understands what she was trying to do even if the results or his feelings towards her are not what she thought they would be. 9 out of 10 times you can shut down a conflict just by making sure both parties feel heard, even if you can\u2019t solve the underlying problem. That\u2019s where I would focus at the moment, and Arthur is at the age where you can explain this to him that these appointments are temporary and for the very specific purpose of having a conversation during his mom\u2019s next visit to you, to make sure they can accurately express their feelings to each other and come up with a better visitation plan now that he is getting older.", "I think part of the problem is how the adult see the situation verse how Arthur sees it. Arthur likely doesn't see your stepsister as his mum anymore and more like an aunt and sees you as his mother like he sees your daughter as his sister. This isn't that surprising you have effectively been his mother for the last 6 years which is half his life and is the half he better remembers. How much do you remember from the age of say 2-6 compared to 6-12. My bet is he doesn't view it as having lived equally with first her and then with you and that doesn't even get into the complex feelings he probably had/has of feeling abandoned by her and the messy home environment he had before that living with her. \n\nThis is were the problem lies all the adults see it as having Arthur spend time with his mother but he probably sees it as being sent off by his family aka you and your husband to some relatives place where he probably doesn't have any friends while his sister gets to spend time at home and hangout with friends like a normal kid would. \n\nMaybe in the future it will changes and he can see both you and your stepsister as mother figures in his life but he doesn't know and he probably feels a relationship is being forced on him that he doesn't want right know. I kinda feel bad for Gia but forcing the relationship won't help and will probably only build up resentment in him towards her as he becomes a teenager and desires more freedom.", ">Arthur said he would be okay with visiting if he.... didn\u2019t have to see his half siblings. \n\nThis concerns me. How old are his half siblings? And why doesn't he want to see them?", "\u00ab\u00a0I am happy to take him and stay nearby so Gia can have day visits but Gia wasn\u2019t receptive to this when it was suggested.\u00a0\u00bb \nThat is a wonderful compromise you are offering!   Maybe review that again with Gia; once she understands that you won\u2019t force Arthur to go visit and stay at Gia\u2019s home, she might accept your compromise. Also, ask her why she objects to your compromise? It might help work things out. And gets Arthur views too. Staying with you might give Arthur the space he needs from his half siblings as he wouldn\u2019t be with them  day and nights", "I think you are undervaluing the issue of his own space and the way his personal boundaries are ignored when he is there. That\u2019s never comfortable and he\u2019s absolutely at an age where those things seem extra important.", "The simplest thing in that case might be for you to arrange for a one off appointment with his therapist and explain to him that you want him to talk over the potential consequences and so on with someone who is basically a neutral third party and that once he has done that you will be happy to enforce his request no matter what it is. In that way you can feel confident he is considering things fully without him feeling like you are trying to pressure him one way or the other.\n\nWe did this sort of thing with bonus kid and we were very frank about why we were doing it - wanting to make sure he had an opportunity to talk things through with an adult without having to worry about saying something that might upset someone or potentially feeling pressured one way or another because we were involved and so it\u2019s natural to care what we think/want him to do. Seemed to work well, he\u2019s 18 now and seems to be doing pretty well emotionally and with establishing healthy boundaries with his biomom and feeling able to communicate with us.", "Gia would feel like she is being punished for asking for help. It's your choice regardless but that is why she would throw it back in your face when she gets upset. It all sounds nice but mentally, it comes off as weird that's why I asked. The aftermath of some decisions to give Arthur whatever he wants can get crazy and Gia can use that against you claiming manipulation. And you do feel some type of way about it because you said it when you didn't have to.", "That sounds like more than enough contact!", "So you're not at all keeping Gia from her kid, then, simply respecting Arthur's wishes. Firmly NTA", "Sounds like a her problem. This is not yours or his problem to fix. \nHe doesn\u2019t want to go. Period. He clearly said no.\nIf she wants to see him she has to come to him.\nIt\u2019s up to her. Sure it might not be easy. Maybe she has to pay for childcare or maybe the grandparents can help. Whatever the solution, it\u2019s up to her to find it.\n\nNTA", "This was my thought. She should be told that she's very welcome to visit him, but that OP won't force him to visit her because *he* doesn't want to.", "NTA.  You could also volunteer to set up a group mediation or family counseling. However, Gia should be interested in seeing Arthur's interests & meeting his friends to find out more about his life, instead of forcing him to fit in with hers each visit.  She also had time between his placement and new fiance & baby to look at more custody and chose not to.  At 13 years old a judge will ask him more questions and will also wonder why she/her new family never visits him either. Either way, get a lawyer.  Also, who pays for the airfare etc to visit?  If you, tell her you're putting that $$$ towards the lawyer so she'll have to pay going forward until legal fees are paid up.  And she'll have 6 years of child support to come up with, too, as you're not a permanent babysitter.", "You'd be surprised what some judges will do.  \n\n\nSure: logic says keep the kid where he's happy and thriving.  \n\n\nIdeology says: I know better than logic and common sense and I think biology trumps everything.  \n\n\nSo make Gia do the heavy lifting, OP. Get a lawyer well-versed in the laws where you live, tell her she can come and visit any time (but keep Arthur's passport where she can't get it, like a safety deposit box), and see if she actually tries to fight it.", "She gave us parental responsibility, which is the authority to make decisions in loco parents, that\u2019s not the same as relinquishing parental rights completely. She is still legally his mother.", "Yes. Gia is not listening to him, she is not respecting him as an independent person. I wouldn\u2019t make bonus kid go to his mom\u2019s house if she was treating him like that.", "My son's virtual therapist couldn't even practice if we crossed state lines, I imagine it's even less likely between countries", "OP has said that Gia explicitly does not tell his siblings to leave him alone when he wants to be left alone, she allows them to continuing bothering him, perhaps thinking it will somehow help them develop a sibling bond. That is not \u2018well you can\u2019t keep kids separate 100% of the time\u2019 that is actively treating him like his comfort doesn\u2019t matter at all. And yes, if she was treating him like that and he\u2019d never left, I would still say she is being a bad parent. He has a right to have boundaries, she should not be putting her imagined sibling relationships ahead of what he is saying he is comfortable with.\n\nFurther, he\u2019s only there for a relatively short period of time, she can figure something out that will give him some privacy. Even just hanging a couple curtains up can make a big difference in defining space. My parents built a little room at one end of the living room for my step brother when my dad suddenly got full custody at around that age, until they could find a bigger place they could afford.", "I understand why she is upset but honestly, I\u2019m our conversation she took no responsibility for her choices, which are what led to her not having custody of Arthur in the first place. She said she was pressured, that I stole her baby, that I turned him against her\u2026at no point did she acknowledge that nobody but her created a situation where her son couldn\u2019t live with her. That doesn\u2019t sit right with me. I have always given her credit for making decisions in Arthur\u2019s best interests, but as it doesn\u2019t sit well with me that now that Arthur has a view on what his interests are, she\u2019s calling him (and me) names. \n\nI totally take on board what your saying about therapy and we will definitely look at getting him back in for a couple of sessions at least to talk things through. \n\nThat said, I have to respectfully disagree that Gia should have taken him back. That\u2019s a matter of opinion I guess but I genuinely believe Arthur is better off living with us. Im not going to take credit for the great kid he\u2019s growing into because I\u2019m sure he would have turned out that way anyway but he has access to a wonderful education, he is able to pursue a passion that costs tens of thousands that he otherwise wouldn\u2019t have access to, he has the one on one attention he deserves, he has a present and attentive father figure. None of that he would have had if he lived with Gia. And I understand that this has meant Gia is not in his life as much as she\u2019d liked but I stay by that he\u2019s better off here. And it\u2019s not as if she raised any idea of having custody of him before she wasn\u2019t getting what she wanted, so until now she agreed that he\u2019s better off here. \n\nI just feel that I\u2019m doing him a disservice forcing him to go, because I wouldn\u2019t do that to my daughter. I wouldn\u2019t do that to myself. I wouldn\u2019t put myself through the ordeal of going somewhere I feel uncomfortable, so what right to do I have to ask that of him? We trust Arthur with his own safety, with a vehicle, we expect him to take responsibility for himself in so many ways on a daily basis, except when it matters to him apparently? That doesn\u2019t seem fair.", "They\u2019re 8 and 3. \n\nHe finds them very annoying. The elder has a severe disability and is developmentally delayed, and the 3 year old is\u20263, and Gia is not diligent about enforcing boundaries because \u201cthey\u2019re siblings and siblings fight. They just want to spend time with him\u201d. While that\u2019s all true, Arthur doesn\u2019t want to play with them and they don\u2019t leave him alone, and now he can\u2019t stand them.", "Name those \"thousand ways\".", "By the time this gets to that point in court he will probably be 14ish.", "She chose not to go for more custody because Arthur was already settled at home and in school and no one wanted to disrupt that. \n\nShe and her partner plus the other kids come to us for two weeks in the summer and two weeks at Christmas which is almost all the holiday time they have. They pay for their own airfare when they come, we pay for Arthur\u2019s airfare when he visits. We have never and would never ask her for a penny. We agreed to take care of him so his expenses are our expenses.", "You\u2019d hope they wouldn\u2019t have the child back but honestly you\u2019d think a judge would see right through the fact that for 6 years she\u2019s been happy with this arrangement and only now she is crying coercion because he no longer wants to visit in the holidays. So unless she has mentioned wanting to go to court prior to this she hasn\u2019t bothered in the previous 6 years to get him back. She even went and had another child. Doesn\u2019t seem like he was a high priority.", "It almost sounds like she wants him over there to help her with her disabled child and toddler. If that's the case it's completely unfair to Arthur. I don't blame him for wanting nothing to do with the situation.", "I have to wonder if she puts responsibility onto Arthur to help manage her own responsibilities and she's mad about losing her free help.", "Don\u2019t send him to a place where people don\u2019t respect his boundaries. That\u2019s pretty simple. He is saying \u2018no\u2019 and Gia is not listening and is not making the other kids listen. Do you want to teach him that people don\u2019t have to respect his \u2018no\u2019 on this kind of thing?", "Ok. Well, I think you'd win in court because he's been with you so long already and he wants to be with you. I think you'd have a fair chance.", "I think everyone has been coasting along on reactions after Gia's second child was born and the fact that Arthur was a child who would do what he was told. Well now he is older and time has passed. You all have spent six years not thinking about him being eternally split between two unequal worlds. Whatever takes you sister tells herself she hasn't been Mom for years and will never be again. She is demanding sacrifices from all of you she really cannot justify. What is the payout ever going to be for anyone in your family by you hanging back and not making Arthur your second child under the law as he is in real life? \n\nI suspect Arthur will only express more sorrow and discontent and Gia will make more problems as her control is challenged. Arthur might even bring up adoption himself.\n\nI wish you good luck. You and your husband stepped up to the plate magnificently when called upon. You could not have done any better.", "Gia has a simple solution in front of her: make everyone respect Arthur\u2019s boundaries and find a way to give him his own space. Those are completely reasonable things for him to want. Until she figures that out, no visits for her.", "And he can't even get away from them by going to his room. Poor kid. He's 12, he needs his own space. This will only get worse for him as he gets older. And if she continues to force him, she will lose him as soon as he's legally able to kick her out of his life. \n\nWhy didn't she make sure he had his own space? That would make things better.\n\nWhy don't the two step-siblings share a room while he's there so he can have his own space? \n\nThere are so many options but your sister seems to only want it her way with no consideration for her son's feelings.", "Not just that, but how much you wanna bet that, on the rare occasion she doesn't ignore him, she tries to force him into a caretaker role as well?", "Exactly this. I've been skimming to see if anyone would mention this because it really changed my evaluation. She had time to go have another kid, who made it to toddler age, before reaching towards her already existing kid??? Not to mention the fact that there was a whole other at least 3-4y between her giving her baby boy up (during his formative years at that) and having another.\n\nI don't fault her for having a hard time. I don't fault her for not being mentally well enough or having enough time to take care of Arthur. However, she should have regained custody of her kid before going off to have another. I'd feel like a second thought to her new setup in his case and wouldn't want to be over there with people I don't know and have no time for me anyway.", "I want to feel sympathy for her, since she's obviously had a rough time. I really do.\n\nBut the fact she chose to have a third kid, when she was struggling with two to the point she gave up custody of Arthur, and did so with someone working too much to help, it makes her complaining feel like professional martyrdom.\n\nThe fact she doesn't come to him, it's Arthur being uprooted to visit her, really doesn't help.", "I was waiting to see if someone would bring this little aspect up.\n\nNTA.  OP wants what is best for the kid.  Gia just thinks the kid is hers therefore he should do what she wants.", "The third came well after custody for Arthur was relinquished. She did not just keep 'popping babies out' She had one child with a new and apparently stable and responsible partner. And really, it appears the toddler is the least of the worries.", "What's gonna happen? His bio mother will abandon him again?", "According to OP, the toddler is one of the reasons she can't visit as often and can't devote attention to Arthur while he's there. So it's still a problem that she had another kid. Doesn't seem like she asked for Arthur back either, which is shitty in its own right -- she either can take care of the disabled kid plus another one but doesn't want him and wants to start fresh with a kid from the new guy or she can't take care of two kids and had the third kid anyway, which may well end up being fobbed off on OP like before. \n\nShe clearly doesn't have Arthur's best interests in mind so that's not why she didn't ask for him back.", "I was referring to the court proceedings and everything involved.", "Yeah, it feels like when she reached stability, instead of trying to be a better bioparent/aunt/whatever to Arthur, she instead had another baby which set her back at least several steps, since now she yet again can't take care of all her children. \n\nIt might not be spooting out babies every ten minutes, but it's a worrying sign, since we've seen plenty of examples where this is step one of a very bad pattern."]}
