Your wife actually has no rights to it at all, so gifting her 30% is a rather large gift to my thinking.\n\nI would tend to think - max out money for both of your retirement savings (at least 8k - 2k ira/2k roth for each - maybe add an additional year to make it 16k), 15k for your parents, 25k for emergency savings, and split what's left.\n\nNTA for not gifting in-laws though.", "NTA but you are being quite dumb. This is not free money like winning the lottery. You shouldn\u2019t give any of this money away. It needs to be put into a savings account and not touched unless it\u2019s for health problems.

You are right, if she wants to help her parents then she can give them some of her money.", "You are not selfish to keep this money and put it in a very very stable high interest yielding account. This money is meant for you and you\u2019re going to need it as you get older. Investing the bulk of it will mean in 10 years you\u2019ll be able to be a little bit generous if you want to.\n\nUnless your family has lent you significant amounts of money to Live before the settlement came in, then please do everybody a favor, and be smart with it.", "This is what I don\u2019t understand. Why give money to your wife? Aren\u2019t you a team? If I was you any money I keep for myself is automatically my wife\u2019s. There is no my money and her money, it\u2019s our money. When my father passed away I was left with about $250k. I paid off our house, our debts bought a car with her input  and bankrolled our savings account. Never a 2nd thought.

And with her bugging you about sending some to her parents I\u2019m probably right.", "Came here to say the same thing. I have family members in the legal profession so these kinds of hypotheticals come up all the time over dinner and stuff. That money is for future medical care for the rest of your life. This is includes physical and mental health. It's not intended to be given away and spent on non-essentials. I really think you need a financial advisor here and a discussion with your medical and legal teams. They gave you a large sum of money for a reason. I'm concerned that you don't understand the full implications of your accident.", "I\u2019m glad to see this response. I have a very close friend who worked both in workman\u2019s comp insurance and in mass tort/class action law as a plaintiff\u2018s attorney, and I\u2019ve heard enough of their (very common) horror stories. Not saving the majority of the settlement against future health issues is not the smartest move here.", "I was thinking the same thing. My dad was in a similar situation and blew through his money. Then, years later. started having medical problems and needing surgeries and couldn't work. He had nothing saved.", "Agreed! I'm in a country with universal healthcare and benefits through work and I still just dropped almost $1000 on medical treatment that isn't covered but I absolutely need. Save your money OP!", "Agree. OP's arrangements would maybe make sense if this was a lottery. But these are for past present and future medical expenses and should not be shared as if it's a windfall from heaven to make everyone else's lives easier. It is compensation for their accident.", "100% of this. Current Adjuster here. \n\nThis money is meant to cover everything to do with this injury forever. You could run into issues when you are older if Medicare gets wind of it. Put it away for anything to do with your injuries. \n\nKeep it separate from your joint finances. Use it to cover any FMLA time, medical treatment, etc. That's what it's for.", "I agree with putting it away for future need.  If OP insists on dividing it, tell your wife you are 100% ok with her giving a part or all of her $30k to her parents.", "That was exactly my thought. She's daft for doing anything except save / invest it. This wasn't a lottery win...", "I also worked in workers comp for awhile and agree with this post. (Not a lawyer, not legal advice).", "This. Why are you giving your wife a huge chunk of money for a presumedly traumatic injury you suffered?\n\nIf you are Already paying for your parents expenses, i guess it makes sense to help them with this if you\u2019re paying for their stuff regardless. But this isn\u2019t fun money", "This is a good advice. \n\nA friend of mine had breast cancer. She had a good life insurance and it payed  out a lump sum. She used it for treatment and covering life expenses while she couldn't work. Thankfully, everything went fine and she is healthy at the moment. She decided to spend the leftover money on a new car for her 18 year old daughter, and all along I am thinking how she can't get such good insurance terms with her cancer history anymore and what will happen if it comes back. Tried talking to her about it, she shut it down immediately saying that she doesn't appreciate the \"negativity\".\n\n Oh well...I apologized and let it rest and hope everything will be ok, because if it isn't, she'll be in lot of financial trouble.", "Great point. OP, this is a payout for an injury, not a lotto prize or casino winnings. Don\u2019t be foolish.

A huge settlement (depending on the location of OP) usually includes past and future medical, past and future pain and suffering, loss of earning capacity, loss of ability to enjoy life, etc. Several of these factors come into play in the future and OP needs to be cognizant of them now. If OP had surgeries, often scar tissue forms and combined with natural aging, creates problems down the road, even if he \"healed well\" at present. Were pins/rods placed, they can become displaced.

Especially as the primary breadwinner, it's important to have that security in case that accident takes OP out of commission and suddenly the primary source of income for the house is gone. The settlement helps provide that security, especially because most settlements are final and once that money is gone there's no coming back for more.", "What assumptions are being made here?", "You're responding to someone who is responding to someone who is making a YTA judgment and defending their statement.
