They are doing you the favor of attending, witnessing your nuptials, then getting on with their own lives.

I was the single sibling at my brother's wedding. It was one of the worst days of my life. I had just been fired because I was a whistle blower. The other bride's mades bullied me.

I am happy to have supported them in this way. But I can't lie, it traumatized me. I had literal flashbacks, not because it was so terrible, but because I was expected to just not feel anything that I was feeling on that day.   \n\n\nI know this comment is going to be down voted all over the place, but I hope the OP hears me anyways and does something, ANYTHING to make her wedding day a good day for her sister as well.

You're having disputes about dresses, flowers, and everything else? That means she is helping you plan the wedding. You don't seem to appreciate it at all (rude), but the fact is she is working hard on this event for you.\n\nIt's also pretty rude to expect people in your wedding party to attend alone if they have a significant other. They are your guests of honor - the least you could do is let them bring their dance partner.\n\nIt seems like you just dislike her boyfriend, but that's honestly not a good reason to exclude him.

In that case some of the bride's family rsvp'ed that they wouldn't be able to attend and then the bride and moh asked if I wanted to bring someone. I've had other times when I didn't get a plus one as well. One of these was a close friend's wedding that I attended with several other lady friends. So I don't think it is necessarily uncommon. It's also fair for someone to opt out of attending if they choose to do so because their partner wasn't invited. Both sides can be disappointed and both are valid. \n\nIMO the issue here is that the bride doesn't like her sister's boyfriend. The dynamic between the sisters is complicated by the fact that the sister has been overstepping and being an asshole about the bride's wedding for some time.

Because I assume that your sister knows her boyfriend, so he is not a stranger *to her*. He may be to you, but not to her. Are your guests only allowed to bring their +1s on the condition that you know them? Say you have a close friend who lives far away from you. Say she is traveling to attend the wedding, and also bringing her partner. So she can't do that because YOU haven't met him and he is a stranger *to you*?
