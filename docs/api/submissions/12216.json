They are doing you the favor of attending, witnessing your nuptials, then getting on with their own lives.

I was the single sibling at my brother's wedding. It was one of the worst days of my life. I had just been fired because I was a whistle blower. The other bride's mades bullied me.

I am happy to have supported them in this way. But I can't lie, it traumatized me. I had literal flashbacks, not because it was so terrible, but because I was expected to just not feel anything that I was feeling on that day.   \n\n\nI know this comment is going to be down voted all over the place, but I hope the OP hears me anyways and does something, ANYTHING to make her wedding day a good day for her sister as well.

You're having disputes about dresses, flowers, and everything else? That means she is helping you plan the wedding. You don't seem to appreciate it at all (rude), but the fact is she is working hard on this event for you.\n\nIt's also pretty rude to expect people in your wedding party to attend alone if they have a significant other. They are your guests of honor - the least you could do is let them bring their dance partner.\n\nIt seems like you just dislike her boyfriend, but that's honestly not a good reason to exclude him.

I\u2019m a bridesmaid for two weddings in October. For one of the couples, for a partner to be invited they have to have been together by at least the beginning of this year. I was helping with something on the guest list recently and my BF and I are the shortest term couple being invited and we will have been together 11 months at that point. For the other couple, they have set it at 1 year together by the wedding and they have met the partner. Thankfully my BF and I are both bridal party (this couple introduced us) because otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have gotten to bring each other.", "I find it mind-boggling that this seems to be so common and accepted on reddit. Maybe it's a regional thing?", "I saw that; but I\u2019m curious\u2026 recently someone referred to six months as a few.", "I mean for us it was just a polite/fair way to keep the guest list short.", "I mean....at least PART of the wedding is about your guests' happiness. Don't you want them to enjoy themselves???", "and op's sister is not making it about herself, she merely says: make your choice, you get either both or neither. simple as that.", ">...actually, it is. that's the whole point of a wedding.\n\nActually, the bridal party are guests of honor too. Efforts should be made to honor and show appreciation for their presence and their support for the bride and groom.", "There I thought the point of a wedding was to publically celebrate two people deciding to commit to a life together. And in many religions, also a ritual that bonds the commitment from wordly to spiritual.   \n\n\nSometimes, being \"wrong\" in some people's opinion is exactly the RIGHT thing to be.", "also pretty common to stick up for your SO and then say: your choice, we come as package deal and not have any problems with it.  \n\n\nit is an invitation, not a summons and sister can easily say: reason X = I won't waste my time at your wedding.", "It's common among rude, cheap people.", "My family has this rule. Unless a person is engaged they are not invited to the wedding or reception. And my family is huge.", "I would never do this. It implies that they don't matter.", "Doesnt make it any less lame.", "I just get bad vibes from him. Even disregarding the age gap, in the times I've interacted with him his behavior has been less than stellar.", "shes 24, hes 37, I'm on OP's side regardless. Your wedding, invite who you want.", "When planning our guest list, I absolutely did that. We had less than 40 people at our wedding and I have known all of them, including the partners that attended, for years. We didn\u2019t offer plus ones to people if we did have a relationship with their partners. \nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with preferring a more intimate gathering with people you know. \nBut we also made it clear to everyone before we even finalised the guest list. It shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s thrown in at the last minute after the rest of the plans are finalised.", "I dont see why this makes her an AH. She is basing her choice to invite couples vs individuals based on she and her fiance's relationships with both members of the couple. If the person invited has a partner that they are not close to, that partner is not invited. That's reasonable, especially for small weddings", "Sure, but you also can't be disappointed when someone doesn't come either. OP is allowed to invite whoever she wants for any reason, but those people are allowed to decline the invitation for any reason as well.", "I guess it just seems rude/ cheap /tacky to invite someone to a party and refuse to let them bring a date? Isn't it general manners to not refuse one side of a couple an invitation? At the very least, you can't be upset if someone decides not to come.", "When i said SO, i meant life partner, not boyfriend or guy whom you randomly date.", "Does this change for you if the person has to travel a long distance or doesn't know any of the other guests?", "Then maybe it's a new thing. I don't know. I got married 11 years ago, and I wanted people to have fun. Everyone likes having someone to dance with. It wasn't a huge wedding but I was happy to give a \"plus one\" to a few people that wanted it.", "Yeah, it would definitely be seen as cheap (at best) to rude (at worst) where I grew up.", "I know, I don't get it either.", "That\u2019s fine. And I get wanting to limit the list. But that\u2019s a pretty arbitrary way to limit the list, IMO. What about people who have been together for years and years, but choose not to marry?", "You mean cheap and tacky, right?", "and neither of the two people making that commitment and being celebrated is the bride's sister. \n\nbut thank you for my daily dose of obtuse, i nearly missed it. much like you missed the actual question being posed to you.", "If that\u2019s how her sister wants to proceed then sure.", "In my circles it\u2019s considered tacky to expect an invitation for a new boyfriend/girlfriend. Wedding etiquette is clearly not universal.", "so a cost saving measure", "I mean\u2026they kind of don\u2019t. Harsh to say but unless it\u2019s a long term partner that\u2019s the reality. Maybe they\u2019ll stay together and he\u2019ll become an important person to the family, but for now he isn\u2019t.", "Also pretty lame to pay to host people you don\u2019t know or like.", "More than enough reason not to want him at your wedding.", "Are you also limiting your husband's guests based on these same protocols?  I imagine you don't have the sort of relationship you are describing with every guest he wants to invite.  Seems like an arbitrary line you are drawing against your sister.", "Look, I totally get being protective. I'm an older sibling myself, and I've not been happy with my sister's SO choices before. \n\nBut have you considered she might be so upset because she feels like you are trying to coerce her out of a relationship she wants? For better or worse, she clearly likes this person and wants to spend time around him, which you are essentially trying to prevent under the guise of, well, I don't know him.", "NTA\n\nBUT\n\nWill you be with your sister for every moment of the evening? Will his presence take her away from you? If not, reconsider. It sounds like you truly want her there. Don't look at it as \"giving in\" to her - look at it as a gesture that you take her relationship seriously and that you support her. You can work around his presence in photographs also. Take pictures with specific groups of people. If you hired a photographer, politely request they limit shots of him (discreetly!!!) It might be worth it in the long term if only to allow her some company while you enjoy your evening.", "OK, and you'd be totally cool with your husband being excluded from family events because she decided tomorrow she gets \"bad vibes\" from him? At the end of the day, it's your party and you can invite who you like, but you can't get bent out of shape if she decides to pass on coming.", "But you're not the one in a relationship with him. She is. I get the whole \"It's your day, your rules\" thing but I can't blame her for being upset that her SO isn't welcome at her sister's wedding. Who wants to dance by themselves? I feel like you're not thinking of her happiness at all. Again, yup, it's you're day....but that doesn't mean you're not an AH.", "So not only are you cheap and tacky, you are lying to your sister on why you won't allow her to bring her partner to a celebration of partnerships?", "So you are against consenting adults choosing who they want to spend THEIR time with?  NAH.", "But you would have accepted if they didn\u2019t want to go without their partner, right? That\u2019s where the problem is here. The bride wants to exclude the partner, fair enough. But the sister gets to decide not to go too.", "Sure. I just think as a sibling to the bride/groom not going because your brand new SO isn\u2019t invited is a silly hill to die on.", "Depends on the size of the event and the purpose. \u201cHey come celebrate X with my because you matter to me\u201d? No I wouldn\u2019t think it rude not to invite my husband, especially if they aren\u2019t close.", "Ok but that\u2019s what we\u2019re taking about in OP\u2019s post - her sister\u2019s new bf of a few months.", "Maybe, but that\u2019s a different ask. \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to be traveling for this and I won\u2019t really know anyone else there and I\u2019m going to be uncomfortable on my own\u201d is not the same thing as \u201cI\u2019m invited therefore my SO who you\u2019ve never met/barely know must be invited\u201d. And the size of the event would still matter too. A hundred people? Ok maybe just let them bring a +1. My wedding where it was a total of 14 people INCLUDING myself, my husband, the photographer (a friend from HS) and the officiant (my brother)? No", "I think it is a newer thing. I first heard of it for a wedding 5 years ago when my cousin was getting married and didn\u2019t want the flavors of the month from her cousins on the other side of her family. Now it\u2019s been the case for every post-Covid wedding I\u2019ve been invited to.", "We didn\u2019t have any primary invitees that were in that situation.", "I could pay for a wedding or have a down payment on a house.  Sorry I was more interested in providing my new family with a home than buying drinks for random people.", "In mine, every single person gets a plus-one unless they are underage and attending with their parents.", "oh you mean to say that you do not grasp +1 as a concept ?", "Even lamer yet to have to deal with the consequences of her own actions. Big sis has every right to deny lil sis a plus one, but big sis has zero right to complain if lil sis says thanks but no thanks to her wedding bc of it. Sometimes couples are a package deal. it's this whole thing called \"commitment\".", "AND in the pictures forever\u2026\u2026.", "There's a WORLD of difference between your spouse's wedding guests and your sibling's \ud83d\ude44", "A boyfriend of a few months is different than a husband.", "Why do you think a small wedding is cheap and tacky, you\u2019ve commented this a few times?", "OP is a consenting adult AND the hostess of the party. She is deciding not to invite him. Sister can make her decisions, too.", "And I can't imagine not giving immediate family members a +1? I come from a different culture, but here wedding party and close family are always given a +1 out of respect, so I can see how it reads as rude, but I know OP has her reasons.", "OK, but if anyone invited decided to decline to come, they're perfectly allowed to do so. You can't set rules for your party and then be disappointed when people would rather not go because of them.", "Oh my god, I would never make someone in that situation have to ASK to have a plus-one.", "No I do. My comment explains why a couple may choose not to extend plus ones.", "I think it\u2019s more being stubborn. Going to a wedding without your new boyfriend doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the level of commitment in the relationship.", "I just LOVE it when people clutch their pearls to their chests about wedding stuff. Get a grip, he won\u2019t be in every single picture will he?!", "Obviously, but OP is setting the precedent that the partners of family members can be excluded depending on one person's perceptions of their aura or energy or vibes or whatever. I think its more that it comes across as rude to not give your sibling, who's in the wedding party a +1. If the sister sees the slight as enough of a reason to decline the invite, she's absolutely permitted to.", "Yea but you think they\u2019ll invite OP if say they do get married? \n\nNAH imho to each their own, just they\u2019ll have to live with their choices.", "I mean, I don\u2019t see it as disrespectful to not want strangers at your wedding.", "I mean, you can be disappointed. You don\u2019t get ragingly pissed and cut family off.", "I didn\u2019t say I would either, I\u2019m just pointing out that\u2019s a different thing.", "Again, its 100% op's call. And it's 100% lil sis's call to attend alone - or not. OP needs to deal if lil sis decides not to come. I would never deny my sister a +1 because they'd only been dating a short while, but it's not my wedding. A few months is plenty long enough to decide you and your sigoth are a package deal.", "A boyfriend of a few months is not a partner either. It\u2019s perfectly appropriate not to invite him on the family beach trip and grandma\u2019s 90th birthday dinner and OP\u2019s wedding. He\u2019s not a member of the family. \n\nOf course the sister doesn\u2019t have to go. Regardless of whether he was invited she could decline. The consequence of declining is further damaging the relationship.", "If the sister skips OP\u2019s wedding, OP might not be inclined to go anyway.", "But isn't it rude/disrespectful to exclude half of a couple from a party invite? I'm not American, so maybe it's different, but I can't imagine throwing an event and making it clear to my brother that their partner is NOT to come unless I was trying to cause issues.", "And I\u2019d never freeze my sibling out for not inviting my new boyfriend to their wedding. \n\nLittle sister is the one making this a relationship ender. That\u2019s her prerogative, but it\u2019s a bit much.", "I don't know, I usually leave it to the people in the relationship to define it. My uncle married my aunt 35 years ago a few months after meeting her, I think he would have been pretty offended if some stranger on the internet declared that their relationship doesn't count because they say so. I don't think it's anyone else's decision whether they're serious about each other or not, especially if she and he have decided they are.\n\n\nThat said, of course OP and her family can exclude him. It's also perfectly reasonable for the sister to decline the invitation, and it doesn't sound like OP is particularly concerned about whether she comes or not, so it's probably for the best.", "> A boyfriend of a few months is not a partner either. \n\nEvery partner/husband started off as a boyfriend of a few months once upon a time.", "Again, it depends on the event and how long they\u2019ve been together for me. My 30th birthday dinner at a restaurant with my family? No, I don\u2019t particularly want the girl my brother has been dating for a month there. A larger 30th birthday party at a bar or event space with 30+ guests? Sure he can bring her.", "That doesn\u2019t mean that every flavor of the week needs to be embraced as a family member from the very beginning.", "Sure, but either way your brother can decline the invite if he wants to."]}
