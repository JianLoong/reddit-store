We co parent fine usually but there has always been this one thing we disagree on.\n\nMy SIL introduced our son to the wonderful world of ballet when he was 5 and he was immediately hooked.\n\nHe was always dancing and loved watching my SIL\u2019s ballet performances. It was absolutely adorable. \n\nMy ex had a big issue with this as he thinks ballet is girly and he was terrified our son was gay (which is dumb because who gives a shit). He would always shut down our son\u2019s dreams and when our son asked if he could get lessons, he made fun of him. \n\nWe had a massive fight over this and eventually he just said to do whatever.\n\nOur son is now 12 and is an excellent dancer. Unfortunately, his father hasn\u2019t shown up to a single performance. No matter what I do, he just refuses to show up. \n\nMy son has a performance coming up and while he usually doesn\u2019t say anything about his dad not coming, we were watching a movie last night that was eerily similar to what my son may be experiencing regarding ballet and his father and he started to get upset. He tried very hard to be tough about it but told me he just wanted his dad to see him dance once. It\u2019s the only thing he wants. \n\nThis morning, while our son was at school, I called my ex. I told him what our son said and begged for him to come. He said no and that the only reason he\u2019s letting our son do ballet is because we agreed that I wouldn\u2019t force him to be involved in the ballet section of his life. First, we never agreed on shit. Second, I asked him if he was really going to be this stubborn and he said \u201cI don\u2019t want to see my son dance like a fucking girl, it\u2019s fucking humiliating\u201d\n\nI was so tired. I told him that if he didn\u2019t come I\u2019d tell his mother (who\u2019s helping him financially) the real reason we split. He immediately got mad and said that I couldn\u2019t do that and that I\u2019m threatening him and blah blah blah. I just told him that I\u2019d better see him there and he\u2019d better behave or else I will tell. \n\nHe just said fine but called me a bitch as well. I feel slightly guilty but relieved mostly. But my best friend thinks I\u2019m bordering on crazy and that I shouldn\u2019t threaten him. I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong honestly but I just don\u2019t know if I care... AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nHe cheated on me with MANY MANY women from coworkers to long time friends to younger women to older women. He also used up a massive amount of his mom\u2019s money that she gave us for our son to make these women happy. There is another thing as well but idk if I feel comfortable sharing. \n\nHis mom thinks we split amicably because we felt we got married too young.", "created_utc": 1670978284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlcb15/aita_for_threatening_my_ex_to_attend_our_sons/", "score": 320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, I would suspect your strategy isn't going to pay dividends and may even backfire on you.

Slight case of being the AH for threatening to expose the reason you split up to force your ex to do something he'll resent, and possibly ruin for your son.\n\nBetter would be to invite the ex-MIL to the performance, and have her gush about how good her grandson is at ballet.\n\nOh.   And don't tell your ex this, but Baryshnikov got plenty of tail.   Perhaps because he was an incredible athlete with a rock hard body, and was pretty well off.", "Wait, why did you break up?

And tell his mom why you really broke up.", "This is tricky. I think for what you did, NTA, because as a father he needs to support his son and to get over his outdated and sexist views. And I understand you wanting to do anything to get him to be that role. Unfortunately, he\u2019ll never be that unless he actively chooses to be so.\n\nHowever, your son wants his dad to see him dance, meaning he wants his dad to be *supportive.* I feel like going behind his back and forcing his dad to attend through threats might give him\u2026false hope? What if he talks to his dad after the performance, only for your ex to reveal that the only reason he came was because you threatened him? That would be shattering and might even make your son lose trust in you.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the right call here is. It might be better to acknowledge your son\u2019s feelings and that what his dad is doing to him is not fair. He has a right to feel hurt and angry. At the end of the day, his dad trapped himself in a macho cave and he\u2019s afraid of \u201csoft\u201d things, which is his problem. And even if he keeps himself trapped there forever, at least your son will always have one fully supportive parent who loves him no matter what.\n\nOf course that wouldn\u2019t erase the hurt of his father never watching him dance.

How awful to experience your own father openly disdaining such an important part of yourself and for ridiculous, hateful reasons.\n\nHowever, emotional blackmail is not a good move in a relationship, including a co-parenting one.

If your son is still developing and his father isn\u2019t involved, as he grows up he will remember this and probably wont show the dad the same love he shows you. The dad needs to BE A MAN which is being a role model to his son, and not be a little b**ch about his son being interested in different things than him. It\u2019s probably going to make the sons year and maybe even the father will see how talented he is, and be proud of him.", "YTA \n\nOnly because this is gonna cause more problems with your son when he finds out he\u2019s only there cause you threatened his dad and he doesn\u2019t want to be there.

NTA, but I think you'd better do whatever's best for your son.", "I get where you're coming from; you only want to see your son happy. However dragging a obviously homophobic and insecure ex into the mix is more likely to cause drama, not happiness.  Ballet, gay or not gay, your ex doesn't deserve to be a part of something that makes your son so happy because I guarantee he will attempt to squash those dreams. He cares more about his own self image and from what you say he is a classic narcissist.  You are great for supporting his interests, and dad can go suck it; his loss.", "Firmly NTA. The blackmail doesn\u2019t seem like the right way to go about it, though I understand. Your son seems to be internalizing this situation with his father not supporting him way more than he appears to - good for you mom. It\u2019s a hard world, and every boy needs a mom like you on his side.", "You are NTA, your ex is the asshole here.  But I don't think you should threaten your ex to get him to come to the ballet performance.  Having him there might make things worse.  I know your son really wants him there, but if the ex shows up and is even more unsupportive (or even cruel), it might be even more hurtful to your son.", "I'm glad you're supporting your son. You're a great mom but in this instance I vote soft yta. Threatening to tell his mom whatever isn't going to improve the situation. It's not going to make him come around. Your ex sounds like a massive, hateful, insecure, mean jerk and even if he's forced to come, he's going to be bitter and resentful, not proud and supportive like he should be. I'm worried he'll say something or act out in a way that really hurts your son (beyond just the lack of attendance). It's too bad for your son, I'm so sorry, but you can't force someone to be a good parent.", ">we were watching a movie last night that was eerily similar to what my son may be experiencing regarding ballet and his father\n\n\"Billy Elliot\"? If so, excellent movie! \n\n~~(Soft) YTA for breaking your agreement with him and blackmailing him into something he isn't willing to do.~~ I misread that bit about the \"agreement\", apologies.\n\nNTA - But I will say, trying to force a man to be involved with his child in the way you want him to be involved will never work and could put your son in a very difficult position.\n\nEx is the obvious AH here for obvious reasons but hopefully he will figure out how to accept his son for who he is not for who Ex wants him to be.", "NTA.  For being a great mom to your son!", "NTA\n\nYour son will realize in his own time that his dad is an unsupportive asshole, and he will 100% resent him for that in the future. Ex doesn't get to pick and choose the traits your son has and it seems as if your son is doing excellent without his support so he should just keep doing what he's doing. Don't pressure ex to come to dances, if he doesn't want to come on his own terms then he isn't worth you or your sons time.", "ESH. Him, for obvious reasons. You, for, well, obvious reasons! As you admitted, blackmailing him, even for good reason (and even if his cheating ass deserves it) is an a-hole move.

If nothing else it will be the last memory.", "Maybe this will be unpopular, but I'm going with NTA. \n\nI do think your ex needs to work out his issues about this. Someone needs to explain to him about how football players often learn ballet. But also, I feel like you shouldn't HAVE TO threaten him, and since your son really wants him to be there, if that's what you have to do to honor your son's wishes, well, so be it. \n\nRegardless, from one mom to another, good job \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Time to start teaching your kid the sad reality that family is more than genetics and his sore may not be a father to him. This guy cheated on you and is mooching off his mom. He is trying to bully his son for enjoying ballet. More than threatening to tell his mom what he did with her grandson's money you should be threatening to sue for full custody. This guy's gonna damage your son's mental health as long as he's in the picture. Take care of you and yours.", "This is a very complex situation for a person to be in. While I absolutely agree that the child's happiness should always come first, you also need to understand the father's view. Society always points out very clearly that we cannot choose what we feel, that we cannot choose not to be gay, not to be bisexual, heterosexual, etc. The same applies here. The father apparently cannot stand \"girly\" boys and it pains him that his son is one of those people. Is he in the wrong? Well, yes, because the kid who didn't do anything wrong, really, is essentially being ignored by his father. Is the father an asshole? I wouldn't say that, he just has a very, very, very hard time processing this. Will you fix this by calling him names, threatening him by telling his mom, etc? Absolutely not. If anything, you'll just make him cut all ties with you and your son and strengthen his hate or disgust or whatever he feels towards \"girly\" boys.\n\nDo not threaten the man. Instead, engage in conversation like grown ups. Speak often in matters that don't concern his ballet, instead focus on his academic success, social life, etc. Perhaps one day he will attend one of his performances. And if he won't, then that's his decision.", "YTA. He doesn't want to be there. When your son sees how \"embarrassed\" he is it will break him. Or when he refuses to ever come watch him dance again. Or when he makes passive aggressive comments about the way he is dressed. So on and so forth.  \n\nLet him make his own bed with his son and he will have to lay in it for the rest of his life. He's never going to see ballet as something his son should participate in, and that's OK. Imagine if your son were into hunting and you were against it, would you go support him as he shoots a deer? Even if you hate it? Your husband is an idiot but he is the one who will have to face the consequences of that. Let it be. It is their relationship, not yours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He is pissed that his son, gay or not, is not and probably will never be like him.", "NTA. But I would seriously consider that this could end up backfiring and getting your sons hopes up and him possibly getting more hurt.", "I'm glad your son will have this, he deserves it.\n\nTbh, you should tell your ex's mother anyway. Why are you protecting this cheating, thieving homophobe?", "I have two son's. One is just a few months the other is 4 and loves to dance. I let him dance and take him to dance classes. His father supports it him dancing as he knows his son loves it. I also teach dance and am a professional dancer. I have worked with many men and will say while yes some men are gay, others are straight and dance never made anyone gay. Honestly the straight guys always got the girls. On a side note Patrick Swayze's mother taught dance and owned a studio. Patrick danced growing up. You can do some quick Google research and find many very well known men who dance and are super manly and dance like men. One other thing one of the teachers I apprenticed under was a straight male teacher. It was super wonderful to learn from both female and male for my training. Keep supporting your son and be there for him. NTA!!!!!", "This guy is a piece of work.", "NTA (sorry, on mobile).\n\nPrince George (second in line for the UK throne) does ballet, he got mocked by a reporter for doing it, and the reporter got totally trashed, look up some of the responses by ballerinas everywhere! Male ballerinas especially. They even mobbed the studio. \n\nCheck Matthew Bournes choreographies, especially the one of \u2018Swan lake\u2019, with all the male ballerinas. \n\nMariinsky Theatre does the most spectacular performances. \n\nSome male dancers that I like to follow on Instagram (list is by no means exhaustive, I\u2019m sure there are many more greats! I just only have so much time to scroll): vladimir shklyyarov, xander parish, jacopo tissi, \u201cwiggle lizard\u201d, manuel vaccaro, paulo gonzalez, diego tapanes. \n\nGood luck!", "*\"he said \u201cI don\u2019t want to see my son dance like a fucking girl, it\u2019s fucking humiliating\u201d\"*\n\nWhat a fucking pathetic excuse of a father.......\n\nYou know what\u2019s \"fucking humiliating\"?\n\n**Cheating on your wife!!!**\n\n**Being an adult and having your mommy pay for your shit!!!**\n\n**Being scared of your mommy and have to beg your ex wife to not expose your sorry ass!!!**\n\nYou know what is NOT \"fucking humiliating\"?\n\n#SUPPORTING YOUR OWN CHILD'S DREAMS/PASSION!!!!!\n\n\nTbh, whether he shows up or not, i would expose him to his mommy anyway, simply because of the fact that he hurt your son this bad.\n\nNTA at all", "ESH, but gently in your case. I don\u2019t exactly blame you for blackmailing your ex, especially since he\u2019s being a terrible parent, but you have to realize that this is only going to breed more animosity towards you, as well as your son and his passion. You need to talk to your son about what\u2019s going on, and the MIL too. Stop covering for your ex\u2019s choices.\n\nHOWEVER. You\u2019re doing the right thing by supporting your kid in his passions. Ballet is so often frowned upon when it comes to boys, even though it\u2019s a ridiculously hard form of dance to undertake, and more parents should encourage their kids to try more \u201cfeminine\u201d hobbies and interests, as well as vice versa. Keep being a wonderful parent!", "ESH. I think it\u2019s obvious for him. \n\nAs for you, you really called his mother? The fact of the matter is that you can\u2019t force him to support his son\u2019s dancing. You aren\u2019t married to him anymore, so he doesn\u2019t have to listen to you. Make sure he knows about all the performances and even tell him that his son really wants him to go. At that point, it\u2019s all on him.", "NTA for wanting to encourage dad to attend your son's performances, but slight YTA/ESH for making threats to do so. I think a far better approach would be to tell him that his refusal to see these performances is not only disappointing your son, but also potentially creating a rift during his very formative years that may never be repaired. As others have also pointed out, you don't want to end in a situation where dad reveals that the only reason he attended was because he was being blackmailed (which he might not, since he'd likely have to reveal why, but would still likely cause further rifts and may also impact your relationship with your son).\n\nDad needs to get his head out of his ar** and realise that, if he wants a relationship with his son, he needs to accept son's interests and be proud of his accomplishments. The whole idea that ballet is \"girly\" or \"gay\" (and, as you say, who the f*** cares) is absolute bollocks. If your son is not seeing dad support his choices now, he's not going to share any of them with him in the future, and son is likely to only want to see dad out of obligation rather than any actual want to do so (source: my parents also split when I was 2, and, though he lived interstate, he did always encourage my interests even if he couldn't be a part of them; we aren't particularly close now, but I imagine I would've given up long ago trying to maintain a relationship with him if he hadn't shown such interest).\n\nAs a side note, I started dancing much later in my life (think ballroom type stuff) and was always so very jealous of the guys that had done ballet from a young age. The amount of control, strength, and poise was/is incredible, and learning your body like that provides so many other benefits that it really sets you up for any other type of body movement (to me it's often seemed to be the equivalent of learning piano to give a springboard to any other musical instrument). I remember one guy in particular I performed with had all the girls fawning over him, and I'm fairly certain he ended up sleeping with a number of girls in the cast (not saying this as a motivation to continue with ballet, just highlighting the stupidity of dad's perspective).", "Is it right to blackmail your ex into doing the right thing? Probably not but mostly because there's going to be \"consequences\" for doing so. You need to be prepared for them. Especially since it's probable that your son is going to be the one who suffers from them. In other words: your ex doesn't want to attend and I'm betting he's going to let your son know his \"opinion\" on the matter.", "I was absolutely picturing that. Super emotional and beautiful.", "Yeah like...I kinda doubt this is going to have a \"Billy Elliot\" style happy acceptance ending.", "FYI it\u2019s your first judgment of y t a that will count unless you space it out like I just did.", "Case in point: Mikhail Baryshnikov who was a ballet dancer from the Soviet Union and managed to be a sex symbol in the US during the Cold War", "Yup, I grew up in the dance world. \n\nThere is something incredibly sexy about a man that can dance and isn't afraid to do so.", "Sometimes, the threat is the \"ah ha!\" moment that some people need.\n  \nLike, what is more shameful, the fact that your kid dances, or the fact that you stole money from your mother to cheat on your wife?\n  \nDepending on what state you live in, you could have ripped him to pieces in court based on that alone. \n  \nInstead taking him over the coals, all you want him to do is go to a dance recital. I hope he realizes what a mistake he is making by refusing to go, or only going under duress.", "Lol, she did call him a co-parent, but I don't disagree. Perhaps OP is not the \"asshole\" in the sense that what she did was morally wrong. I don't see it really helping her son in the end though.", "I mean, he also dated Carrie on sex and the city so yeah, sex symbol achievement unlocked.", "That poor kid, honestly the only thing OP can truly do to help him is to just faithfully be that positive reinforcement he needs at his age. I think OP just did it to do *something* in a situation where you really don't have room to do much at all.", "And Jessica Lange. Btw he is 5\u20195. Male ballet dancers have swagger. Edit to say that it\u2019s not like being a sex symbol is the goal and if the son is gay well, great! But it\u2019s not like the most famous male ballet dancer of all time doesn\u2019t prove \u201cmale ballet dancers are all gay\u201d wrong.", "I'm going with NTA. Also, are you referring to Billy Elliot?", "NTA - Way to go Mama Bear!\n\nYour story reminds me of this anime\n\nhttps://myanimelist.net/anime/48702/Dance_Dance_Danseur\n\n\nI think your son would love it.

I like that idea.", "Mama Bear's gonna Mama Bear. As a mother, I am proud of you as a fellow mother. I'd do that shit in a fucking heartbeat. And repeatedly.", "I'm curious if you were watching Billy Elliot, if not OP you should rent it for your son.  Personally I think you should tell his mom the truth anyway because she deserves to know the kind of person she raised.  Also you clearly don't owe your ex anything.  But before you do that since it will obviously cause drama, talk to your son and ask him if he wants his father to be there because you blackmailed him or if he'd rather have his father not show up at all.  I'm concerned that his father will show up and heckle your son during the performance and/or make his (incorrect and outdated) feelings about your son doing ballet known to your son after the performance.", "I was actually thinking of \"Sing\", the young gorilla's situation is quite similar to OP's son's.", "My brother always responded \"I am in a room full of scantily clad women and I am supposed to put my hands on them.\"\n\nHe thought it was great in high school and college.", "Lol lol. Stereotypes are so ridiculous. My 14 yo nephew is gay, can't dance a lick, and is a better shot with a gun or bow than my Airborne Ranger Dad. Ballet is a GRUELING practice, and the dancers are absolutely top shelf athletes.", "NTA. Someone should tell Daddy that a lot of football players and athletes in other sports take dance to learn dexterity and speed. He should look at male dancers. They are extremely fit and strong. They have to be able to lift their partners over their heads with one hand and toss them about.", "Tell the mother so she can give the money to the grandson directly. You're allowing to defraud her by staying quiet.", "I'm gonna say ESH. But for one reason really. This is a short-term solution imo. And moreover I think your ex might end up being an even bigger AH and abuse your son and put his passions down. He might take out his frustrations on him out of spite as well. \n\nWith all due respect what's the Endgame here? Is your ex gonna support your son and stop being a homophobic ass after watching one performance or even if you were to convince him to watch multiple? Your son is still a child so he's very vulnerable and wouldn't be able to stand up to his dad most likely.\n\n So if you wanna dangle the nuclear option over your ex's head please keep your son's wellbeing in mind.", "I don't disagree with you at all, about anything. But...your ex is selfish and isn't going to put your son's wants/needs above his. It's heart breaking, I know from personal experience.
