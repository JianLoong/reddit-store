We co parent fine usually but there has always been this one thing we disagree on.\n\nMy SIL introduced our son to the wonderful world of ballet when he was 5 and he was immediately hooked.\n\nHe was always dancing and loved watching my SIL\u2019s ballet performances. It was absolutely adorable. \n\nMy ex had a big issue with this as he thinks ballet is girly and he was terrified our son was gay (which is dumb because who gives a shit). He would always shut down our son\u2019s dreams and when our son asked if he could get lessons, he made fun of him. \n\nWe had a massive fight over this and eventually he just said to do whatever.\n\nOur son is now 12 and is an excellent dancer. Unfortunately, his father hasn\u2019t shown up to a single performance. No matter what I do, he just refuses to show up. \n\nMy son has a performance coming up and while he usually doesn\u2019t say anything about his dad not coming, we were watching a movie last night that was eerily similar to what my son may be experiencing regarding ballet and his father and he started to get upset. He tried very hard to be tough about it but told me he just wanted his dad to see him dance once. It\u2019s the only thing he wants. \n\nThis morning, while our son was at school, I called my ex. I told him what our son said and begged for him to come. He said no and that the only reason he\u2019s letting our son do ballet is because we agreed that I wouldn\u2019t force him to be involved in the ballet section of his life. First, we never agreed on shit. Second, I asked him if he was really going to be this stubborn and he said \u201cI don\u2019t want to see my son dance like a fucking girl, it\u2019s fucking humiliating\u201d\n\nI was so tired. I told him that if he didn\u2019t come I\u2019d tell his mother (who\u2019s helping him financially) the real reason we split. He immediately got mad and said that I couldn\u2019t do that and that I\u2019m threatening him and blah blah blah. I just told him that I\u2019d better see him there and he\u2019d better behave or else I will tell. \n\nHe just said fine but called me a bitch as well. I feel slightly guilty but relieved mostly. But my best friend thinks I\u2019m bordering on crazy and that I shouldn\u2019t threaten him. I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong honestly but I just don\u2019t know if I care... AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nHe cheated on me with MANY MANY women from coworkers to long time friends to younger women to older women. He also used up a massive amount of his mom\u2019s money that she gave us for our son to make these women happy. There is another thing as well but idk if I feel comfortable sharing. \n\nHis mom thinks we split amicably because we felt we got married too young.", "created_utc": 1670978284, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlcb15/aita_for_threatening_my_ex_to_attend_our_sons/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's pathetic (for him) that you had to resort to blackmail just for one event. \n\nSide note: have you seen Mac's dance scene from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Slight case of being the AH for threatening to expose the reason you split up to force your ex to do something he'll resent, and possibly ruin for your son.\n\nBetter would be to invite the ex-MIL to the performance, and have her gush about how good her grandson is at ballet.\n\nOh.   And don't tell your ex this, but Baryshnikov got plenty of tail.   Perhaps because he was an incredible athlete with a rock hard body, and was pretty well off.", "Wait, why did you break up?

And tell his mom why you really broke up.", "This is tricky. I think for what you did, NTA, because as a father he needs to support his son and to get over his outdated and sexist views. And I understand you wanting to do anything to get him to be that role. Unfortunately, he\u2019ll never be that unless he actively chooses to be so.\n\nHowever, your son wants his dad to see him dance, meaning he wants his dad to be *supportive.* I feel like going behind his back and forcing his dad to attend through threats might give him\u2026false hope? What if he talks to his dad after the performance, only for your ex to reveal that the only reason he came was because you threatened him? That would be shattering and might even make your son lose trust in you.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the right call here is. It might be better to acknowledge your son\u2019s feelings and that what his dad is doing to him is not fair. He has a right to feel hurt and angry. At the end of the day, his dad trapped himself in a macho cave and he\u2019s afraid of \u201csoft\u201d things, which is his problem. And even if he keeps himself trapped there forever, at least your son will always have one fully supportive parent who loves him no matter what.\n\nOf course that wouldn\u2019t erase the hurt of his father never watching him dance.

I feel so sad for your son and furious at your ex. How awful to experience your own father openly disdaining such an important part of yourself and for ridiculous, hateful reasons.\n\nHowever, emotional blackmail is not a good move in a relationship, including a co-parenting one. Unfortunately, you are probably not ever going to get through to him. Moves like this will probably just lead to emotional retaliation.

You're responsible for your own (and it sounds like you are doing great).", "NTA his father should be supportive and lift him up, that\u2019s what parents are for. If your son is still developing and his father isn\u2019t involved, as he grows up he will remember this and probably wont show the dad the same love he shows you. The dad needs to BE A MAN which is being a role model to his son, and not be a little b**ch about his son being interested in different things than him. It\u2019s probably going to make the sons year and maybe even the father will see how talented he is, and be proud of him.", "YTA \n\nOnly because this is gonna cause more problems with your son when he finds out he\u2019s only there cause you threatened his dad and he doesn\u2019t want to be there.

I\u2019d say stay outta their relationship.", "YTA (gently since your heart is in the right place) for emotional blackmail.  \n\nI completely understand where you are coming from...but I don't see this having the hallmark ending where your ex-husband sees ballet in a new light and comes to embrace your sons passion for dance.

NTA, but I think you'd better do whatever's best for your son.", "I get where you're coming from; you only want to see your son happy. However dragging a obviously homophobic and insecure ex into the mix is more likely to cause drama, not happiness.  Ballet, gay or not gay, your ex doesn't deserve to be a part of something that makes your son so happy because I guarantee he will attempt to squash those dreams. He cares more about his own self image and from what you say he is a classic narcissist.  You are great for supporting his interests, and dad can go suck it; his loss.", "Firmly NTA. The blackmail doesn\u2019t seem like the right way to go about it, though I understand. Your son seems to be internalizing this situation with his father not supporting him way more than he appears to - good for you mom. It\u2019s a hard world, and every boy needs a mom like you on his side.", "You are NTA, your ex is the asshole here.  But I don't think you should threaten your ex to get him to come to the ballet performance.  Having him there might make things worse.  I know your son really wants him there, but if the ex shows up and is even more unsupportive (or even cruel), it might be even more hurtful to your son.", "I'm glad you're supporting your son. You're a great mom but in this instance I vote soft yta. Threatening to tell his mom whatever isn't going to improve the situation. It's not going to make him come around. Your ex sounds like a massive, hateful, insecure, mean jerk and even if he's forced to come, he's going to be bitter and resentful, not proud and supportive like he should be. I'm worried he'll say something or act out in a way that really hurts your son (beyond just the lack of attendance). It's too bad for your son, I'm so sorry, but you can't force someone to be a good parent.", ">we were watching a movie last night that was eerily similar to what my son may be experiencing regarding ballet and his father\n\n\"Billy Elliot\"? If so, excellent movie! \n\n~~(Soft) YTA for breaking your agreement with him and blackmailing him into something he isn't willing to do.~~ I misread that bit about the \"agreement\", apologies.\n\nNTA - But I will say, trying to force a man to be involved with his child in the way you want him to be involved will never work and could put your son in a very difficult position.\n\nEx is the obvious AH here for obvious reasons but hopefully he will figure out how to accept his son for who he is not for who Ex wants him to be.", "NTA.  For being a great mom to your son!", "NTA\n\nYour son will realize in his own time that his dad is an unsupportive asshole, and he will 100% resent him for that in the future. Ex doesn't get to pick and choose the traits your son has and it seems as if your son is doing excellent without his support so he should just keep doing what he's doing. Don't pressure ex to come to dances, if he doesn't want to come on his own terms then he isn't worth you or your sons time.", "ESH. Him, for obvious reasons. You, for, well, obvious reasons! As you admitted, blackmailing him, even for good reason (and even if his cheating ass deserves it) is an a-hole move. And as many others pointed out, this won\u2019t encourage him to view the dancing more positively, it will probably just make things messier. \n\nBut now that\u2019s it\u2019s happened, I hope I am wrong, and the power of your son\u2019s dance moves makes his dad see the light! Good luck!! \n\n(Previously wanted I N F O: What movie?!?)", "NTA - but your ex is a major one.", "So what happens if your child does come out as gay? Will his sperm donor leave his life forever? \n\nI've never understood this.  The love for a child is supposed to be the most pure, the most unconditional and I've never understood how a PARENT can walk away from a child. \n\nNTA...at least he sees one performance. If nothing else it will be the last memory.", "Maybe this will be unpopular, but I'm going with NTA. \n\nI do think your ex needs to work out his issues about this. Someone needs to explain to him about how football players often learn ballet. But also, I feel like you shouldn't HAVE TO threaten him, and since your son really wants him to be there, if that's what you have to do to honor your son's wishes, well, so be it. \n\nRegardless, from one mom to another, good job \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Time to start teaching your kid the sad reality that family is more than genetics and his sore may not be a father to him. This guy cheated on you and is mooching off his mom. He is trying to bully his son for enjoying ballet. More than threatening to tell his mom what he did with her grandson's money you should be threatening to sue for full custody. This guy's gonna damage your son's mental health as long as he's in the picture. Take care of you and yours.", "This is a very complex situation for a person to be in. While I absolutely agree that the child's happiness should always come first, you also need to understand the father's view. Society always points out very clearly that we cannot choose what we feel, that we cannot choose not to be gay, not to be bisexual, heterosexual, etc. The same applies here. The father apparently cannot stand \"girly\" boys and it pains him that his son is one of those people. Is he in the wrong? Well, yes, because the kid who didn't do anything wrong, really, is essentially being ignored by his father. Is the father an asshole? I wouldn't say that, he just has a very, very, very hard time processing this. Will you fix this by calling him names, threatening him by telling his mom, etc? Absolutely not. If anything, you'll just make him cut all ties with you and your son and strengthen his hate or disgust or whatever he feels towards \"girly\" boys.\n\nDo not threaten the man. Instead, engage in conversation like grown ups. Speak often in matters that don't concern his ballet, instead focus on his academic success, social life, etc. Perhaps one day he will attend one of his performances. And if he won't, then that's his decision.", "YTA. He doesn't want to be there. When your son sees how \"embarrassed\" he is it will break him. Or when he refuses to ever come watch him dance again. Or when he makes passive aggressive comments about the way he is dressed. So on and so forth.  \n\nLet him make his own bed with his son and he will have to lay in it for the rest of his life. He's never going to see ballet as something his son should participate in, and that's OK. Imagine if your son were into hunting and you were against it, would you go support him as he shoots a deer? Even if you hate it? Your husband is an idiot but he is the one who will have to face the consequences of that. Let it be. It is their relationship, not yours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
