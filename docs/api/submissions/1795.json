I'm sure if there was a way to stop the lows from occurring our endocrinologist would let us know.  It's a hell of a lot harder to prevent lows  in the middle of the night which is why the continuous are the best.

OP did say that though. I was going by this line: \u201cliterally close to dying\u201d which is why I was concerned. \n\nHe was Type 1. I can\u2019t vouch for their education but he was very well managed, so their use of colloquial terms didn\u2019t seem to detract from their ability to help him manage his highs and lows.

I've always heard type 1 endos advocate hard against using that type of language because it is offensive and furthers stigmas around type 1 diabetes.

I mean if a school nurse can control diabetes then why have an endocrinologist or diabetes clinic.  I bet she would give somebody insulin in a low putting them in a coma.  The lack of knowledge of diabetes is frightening.  As a parent of someone who goes low often I'm afraid of someone giving her insulin.", "That\u2019s not at all what I said. I\u2019m saying, if you\u2019re having severe hypoglycaemia once a month to the point you\u2019re afraid you might die, talk to your doctor. There are many factors at play that may be adjustable to mitigate these occurrences.", "It\u2019s possible that trend has changed (this was some years ago) now that T2 is becoming a more significant problem. He came up in the time that diabetes in young people was assumed to be T1, and also assumed to be manageable, so he didn\u2019t encounter much stigma or pity. \n\nNowadays, with T2 being such a big topic, I can understand that stigma and misinformation and \u201cfake concern\u201d are probably a huge problem for all diabetics, and I apologize for perpetuating that. Absolutely wasn\u2019t my intention.", "\"Your science is faulty because I know a guy\" lol", "And I'm saying, as a type 1 diabetic, you can have great control and still go low now and then. There is a fine line between good sugars and passing out. In UK 7 is good, 5 and below is dangerous, 3 and below you're in trouble. It's a very difficult disease to manage and \"it sounds like you just need help getting better control\" is like telling a person with depression to \"cheer up\".", "Hmmmm, that just might be why they have a monitor on him that reads even when he's sleeping?", "Appreciate the apology. Just to clarify, it's really always been T2 as the more prevalent disease, which is where the stigma comes from. At least in the U.S. It's definitely getting better, but I've been diabetic for almost 20 years and it's still constant \"oh my grandma had diabetes!\" or \"omg you can't eat that!\" It's all good though. People don't understand how difficult it is to manage or even *want* to manage when it's such a crapshoot half the time, and not to mention how contradictory it is to normal function to have everything you put in your mouth be a decision and involve math. It's not something anyone can truly understand, including doctors.", "No, it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s like telling someone with depression who is concerned about their health and safety that they might want to talk to their doctor about it to see if there\u2019s anything they can do.  If you want to say that even that\u2019s inappropriate, I can agree there\u2019s some validity to that.
