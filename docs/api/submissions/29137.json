My partner and I have no issue traveling. We would be willing to travel/drive anywhere within the US. However, she is holding her wedding out of country. My partner and I haven\u2019t ever left the country, primarily due to finances.  \n\nShe has stated, multiple times in text and in social media posts, that she will be giving the guests 1 year to save. Am I wrong for not wanting to go? She says that she\u2019s doing it overall because it\u2019s cheaper for her and her fianc\u00e9. \n\n\n\nTo clarify, her and I have had issues before. While my partner was living with her during college, she was very abusive and demanding of him. She would text him daily \u201cduties\u201d lists as well as text/call him if he didn\u2019t respond to her requests immediately. She claimed that\u2019s how he would \u201cpay rent\u201d\u2026even though he was paying cash every month anyway. When she moved states, I spoke with the landlord of her apartment and he agreed to let me start a lease there. So, on her move out day, and my packing day, my partner was planning on coming to help me at my apartment. That day, she decided to throw a fit, slam my car door, and claim that my boyfriend (her brother) was choosing me over her. This was because he offered to help me pack. \n\nNeed less to say, at this point, I was angry and tired of her. I got pissed. I reacted irrationally and I threw all of her shampoos downstairs from the bathroom.\n\nShe then blew up on me, accused her brother of gaslighting her, threatened to call the cops on us, and attempted to have my landlord pull our lease. She had also attempted to force me to sign a \u201ccontract\u201d she made on Microsoft Word to buy her washer and dryer so she wouldn\u2019t have to move it.\n\nAfter all of this, I distanced myself from her and everything has been calm. Aside from her occasional social media post complaining about me, things have been okay. I\u2019m really worried that as soon as she realizes my partner and I aren\u2019t going/don\u2019t want to go that she will freak out. What do I do? \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this. Please be brutally honest and let me know what you think. (Sorry if the post is long, I\u2019ve been wanting to post about this situation for a while).\n\n\n**edit**\n\nThanks for the input guys! I think I\u2019m going to just send a gift and leave it at that. My partner is going to go if she offers to cover expenses.

We don\u2019t know what their arrangement was so that\u2019s an eh for me, but in the side of the SIL is an AH. The tantrum and shampoo things makes both of you sound like you were acting like you were aged in the single digits that day. The appliances\u2026also eh for me actually. I\u2019ve seen people leave them to family as a gift, leave them to people with the understanding that they can claim them later and also do just what your SIL did: sell them to friends/family, with or without paperwork, the same as they would to a stranger, so that\u2019s an eh to me too.\n\nBut tbh I don\u2019t think all of that matters a ton.
