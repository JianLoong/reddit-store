He\u2019s \u201cworking on the lease\u201d for the last month.", "If only my bank account understood a bad situation.", "I wouldn\u2019t of addressed it like that, I planned to explain 4 rooms and he gets two(bedroom/office/bathroom. While we get two and a shared bathroom does equal to us paying the majority of the rent.\n\nSadly my own place isn\u2019t as feasible. I have two jobs and probably couldn\u2019t afford a studio(about $1800 right now) since I live in California.", "Have you seen his lease/rental agreement?\n\nIs the landlord aware/okay with him subleasing to others? \n\nHow much is he paying in rent and utilities?\n\nI would argue that you should pay no more than 1/3 of total expenses (rent + utilities) if there are three of you living there. Perhaps less if additional bedrooms are being used exclusively by your friend, ie, for an office, or if he has additional perks such as a private bathroom.\n\nI'll add that you should not have moved in without an agreement in place. You are in a bit of a sitch now, aren't you? I would again suggest moving out before signing any agreement. I predict misery and resentment if you stay.", "Red flags everywhere. Not sure where you are, but that would be grounds for eviction on every rental contract I\u2019ve ever had.", "But you can still find a different shared situation, can't you?", "Well, I wouldn't think you would have, but it's always good to put in those disclaimers.  :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs others are suggesting though, you might want to start looking into a different roommate situation.  Someone a little more adult and professional.  \n\n\nEDIT: You obviously can't move right away, but you can start saving up and start looking.", "Is it your friend\u2019s house, or is it a rental?\n\nIt\u2019s fair to tell him that going from having your own bathroom to having to share is worth more than 9%.\n\nNTA", "No but i know his rent is 2300 due to him telling me before I moved in.\n\nI have talked to his landlord so he knows I\u2019m here.\n\nI think the rent should be 1/4th since he has a 4 bedroom and his brother and I now have one each plus a shared bathroom. Utilities are hard due to him being irresponsible and leaving multiple lights in a night. The other night he left 6 on.\n\nI\u2019m very mindful of leaving stuff on, at my last place I spent no more than $100 on gas+electric(water was included but it\u2019s not here. So $150 is probably what i use a month.", "It\u2019s a sublease, in California it\u2019s completely fine and we have the homeowners permission.", "I wouldn\u2019t be able to for a few months due to needing money for a truck to move.", "Ok so in my humble opinion,\n\n1/3 of $2300 = $766 + $150 in utilities comes out to $916, and should be the max you should be expected to pay - close to what you're paying now.\n\n1/4 of $2300 = $575 + $150 in utilities comes out to $725. You could try for this, I don't think it's an unfair ask, but don't be surprised if he doesn't go for it. \n\nRegardless, don't sign anything - You actually don't have to now that you've moved in. Look for a new place and give 30 days notice to move out as soon as humanly possible. The cleanliness situation will not improve.", "Yeah yours (and the brother\u2019s) rent should definitely be somewhere between 1/4th and 1/3rd. Start looking for somewhere new if he doesn\u2019t agree.", "You're getting at least a hundred off your rent... (sorry, not trying to be snarky). I think this current housing situation is going to go from bad to worse, so you probably want to start looking now."]}
