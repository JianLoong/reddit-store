I was also travelling with someone who works for us, Jake. Teddy was already in South Africa, with Lisa and I going later because of school term dates.\n\nWe booked the flights separately. I spoke to Teddy about which flight would work, but that's all the coordination we had.\n\nFor long haul flights I always fly first class. My daughter is a better flyer that way, as there's less people, she has more space, and it abates my travel anxiety. My family know I fly first class for long hauls so I didn't feel the need to bring this up prior to the flight. We carpooled to the airport, but first class has a separate check-in. Lisa was surprised I was flying first class and said surely my daughter is old enough to behave herself in economy. I said it wasn't about behaving, no one likes being boxed into a seat for 11 hours, 5 or 85. Lisa said she didn't like it either, and that it was unbelievable I paid for a seat for staff and a child just because I couldn't handle sitting in economy. I told her whether she finds it believable or not, that is the case. Again, I tried to start going to my check in, but Lisa started saying how now she had to deal with Sam alone for the whole flight which she wasn't prepared for, and that she's stressed enough without having no help the whole time. She was getting close to tears by this point and I was at total loss what to do. I apologised for the confusion but she wasn't satisfied, saying this is no way to treat family. Eventually, she just snapped \"why can't you just stop being so spoilt?' in a shrill tone, which I'll admit, I didn't take well. I just said \"why can't you just stop being so broke? See how dumb that sounds? Worry about your issues, I'll worry about mine\". I took the opportunity to make my exit and check-in.\n\nWhen we met up with Teddy, Lisa was in a horrible mood and wouldn't speak to me. Later, Teddy and I were talking and he said I shouldn't have said what I did, to which I said his wife shouldn't have melted down in the airport over my travel arrangements. I wasn't going to be babysitting Sam even if I had sat in economy, it would have made no difference to her, and she's well aware of how I travel. She's still not speaking to me over a week later. My stepdad said I was in the right and she's melodramatic. My mother says I probably should have just walked away without saying anything. I don't think I'm the AH for making a statement as ridiculous as hers to point out that my lifestyle wasn't any more her business than hers is mine. Teddy wasn't offended, he knows I'm not actually commenting on their financial situation, just her whining. But Lisa is now making things so complicated I'm not sure if she's overreacting or if I took it too far.", "created_utc": 1677607739, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11efg5i/aita_for_telling_my_sil_to_stop_being_broke_when/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd say your reaction was justified, you were swatting down her green-eyed monster attack, lol.\n\nNTA. Hope she learned a lesson.", "NTA.\n\nLisa is the one who verbally attacked you for literally no reason. You simply set a boundary after she threw a completely unnecessary tantrum out of jealousy and chose to stir shit, so what did she expect? \n\nShe should mind her own business and leave you alone with it.", "I missed the part where you asked Lisa to pay for some portion of your trip, because otherwise, it's none of her business what class ticket you bought. \n\nWhen did people become so enraged with the choices other people make? Oh yeah, she was hoping Jake or you would help her with her own child. \n\nNTA", "NTA. There was no arrangement to sit together or for you to help babysit. She was acting entitled.", "NTA.\n\nIs she paying for your ticket? No? Then she needs to STFU.", "NTA. You are separate families, separate households, separate incomes, separate daily lives. You didn\u2019t purchase seats together. She never had any reason to assume you would even be seated near her, even if you were in economy. This is her expectations disappointing her and putting responsibilities on you that she shouldn\u2019t have. She can be upset all she wants for having to sit alone in economy with her own child, but that doesn\u2019t make it your problem in first class with your own child.", "NTA. Why should you have to check in with another grown adult about your travel plans? Sounds like she was planning on sitting back and letting you keep an eye on both kids. She also sounds like a drama queen. I'd be thankful to not be speaking to someone like her. Im tired of people expecting others to skirt around unreasonable people.\n\nEdited for spelling", "NTA- she's jealous and your comment made me chuckle thinking of Paris Hilton's \"stop being poor\" shirt lol", "Nta. Why do people have more than one kid and act surprised they need more attention duh they\u2019re kids. And she\u2019s very entitled and rude. You are far nicer than I would be had someone talked to me like that after being nice like you were.", "NTA- She berated you for choosing to fly the more comfortable option for you and your child. She expected that you would sit in economy and help her watch her child. I think it was so wrong for her to call you spoilt, but calling her broke was a little inconsiderate, but I totally get it and would've probably done something similar.", "NTA. You only have her back the energy she was giving you. And she complained that now she'd have to watch her own child alone??? Like, why did she think you were going to help her with her kid?", "NTA- the entitlement of this woman is insane. I would never expect someone else to not go in first class just because I wasn't. I would never expect someone else to help me take care of my child on a flight. I would never have full blow melt down in the airport like a toddler over this. Lisa needed to be put in her place, you did that perfectly", "Info: when you say \u201cworks for us\u201d - does Jake work for Teddy and/or Lisa as well as you?", "NTA. She tried to guilt trip you and for what?? Insinuating you are going to 1st class because your daughter can\u2019t behave, then cries because someone won\u2019t help her watch her son?

Not an asshole at all, you literally said that to show how shes acting and she reflected on herself and didn\u2019t like it.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nLisa made a scene because she was so clearly jealous of you flying in first.

If so Lisa was probably hoping to foist Sam on him for the flight, and beyond.\n\nNTA.  You are not responsible for her assumptions about how you are going to live your life and spend your money, and you gave as good as you got in the disagreement, which is fair.", "Could you have handled it better? You could have. Yet, why should you be required to take the \"high road\" when someone decides they want to drive through the swamp? You gave her what she was giving you, so her being upset is on her.

Could you have been nicer? Maybe, but Lisa was being very entitled. What did she expect? For you to give up your seats? Maybe send Jake in economy with both kids? She needs to get over her issues, buy better seats if she can afford them or resign herself to economy.", "NTA. She had no authority to speak to you like that and it was clear jealousy. What did she expect was gonna happen when she called you spoiled for buying a better seat with your own money??", "NTA it\u2019s your money to spend how you want that doesn\u2019t make you spoilt.

It\u2019s her problem she and her husband can\u2019t afford a first class ticket for her and her kid. Very funny \ud83d\ude06 what you told her.

It would have been better if you had maintained your demeanor, thank her for sharing, and walked away.  Many would think that combat (what you did) was appropriate because there are consequences for our behavior.   I think that repeating offensive behavior in public brings oneself down to the level of the offender.   The high road always yields a better outcome for yourself.   The differentiating factor was that you were in public.   Combat is always available, but best used in private.  Be happy.  Best wishes.", "NTA.  Wonder if Lisa plans to spoil the trip for everyone by pouting all the way through it.", "NTA - Lisa was definitely jealous and provoked the issue. You did nothing wrong and she should mind her own business", "NTA", "NTA. You actually called it. The issue wasn't that she needed help with her kid. She was just pissed off that you were flying first class and she wasn't.", "ESH. She overreacted, but you sure didn't help things.\n\nThe typical AITA reaction is; if someone is rude/mean to you, you are justified in being rude/mean back to them (the \"But they started it\" defense). I disagree with this.\n\nYour problem was in not discussing yr seating arrangements before the flight. I'm very surprised this didn't happen even if there wasn't the issue of being separate classes. If I'm on a trip with someone and we're booking separately, we've always talked about things like where we're going to sit. Of course you see in retrospect how doing so would've made you realize what a lot of assumptions she had about the flight (eg expecting you to \"babysit,\" etc). \n\nI think your mother is right. You had apologized for the confusion, and of course you weren't obligated to justify why you want to fly in first class. I can understand the temptation to smart mouth back at her after what she said, but it would have been better if you'd done what your mother suggested and just walked away. I daresay Lisa would've still be upset, but you just handed her some further ammunition about your alleged \"rudeness.\"\n\nYou say, \"I'm not sure if she's overrreacting or if I took it too far.\" The answer is yes to both.", "ESH. not your problem that she was in economy since she didn't ask about flying together or getting seats near each other or anything like that. So she should not have been THAT upset you valued your daughters comfort like you do. but also, probably was a bit of an overreaction to tell her to stop being broke, as 99% of people can't afford to fly First class on long haul flights.", "ESH. Maybe her more than you, but your response was so gross. You could still be snarky and sassy and say \"stop being rude\" \"stop being entitled\" \"stop being lazy\" \"stop being a brat\". Saying to stop being broke and making it about her not having the money to pay for first class put you two on the same level in my eyes. It just shows what your true colors are to me. You didn't get defensive, you immediately attacked her financial situation \"jokingly\". Har har.", "ESH - Lisa was totally wrong but your response reeked of smug snobbery.  First class over the Atlantic isn't twice the price but more like ten times the price.  You should apologize and the chances are very high she will apologize too.", "ESH. There was a major breakdown in communication here. If you knew you were traveling with Lisa why did you not bring up that you were sitting separately from her? While I don't think you're obligated to help take care of her son, having you nearby means she can go to the bathroom without him, have an extra pair of hands in case any of the kids need help with something, etc.. I don't think it's unreasonable for her to assume you'd be sitting together so I do think you're the AH for not mentioning this to her and esp. for the way you worded your comeback. I know you were trying to make a point, but you made it in the worst way possible.\n\nThat being said, I get the feeling Lisa would've sulked and complained even if you had told her you'd be flying first class ahead of time. If you can afford it and it makes traveling easier for you then there's no reason why you shouldn't do it. Would it have been nice to try to find a way to also get Lisa first class tickets and/or found a compromise so she could better manage being in economy without you? Sure. Were you obligated to? No. Her having a tantrum in public is shameful and you shouldn't feel bad about not coddling her.", "ESH She was out of line but you are also an AH for bragging about your wealth. No one likes people like that.", "You both suck.", "ESH. If you choose to fly first class, there's nothing wrong with that & she shouldn't have acted like there was. On the flip side, you shouldn't have told her to stop being so broke. You both flipped out on each other, you both were wrong. Wait for the hurt feelings to subside and then reach out and talk about it with cool heads. I didn't speak to my sister for months once because I felt like she owed me an apology so it can take time.

Again, it didn't land, clearly.\n\nRe Jake, it seemed a little crappy to say \"I know you normally only work 6 days a week and have a fair amount of time off during the day/evening but now you have to play butler on a two week holiday with people you don't know in a place you didn't ask to visit...also you'll be flying economy\". It seemed less like a treat and more like basic courtesy.", "I agree with this. Helping with a child isn't just about babysitting, sometimes it could be simple things like holding the child for a few min while the mother gets the diaper/food/bottle/toy/medicine out of the carry on or uses the facilities. With 3 adults, it also means a chance to get some sleep on an 11 hour flight assuming someone even offers to take the kid off your hands for an hour or two, if the kid refuses to sleep. For me, knowing whether I was traveling alone or with someone with a toddler on a long flight would mean the difference between deciding to go or not go.\n\nOP is not TA for making different travel attachments. But she is certainly one for never even mentioning them before the actual boarding. That was inconsiderate and probably a result of OP's privilege (she is traveling in first class and with an assistant to avoid this exact same experience) that she couldn't see how someone with children might count on their companions while making travel plans. But what really makes OP the AH is dismissing Lisa's valid stress response on suddenly realising her trip just got a lot harder and insulting her in bargain.\n\nDefinitely YTA.", "Valid.", "They were being attacked.

You can\u2019t have a butler that you can afford a first class seat for on your holiday, and then expect to entirely avoid people thinking you\u2019re spoilt. Yes it wasn\u2019t very good of her to say so, but it\u2019s a truth from her perspective just the same.\n\nYou could have been more considerate. As I said, this isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world and it\u2019s very mild, and also your SIL isn\u2019t without blame; but if you have the money, the power and the privilege compared to the person you\u2019re dealing with, well - it\u2019s much easier to be graceful in that situation, and you set a bad example of how to handle your position to your daughter by name-calling and shaming her aunt and cousin.\n\nShe actually couldn\u2019t have resolved this situation herself - she couldn\u2019t afford to travel with you, and having made the booking without talking to her it was in your gift to do so but not hers. And whilst that doesn\u2019t place any *obligation* on you to check in with her and to treat her to nice things, it does create a power imbalance between you which she is clearly much more aware of than you are.\n\nAnd by completely refusing to see this through her eyes at all, and arguing against any blame on a forum where you literally don\u2019t have a question unless there might be some improvements you could make, you\u2019re really cementing the view that you have little understanding of how privilege works.\n\nEdit: side note: it\u2019s hilarious that you want to protect Jake from having his time and effort abused by your SIL purely so you can make sure the only person doing that to him is yourself (as you acknowledge when you explain why you think he deserves a fancy seat).", "They didn't book their seats together, so SIL had no reason to believe they'd be sitting anywhere near one another. If she planned on it, but didn't use her words to check in, that didn't make OP TA, and she only snapped after SIL wouldn't let it go. \n\nWould OP have been TA if they were 15 rows away, also in economy, and were in the first boarding party, leaving SIL behind?  No! \n\nIs OP TA now? No!", "The children are 5 and 7.  No diapers and formula were needed on this flight.", "I completely acknowledge I might be the AH for what I said. It clearly didn't come across in the spirit with which it was intended, and it was petty point scoring because I didn't understand why she was acting like that. Perfectly able to accept it was a dick thing to say.\n\nAnd yes, by most people's barometers, I am spoilt. My life is, compared to a lot of other people's, relatively easy. Not sure why Lisa felt the need to point it out in a petulant tone or what she was trying to get across with it, though.\n\nBut the point remains, she didn't have to resolve the situation. There wasn't actually a situation until she invented one.", ">Again, I tried to start going to my check in, but Lisa started saying how now she had to deal with Sam alone for the whole flight which she wasn't prepared for, and that she's stressed enough without having no help the whole time.\n\nSam is her kid and you have your own kid. I see she frequently tries to pawn Sam off on relatives. \n\nIf she wanted to sit with you, why didn't she coordinate with you on making the plans? To me, this reads more like she assumed you would be in economy which I wouldn't assume and that you would nearby each other which again, I definitely would not assume. She also assumed you would have time for Sam. Again, no. You also said you wouldn't because she does this all the time. \n\n>Eventually, she just snapped \"why can't you just stop being so spoilt?'\n\nBut demanding you sit with her isn't spoiled behavior? I think your clap back was fair. She didn't plan and that is her fault. NTA.\n\nDo people not know how big these planes are? Depending on the jet, it could be 350 to 800 people. Even in economy, no where near each other. Airbuses are double deckers.", ">Lisa was surprised I was flying first class and said surely my daughter is old enough to behave herself in economy.  \n>  \n>Lisa started saying how now she had to deal with Sam alone for the whole flight which she wasn't prepared for\n\nNTA. if 5yo is old enough to behave, then her 7yo should be a cakewalk. later, hater.", "I'm glad that your family is supportive of you! NTA", "NTA. She insulted you. You responded. Her child is not your responsibility. I have traveled with friends and family. Some book first, some comfort+ and a lot economy. I almost always book first for my own comfort. I can afford it. Oh well.", "NTA\n\nLisa was mad because she had an expectation of how this flight was going to go (i.e. you were going to take care of both kids) while she did whatever.\n\nBy continuing the argument in the airport and her not letting you walk away is her fault.  She acted like a petulant child and from the sounds of it, still is acting childish.", "NTA stand your ground and don't take any additional sass from your envious SIL", "Wait\u2026\nYour child is old enough to do fine in economy but her LITERAL older kid isn\u2019t and requires assistance?\n\nGTFO\n\nYou are 100% NTA and for what it\u2019s worth; I agree with you 100%.  The first time I did first class was a work trip to Hawaii.  I would have put someone in a body bag on that 14 hour flight if I wasn\u2019t in my little pod.  If a flight takes longer than an hour, I go first class.  I\u2019m not prissy, entitled, but I work hard, fly rarely, so I can reward myself if I want.  You don\u2019t have to justify yourself!", "NTA\n\nSounds like she's mad at the wrong person. Why didn't Teddy book first class?\n\nOr did Lisa not ask for that?", "NTA. And lol. That was savage, witty, and deserved.", "NTA.  Lisa has issues you can\u2019t fix and aren\u2019t responsible for.", "She is just jealous", "NTA\n\nBut.... Your comment: unnecessary and yeah, you owe an apology for it. Don't get me wrong, she's owes you one too, but i really don't think you're ever off the hook for mocking someone's financial situation.", "NTA.", "NTA. Surely, *her* son is old enough to behave *himself* in economy? Why would you have to be there to help her?", "NTA - so \u201csurely\u201d given how your daughter should know how to \u201cbehave\u201d by now, her son, that\u2019s 2 yrs OLDER, should too. So why would she need your help to mind him? Lol. OP it\u2019s not your responsibility to mind her kid. If she needed help she should\u2019ve discussed it beforehand.", "NTA. The entitlement.", "NTA. If she was so concerned she would've asked you what your seat assignment was ahead of time to even confirm you were sitting hear each other.", "INFO\n\n> someone who works for us\n\nCould you go on? \n\nWho is the \"us\" here? Your family? Your company? \n\nWhat is his role? Is this person a **_servant_**?\n\n> Eventually, she just snapped \"why can't you just stop being so spoilt?\n\n\"Spoilt\" seems like an odd word to use for someone splurging on their **own** dime. Where *does* your money come from? What's your career?", "NTA but I think her entire temper tantrum was to somehow force u to upgrade her and her son or switch seats or give Jake's seat to her or her son.", "ESH", "You shouldn\u2019t have made the comment. But if you always fly this way and she knew this. This is on her. Flights like these have assigned seats and if they didn\u2019t there is no guarantee you would sit next to each other.  NTA.", "Exactly. Verbally attacked *including a nasty dig about paying for \u201cstaff.\u201d* Lisa loses all sympathy points she might have accrued for being called too broke to pay for an upgrade when she makes it clear that she feels that someone who is an employee doesn\u2019t deserve to be flown first class.  \n\nI mean she was TA already, but that just really seals it.", "She didn\u2019t even tell her that. She made a stupid statement to illustrate how stupid SIL\u2019s statement was.", "No, she was expecting them to trade tickets, especially for \u201cthe help\u201d. She could have gotten \u201cthe helps\u201d ticket, and then \u201cthe help\u201d could have taken care of her kid in economy while she was in first class. If that didn\u2019t work, well, a grown up should get the good ticket over the child! (/s) It just reeked of entitlement. \n\nTotally NTA.", "unless you had coordinated your seats, how the hell were you even supposed to help her with Sam?", "Of course.", "Exactly. Which is why its obvious this is more about jealousy than anything else, it's not even logical to think OP was gonna be around to help with her kid either way", "I actually had to go back and check the kid's age. I assumed Sam was a toddler, but 7? My kids were handling long haul flights like champions at 2.", "Right, all the logistics of this seem really odd. OP and her SIL were kinda-sorta planning to travel together (hence being on the same flight, with the same schedule-limitations of the school term OP mentioned) but didn't ACTUALLY coordinate beyond that, with SIL making some unreasonable assumptions.", "Nope, just years of experience living with and interacting with my family. We would as a matter of course help each other out if we were on the same flight. My sister wouldn\u2019t need to explicitly ask because I would help her to the extent I was able whether she did or not. Just like she\u2019d help me.", "Would you assume that your seats, booked separately, would just automatically be close enough together for that to be in any way reasonable? \n\nBecause SIL did nothing to ensure they'd be in any kind of proximity, but seemed to be relying on them being in close proximity.\n\nAnyway, assuming makes an ass out of you.", "How do you paragons of virtue coordinate, if you don't coordinate?", "That commenter is complaining about power imbalances for someone that isn't your responsibility while saying you humiliated your SIL because you bought your employee a 1st class ticket. Someone who is your responsibility. I'm cracking up.", "As I said, you\u2019re not the AH  for not doing anything about the seats - your asshole behaviour was about shaming her financial status in front of your kid and hers in a classless move, and it\u2019s doubled up because you did so because she was having a reaction to three things you yourself struggle with and in fact brought an employee to help you with: travelling without her husband, travelling on a long distance flight, and managing your child alone in a foreign country. Your lack of compassion, not your lack of action, is the part that makes you one of assholes here", "Not a dude\u2026"]}
