I was sad that we haven\u2019t done anything Halloween related so far and he suggested that we do something on Friday (which was a very important work day for him). I agreed and then he suggested taking the day off or leaving work early which I didn\u2019t want him to do. I specifically remember telling him not to take the day off or leave early from work.

My understanding of his schedule is that he\u2019s usually done around 5-6 PM so I assumed that it would be the same. We didn\u2019t have an exact time to meet on Friday, it was contingent on when he would be finished.\n\nThe next morning, I texted him that I would stay home all day and to study and do homework. He misinterpreted that as me wanting to not go out and that I\u2019d stay home. But I was waiting all day for him to call or text me back when he\u2019s finished with work. I even left the house later on so I could study at a cafe closer to his place to avoid traffic.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to call him out of fear of interrupting his meetings/presentations. He calls me around 4 PM wondering where I am as I\u2019m finishing up homework at the cafe. I told him that I was really close by and I could come over right now but he told me to go home. He\u2019s mad at me that he left work early and delegated everything to his team for nothing. And then he said that \u201cI forgot about our plans today\u201d but I\u2019m not sure how I would just forget something like this\u2026 He said he had things to do for us all day starting in the early afternoon. But I had no idea that he actually left work early that afternoon because I told him not to and he didn't text/tell me that at all or gave me an estimate for when he's done.\n\nI want to think that we\u2019re both at fault here because of miscommunication? Maybe I should\u2019ve called or texted him to check-in again that afternoon. But at the same time, he could\u2019ve done the same once he saw my text message to clarify things instead of being mad at me for \u201cstaying home\u201d because I was actually waiting all day for him. Anyways, feeling a bit sad. I still would've loved to do something with him in the evening (it was only 4 PM when he called me) despite the communication mishap but he told me to go home instead.
