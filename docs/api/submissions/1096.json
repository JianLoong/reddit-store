During our conversation we spoke about some fitness topics, they had a quick look at my figure and gave me some feedback and then showed 2 exercises to me. It was all super casual, then they went on to tell me about their business and then spoke about his ex gf etc. but by the 1.5 hour mark I was so drained by the conversation I tried to nudge him but they just kept speaking. 2.5hrs later he finally makes a move and then proceeds to tell me that he will send me his bank details for todays consultation of $90.\n\nI felt sick, as that was a lot of money to ask for when it wasn\u2019t communicated prior, and when it was (to my understanding) a \u201ccatch up\u201d.

I'd charge him the same amount for having to listen to him go on and on for 2.5 hours about his business plan and ex-gf!", "NTA. This sounds like something hookers do in movies.", "Nta. No way. Sounds intentionally vague and scummy to then slap you with a fee. I'd counter and write up a quick contract for future sessions based on a set price per session. \"I agree to pay blah x amount per session/consultation provided blah blah blah. \" \n\nI would suggest to not be like i used to be and think \"oh maybe I just missed him telling me I'd have to pay or maybe I didn't understand our relationship.\" Nah, don't let yourself get screwed just because you're a nice person. You can still be kind but firm. Good luck!", "Not a fucking dime. A real PT session is going to be about you. Your history, goals and how to reach them not to mention some actual exercises, techniques what to eat etc... If you're going to do a consultation you should also be informed ahead of time the costs and what you'll be going over.", "NTA\nDon't pay anything! It's their whole business plan.... \nKeep your money and stop talking to him :)", "NTA and don't pay him. You have to agree to something before it becomes a contract. This is a bait and switch. You don't pay for a consultation that is essentially 1% minor consultation and 99% him chatting and socializing. Frankly, he sounds like a crap trainer, and everything about this screams red flags to me. I'd tell him no, thank you, you appreciated his time and effort, but you hadn't asked for a consultation and you hadn't agreed to a price, so you're not comfortable paying for it.\n\nHe's trying to extort you through social etiquette and expectations. Don't let him. And maybe consider not talking to him. He sounds... very sketchy.", " NTA\n\nDid you ordered a consultation at this day?\n\nJust tell them you will pay, but you have to ask for 90$ for your listening to there problems.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t informed of this cost beforehand. Don\u2019t pay them a dime.", "NTA if you had known it was costing you $90 you might have talked more and asked questions and gotten more actual advice during the consultation.", "NTA Friend might make more money with 'consultations' than with actual clients!", "NTA - Don\u2019t pay this grifter. I wouldn\u2019t worry about losing a friend, this dude ain\u2019t your friend. Consultation fees should be disclosed up front, not after the consultation. It should also be super clear that you\u2019re even having a consultation.", "Tell him he should\u2019ve been like a doctors office and collected the copay before rendering services. Instead he was intentionally secretive.", "NTA. That\u2019s not how you do business, lol. If he wanted to charge you, he should have been clear from the start. \u201cHey, I usually don\u2019t do personal training without a consultation. If you are okay with that, consultation costs 90$ for x time. Let me know if you are interested.\u201d  \n\nHe is a major AH for doing that.", "Not the asshole. Tell them you asked to see them as friends and you don\u2019t pay your friends to chat and 2 or 3 pieces of advice. He wasn\u2019t clear upfront and you were not even working out in a gym, so you won\u2019t be pay $90, and that he owes you $8 for the tea haha \ud83d\ude02\nAnd if he insists too much. Block him. You don\u2019t live nearby you\u2019re fine.", "You are NTA! Don't pay a dime. This is unsolicited BS, and there is no written contract nor other obligation holding you to this con's scam. Walk away and don't look back! And don't feel guilt or communicate with this creep. This is a SCAMMER!", "NTA. Pretty sketchy, him giving you no idea what he normally charges and not making it clear that's what he considered your meeting. You might be able to reason with him on this basis, end up paying much less or preferably nothing. But one thing should be abundantly clear and useful going forward. You said you got to be friends with this guy, but it's pretty obvious that he is by no means a friend. I'll bet people who have known him for a long time keep a wary distance from him.", "NTA. That wasn't a consultation. I should know, I'm a PT, and that's not how I do an initial consultation. And, my initial consultation is free, and is used to gather information, which is me asking a few questions and them filling in blanks,  and set goals etc, not whine about my ex.", "NTA. But are you sure that he really is a personal trainer because the avoidance of going to the gym and just giving you a couple of examples sounds ify to me. Sounds like a scam to me.", "NTA Op the guy is trying to swindle money out of you. \nYou said he works for a personal training company right? Why would he give you *his* bank info? \n\nLets review:\n\n1. He never disclosed this was a consultation\n\n2. He showed up at your place during his own private time rather then making a appointment at his place of employment which is most definitely against police. \n\n3. He asks you you for 90 bucks which is a outrageous fee for a consultation.\n\n4. He doesn't stick to a script but instead just keeps babling on. \n\n5. He doesn't give you any sort of info regarding trainings plans and what aspects you would like to work on. He doesn't ask you personalited questions to get a picture about your requirements. \n\n6. He gives you his *personal* bank information rather then a official bill.\n\n\nOP, you are being played by a person you barely know who assumed he can take advantage of you. \nDon't give him a dime and tell him to fuck off.", "NTA. You sure hes a personal trainer? He sounds very unprofessional and overly friendly (telling you about his past relationship first time you meet). Did he discuss your goals in exercising if it was to lose weight or tone up? Did he advise how to change your diet? Talk about the gym he works at? Packages he can offer? If he just spent the whole time chatting randomly then no dont pay him. Ive never heard of a PT doing a session in a hotel and Ive had a few sessions... Always at. The. Gym.", "ESH - you hadn\u2019t met the guy and knew he was a personal trainer and had asked for a PT session so it was likely he was going to see the meet up in a professional capacity. \n\nHowever I would strongly agree with you that you shouldn\u2019t be paying for time that he was socialising, and the fact he asked to crash at yours and talk about his ex I think you should point out as being evidence that he saw the meet up at least partly in social terms rather than business. \n\nI would suggest you say that it was not made clear to you beforehand that this would be a billable meeting, that a pricing structure was not agreed beforehand, and that the majority of the meeting was of a social nature as evidenced by X, but as a goodwill gesture you would be amenable to covering his travel costs for visiting you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're the one paying to stay in a hotel and somehow he feels that he should charge you for the pleasure of his company? Is he a gigolo?  If he's charging for 'trainer consultation', then he needs to actually train and consult in training. Not drive to someone's house/hotel, then hold out their hand and demand travel fees. I'm quite sure that you would have met him at a gym to talk about gym stuff if you wanted to. 'Let's hang out' is not a green light to charge you anything. 'Hey, let's hang out and while we're at it, how about you arrange or help me out with a consultation' might give him some leeway.

Shove that down his throat with the cold hard truth of cash and payment is not something you imply or infer.", "charge him 90 dollars to sleep on your couch", "Granted, I'm not American, and the way I run my business is individual to me, but I use that first consultation to gather information on their health, any injuries that may prevent certain movements, basically get a baseline of where they're at and work out their goals, it's more of a trust building exercise for us both, they need to feel confident in me, and I need to trust they're giving me all the information I need to keep them safe.", "I wouldn\u2019t, however I would use it in my response that you bought him a gift of a book precisely because he hadn\u2019t mentioned charging you, and you wanted to show appreciation for his visit.

I'd shoot back with ok well deduct it from my $100/hr therapist charges.", "This sounds like a scam. He\u2019s basically talked at you for 2,5hrs and I think expects you to be shellshocked enough to not even question paying. The fact that he also tried to stay on the couch is just bullshit.

Tell him if he keeps harassing you, you will press charges, then block him. Dude\u2019s a con artist, plain and simple. Doubt he is even associated with a gym at all. Scamming people IS his occupation. And him wanting to sleep on your couch means he is either homeless and couch surfing, or wanted to have sex with you.", "Has it occurred to you that he's not actually a personal trainer, and that's why you got ghosted at the gym? The \"trainer\" schtick is his way of chatting up women, he was hoping to \"get\" with you (the asking to stay overnight on your couch is a common play by guys who are hoping for sex), and when he realized that wasn't going to happen, he decided to charge you for a \"consultation\"?\n\nDo not give this loser a dime, drop  him and block him everywhere."]}
