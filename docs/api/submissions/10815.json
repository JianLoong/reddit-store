Now the school I'm in as well as my course has me in smart casual wear except for casual Fridays. I'm not close to her Partner's Kids but we get along fine. The issue comes from her partners son 'Z' , a few years ago my late Gran and had a special long coat made as a college gift, my name is sewn into the sleeve so it can't be switched with a similar kind, this jacket went missing at her daughter's birthday and I was devastated. \n\nNow Z had posted pics of him in it and I called my sister and asked her about it, she explained that Z said I gave it to him, I asked her if she believed that and drove to her for it, Z apparently had a fit before I arrived and left. the coat reaked of Weed and Cigarettes (I don't smoke) so I was mildly upset that she knew where my coat was and believed I had given it away.\n\nFast Forward I've let go of the event for her peace and I'm civil with Z. Her Son 'R' is wearing my Long coat for the Ceremony, He Begged to borrow it and I Trust Him since he understands the sentiment of the coat and promised to hand it back to me once the ceremony is over, I'm wearing one of my work Blazers before someone asks why I'm not wearing it. \n\nNow here's where I could be TA, Z was not part of the ceremony as his mother didn't want him to be part of it, now he's decided to attend and has no clothes to fit in, R called me saying sis took the coat and told Z to wear it. I drove there immediately and confronted her, she confirmed what R told me and I reminded her of what happened before and she assured me it wouldn't happen again, I told her I wasn't comfortable with Z wearing the coat and after some back and forth I took it back.\n\nI got home and Sister had already told our parents what happened, mom understands but is guilt tripping me as it's sisters day, Dad's on my side and trying to keep the peace but now sister wants Z to wear my coat because it would complete his 'Outfit' and calling me a Petty A for holding a grudge, I fired back that if I'm so petty against a thief I wont attend her wedding, this shut her up and ended her rant.\n\nBIL called me a few hours later and had no idea that sister was fighting for the coat as when the coat first went missing he apologized on Z behalf. He reminded me that it's still my sister and that he'd things out and would like me to attend the wedding.\n\nI'm not good after all the back and forth between her and I and honestly I don't feel like attending the Wedding after all the horrible things she said and called me.So WIBTA?", "created_utc": 1677256020, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11aveaw/wibta_for_skipping_a_wedding_for_a_coat/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s your coat. It literally has your name on it, why is anyone but you wearing it all at? \n\nFuck that. NTA. I\u2019d go the wedding but I wouldn\u2019t be taking that coat.", "NTA.

Yikes! Z is clearly the favorite son in that house. If he wears it, he'll ruin it just to spite you - rip it in an obvious spot or something.\n\nIMO, you should clue your BIL in on how awful your sister is, tell R he's always got a safe place with you if he needs to escape his toxic household, & go low/no contact with your sister.", "NTA.

Go LC.", "NTA\n\nRemind your BIL that the reason (I assume) you haven't called the police for theft or filed against them in court for reparations for professional cleaning and mending is because she is your sister. But the grace of that status has now been exhausted, your sister needs to replenish it with genuine apologies to you, humbly calling off the relatives she's incited to berate you, and being the \"bad-guy\" doling out and enforcing appropriate punishment to lying and thieving Z.", "NTA - but not attending that wedding will likely haunt you.  For years. So consider it thoroughly.  \n\nDon't wear that coat to their home or this wedding - and make sure it's locked up if they're in your home.  I don't know what it's made of - but they obviously want to get their hands on it permanently and you plan to keep it.  Perhaps it's valuable - perhaps it just looks that good on Z - but geez - that's a nutty obsession to steal another person's coat!  \nThey're lucky there wasn't police involvement which would have been justified.   \n\nAnyway - adults aren't behaving like adults here. The bad behavior of posing as the borrower to get the coat for the OG thief isn't a good look....  \n\nBut it's probably worth swallowing all the anger and getting thru the wedding so that you can say you went.   (Sounds like it's gonna be a true three-ring circus of a family unless the new parent has some moxy and can parent better).    \n\nIt's never bad to be the more grown-up person at a family event.  As long as you have the option to leave? (Your own transportation out of there?) You're good.  Though frankly, I'd be trepidatious too.", "NTA. if you see Z in the coat again, call the non emergency police and report a theft.", "If it were me, I\u2019d go to the wedding, but I\u2019d go for R and BIL and the parents, the decent people in this mess.  I\u2019d go to support them.  Not going to the wedding will cause more drama.
