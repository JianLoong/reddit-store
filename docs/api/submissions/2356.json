That teacher needs to be fired!  Please have a parent or another adult (unless you are an adult!) talk to the administration about this.  That was extremely inappropriate and abusive behavior by the teacher.  No wonder your sister doesn't want to return.", "NTA, the ADA does not take kindly to stunts like this. Not just the teacher, but the school could get in trouble for this, have your parent report this and also take to social media to put this on blast. That'll get some attention; teacher wants to play ball there, play hardball.", "NTA. And he should be reported straight up if that's what he said to her. That is totally unprofessional.", "Your parent needs to contact the school right away. This teacher needs to be addressed. If your sister has accommodations (IEP or a 504) in a public school, it is illegal for him to do this. Not only that, his complete lack of professionalism and kindness as well as his bullying behavior need to be addressed. \n\nEta: NTA", "NTA\n\nGo to the school. He needs to be fired and barred from teaching.", "NTA but that teacher should be removed from the classroom!\n\nIf you're in the US, that teacher should be reported to administration and the school board.  If your child qualifies for testing accommodations it isn't only for a \"test\" it is for ANY assessment that is given - written, oral, smoke signals, whatever.\n\nAn adult should give a talking to to the teacher and talk with the principal and any other person in charge.  Your sister was humiliated in front of the class and that is not acceptable.", "NTA, as a parent I would go full tilt and file a lawsuit and scare the shit out of the school and school board, that teacher should never be left alone with vulnerable children again.", "NTA and neither is she. You should reach to the school direction asap.", "Your parents need to contact the 504/IEP coordinator, counselor, and administrator NOW. NTA.", "How rude of the teacher! If you can have the parent, or custodial parent/person contact the teacher. A kid shouldn\u2019t have to fight for their rights like this but a grownup sure can and should. Good luck!", "NTA \n\nThe teacher IS however. \n\n>My sister (13F) is supposed to receive testing accommodations on all tests in her middle school because of her learning disorder.\n\nI suppose this was recommended by a doctor/ therapist ? Do tell your parents what happened. The teacher was acting way out of line.", "Um NTA and please tell your parents and the school principal. That teacher is violating established protocols that he is REQUIRED to follow period. Your sister is being abused. Do something!", "NTA. Assuming she's at a public institution, that teacher is breaking the law, how he responded was incredibly out of line, and she shouldn't have had to have that conversation in the first place.\n\nHowever, I would next time counsel your sister to include someone else in on the conversation, and have them make the request for accommodations from the teacher. Kids should be included on the conversation surrounding academic accommodations, but they shouldn't be the ones to have to fight for them.\n\nUnfortunately some (a lot) of teachers tend to respond that way, and they need to hear from another authority figure what their responsibilities are. As someone who deals in academic accommodations at the postsecondary level, it's a lot easier to get results when someone in a position of power (such as an IEP/504 coordinator or a parent/guardian) connects with the instructor and lays out expectations.", "NTA-- and you really need your parents to file a report. That is serious discrimination and grounds for him to be fired.  If you don't want to do it for her, do it for all of the other kids in his class that he will abuse. If my parents wouldn't do it, I would contact the school myself. If they don't do anything, I'd contact the school board.", "NTA. That teacher needs to be reported! That\u2019s horrific. I can understand why she doesn\u2019t want to go back, because this is so wrong and she shouldn\u2019t ever have to be in class with that teacher again (nor should any other student).", "Is this n the U. S.?  If so, what her teacher is doing is illegal. Teachers are required to follow a student's IEP/504 plan.  I suggest your family meet with the principal asap!", "NTA \nWTF?!?! As a special education teacher I am appalled by this jerk face!!!! Yes she should absolutely receive her accommodations. Does she have an IEP or 504 (assuming US). She needs to talk to her case manager ASAP!! And this teacher needs to be reported!! Not following an IEP/504 can get a school in HUGE trouble", "This makes me really enraged. That teacher absolutely knows he's 1) not allowed to give tests without accommodations in place and 2) cannot vilify a student who requests their accommodations be met. That's against the law. The administration must be told immediately. If he's doing that to one student he's doing it to many others. He needs to be removed.", "Y'all need to report this to the principal, this is horrific behavior & the teacher should be fired.", "INFO - what country are you in? Because what that teacher did would be illegal in the USA\n\nBut also, why are you giving this advice and dealing with the aftermath instead of your parents?", "OK at 1st I was like, well, our school only accommodates tests if they count for a grade (pretests do not count, nor do test like questions that are not graded summative.), then I heard his reaction.  If she has an IEP or 504 then she has a specialized teacher that she can email (I assume she has email) that will fight for her to get her accommodations.  Her parents should also email the principal and superintendent of the school about how they are breaking FEDERAL LAW.", "Info: do you take care of your sisters IEP or do parents, guardians, or other family members?", "NTA at all!! The teacher is clearly TA here. I\u2019m not a teacher but I feel like the very core of what a teacher is supposed to do is to figure what what is the best way to teach their students. It\u2019s not a one size fits all and it\u2019s a shame the teacher couldn\u2019t care any less. And to ridicule her in front of her classmates?", "NTA\n\nYou were looking out for her.\n\nAssuming you are in the US, then your sister has an IEP, which spells out her accommodations.  \n\nWhat her teacher did broke all kinds of laws, and tramatized your sister.  The teacher was completely out of line. \n\nYour parents need to complain to the special education process coordinator, the director of special education, and the principal.  There was absolutely no excuse for the behavior of that teacher.  He needs to be put on leave and possibly lose his job over this.  \n\nQuizzes are assessments.  Your sister is supposed to receive additional time for assessments.", "NTA - Release the lawyers. Lots of legal violations here. The teacher, school and school district are all set for a reckoning.", "YTA. An ADULT should have been advocating for her.\n\nAnd an adult should be reporting that asshole teacher for his nasty behavior and bullying language to a student as well.", "Info: gonna take a shot in the dark and guess it's adhd?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm a teacher and that is extremely bad behavior from the teacher.  \nThat teacher should obviously be fired. A teacher should never belittle the difficulties of their students, especially not in front of the class.  \nAnd reasons like this are why teachers need to be treated / paid better. There are teacher shortages in many different countries, they are more or less hiring anyone, including people in this situation, that have no business being a teacher.", "Depending on the accommodation type, the teacher can be held personally responsible for not following the plan if there's documentation in place. No union can help if public school teachers don't follow education plans.", "Or any children. He has no business being in a classroom.", "I agree with this. She should have a special ed teacher that works with her and is in charge of making sure her IEP accommodations are met. This should be her / your parent's first point of contact. \n\nIt is good that your sister advocates for herself, but she should also know that she can always go to her special ed teacher for support and to let them know what is going on if she doesn't feel comfortable talking directly to the classroom teacher.", "Did I miss something? What comment did OP make that was ableist? She just suggested her sister tell the teachers that she requires the accommodations.", "I have an autistic son. If he asks for accomodations and doesn't get them, telling him to do it over again for the same results is ineffective.\nPart if the accomodations needed are a good advocate at home.\nAlerting parents is the way to go, not telling sibling to ask again.\nAnd ah is a pretty strong word for a young human in this situation, so I'm going to retract that part.", "I get where you are coming from, I'm a mom of 4 kids, 2 of whom are also on the spectrum, as well as being on the spectrum myself. I don't think she told her sibling to talk to the teacher again, just the once.\n\nI can say that IMO she is NTA and I hope OPs parents go fully bear on that teacher. I remember a teacher doing something similar to me when I was a kid and I had a lot of trauma from it that took me a long time to recover from."]}
