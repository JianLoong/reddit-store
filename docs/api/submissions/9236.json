I understand that the things she's said have hurt you. At the same time, making her reaction to her trauma all about you, and then insulting her over it, did not give you the results you wanted -- obviously. If you want to maintain this friendship, the way to do it is by trying to empathize with where she's coming from, not by keeping score about who needs to apologize for what.\n\nIn addition, let me just say that in my experience, most women who say \"fuck all men\" or \"men are trash\" don't really mean it. They are attempting to cancel out the social conditioning they've received to constantly sympathize with and forgive men by going all the way in the opposite direction. This social conditioning is one of the reasons your friend kept getting into abusive relationships, after all. It's not about **you** at all. This does not mean she's done nothing wrong, but she's not the one I'm talking to right now. You owe it to friends to do your best to understand them.", ">talking about how every person with a penis sucks. and ive talked to her about it. and about if she hates me for being a man. and she back tracked and said \"not all men. just the ones in my life\".\n\nso what, you too? or are you not in her life.", "NTA. Time to end this friendship as she has made it clear she doesn't want men in her life. Why pursue a relationship where you are ignored at best and abused at worst. Her issues are hers to deal with. You don't need to be her punching bag.", "ESH\n\nHer stated views are horrible, even if it is a reaction to trauma. It is perfectly fine for you to express that you have an issue with what she is saying, and to tell her how you feel. You can cut her off as a friend or limit contact. There are multiple appropriate ways that you can call out her actions and set boundaries.\n\n>i finally had enough and said that if she hated men so much, why she kept dating shitty ones.\n\nThis was not a helpful comment. You were targeting an area where she was vulnerable as a way of venting your frustration. You weren't helping her listen better, or even critiquing her problematic behavior. If you are not able to continue the conversation you can leave, but your frustration does not justify personal attacks on an unrelated issue. Blaming someone for past shitty relationships isn't a cool move.", "NTA. Her extreme views and history suggest she should be in therapy for the traumas before going into relationships because that is clearly impacting her. She's dating the same people, I'm guessing, because she doesn't stop to look at why they were not suitable for her, what went wrong, etc. It doesn't mean that she should just date women because she's just avoiding dealing with the problem, which might move over to \"all women suck\" if she carries the problem over. You have a right to feel offended at her viewpoint because you're in her life and she said \"all men in her life suck\", which includes you. She's being aggressive and there are consequences to it.", "Stuff like that is difficult. My ex gf, about 3 years into our relationship, occasionally started saying stuff like that. I never knew what to reply to that. At first I mostly agreed. Then I started making jokes about how much men suck, because I'm the type of person who makes dumb ass jokes when feeling nervous. But after a while it just got annoying - always getting shit from a person who's dear to you for something you didn't do and have no control over. \n\nIt ultimately had nothing to do with why we broke up, but it sure got hard dealing with that constantly and I could imagine this would've become a major problems a few more years down the line.\n\nI'll go with ESH, because blaming people for the partners they chose is dumb as well.", "It sounds like she was venting, and she apologized to you when you told her to stop...so how exactly did she blow up? Maybe she needs some space, or she's getting emotional support from someone else now. How long has it been since you've talked?", "Ok, so basically I'm like your friend. I've had horrific trauma, physically, sexual and emotional from men, since I was a 9 month old baby. Literally, the first time my father assualted me was written in my baby book. I hate all men. I think men are inherently violent and dangerous. I work on this in therapy diligently as I am raising a son and I desperately want to be able to help him become a good man and I don't want to ever hurt him with my trauma. They do exist. Man haters, we know that it's not 100% of men. But it is like 99% of men to varying degrees. The flipside of my trauma is that because of it all, I was in the habit of seeking male approval and company to replace what I had never had. So most of my friends are men. Also, the availability of men makes it easier to maintain friendships as they aren't usually bothered to stay around their home caring for it and their children where my female friends are stuck doing that and it makes it harder to maintain those friendships as I am also stuck in home caring for it and looking after my children.\n\nI had one friend who like you was offended by my man hating. I said to him \"if you want to count yourself as one of the men I'm talking about, that's on you. I've always been very clear to you that you are one of the most wonderful human beings I've ever met and I love you to pieces\". It wasn't about him. It isn't about you. It's about expressing the rage and primal pain we've experienced at the hands of men. Don't make it about yourself, if she saw you as one of them she wouldn't have a friendship with you. Just support your friend. Another friend of mine takes on that point of view. Whenever I've had another bad experience with a man and I say something like \"I fucking hate them. They suck. All men are awful.\" He just says \"I know, men fucking suck\" because he is aware and confident that he is a good man and I am not lumping him in with the dirt bags who hurt me. He is also aware and supportive of how much evidence I've had in my life that men do in fact suck and that I am allowed to feel that way after all the rapes and beatings etc I've experienced. \n\nBlack and white/absolute thinking and speech patterns are a literal symptom of PTSD which is sounds like your friend has.", "ESH for saying \u201cwhy do you keep dating shitty ones\u201d because that\u2019s victim blaming.\n\nI get that you\u2019re upset after hearing her rage on about men, I get it hurts your feelings. \n\nThe question is, what do you want and what are you willing to do? Do you want to salvage this friendship, and are you willing to accept that she will say generalised and hurtful things about men in the future? \nBecause if you want to continue this friendship you could apologise to her for what you said and initiate a calm conversation that while you understand that she was hurt and traumatised badly, but it hurts you and it hurts your friendship if she continues to say things like that about all men.", "NTA-you shouldn't be a doormat for anyone. It's sad what she went through but those are her issues to deal with.", "NTA, it's one of those things where unfortunately she's had a lot of bad experiences so it's informed her opinion but she needs to realize with time that it's not healthy to stay that bitter and if she wants to focus on women and stay away from men that's fine but it doesn't make you her friend feel comfortable", "YTA a little bit.

Just because someone has been through something doesn't excuse her being toxic towards you. If you need to break up this friendship because she is making sexist comments, that is completely OK.\n\nIf this were a man saying terrible things about women, the fact that he had an abusive mother and been used and abused in relationships with women wouldn't matter, people would still be calling him a misogynist. It's the exact same thing here. I think people commenting should stop and think \"what would I say if the genders were reversed\".", "NTA.
