They are attempting to cancel out the social conditioning they've received to constantly sympathize with and forgive men by going all the way in the opposite direction. This social conditioning is one of the reasons your friend kept getting into abusive relationships, after all. It's not about **you** at all.

Male rape victims and male victims of domestic violence are also liars until proven otherwise and then they're just considered pathetic. \n\nMen have a massively high suicide rate in comparison to women.

Never even heard on the news about little girls, tiny babies even being stolen and molested or raped by men? Never were told it's not safe to be out alone at night? \n\nMy point is that those stories and warnings, what we hear as young women growing up, they do shape a sense of caution in us. And that is quickly turned to fear when you do experience an atrocity. We are absolute taught to fear men. And those teachings often come from our fathers and brothers too, not just our mothers. We get these warnings because it is true, men are dangerous and women are in perile. We have to stay vigilant, we have to carry out keys laced between our fingers, we have to park under street lights and close to the shop entrance, we have to watch our drinks and wear nail polish that changes colour if our drinks are drugged. Because it happens. Every day. All over the world.\n\nI agree generalisations aren't healthy but they also aren't coming from healthy people.
