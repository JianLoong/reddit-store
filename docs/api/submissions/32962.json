I was a SAHM for most of our kids' lives and only re-entered the workforce 2 years ago when our middle child reached kindergarten so we didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for daycare.  I have worked my way up the ladder in my chosen field of work and finally feel like I am more than just a SAHM.  \n\nThe company I work for holds a big black-tie gala for an Xmas/Holiday party every year.  Last year we were unable to attend due to me being sick so I was really looking forward to it this year.  My sister even agreed to drive 3 hours to spend the night with the kids so we didn't have to worry about a babysitter.  I bought a nice fancy dress and my husband rented a tux in preparation for the event last Friday.  \n\nThen, the week of Thanksgiving, my husband's favorite uncle passed away.  My husband didn't have a relationship with his dad growing up and his uncle didn't have kids of his own, so his uncle was definitely a father-figure for my husband even if it was in more of a \"funcle\" way.  The funeral was held the week before my work event, but because it was held in another state that required a flight, only my husband attended.  \n\nWhen he got back, I talked to him about it and he said he was sad and grieving, but also said he was fine.  Nothing about his day-to-day stuff was out of the ordinary and he did take a couple days off work after he got back to have some time for himself to process things.  \n\nMy sister arrived the day before my work event and that night my husband told me that he didn't feel up to attending the event.  His reasons were that he was socially and emotionally exhausted and the last thing he felt like doing was making more small-talk with a bunch of strangers like he had to do at his uncle's funeral.  \n\nI reminded him that my sister had just driven hours to watch the kids, I had already bought a new dress, he had rented a tux, and most importantly, this was something I was really looking forward to.  He said that I could still attend by myself, but I told him that it is also important to me that he comes with and that we hadn't had a \"date night\" in almost 6 months.  \n\nHe agreed to go but he sulked about it the entire time.  He dragged his feet getting ready, he didn't socialize, he didn't want to dance, etc.  At one point, I lost track of him and found him sitting at the bar by himself.  \n\nWhen I went to talk to him to try and get him to come socialize with me, he told me that he already told me he has no energy for that and that he only came because I \"made\" him.  I told him that if he was going to just sulk and drink alone, we might as well leave and he said \"great, lets go.\"  \n\nI told him how disappointed I was that he acted that way at an event that he knew was extremely important to me and he got defensive and told me it was my fault for dragging him there when he didn't want to go.  He's barely spoken to me since unless it's about the kids.

While I can certainly understand the excitement of attending an event, and the disappointment of it falling apart (with your sister driving and all), your husband deserved to grieve. Additionally, while he may not have been social, YOU still had the opportunity to be. I think the jab about him sulking was a bit much. \n\nWeirdly for me, the thing that bothers me the most about this story? You guys haven\u2019t had a date night in 6 months? And you made all this effort for a work event? Including having babysitters drive in? I think you need to prioritize your relationship more. Work events are not a \u201cdate night\u201d, imo. And maybe if you guys spent more time together, the communication would be better and you\u2019d have talked it out by now.", "So, to sum up\n\n\\- Your husband loses a father figure\n\n\\- You don't go with him to the funerals, but insist for him to go to a trivial party... Okay ?\n\n\\- He tells you he doesn't feel like socializing with a bunch of stranger while still grieving (less then a week after his loss).\n\n\\- You tell him how it's important to YOU that he is there while not giving a F about how he feels even if he clearly stated his sentiments in regard of the party to you\n\n\\- He comes ANYWAY (probably to shut you up) and doesn't socialize, exactly like he said he wouldn't\n\n\\- You blame him for his attitute\n\nWhere in this list of events are you not the asshole ?", "YTA - for not going by yourself.\n\nKnow you were proud of being in the work force, haven\u2019t had a date night in six months and had gone to a lot of trouble to prepare to go.  I get it because I have been in your same situation and my husband has had other needs too\u2026it\u2019s a bummer. \n\nYour husband just lost his de facto father.  He\u2019s grieving.  He told you he was mentally and emotionally exhausted which is valid given what he had just been through and just didn\u2019t feel like socializing.  Ie - he said his cup was empty. \n\nYou ignored your husband\u2019s needs and pressed him to go even though he didn\u2019t feel like it.  So - he went.  But he didn\u2019t feel like being there, didn\u2019t enjoy himself and sat at the bar just wishing he was home.  \n\nYour partner\u2019s circumstances trumped yours in this case.  You could have gone solo and enjoyed yourself and let your husband stay home - and relax - while your sister was kind enough to watch the kids anyway - while he had a break to restore himself.", "Could your sister not have gone as your date? He was honest, and it was beyond just \"I've had a busy week and I'm burnt out.\" His father figure passed away and he needed to travel by plane to attend. \n\nI know there were a lot of factors here in you wanting to go, but this was no normal circumstance that led to him being off. YTA on this one. You should have had your sister come with you if you didn't want to take someone in mourning.", "YTA in this instance, but you're not an ahole. Judging by your other comments you're frustrated with the lack of communication in your marriage and effort on your husband's part, and it came to a head at a poor time when what felt like the last straw was actually him being distant/anti-social for a reason for once. That's just the impression I'm getting, and I could be totally wrong. Either way I think you need to sit down and apologize for forcing him to go, explain why you felt it was especially important (all the planning, you were looking forward to it, he hasn't planned a date night in over six months and you need to nurture your marriage, etc). Ask how you can support his grieving process but also move forward. Give him some space for now, the holidays are going to be especially rough, but I wouldn't give up on pushing for therapy (individual and couples) after some grieving time.", ">I told him that if he was going to just sulk and drink alone, we might as well leave and he said \"great, lets go.\"\n\nYTA. He was honest with you about what he was going through and you have the nerve to be upset that he wasn't a social butterfly at your event? \n\n>I told him how disappointed I was that he acted that way at an event that he knew was extremely important to me and he got defensive and told me it was my fault for dragging him there when he didn't want to go. He's barely spoken to me since unless it's about the kids.\n\nYou completely disregarded his feelings and the fact that he is grieving a major, formative relationship in his life. You had zero grace for what he was going through then berated him for his very natural feelings. \n\nIt shouldn't be a surprise he is now hurt and distant from you. He's probably just trying to hold himself together.", "YTA.  Your husband experienced a major loss in the family.   Yes, this eas a work event and potentially a date night and you were looking forward to it.  But HE JUST LOST A CLOSE FAMILY MEMBER.  His need to grieve, IMNSHO, completely outweighs your desire for a fancy social event. \n\nAnd, for fuck's sake, the man TOLD you he was in no condition to socialize.  But you hauled him out anyway, and you are pissed with him because he was in no condition to socialize.  \n\nWhat, exactly, prevented you from going alone?  \n\nAnd what, exactly, prevented you from letting your husband sit quietly at the bar while you hobnobbed with coworkers?", "YTA.\n\nYou wanted your husband to pretend that he was having fun while he was grieving. If this event was so important for you you should have gone alone.\n\n>and most importantly, this was something I was really looking forward to.\n\nDo you really think that anything that you want is \"most important\"? YTA.", "I get it, but yes, YTA.    \n\n\nwhen a close loved one passes, it is so hard to muster up the will to socialize.  Like, it\u2019s impossible to make your face smile and be anything but sad. You should have just taken your sister as your date.", "YTA \n\nLife doesn\u2019t just revolve around you. This was a huge emotional impact your husband felt, and instead of listening to him, you\u2019re making him do the exact thing he doesn\u2019t, then, get mad when he does exactly what he said he would do\n\nThere is not a single moment in this post where you are not considered the AH\n\nYou\u2019re also probably going to be one of those people who, after thousands of people tell you what you don\u2019t want to hear, you still won\u2019t recognize or apologize and move on\n\nHe had 1 uncle. You have a party every year. It\u2019s time to get over yourself", "YTA - if only because this reads as though your excitement over this event (which you missed last year due to illness) absolutely trumped his grief at what you admit was the loss of his only real father-figure. \n\nThere are plenty of situations in life where a spouse might need to 'suck it up' and fake it 'til you make it.  But expecting him to socialize, dance, etc and being upset that he was sitting at the bar alone after he'd already been very upfront about not having the emotional bandwidth for this event is ridiculous.\n\nWhether you like it or not, it IS your fault for dragging him to this work party and expecting him to treat it like a date night when he's grieving.  And the fact that this seems like barely a blip on your radar explains why he's hardly spoken to you since.\n\nYou expected this work party to be a bigger deal to him that the grief he's working through, and that's why you're the AH.", "YTA. That sort of thing is not my jam, but under normal circumstances I would have attended and forced myself to have a little fun. But right after burying a father figure? I would resent the hell out of my SO if she tried to strong-arm me into going to some awful black tie event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou owe him an apology. \"No, my uncle just died, I'm not up to it,\" should have ended the conversation. You realize someone acting sad and 'sulking' after a death in the family is probably sad and needs your support, right?", "YTA.  \nYour husband is clearly dealing with issues and it was more important to you that he attend this event than to allow him some mental health time.  \nClearly he intended to go until life threw him a curve ball and he needed to deal with it.  Social appearances may be important but most people understand a person not attending a non-paid social event in the event of a tragedy or aftermath of a tragedy.", "YTA so much. I don\u2019t understand how someone can type all this up and somehow think their not. He warned you that he did not have it in him. Then you get mad cause he\u2019s not having enough fun. How selfish can you be? You absolutely did make him go whether you use quotation marks or not.", "YTA and the main character of the movie called life, produced by yourself, and only yourself.", "Your husband is grieving. Let him grieve. YTA.", "YTA. I'm sorry a work event isn't a date night. At such events your partner has to put on their best face as they represent an extension of you. That's not to mean they cannot be fun, but if you want a date night, take your husband out. How could you expect your husband to have fun after such a devastating loss when basically means he has to put effort on for the duration? You should have taken your sister instead.", "YTA. These things happen in life- sometimes we don\u2019t get exactly what we want. You wanted to go to this event with your husband; he was not feeling up to it. You could have gone and had a good time on your own.\n\nI do think he bears some fault for not just staying home, though. If you aren\u2019t in the right headspace for an event you shouldn\u2019t go just because your wife bullies you and spend the night bringing down the vibes.", "I mean, YTA. He just suffered the death of his father figure a few weeks ago, and was honest with you about not having the mental or emotional energy to get dressed up and go out to a work event with you. You kind of guilted him into going even though you knew he really didn't want to, and then got upset because he wasn't the life of the party. The only reason he showed up in the first place was because he was doing his best to make you happy, even though he really didn't want to go, and for good reason.\n\nI get that this was important to you, but you need to think about what he was feeling, not just what you were feeling. If your partner is grieving a recent death, don't try to guilt them into dressing up and putting on a happy face while they chit chat with strangers that you work with so you can have a good time. If you guys need a date night, maybe try going out as a couple instead of attending a company gala?", "YTA.\n\nlet the man grieve. its ok to change your mind about what you can and can\u2019t handle when you\u2019re grieving.", "YTA\n\nWhat did you expect? He literally spelled it out for you, and you forced it anyway.", "[deleted]", "YTA. He's grieving. Surely there's something else you guys could do besides go to an active social event? He will need a while to process and move on from his grief, and you should be there to help him through it, not make things worse", "YTA. Big time. You forced him to go, and you expected him to put a big phony smile on his face. YTA.", "He\u2019s grieving and you had no compassion for him.  I know you were excited but yeah YTA.  You decided that your event was priority over him grieving the loss of a dear family member.  That\u2019s not ok.", "I think in this situation you\u2019ve pushed him a bit too far at a difficult time, but it\u2019s also clear there are far bigger issues in your relationship.\n\nI think you urgently need couples counselling unless you plan on separating.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Life happens and it means that we don\u2019t always get the have the things we envisioned. But it really seems like you put an event over your husband\u2019s wellbeing here and treated him really badly. He\u2019s suffered a hard loss very recently and yet you only seem concerned about your event and how it affects you. He told you that this was going to be too much for him, but you guilted him into attending anyway, then berated him for not living up to your expectations, when he had already told you how hard it was going to be for him. Your husband is grieving, and you\u2019re being very callous and making it all about you. You should\u2019ve just went yourself and had a date night together when your husband is in a better head space.", "YTA. He was grieving but he sucked it up and went with you anyway. Even when he didn't feel up to it. You have no right to be pissed off at him for him. Behaving exactly how he told you he was going to", "Yta his uncle just died and he was grieving and u were only concerned w yourself", "YTA. He is dealing with the death of someone close. Of course he doesn\u2019t feel like going to a big party. You should have put your sis in the tux and gone with her. Let the man grieve a bit.", "YTA. You might have legitimate beefs about your relationship and how much effort he puts into it, but this was not the time to bring them up. He's grieving and you were totally insensitive to that.", "YTA\n\nI always hated going to my wife's company's work events. I never knew anybody, and everyone talked about work.\n\nI got dragged to one black tie Christmas do years ago, and I was so bored. I was also obligated by the boss of my wife's to go to her house with all her staff's families for a bbq. I spent the time entertaining my kids so my wife could enjoy herself and being hungry because there never was enough food. I refused to go in the end.\n\nThe point is that if you force your husband to go, then the chances are he won't have a good time because he doesn't want to be there. Your husband was grieving, so he did have a valid excuse for not wanting to go, and he was reasonable enough to tell you that you could go alone. You were the one who insisted that he go.\n\nWork dos should never be classed as a date night. They are for staff, not their partners, and if you and your husband don't see your colleagues outside work then he will never know anybody so won't be motivated to interact with anyone. You have now created a rod for your own back. Your husband now has a negative experience of your work events and will have less inclination to want to go to others.", "I really wanted to be on your side as I am very familiar with sulking husbands and feeling like you have to force them to do things. But I\u2019m sorry, YTA. He is grieving. And you wanted him to go to the party and socialize and be fun a week after his uncle\u2019s funeral?

There's really no getting around the fact that he was grieving a loss and had no strength for this event, but was made to go. You dismissed the reasons for his behavior as sulking\u2014that's really disingenuous. \n\nWith that said, reading your replies to various comments it seems likely you two are in a rut. I hope you can work something out to re-establish communication about your wants and needs in this relationship, which is where this and other issues seem to stem from. Good luck.", "YTA\n\nYou did make him go when he had good reason for not wanting to. You would have had a much better time going by yourself.", "YTA- Your husband told him how he was feeling, he told you he was grieving, tired and not up to socialize. You decided to ignore your partner and  go through the guilt trip route. You have only yourself to blame.", "YTA you said it yourself, the man he viewed as a father figure died less than a month ago.

It took me years to come to terms with my father's death.  Maybe you haven't been through it so don't understand?  Which gives you a small pass.

I can tell you're proud of how quickly you've worked your way up in the company, and happy to be out of the house and in the adult world again. Which is good! You deserve to be proud! This party wasn't about *the party* for you, it was about your accomplishments in the company and getting to spend fun time in the company of other adults. It can be so isolating to be a SAHM. And for three kids! That's ten years of spending most of your time with children. Edit - I read your other comments about not having a date night in six months, and I also think you were excited to have a date night you didn't have to plan yourself. So I think there's a deeper problem here about him not taking initiative and leaving you with the mental burden. \n\nBut I don't know if cajoling him was the best idea. I think you could have compromised a bit more (taken separate cars so he could leave if he wanted, schedule another date night at a fancy restaurant, ask your sister about staying another night if possible.)\n\nTLDR, I think you could have been more understanding and pressured him a bit less, and he could have either stood his ground about not going or put more of an effort into socializing once you got there.", "YTA.

It wasn't until he had to do something he didn't want to do and which didn't benefit him that he conveniently was too deep in grief. You checked in on his emotional state multiple times leading up to this and was assured he was fine.\n* He had ample time to tell you his feelings so alternate arrangements could be made.

That is a pretty big indicator that he is selfish and inconsiderate in general.\n* He didn't feel bad for backing out, nor was he apologetic. He didn't offer to make it up to you, or even acknowledge the importance to you and beg for understanding. He was annoyed and self serving about it. He also offered no 'fixes', such as buying your sister a dress, on him, or calling a friend or relative to use his tux.\n* He tried to punish you for \"making\" him go. Which is childish, unhealthy behavior. Going an not being an a-game social butterfly? Totally understandable. But actively ruining something for you? Super shitty.\n* You have burned through your empathy for him and are exasperated and fed up with him, to the point where him losing a father figure is just another burden on you.\n* You've gone through some pretty major transformations in the past short while, yet don't mention him matching you, which tends to be a sign that a couple is growing misaligned.\n* You have been asking for counseling for months and been rebuffed.\n* You have mentioned walking away/ divorcing in comments, which means you've been seriously considering it. \n\nI am going to say you guys need some marriage counseling, asap, because my suspicion on this entire thing is that you will be going to next year's gala and having an amazing time.... with a new boyfriend as your date, because you'll have gotten a divorce.", "ESH.

However, grief doesn't excuse wasting people's time, and your husband is an asshole for not telling you he wasn't going long before your sister left her house to drive 3 hours to babysit.

Loss and grief is a hard thing to navigate. \n\nPart of me also wonders how sudden this loss was. Not that losing a father figure (or anyone) is ever easy no matter how long you have time to \u2018prepare\u2019. But perhaps she misjudged how well he was coping because it wasn\u2019t unexpected?

He probably wanted to do his best to be there for her, hoping he\u2019d feel up to it, but ultimately realized he was struggling & overwhelmed & would not be able to go.\n\nAnd then he actually went anyway because she guilt-tripped him into it. \nI just can\u2019t find fault with him at all.\n\neta: I do agree with everything else you said.

Seriously answer that question.\n\nEdit: Only AITA where a woman\u2019s want for a date is a bigger thing than a man\u2019s need to grieve", "I didn\u2019t say OP wasn\u2019t the asshole. I didn\u2019t say she should\u2019ve made him go. I just don\u2019t consider waiting til the last second to say you\u2019re not going, after someone\u2019s driven 3 hours to babysit for you is \u201ccommunicating really well\u201d."]}
