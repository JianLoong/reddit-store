{"id": 14628, "submission_id": "12jrks7", "title": "AITA For Wanting To Put Up Private Property Signs?", "selftext": "Background:\n\nMy husband and I bought our house last year. We have a very long driveway (500-600 ft). We live next door to a camp for veterans. They provide housing for veterans who do not have family or housing of their own. The goal is to help them get back on their feet. We live in a rural area. The camp has about 42 acres of land total and a solid 5 that is a grassy area they can use. We have 2.5 acres and clearly defined property lines.\n\nPeople from this camp have come on our property several times and I have called and spoken with the director of the camp asking them to advise their residents to stay on the camp's property.\n\nAlso important to note:\n\nThere is a trail that runs in the woods behind our house. Partially on our property and partially on theirs. We both have our own entrance to the trail. We have no problem with them using the trail (even if it is on our property) but we have asked them to use their own entrance to enter and exit the trail.\n\nWe have a doorbell camera and another camera on the front of the house pointed towards the driveway. We do not have any other cameras but are planning on putting more cameras that aim along the sides and back of the house.\n\nIncident #1 (March 2022):\n\n2 people with dogs came up the trail and into our yard. They looked in our wishing well, went around the side of the house and near the garage. Just generally poking around. I called the camp and explained what had happened and why I was concerned. They apologized and said one of their residents was a recovering alcoholic and was known to hide alcohol and they thought there might be some on our property. I asked them to please not come on the property again and to use their own trail entrance.\n\nIncident #2 (December 2022):\n\nThis winter, I was working on a project with a friend inside. My back was to the window and she was facing the window. She said someone was walking around the front yard/driveway area. There was a man with a dog on a leash walking through the front of our yard. He went up to the camp afterwards. I did not approach him or call them this time.\n\nIncident #3 (April 2023):\n\nThe camp provides a food pantry to local veterans in the community. During this event, two people walked down from the camp and into our driveway/front yard. They had a discussion about whether or not someone lived there and poked around a bit. We have a swingset, grill, garden beds, flags, and plenty of other things that would indicate someone lives there. I called the camp and again requested that they do not come on our property.\n\nThere have been other times that they have used our trail entrance to enter or exit the trail. Probably about 5-7 times total. I have not contacted the camp when these have occurred.\n\nI want to put up no trespassing signs/private property signs but my husband said that is too much and   that I would be TA.  So, AITA? Do you have any advice how to proceed with the situation?", "created_utc": 1681316993, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jrks7/aita_for_wanting_to_put_up_private_property_signs/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also want to put up \"no trespassing\" or \"private property\" signs.\n\n2: This might make me TA because it could be seen as an overreaction.

Do it. If the people working at the center don\u2019t think they need to knock and ask permission to search your property then they aren\u2019t going to take your requests seriously. Put signs up and get more cameras to protect yourself.", "YWNBTA - Not only is it trespassing but if they et hurt on your property then you could be held liable. Once the signs go up it takes liability off you.\n\nSomething else to do is make sure that the property line is clearly visible, no gaps.", "NTA. I don't even have to read. We had a house that bordered with a huge park. When we first moved in a lady and her dog came down the hill and poked around our house. My mom told her off.\n\nAnother incident, we had deer a lot on our property because again, it was a huge forest, and we also had a apple tree. One guy was driving past our house, parked his truck on our lawn and raced out with a crossbow to hunt the deer on our  property. Again, my mom told him off and reported him. We had signs, too.\n\nThey probably won't stop, but you're definitely not wrong to put up those signs. They are trespassing. The camp can tell their residents to not go on your property, but I don's know if they have any consequences or if they even enforce them. They probably do, but this a recurring problem. The best thing to do would be to build a fence, but that's expensive. Your husband is absolutely wrong. This is also a safety issue. He needs to think about this from that perspective.\n\nYour not running the camp out of their house, you're not suggesting they don't do what they do, you are simply making sure you and your property are safe. Get your husband to read this post. Good luck.", "NTA. I would put up the signs. People may just get turned around and be confused or thinking this is just another leg on the trail. If you have signs up, then they know they\u2019re on private property. If they ignore the signs, call right away.", "NTA. I think this is a very reasonable action to take. A No Trespassing sign is just informative of boundaries, not a hostile attack. It\u2019s possible people from the camp think using the trail entrance at your house is ok since the trail is there, so the sign might help them realize without having to call the camp every time.", "NTA. You are entitled to privacy in your own house. Having strangers poking around can be very unconfortable. Putting a sign is a pretty common step to take when people keep on trespassing.\n\nEdit : If it's not enough, you can always consider buying a small manually-triggered alarm. If they come back, start the alarm. That's how I got rid of nosy neighbours when the \"PRIVATE PROPERTY\" signs were not enough", "Nta for wanting to put up signs\n\nThats how things should be done\n\n\nWanting to keep people off your property is a decision/personality thing\n\nYour husband doesnt want to rock the boat or come off\u2026rude? I dont know.  I would have no problem saying no trespassing", "NTA, this is a common sense solution", "NTA - But not sure if that will actually stop them.", "NAH\n\nIt is not entitled or selfish to want to feel safe and have privacy on your property. The signs are not aggressions, they are information. I've visited places where I unintentionally wandered into private property (like properties facing a river or such) and felt awful. I would welcome a clear line that indicates to me \"this is where someone's private property begins, please don't trespass\". \n\nIn ADDITION to the signs, if you can afford it, I would consider fencing in strategic places. Maybe lock your access to the trail? Or maybe plant shrubby things along the borders? \n\nGood fences, good neighbors and all. You are not depriving the veterans of anything.", "NTA. \n\nYou're telling the camp, but unless they have someone going around with campers one on one, putting up signs is the best, simpliest, and most effective method to let ALL of their campers know to stay off your private property.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
