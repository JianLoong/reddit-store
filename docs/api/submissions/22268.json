There is a reason you can do your taxes as married filing separately or jointly. A lot of people do marriage differently than you or I would and this couple is one of them. Just because they do it differently doesn't mean they are necessarily wrong and it doesn't mean they need to break up unless they are truly unhappy with the arrangement. \n\nMy spouse and I have merged finances, when I worked and he didn't every bit of money coming into the house was ours, now that I am not working and he is every bit of the money is still ours, and when we are both working all our money is still ours and goes into the same accounts. Anything that either of us buys is basically shared property, we have never had a set split on bills when we were both working.. And labeling something as mine or his is never a problem because that's not an issue for either of us. We both contributed to his motorcycle, both our names are on it, but that is his motorcycle. He has a truck and I have a car, when we talk about them to each other it's \"the truck or the car\" when we talk about them to others it's his truck and my car but we can both take either vehicle out whenever we want because they are ours. If I would ride the bike I could take it out too but I don't want to lmao \n\nTheir finances aren't merged though, and that makes a huge difference. He claims the money he earns is his and his alone, he has his own account that she doesn't have access to and he only pays 50% of the bills. She does the same so she is helping him save just as much as he is helping her which voids out the he helped her save excuse.
