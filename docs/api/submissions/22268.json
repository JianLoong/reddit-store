To me OP is NTA, if he doesn't want to merge finances he can't just claim something she bought on her own as shared property", "Considering they keep their finances entirely separate and split all bills 50/50 but he isn\u2019t contributing anything financially to this car, it sounds like OP thought they already had worked out these details long ago.", "normally I would agree with everything you said here. but if OP's husband is normally possessive and weird about his own belongings and money, to the point that OP keeps her money and accounts separate to avoid conflict with him, in this situation I do feel like this car is hers rather than both of theirs. It sounds like if her husband bought himself a car he would not consider it to belong to both of them.", "Lmao that's like saying because I split expenses with a roommate they have a right to claim my things as shared property since their contributions helped me save more. \n\nI get that you mean since they are married it should be \"what's mine is yours and what's yours is mine\" but they don't merge finances because he is possessive about the money he earns. What he is doing is saying \"what's mine is mine, and what's yours is mine too\"\n\nIt seems like a weird dynamic for a married couple but that's how they do it about everything else, he can't claim something she bought on her own just because he likes it NTA OP.", "  If the OP makes it clear that the car is the OP's car that means the husband doesn't get to just drive it or lend it out whenever he wants and he needs to clear usage with the OP.  For some people implied shared ownership such as they themselves constantly saying \"Ours\" without correction gets spun into \"It's partially mine so I don't need to check if it's ok which could lead to something stupid like the OP's husband taking the OP's car because his own was low on gas and he didn't want to fill it up right now.  Since we don't know  how the husband's mind works we don't really know if he's the type that constantly needs such boundaries reinforced.   It's also possible he's a \"What's mine is mine, what's yours is ours\" person if the OP doesn't hold their ground.   I don't know and I'm not saying for certain. I am just saying that there are reasons for not letting someone come to the conclusion that something is \"ours\".", "Entitlement in general, lol. No reason to bring gender into it.", "yeah, it\u2019s starting to sound a little bit like what he actually thinks is \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine and what\u2019s yours is ours\u201d. nta.", "But it isn't a roommate. It is a life partner. Break up or not, your retirement and social security is shared. That's not what happens with flat mates.", "it's wrong to ignore that historically women have been taken advantage of by men. even in today's world, women do most of the unpaid labor and are at most risk of financial abuse.", "That's not always what happens with spouses though, they have to name each other as the beneficiary of the retirement or social security. There is a reason you can do your taxes as married filing separately or jointly. A lot of people do marriage differently than you or I would and this couple is one of them. Just because they do it differently doesn't mean they are necessarily wrong and it doesn't mean they need to break up unless they are truly unhappy with the arrangement. \n\nMy spouse and I have merged finances, when I worked and he didn't every bit of money coming into the house was ours, now that I am not working and he is every bit of the money is still ours, and when we are both working all our money is still ours and goes into the same accounts. Anything that either of us buys is basically shared property, we have never had a set split on bills when we were both working.. And labeling something as mine or his is never a problem because that's not an issue for either of us. We both contributed to his motorcycle, both our names are on it, but that is his motorcycle. He has a truck and I have a car, when we talk about them to each other it's \"the truck or the car\" when we talk about them to others it's his truck and my car but we can both take either vehicle out whenever we want because they are ours. If I would ride the bike I could take it out too but I don't want to lmao \n\nTheir finances aren't merged though, and that makes a huge difference. He claims the money he earns is his and his alone, he has his own account that she doesn't have access to and he only pays 50% of the bills. She does the same so she is helping him save just as much as he is helping her which voids out the he helped her save excuse. She is only the AH if he actually contributes to the cost of the car and he doesn't..", "And now women are looking to become equals (as they should). So treat them equally."]}
