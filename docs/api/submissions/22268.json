Anything that either of us buys is basically shared property, we have never had a set split on bills when we were both working.. And labeling something as mine or his is never a problem because that's not an issue for either of us. We both contributed to his motorcycle, both our names are on it, but that is his motorcycle. He has a truck and I have a car, when we talk about them to each other it's \"the truck or the car\" when we talk about them to others it's his truck and my car but we can both take either vehicle out whenever we want because they are ours. If I would ride the bike I could take it out too but I don't want to lmao \n\nTheir finances aren't merged though, and that makes a huge difference. He claims the money he earns is his and his alone, he has his own account that she doesn't have access to and he only pays 50% of the bills.
