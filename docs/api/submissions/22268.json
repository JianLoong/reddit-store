Anything that either of us buys is basically shared property, we have never had a set split on bills when we were both working.. And labeling something as mine or his is never a problem because that's not an issue for either of us. We both contributed to his motorcycle, both our names are on it, but that is his motorcycle. He has a truck and I have a car, when we talk about them to each other it's \"the truck or the car\" when we talk about them to others it's his truck and my car but we can both take either vehicle out whenever we want because they are ours. If I would ride the bike I could take it out too but I don't want to lmao \n\nTheir finances aren't merged though, and that makes a huge difference. He claims the money he earns is his and his alone, he has his own account that she doesn't have access to and he only pays 50% of the bills.

There are only 9 community property states in the US currently which make income earned/property acquired during a marriage \\[without a separate property agreement\\] jointly owned.  Even in community property states, a spouse can acquire separate property if using separate property to purchase it and putting it in one's own name.  So if you get an inheritance during your marriage in a community property state -- it's separate property unless you \"commingle\" it with community property \\[i.e. deposit it into a joint account\\].  If you earned the money in an account prior to getting married and keep it in that separate account, it is still your separate property during marriage.  If you inherit your parents' home and rent it out, the rent you get from it is your separate property as long as you keep it separate from your spouses.  And so on and so on.  This is all without separate property agreements entered into with potential and actual spouses.  Those add in a whole new dimension of ownership/right to assets/funds acquired after marriage.", "ESH is the answer, this post reeks of a marriage where they clearly haven't efficiently communicated their goals and boundaries.

Only nine states have community property laws.", "Equally, just because commingled finances paid for it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have personal property in a marriage. Idk about legally, but functionally. \n\nI don\u2019t use my husband\u2019s personal gaming system (we have some we share) or his game save files, I don\u2019t eat his leftovers without asking, I don\u2019t use his skincare or shower products. He does the same for me, and knows to stay away from my perfumes and personal collection of animal-shaped erasers.\n\nMy parents had totally commingled finances and still had \u201cdad\u2019s car\u201d and \u201cmom\u2019s car.\u201d They allowed each other to drive their cars, because they weren\u2019t assholes, but Mom got to pick out her car (within a budget), she got first priority for driving it, she could choose to update or change it etc.", "Except for the fact that I literally see it all the time", "Lol I owned one of those.

But my favorites to drive were polar opposites: an '80 Firebird and an '11 Mazda 2. The 2 might not have been much on the freeway, but for city driving and on winding roads it was an absolute blast. I'm not the first to call it a go kart for adults.", "Never had issues with my 2011 Fiesta! I loved the heck out of Betty and sobbed when I totaled her. Deer took the driver\u2019s side headlight and everything in that corner out, busted the frame. I was going 70mph on the highway on my way to work at 2am for training in a new department and had only gotten into the right lane to avoid a driver I thought was maybe drunk. They swerved the deer and I collided. Betty kept me safe and I only had bruising from the seatbelt and airbags. Responding officer drove me to work and I worked my shift. I got almost 40mpg and could pack a ton of stuff into that little car.

This is something no one can truly know until they\u2019re put in the situation, and you are the only person talking about divorce here so that seems unlikely for op to find out anytime soon, so\u2026 what\u2019s your point?", "Since my husband and I both work from home (even before COVID) the cars really feel like they are both ours. Either way works and when we first got together we had cars that we already owned and it was more \u201cmy car\u201d and \u201chis car\u201d but now we got a Volt for saving money on gas and an Equinox for when we need to take the dogs somewhere or bring home a lot of groceries.", "Yes, just like the husband is doing now!  And given that OP's husband appears to be such a douchenozzle in general, OP might very well find out about it soon enough.  He seems very hard to take, and I would be sick of his shit if I were her.  And my point is that, for example in most US jurisdictions, regardless of whose assets they are pretending are whose, or whose pot of money paid for what, those assets are likely to be considered jointly owned.  (My strong guess is that OP would also prefer that it if it benefits her).  \n\nJust pointing out that this way of couples thinking about cars etc.- which lots of couples do, including me and my wife - is a bit of a fiction in terms of how assets are really owned at the end of the day.", "If minors cannot get a divorce because that would mean dissolving a contract, how are they able to marry in the first plce?", "Weird you aren't in a proper marriage where money is jointly shared. Why bother getting married? Should've stayed roomies.", "This is the answer!!!", "Not if you're married it's not.", "That's how my hubs and I are. He has a longer work commute sp he drives a smaller suv with better mileage. That's his car.  I drive a mini van bc I'm often driving kids around. That's my car.

But isn't just about it being community property while married.  And who officially owns it when married.  It is about who gets what when assets need to be split upon divorce.  For example, if a husband makes more money, and buys more stuff/has more assets, and a couple divorces, the court is going to split that stuff up on divorce in a way that is not to the detriment of the woman.  Regardless of whether it is a community property state or not.", "I had a 1972 Pinto in 1982 in Michigan with the floorboards rotted out.

That was not fun.", "When I met my husband, he had a 1978 Chevy Malibu that was possessed. No lie, that thing was just a crazy old man away from being \"Christine.\"\n\nWhen it snowed, a face would appear on the hood. A FACE. It was freaking terrifying.

We listen to pretty much the same music (metal) so it\u2019s just a matter of what we are feeling that day and now having it all on our phones makes it even easier.
