Why people always assume perfect strangers will judge them is beyond me, and even IF THEY DO, they are a STRANGER, it dosn't MATTER WHAT THEY THINK.

If they're squeamish and uncomfortable they can look elsewhere or move away from you. You have every right to study in public, regardless of topic.

However, IMO, YWBTA if someone asked you politely to change something while on one of your trips and you refused outright.

The first scene started with naked breasts and I quickly turned it off.\n\nHaven't been that surprised by a show or movie since I watched like 5 minutes of Donnie Darko with my dad as a teen.

It is different in that the effect may be more distressing, thought o fewer people when the stimulus is graphic imagery and not the smell of food.\n\nI can't see any difference that allows me to say the food is bad but the studying is fine because they are both cases of forcibly exposing some people to an stimulus that some reasonable people would find unpleasant, unless you place special emphasis on the intention.

I\u2019m pretty squeamish myself, and if I happened to look at your pages, I would just think blah and look away.
