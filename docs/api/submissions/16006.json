Enjoy the new wheels!!", "NTA\n\nGF is angry that OP bought a car with his own money. \n\nThat to me is not a healthy reaction. While someone might be a wee bit envious of someone else's better finances - or really anything at all - an adult doesn't act on that emotion by telling a person that they shouldn't have bought something. This is something a child would do. Part of becoming an adult is realizing that one doesn't have to say every single thought that pops into one's brain. An adult would say - what a great car - let's go for a drive up the coast this weekend. \n\nAlso OP and the GF are in completely different stages of life. OP is 31 and presumably has been working in a career for a good amount of time so is several rungs up and make a higher salary I would hope than when he was 24 and starting out. Hopefully the girlfriend is working on her career and in 7 years of working will be in a financial position commensurate with being in the work force for a decade.", "Everyone in this thread is going to be super cut and dry because it\u2019s reddit and this sub tends to be a little dense when it comes to personal relationships but i\u2019m going to risk the downvotes for this one. \n\nFirst thing, you are aware that your GF is in a bad spot financially, you guys haven\u2019t been together for an eternity so borrowing money is typically seen as a bad thing earlier on in relationships, hence why I can see why she has turned down your offers in the past for assistance. If she HAD taken the money, redditors would\u2019ve painted her as a gold digger, but I digress. \n\nSecond, you were bragging. This could\u2019ve been a casual conversation but instead it turned into showboating a new car. Considering you\u2019re an engineer I\u2019m gonna take a shot in the dark and assume that this is a fairly nice vehicle. We all brag every once in a while but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the term, \u201cnobody likes a bragger.\u201d\n\nTaking all of this into account, ESH. Could your GF have reacted a bit better? Yes, but this was also sprung on her in a time when you already are aware of her financial problems and actively chose to brag instead. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s constantly begging for money, in fact it\u2019s quite the opposite. Would you walk up to a starving homeless man and show him a big ole cart of groceries that were only for you and call HIM an asshole?\n\nETA: I completely ignored the ages the first time around. OP, there is a completely big difference in maturity between you two. There is also a very big difference financially as, again, you are an engineer, but you are also in your early 30s. A check for someone in their 30s who is waaaayyy closer to being out of debt is going to go a hell of a lot farther than someone freshly out of college entering their career field. If this is really a make or break issue then I would recommend dating someone equally as successful as you.", "I'm rolling NTA. \n\n>She told me that I am insensitive for buying my new expensive car knowing that she is struggling financially and that I'm rubbing it in her face\n\nYou've offered to help her in the past, and she's refused. NOW she's trying to throw that back in your face and call you, essentially, selfish? Nah girl, get out of here. \n\nThis is a huge red flag for you. You don't live together, You've been together for a year and you don't have joiny finances. It's your money, do what makes you happy. If you want to make a bath out of $100 bills, do it! But that wouldn't make you an ass.", "She wishes you would buy more stuff for her without her asking or she's just jealous that you can afford nice shit. NTA", "this should be higher. while OP isn\u2019t necessarily the biggest AH, what he did was tone deaf as hell. the other N-T-A responses are so unnecessarily mean toward the gf. personally my verdict would be ESH because of that. he could\u2019ve let it be a casual thing but instead chose to brag", "I agree, I would bet money on her being depressed and anxious.", "OP isn't the ah but confused how the gf is a gold digger if she's not accepting his money or asking for help?", "She's not taking his money, so....? How is she?", "If my boyfriend showed up in a new Mercedes to pick me up I\u2019d be super excited and happy for him. He works hard and deserves it. I wouldn\u2019t expect him to buy a less nice car because I can afford one too", "And in a way, he did *kiiinda* showed it off to her. He could've let her visit on her own time to see the car, instead of purposely driving to show her. He may not have been thinking of that intentionally, but his reaction to what she's telling him is tone deaf, or inconsiderate? He could've considered what she said instead of thinking, 'but I offered to help and you wouldn't have reacted like this had you taken it!' \n\nBut yeah, I definitely in this opinion as well. It would be hard to keep up a smile for someone else as you're trying to keep yourself afloat, and maybe she was really feeling it that day. I had my moments too, seeing my then boyfriend being able to buy this, and buy that and needing to have multiple cars, and then switching them out and such (and it's not like he made that super much more than me. He's a risk taker too, I stay in my budget or lower)\nAnd he already have people borrowing money from him, and an attitude of women being gold diggers/ulterior motives for something aka sexist so I definitely never felt comfortable asking him for money for any of my bills. But like, seeing him doing for others and can't even think of me when he's out like at the store or whatever (but expected me to) is what got me. Your money is yours, and you can spend it however you like, but you have no problem lending your friend's mom money, or that friend, or helping that coworker or that employee, or buy all these different shoes for cheap just to resell them overpriced, and I'm not thought of once while he did these things? But if I went to hmart, he'll ask why i didn't get him wasabi peas? Same reason you don't get me anything at the store, and you have the money to spend.", "I was in the same sitch once. DBA bf and I had just graduated and was making 10/hr. Bf bought himself a lotus and braced for my reaction. I was just stoked he had bought his dream car. It's his feckin money so wtf do I care? My financials were not his problem nor priority... they're mine.", "I don't think the issue, from what you are saying, is that you bought the car instead of helping her. And she certainly isn't taking advantage of you, she really wants to figure it out herself and is apparently very independent. I don't see red flags, personally.\n\nIt's probably just because it's hard for her to see you being able to afford something fantastic while she struggles. She probably realizes that just because she struggles, doesn't mean that no one else is able to live comfortably, but the difference is that you are someone close to her.\n\nIMO, NAH. I get the excitement over the new car and I also get why it's hard for your girlfriend to relate. She is probably not the best person to be happy for you as of right now. I don't think it's that a weird feeling, haven't we all be envious of someone else who was already at a point in their life that we were aspiring too? For example, think of how you would feel if your best friend came to you super happy because they just got accepted into their dream university while you are dealing with a rejection after having shared the same dream for years.\n\nIf it's an isolated incident, I don't think it's enough of a cause for concern.", "Agree with the other comment that economic class can also play a significant factor. But also, being in your early 20s and only a couple of years out of school is MASSIVELY different than being in your late 20s or early 30s. \n\nEarly 20s is potentially the first time you have a substantial, steady paycheck, no homework or assignments. My decisions when I was 21-26 were significantly different than the ones from 26-now. I\u2019ve heard the saying that birthdays only matter until you\u2019re in your late 20s. At least in the US, 16 you can drive, 18 you can vote, 21 you can drink, 21-25 still have that excitement of growing up. After that, at least for me, its really just the big ones, 30,40,50,etc. \n\nNTA, congrats on the new car but it sounds like there is a significant red flag around your girlfriends attitude to the purchase you made with your money that doesn\u2019t impact her at all outside of just riding in it with you.", "Dates women 7 years younger than him, those 7 years being super pivotal times in life, surprised their less mature than them.", "I concur", "Add the women's wage gap to those 7 years in the work force and she might never be his financial equal.", "And this is how we got the story of damsel in distress.\n\nShe said she doesn\u2019t want your help?

That same stress and anxiety is also likely why she doesnt want to take money from you as those are not feelings you want associated with your relationship.\n\nSo no its not on you in any way, but I am just pointing out why its easy to understand her being upset and not handling it perfectly. I wouldnt be surprised if she knows it herself and apologizes later.", "Totally this. When I was struggling and my friends weren't, it was hard to put on a happy face for them when I was hurting.

Like I just am struggling to understand what you all could have in common besides surface level stuff, and I have to wonder why you aren\u2019t dating another late 20s / early 30s person who is also more established in their life.

Just so you understand you don't owe her that, what would she do if you were not in the picture? You shouldn't co-mingle/loan money until both are sure you have a solid foundation and future together.

Of course she\u2019s going to be like WTF, she\u2019s not his mother. And it\u2019s not compensated to offer money to help her out, it\u2019s just patronising.

It was immature and childish to blow up on him when he was excited and proud. Sounds like this was the first new car he bought which is a milestone. I do not see this, or any other, relationship lasting very long if one partner cannot be happy for their SO achieving something good for themselves.
