Even with my friends in the neighborhood, I always connected more to the younger kids and felt more comfortable acting as their \u201cguardian\u201d instead of playing with the kids closer to my age.\n\nI was still a kid myself then, but as an adult, can you guess what my job is? A TA for elementary school children. Not much has changed except I realized I have social anxiety. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with being the designated babysitter or even getting along better with kids. You\u2019re their cousin and you\u2019re not being inappropriate, or somehow refusing to grow up.

Mom of 2 teenage boys. I don't think I'd want to hang out with those adults either.... However, your dad may want to bond with you a bit and include you because he may not relate to you on the same level as your cousins. Meaning, him not wanting to play Mario Party. While, as an adult, I'm happy to play games with my kids. Your cousins sound fun. Maybe give your dad a chance for a little while when you visit and then go back to your cousins. It can't hurt. Also, the adult thing.... are you on your own? Do you pay rent? I'm not sure of the expectations. And if being an adult means complaining about health problems then I don't want to be one !! Lol", "NTA. Hanging out with your cousins is not preventing you from growing up. If you were avoiding adult life stages and responsibilities, someone could say that about you, but wanting to hang around with the younger relatives isn't immature. \n\nIn time you'll have more in common with your parents' generation but no need to force it.

Have fun, I'm glad you all get along.", "NTA 100%.", "NTA as you said your hanging out with your generation in the family. Being part of that generation means that's where people you are likely to be closer in age to. Don't get me wrong as that's not always the case and I know that from my own family tree. But it sounds like while your the adult of your generation you are likely 10 to 15 years younger then the next generation. That means the things they talk about will be harder as hell to relate to because your not going to experience that for a bit longer. Can't talk in terms of much really to relate.
