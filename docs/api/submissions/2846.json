I still sit at the kids table at thanksgiving and I still open presents with all the younger kids at christmas. I don't really mind to be completely honest but as we were visiting today I went upstairs to play video games with my younger cousin. The 17 year old wasn't there so it was me plus my cousins aged 5-14. I know it's a bit of an age difference but I'm closer in age to all of them than the next oldest up (my aunt, 41). \n\nAll my older relatives talk about is health problems and vitamins and sports and things I disagree with or am not interested in. I don't mind talking to them one on one but it can be a bit exhausting being around for conversations you don't really care about, y'know?\n\nSo I came downstairs for a drink and my dad asked me where I was and encouraged me to be downstairs and talk with the adults. He wasn't being rude about it but I still politely declined as we were playing mario party upstairs and having a great time. \n\nAs we left my dad requested that I spend more time with the adults as I am an adult now. I explained that I feel like I have more fun playing with the kids. He said I could have more intellectual conversations with the adults. I agreed, not wanting to call their convos boring, but still said I had more fun with the kids. He got a little frustrated with me and says he's trying to encourage me to grow up, and that I don't have much in common with my 5 year old cousin. I agreed again, but said I also feel left out of their conversations or am made uncomfortable by their opinions and want to keep myself out of them. My dad says that I'm keeping myself from growing up by staying with the kids. I said I still want to play with my little cousins. He ended the convo there but seemed a little frustrated with me.

If he sits down at the adult table for conversation he just ends up getting shit on for being young and not knowing how the world works.

Maybe explain this in advance to your dad and frame it more in terms of you enjoy your cousins, not that you don't enjoy the older generations.", "NTA.\n\nLook, as you said they're still treating you as one of the grandkids. It's normal for you to feel out of place with people who are 2+ generations above you (You're 20, which means you're Gen Z and your aunt is gen X), especially in these conditions.\n\nWhen your father told you that you didn't have a lot in common with your 5-yo cousin, I would've answered \"And I don't have a lot in common with y'all but here I am\" or something like that. If he's not happy it's his problem not yours.", ">!All my older relatives talk about is health problems and vitamins and sports and things I disagree with or am not interested in.\n\n\nI'm 35 and I can't stand my relatives conversations. All they talk about is health problems and deaths. (And politics)\nEdit: I'm interested in politics but I'd rather not discuss it with my family members because we have very different views of it.\n\n\n\nPlus your dad's arguments make no sense in my opinion. You're an adult and you'll develop into adulthood with no issues even if you don't spend time with older relatives. Also not spending time with older relatives saves you from getting them asking you personal questions you don't want to answer, at least that was my experience.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA - This was me for my whole life. I\u2019m the youngest of the first cousins so I didn\u2019t have anything in common with them, but I\u2019m older than all of the little second cousins. When family came over, I was pretty much the designated babysitter. Which I didn\u2019t mind, I much preferred watching the kids instead of sitting around with all of the adults. Even with my friends in the neighborhood, I always connected more to the younger kids and felt more comfortable acting as their \u201cguardian\u201d instead of playing with the kids closer to my age.\n\nI was still a kid myself then, but as an adult, can you guess what my job is? A TA for elementary school children. Not much has changed except I realized I have social anxiety. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with being the designated babysitter or even getting along better with kids. You\u2019re their cousin and you\u2019re not being inappropriate, or somehow refusing to grow up. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d do fine around peers, but your family just doesn\u2019t have any.\n\nAnd anyway, Mario Party slaps. Who wouldn\u2019t prefer that to just sitting around and talking with people decades older than you?", "NTA he probably resents having to be in those conversations anyways.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in a very similar boat with my family, and honestly, it\u2019s an awkward stage until one of your cousins is old enough to have more \u2018grown up\u2019 conversations with you, but you do what brings you joy, OP. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s nice for your dad to invite you to spend time with the adults. But you\u2019re used to spending time with the kids, and still enjoy doing so. I doubt you\u2019ll have a lot in common with the grown ups. You\u2019ll probably end up sitting in a corner awkwardly whilst listening to them chat.", "So is he saying you're getting a seat at the adult table? And since you warned him that you disagree with some of the opinions you've heard expressed, are you going to be allowed to say so, to challenge these opinions? Or is your dad going to want avoid arguments, and ask you to keep your opinions to yourself while the \"real\" adults discuss things? Is he sure he wants you there for more than appearances if you're not going to sit quietly in the corner? Ask him these questions. \n\nBut you are NTA for hanging where you're comfortable.", "Wow NTA, even older than that when with extended family for Xmas they always expected me to hang with the kids and little ones. While some of the older kids were fine I don't like babies and was not going to spent my visit sitting with a drooling potato that didn't speak.\n\nI think in most families the oldest kid is kind of pushed to watch them so 'adults' can drink. I always made them pay me for it lol.\n\nIt's nice you get along with yours and they should appreciate that you keep the kids busy so they can complain about politics and vitamins or wevs.", "Hi so NTA. Mom of 2 teenage boys. I don't think I'd want to hang out with those adults either.... However, your dad may want to bond with you a bit and include you because he may not relate to you on the same level as your cousins. Meaning, him not wanting to play Mario Party. While, as an adult, I'm happy to play games with my kids. Your cousins sound fun. Maybe give your dad a chance for a little while when you visit and then go back to your cousins. It can't hurt. Also, the adult thing.... are you on your own? Do you pay rent? I'm not sure of the expectations. And if being an adult means complaining about health problems then I don't want to be one !! Lol", "NTA. Hanging out with your cousins is not preventing you from growing up. If you were avoiding adult life stages and responsibilities, someone could say that about you, but wanting to hang around with the younger relatives isn't immature. \n\nIn time you'll have more in common with your parents' generation but no need to force it. It's not fair for your dad to say something so cruel in this situation. He needs to chill.", "NTA\n\nMost posts have the older relatives pawning off the younger kids on the oldest kid for baby sitting.  You family should be grateful you want to be with the younger kids.", "NTA Just because you hang out with your younger cousins doesn't mean that you aren't an adult. Your family can't tell you that you need to spend time with the adults when your interests and opinions are different or conflict with their own. Playing video games and the like is so much more enjoyable then talking about politics and other adult issues.", "NTA. You and the cousins will keep hanging out together into your 20s and 30s, too, even as you start to marry and  bring a new generation in and talk more adult shop, too. Have fun, I'm glad you all get along.", "NTA 100%.", "NTA as you said your hanging out with your generation in the family. Being part of that generation means that's where people you are likely to be closer in age to. Don't get me wrong as that's not always the case and I know that from my own family tree. But it sounds like while your the adult of your generation you are likely 10 to 15 years younger then the next generation. That means the things they talk about will be harder as hell to relate to because your not going to experience that for a bit longer. Can't talk in terms of much really to relate. Most of what you would be missing out on are stories from when they where younger.", "NTA\n\nI'm 35 and I'd rather be upstairs playing Mario", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
