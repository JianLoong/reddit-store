This diagnosis has clarified things for me and given me a direction to go with treatment, but it's caused quite a bit if a struggle with my mom and my dad. \n\nEarlier this week, my dad sat me down and asked me of I would go to this therapy camp place to get treatment for my schizophrenia. The catch? This place was extremely religious and I am very much not. I wouldn't say that I don't believe in Jesus, I do, I just wouldn't associate myself with Christianity as a whole due to a dislike of organized religion.\n\nI tried to say no. I wasn't interested in going. At the very least, I wanted time to think about it. My dad asked me what there was to think about and claimed that if I didn't go, then I didn't want help.\n\nThis upset me. Of course I want help. I was in the process of getting help already, having just started with a new therapist and having been taking medication to treat my symptoms for over a year.\n\nHe pressed and eventually, I gave in. After all, how bad could it be?\n\nIt was bad.\n\nIn the morning, there was devotion, breakfast, and chapel. Three times a day, there was \"group therapy\" which was basically an hour and a half each of Bible study. Throughout the day, there were one on one appointments where you would talk about your relationship with Christ and nothing else. \n\nI hated it. It was like they were trying to shove their beliefs down my throat while claiming that they were a community; a family of sorts.\n\nI was miserable. I came to this place for help with my Schizophrenia, not to be \"rescued from the clutches of the devil.\"\n\nI also received lots of judgement and dirty looks when it came out that I was trans and dating someone born as my own gender assigned at birth. Many attempts were made by other patients to \"save me\" and they claimed that the first step to healing was admitting I was a dirty sinner.\n\nSo, I started plotting my way out of there. We were allowed to keep our phones, so I made a Gofundme. In my desperation, I worded it harshly and frantically typed out some things that I didn't quite mean. Admittedly, it painted Christians, at least the Christians at this camp, in a bad light.\n\nLuckily for me, my LARP group found the Gofundme and, within a day, my goal was reached. I could afford a plane ticket to go home.\n\nBefore I flew home, I was taken aside by the camp director, \"therapists\", and other patients, all begging me and laying on the guilt trip to get me not to go home. They claimed that I must not love or respect my parents if I didn't want to stay here.\n\nI steeled myself and went to the airport to fly home.\n\nThe problem?\n\nMy parents found the Gofundme.\n\nToday I have to meet with my dad to explain why I refused what's, in his words, life changing help. After having so many people in my life tell me I should have stayed, I can't help but wonder if they're right.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694362650, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f4bdt/aita_for_leaving_a_religious_therapy_camp_early/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't owe those fucking people anything, and I think it's absolutely imperative that you start figuring out how to move out.", "NTA. Yeah, that place was not good for you and was not going to help you and you clearly needed to get out. Religion will not rid you of Schizophrenia and I do not know why your parents don't seem to understand that. Could they also have been hoping they'd scare / Jesus the trans out of you, too? If are living with them, I'd advise working on getting out, and if you are already out, limit contact.", "Sorry you had to experience that, it sounds horrible.  But impressed with your LARP friends helping to bail you out of a bad situation.  \n\nYou didn't refuse life changing help because you weren't getting any.  Your dad seems to think that mental illness is something you can just pray away, sorry, it doesn't work like that.  You weren't getting therapy or any skills to learn how to manage your diagnosis, just a faith based turn it over to god.  Which in the face of schizophrenia could be really dangerous, leading your to believing voices are devils/angels sending you messages.  \n\nStick to conventional therapy, you were right to get yourself out.  NTA", "NTA. Your parents didn't send you there to help with your schizophrenia. Your parents sent you there because they think you are struggling with demons, the devil, and God is the only way you can be saved. I wouldn't put it past them to think this schizophrenia is punishment for being Trans and \"Gay\", and your parents is of the opinion that if your repent and ask forgiveness from God, your Schizophrenia will be cured.\n\nStick with your LARP community. I've been part of a LARP community before and while there are the occasional rotten egg, the community as a whole is very supportive of each other.", "No no no no no! You are NTA. Mental illness requires real meds and therapy, not religion and exorcism. And yes, I\u2019m a Christian.", "NTA - that\u2019s weird. Honestly, religion is not a good substitute for actual professional help. Don\u2019t let them guilt trip for leaving either. Focus on yourself and getting better.", "NTA. That place is NOT medical help. It will not help you.", "INFO: Was this actually a gay conversion therapy camp?", "NTA. Religion ain't gonna fix schizophrenia.", "NTA those places are unregulated and very often openly abusive.  That's not how you treat mental health issues at all.", "NTA - Are you safe with your parents?", "NTA. I'm cringing over this whole thing. Religious therapy camp is to change you and indoctrinate you, not help with any diagnosis. \n\nI would tell you father that you are going to find a secular therapist that specializes in PTSD/schizophrenia. If you have time before you meet, ,maybe google some names in preparation.\n\nI'm an agnostic and dislike organized religion because of a Christian summer day camp my aunt sent me to. It was traumatizing and shaming and that was just day camp, I can only imagine the shaming that went on at this place.\n\nRemind your father that a belief in God is an everyday and everywhere experience. You don't have to be in church to be close to God.\n\nGood luck!!!!", "NTA\n\nYou were right to escape.", "NTA.  I'm so glad you made it out of there. You should never be pressured like that.", "NTA.\n\n1.) You have a medical condition, not a spiritual one\n2.) These places are not there to help you, they are just there to catch people for their tribe. It is a selfish place. \n3.) This sounds like a cult, and they are trying tk brainwash you. Especially considering all the hard guilt-tripping they are doing.\n\nIs you father a christian fanatic?  That je guilt trios you too from the starrs and manipulated you in the camp is like a big warning sign regarding this dude.", "NTA being brainwashed into ignoring scientific facts about your condition is absolutely not what you need. Your father doesn't care about what's going to help you, he's ashamed and wants to believe your issues can be preyed away. They cannot. \n\nFurthermore, you are, legally speaking,  an adult. You do not have to meet with your parents and frankly, I would advise against doing so. They don't have your best interests at heart. There's every possibility that they could try and force you to return to the camp or send you someplace worse against your will.", "Your parents need to be cut off before they actively hurt you. Schizophrenia is NOT helped by that garbage and those places are predatory. They put my grandmother in one of those places because she was hallucinating demons because she was developing dementia. Everything got worse. Please stay on your meds and do not tell these people anything. \n\nGood luck with your partner and everything.", "NTA- religious therapy camps, are not mental health programs. You need a real mental health program, with real therapists and psychiatrists. People who are actually qualified to help you.\n\nGood for you for going home to find real help.", "Tell your dad putting \"therapy\" in the title of the camp, doesn't make it mental health treatment- period. This is not treatment, in fact it is anti-treatment (aka damaging) and laying on a further layer of shame based thinking onto your already difficult experience of symptoms. We therapists have ethics codes and this significantly violates several. \n\nYou love being religious and want to hang out and learn with other people who feel the same- great. But not being interested has not one thing to do with not wanting to get better and motivated  for mental health treatment. So tell Dad that angle of his argument is no longer a part of the discussion.", "NTA. Schizophrenia can't be brainwashed away.", "You are 100% NTA.   \n\n\nYou're an adult.
