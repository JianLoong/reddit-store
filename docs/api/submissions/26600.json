This diagnosis has clarified things for me and given me a direction to go with treatment, but it's caused quite a bit if a struggle with my mom and my dad. \n\nEarlier this week, my dad sat me down and asked me of I would go to this therapy camp place to get treatment for my schizophrenia. The catch? This place was extremely religious and I am very much not. I wouldn't say that I don't believe in Jesus, I do, I just wouldn't associate myself with Christianity as a whole due to a dislike of organized religion.\n\nI tried to say no. I wasn't interested in going. At the very least, I wanted time to think about it. My dad asked me what there was to think about and claimed that if I didn't go, then I didn't want help.\n\nThis upset me. Of course I want help. I was in the process of getting help already, having just started with a new therapist and having been taking medication to treat my symptoms for over a year.\n\nHe pressed and eventually, I gave in. After all, how bad could it be?\n\nIt was bad.\n\nIn the morning, there was devotion, breakfast, and chapel. Three times a day, there was \"group therapy\" which was basically an hour and a half each of Bible study. Throughout the day, there were one on one appointments where you would talk about your relationship with Christ and nothing else. \n\nI hated it. It was like they were trying to shove their beliefs down my throat while claiming that they were a community; a family of sorts.\n\nI was miserable. I came to this place for help with my Schizophrenia, not to be \"rescued from the clutches of the devil.\"\n\nI also received lots of judgement and dirty looks when it came out that I was trans and dating someone born as my own gender assigned at birth. Many attempts were made by other patients to \"save me\" and they claimed that the first step to healing was admitting I was a dirty sinner.\n\nSo, I started plotting my way out of there. We were allowed to keep our phones, so I made a Gofundme. In my desperation, I worded it harshly and frantically typed out some things that I didn't quite mean. Admittedly, it painted Christians, at least the Christians at this camp, in a bad light.\n\nLuckily for me, my LARP group found the Gofundme and, within a day, my goal was reached. I could afford a plane ticket to go home.\n\nBefore I flew home, I was taken aside by the camp director, \"therapists\", and other patients, all begging me and laying on the guilt trip to get me not to go home. They claimed that I must not love or respect my parents if I didn't want to stay here.\n\nI steeled myself and went to the airport to fly home.\n\nThe problem?\n\nMy parents found the Gofundme.\n\nToday I have to meet with my dad to explain why I refused what's, in his words, life changing help.

They are going to try again and again to force you into the religiously mandate \"traditional\" role and lifestyle and do not recognize that there is something medically/psychologically wrong with you that you will need to work on for the rest of your life. They can only see you being \"sinful\" and that you need to be \"fixed\". \n\n**The next part is what you need to watch out for: They might try to force you into a conversion camp/troubled child/forced \"reeducation\" camp next.** You're over 18, an adult legally, but there are still cases of parents trying to trick, or hiring people to force, their adult children into these abuse camps that basically just brainwash and abuse those \"admitted\" to the camp until they follow the fucked up rules. \n\nGet ready to find a way to be fully independent from your parents, and be cautious about going anywhere with them without having a clear \"out\".

I was religious which meant the voices I heard were all either from gif or the devil and the delusions I had were all revelations. When I thought demons plagued me I prayed and thought that would solve it. Turns out prayer does nothing but medication and therapy can help silence a lot of the voices and \u201crevelations.\u201d\n\nIt took me a long time to seek help and get a diagnosis due to religion and I bet a camp like this would\u2019ve set me back further. OP staying would\u2019ve only harmed them in the long run. Not to mention the transphobia of the camp and homophobia that could lead to further distress in OP causing their mental health to decline. The whole thing makes me sick and I\u2019m glad OP left, definitely nta.", "Religion doesn't encourage it. The first millennium saints were declared by popular acclamation, meaning the cries of \"Santo Subito\" at his funeral would've been enough to Canonization Pope Saint John Paul II; it isn't. \n\nThere's a huge investigation into the lives of those whose Cause for Canonization is opened and it can take hundreds of years to be canonized. Once the cause is opened they examine the person's life, their writings and interview people they knew who are still alive.", "Btw, it's also totally ok to not believe in Jesus.", "I believe I understand your reasoning and OP's community certainly went above and beyond the call here. My understanding of PTSD suggests that the faster you get sufferers away from stressors the less likely they'll have an episode, which is what would usually land them in jail or under an involuntary hold. I'd personally rather roll the dice on getting a friendly paramedic than risk a psychotic break while waiting for a gofundme to come through. Then again, most of my experiences with PTSD are from ex-military which may be a different standard."]}
