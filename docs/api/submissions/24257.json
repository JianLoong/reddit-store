You are acting misogynistic and \"slut\" shaming your niece.\n\nIT is more than fine for you to talk to your daughter about how YOU feel about HER participating in those activities.  THAT is your business as a parent.  But your son and you/husband can stop judging your niece.\n\nDid you have premarital sex??? Did your Husband?  How many partners did either of you have?  How about your son?  Is he a pristine virgin?\n\nI'm pretty sure there's a bible passage about not judging others--so take that on board maybe???", "If your son also calls boys who sleep around \"manwhore's\" than N T A\n\nIf he's slutshaming just his cousin, your niece, then definitely YTA. You, your daughter who told your son, and your son who basically told your family's thoughts about her to her face.\n\nThank God your daughter isn't copying her cousin's behaviour, just your bullying behaviour...", "Nta reddit loves to sleep around.", "NTA your niece can do as she wishes but as your son stated his opinion. other people could or could not see it the same way. Actions have consequences and if people agree or not reputation follow people. Yes people are more sexual open but that is not for everyone.\n\nI would have a sit down with your daughter and explain safe ex at the minimum but also explain that actions have consequences. Meaning that people can talk and what they do will/can follow them in the future. Explain that people talk about what they do with people and to be careful with her actions. Make sure she can talk with you about anything with no judgment.", "NTA. You're doing the right thing by shielding your daughter from that slutty behavior. Your son probably could have said it in a better way but that just makes him untactful, not an asshole. The truth hurts sometimes and your niece needed to be called out at some point. Great job Mom and Dad!", "YTA - You are seriously okay with your son calling women sluts? Really?", "YTA- So you taught your son to be a judgmental, misogynistic, rude, confrontational asshole, and you're here bagging about his shitty behavior and justifying the bullshit views you taught him?", "YTA.\n\n1.  What a horrible thing your son said to your niece.  You all don't even know if it's true or not.\n2. It's not your place to \"discipline\" someone else's child.  If you can call this \"discipline\".  \"WeLl SoMeOnE nEeDs To TeLl HeR\".  Give me a break.\n3. You must think your parenting skills are pretty shitty to think that your daughter has such a weak character that she would be so easily influenced.\n4. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE - YOU ARE ALL JUST BULLIES.  AND YOU ARE ALL BULLYING A LITERAL CHILD.\n\nYou are horrible parents raising your kids to be just as horrible.  I feel sorry for them.", "YTA and you ARE misogynistic. You and your whole family", "Sister has a town b*ke daughter..and everyone else is a bad parent??

Lmao.", "YTA.", "The fundamentam issue is, OP is an immature, sl_t-shaming asshole - hard to teach lessons you yourself never learned.\n\nAnd OP did marry someone exactly like them, good for them. Except these kids are being raised by *two* assholes. Hopefully the son can still turn it around, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nAnd hopefully the daughter can distance herself from this toxicity in the future.", "I agree that promiscuity isn't taboo anymore. And I think that OP sounds more judgemental because she's talking about a girl. \n\nBut I'm still concerned when I ear a teenager having \"casual\" sex, boy or girl. I don't think they have enough discernment to be able to judge a person's character, to not easily fall in the hands of sexual predators (many 16 y old loves to be around 20+ years old). \n\nTo have casual sex, you have to have control over your emotions, you have to know how to separate relationships from fwb and from a one night stand. You have to know your expectations and to know how to ask for the other person's expectations. You have to know your boundaries and be able to stick up to them. Many adults struggle with that. So a 16 year old kid? I'm not sure it will all be rainbows and unicorns. Because the kid's still learning. And the repercutions (mental and physical) can be really bad. \n\nI'm glad that the society I live in is open about sex and I won't be the crazy mom who will forbid my daughter (I don't have a son but my reaction would have been the same) to bring her partner home or to sleep with her partner in the same bed at 16. But if I know she's having casual sex at parties with possibly random strangers, I will have a serious talk about it with her. Because she is unknowingly putting herself in danger. She can end up really hurt or end up hurting someone. \n\nSomething not being taboo doesn't mean it's safe and everybody should go for it. It means that we should talk and learn about it.", "This. YTA.", "LMAO this. Apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree at all, they aunt and niece were 100% right abt every negative thing they said to OP and her excuse of a son", "That really is an insult to pigs.", "Exactly. They should talk and learn about about. Not shame them for it. \n\nWhen I said promiscuity isn't taboo, I mean in general. She doesn't want her kids to grow up and be promiscuous. Promiscuity isn't bad.", "Ask your husband and son the same thing. If it was a 16yr old boy how would they feel. I bet you're gonna get a different answer bc they are boys. Either way YTA bc you all could simply *mind your business*", "You are a petty and disgusting human and I genuinely feel sorry for anyone in your range.", "So where's the criticism for the sixteen year old boys she was hooking up with? They're sluts too, right?", "Yeah for 16 year olds too. Are you jealous? Seriously only women that are unattractive and jealous of teenage girls treat the with such toxicity. \nAccept the rating and be a better human going forward. Apologize to your niece and her mother and tell your family you will not continue being an awful human. Touch grass while you are at it.", "You don\u2019t have have any say in what your kids sex lives providing they can legally consent. You don\u2019t have to like it.

I share secrets with my friends and i expect them to keep it a secret and vice versa.", "Or at least very much wants to be. Envy is the root of a lot of malice.", "I'm sure OP is one of those \"boys will be boys\" people.", "I swear that's all of these people like OP's problem.

Get to therapy you have issues he\u2019s jealous bc he\u2019s not getting his duck wet", "The \"No girls are interested\" is based on my experience with my HS students. A dude who calls other girls \"sluts\" is considered undateable by most of the HS girls I teach. \"if he talks about other girls like that, that's how he'll think of me\" which is honestly more mature than I remember being in HS. \nYou also need to learn what \"maybe\" and \"who knows\" mean.", "Yeah, it just sounded like they were suggesting that flirting was bad, or as bad.
