These things happen. Yes you overreacted, but you were disappointed.\n\n2) Your stepdad is baiting you because of your anger issues. Not sure why that would be, but it's a possibility.\n\nThe only way you can know for sure is to examine the triggers for why you lose your temper. Reflect rather than react. If you reflect on why you got angry after each episode, you might find not only the causes of your anger, but if anyone is pushing your buttons deliberately to make you look bad.", "Nta it is against the law to open mail not yours.

All these people saying you NTA for blowing up like that obviously can\u2019t communicate like adults either.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have opened your package and you could have handled it better.

Life is too short", "ESH. Sure, he opened a package. but what's the big deal? I understand that he ruined the present but the reaction was a bit over the top. You both blew it out of proportion.

Look, I get why you're mad. But unless your stepdad has a history of opening up your mail or doing other bad deeds, accidents happen.  I've accidentally done this, as have other members of my family.

There was no need for you to be so vulgar and disrespectful.", "ESH, you're understandably upset. And he should have checked the label first. But it's always good to communicate. If I order a gift for hubby, I tell him not to open anything with my name (he usually doesn't anyway, but might not check the label carefully otherwise). Maybe this could've been avoided if you told your parents you were expecting something. I think your frustration is understandable but your reaction wasn't great.", "Nta, your name was on it. You could apologize just to refuse tension and explain you feel like your privacy is violated. Or don\u2019t cz fck him", "NTA\nLiterally had your name on it. Also, if USPS delivered it.

I think this warrants a conversation with your step dad about checking names before opening packages. If this happens all the time, then yeah I can understand your frustration. But it seems like this was an isolated occurrence, and your reaction was not warranted. I know I myself don\u2019t always check the names on my package, I\u2019m the home owner so I assume the package is for me. I think you owe your step dad an apology & a conversation so you guys can prevent this from\nHappening again", "First of all, it is not a felony to accidentally open someone\u2019s mail in the US. It\u2019s only a felony to do it intentionally. \n\nTo the matter at hand, NAH if he really accidentally opened your package. He may have been expecting one himself. If he or your mom regularly get packages and you don\u2019t and didn\u2019t warn anyone, it\u2019s highly likely they thought it was theirs. The whole exchange between the two of you was childish, though. I\u2019m guessing when he said he didn\u2019t see your name on it, it wasn\u2019t said in a sarcastic way but a truthful one. You were just already too mad to see that. You both need to grow up a little and apologize. \n\nYou know you have anger issues. You should know the proper way to respond when someone does something wrong to you. Even if your stepdad was being sarcastic, you could\u2019ve handled it better and still made it a situation where your mom felt like you were giving her the gift from the box.", "NTA.
