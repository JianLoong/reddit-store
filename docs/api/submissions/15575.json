{"id": 15575, "submission_id": "12xh5yk", "title": "AITA for not inviting my step-sisters to my wedding?", "selftext": "I (29) and my fiance (30) got engaged 2 years ago. During those 2 years, my fiance (John) and I would go back and forth about how we wanted the wedding to go. Initially we thought it would be about 150 people. This gave me a lot of anxiety and after some discussions, and therapy, we decided that a small wedding would be a good compromise. We\u2019re down to less than 30 people and we\u2019re happy and excited with what we\u2019re planning so far.\n\nWhich brings me to the problem at hand. Since we\u2019re having a small wedding, we can only invite so many people. My fiance has a large immediate family, so his side takes up more than half the guest list (which is fine by me since I would\u2019ve gone ever smaller for a wedding if we could\u2019ve.) I wanted to invite people that were very involved in my life and so I decided not to invite my step-sisters (30,32). It\u2019s not that I dislike them or anything, it\u2019s just that we don\u2019t talk and don\u2019t really have a relationship.\n\nBackground info: my mom (56) and my step-dad (65) married when I was 8/9 and my step-sisters did not live with us after that. We saw them every now and then for hallmark vacations. Now, I see one of my step-sisters maybe once a year (and do not talk to her otherwise) and I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to the other in over 8 years. No dislike, just indifference for the most part.\n\nMy mom is now throwing a fit. She\u2019s claiming my step-dad won\u2019t attend and won\u2019t give me a definitive answer about who is or isn\u2019t going with her. I haven\u2019t talked to my step-dad yet about whether or not he won\u2019t attend. My bet is that my mom is claiming he won\u2019t come but hasn\u2019t actually talked to him about it. \n\nSo, AITA for not inviting my step-sisters to my wedding?", "created_utc": 1682345608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12xh5yk/aita_for_not_inviting_my_stepsisters_to_my_wedding/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you don't tell me your choice by (date), then I will assume neither of you are attending and there will not be space for either of you at the wedding.\" \n\nShe is going to respond badly to this.
