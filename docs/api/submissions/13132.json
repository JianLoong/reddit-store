Navy I'm thinking.", "I get where you are coming from so slightly NTA but my Grandfather was the same way except for him, he wanted all 3 of his grandkids (me and my mom's twin sisters two boys) to become a farmer and take over his farm for him. Well I chose not to do that but the boys have and I have been excluded from the family partly do to that and other things as well that happened. They treated me like garbage my entire life compared to babying those two boys. It is what it is unfortunately. And yes, my Grandfather and his brother both served in the military and both were honorably discharged. His brother was always good to me but I hardly got to see him when he was living. You just have to roll with the punches or go no contact because let me tell you, once parents pick their favorites, there isn't anything you can do to change that. My mom was never good enough for my Grandfather but her sister was the favorite with both their parents and it hasn't changed.", "ESH\n\nYour dad is an AH, clearly, for the way he\u2019s treated you. I can imagine it\u2019s very difficult and hurtful to constantly be reminded of how your dad feels about your choices.\n\nIt is also a huge dick move to denigrate someone\u2019s service to the country. Logically I think you know that the military requires all kinds of people in all kinds of support roles in order to function. In the military you also don\u2019t have a ton of choice where you\u2019re stationed and what you do. For regular enlisted folk skills are assessed and you go where your skills can best service the branch of military as a whole. Your fathers service to his country and patriotism are core to his identity, I think it\u2019s logical to expect some fallout from this.", "YTA for telling him his 26 years of military service means nothing and you\u2019ve done as much for this country as your father has. You haven\u2019t and it\u2019s gross you\u2019d even say that. Yeah, he\u2019s $hitty for his comments about being disappointed, but you knew his requirements when it came to paying for school. Harsh, sure, but trade schools aren\u2019t as expensive as university so there\u2019s that for you. Votechs are careers are just as important as any, especially electricity. He\u2019s proud of you, you\u2019re missing that part I feel, and focusing on the preface of that statement. You\u2019ve stormed out and left, he knows how you feel, you belittled his 26 year military career and said it doesn\u2019t count because he didn\u2019t deploy\u2026you don\u2019t get to say that. I get to say that, as a retired veteran, when it comes from me it\u2019s understood as lighthearted joking between services. How we, I find it difficult to believe he never deployed as a mechanic and that he was only a mechanic for 26 years. He was high ranking and well respected.\n\nTL;DR-yes, YTA for telling him his military service doesn\u2019t count as a sacrifice for our country because he didn\u2019t deploy. He\u2019s crappy for his prefacing how proud he is of you even though he\u2019s disappointed you\u2019re not some kind of civil servant. Losing your cool, not cool, but understandable", "NTA. The attitude that serving in the military makes you better than everyone else needs to die. He can be disappointed that you chose not to join up but treating you as somehow lesser because of that is shitty parenting of the highest order.", "LOL What a sad little farce. Sounds like your Dad bases his authority in the family on this fiction of him as a war hero. You simply deflated that lie with logic, and he's thrown his toys out of the pram. \n\nIt's not that his career isn't a valuable or honorable one, or that his wages didn't support your family. It's that he's defined \"service to your country\" based on his own very narrow definitions, and uses it as the basis for being the one who calls the shots in the family. Even when he is wrong, you are told to respect his \"service\".\n\nNTA", "This\n\nMilitary parents make sacrifice for the country, but their children are forced to make sacrifice...\n\nNTA", "that pride is just a non fungible currency a country deal with to justify that service. whether he felt it or he did not, he's done the same job and made a living along the way. in that sense NTA\n\nbut you can win a battle and still lose a war. I would advise against taking that from him, he uses it because there isn't much other purpose to fly on.", "And a crappy father.", "Found the Dad's Reddit account.", "If he\u2019s proud of OP why didn\u2019t he pay for school? Why is he still harassing OP to join the navy?\nMaybe he is but he\u2019s not saying it in a believable way.", "He hasn't served his country anymore than I have served mine. He has belittled his sons very valid career choice. Military service is put on such a pedastal in the US. An electrician is serving the economy and citizens of a country just as much as a mechanic in the military who hasnt left the country to go on tours of engagement.", "not for the country just for the politicians. he should have served the country by working for the parks and recreation department", "Seems like OP\u2019s dad said he\u2019d pay for university if they went a specific route and OP didn\u2019t. He can be proud of his son without having to pay for trade school. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s harassing OP, since he only sees them twice a year. Maybe he\u2019s saying the disappointment part in a joking way and the proud part sincerely. Seems like OP has a lot of pent up resentment that finally had enough pressure applied to make him go off. Parents don\u2019t have to pay for their kids\u2019 higher education, it\u2019s great if they can afford to, or want to, but it\u2019s not an parenting requirement", "I agree, trade careers are important and society relies on them. I also agree military service is put on a pedestal and there are some that serve and are pieces of $hit. However, OP\u2019s father served for 26 years. OP doesn\u2019t know what his dad went through, even without deploying. I\u2019m not saying veterans deserve special treatment, but I am saying it\u2019s disrespectful when someone that hasn\u2019t served says they\u2019ve served as much as a service member. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not in the US, based on \u201ctours of engagement\u201d term. There are electricians in the military, too, just like there are mechanics in the civilian world.", "A tour is a tour of service. A soldier in the UK might say \"I served in Iraq\" or \"I've been on two tours to the Balkans.\" No one would say they have toured or served by fixing cars in Basildon."]}
