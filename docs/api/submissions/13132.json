OP's dad is a mechanic who never deployed, I'm sure the US military could have found another mechanic if daddy went did something else instead, so how is that more important or deserving than something else? (I might have gotten off on a tangent here. Sorry about that. I just don't get how it's more important to be a mechanic in the military than a mechanic outside the military.)\n\nIf OP had just said his dad's time in the military wasn't worth something out of the blue, that would have been an asshole move. But come on,  that dad is an idiot and no wonder his kid will become fed up, when his dad doesn't think he's good enough. Which is what he's saying, everytime he says OP's life choice of being an educated person with a job, isn't good enough for him.", "are there any living presidents who WOULDNT be extradited for crimes against humanity?", "> Like, why does an unenlisted midwife qualify?\n\nI would assume that it has something to do with having a vagina while OP doesn't.", "no he cant eat ALL the eggs right?", "... Jimmy Carter maybe at a stretch?", "I just had to search \"did Jimmy Carter die?\"", "I don't recall all the living USA presidents and didn't want to be mean esp while too lazy to look it up... but I do believe you're right hah", "10\\10", "Clinton", "yea shes serving her country by birthing new soldiers to kill pregnant women in the middle east or die trying", "yea the news really already finished mourning him. the only president who actually tells the truth so journalists been ignoring him forever and they will keep ignoring him till hes dead and can no longer speak 4 himself so they can just put words in his mouth"]}
