Kate is amazing and the cutest, sweetest person ever. I adore her! Kate is especially cute when she's looking for something and can't find it, walking around with her nose scrunched and talking to herself out loud, sometimes asking the lost object where it's hiding.\n\nAbout 2 years ago just to watch Kate be adorable looking for stuff, I started randomly hiding or moving things. (Not all the time, maybe 2-3 times a week.) Her keys, purse, pen, phone, etc... And every time Kate scrunched her face, talks to herself, and asks the object where it is and why it's hiding from her. I always help her find it after a few minutes or put it back in it's regular spot and say we must have overlooked it. Kate is always happy to find what she's looking for and I get to enjoy my wife being the adorably quirky person she is.\n\nI was hanging out with my sisters recently, they're both older than me, mid-30s and they both love Kate. We were talking and I told them what I'd been doing and they both blew up at me calling me an asshole and bad husband. They said Kate probably feels like she's losing her mind and forgetful, and feels really guilty over something I'm causing. I tried telling them there was no harm, Kate doesn't know it's me, but if she says its negatively impacting her I'll stop. I love Kate, I'd never hurt her.\n\nMy oldest sister ended up calling Kate while I was driving home and told her what I'd told my sisters. Kate went off on me, she's never done that before, saying I've been making her feel like she's and idiot and doubting herself. She ended up going to her parent's and they called to yell at me too. I tried explaining I only do it because Kate is so darn adorable when she's a bit frazzled and it's only a little joke but they all refuse to listen to me. \n\nI don't feel like I did anything really bad, just having some fun that in the long run is pretty harmless.

I'd wager to say you are doing this constantly.\n\n\n>Her keys, purse, pen, phone, etc\n\nSo, you are hiding things that when lost can cause an immense amount of stress... several times a week? If she's looking for her keys, she's trying to prepare to go somewhere or do something. Her purse- that is her purse, with important daily necessities. Her phone- seriously? It's her phone, an expensive device that keeps her in touch with people and provides leisure activities.\n\n\n>Kate is always happy to find what she's looking for and I get to enjoy my wife being the adorably quirky person she is.\n\nYou are a selfish prat. You are increasing her stress for your enjoyment. How do you feel when you have misplaced one of your important and valuable belongings?

You should listen to your big sisters.\n\n\n>I tried telling them there was no harm, Kate doesn't know it's me, but if she says its negatively impacting her I'll stop.\n\nThere is so much harm in this! You are hiding things that are integral to a comfortable day. To top it all off, you are taking joy in it. You are taking joy in her (potential) suffering. This is a form of toxic teasing.

A lot of people on the internet misuse the word gaslighting. This is a textbook case of it - you are warping her perception of reality because you find it 'cute.' This is actually abusive. Please seek help, your wife deserves better. No, you dressing it up in patronizing, and frankly paternalistic language doesn't make it better, you still suck.", "YTA. It's not a \"game\" if Kate's not a knowing or willing participant. It's not a \"joke\" if you're the only one laughing. And it doesn't matter how \"cute\" or \"adorable\" Kate is when looking for something, you don't hide people's stuff just to make them look for it.\n\nWhat you did is called **gaslighting**. It's a form of abuse where you try to convince people that their thoughts and/or memories are incorrect. How is this gaslighting? Let's review:\n\n1) You would take Kate's stuff, hide it from her, and pretend to have no idea where it is.\n\n2) You would then \"help\" her find it, despite knowing exactly where it is, **or** put it back in it's regular spot and pretend Kate had overlooked it, **despite knowing she didn't**.\n\nIt sounds like your sisters were right; you made Kate feel stupid and doubt herself, just because she was \"cute\" when looking for things. 2-3 times a week, for two years.\n\nYTA and I hope Kate leaves you.", "YTA. Do you have any idea how it feels to think you're losing your mind trying to find something when you thought you knew exactly where it was? Clearly not, because you're doing it on purpose to her.

We've been married almost 5 years. Kate is amazing and the cutest, sweetest person ever. I adore her! Kate is especially cute when she's looking for something and can't find it, walking around with her nose scrunched and talking to herself out loud, sometimes asking the lost object where it's hiding.\n\nAbout 2 years ago just to watch Kate be adorable looking for stuff, I started randomly hiding or moving things. (Not all the time, maybe 2-3 times a week.) Her keys, purse, pen, phone, etc... And every time Kate scrunched her face, talks to herself, and asks the object where it is and why it's hiding from her. I always help her find it after a few minutes or put it back in it's regular spot and say we must have overlooked it. Kate is always happy to find what she's looking for and I get to enjoy my wife being the adorably quirky person she is.\n\nI was hanging out with my sisters recently, they're both older than me, mid-30s and they both love Kate. We were talking and I told them what I'd been doing and they both blew up at me calling me an asshole and bad husband. They said Kate probably feels like she's losing her mind and forgetful, and feels really guilty over something I'm causing. I tried telling them there was no harm, Kate doesn't know it's me, but if she says its negatively impacting her I'll stop. I love Kate, I'd never hurt her.\n\nMy oldest sister ended up calling Kate while I was driving home and told her what I'd told my sisters. Kate went off on me, she's never done that before, saying I've been making her feel like she's and idiot and doubting herself. She ended up going to her parent's and they called to yell at me too. I tried explaining I only do it because Kate is so darn adorable when she's a bit frazzled and it's only a little joke but they all refuse to listen to me. \n\nI don't feel like I did anything really bad, just having some fun that in the long run is pretty harmless.

You need to stop doing this right now and apologize.", "Your sister should have told your wife that when you were kids, you got the cutest look on your face after she (your sister) kicked you in the balls incredibly hard, so your wife should try it every week for a couple of years.\n\nAnd you'd deserve every one of them.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - if you wanted to play a game and see her nose scrunch up, why not hide little gifts or something sweet? Instead you put her in a stressed out state 2-3 times a week for 2 years? You know, the construct of sociopathy is on a spectrum. I suggest you get yourself checked out, bc it\u2019s so odd that you get enjoyment from this when there are so many other ways besides gaslighting her to get her \u201cnose scrunched up\u201d or have her look for something in her quirky way", "My grandmother had really bad Alzheimers, most everyone in my family is terrified we\u2019ll also develop it. I also have ADHD which causes me to have memory issues. \n\nIf my husband \u201cplayed this game\u201d with me I would probably be having constant panic attacks and melting down on the inside to the point of affecting my mental health. \n\nI know that pregnancy can fuck with your memory etc too so I imagine she wasn\u2019t taking it casually lately.", "At no point in his post does OP mention even considering how his wife thinks.

Totally agree that if this story is true, there\u2019s definitely some underlying issues with the OP.

It\u2019s full-on psychological torture.", "This is a very literal form of gaslighting. Actually making his wife question her perception - she left her keys in one spot, now they\u2019re not there, but later they are there.
