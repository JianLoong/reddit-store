You did cross a line contacting his job, even if his boss is your cousin; however it was out of love and caring. He got upset and yelled at you, you both apologized for your actions. \n\nI hope your husband is doing better.", "NAH. It can be frustrating when you're trying to manage a workload and someone steps in, but after a seizure, you definitely did the right thing, especially when his boss is family. You acted in his best interests, and he's probably just lashing out because he's stressed.", "NAH - Your husband is correct for worrying about inappropriately contacting his boss, but in this situation, you were doing what you thought was the correct thing and trying to take care of something it looked like he needed to have taken care of.  This is something where having rules in place ahead of time makes sense.", "Perhaps another approach would be \"hey, I noticed you're getting a lot of chat messages, would it be okay if I let your cousin know what's going on?\"\n\nPeople at work may or may not know what's going on and he may not want to provide the level of information you may have provided.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA, you messaged your cousin who works with your husband not an unknown CEO. In the future, I\u2019d ask first before messaging but SOMEONE had to tell his supervisor he was unable to work otherwise he\u2019d have more shit to deal with tomorrow.", "NTA - I would hope if something similar happened to me that my husband would speak with my supervisor. They'd be worried sick if I disappeared in the middle of the day.", "YTA\n\nYes, you should've asked him first if that was something he wanted you to do for him. He may not have been comfortable sharing certain details with your cousin, or just in general wanted to contact them about it on his own terms. Medical issues are very personal, so it wasn't your place to take this upon yourself without permission. There could also very well be an added layer of discomfort here for him, due to his boss being family. Although you didn't mean to do anything inappropriate, it's about impact over intent.", "YTA, unfortunately. \n\nYou had good intentions, but he wasn't in a coma, and you could have asked.", "No matter how well-intentioned you were, you shared medical information with people that he may not want to know his history.", "YTA You shouldn\u2019t have contacted his work place without his consent. It would have taken less than a minute to check with your husband whether he wanted to contact them himself or whether he\u2019d like you to contact them. Also, it looks like he\u2019s doing worse if his wife rather than he himself is contacting his superiors.", "YTA. He was coherent and able to communicate with you. You could have let him know about the messages and asked him if he wanted you to contact anyone when you returned seconds later with his glasses.", "YTA, if he was conscious and aware you could have discussed messaging his workplace (who, what, how to convey that info) or if it could wait. It sounds like it was a panicked moment and you were trying to take care of things, so it's understandable, but maybe make a plan for how best to handle it in the future. It's a privacy issue as well as an autonomy issue.", "YTA his job, his problem. If he wanted you to do something related to his work, he would have asked", "YTA, even if his boss is your cousin that doesn't make it cool to intervene without telling him anything.", "YTA.\nJust because his boss is your family member doesn't mean it's ok for you to share information without his permission.", "NTA, if I got sick during the day and my boss and colleagues couldn't get a hold of me then I'd want my other half to give someone a heads up", "NAH. You had good intentions. Now that you know, don't cross that line again.", "YTA - You disrespected his autonomy at work. You had good intent but really? You overreached and it feels overbearing.\n\nHe likely feels not in control of major things in his life (e.g., health, untimely seizures, the rebound, aspects of becoming a dad). This feeling sucks. Focus on returning any level of control back to him by asking questions. \"Hey babe, since you need to chill the rest of the day, how do you want to update your team?\"  Guide him but do not 'do' for him unless he asks you to.  Together you can reach goals but stop stripping him of his sense of being a contributing and productive person. \n\n\\*\\*He should file for FMLA if he meets qualifying requirements (e.g. length of employment). Lots of factual information is available online. As you may know, his epilepsy requires 'in the moment' changes to his work schedule and FMLA protects him from losing employment.  Some people delay FMLA cause their boss is great but this and other aspects can change quickly. Your life together deserves this peace of mind. Hope you don't mind this suggestion.", "Slight YTA, it wasn't your place to reach out and specifically it wasn't ok to disclose medical information to his employer without his consent. I know your heart was in the right place but disclosing information can affect his work opportunities in the future.", "YTA.  He asked you for his glasses, and instead you went and gave his *private medical information* to people without his knowledge or consent.  Considering the fact that he was not incapacitated at the time, he could/would have done so himself if that's how he wanted things handled.  What you did is an enormous violation of his privacy.", "NTA.   \n\n\nI don't understand the people saying you're the AH when you're trying to make sure that no one at your husband's job is left high and dry by his sudden disappearance. He wasn't in a position to notify his employers himself, ffs.   \n\n\nI suppose if his employers didn't know about his epileptic episodes, you may have crossed a boundary by stating why he wouldn't be available for the rest of the day to his supervisor. But it was still within the realm of NTA by telling his supervisor that your husband wouldn't be available for the rest of the day.", "NAH - you were trying to help and your husband was pretty out of it because of a seizure. You were right that having him simply disappear Into thin air like that would probably have caused a fair amount of static in his office. You tried to handle it as discreetly as you could rather than blasting it all over the companies communication site. Given his condition, and the fact that he works from home, this is probably something you should have worked out ahead of time, as a just in case. You did not mean any harm and were actually trying to take care of him, and he apologized for getting salty about it. I also work from home and I know that my husband would immediately contact my boss and let her know if I had an emergency. He knows exactly how to find her contact info on my cell phone, but she is also a very good friend and he knows it's okay to tell her whatever is going on.", "NTA - Normally contacting your partner's coworkers is a violation of privacy, however in this case it was your cousin and I'm assuming your cousin knows your partners situation and is also a family member so the privacy issues can get blurred a bit but I still think you are NTA. \n\nPerhaps next time mention the amount of emails and ask if it's okay to let your partners coworkers know. If it was me I'd want my partner to contact my coworkers but I'm lucky that I have really understanding coworkers and flexible boss.", "Very very gentle YTA\u2026I think you should have just asked your husband if he wants you to inform his work he\u2019s not feeling well, it\u2019s not like it would have taken a long time for you to do that. May be he would have done that himself or asked you to which would have been his choice.\n\n\nIf he was unconscious or unable to decide on his own that ob do what you have done but it was too premature in this scenario. \nYou did have good intentions so hopefully you husband understands this and you guys move on and learn from that experience as to how you guys behave the next time something like this happens", "I was going to say definitely Y T A but since his boss is your cousin, that muddies the water a little, and I can why you thought it would be okay. But it wasn't. YTA (but only a little since the work/personal boundaries are already blurred).", "YTA. If it hadn't been for the connection with your cousin I don't think you'd ever reach out to his company because you would know you would be crossing a boundary. Unless he asks you to or is completely indisposed, you should not be in contact with his job.", "NAH He overreacted at bit, probably because of the seizure. You talked it out and that's it", "YTA. If he was unconscious, you\u2019d be fine. If you had said, \u201chey you have a bunch of missed messages, do you want me to contact them?\u201d you\u2019d be fine. But this is his job and his decision to make.", "A very, very soft YTA. I know you did what you did out of concern and love, but it would have been better for you to speak to him first. I would have been very upset if I were him. I know you had good intentions but you really did step out of line.", "Soft YTA. I get you had good intentions, but Kyle is right here and I understand why he\u2019s upset. He never gave you permission to do that and this wasn\u2019t really an urgent emergency where it was necessary for you to do that. He wasn\u2019t in the hospital or incapacitated.

Epilepsy is covered by the ADA if the company has 15 or more employees. You can also get FMLA for it as well. Did they previously know about his epilepsy or did you disclose it to them without his having told them?\nAlso, since it is a recent diagnosis for epilepsy, I imagine both of you are still getting used to it. Seizures can cause people to be more emotional and upset. I always have to warn/remind my wife after a seizure when I am feeling upset and irritable so she won't worry about me or think I'm upset with her. It doesn't necessarily excuse his reaction since ultimately he is responsible.\nI have epilepsy and at one point it was well controlled. After a breakthrough seizure, I was unable to go to work. I hadn't told them about my epilepsy yet inpart because I was still a new hire. Even though I am ADA protected. I would have preferred to make it past my probationary employee time before telling them. I would have liked it better if she had told them I was in the bathroom sick if it was necessary to call out sick and I could have addressed it myself later. However, she was scared because I was having a seizure and just called and told them and I found out once the post-ictal phase ended.\nWe didn't have an argument, even though I was not happy with how everything turned out, and part of why I was upset was worry over my job. Being ADA protected doesn't mean much especially as a new hire. I was mad about the loss of control. Not at her.", "I see literally every option here except for ESH, so that's what I'm voting for!\n\nNo, seriously, I'm not just being contradictory. OP, this is perhaps the gentlest ESH in history, but neither of you were at your best in this situation. You should have asked his permission before contacting his work, but he shouldn't have yelled at you for it. It sounds like both of you have apologized and neither of you had any malicious intent; you were just in a very stressful situation together and you both made mistakes. Both of you were technically wrong in this situation, but honestly I don't think either of you suck outside of it.", "YTA. He is your husband, not your kid. You contacted his employer, not his teacher. He is conscious, not unconscious. If you were concerned, you should've brought it up to him and expressed your concerns. That is communication.  I'd be mortified and embarrassed if someone contacted my employer on my behalf without my permission.", "YTA. If he was conscious you could have asked. I would be incandescently pissed if someone did this to me. How infantalizing.", "Agreed. Contacting a spouse/partner's job for them is pretty much only acceptable when the person is literally physically incapable of doing so themselves.  And this was *almost* that but not quite. \n\nI see a lot of people saying the cousin angle muddies the waters, but not really. In this context, he was still OP's husband's *boss* first and foremost. \n\nSaying \"hey do you want me to let cousin know\" or \"I notice you've been getting a lot of work messages, do you want me to send any kind of notice, just let me know what you want to say and I'll type it for you\" or anything like that would have been much better. But it's understandable, and given the context i don't think this impacted his reputation at work or anything like that. \n\nBut it sounds like it was a very stressful situation all around. Husband yelled when he shouldn't have and apologized. OP now has a better idea of what she should/shouldn't do if this ever happens again.", "ESH.  This is nothing to yell at his wife over.", "People treat you different when they know that you have seizures. Maybe he didn't want his bosses know, especially that he had one while working.  Now bosses may second guess him, not give him promotions as fast, ect.\n\nEpilepsy is scary for some people, they start acting like your some lil delicate thing, question you if your able to do certain things.\n\nAfter you come out of a seizure your memory is shot. Your head is throbbing, and you have NO strength. Most times  you bite your tongue and that is painful.  One minute everything if cool and life is good the next, you feel like you just got hit by a bus. Don't take anything he says right after a seizure personal, all his brains aren't back in order yet.\n\nYou shouldn't have mentioned anything about seizures, just said that he had an emergency and will contact you later.", "There is a lot of stigma that still comes along with epilepsy and other seizure disorders. This was crossing a huge line not only because you shared his medical info, you shared medical info that is particularly sensitive and can be used to call his capacity to do certain things into question. Massive YTA.", "Soft YTA- he was awake and talking, you should have just told him he had messages and asked if he\u2019d like you to send a message back for him. Also even if you did have to send a message for him, plenty of people don\u2019t want others to know about their medical conditions even if it is his cousin. You shouldn\u2019t be airing your husband\u2018s medical conditions out to people without his permission. You absolutely had good intent, but it\u2019s very possible he didn\u2019t want people to know that he was having seizures.", "Yta. His bosses might be related to you but you just messed with his job. If he wanted work to know about the epilepsy he would have told them himself. You completely over stepped your boundaries. He could have explained later he wasn\u2019t feeling well and maybe gotten a doctors note. You don\u2019t know the work dynamics you might have cost him future projects or promotions if they don\u2019t think he could get the work done.", "Gentle YTA\n\nYou were doing this out of a place of love, but this did cross a few boundaries. You should have checked with your husband first before contacting his boss in the first place. Telling your cousin the specifics was not necessary, you should have just said \u201cminor medical emergency\u201d and kept it at that. \n\nAlso, depending on your husbands job, you having clear access to his messaging program could get him in trouble with his companies security rules. In many lines of work, the work an employee is doing is confidential and not to be seen by others, even spouses, even though it undoubtedly happens in every day life. However, thinking a spouse may see an employees computer screen is a lot different than getting confirmation that they have not only seen the screen, but that the computer has been left unlocked quite a bit of time after the employee left the computer, very often violates company rules. If I was to ever go into the office, my computer screen is supposed to lock after 1 minute of inactivity to make sure others can\u2019t access my computer if I had to walk away unexpectedly. \n\nIf this happens again, you need to ask your husband for his permission to contact his bosses and then do it via a phone call or text message, not through the company equipment that only your husband should have access to.", "YTA\n\nFirstly I know you did this because you had good intentions, but good intentions aren't always the right actions. \n\nFirstly, your husband. He has gone through a life change and it isn't easy when you're trying to adapt to something like this. He may only have a seizure once every so often, but he already has to rely on you and others around him to keep him safe. This is a level of vulnerability a lot of people will never have to consider/deal with - it also can have an impact on a person's independence in the sense they will feel like they're losing some of it. (I have seizures as well so I'm talking from experience).\n\nYour husband is trying to deal with a new normal all the while trying to keep some normalcy in his life. \n\nWhat you did is not only break a boundary by reading his phone. But you acted for him as if he is incapable of doing so himself, and you did so behind his back. You acted as if you were his mother, not his partner. \n\nJust because he now has seizures every so often doesn't mean you can/should make decisions for him. \n\nAnd let's be real, 50 messages isn't really a lot. I have a group chat with 3 friends, and two of us at any point can send over 100 messages in a conversation in the space of 20 mins or less.", "YTA. It is absolutely not your place to contact his work, even if it\u2019s your relatives. It would have taken about 30 seconds to say \u201chey, I noticed all the messages, can I call them for you?\u201d\n\nYou should never ever share someone else\u2019s medical information without their permission. He was RIGHT THERE- it\u2019s not like he was unconscious or unavailable. There was absolutely no reason you couldn\u2019t have spoken to him first. The fact that people think  this is okay is blowing my mind.", "YTA... you contacted his bosses without his permission, and I'd be irate that you shared medical information with them.  He was alert and coherent, a quick ask if he wanted you to would of sufficed let alone sharing the mediclal reason why. Heck, around our area, it is really frowned upon to share any medical info without written permission, even if it is a family member.", "Light YTA\n\nIt would have been better to ask first. You could have said something like:\n\n\"Hey honey. When I was getting your glasses, I noticed you had a bunch of work messages. Would you like me to let someone from work know what happened with you so they don't get too worried?\"", "YTA because you only apologized for the sake if peace,  not because you accept what you did was wrong. And what you did was wrong. Unless he is incapacitated then you do NOT interfere with his work.", "YTA. Your intentions were good but he was conscious and you should have let him know before you sent the message or just asked him if he wanted to do it instead.", "YTA \n\nYou had no business contacting his work without asking, even if it was your cousin. I know you had good intentions, but it could backfire on him. People here are saying epilepsy is covered under the ADA, but the ADA is only worth so much. He may be afraid of being illegally discriminated against or just not want your cousin and his coworkers to know his medical status.", "Soft YTA\n\nmy husband has epilepsy and while I get your intentions were good, it does not really help.\n\nEpilepsy makes my husband feel like he has lost a lot of autonomy, he feels like he can't control a huge part of himself and his life.     Others do treat him differently, so to go over his head would be infantalising him in front of people who already have a perception of him. \n\nI can completely understand why your husband would be upset, maybe he shouldn't have yelled....but epilepsy and AEDs do weird things to your mood.", "YTA \n\nOnly because you said he had seizures.

It doesn't matter that your cousin is one of his bosses. They're HIS boss and it's his right to tell them in his own way and his own time, and his right to choose how much to tell. You trampled all over his rights. Now he's made it clear how he feels about it so don't cross it again.", "YTA", "NAH I don't think either of you are wrong in your feelings here.

Folks with brain injuries, though conscious, may not have full awareness of their environment, their own capabilities or have enough awareness to make informed/sound decisions.

Without an explanation, going AWOL while you are supposed to be working is probably not something a boss will appreciate.\n\nYour SO's reaction shows his fear of his own condition, his weakness and his lack of faculties. He struck out in fear and rage at his own limitations. He knows he should have been the one to act but he failed. You covering for him brings home his embarrassment. His frustrations will boil over from time to time but he needs to learn not not take it out on others. \n\nI suggest you get counseling together with someone that understands epilepsy and the ongoing issues that are unlikely to diminish.

You were taking care of your ill spouse and you didn't want him to worry about work or work to worry about him. He... probably didn't want the office to know he was having a seizure.

It\u2019s not like you messaged back on his work computer.", "NTA! Reporting a medical emergency like this is when it's actually okay to contact a partner's employer!\n\nAlso, after having a seizure people take a bit of time before they're entirely able to think and act coherently as normal (Postictal phase). I had to press my housemate with epilepsy to go to the hospital after a big seizure. Like OP's husband, she too fell in the bathroom and I was incredibly worried she had hit her head. The seizure also lasted much much longer than her \"normal\" epileptic seizures. She definitely needed to be checked out, but she had it stuck in her head that she didn't want to go to the hospital. When she got back she thanked me, but it was terrifying at the time.\n\nI would bet that's why Kyle apologized later, once he recovered more. He knew OP did the right thing, especially by reaching out to a coworker who was also a trusted family member. OP wasn't contacting a complete stranger but someone who already knew her and likely was aware of the situation and could take it from there.\n\nETA: I do feel a little bad about calling someone in the Postictal phase an AH. However, based on my experience, the person was being an AH but with a medical explanation.", "NTA, he could've been fired for disappearing in the middle of the day.", "NTA. You were trying to help while he was out of it after a seizure.

I disagree with these responses saying you shouldn\u2019t have contacted his job. With the messages piling up, you did what any decent person would do in that situation and explained that a medical situation was occurring. \nKyle overreacted when he should be commending your caring as a wife.", "NTA I do not think you did anything wrong in this situation. You only called your cousin and no one else. You were worried about him and with all of his e-mail messages you were concerned about his job.", "Nta", "Nta. You did what you thought was right. Imagine what his bosses were thinking with all the unanswered emails.", "NTA but seriously, 50 missed messages?

I totally get you had the best intentions at heart, but I also get the sense of intrusion your husband felt regarding contacting his job. My job is my way of providing for myself and loved ones, and I\u2019d prefer if someone check with me first before contacting them and speaking for me.

Also, as someone who has a loved one who deals with seizures and epilepsy, if at all possible, PLEASE press his doctors to improve his medication, as epilepsy is a progressive disease and the more seizures he has, the more likely he'll have even more, and the risk of him dying from seizures (SUDEP) increases. If SUDEP happens, there's really no way to save his life in that moment, so you really have to work on preventative measures to keep that from happening. The goal should be getting him seizure free. That may sound impossible, but I have acquaintances who have epilepsy but have been seizure free for a fair few years now. So that's the ideal!

I know it\u2019s not a rational feeling, we all have issues of some sort that occasionally put us out of order, but the idea that our worth is determined by our ability to produce is just engrained in us so deeply.

You did what you thought was the right thing to do and I would have done the same. You were just trying to help. \n\nIntent matters.

I believe any other reason would be crossing a line, but he had a seizure and maybe people were looking for him.", "NTH. I usually lurk but don\u2019t comment. As a person with seizures, I understand where he is coming from.

It takes a good couple of hours to feel ok. Not fine, OK! I feel like a train ran over me, have a killer headache and lose awareness of my surroundings. Not to mention, STRESS exacerbates our seizures. If he\u2019s anything like me and doesn\u2019t want his seizures to define him and his work ethic.

My husband has had several health related issues lately... he's a dentist.  On many occasions I've had to step in, where I normally wouldn't, due to necessity in handling things at the office for him.  I'm not a dentist but I can help with general office needs.

I have epilepsy, I\u2019m rarely thinking totally right after a seizure, it\u2019s very stressful and exhausting.

If my bf messaged my boss after one, I\u2019d be grateful after clearing my head that he wanted to make sure my job was secure and I was not worrying about work", "NTA I think part of his frustration is from added stress due to to work/deadlines. I\u2019m sure if he was in the zone he was frustrated/stressed that he now didn\u2019t feel well enough to finish what he was working on. He\u2019s also probably frustrated because he doesn\u2019t want his superiors to think he is weaker/can\u2019t meet important deadlines - not that they would at all but if I was in his shoes I\u2019d probably worry about that. \n\nWhile you probably should\u2019ve asked or said \u201cyou\u2019re getting a lot of messages can I text my cousin and tell them what happened?\u201d I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole at all.

IDK how many of you have worked in a labor environment and not been able to reach an integral co-worker, but it can fuck up an entire day. You did the best you could do with the information you had, and now you have a reason to  discuss what he wants to happen in the future. Maybe it's not what he wanted, but he never expressed that to you and honestly that's on him.", "NTA. Just compassionate and courteous.", "NAH. You were trying to look out for him. It would\u2019ve probably been a better move to say something like \u201cHey, I noticed you\u2019re getting a bunch of messages. I\u2019m gonna text my cousin and just let him know what\u2019s going on so they don\u2019t think you went MIA.\u201d That gives him the chance to tell you not to or give you the go-ahead and everything\u2019s fine.

You stop trusting your own body. Especially if meds aren't working, it's hell all the time. And as a person who had her first tonic clonic at work, the level of embarrassment is so intense. Everyone treats you like you've traumatized them. And like you're made of glass. And you have to worry about public seizures all the time. You feel so dependent. I say all this because NTA but his post ictal self and his regular self are both extremely overwhelmed. I can't imagine being diagnosed with this after an accident.

I do think it was a mistake because your husband was not so incapacitated he could not call out sick himself, or suffer the consequences for failing to do so.

Scary shit!\n\nAfter a tonic-clonic seizure, the brain needs to recover. This is called the Postictal Period. This can include confusion, exhaustion, and full body soreness. Oftentimes, there is memory loss (neither my dad or my daughter ever remembered anything about the seizure).  Also very common are feelings of sadness or embarrassment. And sometimes people may become irrational or combative (that could explain your husband\u2019s anger). \n\nAll of that is a long way of saying you did the right thing. You assessed the situation and made a good call. For what it\u2019s worth, if he\u2019s on meds and still having tonic-clonic seizures, he should talk to his neurologist about trying a stronger dose or a tweaked combination of meds. Seizures take a lot out of a person. \n\nNTA. You did the right thing.", "NAH. The one instance that a spouse contacting a job is the standard is to inform the job of a medical issue when the spouse isn't capable of doing it themselves.

This is stressful for everyone. Make a plan now with your husband about what he\u2019d like you to do if anything similar happens again. Like how long to wait, who you should contact, etc. And he should also communicate this with the colleagues or leaders of his choice.", "Nta. You didn\u2019t contact his job you told your cousin who works with him. It\u2019s not like you called the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. You told a relative privately keeping it discreet. This seems like something deeper for him. He needs therapy.", "NTA, he was out of commission and any workplace would be right to worry if he went MIA. Does his work have your number in case of emergency? You two need to come up with a plan for this because ignoring it could affect his job standing, his life and your family\u2019s security.  \n\nAlso, Sometimes people can be moody and \u201coff\u201d directly after a seizure. It\u2019s possible he apologized because he meant it, not just keep the peace.", "NAH. The lines are probably a bit blurry with the boss/cousin thing. But really, your husband was conscious and able to speak for himself, you should have asked his permission first or let him know he should contact his work. If he was in a coma then go for it. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t give you any more grief for doing this though, you meant well and it\u2019s very minor in the grand scheme of things.", "My SO has had epilepsy since she was 8 also from a accident, my father in law had a severe brain injury about 4 years ago. \n\n\nEpilepsy can and is scary and can be difficult for both parties. I'm not sure what your husbands condition is or what medication he takes. \n\nMy SO took several meds for several different types of epilepsy, she unfortunately had to be taken off her meds completely and our neurologist actually recommended medical marijuana. She has been taking the gummies first thing in the morning and maybe once during the day and before bed. The gummies absolutely work for her. And if she starts to show signs of having a a seizure she will smoke and its instantaneous.  this works for her, it may not for you.  just thought for food. \n\n\nNow my father in law had an accident where he fell from an 11 foot trailer at his work and landed straight on the back of his head. At first he was pretty normal but about 2 and a half years later he became neurotic and honestly pretty mean. The doctors warned us that it might be the case but we never expected it to get nearly as bad as it was. My folks lived in a different state at the time and around 2 am one night my mother called me scared and hiding inside her kicked car in the floorboard so he wouldn't find her. He had tried to drown her with a water bottle? And he had pulled a gun out on her. \n\nHe was a very nice and genuine person. He was always thoughtful and never used bad language. \n\nI'm not telling you any of this to scare you or worry you. There's a large chance none of this will even happen. \n\nI told you about my SO's epilepsy and the shift in medicine because that's what worked for us and honestly it's worked far better than any medication she's ever been on. It's quick and much cheaper too. But it might not work or be available for everyone. \n\n\nI mentioned my father in law because we just assumed he would recover and we wouldn't have any issues, we were very wrong. \n\nAlways remember to keep track of dates and times of all of your seizures and report them you your doctor. This will come in very VERY handy later if you guys ever decide to go for disability. \n\nKeep a journal of his moods and any odd behavior or changes from his typical self. Report these to your doctor as well. \n\nWe used to try to just walk in and tell them X thing happened around Z time but we were never as clear and consice as we were until we started keeping track of everything. It helps the doctors see any new trends or any worsening trends.

You were looking out for his best interests and you even talked to his cousin rather than calling into work. At least he came to his senses and apologized to you for being a dick. He needs to check his shit and admit he overreacted over your looking out for him. I don't blame you for not wanting to reach out again.

Unlike many other medical issues (eg a headache, physical injury, infectious illness) an individual in a post-ictal state (recently post-seizure) often does not have the capacity to make those decisions on their own accord. In a post-ictal state, your executive function and even sensory processing can be compromised (eg not being able to comprehend language, being in a \u201cfog\u201d, being mute/non-interactive, having amnesia, emotional dysregulation etc). You found yourself in a situation where you had to make a quick decision on your husband\u2019s behalf, and you acted in what you felt was his best interest with the limited information available to you. It was all in good faith. \n\nMoving forward, were the situation to ever arise again, you know how your husband would want things handled and shouldn\u2019t overstep.

You're also a bit of an AH for disclosing specific medical information - that is your husband's information to disclose if he so wishes.\n\nIn theory, the correct move for you should have been go back into the other room, let your husband know that you saw 50 missed messages while getting his glasses and remind him to contact his boss so they know he'll be out the rest of the day or ask him if he would like you to contact them for him if he isn't up to it.  So, I get why he's upset, although I think the severity of his upset was maybe a little more than the situation called for given that he had a seizure and was missing work.  I know my boss would be looking for me if I suddenly wasn't available.  So while I might ordinarily side with him fully...I've seen helicopter spouses posting here wondering if they were the AH for contacting their partner's boss over their PTO or their annual performance review, so in comparison I think this ranks way below that as long as there isn't a next time cause I'm feeling generous today.", "YTA. You did not have any business sharing his PRIVATE medical information with anyone, even your cousin. You should have asked him if he wanted you to do anything.

His job is not your place to intervene.", "YTA, but I understand why you did it. Jobs require selective sharing of information and you can very easily blow any covers he may have set up. This was a serious boundary cross. You also have to remember, while something like 50 missed calls could impact your employment status, it isn't true for everyone. I really wanted my husband to cooperate with his bad manager, my background is admin where keeping the boss happy is job 1, but the dude was making a power play to make my husband work on Christmas for no reason and I was wrong.

Just you doing that will remind him, if he\u2019s distracted just after a seizure, and then he can take care of the communication that needs to happen.", "YTA- this is a same day situation. Had he ended up hospitalized and missed a day it is understandable. But you and he were obviously already communicating, and you overstepped. I do think Asshole is too strong a word here, but this isnt a NAH to me, you clearly overstepped and I would be upset if I were him as well.

U didn't  do anything majorly wrong but it is best to let spouses handle that kind of info. Now if it were something where he was in surgery (emergency) and he was on his way to work or if he is actively unconscious for more than say 30 to 90 minutes then I could see u letting them know. My son will be out for hours after one. But ur hubby was working at home so probably just let him handle though now is a good time to discuss what if.  My son tripped while we were walking and triggered one when he hit his head. At first we thought no biggie but then he got really bad over the next 24 hours and required hospitalization for a week, with meds and several eegs because his CT and mri was showing normal but the eeg was abnormal.  Apparently if the seizures are triggered in the lower part of the brain stem opposed to the brain due to pressure/swelling u will only see it in an eeg.

You did what any suppose would do, and, realistically, if he was insurance or doing it himself, you would have to.

If his seizures aren\u2019t under great control with meds, it might be a good time for him to look into intermittent FMLA or even an ADA accommodation if he hasn\u2019t already done so.\n\nYou did overstep\u2014but if he\u2019d needed to go to the ER or be admitted to the hospital, of course he might not have been able to make the notification himself.  So there are times when you would need to.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already experienced this when he had his accident.\n\nWishing you both the very best.", "NTA- \n\nno show no call is the no.1 reason people get fired.  your husband isn't thinking straight.  if i couldn't make it to work, i would really hope a loved one would explain why if i wasn't in a condition to tell them myself.  if your husband thinks he can keep using \"epilepsy\" as an excuse if he goes no show no call, it will be his own damned fault when his bosses fire him.\n\neveryone in management knows this is true.  there is a point where your medical excuses stop excusing bad conduct like no call no show.  when i had covid and was on my death bed, i still let work know EVERY DAY hours before my shift i couldn't come in, and when i couldn't send the message i had someone else send it.  My boss was so appreciative she gave me full pay for the 3 weeks i missed even though my sick/vacation time only covered half of that time.  \n\nyou have a responsibility as an employee to keep your boss in the loop if you can't work.  he couldn't work, he couldn't tell his boss, and he vanished in the middle of the day.  you are saving his job by telling his boss, and you have nothing to apologize for.  shame he doesn't appreciate it.  i wish i had someone like that in my life.", "Why not go the husband and let him know about the messages?", "This. The job understands if you don\u2019t reply right away lol. The job is not as important", "Being upset after a seizure is actually a sign that lucidity hasn\u2019t returned. After a seizure, we\u2019re much, much more prone to being upset about things without making any rational emotional connections to what\u2019s happening. The brain is still trying to sort itself out after the electrical storm, and it makes makes lots of fleeting, mistaken connections.", "I have never been treated worse at work, with an employer that prides itself on being progressive about equality, after disclosing that I'd acquired a disability.", "Meanwhile, I\u2019ve recently started having seizures that leave me low-functioning for a good bit, and I very much rely on my husband to inform my clients when I\u2019ve had one. If he didn\u2019t, I\u2019d just seem to be randomly leaving my clients in a lurch without any information. I\u2019ve never had a job where it would be better to just get to them whenever I could post-seizure, rather than to have them informed of my temporary incapacitation.", "NAH but in the future I'd go with \"had a medical event\" or some such.\n\nMy husband ended up in the hospital and lost his phone. He asked me to call his work. Which I did. And when they asked I said \"I'm not comfortable sharing his medical information without his permission\". They asked expected return time (day/s, week/s, etc) which was totally fair cause they need to plan for staff. So I answered that honestly.", "I hope you didn't use his work system to message your cousin because that defiantly would have been a bad idea and could be viewed as quite serious depending on your husbands job. NAH though I can see both angles.", "I dunno. Not a big deal I wouldn\u2019t have thought given that you\u2019re put in the position of having to deal with a person having a seizure and being post-ictal for however long. On the other hand employers can be dicks about this kind of thing so he probably wanted to keep it under the radar a bit. No-one\u2019s in the wrong IMO, it was just one of those situations.", "NAH\n\nYou've both apologised, so I'm not sure what issue remains?\n\nThat said, I'm giving your husband the benefit of the doubt, because he'd just had a seizure, and maybe was still a bit off balance.  Have you spoken about this since?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>His thinking is that it wasn\u2019t my place to message his supervisor   \nbecause he never told me that it was something I could do for him.\n\nIs that still his \"thinking\"?  If so, it appears that epilepsy wasn't the only result of his head injury.  Maybe explain to him that he's being a jerk, and that he needs to try to moderate his impulses", "YTA\n\nIf my wife were to access the data on my work computer I could get fired. I am assuming that you messaged this person from his work computer.\n\nI guess it depends on the field of work, but I have access to really sensitive information and work for a company that takes data security very seriously. \n\nYou should have checked with your husband before doing that. \n\nIt's also likely very embarrassing for him. He likely feels out of control of his own body. You making, even small decisions for him like this takes control away from him. Even if you were just trying to help. \n\nThis could also effect his reputation within the company. It's not supposed to, but it definitely can and too often does. \n\nIf there is a promotion he is up for and there is a close call between him and another virtually identical candidate then remembering that one time he left the group hanging could make the difference. The reason being is that how you announce and spin these things in the corporate world is important. \n\nShould it be? No. In reality though, things aren't always what they should be. \n\nI would apologize to him and work out a plan for what to do if this happens again. \n\nIf nothing else so that he can feel like he is in control of his own life, body, and job.", "I\u2019m on team NAH. You may have crossed a boundary, but you did it out of love and a very valid concern that he was not in a safe mindset to contact his workplace, and while it really wasn\u2019t clear if he was capable of contacting his job safely/appropriately. He yelled and snapped, but he did it while in the post-ictal phase of a seizure in which emotional regulation is significantly impaired, and he apologized later. \n\nI\u2019ll also echo some other commenters mentioning that this is actually still a pretty high rate of seizures and I hope he\u2019s working with his doctor on a plan to try to reduce them, and isn\u2019t just accepting this as his \u201cnormal.\u201d I knew someone with epilepsy and their doctor was still very concerned when they were having seizures every 6-12 months, the goal was to be essentially seizure free.", "NAH - you contacted a relative who happens to be a supervisor. I think if you'd taken it upon yourself to contact his superior sight unseen then I think that would have been a little different. Lines get blurred when work also features friends and family. I get why he's a little tetchy about it. If work's snowballing he no doubt thinks he's letting people down.", "NAH, I get migraines that can range from worst pain I've ever experienced to it hurts but I just need to chill. When I have my off the scale migraine my bf texted me out and gave me medicine. I'm always grateful when he does so because I can't focus and it any light is too much.", "NAH, you did your best to help, maybe it wasn't what he wanted, you both apologized after.\n\nA lot of people are saying he wouldn't be coherent enough after a seizure, but I do think you should have asked him before doing this. He didn't even say you should have never done it, just that you didn't tell him in advance. Your options were do nothing, and he might get in trouble for just disappearing from work, or let them know. I think it might have helped to ask, 'hey would you like me to notify my cousin that you'll be gone the rest of the day?' Most likely it wouldn't have been an issue at all then, because it wouldn't feel like he had no control over it. \n\nStill, since it is indeed always hard to deal with these things when someone is facing the after-effects of a seizure, maybe have a proper conversation about it at a later time to figure out what he would like you to do in these cases. If he's out completely, do you notify someone? If he's alert but probably not fully coherent, do you ask him so you can notify someone, or let him deal with it later?", "NAH", "NTA\n\nThey already knew everything and all and you just let your cousin know this is totally normal, I was gonna give n a h tbh but idk lol", "I\u2019m gonna go with NAH.\n\nI don\u2019t think it was necessarily wrong to contact your cousin, and it was probably the best way to talk to someone at the company regarding your husbands state at the time. As for your husband, if my wife reached out to someone at my work, I would probably be somewhat upset. I can imagine he\u2019s embarrassed or ashamed(even though he should not be) that he couldn\u2019t get important work done because of his seizure. It sucks he yelled at you, but I can imagine he\u2019s pretty stressed and overwhelmed.\n\nYou and your husband made up, apologized, and I\u2019m sure he realized you did it out of love and concern.", "Not necessarily the A, but in the future I\u2019d just either get his permission or nudge him to do it.", "NAH..... I don't think you crossed a boundary, personally. If I had a migraine so bad that I couldn't even properly function or that I had to go to the E.R, I wouldn't bat an eye at my husband letting my work know. Would you get upset with your husband if - knock on wood - you had a pregnancy complication and couldn't work?", "I say NTA.\nContacting a spouse's job/employer while the said spouse is undisposed or unable to do it themselves is a no brainer, and shouldn't be a brainer.\nIt can give relief for the employer from worrying what's going on if the worker cannot be contacted suddenly while on call.", "NAH. I would take this as an opportunity to put a plan in place for the future. What would he like you to do if this happens again?", "Even if what you just said was correct, broad strokes isn\u2019t \u201cHe had a seizure.\u201d Broad strokes would look like, \u201cI had an emergency and got pulled away.\u201d Again, not her job to decide how/when/what to share.", "It is not a Golden rule actually. I have different preferences than my husband, different views on work dynamic, family dynamic, ect. What I would do for myself is very different than what he would do for himself in many situations. So \"I would want Him to do it for Me\" does not apply. It's more like \"He would want me to do it for him\".", "He was t the the state of mind to do so it that would hav been the first thing he did after he decided he wasn\u2019t working the rest of the day. Think about it. People who have seizures aren\u2019t in the proper state of mind for hours after having one. I had a friend with epilepsy", "You really don\u2019t know anything about seizures. You are disoriented after having one for some people for hours. I had a friend who had epilepsy I\u2019ve seen first hand a few times what happens after a seizure.", "Aggressive behavior before and after seizures is actually a known symptom of epilepsy", "\"The Golden Rule\" is \"Treat others as you would like to be treated\".\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule", "No I know seizure and what to expect after since I had a friend with epilepsy and I also studied them in college. Like I said he need to talk to his neurologist."]}
