You did cross a line contacting his job, even if his boss is your cousin; however it was out of love and caring. He got upset and yelled at you, you both apologized for your actions. \n\nI hope your husband is doing better.", "NAH. It can be frustrating when you're trying to manage a workload and someone steps in, but after a seizure, you definitely did the right thing, especially when his boss is family. You acted in his best interests, and he's probably just lashing out because he's stressed.", "NAH - Your husband is correct for worrying about inappropriately contacting his boss, but in this situation, you were doing what you thought was the correct thing and trying to take care of something it looked like he needed to have taken care of.  This is something where having rules in place ahead of time makes sense.", "Perhaps another approach would be \"hey, I noticed you're getting a lot of chat messages, would it be okay if I let your cousin know what's going on?\"\n\nPeople at work may or may not know what's going on and he may not want to provide the level of information you may have provided.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA, you messaged your cousin who works with your husband not an unknown CEO. In the future, I\u2019d ask first before messaging but SOMEONE had to tell his supervisor he was unable to work otherwise he\u2019d have more shit to deal with tomorrow.", "NTA - I would hope if something similar happened to me that my husband would speak with my supervisor. They'd be worried sick if I disappeared in the middle of the day.", "YTA\n\nYes, you should've asked him first if that was something he wanted you to do for him. He may not have been comfortable sharing certain details with your cousin, or just in general wanted to contact them about it on his own terms. Medical issues are very personal, so it wasn't your place to take this upon yourself without permission. There could also very well be an added layer of discomfort here for him, due to his boss being family. Although you didn't mean to do anything inappropriate, it's about impact over intent.", "YTA, unfortunately. \n\nYou had good intentions, but he wasn't in a coma, and you could have asked.", "No matter how well-intentioned you were, you shared medical information with people that he may not want to know his history.", "YTA You shouldn\u2019t have contacted his work place without his consent. It would have taken less than a minute to check with your husband whether he wanted to contact them himself or whether he\u2019d like you to contact them. Also, it looks like he\u2019s doing worse if his wife rather than he himself is contacting his superiors.", "YTA. He was coherent and able to communicate with you. You could have let him know about the messages and asked him if he wanted you to contact anyone when you returned seconds later with his glasses.", "YTA, if he was conscious and aware you could have discussed messaging his workplace (who, what, how to convey that info) or if it could wait. It sounds like it was a panicked moment and you were trying to take care of things, so it's understandable, but maybe make a plan for how best to handle it in the future. It's a privacy issue as well as an autonomy issue.", "YTA his job, his problem. If he wanted you to do something related to his work, he would have asked", "YTA, even if his boss is your cousin that doesn't make it cool to intervene without telling him anything.", "YTA.\nJust because his boss is your family member doesn't mean it's ok for you to share information without his permission.", "NTA, if I got sick during the day and my boss and colleagues couldn't get a hold of me then I'd want my other half to give someone a heads up", "NAH. You had good intentions. Now that you know, don't cross that line again.", "YTA - You disrespected his autonomy at work. You had good intent but really? You overreached and it feels overbearing.\n\nHe likely feels not in control of major things in his life (e.g., health, untimely seizures, the rebound, aspects of becoming a dad). This feeling sucks. Focus on returning any level of control back to him by asking questions. \"Hey babe, since you need to chill the rest of the day, how do you want to update your team?\"  Guide him but do not 'do' for him unless he asks you to.  Together you can reach goals but stop stripping him of his sense of being a contributing and productive person. \n\n\\*\\*He should file for FMLA if he meets qualifying requirements (e.g. length of employment). Lots of factual information is available online. As you may know, his epilepsy requires 'in the moment' changes to his work schedule and FMLA protects him from losing employment.  Some people delay FMLA cause their boss is great but this and other aspects can change quickly. Your life together deserves this peace of mind. Hope you don't mind this suggestion.", "Slight YTA, it wasn't your place to reach out and specifically it wasn't ok to disclose medical information to his employer without his consent. I know your heart was in the right place but disclosing information can affect his work opportunities in the future.", "YTA.  He asked you for his glasses, and instead you went and gave his *private medical information* to people without his knowledge or consent.  Considering the fact that he was not incapacitated at the time, he could/would have done so himself if that's how he wanted things handled.  What you did is an enormous violation of his privacy.", "NTA.   \n\n\nI don't understand the people saying you're the AH when you're trying to make sure that no one at your husband's job is left high and dry by his sudden disappearance. He wasn't in a position to notify his employers himself, ffs.   \n\n\nI suppose if his employers didn't know about his epileptic episodes, you may have crossed a boundary by stating why he wouldn't be available for the rest of the day to his supervisor. But it was still within the realm of NTA by telling his supervisor that your husband wouldn't be available for the rest of the day.", "NAH - you were trying to help and your husband was pretty out of it because of a seizure. You were right that having him simply disappear Into thin air like that would probably have caused a fair amount of static in his office. You tried to handle it as discreetly as you could rather than blasting it all over the companies communication site. Given his condition, and the fact that he works from home, this is probably something you should have worked out ahead of time, as a just in case. You did not mean any harm and were actually trying to take care of him, and he apologized for getting salty about it. I also work from home and I know that my husband would immediately contact my boss and let her know if I had an emergency. He knows exactly how to find her contact info on my cell phone, but she is also a very good friend and he knows it's okay to tell her whatever is going on.", "NTA - Normally contacting your partner's coworkers is a violation of privacy, however in this case it was your cousin and I'm assuming your cousin knows your partners situation and is also a family member so the privacy issues can get blurred a bit but I still think you are NTA. \n\nPerhaps next time mention the amount of emails and ask if it's okay to let your partners coworkers know. If it was me I'd want my partner to contact my coworkers but I'm lucky that I have really understanding coworkers and flexible boss.", "Very very gentle YTA\u2026I think you should have just asked your husband if he wants you to inform his work he\u2019s not feeling well, it\u2019s not like it would have taken a long time for you to do that. May be he would have done that himself or asked you to which would have been his choice.\n\n\nIf he was unconscious or unable to decide on his own that ob do what you have done but it was too premature in this scenario. \nYou did have good intentions so hopefully you husband understands this and you guys move on and learn from that experience as to how you guys behave the next time something like this happens", "I was going to say definitely Y T A but since his boss is your cousin, that muddies the water a little, and I can why you thought it would be okay. But it wasn't. YTA (but only a little since the work/personal boundaries are already blurred).", "YTA. If it hadn't been for the connection with your cousin I don't think you'd ever reach out to his company because you would know you would be crossing a boundary. Unless he asks you to or is completely indisposed, you should not be in contact with his job.", "NAH He overreacted at bit, probably because of the seizure. You talked it out and that's it", "YTA. If he was unconscious, you\u2019d be fine. If you had said, \u201chey you have a bunch of missed messages, do you want me to contact them?\u201d you\u2019d be fine. But this is his job and his decision to make.", "A very, very soft YTA. I know you did what you did out of concern and love, but it would have been better for you to speak to him first. I would have been very upset if I were him. I know you had good intentions but you really did step out of line.", "Soft YTA. I get you had good intentions, but Kyle is right here and I understand why he\u2019s upset. He never gave you permission to do that and this wasn\u2019t really an urgent emergency where it was necessary for you to do that. He wasn\u2019t in the hospital or incapacitated.

Epilepsy is covered by the ADA if the company has 15 or more employees. You can also get FMLA for it as well. Did they previously know about his epilepsy or did you disclose it to them without his having told them?\nAlso, since it is a recent diagnosis for epilepsy, I imagine both of you are still getting used to it. Seizures can cause people to be more emotional and upset. I always have to warn/remind my wife after a seizure when I am feeling upset and irritable so she won't worry about me or think I'm upset with her. It doesn't necessarily excuse his reaction since ultimately he is responsible.\nI have epilepsy and at one point it was well controlled. After a breakthrough seizure, I was unable to go to work. I hadn't told them about my epilepsy yet inpart because I was still a new hire. Even though I am ADA protected. I would have preferred to make it past my probationary employee time before telling them. I would have liked it better if she had told them I was in the bathroom sick if it was necessary to call out sick and I could have addressed it myself later. However, she was scared because I was having a seizure and just called and told them and I found out once the post-ictal phase ended.\nWe didn't have an argument, even though I was not happy with how everything turned out, and part of why I was upset was worry over my job. Being ADA protected doesn't mean much especially as a new hire. I was mad about the loss of control. Not at her.", "I see literally every option here except for ESH, so that's what I'm voting for!\n\nNo, seriously, I'm not just being contradictory. OP, this is perhaps the gentlest ESH in history, but neither of you were at your best in this situation. You should have asked his permission before contacting his work, but he shouldn't have yelled at you for it. It sounds like both of you have apologized and neither of you had any malicious intent; you were just in a very stressful situation together and you both made mistakes. Both of you were technically wrong in this situation, but honestly I don't think either of you suck outside of it.", "YTA. He is your husband, not your kid. You contacted his employer, not his teacher. He is conscious, not unconscious. If you were concerned, you should've brought it up to him and expressed your concerns. That is communication.  I'd be mortified and embarrassed if someone contacted my employer on my behalf without my permission.", "YTA. If he was conscious you could have asked. I would be incandescently pissed if someone did this to me. How infantalizing.", "Agreed. Contacting a spouse/partner's job for them is pretty much only acceptable when the person is literally physically incapable of doing so themselves.  And this was *almost* that but not quite. \n\nI see a lot of people saying the cousin angle muddies the waters, but not really. In this context, he was still OP's husband's *boss* first and foremost. \n\nSaying \"hey do you want me to let cousin know\" or \"I notice you've been getting a lot of work messages, do you want me to send any kind of notice, just let me know what you want to say and I'll type it for you\" or anything like that would have been much better. But it's understandable, and given the context i don't think this impacted his reputation at work or anything like that. \n\nBut it sounds like it was a very stressful situation all around. Husband yelled when he shouldn't have and apologized. OP now has a better idea of what she should/shouldn't do if this ever happens again.", "ESH.  This is nothing to yell at his wife over.", "People treat you different when they know that you have seizures. Maybe he didn't want his bosses know, especially that he had one while working.  Now bosses may second guess him, not give him promotions as fast, ect.\n\nEpilepsy is scary for some people, they start acting like your some lil delicate thing, question you if your able to do certain things.\n\nAfter you come out of a seizure your memory is shot. Your head is throbbing, and you have NO strength. Most times  you bite your tongue and that is painful.  One minute everything if cool and life is good the next, you feel like you just got hit by a bus. Don't take anything he says right after a seizure personal, all his brains aren't back in order yet.\n\nYou shouldn't have mentioned anything about seizures, just said that he had an emergency and will contact you later.", "There is a lot of stigma that still comes along with epilepsy and other seizure disorders. This was crossing a huge line not only because you shared his medical info, you shared medical info that is particularly sensitive and can be used to call his capacity to do certain things into question. Massive YTA.", "Soft YTA- he was awake and talking, you should have just told him he had messages and asked if he\u2019d like you to send a message back for him. Also even if you did have to send a message for him, plenty of people don\u2019t want others to know about their medical conditions even if it is his cousin. You shouldn\u2019t be airing your husband\u2018s medical conditions out to people without his permission. You absolutely had good intent, but it\u2019s very possible he didn\u2019t want people to know that he was having seizures.", "Yta. His bosses might be related to you but you just messed with his job. If he wanted work to know about the epilepsy he would have told them himself. You completely over stepped your boundaries. He could have explained later he wasn\u2019t feeling well and maybe gotten a doctors note. You don\u2019t know the work dynamics you might have cost him future projects or promotions if they don\u2019t think he could get the work done.", "Gentle YTA\n\nYou were doing this out of a place of love, but this did cross a few boundaries. You should have checked with your husband first before contacting his boss in the first place. Telling your cousin the specifics was not necessary, you should have just said \u201cminor medical emergency\u201d and kept it at that. \n\nAlso, depending on your husbands job, you having clear access to his messaging program could get him in trouble with his companies security rules. In many lines of work, the work an employee is doing is confidential and not to be seen by others, even spouses, even though it undoubtedly happens in every day life. However, thinking a spouse may see an employees computer screen is a lot different than getting confirmation that they have not only seen the screen, but that the computer has been left unlocked quite a bit of time after the employee left the computer, very often violates company rules. If I was to ever go into the office, my computer screen is supposed to lock after 1 minute of inactivity to make sure others can\u2019t access my computer if I had to walk away unexpectedly. \n\nIf this happens again, you need to ask your husband for his permission to contact his bosses and then do it via a phone call or text message, not through the company equipment that only your husband should have access to.", "YTA\n\nFirstly I know you did this because you had good intentions, but good intentions aren't always the right actions. \n\nFirstly, your husband. He has gone through a life change and it isn't easy when you're trying to adapt to something like this. He may only have a seizure once every so often, but he already has to rely on you and others around him to keep him safe. This is a level of vulnerability a lot of people will never have to consider/deal with - it also can have an impact on a person's independence in the sense they will feel like they're losing some of it. (I have seizures as well so I'm talking from experience).\n\nYour husband is trying to deal with a new normal all the while trying to keep some normalcy in his life. \n\nWhat you did is not only break a boundary by reading his phone. But you acted for him as if he is incapable of doing so himself, and you did so behind his back. You acted as if you were his mother, not his partner. \n\nJust because he now has seizures every so often doesn't mean you can/should make decisions for him. \n\nAnd let's be real, 50 messages isn't really a lot. I have a group chat with 3 friends, and two of us at any point can send over 100 messages in a conversation in the space of 20 mins or less.", "YTA. It is absolutely not your place to contact his work, even if it\u2019s your relatives. It would have taken about 30 seconds to say \u201chey, I noticed all the messages, can I call them for you?\u201d\n\nYou should never ever share someone else\u2019s medical information without their permission. He was RIGHT THERE- it\u2019s not like he was unconscious or unavailable. There was absolutely no reason you couldn\u2019t have spoken to him first. The fact that people think  this is okay is blowing my mind.", "YTA... you contacted his bosses without his permission, and I'd be irate that you shared medical information with them.  He was alert and coherent, a quick ask if he wanted you to would of sufficed let alone sharing the mediclal reason why. Heck, around our area, it is really frowned upon to share any medical info without written permission, even if it is a family member.", "Light YTA\n\nIt would have been better to ask first. You could have said something like:\n\n\"Hey honey. When I was getting your glasses, I noticed you had a bunch of work messages. Would you like me to let someone from work know what happened with you so they don't get too worried?\"", "YTA because you only apologized for the sake if peace,  not because you accept what you did was wrong. And what you did was wrong. Unless he is incapacitated then you do NOT interfere with his work.", "YTA. Your intentions were good but he was conscious and you should have let him know before you sent the message or just asked him if he wanted to do it instead.", "YTA \n\nYou had no business contacting his work without asking, even if it was your cousin. I know you had good intentions, but it could backfire on him. People here are saying epilepsy is covered under the ADA, but the ADA is only worth so much. He may be afraid of being illegally discriminated against or just not want your cousin and his coworkers to know his medical status.", "Soft YTA\n\nmy husband has epilepsy and while I get your intentions were good, it does not really help.\n\nEpilepsy makes my husband feel like he has lost a lot of autonomy, he feels like he can't control a huge part of himself and his life.     Others do treat him differently, so to go over his head would be infantalising him in front of people who already have a perception of him. \n\nI can completely understand why your husband would be upset, maybe he shouldn't have yelled....but epilepsy and AEDs do weird things to your mood.", "YTA \n\nOnly because you said he had seizures.

It doesn't matter that your cousin is one of his bosses. They're HIS boss and it's his right to tell them in his own way and his own time, and his right to choose how much to tell. You trampled all over his rights. Now he's made it clear how he feels about it so don't cross it again.", "YTA", "NAH I don't think either of you are wrong in your feelings here.

Folks with brain injuries, though conscious, may not have full awareness of their environment, their own capabilities or have enough awareness to make informed/sound decisions.

Without an explanation, going AWOL while you are supposed to be working is probably not something a boss will appreciate.\n\nYour SO's reaction shows his fear of his own condition, his weakness and his lack of faculties. He struck out in fear and rage at his own limitations. He knows he should have been the one to act but he failed. You covering for him brings home his embarrassment. His frustrations will boil over from time to time but he needs to learn not not take it out on others. \n\nI suggest you get counseling together with someone that understands epilepsy and the ongoing issues that are unlikely to diminish.

You were taking care of your ill spouse and you didn't want him to worry about work or work to worry about him. He... probably didn't want the office to know he was having a seizure.

Reporting a medical emergency like this is when it's actually okay to contact a partner's employer!\n\nAlso, after having a seizure people take a bit of time before they're entirely able to think and act coherently as normal (Postictal phase). I had to press my housemate with epilepsy to go to the hospital after a big seizure. Like OP's husband, she too fell in the bathroom and I was incredibly worried she had hit her head. The seizure also lasted much much longer than her \"normal\" epileptic seizures. She definitely needed to be checked out, but she had it stuck in her head that she didn't want to go to the hospital. When she got back she thanked me, but it was terrifying at the time.\n\nI would bet that's why Kyle apologized later, once he recovered more. He knew OP did the right thing, especially by reaching out to a coworker who was also a trusted family member. OP wasn't contacting a complete stranger but someone who already knew her and likely was aware of the situation and could take it from there.\n\nETA: I do feel a little bad about calling someone in the Postictal phase an AH. However, based on my experience, the person was being an AH but with a medical explanation.", "NTA, he could've been fired for disappearing in the middle of the day.", "NTA. You were trying to help while he was out of it after a seizure. You\u2019re probably his emergency contact anyways, if he went the whole day without responding people likely would\u2019ve reached out to you either way.", "NTA. I disagree with these responses saying you shouldn\u2019t have contacted his job. With the messages piling up, you did what any decent person would do in that situation and explained that a medical situation was occurring. \nKyle overreacted when he should be commending your caring as a wife.", "NTA I do not think you did anything wrong in this situation. You only called your cousin and no one else. You were worried about him and with all of his e-mail messages you were concerned about his job.", "Nta", "Nta. You did what you thought was right. Imagine what his bosses were thinking with all the unanswered emails.", "NTA but seriously, 50 missed messages? His cousin is his boss is probably what is saving his job\u2026 if I miss even one message from my boss, I hear about it. He\u2019s lucky.", "NTA. You did the right thing, and depending on the size of his employer, there would be protocols in place for these kind of situations that would require someone to notify them. \n\nDepending on where you live, his employer is responsible for his safety even if he's working from home (this is the case where I live).", "Soft YTA. I totally get you had the best intentions at heart, but I also get the sense of intrusion your husband felt regarding contacting his job. My job is my way of providing for myself and loved ones, and I\u2019d prefer if someone check with me first before contacting them and speaking for me. I was going to say ESH because the yelling was a little too far, but in all fairness, he did apologize. It was a simple miscommunication, but unless it was a life and death situation, a simple ask would suffice.", "I have adult onset epilepsy. Your husband is going through the post-ictal phase that affects his mood and emotional regulation, whether he recognizes it or not.  For me, the effects last for days up to a week. I only grew aware of it as time passed on (it's been about four years now). \n\n\nI'm gonna go with NTA.", "NAH. Also, as someone who has a loved one who deals with seizures and epilepsy, if at all possible, PLEASE press his doctors to improve his medication, as epilepsy is a progressive disease and the more seizures he has, the more likely he'll have even more, and the risk of him dying from seizures (SUDEP) increases. If SUDEP happens, there's really no way to save his life in that moment, so you really have to work on preventative measures to keep that from happening. The goal should be getting him seizure free. That may sound impossible, but I have acquaintances who have epilepsy but have been seizure free for a fair few years now. So that's the ideal! Honestly you probably already know all this, so hopefully this comment is useless! But in case you don't know, I hope this comment helps.", "This isn't really a AH situation. You had nothing but good intentions.", "YTA, even though you meant well, it wasn't your place to interfere with his career. If he wanted your help, he would have asked.\n\nI hope he's feeling better.", "NAH", "NTA. You're in a no win position.  \nIf you don't contact someone at his work, then hes done as well.  \nGoing forward, he needs to arrange for someone to contact for you.  \nI've worked afterhours and we have an escalation chain, this chain is usually also the people workers are supposed to contact and your man needs to let you know how that is.  \nYou did the right thing.", "YTA. HE works for your cousin, not you. You are too comfortable with his workplace, apparently, and you overstepped. I'm guessing you wouldn't have messaged his superior if they weren't your cousin, so what makes it okay now?", "NTA and I don\u2019t think you crossed a line, decisions sometimes have to be made for your spouse when they aren\u2019t able to make them. We can\u2019t always do it exactly how they want, we just try to do the best we can as partners. You took care of him and thought you were doing the right thing.", "NAH.", "I think this depends on a couple of things. \n\nDoes his work know about the seizures?\n\nDid they know you were at home with him?\n\nIf, they know, then you didn't disclose anything. \n\nIf they know, and thought there was a chance he'd had a seizure while alone in the house then they had every reason to be concerned that he'd just dropped off the call. \n\nI think, given the # of people who work from home now, it's reasonable that they could worry if someone just stops responding and they might have phoned emergency services. \n\nIt might be an idea to set up a plan with your husband for this situation going forward, but I'd say NAH", "NTA. I was understanding, but still annoyed with my husband for NOT telling people I was in the hospital. I was technically alert but in the ICU and not really thinking straight.\n\nYour husband isn't wrong for wanting you to ask, but he should cut you some slack.", "NTA you are his wife and the next of kin of corse it\u2019s your job to let his work known that he can\u2019t work. No call no show is how you get fired.", "Slight YTA. Just ask your husband first. He wasn\u2019t unconscious and he would be able to tell you who to inform and how.", "NAH If he was awake and aware I would have said \u201chey your Teams is blowing up do you feel okay to message your boss or should I send something and say you\u2019ll check in later.  \u201c", "She is the asshole for telling them he was having seizures. \n\nShe should have simply said \u201che won\u2019t be back in\u201d", "I really think this is a YTA situation. It doesn\u2019t have to be a harsh AH determination, but he was literally lying in the other room. He had just asked her to grab his glasses. She could have asked him how he wanted to proceed.\n\nHe\u2019s dealing with a stressful situation that he has zero control over and then she takes away his control of how to address this professionally. He was right to be upset.", "Dude it\u2019s literally the wife\u2019s job as the next of kin to notify the job if the husband can\u2019t make it to work.", "To be honest, I dont get this perspective. She's not an ASSHOLE asshole, just a little, tiny, baby asshole to me. She's talking about a medical problem that he obviously seemed pretty upset about them knowing. You can say family is family, but it's not only family here. It's his work. Not cool at all. Why give specifics? Why not just throw out something vague? \n \nA small yta to OP. Don't tell anyone your husband's sensitive info without asking if it's okay.", "I didn't use the messaging program, I texted my cousin's personal cell phone.", "She never said if he was coherent\u2026. People are generally confused after a seizure and can be for a while after. And he fell down and may have gotten a head injury/concussion.", "People are generally confused after a seizure and can be for an hour or more. It\u2019s called a post ictal phase. Not to mention he fell down and may have gotten a head injury/concussion as well. I see post ictal and post concussive people in the ER all the time. They aren\u2019t all there and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to communicate and they don\u2019t think straight.", "This. He was awake and alert. A quick, do you want me to tell cousin you're ill?  Would have made everything fine as you would have had an answer to if he wanted or needed that.\n\nYTA", "Yup YTA", "Seems kind of presumptuous to say its his own fear.\nMy husband does not fear his epilepsy, he does fear being treated like he can't do things by those who don't understand his condition. \nHe is very picky about who he tells the medical details to,  having his wife do it for him would cement that he needs someone to \"look after him\".", "Yup, the Postictal seizure state can be tough because they're not fully back to normal even though the seizure technically ended. And it's why OP's husband apologized later because he realized she did do the right thing (contacting a family member who worked with husband to handle the situation).\n\nI do hope OP and her husband put together a plan of what to do in the future. I had a similar situation where I had to force my epileptic housemate to go to the hospital after a minutes-long grand mal seizure with possible head injury. We worked out with her family and partner how to proceed if such a situation arises in the future, including getting paperwork in order.", "Exactly. The Postictal Phase (after the seizure) still isn't back to normal cognitive functioning. It's why OP's husband apologized later.", "yeah, basically wants me to not handle his work communications unless he either asks me to or he is physically incapable of contacting them.", "Also.. Hope he\u2019s doing better.", "in further thought\u2026 i would say you\u2019re not an AH, but you may have crossed the line by specifying that he had a seizure. I would have kept that confidential. but i still think you acted out of care in wanting his boss to know that he was alright, just had an emergency.\nThough, if his boss already knew that he had epilepsy- most likely as his boss is basically family - I see no problem whatsoever in your actions.", "This is the correct answer. They needed to know; they didn't need to know that much.", "Yes actually she did. He was coherent enough to get upset by her actions which would be plenty coherent to ask him a question. Stop making excuses for peoples bad decisions.", "People are generally confused after a seizure and can be for an hour or more. It\u2019s called a post ictal phase. Not to mention he fell down and may have gotten a head injury/concussion as well. I see post ictal and post concussive people in the ER all the time. They aren\u2019t all there and sometimes it\u2019s difficult to communicate and they don\u2019t think straight.", "Normally I'd agree, but I think it's a big assumption that they don't already know. If he's going into the office sometimes, they'd absolutely need to be aware of the seizures, both for liability reasons and to make sure no one does anything stupid if he has a seizure at the workplace. And, even if he's full-time work from home, I'd be worried about having a seizure during a work meeting/call and causing panic.", "Exactly. Like don\u2019t ring my boss and say \u201cOP is having heavy periods and doesn\u2019t feel up for it\u201d. Be simple. Don\u2019t explain", "I have epilepsy. I would be so angry if someone called my work on my behalf.", "Which had she described that to be the case I would agree with you but he seemed plenty coherent enough to be upset by her decision meaning he understood the parameters and the decision well enough to vocalize his negative feelings about it to her. Has she said I tried asking him but he was so disoriented I went ahead and texted my cousin and now he's mad that would be completely understandable and no fault should fall on her. \n\nIt's that there was no ask no consideration that he may not want to share that private health information with his place of work or that he may have a particular supervisor who is aware of the issue he is more comfortable reaching out to or just the desire to handle it himself. It's the removal of his choice that is the problem if he is unable to make a choice then she hasn't removed his decision but no matter what she should have asked before taking that choice from him. \n\nAll that said it came from a good place which makes it hard to be mad at OP but at the end of the day she should have asked and she didn't which is why it's a soft YTA from me.", "In the UK you don't actually need to disclose it unless you want reasonable adjustments.", "That's arguably true here too, but I don't feel like it would fly with epilepsy that's resistant to management and could hypothetically cause someone to fall and hit their head--and not everyone knows what to do when someone is having a seizure. They could call 911 (which costs an OBSCENE amount of money here in the US of A) unnecessarily or do something that causes more harm.", "That\u2019s really dumb and dangerous.\n\nAustralia you need to declare so, if it happens, your coworkers and employers know what to do and don\u2019t think you\u2019re dying", "Very true, I didn't think about the cost side of things. People here don't really think that way, workplaces can be kind of callous and as long as they are covered to not be sued, they don't care.\n\" he never told us, so we aren't liable\"", "You shouldn\u2019t be airing your husband\u2018s medical conditions out to people without his permission. You absolutely had good intent, but it\u2019s very possible he didn\u2019t want people to know that he was having seizures."]}
