He probably has a seizure once every three months, even with medication.

At one point, he asked me to get his glasses from his office, which I did.\u00a0\n\nWhile getting his glasses, I noticed that he had 50+\u00a0new messages from various supervisors and coworkers, I didn\u2019t read any of them but when I noticed how many messages were popping there were, I messaged my cousin (one of his bosses) privately and said that while he is fine now, Kyle\u00a0just\u00a0had a\u00a0seizure and he\u2019s probably not going to be available for the rest of the day. My cousin was understanding and said not to worry about it.\u00a0\n\nWhen I told Kyle that I messaged my cousin he was upset with me because he didn\u2019t think it was okay for me to\u00a0message them without telling him first. He yelled at me for crossing a boundary (something he later apologized for).\n\nHis thinking is that it wasn\u2019t my place to message his supervisor because he never told me that it was something I could do for him. My thinking was that I didn\u2019t want his coworkers to think that he just went MIA for no reason, or that something was seriously wrong with him, but I can see how this might have been overbearing.\u00a0\n\nI apologized to\u00a0Kyle already for the sake of making peace, and I won\u2019t reach out to anyone on his\u00a0behalf again.

You did cross a line contacting his job, even if his boss is your cousin; however it was out of love and caring. He got upset and yelled at you, you both apologized for your actions. \n\nI hope your husband is doing better.", "NAH. It can be frustrating when you're trying to manage a workload and someone steps in, but after a seizure, you definitely did the right thing, especially when his boss is family. You acted in his best interests, and he's probably just lashing out because he's stressed.", "NAH - Your husband is correct for worrying about inappropriately contacting his boss, but in this situation, you were doing what you thought was the correct thing and trying to take care of something it looked like he needed to have taken care of.  This is something where having rules in place ahead of time makes sense.", "Perhaps another approach would be \"hey, I noticed you're getting a lot of chat messages, would it be okay if I let your cousin know what's going on?\"\n\nPeople at work may or may not know what's going on and he may not want to provide the level of information you may have provided.", "I\u2019m leaning towards NTA, you messaged your cousin who works with your husband not an unknown CEO. In the future, I\u2019d ask first before messaging but SOMEONE had to tell his supervisor he was unable to work otherwise he\u2019d have more shit to deal with tomorrow.", "NTA - I would hope if something similar happened to me that my husband would speak with my supervisor. They'd be worried sick if I disappeared in the middle of the day.", "YTA\n\nYes, you should've asked him first if that was something he wanted you to do for him. He may not have been comfortable sharing certain details with your cousin, or just in general wanted to contact them about it on his own terms. Medical issues are very personal, so it wasn't your place to take this upon yourself without permission. There could also very well be an added layer of discomfort here for him, due to his boss being family. Although you didn't mean to do anything inappropriate, it's about impact over intent.", "YTA, unfortunately. \n\nYou had good intentions, but he wasn't in a coma, and you could have asked.", "No matter how well-intentioned you were, you shared medical information with people that he may not want to know his history.", "YTA You shouldn\u2019t have contacted his work place without his consent. It would have taken less than a minute to check with your husband whether he wanted to contact them himself or whether he\u2019d like you to contact them. Also, it looks like he\u2019s doing worse if his wife rather than he himself is contacting his superiors.", "YTA. He was coherent and able to communicate with you. You could have let him know about the messages and asked him if he wanted you to contact anyone when you returned seconds later with his glasses.", "YTA, if he was conscious and aware you could have discussed messaging his workplace (who, what, how to convey that info) or if it could wait. It sounds like it was a panicked moment and you were trying to take care of things, so it's understandable, but maybe make a plan for how best to handle it in the future. It's a privacy issue as well as an autonomy issue.", "YTA his job, his problem. If he wanted you to do something related to his work, he would have asked", "YTA, even if his boss is your cousin that doesn't make it cool to intervene without telling him anything.", "YTA.\nJust because his boss is your family member doesn't mean it's ok for you to share information without his permission.", "NTA, if I got sick during the day and my boss and colleagues couldn't get a hold of me then I'd want my other half to give someone a heads up", "NAH. You had good intentions. Now that you know, don't cross that line again.", "YTA - You disrespected his autonomy at work. You had good intent but really? You overreached and it feels overbearing.\n\nHe likely feels not in control of major things in his life (e.g., health, untimely seizures, the rebound, aspects of becoming a dad). This feeling sucks. Focus on returning any level of control back to him by asking questions. \"Hey babe, since you need to chill the rest of the day, how do you want to update your team?\"  Guide him but do not 'do' for him unless he asks you to.  Together you can reach goals but stop stripping him of his sense of being a contributing and productive person. \n\n\\*\\*He should file for FMLA if he meets qualifying requirements (e.g. length of employment). Lots of factual information is available online. As you may know, his epilepsy requires 'in the moment' changes to his work schedule and FMLA protects him from losing employment.  Some people delay FMLA cause their boss is great but this and other aspects can change quickly. Your life together deserves this peace of mind. Hope you don't mind this suggestion.", "Slight YTA, it wasn't your place to reach out and specifically it wasn't ok to disclose medical information to his employer without his consent. I know your heart was in the right place but disclosing information can affect his work opportunities in the future.", "YTA.  He asked you for his glasses, and instead you went and gave his *private medical information* to people without his knowledge or consent.  Considering the fact that he was not incapacitated at the time, he could/would have done so himself if that's how he wanted things handled.  What you did is an enormous violation of his privacy.", "NTA.   \n\n\nI don't understand the people saying you're the AH when you're trying to make sure that no one at your husband's job is left high and dry by his sudden disappearance. He wasn't in a position to notify his employers himself, ffs.   \n\n\nI suppose if his employers didn't know about his epileptic episodes, you may have crossed a boundary by stating why he wouldn't be available for the rest of the day to his supervisor. But it was still within the realm of NTA by telling his supervisor that your husband wouldn't be available for the rest of the day.", "NAH - you were trying to help and your husband was pretty out of it because of a seizure. You were right that having him simply disappear Into thin air like that would probably have caused a fair amount of static in his office. You tried to handle it as discreetly as you could rather than blasting it all over the companies communication site. Given his condition, and the fact that he works from home, this is probably something you should have worked out ahead of time, as a just in case. You did not mean any harm and were actually trying to take care of him, and he apologized for getting salty about it. I also work from home and I know that my husband would immediately contact my boss and let her know if I had an emergency. He knows exactly how to find her contact info on my cell phone, but she is also a very good friend and he knows it's okay to tell her whatever is going on.", "NTA - Normally contacting your partner's coworkers is a violation of privacy, however in this case it was your cousin and I'm assuming your cousin knows your partners situation and is also a family member so the privacy issues can get blurred a bit but I still think you are NTA. \n\nPerhaps next time mention the amount of emails and ask if it's okay to let your partners coworkers know. If it was me I'd want my partner to contact my coworkers but I'm lucky that I have really understanding coworkers and flexible boss.", "Very very gentle YTA\u2026I think you should have just asked your husband if he wants you to inform his work he\u2019s not feeling well, it\u2019s not like it would have taken a long time for you to do that. May be he would have done that himself or asked you to which would have been his choice.\n\n\nIf he was unconscious or unable to decide on his own that ob do what you have done but it was too premature in this scenario. \nYou did have good intentions so hopefully you husband understands this and you guys move on and learn from that experience as to how you guys behave the next time something like this happens", "I was going to say definitely Y T A but since his boss is your cousin, that muddies the water a little, and I can why you thought it would be okay. But it wasn't. YTA (but only a little since the work/personal boundaries are already blurred).", "YTA. If it hadn't been for the connection with your cousin I don't think you'd ever reach out to his company because you would know you would be crossing a boundary. Unless he asks you to or is completely indisposed, you should not be in contact with his job.", "NAH He overreacted at bit, probably because of the seizure. You talked it out and that's it", "YTA. If he was unconscious, you\u2019d be fine. If you had said, \u201chey you have a bunch of missed messages, do you want me to contact them?\u201d you\u2019d be fine. But this is his job and his decision to make.", "A very, very soft YTA. I know you did what you did out of concern and love, but it would have been better for you to speak to him first. I would have been very upset if I were him. I know you had good intentions but you really did step out of line.", "Soft YTA. I get you had good intentions, but Kyle is right here and I understand why he\u2019s upset. He never gave you permission to do that and this wasn\u2019t really an urgent emergency where it was necessary for you to do that. He wasn\u2019t in the hospital or incapacitated. It seems like this would have been an easy thing to ask Kyle about before you did it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Epilepsy is covered by the ADA if the company has 15 or more employees. You can also get FMLA for it as well. Did they previously know about his epilepsy or did you disclose it to them without his having told them?\nAlso, since it is a recent diagnosis for epilepsy, I imagine both of you are still getting used to it. Seizures can cause people to be more emotional and upset. I always have to warn/remind my wife after a seizure when I am feeling upset and irritable so she won't worry about me or think I'm upset with her. It doesn't necessarily excuse his reaction since ultimately he is responsible.\nI have epilepsy and at one point it was well controlled. After a breakthrough seizure, I was unable to go to work. I hadn't told them about my epilepsy yet inpart because I was still a new hire. Even though I am ADA protected. I would have preferred to make it past my probationary employee time before telling them. I would have liked it better if she had told them I was in the bathroom sick if it was necessary to call out sick and I could have addressed it myself later. However, she was scared because I was having a seizure and just called and told them and I found out once the post-ictal phase ended.\nWe didn't have an argument, even though I was not happy with how everything turned out, and part of why I was upset was worry over my job. Being ADA protected doesn't mean much especially as a new hire. I was mad about the loss of control. Not at her.", "I see literally every option here except for ESH, so that's what I'm voting for!\n\nNo, seriously, I'm not just being contradictory. OP, this is perhaps the gentlest ESH in history, but neither of you were at your best in this situation. You should have asked his permission before contacting his work, but he shouldn't have yelled at you for it. It sounds like both of you have apologized and neither of you had any malicious intent; you were just in a very stressful situation together and you both made mistakes. Both of you were technically wrong in this situation, but honestly I don't think either of you suck outside of it.", "YTA. He is your husband, not your kid. You contacted his employer, not his teacher. He is conscious, not unconscious. If you were concerned, you should've brought it up to him and expressed your concerns. That is communication.  I'd be mortified and embarrassed if someone contacted my employer on my behalf without my permission.", "YTA. If he was conscious you could have asked. I would be incandescently pissed if someone did this to me. How infantalizing.", "Agreed. Contacting a spouse/partner's job for them is pretty much only acceptable when the person is literally physically incapable of doing so themselves.  And this was *almost* that but not quite. \n\nI see a lot of people saying the cousin angle muddies the waters, but not really. In this context, he was still OP's husband's *boss* first and foremost. \n\nSaying \"hey do you want me to let cousin know\" or \"I notice you've been getting a lot of work messages, do you want me to send any kind of notice, just let me know what you want to say and I'll type it for you\" or anything like that would have been much better. But it's understandable, and given the context i don't think this impacted his reputation at work or anything like that. \n\nBut it sounds like it was a very stressful situation all around. Husband yelled when he shouldn't have and apologized. OP now has a better idea of what she should/shouldn't do if this ever happens again.", "ESH.  This is nothing to yell at his wife over.", "People treat you different when they know that you have seizures. Maybe he didn't want his bosses know, especially that he had one while working.  Now bosses may second guess him, not give him promotions as fast, ect.\n\nEpilepsy is scary for some people, they start acting like your some lil delicate thing, question you if your able to do certain things.\n\nAfter you come out of a seizure your memory is shot. Your head is throbbing, and you have NO strength. Most times  you bite your tongue and that is painful.  One minute everything if cool and life is good the next, you feel like you just got hit by a bus. Don't take anything he says right after a seizure personal, all his brains aren't back in order yet.\n\nYou shouldn't have mentioned anything about seizures, just said that he had an emergency and will contact you later."]}
