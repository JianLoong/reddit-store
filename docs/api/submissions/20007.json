She decided to message her for the spot so she could get something done that she\u2019s been wanting for a while. I saw and thought, hey, that sounds great, I haven\u2019t gotten anything in a while, so I emailed my artist too. When I told her, she immediately got angry and said \u2018well /YOU/ can\u2019t get anything, that\u2019s irresponsible.\u2019\n\nFor context, she is getting a smaller piece on her arm and I\u2019m getting a sleeve that\u2019s been half finished on my arm completed. We both work full time, split bills evenly and make enough money to live comfortably even if just one of us was working, but she presented her reasoning to me and I\u2019m still trying to make sense of it:\n\n1. We need to save for the wedding. Fair, but this is coming off of a conversation we had only a few hours earlier with both of our parents on how they would pay for the majority of it. It\u2019s not going to be a very expensive one\u2026also, it\u2019s in October 2024. That\u2019s 16 months from now.\n\n2. I need a new car. There\u2019s literally nothing wrong with my car. I don\u2019t know where this came from. Hers is actively falling apart though, so\u2026\n\n3. My tattoo is more than hers. Also true, but I do have several thousand saved up already. This isn\u2019t a shared fund I\u2019m taking out of, it\u2019s my personal savings.\n\nShe said she would cancel her request to her artist if she replied, so I should do the same. It wasn\u2019t really a fight, mostly just her lecturing for about ten minutes before she walked off to let me finish my shift(we both work from home). To me this feels like she\u2019s either martyring herself or trying to guilt me out of it so I have no excuse to go, which is another thing because she also gives me grief for not going out much or having friends.\n\nWIBTA if I still got the tattoo?", "created_utc": 1687117183, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ct249/wibta_for_getting_a_tattoo_without_my_fianc\u00e9es/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It might be a good idea for you guys to lay out a savings plan for the wedding since she seems stressed. You definitely need to figure this out unless you want her micromanaging your spending habits over the next year until your wedding.", "NTA\n\nIn her eyes, you will be an AH, but objectively, you won't be. Either she has a weird relationship with money or she's low key controlling you. In both cases, this is something she needs to work on, and it is not your problem.", "NAH\n\nShe might have gotten upset at you but I think she just wants y\u2019all to have enough money saved up for y\u2019all\u2019s wedding and other expenses and might not be communicating in the best possible way. And considering how she offered to cancel her tattoo is also leading me to believe that she isn\u2019t trying to be rude but does care for y\u2019all\u2019s future financially.\n\nUnless you want to break off a whole engagement over this just don\u2019t get the tattoo. Obviously I don\u2019t know y\u2019all and I don\u2019t know your life but if this is a good relationship then it isn\u2019t worth losing over a tattoo.", "I think NTA right now but soft YWBTA if you got one anyway. Although she doesn\u2019t have any valid arguments to stop you from getting tatoos and she sounds like she\u2019s just being very unfair to you, I don\u2019t think doing it through conflict is the way to go if you plan on marriage. Communication on is super important imo, forcing your way through isn\u2019t really gonna bring any positivity. \n\nYou guys just quickly talked about it in the middle of your shift, maybe you should discuss about it more and share how you don\u2019t understand why she wants to stop you so bad that she\u2019d cancel hers. Surely if you have good savings the reason is not actually money but something else she maybe worries about to say such things. Wether she\u2019s right or wrong on the motives, trying to get your point across, listen to hers and find a compromise is something I would do. \n\nFrom what you wrote, I feel like she still feels anxious about the wedding money even if you guys just talked about it. Like letting parents pay isn\u2019t that acceptable or something. And maybe in her head her tatoo is okay but hers + yours is too much so to make it fair she\u2019ll cancel hers as well. It\u2019s probably silly thoughts that lead her to having this many concerns. Marriage make people stress and feel overwhelmed. \n\nYou know how she is better than a random Redditer tbh. I would just make sure her real reason is actually money and reassure her on that. Let her know that it\u2019s something that would make you happy and it wouldn\u2019t affect your situation in any way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Permission is not needed when it comes to spending your personal savings but great communication is important. It\u2019s good to have financial autonomy in a relationship. You\u2019ll need to practice this before you get married or things may get messy.", "YWNBTA because you are a grown adult in charge of your own body, not someone who is owned by your partner.  Since she was scheduling her own appointment this reeks of a control issue to me. Since your finances are completely separate then she really doesn't get a say in how you are spending your money either, that is on you as an autonomous adult. If you need to save for a wedding then you need to outline a budget, not off the cuff tell each other you can't do something in the name of the wedding arbitrarily. The giving you grief about not going out and not being super social starts to seem like a possible pattern of your partner critiquing your choices.  You might want to have a long think about what you want your future to look like.", "Nah , your body, your money, your choice.\n\nedited to add: she might really not like what you want to get... and.. she s afraid it might lessen the attraction, but thats her issue, still your body choice etc etc", "NTA but am wondering what next will you need her permission for?", "HI WE JUST TALKED ABOUT IT IT WENT AWFUL.\n\nI did my best to explain my POV outlined in the OP. Once again, no shouting or anything, just calm the whole time. She cried the whole time and said I\u2019m not contributing enough.\n\nI was like okay, clearly this isn\u2019t about  the tattoo, that\u2019s obvious. I can pay for more bills. Right now I pay half the rent, insurance, Internet, groceries. Do you want to make a budget?\n-No, it doesn\u2019t matter, things are just too expensive these days. Okay\u2026\n\nHer main point was that it was just too expensive to spend all at once and there could be some kind of emergency, regardless of whether the wedding is coming or not. She can recover from the several hundred of her tattoo, the $2k or so mine would cost is about a whole month\u2019s worth of paychecks. Fair point, but we have insurance on everything, and I\u2019m getting sick of how she treats me like an irresponsible teenager with my first job, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.\n\nTo me it\u2019s weird how for the first year of us living here, we were able to survive on just her working full time and me part time while I went to school. But now that I\u2019m working full time with her, we\u2019re suddenly broke.\n\n\nEverything I brought up she pretty much just shut me down, and it\u2019s gone beyond a stupid tattoo. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get it just because at this point it would be out of spite but she\u2019s acting really ridiculous.", "WTF? You are definitely NTA. You're an adult, and no one in the universe gets to tell you what to do with your own body or money. Big red flags here. I'd sit down after the ink is done and talk to her about it.

You only need the fiance's permission if it involves her body.", "Damn, you go hard.", "Haha yeah, \u2018permission\u2019 makes it sound a lot worse than it actually is.

It is a good relationship, we barely have any disagreements. I don\u2019t know what to do here because I think deep down she\u2019s trying to be thoughtful but it\u2019s coming off really controlling and hypocritical.", "Eh sounds like she's being controlling. \n\nThe wedding is a year a way and OP isn't using their shared money just her own. So it's not impacting the wedding fund. \n\nI would think this is more the fiance hoping OP buys her a new car.  Seeing that she mentioned Op needs a new car when OP car is fine but hers is on its last legs.", "Honestly, I'm glad your wedding is months away. Whether you get the tattoo or not this conversation should open up your eyes to many issues I'm your relationship. \n\nYou say you never fight but you also say she always treats you like a teenager regarding your job/money. Are you sure that you guys just don't fight because you give in? You're not gonna get the tattoo anymore cause of her disapproval, even though she did not make a good argument for why you shouldn't.\n\nJust be careful OP, people tend to keep their demons in until after marriage. If this is how controlling she is now, imagine how she will get after the wedding.", "This is how it will be for the rest of your life if you marry her. If she doesn't agree with your choices there will only be tears and guilt trips in your future. When people show you how they handle certain situations believe them. This isn't even her money that you are using. It is yours. Full stop. She should have 0 say in the matter. You have been saving this is your choice to make. It would be different if this was a joint account and you wanted to drop 2k but that is not the case. This has had vibes all over it.", "When people defile their holy temples \ud83e\udd2e that Christ gave them \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e", "I hope so, and my post was deliberately blunt to make a point. It\u2019s sometimes difficult to tell on Reddit if the OP\u2019s is being dramatic or if their partner isn\u2019t as bad as it reads.  I\u2019m glad for your case it\u2019s the latter. \n\nI\u2019d encourage you to take this as an opportunity for you and your fianc\u00e9 to talk about how your finances are to be combined after you\u2019re married.  I know that having that particular conversation would have been helpful in my own marriage - especially because my husband and I managed to start a couple of businesses after we married and ended up more wealthy than poor kids like us could have ever imagined.  It\u2019s been a weird ride, to say the least, and navigating this new world as \u201cwealthy\u201d people hasn\u2019t been without its challenges.  \n\nConsider keeping a personal account to save for tattoos and these sorts of personal purchases.  It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a tattoo or car parts or a fancy gaming computer, you should *always* have a little bit of personal savings, if for nothing else than to purchase gifts for your partner.  A Christmas or birthday present that you bought with combined funds isn\u2019t exactly the same as one that you\u2019ve saved up and sacrificed for, right?  We went through a period when we only had one combined account,  so birthday and Christmas presents were really just for our kids, and we ended up just buying each other things that we knew we each needed for the sake of having something wrapped under the tree.  Gifts felt less like \u201cpresents\u201d and just things purchased for the sake of it. \n\nWe eventually came up with the idea of what we call \u201cmad money\u201d. It\u2019s the money we set aside on in own accounts to spend on whatever we want and the other person CANNOT get mad about it.  If he wants to buy parts for one of his hot rods out of his \u201cmad money\u201d who am I to criticize?  If I want to buy a new eyeshadow pallet from Sephora even though I don\u2019t need it, what can he say?    It\u2019s our \u201cmad money\u201d.  Neither of us have the right to be mad about the purchase.  \n\nBut we also only spend our \u201cmad money\u201d on gifts for each other, so that the sacrifices we made to afford those gifts have meaning.  I had to save my own \u201cmad money\u201d for the wood-fired pizza oven I gave him today for Father\u2019s Day, and that makes it more meaningful than if I\u2019d have just charged it on our combined debit card.  \n\nBest of luck to you.  I\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t the   control freak she initially sounded like, and I wish you nothing but happiness and success in the future.", "Edited! My bad.", "Tell her that; if this is out of character for her then talk to her first before you do anything to see what's actually going on\n\nCould just be anxiety/being overwhelmed coming out weirdly but it was still an inappropriate way to talk to you", "If you're worried about the engagement falling apart over a tattoo there must be other things going on that you're either denying or not mentioning.\n\nYou say you have several thousand already saved up. Unless your tattoo will eat up all of your savings you have plenty of time until the actual wedding to make up any \"loss\" for a wedding you say isn't very expensive to begin with.\n\nYou don't need a new car, find out where her comment came from.", "I get it and I\u2019m not in a relationship so I wouldn\u2019t know but I think it would help if you talked to her about this. Not in an argument way like \u201cI want this tattoo\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re being so rude and controlling\u201d. But just ask her if she\u2019s worried about something. Considering how you\u2019re saying the wedding is in the distance and y\u2019all are doing okay financially she could be anxious about running out of money or having a situation where you don\u2019t have enough money for something. And she could be so anxious about this that she doesn\u2019t know how to communicate it properly without being upset at you and making up excuses. Does she have mental issues?", "I don't about that but there's way too much bad ink out there.  Way too much.  \n\nIt's passing rare that i ever see good art.  Then it's good for a year or three, then it's just a black mess of blehhh.", "I don\u2019t think it would fall apart or anything and it definitely wouldn\u2019t eat up all the savings, I just hate the idea of it becoming a big blowout fight. I haven\u2019t gotten a quote for a yet but I can\u2019t imagine it would be more than like, $2k. My dad is paying for my dress and her parents for hers and I\u2019m pretty sure the entire wedding in total won\u2019t be more than $10k in the end."]}
