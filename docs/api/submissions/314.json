Now I am sort of like my mothers 'alarm clock', I do not enjoy it (for those who might tell me to just stop waking her up, I can't I will get in trouble), each time waking her up is a hassle, I feel like I'm the adult waking up a child.\n\nBut today I was told by my sibling to wake her up at 8:30 cause she had to go do some important stuff today, so when that time inevitably rolled around, I went and got up to go wake her up. When she finally woke up, she had some back pain cause the mattress we currently use isn't really good, but she got mad at ME. \n\nI finally got fed up and told her that \"I'm not going to wake you up anymore.\" (Which is a lie, I'm going to get in trouble if it don't), she got mad at me for getting frustrated with her and finally got up to start stomping around the house.\n\nShe came into the living room and asked my younger sibling where her glasses were, I responded with \"I don't know\" because I thought she was talking to me, she got mad and snapped that she didn't want to talk to me. She kept making little remarks while I was crying under a cover, she didn't know this but I'm sure she wouldn't have cared, she's still mad at me and I don't know what to do, I accept any judgement given, but Aita for waking up my mom when I was told to?\n\n(for any yt channels or people who record themselves reading these to post online, please please please don't do this one at all, I don't want to get in even more trouble if it is found.)", "created_utc": 1667222013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yibsxx/aita_for_waking_up_my_mom_when_told_to/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which of your siblings told you to wake your mom as it should be them who she is annoyed with not you", "NTA. And you really need to stop being her alarm clock, she\u2019s a grown woman and that\u2019s not your responsibility as her child.", "NTA. You were just doing what your mom asked. It sounds like your mom is having a rough time but she shouldn't have taken it out on you.", "NTA\n\nI'll never understand grown adults that constantly need to be woken up by someone else and then get upset about it. Like really... how much of an adult are you if you can't even get yourself up...\n\noh and OP you shouldn't have to get her up but you shouldn't be treated like that when you do either. This is all on your mother for being wrong and maybe your sibling if they knew you'd get in trouble for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
