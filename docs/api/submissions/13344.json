My fianc\u00e9 was recently in a bad accident leaving him disabled. He was walking to work, hit by a truck, and we\u2019ve been slowly adjusting to new life. The accident damaged his cerebellum and brain stem making motor movements wonky and unbalanced for him. He is back at work but I think he is pushing himself too far.

Sure, sometimes that doesn't work out that way, but if this has happened 10 times, there is no way that 10 times after he was in the bath you then needed to use the restroom and couldn't hold it until he was done. \n\nLet me be clear again, that yes, you can control when you need to use the restroom. I assume you have gone on car rides that last an hour or longer, you go to the movies, you go in to meetings, and for the most part, you can gauge if you need to use the restroom before it begins, and can hold it if the feeling comes on during said activity. You do it everyday, but can't offer your fiance that basic level of respect. \n\nThis matters to your fiance, so you can decide that you don't care about him- this man that you say is so good to you- and that he is too sensitive and keep doing this to him, and probably not end up getting married because you lack a basic level of respect for him.

Plenty of us who can urinate and defecate in front of their partners also find this behavior offensive. Mostly because OP is not using the warning she is given to try and go ahead of time, in order to not disturb her partner\u2019s bath time. To me, urinating / defecating in front of your partner is so not the issue here. It\u2019s the inconsiderate nature of suddenly, consistently having to #2 while your partner is in the bath (which they\u2019ve told you is lowkey their sacred alone time, and been warned about in advance)\u2026 all the time.", "*At least*. 10 times that he wrote down, which implies it happened enough prior that he felt like he needed to record it to prove he wasn't exaggerating.", "It's one of the most literal interpretations of this emotional scenario (breaching one's boundaries and being treated like shit) that one can imagine", "Right like the edit was unnecessary\u2026 yes it sucks fianc\u00e9 was in an accident but even without that he deserved shit-free time to himself.\n\nYTA OP\u2026 big time\u2026 next time get a place with two bathrooms or go outside.", "Exactly.\n\nPeople tend to look at the symptom and not the deeper issue it reveals. It's about being totally inconsiderate, unconcerned about boundaries and cruel in the face of your partner's pain.\n\nIt would break my heart into a million pieces if I kept doing something I thought was no big deal and my partner one day broke down crying over it. Especially men, who are often socialized not to show emotions, so likely if he is at that point he's just so tired and exasperated. I would feel so shitty about this, no pun intended. I would be apologizing profusely and making it up to them and saying wow, I can see something about this is a deep need for you and I'm so sorry babe. I wouldn't get on Reddit to call them sensitive and try to drum up support for my behavior. But I dated someone like the OP, and it was such a lonely and horrible feeling that they constantly ignored my needs, called me sensitive and would just stare at me blankly when I was crying and ask if I was done. \n\nTHIS is the true issue of why they're breaking up, that this bathroom saga reveals his partner is a cold and unfeeling asshole who will invalidate him and ignore his reasonable requests and his pain.", "I do too and as someone who absolutely needs time to myself so much so that I would go to a local hotel for Saturday and Sunday now & then.

My thyroid issues dont cause me to use the bathroom or barge in on someone who wants some alone time either.  I\u2019m sure there are thyroid issues with cause issues with the bodies digestive system, but OP never specified what she has.  \n\nOP definitely seems like the AH here.

Its not like we are looking in the toilet or even looking at the other person. But if he\u2019s doing his hair or showering and I need to go, it\u2019s human nature and holding it isn\u2019t good for your body. He  obviously is allowed the same thing. If you\u2019re so weirded out by sitting on a toilet infront of the person you are spending your life with, you must be uncomfortable or embarrassed.

It happens", "About 7 years into marriage I had a very invasive abdominal surgery. Afterwards I told the nurse I needed to pee, badly. She said she would help me get there \"in a minute\". Probably 45 minutes later she finally came back.  I made it maybe 2 steps and pissed on her shoes.  I was still half out of it from the anesthesia,  crying, pissing all over and scared to death because I could barely even stand up, I had drains sticking out of me,  etc. My husband witnessed it all.... super sexy times.", "Good for you, but that's really not the norm and doesn't indicate a lack of respect.", "See that's insane to me.

No.  If I want that sensation I\u2019ll bathe next to an outhouse in a Louisiana summer.", "Not only there is no need to do that, but there is no need to share that.", "I don\u2019t mind peeing* in front of people, but my partner hates it. So what do I do? Close the door. It\u2019s a common courtesy that when your partner expresses a dislike for something that makes them uncomfortable, you don\u2019t do it.

As long as both people are in the same page there is absolutely nothing wrong or abnormal about it. As with every relationship, it's about what works for the people in it. If one person is okay with it but the other is not, there needs to be respect for that limitation within reason (emergency about-to-shit yourself and no other place to go are an obvious exception, but if you can reasonably hold it to respect your partner using the space (especially if they tell you they want the space in advance) then it should be respected).\n\nI'm glad you and your wife have a boundary that you both respect, it doesn't mean that other people's experience or comfort levels are \"bizarre\" just because they don't match yours.", "It sounds to me like op is subconsciously doing this out of resentment towards her partner. Caregiver burnout could explain this, since she mentioned that her fianc\u00e9 became recently disabled and that she mainly takes responsibility for him now. It sounds like she\u2019s trying to mask this as a \u201ccoincidence\u201d issue, when she\u2019s actually sabotaging her partner\u2019s relaxation time because she might feel jealous of it. \n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely that her bowel movements genuinely always first occur when fianc\u00e9 takes a bath, especially if he gives her advanced notice so she can go beforehand. Bowel movements usually don\u2019t have that quick of an onset unless there\u2019s IBS involved or another chronic digestive issue. If this were really that kind of issue, OP would in theory take the opportunity to try and go beforehand in order to avoid inconveniencing her partner, sort of how many people try to go to the bathroom before a big test (even if they don\u2019t really have to go) in order to avoid wasting time in the middle of said test.", "Agree, I almost refuse to believe this Is real with the level of nastiness and zero shame.", "I so love to see you\u2019ve taught your daughter how to honor and speak boundaries.

So it was easier to respect privacy in many ways. My husband grew up in a family of five, with a grandparent that lived with them for a while too, and one bathroom. He has zero qualms about using the bathroom while someone is showering or vice versa.\n\nThere's something different when it's \"I need this time for me\" and the utility of just taking a shower though, I think.", "I\u2019d hold it rather than take a dump in front of anyone, including my hubs. 43 years, we\u2019ve never pooped in front of each other and we haven\u2019t always had two bathrooms.
