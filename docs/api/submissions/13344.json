My fianc\u00e9 was recently in a bad accident leaving him disabled. He was walking to work, hit by a truck, and we\u2019ve been slowly adjusting to new life. The accident damaged his cerebellum and brain stem making motor movements wonky and unbalanced for him. He is back at work but I think he is pushing himself too far.

Sure, sometimes that doesn't work out that way, but if this has happened 10 times, there is no way that 10 times after he was in the bath you then needed to use the restroom and couldn't hold it until he was done. \n\nLet me be clear again, that yes, you can control when you need to use the restroom. I assume you have gone on car rides that last an hour or longer, you go to the movies, you go in to meetings, and for the most part, you can gauge if you need to use the restroom before it begins, and can hold it if the feeling comes on during said activity. You do it everyday, but can't offer your fiance that basic level of respect. \n\nThis matters to your fiance, so you can decide that you don't care about him- this man that you say is so good to you- and that he is too sensitive and keep doing this to him, and probably not end up getting married because you lack a basic level of respect for him.

Even the sh\\*tting aside, he begged you to stop, in tears, and you don't care. He's begging you for 30 minutes of alone time for some self care, and you can't give him that without literally needing to take a sh\\*t all over it? You lied in your first paragraph, you don't love him.", "Lmao I hope you realize this is the minority opinion here.  You're GROSS.  fucking tell him after you've taken your daily shit so he can bathe  (or 2?). If you're shitting more see a doctor girl", "So he\u2019s a kind sensitive man who probably will be a great father and husband. He communicates his problems to maintain a good relationship. While you dismiss him, call him sensitive, and generally be an AH. If he dump you, it will be mostly because of you.", "He\u2019ll get lots of alone time when he dumps you rude ass", "Do you think it\u2019s attractive to shit in front of him?!", "So what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?\nHe very clearly told you that he needs the time for himself. Why can\u2019t you just accept that and respect his need? Your need to make a post and prove you\u2019re right and he\u2019s \u201cover sensitive\u201d shows how immature you are already. The \u201cover sensitive\u201d claim in itself is big red flag of gas lighting\u2026", "I think you enjoy tormenting him. There\u2019s not a single response here that mentions any actual love you feel for him.", "YTA. I was a caregiver for my mom after she had a major surgery with serious complications and was barely able to walk for almost a year. I am currently caretaking for a friend who has been in and out of the hospital with organ failure and memory loss for a couple of months now. There is a massive loss of dignity that comes with being in a vulnerable position like that. They\u2019ve both had to allow me to do and see things that have humiliated them. As a caretaker, but more so as his fianc\u00e9e, it is part of your job and it should be your privilege to preserve what dignity he still has and help him feel secure and cared for. You\u2019re failing. His mental and emotional health have taken a hit with what he\u2019s been through and you\u2019re literally crapping all over his attempts to heal those parts of himself. \n\nI get that you\u2019re scared. Believe me, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time sitting in a chair outside the bathroom door making sure I could hear distress cries if I needed to. But that\u2019s a YOU problem and you have to figure out a way to get a grip on that fear. I read your comment about maybe getting therapy, but I think it\u2019s you that needs it more than him. You need to figure out why you ignore him when he communicates his needs to the point that he breaks down crying rather than work to find a solution that keeps him safe and allows him to feel loved. He deserves better than what you\u2019re doing to him.", "Dig a hole in the yard for your emergency shits and give your hubby a break. YTA", "Ya I agree. You're welcome. And he sounds more like a toddler than a grown adult. If he is ok showering with you then there shouldn't be a problem with normal human bodily functions. Also, does he not go out with friends or anything because that is alone time away from you and that is not an excuse to act like that.", "Yeah, between the post, the edits and the comments, OP is definitely in r/AmITheDevil territory.", "I certainly hope not.", "No kidding, I work out in the bush and don't always feel like squatting in the trees when it's -40\u00b0 out, I've held shits for full 12 hour shifts.", "I know there\u2019s conditions where you have to go to the bathroom a lot, like IBS. I was just being funny, I\u2019m pretty sure OP would\u2019ve mentioned if they had a condition to justify their position", "Being able to work and being able to live independently are not mutually exclusive\n\nEDIT: OP replied to me and deleted her comment (I took a screenshot of the notification but am on mobile so I can't link it) detailing how he had a caregiver that wasn't her at first and that now he can do basic things like bathe and use the toilet but is still dependent on her for a lot of his care", "Yes, I do, too.", "Sure, but when you only have one bathroom, you have to make concessions. That single bathroom can't be \"your space.\"", "It\u2019s like she\u2019s punishing him for asking for any time away from her and she thought she was going to come here and gaslight him into thinking it\u2019s ok", "I think so. He assures me he is fine. But when he was ran over/pedestrian versus vehicle, we weren\u2019t sure what life was going to be like for us. Now he is functional again, back at work, and I\u2019m still concerned. I think he should\u2019ve taken more time away and rested. Cause if he is falls he is already dealing with a TBI. And the accident damaged his balance so he can\u2019t do what he used to do. He randomly falls sometimes when he is doing tasks. He claims he is fine but I\u2019ve known him long enough that he regularly pushes himself way too hard. He goes to regular medical appointments and it\u2019s been hard on him. But he got into his accident then tried to go answer his emails in the trauma center in and out of scans and pain medications\u2014he isn\u2019t the best gauge for assessment.", "Don\u2019t you think taking a dump by his head, as opposed to knocking on the door, is going beyond smothering him?

She thinks he\u2019s being too sensitive and needs to get over it, so she literally just doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s asked her to stop. I see from the edit he is recovering from an injury, so there\u2019s likely some insecurity here on her part about that and fear that\u2019s causing her to \u201ccheck on him\u201d but she needs to figure out another way to deal with it.", "It\u2019s a sliding door and he became disabled from a bad accident a few months ago, so he leaves it unlatched so anyone can get in a moments notice if they need to.", "OP said she is going #2. This is wrong on so many levels.\n\nThe guy wants to have the aromatherapy and time alone and is disturbed both physically and sensory.", "No. Sometimes he will come in and brush his teeth and his hair if we are getting ready to go somewhere. Before the accident, he used to get ready then do the dishes while he waited cause he said his dad used to rush his mom so it gives him something to do. But that\u2019s all stopped since the accident. He gets dressed and lays in bed and just waits for me to be ready.", "What if he literally just wants to have a bath?\n\n*Have you ever heard of that?*", "That just means she did it so often that he had to start counting", "Well she *sure doesn't seem apologetic of dropping fat deuces during his baths*", "I think people need to understand the fact that OP states they have a thyroid issue.  If they have graves disease or some other form of hyperthyroidism, shitting is not something you just get to decide to wait to do.  Before my mom got her thyroid radiated she was literally at a point of having to wear diapers if she wasn't going to be around a toilet.  Now that she doesn't have a thyroid, she has to take levothyroxine to make up for it.  And guess what that medication does?  It makes you shit urgently, she'll sometimes skip it in the morning if she knows she won't be near a toilet. Same thing with my friend who has grave's disease. \n\nNot everyone gets to just have good control over their bowel movements, something many of us take for granted.", "10 times in a row? He\u2019s had to smell shit 10 times when he is trying to take a bath to relax. He gives her warning before hand and she STILL can\u2019t respect him enough to not shit while he is in there. \n\nAfter 10 times of trying to relax without smelling shit, I would cry too.

How is THAT not the polite thing to do?  Why stink it up for his baths?  OP is nastayyy", "Jesus christ, it is not dangerous to once every couple of weeks to hold it for 30 minutes. How do you maintain a job? Do you crap in the hallway if you can't find a toilet?", "But do you shit on a schedule?  Seriously, with the exception of waking up first thing in the morning, its ridiculous that she needs to shit every time he bathes.  If she cared at all she would at least try to sit on the pot and go in that 30 minute window he gave her.  You know, kinda like when your on a road trip and you stop and everyone tries to use the bathroom so you don't have to stop for 1 person 10 minutes down the road.", "I mean, when I was pregnant I shit up to 4 times a day.  But I'm guessing if this was a factor she would have mentioned it.  Also, there's no way these perfectly timed shits are all accidents.

Tell him not to bathe since you haven't shit yet ..it's not hard and it's not a fucking medical issue.  \n\nEww.", "going out with friends =/= alone time\n\nhe is literally just asking for 30 minutes of alone time, and she is dismissive of him and refusing to respect that boundary. SHE is the toddler here.", "Oof imagine calling a recently disabled man a crybaby. You sound like a really big man.", "Breaking down is what happens when people are subjected to large amounts of physical, mental and emotional trauma that just won't stop. This man was a pedestrian who was literally hit by a moving vehicle, there was serious concern about whether you would ever walk again, he struggled through painful medical treatments and got physical therapy to get back on his feet but the OP can't give him a fucking minute to himself ever, just to think. Not even to bath without OP walking in have a nice bit shit right beside him 10 times in a row. And then OP bumps into a wonderful twin soul that supports her absolutely deplorable behavior. This is a Kodak moment for sure.", "F Jessica Morrell, all my homies hate Jessica Morrell", "He couldn\u2019t do basic things on his own the first couple of months and had a caretaker who wasn\u2019t me for a month. Now he can do basic things, go to work, but can\u2019t drive. Forgets some things and also looses his balance so he has daily appointments of neurology, chiro, therapy, etc. \n\nHe used to be very active. Gardener, ballet, did work around the house, travelled around the world, even active as a teacher with his students. And I don\u2019t know if any of that will return. His parents took us out to eat to get out of the house and he struggled in pain but was insistent to do it.", "If you know that somebody's planning on being in there for half an hour to relax you can poop beforehand or hold it. If you can't make it 30 minutes without an emergency then maybe you should take medical attention. He says it's happened over 10 times. That's a lot of times to not be able to plan your bowel movements.", "So your answer to him having a difficult time is to shit in front of him every single chance you get? If you were popping in to check that he needed something your concern might be remotely believable. As it stands you sound like someone hindering the end of his recovery period. If he's been medically clear to go back to work, he can bathe himself without your sitting beside him stinking up the place.", "So... this bath time is probably the *only* chance he gets to not have you, or someone, hovering around and concerned for him 24/7. \n\nYou need to stop. \n\nYou need to let your grown man husband have space and time to himself. \n\nIf you're that concerned that he'll fall in the bathroom it's not unreasonable to verbally check on him through the door, maybe once during his bath time. \n\n\"Hey sweetie, are you doing alright?\"\n\n\"yes, I'm fine!\"\n\n\"Okay, just checking, love you\"\n\nand that's it. After that you ask him no further questions, you offer no support or commentary and you sure as hell don't go sit down and drop toilet bombs while he's trying to enjoy bath bombs.", "Honestly I don't think you are worried about him taking a bath. \n\nIf you was, you wouldn't go into the bathroom to use the toilet and have a number 2 at that. You would just knock on the door to check he is OK.\n\nYou need to give him space and time to relax.", "There's checking on him and then there's taking a dump right next to him. One's understandable given the circumstances. The other's really, really rude. \n\nBut if he's cleared for work - didn't see where you say what he does - then try to trust that he can take care of himself for 30 minutes in the bath.", "Hmhh now that more people say yta, you are just concerned because he had an accident, convenient hm", "My fianc\u00e9 (now husband) almost died in a skiing accident a few years ago.

You don't have to shit next to him to see if he's okay. You sound like you're making excuses for your bad behavior.", "I guarantee you the solution to ensure he's fine is not to barge into the bathroom to drop a drive every time he takes a bath.", "Naw, if fear was causing her want to check on him, she'd stick her head in or ask. I was seriously injured in a MVA when someone t-boned into the passenger side where I was sitting. Much like the OP's boyfriend, we didn't know what my future was going to look like either. \n\nIt was a total mind fuck every step of the way. I needed time to myself, empathy and emotional support, not someone in face every minute of every day, even to the point of shitting in front of me when I was trying to relax. If I'd had to deal with someone telling me that I was to sensitive and stuck to me like glue, I would have lost my mind.
