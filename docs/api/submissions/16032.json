I wouldn't want to if he had no reason to kick to roommate out.

Honestly, whether he knew the money was for rent or not he shouldn't spend $1000 on something he doesn't need when rent is due.

Some people can tolerate that stuff and some people can't. \n\nI think approximately 50/50 is fair and reasonable, with the stipulation lifestyle has to be within the means of the lower-earning partner. I mean if you weren't with him you'd probably be with a roommate paying about half of the rent.\n\nI'm assuming you currently live in a 2BD, since you had a roommate.
