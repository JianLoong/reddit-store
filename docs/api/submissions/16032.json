That man has higher expectations from their partner than the peak of Everest. \nwith that being said, the only asshole here is your fianc\u00e9", "NTA, what kind of fianc\u00e9 would allow you to work 50 hours a week over two jobs for something he said he could afford? You also mentioned his temper a lot which is worrying. Get out, OP.", "The red flags are at full staff. Get out get out get out. It should be a klaxon blaring in your brain. Get out get out get out get out get out\u2026.", "You have bigger, long term fish to fry with guy. Not good", "I think you need to re-evaluate what exactly you are getting out of this relationship.\n\n\nHes got a temper, droge out your roommate and said he'd cover their part of the rent, tried to force you to pay half the shortfall he caused, gets paid way more than you but can't save for shit, you gave him money and he immediately spent it on stupid shit for himself, and he's basically bullying you for more money.\n\n\nAre you holding out for him to change? Because realistically it's not going to happen. Don't settle just to avoid being single.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You have problems...\n\nAre you on the lease for the rental? If yes , talk to and pay your landlord. Exit the lease ASAP. Or take over the lease, throw him out and get new room-mates. Terms and Conditions will apply.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 sounds like as big a piece of work as your last roommate. Exit that commitment ASAP.  Try to keep it civil. \n\nIf you are not legally responsible for the rental... bounce. As quickly and quietly as possible. Leave them to manage the fall-out.\n\nDo not argue. Do what you think is best for yourself. Legal and financial and most importantly... your safety. \n\nFly off the handle = unstable.

What are you doing. This is only gonna go one way.", "NTA\n\nAnd get out of that relationship immediately. Clearly he isn't capable of empathy and you have already listed two examples of his inability to communicate and relate to other people. He very clearly doesnt respect you either. If you stay with him, he will steam roll right over you.", "NTA. Did he think you were just giving him money out of the goodness of your heart?! At minimum he\u2019s just a jerk, but what you described shows he has an anger problem, doesn\u2019t pay attention to what is going on in your life, and is extremely self-centered.  Think long and hard on tying yourself to this type of person; it doesn\u2019t get better.", "It's his fault he wasted his money on toys. And he didn't consult you on kicking out roommate, so he should be covering the roommate's entire rent.  However, are you sure you're even compatible? None of what you're talking about here sounds like you are - different priorities, ways of communicating, etc. NTA.", "NTA, even if you WERE living there in an agreement, your chunk of rent should be relevant to your pay, if you bring in 40% of the household income, you pay 40% if the bills, that\u2019s how partners handle it.\n\nThe reason you should leave it two part for me, you say he flies off the handle and caused the roommate to leave, AND this idiot thought you just sent him $1000 for fun. That\u2019s weaponized incompetence to the MAX. He clearly doesn\u2019t care about your situation financially. He\u2019s not ignorant of it, he willfully doesn\u2019t care. He thinks you should be gifting him money like this. Run before you get locked into this one sided relationship.", "NTA. If Your fianc\u00e9 wants you to pay 50% you\u2019re nothing but another roommate.  Having a man should make your life easier not harder.", "Uhm. Why are you marrying him?", "NTA and don\u2019t marry this guy he sounds terrible", "Run, run, run. Sounds like financial abuse just waiting to happen, if shit like this carries on. NTA.", "Don\u2019t marry him bc y\u2019all will have financial issues in the long run if you marry him", "Dude you\u2019re seriously marrying this guy? He is clearly unstable", "I think you should leave that relationship behind. His abuse will get worse during the marriage NTA", "NTA\n\nLet me get this straight, you gave him 1k and he used it for his own hobbies? Did he think you were just giving him a gift and not, you know, intending to use the money for joint expenses? Even if you didn\u2019t specify, it\u2019s a weird assumption to make.\n\nAnd then he drove out your roommate with his temper. That is a BIG red flag. It\u2019s one thing to be frustrated with a roommates habits, but flying off the handle like that is not normal or healthy behaviour. I would reconsider this whole relationship if I were you.", "OP, you\u2019re NTA. \n\nAnd it\u2019s time to DTMFA.", "So what he thought you were just handing him the same amount for rent/bills every month and because you didn\u2019t spell it out this month , it\u2019s ok that he blew through it? What an asshole", "NTA\n\nI recently broke off an engagement for similar issues: my ex had an explosive and unpredictable temper, was impulsive with money, would make financial or life statements and not hold to them, criticize me, enjoyed mind games and bragged on how in any room he knew he could manipulate to get what he wants.\n\nDon\u2019t do this to yourself, your peace, dignity, and safety are more important.", "NTA. Wtf. He is incredibly abusive and you need to run. He\u2019s playing dumb and overspent and expects you to fund his lifestyle. \n\nHe kicked roommate out and refuses to get another\u2026 I\u2019d tell him he\u2019s responsible for their portion and his (2/3) while you pay you\u2019re usual 1/3. That is until you escape.", "NTA. [insert instant ban inducing comments here]", "NTA. Even if it wasn't entirely his fault for the roommate leaving (which it is), a loving, healthy couple (especially one about to be married) is supposed to support each other. As in- if one is making less money, the other can bridge the gap and support them until the pay between the two is more even. Not, you know, force an even split that's easy for one partner to handle but would kill the other's.", "NTA  Your post makes it obvious that he's abusing you financially and makes me wonder what other tricks he might be playing. Your fiance is treating you like a roommate...at best.", "NTA. You gave him $1000 and he didn\u2019t ask what it was for before blowing it on junk??\nBack when we dated and to this day my husband and I split the bills based on our income. Based on what you said 70/30 or 80/20 would be \u201cfair\u201d \nThat aside, the lack of empathy and communication on this issue is a huge red flag. You deserve better. Agree with everyone else saying leave. These things don\u2019t get better once ur married", "Your fianc\u00e9 is a major problem and you need to make sure you are safe and in the right environment for your own well-being. OP you do not deserve to be treated that way by anyone. Splitting bills by % of income is a much healthier solution, so that said I can imagine $1k in a place where rent alone is $3k isn\u2019t as fair of a share, again predicated on your partner being someone who deserves that care and place in your life.", "NTA. Also, explosive anger is a zero tolerance red flag. Don't work with him on this issue. It needs to be sorted before he's in a relationship. He doesn't have a stinky roommate to zero in on now. You're the only target in the place for his blowups. His financial irresponsibility is also mind blowing and a very good secondary reason to get out now.", "NTA but your fianc\u00e9 is. Find a fianc\u00e9 who doesn\u2019t fly off the handle pretty quickly, this one is red-flag central.", "I never tell Randos to leave but omg leave this could lead to a type of financial abuse u alreY knows he goes off the handle", "This guy will treat you worse once you are married, not better.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9major red flags.\nNTA, and I seriously suggest ending this relationship safely", "Cancel it all together lol", "I'm also tempted to say Flee. But perhaps there are other qualities to the person. So perhaps \"work on the temper issue\" may be a lenient advice? \n\nBut yes, I agree a few red flags and an expiration date visible on the package", "How can you do this thing where you take The sentences of the OP?", "Yeah, the OP should consider ending the relationship as her fianc\u00e9 is unlikely to improve once she\u2019s legally bound to him", "Yeah OP you can't marry this guy. First, you two aren't on the same page with how to share expenses, or how to deal with finances in general. Second, you're gonna have a hard time getting on the same page because he's manipulative and sees every interaction as a possible way to \"win\"-- with you losing. That's gonna be how it goes for your entire relationship with this guy. Is that something you wanna be doing when you're 60? When you're 45? In two years? Next week?", "Yeah, this sounds like the kind of guy that will let house go into foreclosure , but just bought a boat.  \n\nAlso when a roommate warns you that he\u2019s terrible , believe them, they\u2019ve seen him at his very worst.", "Definitely this; This is not a healthy relationship for OP to be in... it will not end well.", "What monster is trying to keep score with their fiance like that? He's the one that told the roommate he could afford the place himself. OP, please do not marry this man.", "I agree. I can\u2019t stress this enough. He sounds absolutely horrible, and if people outside the relationship can\u2019t stand him, I bet the person inside the relationship has it much worse. OP needs to get away as soon as possible, he\u2019s not marriage material and this is a glimpse of the future (hell) they\u2019re in for.", "I disagree. Both people should pay their entire paycheck into a joint account. Then you split out an even amount to each person as personal money. I would feel awful if my Fiance had less money than me each month. Why do I deserve more money simply because I happen to be in a job that earns more? We are an equal team and any parishes or windfalls I get are for the betterment of us as a team not for me personally.", "That's marinara you are smelling", "Used for cleaning floors (I think)", "Genuinely. He needs to return all that stuff he bought and pay the rent he said he could afford. Without OP\u2019s money.", "Came here to write this. If you intend to stay with this guy, you need to talk and establish ground rules for your money. Pay stuff proportionally.

And sex usually isn't that good with a selfish person.", "Working on a temper issue wouldn't be a prudent choice in a relationship. Women who work on temper issues with men can end up in a bad place.

Like wtf. Thinking back on it now it's clear it was a ridiculous situation and a ridiculous relationship, and the fact that op is even asking if she's the ah tells me he has her so tied up in knots she doesn't know what's up and what's down anymore.\n\nOP, NTA and leave him. He created the issue, he cause problems for you and himself, he has no leg to stand on to ask for more money, and you don't owe him more than a third of that 2800 every month.
