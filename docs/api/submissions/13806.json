My property is the only house on the street that\u2019s privately rented, as my landlord bought her house from the council a long time ago. Every other house is council owned. I\u2019ve lived here for about 2 years now. I have a neighbour, Helen (63f) who has been a nuisance since I moved in, and apparently the entire time she\u2019s lived here. She harasses all of our neighbours about little things like what time they take their bins out, how empty or full their recycling bins are etc. \n\nWhen I moved in she made a few comments about how she hates that young person moved in and how I\u2019m probably going to be a party animal. That\u2019s not true, I have a full-time job and I\u2019m studying for a PhD, I don\u2019t have time for parties and I\u2019m rarely home during the week. A few months ago she complained that she didn\u2019t like that a tree in my front garden blocked the light coming into her garden, so I cut the branches short so it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Then she complained they were too short. She complained about the noise from a dinner party I had at new year\u2019s to everyone but me. Since I moved in she\u2019s found something to complain about at least once a week. But my girlfriend moved in with me 6 months ago, and since then it\u2019s been constant. Almost daily. Her biggest complaint is that my girlfriend always comes home dirty and sometimes there\u2019s mud on the communal path (which we always clean). My girlfriend is a field archaeologist, obviously she gets dirty. No one else minds this (I\u2019ve asked). \n\nThe final straw came last week. I\u2019ve had various people over to interview them for my thesis, all men. She told my girlfriend I was cheating on her because I\u2019d had 10 gentlemen callers this week (it was 3 elderly French men). My girlfriend freaked out and we had a massive fight where both of us were confused before we realised. I filed a complaint with our council. Unbeknownst to me, our council has a 3 strikes and your out policy. I was the 3rd complaint. Now she faces the possibility of having to move or being evicted in her 60s. I didn\u2019t intend for that to happen. She\u2019s been accosting us every time she sees us since.

This is 100% on her.", "NTA - she has been stirring the shit pot all along, all you did was have her take a taste from the spoon.", "NTA. People like that have nothing better to do but putting their nose in everyone else's business. Since she meddled in your relationship, you had every right, and after putting up with it for so long\n Who knows how many people put up with so much without complaining. You have the right to live in peace.", "NTA. She was harrassing you.", "This is called \u201cF Around And Find Out What Happens\u201d. She has found out. \n\n- You could have lost a relationship. Or had those interviews interrupted and ruined.\n- She may have mental issues that could be better dealt with support elsewhere. You cannot help her. Some other group needs to and this might be the catalyst.\n- You did not do the first two complaints.\n- You did not make the three strikes rule.\n- It is daily harassment.\n- It\u2019s been TWO YEARS.\n\nNTA.\n\nEnjoy a potentially lovely summer without that hanging over you, and good luck with the PhD (only just got mine, you deserve some peace!!)", "NTA. She is a busy body who is making it her business when it isn't. She has known about her previous strikes and yet continued with her behavior. She either didn't think the rules applied to her (most likely) or just didn't care to follow them. \n\nHer behavior is what has caused this. She has had two other opportunities to mind her own business and leave her neighbors alone.", "NTA - YOU  didn't get her evicted - her long history of bad behavior did.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t you who got her kicked out - she *knew* she already has two strikes to her name, and yet she didn\u2019t change her behavior. At this point, if it wasn\u2019t you, it would be someone else. \n\nAlso, you made your complaint to a third party who made the actual decision and decided on the punishment. Once you filed the complaint, it was out of your hands. \n\nOf course she will blame you - people like her are masters at not taking responsibility for their own actions. If she didn\u2019t want to be evicted when in her 60s, then all she had to do was to be civil to her neighbors. \n\nAlso, unfortunately, I think you are also being made a scapegoat by the council - they\u2019ve probably wanted to get rid of her for years, and are using your complaint as their excuse to do so, and are also letting you take the heat for their decision.", "NTA It's not a one strike policy. That means she's been warned two times already, and still chose to enact a personal vendetta against you. Being in your 60s doesn't mean your actions don't have consequences.", "NTA. She played stupid games and now she wins stupid prizes.", "NTA - The other 2 strikes are not your fault or your business or anything to feel guilty of. She got herself into that mess. The fact that she told your partner you were 'cheating' when you are innocent is completely disgraceful. \n\nBefore she did this, you were as good as you could be to her, you even complied with some of the demands she had no right to make just because you are a good neighbour. Even after that she didn't see that you were kind to her and still chose to ruin your life with your girlfriend so please don't go feeling sorry for her. Judging from her past behaviour and lack of acknowledging how you have tried to make it comfortable with her, I'm sure she will still be ungrateful even if you withdraw your complaint to help her. It's up to you what you want to do but I think it would be unwise to withdraw your complaint. Let her sort her living situation by herself.", "Oh. So she might get evicted. Well, sucks for her. \n\nWhen she is actively being moved out, I would sit in my front stoop and drink a beer and watch. Good riddance. \n\nYou have been putting up with her for two years. After the first couple of times of her complaining to me, I would start carrying a small, portable air horn in my purse. She approaches me outside? Reach in my purse. She cranks up? Pull it out and BLAST.\n\nSometimes people are stubborn. Sometimes you have to train them. Sometimes it takes repetition. NTA", "NTA. Your neighbor KNEW she was on the Council's Naughty List.  She knew the rules and what was at stake. Instead of behaving herself, she continued to be a rude, invasive person trying to micromanage everyone around her. You did nothing wrong - you were only the most recent complaint on the list of people who were being harassed by her. You did not do this to her, she did this to herself. If you hadn't complained, someone else would have sooner or later.", "NTA. I'm 64, and it seems like older people tend to go two ways. They either become bitter or become more mellow. Your neighbor has become a bitter old lady. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  You didn't know it could be her third strike, and honestly that shouldn't be part of your concern.  Your neighbor harasses you and other people.  Who in their right mind goes and looks in a neighbor's bin to see how much waste/recycling they put out that week?\n\nYou deserve to live in peace. Helen is 63, she is not incapacitated.  She can work with the council to find other housing.", "NTA and the fact your the third person to file a complaint shows she is a nuisance to everyone.\n\nIt's sounds like she is this nosy and overbearing to a lot of people.\n\nThe neighborhood has spoken and it is not an asshole.  This sounds like it was a long time coming.", "NTA. Neighbor is the pain in the patootie and you are feeling guilty for reporting her loathsome behavior. Don\u2019t feel guilty. The nail in the coffin to me is how she is now harassing you over the complaint instead of apologizing and promising to do better. She is such a piece of work that you should be happy you\u2019ve been the catalyst for others in the world to get to enjoy her cray-cray. This is not something you want to horde for yourself.", "INFO: did you make a complaint on homophobia grounds? it seems like since the complaints and harassment intensified after your girlfriend moved in and it was clear you were a couple that might have been justified. \n\nregardless, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All of you have been very patient with her, which essentially enabled her grand sense of entitlement tbh, and that 3rd strike was looooong overdue. As long as she remains there, unless she starts behaving like a proper adult and tolerable neighbor, I encourage you & your other neighbors to start standing your ground by filing complaints when she crosses the line.

I'm sure she was warned after two strikes and she continued to generate complaints. I don't understand how your gf believed her about you cheating without even asking you about it first!

The argument was about the quantity of strangers in our home when I told her there would only be 3 so I understand the confusion and the suspicion she felt. I would be uncomfortable if she was inviting way more strangers into our home than she said she was, too. It took us a while to realise that Helen had lied about the quantity (and also about the cheating). She had taken pictures of 2 of the men as proof and showed them to my girlfriend which did lend a teeny shred of credibility.", "Or, you know, she could\u2019ve used the first warnings as an opportunity to change. Plus, it\u2019s not like you complained due to one interaction. There were multiple that pushed you, and likely the same with the first two reporters.", "This is the wrong attitude.\n\nIf you had known that two prior complaints were made, it should show you that she has a pattern of inappropriate behavior and you are right to take it seriously.", "You are not responsible for protecting this person from the consequences of her own actions. It\u2019s probably good that you didn\u2019t know since you are thinking you should have suffered to protect her from her own actions. You should let the council know that she has ramped up her abuse since your complaint rather than feel bad that you complained.", "People like your neighbor will never change, their only joy in life is seeing others in misery because they themselves are miserable. It\u2019s sad, but completely unacceptable to bring that negativity down on others. Even if you had done everything possible to appease her, she will always find something else. Like you\u2019ve experienced with the tree. She brought this on herself, she will continue you to bring it on herself, and nothing you can do will change her. She had two strikes already, which means it was only a matter of time before she got her third strike. IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY, is what I\u2019m trying to say. Yes, it would have been nice if it was filed by someone else, that way you could feel guilt free and a problem was resolved, but we can\u2019t always go through life without taking an action in response to someone else making your life miserable. This is a consequence to her actions, and had she not been so spiteful and petty, she would never have had to experience it. It\u2019s ok to feel a little pity and guilt, but don\u2019t dwell on it, and move on.", "She did this to herself with her behaviour. Quite honestly, I'm surprised it took this long for her to gain 3 complaints. You've been more than patient with her over the past few years (as have your other neighbours).", "Of course you didn't, but she must be aware of the rules, as she lived there for so long. Longevity and old age does not mean there is no consequence.", "OP - here is the thing this type of person will not stop. They will always find an issue no matter how much you cater to their wishes. Eviction is the only solution that will give you piece of mind", "That you feel bad shows your empathy but truly she did this too herself.  A good start might be a good thing for her too.", "NTA.\n\nEnjoy a potentially lovely summer without that hanging over you", "That\u2019s a good point. Thank you.", "You are absolutely correct. Mean people are that way because they are miserable themselves. Can you imagine how much better her life would be if she was friendly and considerate of others.", "What behavior of hers did you make a complaint about? In my community the behaviors you describe would be annoying for any neighbor but would also be no concern for a landlord.  Your girlfriend got upset with you over unpleasant gossip from a neighbor who you both already believed was unreliable.", "JFC. There\u2019s a \u20183 strikes and you\u2019re out policy\u2019 and Helen knew she was on number 2 already. Yet not only did she harass you to the point that you had no choice but to deliver number 3, SHE IS *STILL* HARASSING YOU.\n\nDefinitely NTA, OP. But you\u2019re far too nice.\n\nHelen had 2 simple choices: stop harassing people and remain in her home, or continue to harass people and be evicted. She chose the wrong option. That\u2019s not on you.", "NTA. None of this is your fault. If you didn't turn in that complaint as her 3rd strike, someone else would have, which I know because she's already caused 2 other strikes from others already. If she didn't want to get evicted in her 60s, she shouldn't have done behavior that will cause her to get evicted in her 60s.", "**NTA.** She's been a royal pain to the other neighbors, spied on you and harassed you constantly over every little thing, and even tried to ruin your relationship with a mere nosy assumption. \n\nShe'd already caused enough trouble in the past to earn the first two complaints *before* you moved in, and she clearly never learned her lesson from either of them; this third and last strike is entirely her own fault.", "NTA if she didn't want people to complain about her she should've been less of a nuisance. You had no way of knowing the status of her strike tally. You've put up with a lot from her without complaining until now, and even tried to accommodate her. She crossed a line, and it happened to be one too many. You didn't file all three complaints with the express intention of kicking her out.

Or did she not know you were together and was just trying to imply that you were being a bad roommate by making it look like ~loose women~ live there, like this is a film set in a tenement in the 30s with a no-men-in-your-rented-room rule and she\u2019s the nosy landlady who protects everyone\u2019s virtue or something? So weird. \n\nBut anyway that\u2019s immaterial. NTA. This is exactly what the three strike complaint system is for.", "NTA. She is experiencing the natural consequences of her actions.
