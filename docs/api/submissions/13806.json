My property is the only house on the street that\u2019s privately rented, as my landlord bought her house from the council a long time ago. Every other house is council owned. I\u2019ve lived here for about 2 years now. I have a neighbour, Helen (63f) who has been a nuisance since I moved in, and apparently the entire time she\u2019s lived here. She harasses all of our neighbours about little things like what time they take their bins out, how empty or full their recycling bins are etc. \n\nWhen I moved in she made a few comments about how she hates that young person moved in and how I\u2019m probably going to be a party animal. That\u2019s not true, I have a full-time job and I\u2019m studying for a PhD, I don\u2019t have time for parties and I\u2019m rarely home during the week. A few months ago she complained that she didn\u2019t like that a tree in my front garden blocked the light coming into her garden, so I cut the branches short so it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Then she complained they were too short. She complained about the noise from a dinner party I had at new year\u2019s to everyone but me. Since I moved in she\u2019s found something to complain about at least once a week. But my girlfriend moved in with me 6 months ago, and since then it\u2019s been constant. Almost daily. Her biggest complaint is that my girlfriend always comes home dirty and sometimes there\u2019s mud on the communal path (which we always clean). My girlfriend is a field archaeologist, obviously she gets dirty. No one else minds this (I\u2019ve asked). \n\nThe final straw came last week. I\u2019ve had various people over to interview them for my thesis, all men. She told my girlfriend I was cheating on her because I\u2019d had 10 gentlemen callers this week (it was 3 elderly French men). My girlfriend freaked out and we had a massive fight where both of us were confused before we realised. I filed a complaint with our council. Unbeknownst to me, our council has a 3 strikes and your out policy. I was the 3rd complaint. Now she faces the possibility of having to move or being evicted in her 60s.

You have the right to live in peace.", "NTA. She was harrassing you.", "This is called \u201cF Around And Find Out What Happens\u201d. She has found out. \n\n- You could have lost a relationship. Or had those interviews interrupted and ruined.\n- She may have mental issues that could be better dealt with support elsewhere. You cannot help her.

She has had two other opportunities to mind her own business and leave her neighbors alone.", "NTA - YOU  didn't get her evicted - her long history of bad behavior did.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t you who got her kicked out - she *knew* she already has two strikes to her name, and yet she didn\u2019t change her behavior. At this point, if it wasn\u2019t you, it would be someone else. \n\nAlso, you made your complaint to a third party who made the actual decision and decided on the punishment. Once you filed the complaint, it was out of your hands. \n\nOf course she will blame you - people like her are masters at not taking responsibility for their own actions. If she didn\u2019t want to be evicted when in her 60s, then all she had to do was to be civil to her neighbors. \n\nAlso, unfortunately, I think you are also being made a scapegoat by the council - they\u2019ve probably wanted to get rid of her for years, and are using your complaint as their excuse to do so, and are also letting you take the heat for their decision.", "NTA It's not a one strike policy. That means she's been warned two times already, and still chose to enact a personal vendetta against you. Being in your 60s doesn't mean your actions don't have consequences.", "NTA. She played stupid games and now she wins stupid prizes.", "NTA - The other 2 strikes are not your fault or your business or anything to feel guilty of. She got herself into that mess. The fact that she told your partner you were 'cheating' when you are innocent is completely disgraceful. \n\nBefore she did this, you were as good as you could be to her, you even complied with some of the demands she had no right to make just because you are a good neighbour. Even after that she didn't see that you were kind to her and still chose to ruin your life with your girlfriend so please don't go feeling sorry for her. Judging from her past behaviour and lack of acknowledging how you have tried to make it comfortable with her, I'm sure she will still be ungrateful even if you withdraw your complaint to help her. It's up to you what you want to do but I think it would be unwise to withdraw your complaint. Let her sort her living situation by herself.", "Oh. So she might get evicted. Well, sucks for her. \n\nWhen she is actively being moved out, I would sit in my front stoop and drink a beer and watch. Good riddance. \n\nYou have been putting up with her for two years.

She knew the rules and what was at stake. Instead of behaving herself, she continued to be a rude, invasive person trying to micromanage everyone around her. You did nothing wrong - you were only the most recent complaint on the list of people who were being harassed by her. You did not do this to her, she did this to herself. If you hadn't complained, someone else would have sooner or later.", "NTA. I'm 64, and it seems like older people tend to go two ways. They either become bitter or become more mellow. Your neighbor has become a bitter old lady. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  You didn't know it could be her third strike, and honestly that shouldn't be part of your concern.  Your neighbor harasses you and other people.  Who in their right mind goes and looks in a neighbor's bin to see how much waste/recycling they put out that week?\n\nYou deserve to live in peace. Helen is 63, she is not incapacitated.  She can work with the council to find other housing.", "NTA and the fact your the third person to file a complaint shows she is a nuisance to everyone.\n\nIt's sounds like she is this nosy and overbearing to a lot of people.\n\nThe neighborhood has spoken and it is not an asshole.  This sounds like it was a long time coming.", "NTA. Neighbor is the pain in the patootie and you are feeling guilty for reporting her loathsome behavior. Don\u2019t feel guilty. The nail in the coffin to me is how she is now harassing you over the complaint instead of apologizing and promising to do better. She is such a piece of work that you should be happy you\u2019ve been the catalyst for others in the world to get to enjoy her cray-cray. This is not something you want to horde for yourself.", "INFO: did you make a complaint on homophobia grounds? it seems like since the complaints and harassment intensified after your girlfriend moved in and it was clear you were a couple that might have been justified. \n\nregardless, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s sad, but completely unacceptable to bring that negativity down on others. Even if you had done everything possible to appease her, she will always find something else. Like you\u2019ve experienced with the tree. She brought this on herself, she will continue you to bring it on herself, and nothing you can do will change her. She had two strikes already, which means it was only a matter of time before she got her third strike. IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY, is what I\u2019m trying to say. Yes, it would have been nice if it was filed by someone else, that way you could feel guilt free and a problem was resolved, but we can\u2019t always go through life without taking an action in response to someone else making your life miserable.

Respectfully, so what? I can't believe that the council would try to boot a long term tenant because you have a disagreement about dust on a pathway, or that she thinks your parties are too loud. Three strikes such as, \"The tenant's house is in a constant state of disrepair,\" or, \"The tenant leaves garbage outside and attracts vermin to the community,\" or \"The tenant is regularly blasting her music at 3 in the morning,\" may be cause for a case for an eviction.

My country has very strict laws about workplace harassment and would not be tolerated at all. But I had to remind myself that I did nothing wrong and it was his behavior that got him fired and I had the right to feel safe and comfortable at work. Besides, it's his problem if he can't support himself with just one job, it's his fault. It seems like you're guilty because of her being in her 60s (if I read between the lines correctly). It doesn't matter what age, it's still wrong what she did. You did nothing wrong at all. You have nothing to be sorry for.

You\u2019re connected to only one of the complaints and she is responsible for all of them. The reason for the complaint system is to prevent one person from lowering the livability of a community. She was so completely out of line speaking to your girlfriend the way she did. I\u2019m assuming the council informed her of each of the first 2 complaints. So she knew she was on notice and she still chose to make trouble. It is regrettable but she is of an age to be responsible for her actions, and she has to live with it.
