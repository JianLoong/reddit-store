My property is the only house on the street that\u2019s privately rented, as my landlord bought her house from the council a long time ago. Every other house is council owned. I\u2019ve lived here for about 2 years now. I have a neighbour, Helen (63f) who has been a nuisance since I moved in, and apparently the entire time she\u2019s lived here. She harasses all of our neighbours about little things like what time they take their bins out, how empty or full their recycling bins are etc. \n\nWhen I moved in she made a few comments about how she hates that young person moved in and how I\u2019m probably going to be a party animal. That\u2019s not true, I have a full-time job and I\u2019m studying for a PhD, I don\u2019t have time for parties and I\u2019m rarely home during the week. A few months ago she complained that she didn\u2019t like that a tree in my front garden blocked the light coming into her garden, so I cut the branches short so it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Then she complained they were too short. She complained about the noise from a dinner party I had at new year\u2019s to everyone but me. Since I moved in she\u2019s found something to complain about at least once a week. But my girlfriend moved in with me 6 months ago, and since then it\u2019s been constant. Almost daily. Her biggest complaint is that my girlfriend always comes home dirty and sometimes there\u2019s mud on the communal path (which we always clean). My girlfriend is a field archaeologist, obviously she gets dirty. No one else minds this (I\u2019ve asked). \n\nThe final straw came last week. I\u2019ve had various people over to interview them for my thesis, all men. She told my girlfriend I was cheating on her because I\u2019d had 10 gentlemen callers this week (it was 3 elderly French men). My girlfriend freaked out and we had a massive fight where both of us were confused before we realised. I filed a complaint with our council. Unbeknownst to me, our council has a 3 strikes and your out policy. I was the 3rd complaint. Now she faces the possibility of having to move or being evicted in her 60s.

You have the right to live in peace.", "NTA. She was harrassing you.", "This is called \u201cF Around And Find Out What Happens\u201d. She has found out. \n\n- You could have lost a relationship. Or had those interviews interrupted and ruined.\n- She may have mental issues that could be better dealt with support elsewhere. You cannot help her.

She has had two other opportunities to mind her own business and leave her neighbors alone.", "NTA - YOU  didn't get her evicted - her long history of bad behavior did.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t you who got her kicked out - she *knew* she already has two strikes to her name, and yet she didn\u2019t change her behavior. At this point, if it wasn\u2019t you, it would be someone else. \n\nAlso, you made your complaint to a third party who made the actual decision and decided on the punishment. Once you filed the complaint, it was out of your hands. \n\nOf course she will blame you - people like her are masters at not taking responsibility for their own actions. If she didn\u2019t want to be evicted when in her 60s, then all she had to do was to be civil to her neighbors. \n\nAlso, unfortunately, I think you are also being made a scapegoat by the council - they\u2019ve probably wanted to get rid of her for years, and are using your complaint as their excuse to do so, and are also letting you take the heat for their decision.", "NTA It's not a one strike policy. That means she's been warned two times already, and still chose to enact a personal vendetta against you. Being in your 60s doesn't mean your actions don't have consequences.", "NTA. She played stupid games and now she wins stupid prizes.", "NTA - The other 2 strikes are not your fault or your business or anything to feel guilty of. She got herself into that mess. The fact that she told your partner you were 'cheating' when you are innocent is completely disgraceful. \n\nBefore she did this, you were as good as you could be to her, you even complied with some of the demands she had no right to make just because you are a good neighbour. Even after that she didn't see that you were kind to her and still chose to ruin your life with your girlfriend so please don't go feeling sorry for her. Judging from her past behaviour and lack of acknowledging how you have tried to make it comfortable with her, I'm sure she will still be ungrateful even if you withdraw your complaint to help her. It's up to you what you want to do but I think it would be unwise to withdraw your complaint. Let her sort her living situation by herself.", "Oh. So she might get evicted. Well, sucks for her. \n\nWhen she is actively being moved out, I would sit in my front stoop and drink a beer and watch. Good riddance. \n\nYou have been putting up with her for two years.

She knew the rules and what was at stake. Instead of behaving herself, she continued to be a rude, invasive person trying to micromanage everyone around her. You did nothing wrong - you were only the most recent complaint on the list of people who were being harassed by her. You did not do this to her, she did this to herself. If you hadn't complained, someone else would have sooner or later.", "NTA. I'm 64, and it seems like older people tend to go two ways. They either become bitter or become more mellow. Your neighbor has become a bitter old lady. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  You didn't know it could be her third strike, and honestly that shouldn't be part of your concern.  Your neighbor harasses you and other people.  Who in their right mind goes and looks in a neighbor's bin to see how much waste/recycling they put out that week?\n\nYou deserve to live in peace. Helen is 63, she is not incapacitated.  She can work with the council to find other housing.", "NTA and the fact your the third person to file a complaint shows she is a nuisance to everyone.\n\nIt's sounds like she is this nosy and overbearing to a lot of people.\n\nThe neighborhood has spoken and it is not an asshole.  This sounds like it was a long time coming.", "NTA. Neighbor is the pain in the patootie and you are feeling guilty for reporting her loathsome behavior. Don\u2019t feel guilty. The nail in the coffin to me is how she is now harassing you over the complaint instead of apologizing and promising to do better. She is such a piece of work that you should be happy you\u2019ve been the catalyst for others in the world to get to enjoy her cray-cray. This is not something you want to horde for yourself.", "INFO: did you make a complaint on homophobia grounds? it seems like since the complaints and harassment intensified after your girlfriend moved in and it was clear you were a couple that might have been justified. \n\nregardless, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s probably good that you didn\u2019t know since you are thinking you should have suffered to protect her from her own actions.

It\u2019s sad, but completely unacceptable to bring that negativity down on others. Even if you had done everything possible to appease her, she will always find something else. Like you\u2019ve experienced with the tree. She brought this on herself, she will continue you to bring it on herself, and nothing you can do will change her. She had two strikes already, which means it was only a matter of time before she got her third strike. IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY, is what I\u2019m trying to say. Yes, it would have been nice if it was filed by someone else, that way you could feel guilt free and a problem was resolved, but we can\u2019t always go through life without taking an action in response to someone else making your life miserable.

Respectfully, so what? I can't believe that the council would try to boot a long term tenant because you have a disagreement about dust on a pathway, or that she thinks your parties are too loud. Three strikes such as, \"The tenant's house is in a constant state of disrepair,\" or, \"The tenant leaves garbage outside and attracts vermin to the community,\" or \"The tenant is regularly blasting her music at 3 in the morning,\" may be cause for a case for an eviction.

That\u2019s not your problem, though. You did the right thing because she\u2019s harassing you.", "Nta.  She deserved it", "NTA boot her to the curb", "nta\u2014it sounds like you had no way of knowing about the first two strikes, and regardless you\u2019re not responsible for the consequences of her behavior, particularly when it\u2019s directly impacting you.", "NTA, but you need to report her again. She needs to understand that her own actions caused this and continue to cause this, and she will not get away with it. If she keeps it up, she won't find anyone that will rent to her.", "NTA.  Her actions speak for the kind of person she is, she did it to herself.  If it wasn't you, it would have been someone else.  Do NOT feel bad for her.", "NTA. She fucked around and found out.", "op=NTA\n\nShe's trying to destroy your relationship.  That gets no forgiveness in my mind.\n\nif it were only you who she was trying to annoy/destroy then you would have been the \"first strike\" not the third and she'd be \"fine\".  She has created her own problems.", "NTA \n\nI know you feel badly for her, which makes you such a kind soul. However, she is an adult who has no concept of boundaries, which has gotten her into trouble. I would not have been anywhere near as patient with this woman as you have been, especially if it came to trying to come between my SO and I. She can be a nosy, judgmental busybody but she crossed the line when she made her crazy everyone else\u2019s problem.", "TIL that 10 gentlemen = 3 elderly French men.\n\n\nI am not sure what that means.", "NTA. Being older doesn\u2019t excuse straight up bad unneighbor-like behavior. Maybe this would be a good time for her to find a cheaper place out in the country. Since frankly it would probably be better for everyone, herself included, if she just lived around no one at all.\n\nShe\u2019s a busybody who wants to run the whole block. Boo boo. She\u2019s had 60 years to learn to behave herself, too bad someone\u2019s finally doing something about it.", "Daily harassment for two years would add up to 730 strikes, she's lucky she got to stay in the house as long as she did.", "It\u2019s not \u201cshe was mean to me a little bit\u201d it\u2019s \u201cshe has been harassing me on a daily basis at least once a day for 6 months, and on a weekly basis for a year before that\u201d. I have been literally told that my complaint is the last strike for her by the council, so my complaint did in fact have a lot of weight. I said that in the post. I didn\u2019t intend for that to happen at all, but it\u2019s what happened.", "Thank you!", "I did wonder if she got notified about her previous complaints, or if the council just kind of stockpile them and then once it hits 3 you\u2019re out and that\u2019s why she\u2019s so upset over it but it seems like maybe that\u2019s not the case.", "OP, I suspect if you in any way thought there was a direct way to address this, that she would have listened or responded to, you would have tried it.\n\nYou're having the guilties because you wanted someone with authority to TALK to her, not force her out...\nBut you aren't in charge of the clearly laid out consequences, and whether she took heed the first two times someone in authority talked to her about it.\n\nDespite how you feel, you are absolutely NTA.", "I'll tell you who knew about her two previous complaints. She did. Easiest thing in the world for her to simply keep her mouth shut for once. She didn't, but that's not on you.", "You\u2019re a good person for thinking that, but I wonder how many other good people have been silenced because they knew. With this behavior I highly doubt this was the third time someone wanted to complain. Also, does the board vet complaints? I would bet money it has to be three complaints with merit. NTA.", "Honestly, the moment they decided to tell a lie about you cheating, a line was crossed that made a complaint obligatory instead of a choice. They went from complaining about petty thing to trying to ruin your relationship with your GF. If they tried it once, they\u2019ve either done before or will do it again. Think of this more as a menace to the neighborhood getting all of the past receipts called in", "Tell her if she keeps it up you'll report her to the council and the cops and she'll end up with an ASBO and even the council won't house her. She's in her 60's, that's not old and she's being a major pain, if her actions result in crappy consequences that's her own problem.", "Why? This woman has made the choice, repeatedly, to insert herself into her neighbors' business, to be obnoxious in her dealings with neighbors who are nice to her, and to generally be the neighbor from hell. If you hadn't made the third complaint someone else would have. NTA - and your complaint has probably spared anyone else any more harassment from a person who evidently harasses as a hobby.", "How could you have handled this differently?  \nYou have made yourself feel like you have done something wrong by reporting her behavior. But you deserve peace and quiet in your life just the same as some 60 year old. She harassed you and your neighbors relentlessly and she has/or will pay the price. Don't feel guilty that her actions have come home to roost.", "NTA not your fault, it\u2019s entirely her own fault.  She Is using guilt to manipulate you (and other nice people) and to get away with her terrible behavior.  Too bad she didn\u2019t have better faster consequences.\n\nBut also, what other options do you have?  Move out?  Then she wins / you pay the consequences for her bad behavior.", "I wouldn't doubt if the first two stikes were from other people who, like you, tried to let things slide until push came to shove. It sounds like she surpassed her three strikes alone with what she did to so. I can't imagine what else she did to others. Being old doesn't mean you can break the rules and treat others like crap. NTA. Enjoy the respite when she's gone.", "Fuck that, get this harpy out of your hair. To hell with her", "Why, exactly?\nThat policy is there for a reason. She's making people absolutely miserable. She can move and hopefully learn her lesson.\n\nDon't feel bad about this. It's absolutely not your fault.", "Is still not on you. It's entirely on Helen for being a miserable neighbor. She deserves the consequences of her behavior, which she obviously has been doing for years.", "She's being even more hostile after you reported her. Knowing it is her third report, and she's in trouble. This is not a person who will respond to reason. All you would have done is drive yourself crazy for longer trying to find a solution. This isn't on you, and the reason you feel bad is you are a reasonable person trying to apply it to someone without it.", "Why is her behavior and the consequences of such your responsibility? She\u2019s the one harassing what sounds like EVERYBODY.", "But did you and your gf make up tho?", "Don\u2019t beat yourself up. She did this to herself and you and your gf deserve to feel comfortable where you live. You gave her endless opportunities to stop the behavior. She chose to continue knowing she has strikes against her. NTA and I wouldn\u2019t stress another second on it.", "NTA here. She\u2019s the problem not you.", "Handling it any differently is enabling the behavior. You\u2019re gonna feel guilty but it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong.", "This woman is being outright homophobic and you really think that not saying anything because she has already harassed two other neighbors is the right call? \n\nShe's not upset because your girlfriend temporarily gets dirt on the path. She didn't really see 3 elderly men enter your house and 'accidentally' tell your girlfriend that it was 10 gentleman callers ... she's a cranky old lady who saw two women in a relationship and decided to harass them for it nearly daily. Then she saw an opportunity to try to ruin their relationship and intentionally misrepresented the situation.", "> I didn\u2019t mean for her to be evicted, though.\n\nWho cares, though? This insufferable individual, this beacon of negativity, is clearly never going to change and you're not missing anything by getting her evicted. Literally all of this is her own doing.", "Helen sounds like she needs a hobby.", "She would have been informed by the housing officer. It serves two purposes as it informs the tenant that an official complaint has been made and followed up on, and it gives the tenant the opportunity to rectify their behaviour. It sounds over the top to put it this way but...she's engaging in antisocial behaviour, councils try not to let that kind of crap get out of hand in areas under their control.", "Or even the second to realise she's on  thin ice. She's effed up, not op. \n\nCongratulations on your dissertation. Hope it was a success!", "[removed]", "Yeah. If it wasn\u2019t you it would have been someone else. She had ample opportunity to learn and correct her behaviour by being given multiple chances. Short of her being literally senile Old people CAN change their behaviours, I\u2019ve witnessed it both with my grandparents and with my former 99 year old neighbour (RIP dude, you were the best), some just choose not to. That\u2019s not on you.", "Yes, I think that that is why I feel so guilty. I have tried talking to her directly in the past a few times but it didn\u2019t seem to have made much of a difference.", "I believe there is a vetting process for the complaints, yeah. I\u2019m not entirely sure what it is but I think in my case they checked with my landlord to make sure I wasn\u2019t in arrears for rent and basically made sure I\u2019m a tenant in good standing.", "He was harassing you", "Yeah here\u2019s the comment the above poster paraphrased.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129kzcq/comment/jenpoue/", "I\u2019m 61 and if anything, I have gotten kinder as time has passed because getting angry makes it a me problem and I don\u2019t need self induced anger. And I certainly don\u2019t consider myself old.", "You feel guilty because you're a compassionate human.\nIt's hard to wrap your head around other folks just not getting it, and genuine communication just not working.\n\nI hope you always have this quality. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79"]}
