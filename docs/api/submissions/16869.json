{"id": 16869, "submission_id": "13dh180", "title": "AITA for unintentionally ruining my coworkers wedding proposal?", "selftext": "I (29m), work overnights unloading supply trucks for a major hardware retailer in the US. My coworker John (25m) and his girlfriend Nancy (26f), fake names, have been with the company for about three years now. John works overnights with me and his GF works as a morning department manager, so they often see each other as we\u2019re leaving and she\u2019s coming in. I have become good friends with both of them and we even hang out outside of work, playing video games, going to Top Golf, etc. \n\nNancy has never been one for excessive makeup or jewelry and has stated on more than one occasion she prefers simple earrings and lipstick as her go to. John told me last week that he plans on proposing to Nancy this upcoming weekend on her birthday and showed me a picture of the custom engagement ring he ordered. It\u2019s their birthstones (garnet and emerald) inside of an infinity symbol, it\u2019s super adorable. \n\nNow to the issue; John was off work last night. As I was leaving at 5:30am, I passed by Nancy who had her phone to her face and I caught a glimpse of a ring on her finger that bore a resemblance to the one John had shown me and I made the comment \u201clooks like he couldn\u2019t wait to pop the question\u201d and laughed a bit. She put her phone down, and kinda looked around for a second before replying \u201cpopped a question to ME?\u201d In a confused tone. I kinda stared at her for a second before looking at the ring again and realized it only had her birthstone and wasn\u2019t the one John had shown me.\n\nI tried to back track but she pushed asking \u201cwho popped what question?\u201d I kinda rushed out of the building without replying and hoped she\u2019d forget about it. Well, she must\u2019ve put something together in her head because an hour later I got a call from John who yelled at me, accusing me of ruining his proposal. I tried to explain that I\u2019ve never seen her wear a ring in the three years I\u2019ve known them and suddenly she had one on her ring finger that bore a semblance to the one he showed me at a glance. He wasn\u2019t having it.\n\nI feel terrible about opening my mouth and I\u2019m scared to go to work tonight because John will be there and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be upset with me. So, AITA for accidentally revealing my coworkers plan to propose to his GF?\n\nEdit: I did try sincerely apologizing to John when he called to yell at me but he just kept getting angrier and wasn\u2019t listening to what I was saying. Also (and yes I\u2019m stupid) I didn\u2019t know there was a difference between left and right hand for rings, I just knew the ring finger.

It's understandable that you made the assumption that Nancy was wearing the ring John had shown you, especially since she had never worn a ring before. However, it's important to acknowledge that your comment did cause some confusion and may have led to John's plans being revealed earlier than he intended.\r  \n\r  \nIn the future, it might be best to avoid making assumptions about people's personal lives or plans, especially if it's not something they have explicitly shared with you. That being said, it's clear that you feel bad about what happened and you should apologize to John for any unintended consequences of your comment.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, I would say NAH, but it's important to take this as a lesson on being more cautious with your words in the future.", "NAH\n\nYou made a mistake. But you did ruin the surprise.", "NAH. Or ESH? Why did she run to her future fianc\u00e9 instead of waiting for the surprise herself? Not saying she did anything wrong. But if it were me I wouldn\u2019t have ruined it for my boyfriend like that. I would just keep my lips sealed and maybe tell that story later on when they can all actually laugh at it", "YTA inadvertently.  You pretty much ruined a once in a lifetime event.  Total accident.  But so was Chernobyl.", "Soft YTA. You did not mean to ruin the surprise , it was an honest mistake but you could have handled it better after you realised you messed up. How you handled the situation afterwards is what makes you a bit of an asshole.", "NAH as you didn\u2019t mean to ruin the proposal. It was an honest mistake. Next time you\u2019re in this situation just let them give you the good news first to avoid spoiling it.", "INFO: Have you given them a sincere apology? Your post doesn't mention that, it just says that you basically told John it was reasonable to assume she was wearing an engagement ring after getting \"a glimpse\" of a ring on her finger because it reminded you of the engagement ring and she doesn't normally wear rings.\n\nYTA if you haven't sincerely apologized.\nNAH if you have. Your co-worker's anger is understandable but what you did wasn't malicious, it was a dumb mistake.", "YTA, if you know someone is planning to pop the question then you should never be the one to instigate the topic with the proposal recipient", "YTA it's kind of like asking someone if they're pregnant. Wait until she tells you she's engaged and then offer congratulations.", "YTA but youre not an asshole...if that makes sense.  \nIt was a mistake; you probably shouldn't have said anything anyway. But many many people would have made the same mistake.", "NAH as long as it was on her left ring finger. Any other finger and YTA", "You\u2019re not an asshole as you didn\u2019t do it with ill intent you know butttt a bit of a mess up there for sure. Just a sucky situation. Just remind your friend that you didn\u2019t technically tell her. Maybe one day they\u2019ll laugh about it- don\u2019t beat yourself up about it too much!", "NTA. Unintentional, but unfortunately messed up a huge surprise that would have been a very special memory. All you can do is apologize profusely and give them time to forgive you. Maybe an opportunity will come up or you\u2019ll think of something special you can surprise them with in the future. If they make it to the altar and you\u2019re still friends, prepare to be roasted in the best man\u2019s toast.", "NTA because it wasn't intentional, but man did you mess up. Just take responsibility and apologize to John; it's the only thing you can do at this point. If you were gonna avoid the situation, you needed to be quicker on your feet when she was first questioning you.", "Nta. Honest accident", "NAH. honest mistake.\n\nReach out to John, explain what happened, and apologize sincerely.", "NAH the ring sounds kinda ugly", "You know that YTA, and that's why you feel bad about it. Hopefully John forgives you. It sounds like you made an honest mistake.", "NTA you made a mistake and assumed she was wearing a ring on her ring finger because John had proposed. Fair enough assumption.\n\nJohn wasn't an asshole for going off on you either as you have accidentally ruined his plans to some degree.", "YTA. Just keep quiet. Let her tell you about the proposal when it happens. People need to just shut up.", "YTA. You done fucked up good this time. What other possible judgment could there be? No one told you to say anything. You can\u2019t fix it. Stop apologizing. Give your friend some space.", "Think i gotta go NAH on this one, it was obviously an honest mistake and yeah maybe you could've tried to play your comment to Nancy off as a joke or something but like you panicked and honestly i would have panicked too so it is what it is. As for John's part if someone ruined my proposal, accidentally or not, i would probably yell at them too so... Again it is what it is, hopefully you can talk this out with him tonight and work things out !", "NAH, sounds like a genuine mistake on your part; John should remember that the proposal is a tiny part of the whole process and eventually they will laugh about how you proposed to her for him", "NTA. It's a honest mistake and even he's understandably upset, he's taking this too far. No need to be so rude with you.", "NTA. He shouldn't talk about his proposal to colleagues, nor should he call and yell at you.", "NTA - You're just a man lol and a good one by the sounds but yeah maybe learn to wait until the information is given before assuming... and also, soft she's the AH for dropping you in it she must have known by the look on your face that you f'd it up by accident", "Not TA.

You didn't do this maliciously but it was still your fault and avoidable. If you want to apologize sincerely you need to say that you know you fucked up by making a dumb assumption, it wasn't intentional and you feel terrible that you ruined the surprise. Leave it at that, don't try to make him understand your reasoning again.", "Lol I\u2019m sorry this isn\u2019t funny but it kind of is. What a mistake. Whoopsie! Given how important proposals are to some people, I would send flowers to the fianc\u00e9 with a note apologizing for ruining John\u2019s carefully planned proposal by mistake. Send them to Nancy not to John even though he\u2019s the one you technically screwed over. This whole thing matters to him because he wanted to impress Nancy. In all likelihood they\u2019ll appreciate the gesture and it will drive home the point that you realize this wasn\u2019t a small mistake, but it also wasn\u2019t intentional and you\u2019re truly sorry you spoiled the surprise. A simple apology isn\u2019t enough in this situation, you need a gesture and a gesture like flowers. If you offered to take them to Top Golf or something and pay that\u2019s not entirely selfless because you\u2019d have fun too and get something out of it. So pick flowers or an edible arrangement or whatever you think would float their boats and do that."]}
