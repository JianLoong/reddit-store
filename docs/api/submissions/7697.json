She basically interviews them, and I feel like she isn't taking it seriously", "selftext": "My girlfriend is at a job she can't do remotely, and we're planning to move to another state together, so she's job hunting right now. \n\nHer first interview, she had a call with a top company who's recruiter had messaged her on LinkedIn. I was expecting her to treat it normally, but she spent an hour grilling the company on its engineering practices then withdrew her application.\n\nAnd the next few calls with companies she had, she basically grilled them all and decided against moving forward with four of the six. \n\nI told her around then, that I feel like she's making a mistake, being so picky, and she's gonna ruin her reputation in the industry if she's going around taking interviews and cutting the process off early.\n\nShe said she wasn't making any enemies, hell, the companies she dropped had been emailing and calling constantly, wanting to bring her in for another interview or asking her to reconsider. If anything, she was a hotter commodity.\n\nI felt like she was probably still hurting her reputation long term, even if her little power play was working for a bit. \n\nShe said it wasn't a power play, it was professional, she just didn't want to waste anyone's time. \n\nBut the next interview I overheard started a big argument. One of her final two companies had her taking a Zoom interview and she was laughing it up with an interviewer and he was telling her this story about how he and his coworkers fell off a barge into the river working on a project. And she just was like \"waiiit they had y'all doing that, not tied off to anything? Look as funny as that is, that's honestly kind of fucked up they put y'all in danger like that - I'm honestly gonna have to withdraw my application\" \n\nShe got off the phone and said \"Damn, people really tell on themselves if you just listen and smile, did you hear that shit?\" And I said that I thought she ended it a little prematurely, like didn't even ask if they'd changed anything there, just ended the call. \n\nI said it felt like she was trying to delay getting a new job, was she getting cold feet or something? \n\nShe said no, this is literally how people at her level interview, she was serious about the interview process and she wasn't interested in walking into a shitshow.\n\nI said that was BS, she was sabotaging herself on purpose basically haranguing the companies who want to hire her on the phone. And she was like \"why do they keep coming back for more then? Like I'm critical but I'm not wrong and they know it.\" \n\nWe had this big fight where she insisted that anyone wo was at her level of a career \"interviewed\" by interviewing companies to see whether they were worth their time, just as much as the other way around, and I said that was BS. She got mad I was telling her about her own career and said she knew it better \n\nAITA for arguing with my girlfriend about her interviews? I feel like she's dragging her feet, she says she's interviewing normally for her field.", "created_utc": 1674091738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10foo7y/aita_for_criticizing_how_my_girlfriend_takes_job/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sadly a lot of people don't do it and it is even more common for women to not do it.  \n\nI suggest you stop listening to her interviews completely and please absolutely get out of the house and be miles away when she gets to the salary negotiation step.  I don't think you will be able to cope with that and stay silent.", "YTA do you work in her field at her level? If not mind your business.

A job interview is the perfect time for a candidate to interrogate the people at the company. If you're not asking questions you're doing yourself a disservice.

Maybe a few decades ago but not anymore. Interviewing is a two way street.

Why are you trying to put her down?", "YTA.  Seriously, this is how it is for engineering and consulting firms.  Your GF has high standards for ethics and safety and isn't willing to compromise.

That means coming prepared with questions about the day to day, what their work means to them, pitfalls they have, etc. I have turned down roles after two or three interviews in a day panel because of people I interviewed with. I\u2019ve seen people who were junior jump into a role cause it was the first offer they got only to realize that it was a terrible fit and in most cases they had to go through a review cycle (with a negative review, mind you) before they could even attempt to transfer to another team within the company.\n\nYour girlfriend is doing this right.

My husband interviews like this, and at first I was shocked listening to his interview calls.

He wants to make sure the company's goals are achievable so he and the company can succeed. He definitely grills the company.\n\nAs a woman, I can't be quite as \"bold\" in my interviewing style, but I certainly have learned to ask a lot more discerning questions, to avoid the exploitative work environments that I've been in before, and make sure it's a good fit for me.", "YTA.

It looks like your girlfriend is at a high enough level to be that candid. She knows her stuff and woe is the recruiter who talks to her without knowing it.

I was expecting her to treat it normally, but she spent an hour grilling the company on its engineering practices then withdrew her application.\n\nAnd the next few calls with companies she had, she basically grilled them all and decided against moving forward with four of the six. \n\nI told her around then, that I feel like she's making a mistake, being so picky, and she's gonna ruin her reputation in the industry if she's going around taking interviews and cutting the process off early.\n\nShe said she wasn't making any enemies, hell, the companies she dropped had been emailing and calling constantly, wanting to bring her in for another interview or asking them to reconsider. If anything, she was a hotter commodity.\n\nI felt like she was probably still hurting her reputation long term, even if her little power play was working for a bit. \n\nShe said it wasn't a power play, it was professional, she just didn't want to waste anyone's time. \n\nBut the next interview I overheard started a big argument. One of her final two companies had her taking a Zoom interview and she was laughing it up with an interviewer and he was telling her this story about how he and his coworkers fell off a barge into the river working on a project. And she just was like \"waiiit they had y'all doing that, not tied off to anything? Look as funny as that is, that's honestly kind of fucked up they put y'all in danger like that - I'm honestly gonna have to withdraw my application\" \n\nShe got off the phone and said \"Damn, people really tell on themselves if you just listen and smile, did you hear that shit?\" And I said that I thought she ended it a little prematurely, like didn't even ask if they'd changed anything there, just ended the call. \n\nI said it felt like she was trying to delay getting a new job, was she getting cold feet or something? \n\nShe said no, this is literally how people at her level interview, she was serious about the interview process and she wasn't interested in walking into a shitshow.\n\nI said that was BS, she was sabotaging herself on purpose basically haranguing the companies who want to hire her on the phone. And she was like \"why do they keep coming back for more then? Like I'm critical but I'm not wrong and they know it.\" \n\nWe had this big fight where she insisted that anyone wo was at her level of a career \"interviewed\" by interviewing companies to see whether they were worth their time, just as much as the other way around, and I said that was BS. She got mad I was telling her about her own career and said she knew it better \n\nAITA for arguing with my girlfriend about her interviews? I feel like she's dragging her feet, she says she's interviewing normally for her field.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It really seems your girlfriend is significantly more senior than you, and has figured out the part you haven\u2019t yet.", "YTA! I wouldn\u2019t work for a company that didn\u2019t treat my safety as a top priority. And you need to be on the lookout for a cultural fit, especially as a woman! I am impressed she knows her worth and knows when to pull the plug. Interviews are a two way street! Just as a company can end your interview process at any time, so can the applicant.", "Most people aren't brave enough to interview like they, but it sounds like OP's gf isn't timid and knows her worth in the industry.\n\nPlus, you know, who would want to work for a company that doesn't do safety right? Between \"barges\" and \"engineering\", there aren't that many fields his gf could be in. And in all the ones I can think of, you can get killed or horribly maimed if you don't follow safety regulations.", "I wouldn\u2019t be quite a blunt as she has been. But I\u2019m at that stage in my career, I repeatedly get head hunted all the time. I will not work somewhere that\u2019s isn\u2019t a good fit. I spend more time there than anywhere but my bed in a week and if I\u2019m not happy there it means I will leave quickly. \n\nAnd yep people will tell on themselves. I won\u2019t work in toxic or unsafe environments and it sounds like she\u2019s not even being overly picky just eliminating on normal criteria.", "The job field isn't even relevant. This is how literally any real professional would tell you to interview. Just because op doesn't know how to interview, doesn't mean his gf has cold feet lol", "Came here to say exactly this.  Mansplaining is so wrong!  OP YTA for certain.", "Hi! I am a recruiter (and a woman if that matters). I only recruit executives (vp level to c-suite, the occasional board position) and her behavior would be a red flag and I would certainly never contact her again for another position if I received feedback like that from a client about how she interviewed. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with asking probing, challenging questions\u2026..quite the opposite actually, that\u2019s a very positive sign that the person is engaged and thinks strategically.  But there is a way to handle it when you don\u2019t like the answers\u2026.shutting down the interview and saying it\u2019s not for you is NOT IT. If she had concerns about what was said, then it\u2019s on her to either a) share that with the recruiter in a private conversation which the recruiter will then nicely communicate to the client or b) send a note or have a phone call with the client and telling them they are backing out of a hiring process and sharing the why if asked directly. \n\nIt shows a level of immaturity as well as unfamiliarity with how the recruiting game works at a high level. There is nothing wrong with backing out of a process, but being rude, combative, and ending the call unceremoniously is not respectful or mature. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what industry she is in but in ANY industry, this would not fly at a vp level and above. Maybe she is director level or lower and speaking with an HR manager rather than a CEO or board member in which case, I hope she grows out of this bad habit because it certainly will give you a bad name.", "\ud83d\udcaf her next job she will be accepting while single.", "Can you tell me what questions you should be asking? I've always said i had none and thats probably why i haven't been able to get a job in over a year \ud83d\ude29", "TBH she has told me she really likes her current job but also does want to move and is planning to find another. But she's also said it's set a really high bar, and that she's holding out to find something that's not a step back in her career", "Or a 19 year old afraid of their boss\u2026", "? This is standard behavior if you are in demand. My friends have been able to do it in tech especially but I have a bit of it in senior roles in corporate marketing. You are able to choose and you are able to step away. Sometimes this leads to bigger offers because they chase you. She knows what she is doing.", "I don't think this is true, I think he explained his concern pretty well. He's worried that she isn't taking the job hunting seriously and they either aren't gonna move or he's gonna end up completely supporting her. If she really is high up in her field openings do not pop up that often so if she, at the point of this post, has shut down all but one it's very reasonable for him to be upset about it. Even if in her head she is thinking worst case scenario she'll just go back to one of the previous ones there's no guarantee the position is still open. \n\nIf I was planning on moving with someone soon and they shut down that many jobs I would be pissed/stressed about things working out regarding the move.", "Considering shes looking for work from home, pretty sure she will be safe.", "You should definitely be asking questions at the end of an interview if you are still interested in getting an offer. \u2018How would you describe the culture\u2019 \u2018can you tell me a little more about the team I\u2019d be working with\u2019 \u2018what are the most important projects or tasks I would be working on?\u2019 are all good questions to ask. \n\nAsk a Manager has some good articles about this topic. https://www.askamanager.org/2023/01/10-impressive-questions-to-ask-in-a-job-interview.html", "Butting in, because advice.\n\nResearch the job postings, the skills involved, the position just above them, and the company you're interviewing for.\n\nAsk about the role, and its potential.  Ask clarifying questions about how it fits in with the rest of the roles that interact with it.  Follow up on the company's mission statements or public policy.\n\nIt will be different for every role and every company.  Try to see a path, a circle of influence, etc.  All rippling out from your position.", "So she\u2019s moving for you?\nWhy you moving for you mean she goes backwards career wise?\nIf sounds like she is further along in her career than you, is that true? Why are you moving?", "This makes total sense. I would not want to trade down, either.", "Why are you spying on her interviews?", "YTA for wanting her to take a step back in her career. Why would you kneecap her?", "And are you qualified enough in HER field to tell HER how to manage HER career?", "It sounds to me, she is trying to tell you, what she thinks you want to hear, but deep down, she wants to stay. Are you pressurizing her, to work from home?", "You make some good points, but in that case, OP needs to have a better conversation with her about his worries instead of just \"you're doing interviews wrong.\" She clearly knows what she is doing if she's still getting calls back from ppl she's rejected, so why can't he ask her why she's doing what she's doing and what her thought process is? \n\nIt sounds like she works in a dangerous field where ppl are at risk of becoming seriously injured or losing their lives. Some employees fell into a river?! It sounds like she's rigorously testing their regulations, safety measures, etc. to make sure they're a safe, reliable company that's not going to cause any liability issues down the road. If an employee loses their life or suffers a severe workplace accident bc the company wasn't up to code, that can cause serious issues for her. She may be looking at which company is better for the long term instead of just accepting whichever is better for right now. In which case, yeah, it is better for her to reject a company that has horrible regulations.", "We live in a 1 bedroom apartment..", "Or she's willing to move, but only when and if she finds a job she thinks she can enjoy as much as her current one. OP sounds like he expects her to just take anything to accommodate his desire to move.", "Shouldn't she say that if that's the case?", "Even so, go out for coffee while she has an interview. She interviewed successfully for years without your watchful eye, and it seems she\u2019s done well for herself. Leave her professional life alone unless she asks for help.", "So go take a walk. Get a coffee. Get a beer. Visit a friend. Go to the library. There are endless possibilities other than being nosy and critical.", "So do I, but I don\u2019t listen in on my fianc\u00e9s work if we are both working from home that day. I turn up the volume on my headphones or zone out. Super weird."]}
