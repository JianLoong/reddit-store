She basically interviews them, and I feel like she isn't taking it seriously", "selftext": "My girlfriend is at a job she can't do remotely, and we're planning to move to another state together, so she's job hunting right now. \n\nHer first interview, she had a call with a top company who's recruiter had messaged her on LinkedIn. I was expecting her to treat it normally, but she spent an hour grilling the company on its engineering practices then withdrew her application.\n\nAnd the next few calls with companies she had, she basically grilled them all and decided against moving forward with four of the six. \n\nI told her around then, that I feel like she's making a mistake, being so picky, and she's gonna ruin her reputation in the industry if she's going around taking interviews and cutting the process off early.\n\nShe said she wasn't making any enemies, hell, the companies she dropped had been emailing and calling constantly, wanting to bring her in for another interview or asking her to reconsider. If anything, she was a hotter commodity.\n\nI felt like she was probably still hurting her reputation long term, even if her little power play was working for a bit. \n\nShe said it wasn't a power play, it was professional, she just didn't want to waste anyone's time. \n\nBut the next interview I overheard started a big argument. One of her final two companies had her taking a Zoom interview and she was laughing it up with an interviewer and he was telling her this story about how he and his coworkers fell off a barge into the river working on a project. And she just was like \"waiiit they had y'all doing that, not tied off to anything? Look as funny as that is, that's honestly kind of fucked up they put y'all in danger like that - I'm honestly gonna have to withdraw my application\" \n\nShe got off the phone and said \"Damn, people really tell on themselves if you just listen and smile, did you hear that shit?\" And I said that I thought she ended it a little prematurely, like didn't even ask if they'd changed anything there, just ended the call. \n\nI said it felt like she was trying to delay getting a new job, was she getting cold feet or something? \n\nShe said no, this is literally how people at her level interview, she was serious about the interview process and she wasn't interested in walking into a shitshow.\n\nI said that was BS, she was sabotaging herself on purpose basically haranguing the companies who want to hire her on the phone. And she was like \"why do they keep coming back for more then? Like I'm critical but I'm not wrong and they know it.\" \n\nWe had this big fight where she insisted that anyone wo was at her level of a career \"interviewed\" by interviewing companies to see whether they were worth their time, just as much as the other way around, and I said that was BS. She got mad I was telling her about her own career and said she knew it better \n\nAITA for arguing with my girlfriend about her interviews? I feel like she's dragging her feet, she says she's interviewing normally for her field.", "created_utc": 1674091738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10foo7y/aita_for_criticizing_how_my_girlfriend_takes_job/", "score": 2696, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sadly a lot of people don't do it and it is even more common for women to not do it.  \n\nI suggest you stop listening to her interviews completely and please absolutely get out of the house and be miles away when she gets to the salary negotiation step.  I don't think you will be able to cope with that and stay silent.", "YTA do you work in her field at her level? If not mind your business.

A job interview is the perfect time for a candidate to interrogate the people at the company. If you're not asking questions you're doing yourself a disservice.

Maybe a few decades ago but not anymore. Interviewing is a two way street.

That means coming prepared with questions about the day to day, what their work means to them, pitfalls they have, etc. I have turned down roles after two or three interviews in a day panel because of people I interviewed with. I\u2019ve seen people who were junior jump into a role cause it was the first offer they got only to realize that it was a terrible fit and in most cases they had to go through a review cycle (with a negative review, mind you) before they could even attempt to transfer to another team within the company.\n\nYour girlfriend is doing this right.

My husband interviews like this, and at first I was shocked listening to his interview calls.

He wants to make sure the company's goals are achievable so he and the company can succeed. He definitely grills the company.\n\nAs a woman, I can't be quite as \"bold\" in my interviewing style, but I certainly have learned to ask a lot more discerning questions, to avoid the exploitative work environments that I've been in before, and make sure it's a good fit for me.", "YTA.

It looks like your girlfriend is at a high enough level to be that candid. She knows her stuff and woe is the recruiter who talks to her without knowing it.

I was expecting her to treat it normally, but she spent an hour grilling the company on its engineering practices then withdrew her application.\n\nAnd the next few calls with companies she had, she basically grilled them all and decided against moving forward with four of the six. \n\nI told her around then, that I feel like she's making a mistake, being so picky, and she's gonna ruin her reputation in the industry if she's going around taking interviews and cutting the process off early.\n\nShe said she wasn't making any enemies, hell, the companies she dropped had been emailing and calling constantly, wanting to bring her in for another interview or asking them to reconsider. If anything, she was a hotter commodity.\n\nI felt like she was probably still hurting her reputation long term, even if her little power play was working for a bit. \n\nShe said it wasn't a power play, it was professional, she just didn't want to waste anyone's time. \n\nBut the next interview I overheard started a big argument. One of her final two companies had her taking a Zoom interview and she was laughing it up with an interviewer and he was telling her this story about how he and his coworkers fell off a barge into the river working on a project. And she just was like \"waiiit they had y'all doing that, not tied off to anything? Look as funny as that is, that's honestly kind of fucked up they put y'all in danger like that - I'm honestly gonna have to withdraw my application\" \n\nShe got off the phone and said \"Damn, people really tell on themselves if you just listen and smile, did you hear that shit?\" And I said that I thought she ended it a little prematurely, like didn't even ask if they'd changed anything there, just ended the call. \n\nI said it felt like she was trying to delay getting a new job, was she getting cold feet or something? \n\nShe said no, this is literally how people at her level interview, she was serious about the interview process and she wasn't interested in walking into a shitshow.\n\nI said that was BS, she was sabotaging herself on purpose basically haranguing the companies who want to hire her on the phone. And she was like \"why do they keep coming back for more then? Like I'm critical but I'm not wrong and they know it.\" \n\nWe had this big fight where she insisted that anyone wo was at her level of a career \"interviewed\" by interviewing companies to see whether they were worth their time, just as much as the other way around, and I said that was BS. She got mad I was telling her about her own career and said she knew it better \n\nAITA for arguing with my girlfriend about her interviews? I feel like she's dragging her feet, she says she's interviewing normally for her field.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Five hours ago, you were TA, but now, you are NTA! Because you have learned and grown. I wish you both the best, success and happiness!", "You're not an asshole. But I assume you are probably wrong. \nI understand your feeling, that your girlfriend is trying to sabotage your plans of moving - it could absolutely be the case.\n\nAlso, it seems like you are just a lot friendlier than your girlfriend and it feels wrong/mean to you, how harshly and brutally she is rejecting people. Maybe it is a shock to you, as she acts a lot sweeter with you than in the professional context. \nHowever, her harshness seems to come from a place of justified moral judgement. \n\nHence, she is being a dick to those interviewers, but the companies they represent are the assholes in this triangle. \nDon't let people tell you that you are the asshole, you are just a peaceful person who doesn't want anybody to get hurt because you assume everyone is as innocent as you.", "OP is pissed off his gf has so many options and can decide where she wants to work vs being forced to take anything offered to her.", "bro has to use \"muh mansplaining\" as an excuse", "Lol I literally called mansplaining out in my comment before reading this. OP has no idea what they're talking about but is out there offering advice and judgement when their girlfriend is getting interviews left and right.", "That's sexist", "I was with you until you went into the mansplaining thing. This isn't even mansplaining. It's one partner settling with a job and another having high standards about where they work. It really could happen to either gender (though in this case it's a safe bet OP was the male given the title).", "Blech. I'm barfing. YTA for stating, \"Yes, I am assuming OPs sex.\" What strange, passive-aggressive weirdness.", "How does this end up being \"mansplaining\"?  How is this suddenly about gender? WTF", "Grr they are a man. Man bad. Grr lol", "How will that information affect your verdict?", "I think you're being downvoted because you're making a lot of assumptions. You don't actually know what questions she asked or didn't ask. You also know actually know what the job she was interviewing for, or what it involved. Saying \"this person does not want to take any responsibility in their life\" because she didn't ask whatever questions you think she should have, is just completely unnecessary.", "Props to you for being able to admit you were wrong and trying to grow yourself as a person.\n\nI say this in the nicest way possible, but there's clearly a reason she's looking at jobs double to quadruple your max salary. \n\nLearn from her. And mostly don't limit yourself. Don't get to just know your field, get to know your company. You can earn far more than you think because a business will pay you what you're worth, you just have to make it known to them that you know how much you're worth.", "> Like I was so caught up in the \"how tf could someone ever reject 2 or 300k from several top companies?\n\nThe flip side of that - if she's in a position to GET OFFERS for 2 or 3 hundred k, twice... she's also in a position to get it two more times, and two more after that. She's had, what, six interviews? She could get six more. These aren't once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that she's turning down (as proven by the fact that she's gone through half a dozen of them already).\n\nThat's why she's able to do this - the very fact that she's able to get all these interviews and then offers is proof that she's got the freedom to be as picky as she wants. And it's doubly true because since she's currently employed, though it would be nice to get a job soon she doesn't have to take the first opportunity that comes her way. .", "Well done, OP! It takes a mature, strong person to ask for feedback, and take it, and admit when they're wrong. I really admire your ability to admit and learn.", "Exactly, I wish I took that approach when I was younger and should I look for a new path now, I'd do the same thing. I don't want to spend my life being miserable working for a company that doesn't fit my needs... and I'm not picky! But working for x amount of companies, you know what's going to be a waste of time and talent vs who's going to value or work with you to do both what's good for the company AND you. \n\nIt's a career, not a survival job, there's a difference. If I ABSOLUTELY need money NOW- I'll take whatever legal job I could and do my best at it, but if I'm looking long term, I'm going to be a little more selective in a field I can be more selective in.", "Not jealous, but out of his depth. OP very level headed though. Great AITA resolution haha.", "The company certainly doesn\u2019t know best. But the company is always the entity you are asking to be hired and payed from.\n\nThat being said, the river accident thing sounded like a reasonable issue she had, wouldn\u2019t want to work for a company with so little regard to the safety of their workers. The engineering practices complaint however - depending what engineering practices she specifically meant - could be equally petty and a sign that she doesn\u2019t really want to leave her current job", "Seriously. I've been interviewing for a couple of months. I usually have as many questions for the interviewers as they have for me, and usually during the interview we both end up coming up with a few more. \n\nI'm not entry level, I'm not interested in walking in to a job blind then walking out a week later because of how much it sucks. If I can't have an hour of conversation with you and learn about my future work environment, I'm not going to like the job, and I'm not going to waste everyone's time", "Yes! I interview like this too, the job needs to fit me as much as I need to fit it. Op is a moron and probably has shit boundaries.", "So many hours of our week are dedicated to work! We need to be in a place that aligns to our values or where we feel comfortable at least. She\u2019s doing the right thing! Looking for a place to work long term", "She should also be applying this technique to the boyfriend.", "I think that is what frustrated a lot of us Gen X because we saw the radical shifts in how interviews were conducted and how companies moved to online applications and resume submissions. No more pounding the pavement as our parents and grandparents had. No more crap of certain ways of women acting for example that were rooted in misogyny.", "It seems to be that he doesn\u2019t see her at the same level as these companies do. It\u2019s almost like OP \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe\u201d that their gf is in such high demand.", "Yes. I used the term mansplaining and then said I assumed OP\u2019s sex based on my use of the term. \n\nYou are right. If you have a different and more apt term for mansplaining that is gender-neutral, I am happy to learn!", "The mansplaining comment was likely referring to the bf insisting he knew how to handle interviews in a field he doesn't work in better than his girlfriend to the point where he was lecturing and fighting with her despite it being her field.", "Yes. Being wrong is never a bad thing if the person can learn and change when corrected.\n\nWell done OP.", "You don't see people accepting the judgement and growing often in this sub, it's incredibly refreshing", "You don't see people accepting the judgement and growing often in this sub, it's incredibly refreshing", "And I can see why she wants him by her side, too. Judging from his response, he\u2019s earnest, open to learning and not afraid to talk about his insecurities. Glad the two of them worked it out.", "Can confirm, I only got my license 3 months ago. Already got an offer for more than a 30% raise", ">you're going to be babysitting everyone there\n\nUgh this is so true and it affects women in STEM so much. We aren't in a position to coast (we'll never be given the benefit of the doubt, every tiny bit of clout has to be hard earned), and it's really easy to fall into a routine of fixing up everyone's sloppy work, _especially_ when their work affects our own, as we can't afford to be dragged down. It's a PITA. You have to be really picky about your team to make sure you're surrounded by people who are on their shit just as much as you are. Otherwise you'll burn out.", "Seems like they deserve each other in the best way possible.", "What kind of questions do you ask?", "But why would stuff getting better frustrate Gen X?", "Yes.  It's a shame for her because it sounds like she knows what she's doing and is very good at her job.", "That's not that crazy. Very few people have the luxury to be that choosy when applying for jobs. If someone is used to shotgunning 20 applications a day just trying to get their foot in the door, walking out of interviews like that can sound pretty wild.", "Condescending is the best I can think of off the top of my head. Eh, but that doesn't really imply the bit where the person doing it doesn't know what the hell they're talking about to the person who does.", ">Plus she turned down a company offering 300k salary and benefits in the first half hour of talking with them. Which tbh, if a job was offering me 300k my only question would be when do I start.\n\nYou are going to fuck yourself over with this mentality.", "It makes sense, though. The kind of quality woman who is that selective about her work isn't going to date just anyone!", "Thank you, this is very helpful!", "I've always heard this as a pretty standard job interview rule. Even if it's something as simple as \"describe an average day at this job\" or \"what sets this company apart from others in the field\"", "A lot of employers still feel that way. But the tide is turning. Especially if you are highly trained, companies should feel lucky they get your expertise.", "In most cases the one who \"lucky to get a job\" usually ended up losing due to horrible treatment on the upper management. \n\nAlso on the interview OP overheard, they sounds like ignoring a lot of safety regulation.", "I\u2019m a woman and do the same. I\u2019m landed about 90> of the jobs I go after\u2026you have to show people that you\u2019re engaged and wanna know what your life at the company would look like. I always ask questions and do something similar. It honestly makes you stand out as a candidate.", "That story that the company told her about falling off a barge is a massive red flag for the company. She was right to reject that company.", "Rejecting the job because some people fell off a barge now makes a ton more sense. She doesn't want to be liable for shit like that.", "As an aerospace engineer in the US this is so not true lmao. PEs typically do civil engineering related items like buildings, large public works, etc. PEs get certified to sign off on builds that will be used by the general public made for the general public among other things.

They don't ask for higher pay!\"  \n  \nBut the problem is, when women do that, they don't get what they were asking for, even when they are worth it.

Switched careers to teaching STEM recently after a move and being outside was definitely a great way to work", "Lol, well I actually switched careers to law so no sun, tar, n concrete for me. \n\nBut to be fair, law is an easier career path than becoming a PE, and the pay is far better. So I'm not complaining. \n\nCongrats on switching to teach STEM. That's actually a career path I would like to take in the future as well. I've actually had some attorneys tell me that they did the same too and really enjoyed it."]}
