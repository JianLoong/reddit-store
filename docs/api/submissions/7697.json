She basically interviews them, and I feel like she isn't taking it seriously", "selftext": "My girlfriend is at a job she can't do remotely, and we're planning to move to another state together, so she's job hunting right now. \n\nHer first interview, she had a call with a top company who's recruiter had messaged her on LinkedIn. I was expecting her to treat it normally, but she spent an hour grilling the company on its engineering practices then withdrew her application.\n\nAnd the next few calls with companies she had, she basically grilled them all and decided against moving forward with four of the six. \n\nI told her around then, that I feel like she's making a mistake, being so picky, and she's gonna ruin her reputation in the industry if she's going around taking interviews and cutting the process off early.\n\nShe said she wasn't making any enemies, hell, the companies she dropped had been emailing and calling constantly, wanting to bring her in for another interview or asking her to reconsider. If anything, she was a hotter commodity.\n\nI felt like she was probably still hurting her reputation long term, even if her little power play was working for a bit. \n\nShe said it wasn't a power play, it was professional, she just didn't want to waste anyone's time. \n\nBut the next interview I overheard started a big argument. One of her final two companies had her taking a Zoom interview and she was laughing it up with an interviewer and he was telling her this story about how he and his coworkers fell off a barge into the river working on a project. And she just was like \"waiiit they had y'all doing that, not tied off to anything? Look as funny as that is, that's honestly kind of fucked up they put y'all in danger like that - I'm honestly gonna have to withdraw my application\" \n\nShe got off the phone and said \"Damn, people really tell on themselves if you just listen and smile, did you hear that shit?\" And I said that I thought she ended it a little prematurely, like didn't even ask if they'd changed anything there, just ended the call. \n\nI said it felt like she was trying to delay getting a new job, was she getting cold feet or something? \n\nShe said no, this is literally how people at her level interview, she was serious about the interview process and she wasn't interested in walking into a shitshow.\n\nI said that was BS, she was sabotaging herself on purpose basically haranguing the companies who want to hire her on the phone. And she was like \"why do they keep coming back for more then? Like I'm critical but I'm not wrong and they know it.\" \n\nWe had this big fight where she insisted that anyone wo was at her level of a career \"interviewed\" by interviewing companies to see whether they were worth their time, just as much as the other way around, and I said that was BS. She got mad I was telling her about her own career and said she knew it better \n\nAITA for arguing with my girlfriend about her interviews? I feel like she's dragging her feet, she says she's interviewing normally for her field.", "created_utc": 1674091738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10foo7y/aita_for_criticizing_how_my_girlfriend_takes_job/", "score": 660, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sadly a lot of people don't do it and it is even more common for women to not do it.  \n\nI suggest you stop listening to her interviews completely and please absolutely get out of the house and be miles away when she gets to the salary negotiation step.  I don't think you will be able to cope with that and stay silent.", "YTA do you work in her field at her level? If not mind your business.

A job interview is the perfect time for a candidate to interrogate the people at the company. If you're not asking questions you're doing yourself a disservice.

Maybe a few decades ago but not anymore. Interviewing is a two way street.

That means coming prepared with questions about the day to day, what their work means to them, pitfalls they have, etc. I have turned down roles after two or three interviews in a day panel because of people I interviewed with. I\u2019ve seen people who were junior jump into a role cause it was the first offer they got only to realize that it was a terrible fit and in most cases they had to go through a review cycle (with a negative review, mind you) before they could even attempt to transfer to another team within the company.\n\nYour girlfriend is doing this right.

My husband interviews like this, and at first I was shocked listening to his interview calls.

He wants to make sure the company's goals are achievable so he and the company can succeed. He definitely grills the company.\n\nAs a woman, I can't be quite as \"bold\" in my interviewing style, but I certainly have learned to ask a lot more discerning questions, to avoid the exploitative work environments that I've been in before, and make sure it's a good fit for me.", "YTA.

It looks like your girlfriend is at a high enough level to be that candid. She knows her stuff and woe is the recruiter who talks to her without knowing it.

That wasn\u2019t just an \u201coopsie\u201d.  They willfully broke OSHA rules.

I was expecting her to treat it normally, but she spent an hour grilling the company on its engineering practices then withdrew her application.\n\nAnd the next few calls with companies she had, she basically grilled them all and decided against moving forward with four of the six. \n\nI told her around then, that I feel like she's making a mistake, being so picky, and she's gonna ruin her reputation in the industry if she's going around taking interviews and cutting the process off early.\n\nShe said she wasn't making any enemies, hell, the companies she dropped had been emailing and calling constantly, wanting to bring her in for another interview or asking them to reconsider. If anything, she was a hotter commodity.\n\nI felt like she was probably still hurting her reputation long term, even if her little power play was working for a bit. \n\nShe said it wasn't a power play, it was professional, she just didn't want to waste anyone's time. \n\nBut the next interview I overheard started a big argument. One of her final two companies had her taking a Zoom interview and she was laughing it up with an interviewer and he was telling her this story about how he and his coworkers fell off a barge into the river working on a project. And she just was like \"waiiit they had y'all doing that, not tied off to anything? Look as funny as that is, that's honestly kind of fucked up they put y'all in danger like that - I'm honestly gonna have to withdraw my application\" \n\nShe got off the phone and said \"Damn, people really tell on themselves if you just listen and smile, did you hear that shit?\" And I said that I thought she ended it a little prematurely, like didn't even ask if they'd changed anything there, just ended the call. \n\nI said it felt like she was trying to delay getting a new job, was she getting cold feet or something? \n\nShe said no, this is literally how people at her level interview, she was serious about the interview process and she wasn't interested in walking into a shitshow.\n\nI said that was BS, she was sabotaging herself on purpose basically haranguing the companies who want to hire her on the phone. And she was like \"why do they keep coming back for more then? Like I'm critical but I'm not wrong and they know it.\" \n\nWe had this big fight where she insisted that anyone wo was at her level of a career \"interviewed\" by interviewing companies to see whether they were worth their time, just as much as the other way around, and I said that was BS. She got mad I was telling her about her own career and said she knew it better \n\nAITA for arguing with my girlfriend about her interviews? I feel like she's dragging her feet, she says she's interviewing normally for her field.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They need workers just like you need employment. So it is not only reasonable but necessary to be super clear, direct, and confident with regards to what you want.
