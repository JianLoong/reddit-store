Your SIL is totally an AH raising a creepy child.", "NTA, he needed to be told no and needs some type of consequence for his actions. Will the SIL still be brushing things off when he gets older and things escalate?", "NTA.  I would\u2019ve scolded the little sh%t AGAIN with him purposefully letting my dog escape.", "NTA - tell your wife if she wants them over she can only do it when you are not home and if they break anything she has to pay for it herself, not out of household money", "NTA I worked with kids, and something that I learned was that if you don't discipline your kids someone else will, a teacher, a classmate, a neighbor, your sister should be really grateful that the one who did it was someone who actually had their best interests in mind and not someone who just wanted to put them in their place.\n\n\nAnd tell your wife that she can call them and invite them but she's on babysitting and cleaning duty, you aren't hosting or cleaning and your stuff stays locked, see if she still wants to play nice with the children of the corn", "Forget the kid. You got a wife problem.", "NTA and stand your ground!", "NTA. Some one needs to teach him how to behave since his mother clearly won\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t invite them over ever again.", "NTA. And tell your wife they came over, but if a single thing is broken, they\u2019re banned. You can be certain he\u2019ll break something, so that\u2019s your out!", "'Idiots'?\n\nTruly I think you are too kind.\n\nBut I agree with NTA.", "I did it directly in front of the mother because she looked at the broken vase and then continued to talk to my wife, saying goodbye as it nothing happened.\n\nEdit - the look at me thing was because his usual thing is to just wander off when you try to tell him he's doing something wrong and ignore you. Which he started doing after he broke the vase.", "In this case it was justified", "Ha. It was a vase this time, a piece of furniture last time.. like an antique table with delicate wooden trim that he was pulling on until it snapped off. A plant in a pot outside another time, and several glasses that he was drinking from. He doesn't throw things on purpose, maybe(?), but he does manage to break a hell of a lot.\n\nShe has said she doesn't care. But that wasn't the point I was trying to make to him.", "Thai behavior will only escalate it\u2019ll go from him breaking things to get back at u to verbal and maybe even physical violence as he grows someone has to actually parent this kid on he\u2019s going no where good", "NTA but stop inviting her and her kids to your mom's house if they can't follow the rules and when she asks your wife why they aren't allowed it's because they lack manners and their behavior is lacking to include you aren't their babysitters so she can ignore them all the time. As for inviting them to your house, tell your wife she needs to be prepared to pay for all the damages her sisters' kids cause because you aren't and this is where you aren't helping", "Soft YTA. No one knows what is going on with anyone else\u2019s children. Could he have ADHD or some other condition?\n\nYou have every right not to want the child around, but not to use strong discipline against someone else\u2019s child when they are there. Much better to ask SIL to step in if you think her response is insufficient.", "NTA. Get a deposit of $500 in cash up front before they come over. Anything broken or damaged gets taken from the deposit. If nothing, they get the money back. Simple.", "If she doesn't want other people telling her kids off, maybe she could do her parenting herself. \n\nWhat do the grandparents do when this brat is destroying their home?  \n\nNTA", "NTA- One of my friends had a stepkid that would flush things down the toliet or sink/drain\u2019s because they were little asshats. They also would shove things inside the couch cushions because they were too lazy to throw it away while at the grandparents house. They will specifically do things to mess with you and your house. Tell mom to keep her feral kids away from you.", "If you invite them over to your moms again or your new place it would be YTI (you\u2019re the idiot)", "My brother didn\u2019t care for the way he spoke to me, wanted to intervene, and I just shook my head. I\u2019m the aunt and he trust me to handle the situation.", "Honestly, I would leave the sister-in-law at home, invite the kids, then discipline the living shit out of them. Then they might go home as decent human beings.", "Huh?", "That makes me think of a quote from The Great Gatsby - \u201cThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.\u201d", "You could also ask SIL to clean up the broken glass so that her children don\u2019t get hurt.", "My thought exactly!", "Ha, I was thinking, it's getting late, I didn't understand.", "Me either....I tried"]}
