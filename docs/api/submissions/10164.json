Might it possibly one who in her own life models ethical thinking and behavior and treats her spouse with respect? \n\nMy mom believed that she was a good mother. She, however, never copped to carrying on a 29-yr-long affair that ended when the guy died. And she did her best, as did the guy, to enlist me as a go between. I knew about the affair for about 20 years of it. It has been a chief torment of my life. I did not believe, nor did any of the friends, therapists, and clergy I discussed it with, that telling my dad was my role. My mother and her liver's choice to tell me was quite crafty.\n\nI believe my dad knew but turned his head. I suspect he guessed he would die first, and loved her enough to want her to have the resources of his family after his death, and she did. NOTHING she did would have made her a good mother despite all the moves she made so she could tell herself she was.", "Well said, thanks for the new perspective.", "Gl OP, I get you\u2019re between a rock and a hard place, but do you really want this hanging over your morality forever?
