It's a little sad that she was in your wedding and now it seems like you are hardly friends.  It happens.  You can send a nice gift with regrets if you want to maintain the friendship.", "ESH. I think there\u2019s there\u2019s a lot more going on between you two than you\u2019re sharing. The fact that you were her MOH and now you\u2019re at a place where she didn\u2019t even tell you that she was engaged is proof that this friendship is dead. I have a feeling it has something to do with how she felt about her MOH duties and your unsolicited \u201cwarnings\u201d about her relationship.

Don't be petty.", "NTA sounds like this friendship has ran its course.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s not your friend anymore, much less your best friend.\n\nShe never even told you she was getting married.\n\nSo, no, don\u2019t go. It\u2019ll be expensive and not fun.", "YTA\n\nSounds like a more went down at your wedding than you're telling us, and you're glossing over the facts. Sounds like you're no longer really friends.\n\nYou also sound like you dislike her quite a lot - make drama, is immature, boy crazy, etc.\n\nJust leave her alone. She didn't invite you. Take the hint.", "NTA  \nFriend moved quickly? I forsee her crashing and burning, possibly being scammed.   \n\n\nShe didnt tell you, or invite you to the wedding. Do not attend, and seriously rethink said Friendship.", "NTA", "NTA. It sounds like she didn't even invite you to the wedding? So this problem has solved itself.", "ESH. You both need to communicate better/stop being friends. INFO: what happened at the bachelor party? How do you go from being a *fan* of her to [after the party incident] she\u2019s *now* dramatic, immature, selfish, boy crazy, and you openly judged *her* relationship. You don\u2019t need to go the engagement party cause you weren\u2019t directly invited.", "No LOL I didnt turn into bridezilla \ud83d\ude02 actually some bridesmaids said I should have taken more control. \nAnd yeah that sounds fair with making a comment about their relationship maybe I shoulda been more tactful and asked more questions about how she feels or just have not said anything at all. (More so should have not said anything at all)", "NTA! I hate to say this, but this person wasn't a true friend to begin with. You have no obligation to attend her wedding or any other event. She didn't even invite you to the engagement party, her MOTHER did! However, I have a feeling we're only getting a small part of this story. Perhaps she was reacting at your wedding, because maybe she was jealous and feeling left out. You said there was drama, but you didn't say what happened. Did you turn into a bridezilla? Perhaps after you got married, you focused more on your marriage and less on your friendship and for this, she feels slighted.\n\nBTW, telling her that she's moving too fast or making any sort of comment on her relationship, was really none of your business. If this guy is wrong for her, she will see it soon enough, or he'll make the decision for her.", "Good idea thank you", "I read that to mean that her new friends just blindly support her, rather than trying to act like the voice of caution.", "I don\u2019t disprove I\u2019m just a lil scared for her. And I did wonder that too and that\u2019s kinda one of the many reasons why I made this post.", "She said she isn't in the wedding.  She didn't say she wasn't invited.", "My stop being a \u201cfan\u201d was way before the bachelorette party. And she always was immature but i still loved her as a friend and she has been traumatic things and have been coddled by her mom at times that I think didn\u2019t help the maturity. Her mom did invite me she was organizing the thing. And yes I dint tell her my concerns of a fast moving long distance relationship only because I would want a friend to do the same with me if she noticed anything I should be aware of. Do you think I shouldn\u2019t have shared this with her? \nI\u2019m not even going to get into the details of the bachelorette party. Drama happens with almost every wedding. She made a good amount about her but she did stick up for me when the other bridesmaids were being catty and I did appreciate that.\nAny more info u need?", "Ah ok yeah that makes sense.", "Exactly. And these ppl don\u2019t have many other friends so all to most of that attention is just basically to her", "I understand wanting to help her but A.) she\u2019s \u201calways been selfish\u201d and you stayed friends with her, now you\u2019re calling her all of these names instead of addressing the issue/s 1-1. B.) You are adults. No one should be commenting on relationships, imagine if she commented on *your* relationship, would that have changed your mind or just offended you?", "You clearly don\u2019t think much of this person. If this is how you talk about her with strangers on Reddit, I can only imagine how you act towards her. Why do you even care about not being in her wedding?"]}
