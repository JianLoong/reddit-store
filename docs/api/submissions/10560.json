In my schedule, 1.5 hours were put aside for this. The lady was very sweet but when I asked for her to put both her hands up so that i could clean them, evenly cut them, etc, she said no. I didn\u2019t really pay attention to this and started to do the manicure on one hand. When i finished, i asked for the other hand and she said: no, I don\u2019t need the other one done, how much should I pay? \n\nI was surprised and asked, why not? She replied that she doesn\u2019t have the other hand, from an amputation. She was in shock that i didn\u2019t know, stating that she often went to this salon and everyone knew, she asked why i was asking. \n\nI then thought about the pricing and told her the price was 2/3 of the full price. She started arguing with me, saying that she should only be paying half price as it was only one hand. I apologised but said that i hadn\u2019t been told previously about the situation, so had blocked out the time already, so she would be paying for the time too. She complained about it and complained about me to reception. I was very sorry but i hadn\u2019t been told about it earlier, had i been notified, the situation would be different", "created_utc": 1677002248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118bl6r/aita_for_charging_a_disabled_woman_full_price/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since she\u2019s a repeat customer, there should be a payment history", "NTA. Your time is money.  If you had known about the need for accommodation, it might have been different. The customer assumed you knew what others in the salon knew, and that's her problem.  \n\nWhen I get my hair cut, I always remind the person cutting my hair about the bone-anchored hearing aid implant in my skull, even if that stylist has cut my hair before.  They have other customers to deal with, and I don't assume they remember my issue.", "NAH.  Your client could have explained when she scheduled that she didn\u2019t need the full 90 minutes.  But she\u2019s not an AH because she didn\u2019t.\n\nYou lost work because the receptionist didn\u2019t know to block out less time.  That\u2019s not your fault.  \n\nIt\u2019s a miscommunication", "NTA, your time counts for something, 2/3rds price seems like a more than fair discount.", "NTA. honestly, 2/3rds price sounds fairly reasonable for only one hand, even if you had scheduled a more appropriate amount of time. there's still costs beyond the time spent actually performing the service. \n\nlike, isn't the setup and cleanup roughly the same amount of effort regardless of one hand or two? you'll still have to clean the same station area and equipment, no? \n\ni was a massage therapist for a long time, and clients would sometimes ask me why my half-hour ask wasn't exactly half of my one-hour rate. changing/washing sheets, sanitizing the table, washing my hands, and paperwork takes exactly the same amount of time regardless of how long the session took. \n\nif the other people in the salon want to charge her half-off, that's on them, but you're not TA for charging 2/3rds.", "YTA. \n\nRegardless of whether you knew ahead of time, you should've only charged half. Not only did she only have 1 hand, you unintentionally embarrassed her and made matters worse by not adjusting the price accordingly to fix the situation you created. A simple apology and price adjustment to reflect that you only did half the work would've saved the customer from any further embarrassment. Instead, the situation was made worse. A manicure does not cost that much that you HAD to charge 2/3 instead of 1/2.", "Do customers typically make appointments with you? As it stands, the post makes it seem like customers *don't* typically make appointments with you directly, because you say the receptionist booked this person. \n\nYou're charging the customer because someone didn't communicate to you, but why is that the customer's fault? The customer wouldn't be the one communicating to you anyway, but you're still expecting the customer to be the one to make it right to you! That doesn't seem fair. YTA", "YTA. If we're her I would never come back to you. It's \nnot  her fault for the misunderstanding why should she pay for it? In your shoes I would have sucked it up and just charged the customer half.", "YTA.\n\nI get that you didn't know but its not her fault the assumption was made either. And she told you before you started that it was only 1 hand.\n\nYou should have taken this one on the chin", "Try harder. Were you doing her nails through some kind of manicure glory hole? You asked multiple times that she present a hand that she doesn't have? What?", "YTA, she only got one hand done, half the work, she pays half the price.  You estimated the time, she didn\u2019t ask for it. That\u2019s not on her to make up.", "NTA - As you said, you set aside time for the full service. If she wanted to bargain, she should have done so earlier, not surprise you in hopes she gets her way. She could be sensitive to the loss and not want to discuss it, but that's not on you.", "INFO: did the receptionist know/were there notes in her profile?", "NTA. You had no way to know, and she was deliberately evasive with you. For that reason you were unable to set a price up front, leading to the subsequent conflict.\n\nI suppose an argument could be made that it would be *nice* to give her the full discount, but that should have been cleared up front with reception before your time was allocated. You're not an asshole for offering a compromise between full and half price.", "YTA\n\nIt isn't that lady's fault that you were booked for full time...it was the receptionist's fault and miscommunication on your side not the lady and the customer had to pay for it which isn't fair at all\n\nYes your time is valuable but the lady didn't book you for 1.5 hr your salon did not her", "NTA.\n\nOffering 2/3 price was a very generous offer on your part.\n\nHalf the nails does not mean half the time/effort. I'm sure she has plenty of struggles that deserve lots of sympathy, but this is just entitlement.", "YTA! That poor woman. You overcharged and humiliated her but also whoever made the appointment should have made you aware. You owe her an apology and a free manicure if your salon doesn\u2019t want to lose her business, although I suspect it\u2019s already too late", "NTA.\n\nIt's not just the cost of materials, its the time you took to providing a service.\n\nYou still provided a discount and were still well within your rights to charge full price.", "YTA and probably caused more problems.", "YTA and lack basic human compassion. Greedy greedy piece of work", "YTA idk like u did one hand, she has one hand, why charge her full price??", "WOW. Tie one of your hands to your side tomorrow and see how long it takes you to feel like the AH you are.", "NTA and 2/3 is very fair you still need to clean the tools you still need to clean the space single-use items like nail files etc are still used. The only difference between her and someone with 2 hands is the 1/3rd the time it takes to do a second hand.", "NTA.\n\nbut why were so insistent on painting her other hand?", "Nta but she deserves  a refund from the salon itself", "Unpopular judgment\u2026 ESH ! \nBoth of you are too stubborn! \nIt is not something you will face a lot, and you could have accepted a minor loss! It is not like that all amputees will come running to your salon in the future to take advantage of you. And you lost the chance to make her a regular customer.\n(You could yell at the recipient later to feel better (/s)\n\nAnd the lady failed to understand your point of view and meet you halfway like you suggested!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you accepted half-price, everybody would want half price. Isn\u2019t fair to the other customers or your business. You\u2019re very kind for giving her 2/3 tho.", "But it\u2019s one patient. She can learn from this for next time and accept the loss", "Would the client have known that block of time was reserved for her? When I get my nails done they\u2019re just done when they are. I don\u2019t ever know the time it\u2019s going to take", "When I book an appointment I don\u2019t decide the time they block for me, nor do I know the time that\u2019s been blocked\u2026 that\u2019s on them.", "Exactly. The same amount of space prep and cleanup happened. The tools still need to be autoclaved.", "I agree this one is simply not worth the drama or argument. Fix the situation going forward, but charging for 2/3 when you only did 1/2 because the lady is missing a hand is never going to look nice. And how much money are you really missing out on?", "For real..... As a manicurist how did you get this far into the interaction and not notice that she was missing a hand???\n\nThat is next level obliviousness.", "Thank you, I'm blind as all get out, and even I can tell if people are only 1 armed", "And make it easy on yourself\u2014make it your non-dominant hand. You are beyond belief.", "What is supposed to learn? To ask every potential client if they have two hands?\n\nThe lady should have specified when she booked that she only needed half a slot.", "The price for doing nails typically doesn't change (unless you get a different style that takes more time), it's a flat rate. So when you book an appointment that costs $90, it doesn't matter if it takes 2 hours or 20 minutes, you're paying $90", "Then that's on you for not respecting the time of your service workers.", "There are always people walking in salons so I\u2019m sure that time didn\u2019t go to waste, find another client. Besides that,  they clearly were not paying attention to  the client of they didn\u2019t notice a whole hand/part of an arm missing. But regardless, I\u2019m not going to be lectured about wasting someone\u2019s time when I didn\u2019t choose the duration of the appointment", "There has been a few times where I've suggested to the receptionist at my GP that she might want to book a longer slot. Few times I had 3-4 issues to talk about rather than one quick thing, and other times I've had things like ingrown toenails removed where I had to book 3 slots in a row.\n\nIn both those situations I wasn't the one deciding anything, I mentioned it to the receptionist and she either decided herself or checked with one of the GPS. But she wouldn't have been able to do that if I hadn't been communicative at the start", "It\u2019s not about respect or disrespect. Nobody asks the manicurist what time the appointment ends. It ends when my nails are done. How long that takes depends on them."]}
