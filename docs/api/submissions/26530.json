I can't imagine the emotional pain you went through all your life. Just preserve your relationship with the brother you love, and let the rest go.

The best way to stick it to these people who are biologically related to you but aren't your family, is to become successful; then you'll never need them for anything.", "NTA\n\nBut it may hurt your chances of taking him out in the future, until he is no longer a minor and no longer living at home.", "yes, once when i was 17 but my father Said i Faked it and i dont really know why He doesent Like me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "i was in therapie from 14 - 16 and but on every session she broke down crying so i stopped going, but i am planning to go to a therapist again", "NTA.  I am curious though, did the DNA test say he was your father?  From your post and responses; it sounds like your mom had an affair and they thought he was not your father.  If the test said he is your father, that would mean they'd have to admit that they were wrong.  And that they treated you badly your entire life because they were too stupid to get a test.  Regardless, you are not responsible for any of it.", "Your therapist broke down crying? I\u2019m confused.

NOPE you are not in the wrong here.  You're caving to family guilt. They're telling your things that are not true and you're sort of buying into it.\n\nBlock everyone except your good brother.

Your abusers are using those tactics to force you to violate your own healthy boundaries through emotional manipulation- the long distance tools of abusers.\n\nBeware of ANYONE in your circle who uses those kinds of hurtful aggressive attacks to get you to do something you do not want to do.

If so, and not a real desire of yours to spend your time, energy and resources on that thing, yet are also reluctant for some reasons, That nagging feeling is likely due to fear, obligation and/or guilt that is being used against you. \n\nOnce you recognize the emotional manipulation/abuse that's the source of your bad feeling, you can shift to being angry at people who hurt you on purpose and respond with stronger, firmer boundaries when dealing with them.", "Sometimes rude demands need rude answers.\n\nMy family was generally kinder, so I have no basis for comparison.

What likely happens is the toxic one tells the flying monkeys they are welcome to ring and gives out the number.", "Shit I only have the numbers for my mom and brother.  Sister, uncles, aunts, cousins, last surviving grandma, don't have their numbers and honestly don't want it.  However when my dad died and I didn't attend his services because he was an abusive asshole, suddenly, everyone had my number.  \n\nIt was kinda amusing to experience how people who degraded me and ignored me for the vast majority of my life suddenly had a whole lot to say to me.\n\nToo bad they're all trash.
