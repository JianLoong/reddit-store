Because I'd personally be pissed if all of my hard earned money is given away..", "So your mother has her OWN car, but drives the family one when you put gas in it?\n\nALSO, your brother is old enough to drive yet still receives an allowance???????\n\nPretty sure I know who the entitled people are, and it's not you OP.\n\nNTA.\n\nIf they don't stick to the rules, then why should you!", "NTA.  You made your point; but things are not going to change.  \n\nYour mother pays sporadically. But at least she does and she also pays for her own car. Your brother seems to be the person who is not paying his fair share; and your mother doesn't want to deal with the hassle of reminding him to pay. Maybe there is a way of denying him access to the car, such as changing the locks and making him pay for gas every time that he takes the keys (yes, expensive).  The only viable alternatives that I can think of are to (a) move into your own place (even if it's with a roommate) and/or (b) buy your own car for your exclusive use.  If you continue to subtract gas money from what you give your mother every month, I suspect that you'll be exercising option (a) sooner than you think.", "NTA \n\nIs that your monthly pay or biweekly? I\u2019ll\nAssume monthly. It sounds like your mom expects you to keep it fuelled for the luxury of using the car \n\nYou have several options\n\n1. Move out with a couple of roommates. With your combined finances you should be able to find a place \n\n2. Stay home, do not use the car for at least a couple of weeks (could try renting a car if you absolutely need a vehicle) then sit back and watch what happens \n\n3. Keep doing what you are doing and spend more of your money on fuel\n\nEta obviously the fuel up rule applies to only you", "Oh they\u2019re inconsiderate because you\u2019re giving a lot of money towards your mother. And NTA! But if things continue you might want to look for a place yo yourself.", "NTA\n\nLook you don't want to refuel a bunch of times, but it may be the best alternative that you bring the car home Friday with minimal gas and save that extra $50.  The solution will quickly hit those who want to use your gas but not chip in.  Doesn't seem like your mother will budge otherwise and you are not deducting.  Not the best solution but a competent passive aggressive solution.", "NTA, but I don't think this is one you can win.  I would be saving to move out.", "NTA, but as someone else said, you won't win this.  It's time to move out.", "Move out. Your brother can pay her bills.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, can you just move out?  If you have a roommate, you will pay less than you are paying to stay with your parents, and you can get your own car.  I'm not sure what country you are in, but here a used car can be fairly inexpensive.  I live in a rural area and commute and still my gas is $150 a month, car payment is $200 and insurance $100 a month.  Rent at an apartment here is $1000, with all bills paid, split with a roommate is $500, groceries for one person about $200.  That's $1150 monthly about, and you own your car. Of course, that's here, but you may want to consider such a move.", "NTA. Stop filling the tank up so much and leave the car with about enough to get it to the gas station.on Friday.", "NTA sounds like you're getting a raw deal.\n\nNext time your brother uses it and leaves it empty, leave it like that or make sure you're leaving it like that and make her use her own provided gas money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're not getting your money's worth at your mom's.", "You're not being an asshole for wanting expenses to be shared fairly. However, you did start subtracting the money from the \"rent\" you paid without warning. That needs to change. It's time to insist on a sit-down to talk out what would be a fairer way to share the car expenses including gas.\n\nThe only other alternatives I can think of are to get your own vehicle (car, moped, scooter, etcetera) or to just put in enough gas to cover your use each time. That means you'd have to take the extra time to add that gas only when you need to.\n\nPlease consider finding your own place to live if you can. That way you can have complete control over where your money goes.", "NTA but stop putting so much fuel in the car. Put a bit mor than you know you will use and when you need to go somewhere else fill a bit more in.\n\nIs it bothersome? Sure but see when you do this how fast they will stop using the car you are using.\n\nIf they protest Tell them you returned the car with the same amount of fuel you took it with.", "NTA - it might be an idea to look for rooms to rent.

Then whoever used it during the weekend would have to provide their own gas.\n\nNTA. Mom can use her own car. Brother can provide his own gas.

I think it is time to find a roommate and get away from your mom.", "I would only fill up the car to roughly the amount I will use it. If you know you're only driving for a total of 40 kilometers round trip, only put that much gas in. If they complain, then let them complain. It's not right they are using your gas money on your dime.", "Wondering how much moving out and living on her own would cost. Might be worth considering, OP.\n\nAlso, NTA.

He is 18 years old.", "We have no idea where OP lives, and that i think would make a big difference. $800 could be a rip-off or a fantastic deal on rent, location-depending", "There is also the option of doing the same thing as them :put less fuel in and leave it almost on empty until op needs it. It will also reduce the use of the car once they'll need to fuel before using it.", "Exactly! Looks like she is trying to profit from your gas money as well", "Hmm, what is the 800 euros used for? (If it is not too personal)", "Food  and bills (cost  of  living  is  high in  my  country)", "And you mother works as well? Perhaps you could think of moving out? And also it is weird that your mother uses the family car instead of her own car? You are def nta", "$800 for rent and food in a high cost of living area does not seem that high.  Depending on the kind of food, but $50 a week for groceries for OP so $200 a month does not seem out of the ordinary, then maybe $50 to $100 for utilities, that leaves about $500-550 for \"rent.\" That does not sound unreasonable for a room in a house/apartment. \n\n>also it is weird that your mother uses the family car instead of her own car?\n\nI think the \"family\" is moms car, there could be various reasons to use the family car. Size for parking/cargo capacity/gas mileage etc...."]}
