You just need to fill out the forms.", "As I said, elderly should be able to use it and I do think OP is TA. That's not what I commented on.", "I feel you. As a Young person with a chronic pain conditions (spine, nerve issue mainly) , I get weird looks all the time. I\u2019ve been accused of using my walking aid as a fashion item. People just like to make everything their business. \nGlad you\u2019re feeling better :)", "Exactly!", "You mean a disability that would justify a handicap sticker? That is covered.", "Of course not, disabled people usually have handicapped placards and use handicap spots...\ud83d\ude44", "If it\u2019s that severe odds are they have a handicap sticker. Otherwise, they should. \u201cPeople who are struggling\u201d is way to open ended. For example: I started working out today. Tomorrow and the following day I will \u201cstruggle\u201d. So I can now use these spaces?", "I am. Not that it matters, but my ankle was shattered when I was in the army. I'm in my 50s now, and it's been scoped several times, and I can't walk long distances. I COULD qualify for a handicapped placard if I wanted to, and I'm still not going to park in that spot.", "We\u2019re talking about the space on the subway and who they should be for, you tried to say it should end at pregnant and elderly, I pointed out that\u2019s excluding people with disabilities. If you\u2019re saying that\u2019s already covered, then so are the pregnant and the elderly.", "Idk where you\u2018re from but getting handicapped stickers often isn\u2019t very easy and can be a long process. I personally am not even 30, have a chronic pain condition in my whole left leg and lower spine, need a walking aid but I don\u2019t qualify for it yet. I\u2018ll go ahead and park on expected mother parkings though.\nWhat are they gonna do? Make me take a pregnancy test in front of them?", "Oh so you are one of those weirdos who makes their lives harder than they need to be so you can complain about how hard your life is", "The military teaches you to follow rules and tell on others who don\u2019t follow them, or at least put pressure on rule-breakers. I\u2019ve been there and I get that it\u2019s ingrained into you. \n\nBut you\u2019re not in the military anymore. \n\nThe real world has gray areas and rules that are stupid, plus \u201crules\u201d that aren\u2019t really rules. You get to exercise your critical thinking skills a lot more. In this case, my critical thinking skills tell me that YTA for trying to shame a person who isn\u2019t hurting anyone. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s in pain or just having a bad day or whatever. It\u2019s not a handicap spot, you don\u2019t have to have a positive pregnancy test as proof of parking eligibility, so she can choose to park there. It\u2019s not your job to try to make her feel like a bad person for parking in a spot you don\u2019t think she should be in.", "\"My life sucks so everyone should be as miserable as me!\"\n\nShaming a 70 year old for parking close to the store while acting morally superior because you were in the army is just wrong. You're like the hapless wannabe-villain that gets viciously mocked in a Looney Tunes short.", "I see. So you\u2019re one of those people with the mindset of \u201cI suffer so everyone else should suffer too!!!\u201d. It\u2019s an extremely immature viewpoint to have as a fully grown 50 yr old.", "You suffer from a bad case of main character syndrome.", "Wow. What a hero.", "No. We are talking about handicap and pregnancy parking. The statement said \u201cit should be like the subway\u201d. It\u2019s ok. You are all idiots.", "That\u2019s a choice you can make. The result could end with you getting towed. Again, you people are to damn sense to understand that the rules must be explicitly clear, or they will be taken advantage of.", "I was going to be one of those weirdos when I got my foot amputated in July.  Then my doc showed up at my rehab hospital while I was doing inpatient PT/OT dropped the placard on my table and said here ya stubborn asshole"]}
