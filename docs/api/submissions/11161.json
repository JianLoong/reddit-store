She\u2019s a toxic mess who needs to be blocked and ignored.", "NTA, not in the slightest. \n\nA memorial is about remembering the person who passed and to offer support to the family and friends who may still be struggling in their grief, it's not a social event to snap pics and post on IG. \n\nMight I gently recommend for next year you either do not invite her or speak with church leaders in order to discuss her behaviour with her further.", "NTA.\n\nI never understood people taking pictures at funerals. People are not at their best, if they are anything like me, they have red eyes (and I'm an ugly crier).  Honestly, who really needs or wants photographs of one of the worst days of their lives?\n\nYou set a reasonable boundary and she overstepped.", "NTA.  But perhaps the better move would have been to fight fire with fire.  Take a picture of her taking a picture and post that to social media, with \"Here's Church Lady, predictably organizing a group photo at my son's memorial despite the fact that I expressly asked her not to do this.\"", "NTA If she's a member of this church and is regularly making other members uncomfortable after being asked to stop, she needs to be kicked out until she can act right. Can you talk to your priest/pastor/etc.? Maybe as a group so they take you more seriously? Also, I'm very sorry for your loss. I can't imagine how hard this is for you.", "Nta. You told her it was a boundary and she disrespected it. AT YOUR CHILDS MEMORIAL. You literally just wanted a day to grieve in peace with your church family and God. She had no place to disrupt that.", "NTA if you decide it\u2019s inappropriate then it doesn\u2019t matter what she thinks. This is about you and your son\u2019s memory not her.", "NTA. I don't think taking photos at a memorial is appropriate. Does the church pastor (or whatever the leader there is called) speak to her about this?", "NTA. You specifically asked her not to take photos and she blatantly ignored your wishes at your own son\u2019s memorial. Not sure exactly what you said when you saw her taking the pictures, but I definitely don\u2019t blame you for saying something.", "NTA.\n\nNot only is this incredibly rude of your \"friend\" it is also invasive!", "NTA\nSorry to hear of your son's passing.  My condolences.\nYou have a reasonable expectation, and have established boundaries.  This photographer is leveraging your pain and grieving for their own self promotion and is clearly the Ahole here.", "NTA.  Short of you telling her you hope she burns in hell (not church appropriate :))... I think a level of rudeness by you is fine.\n\nTaking and posting pictures of people without their permission is the height of rudeness.  I realize lots of people want to put their whole life on social media, but there is no reason to put everyone else's life.  It's a morbid, vulture-like existence  - creating this illusion of a perfect life and friendships by leeching onto others.\n\nIf you told me she was the media director or publicist for the church, I might cut her some slack, but even then she should respect your wishes.  This is not the media.  You're not a public figure.\n\nI coach a lot of youth sports and people CONSTANTLY post pictures of me and kids on social media without permission.  It's obnoxious.  As a coach, I'm (very slightly) a public figure.  Posting other people's family?  Tasteless.\n\nI would recommend speaking with church officials.  If church isn't a safe place for privacy... what is?", "NTA.\n\nPeople should ask before taking pictures of other people, and they need to respect when the answer is no.", "NTA, obviously, but I was wondering if you could speak to your pastor/vicar/priest and get them to have a quiet word?  \n\nThis is such inappropriate behaviour from her, especially after you asked her not to.  And at such an inappropriate time, too!  \n\nYou needed time to heal, reflect and remember, yet you had to deal with this.  I'm so sorry.\n\nNTA.", "I am so very sorry for your loss. Clearly NTA, but she certainly is. That was SO inappropriate of her. She was given the message clearly in advance to not take photos and she did anyway. I would have asked her to leave immediately.", "NTA  you deserve privacy and she needs to respect it", "NTA, you told her BEFOREHAND and she did it anyway at an incredibly sensitive time.", "NTA\n\nThis woman is absolutely an AH.  It's one thing if someone **wants** their picture taken or gives explicit permission.  But it seems she absolutely refuses to respect anyone's boundaries.  \n\nIf you didn't want pictures taken at your son's memorial, you have every right to refuse.  Since she has a habit of ignoring boundaries, a blunt or rude statement is justified.  Sometimes people need a verbal clue by four to make very clear how much they've transgressed.", "NTA. Camera lady is clearly also a boundaries stomper.", "NTA\n\nNo offense, but do you really want pictures of your sons' memorial service? I don't believe I've ever seen pictures of a funeral in a family album. It's not typically what you want to remember. It's a service to say goodbye and celebrate who they were.\n\nSomething similar happened on my wifes side of the family. An uncle of hers passed young (50ish) from a brain tumor that he had been fighting for a little over a year. It was a long, hard year for that family to see him go. The thing is, that uncle was one of 6 kids. Every year, the 6 kids took a photo together with their mom, as a ritual thing. At the after-party, the kids elected to get together for their usual picture, now minus the uncle. The widow of that uncle was furious, because they were only all together because her husband had died. They had no clue why she was mad.\n\nI get it.", "NTA. I would have kicked her out of the service. What a self-centred, tone-deaf and disrespectful person.", "NTA. Does she have a mental illness? Because snapping away after you\u2019ve specifically asked her to cease and desist is odd\u2026", "NTA She has problems with boundaries and you're right to defend yours.", "NTA, you set boundaries and she didn't respect them. Also memorial services are not a place to take pictures. Pictures are to remember a place in time/event. Memorial services are to remember someone, but you wouldn't take a picture to remember an event that's held to remember a person (that's what pictures of the person is for).", "Nta. That\u2019s incredibly rude and annoying.", "NTA - Sorry about your son \nThis friend does not respect you and your son , you did the right thing", ">I might not have acted too nice when I saw her getting ready to take pictures.\n\n~~INFO:~~ Well, what did you actually do or say?\n\nNTA based on OP's response below.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Outside of physical assault (which let's be honest is a near zero percent chance of being the case), any reaction she had was warranted and tbh, long overdue. She has tried being nice. She has tried asking them. She's tried telling them. A more serious reaction was warranted.", "Funeral, Celebration of Life, Memorial - I guess the biggest difference is whether the body is there. \n\nEither way, I still think it's not the time for photos, ESPECIALLY if the person most impacted by the death (and, as the parent of the deceased, I say it's her and her immediate family) requested that no photos be taken.", "Agree to disagree.

OP just lost their child. 17 years old and they never get to grow up or figure out who they are.  \n\nThis woman - against OP's express wishes, which OP made sure to express prior to the event - took photos at a memorial service like it was the prom.  It was grossly inappropriate under any circumstance, yet even *worse* in this instance.  \n\nOP was grieving and confronted with a woman who only thinks of herself and the amusement she can get from taking pictures against other people's express wishes.  It's irrelevant what OP said.  Whatever it was, it was well deserved.  And, frankly, even if it weren't, OP would get a pass bc a parent faced with rudeness at the memorial of their 17yo son can't be held responsible for intemperate things they might say in response.\n\nOP - NTA. I'm sorry for your loss.  When you feel up to it, please speak to the pastor/priest about this woman's intrusiveness.", "Who cares?
