{"id": 20899, "submission_id": "14m8zat", "title": "AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to repay her school loans to her parents?", "selftext": "**UPDATE\n\nI'm done getting lynched.**\n\nMost of those who commented **did not read my post**, did not get my point, downvoted my explainations and know FUCK ALL about me, my girfriend and our realtionship. Obviously the downvoting of my clarifications reflects the need to light up my strawman, I don't see any reason. I think I have been polite and discoursive, and I have only gottens insults back. Probably shouldn't have asked teenagers how to handle adult life. I initially kept it out of the scope of this post, but I did help her these last times, financially. I do not hold it against her and I do not want her to pay me back. I want her to have a successfull life, even if eventually we might not end up forever togheder. I don't want her to cut ties with her family, and I would hate for it to happen. That's why I suggested talking and explaining. I have been accusing of wanting to CONTROL her money. Apart from the ridiculousness of the fact that I am barely trying to control MY money, I have been getting groceries for her out of my 500 euros salary.\nI will leave this here, which I believe summarizes the situation well:\n\n> NAH - If she needs to pay 50K euros on a salary of 20K, she will not be in a position to contribute to a house or to have the time/money for children. Even if she's paying it out of her salary, that means her next 5-10 years are going to be affected by this debt. By extension, anyone who partners with her will be affected. I can't fault her for living up to the agreement with her parents. She also has been making a point of splitting costs 50/50. She acted entirely ethically. The problem is, if you're in a relationship, her debt is going to affect the life you can have together.\n\n\nI won't blame my girlfriend: I adivsed her against it but ultimately she made a choice as a 20yo something inexperienced girl, but **her parents should have known better.** Ultimately, I don't want to be the one paying 90% of the rent, utilities and food because we need to repay a useless debt. I wish to establish a thorough and well tought plan to make a family of us. Morally, its wrong to fleece her parents but its wronger to cripple us two for a decade. That makes me TA, but it makes a A that has a point. A valid one. \n\nAlso, the US are a fucked up place and honestly you should ponder how my situation, the worst kind of loan situation where I live is regarded as \"nothing bad, its just debt\" where you live. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSo my GF and I are planning to move togheder after three years of relationship, and money came up as a point of discussion. We are both fine with splitting up expenses in a 50/50 manner. We live in the EU. She is in university, I am soon to be working as a decently (but not grealty) paid government employee.\n\nThe problem is that my GF, years ago, chose to move to a big city and study at a private university instead of a public one. Her parents, likely being overconfident in their economical possibilities, decided to pay for my GF's studies but at the condition of being paid back as soon as she gets working, seeing that she could have chosen a public (and cheap) uni instead. She has to repay about 50K euros, in a country with a median net salary of 20K.\n\nMy GF's degree is not really \"marketable\" and such a debt would cripple her (ours) start in life hurting us much more than it would hurt their parents not to get the money back. As an addition, my opinion is that parents should facilitate their kids life, and they should not expect children to be economically neutral or positive to them.\n\nMy GF assured me that she would pay her parents back from her own salary. But really, that would be money coming out of our already thin paychecks and I would end up needing to compensate for her initially low, and then even lower salary after the loan payments. I told her that I do not care for her parents and I feel morally fine cutting ties with them. I told her that we, as a couple, need to make us two a priority and that I do not want to be collateral damage of her and her family irresponsible decisions. I am not suggesting to flip off her parents, but politely explain to them that we have a serious need of money and they don't. \n\nShe proceeded to get mad, reassuring me that we would not feel any monetary damage (which is literally untrue) and that eventually we will be fine.", "created_utc": 1688054919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m8zat/aita_for_not_wanting_my_girlfriend_to_repay_her/", "score": 2510, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She knew what the deal was, and she accepted it. You don't just screw someone out of 50k because they have a house, car etc...As you mentioned in the comments, in your country it takes about 10years to save that much, are 10 years of her parents lives not worth as much as 10 years of your life? Do the right thing, pay the money back and yes if you can help her then great you pay it off even faster, but she made this decision, and you have a decision to either live with it or to break up and start your own life debt free, but her parents are not at fault here and should not by any means have to give up 50k because your girlfriend made a bad decision.", "LOL definitely YTA.

You can\u2019t hold others to your own personal standards. \n\nPeople like you and I have to work twice as hard because we have our parents dragging us down on one end and a huge sense of personal responsibility for our own kids (future kids in your case) on the other end.

My husband and literally never get a break because I am constantly occupied at home and he is constantly occupied at work and we barely afford anything. Meanwhile our parents spend money on themselves as though they are royalty ($50 000 per year on clothing, massive parties, in home hired help, etc.)\n\nMy advice to you is the same as everyone on here. Don\u2019t make her cut ties with her parents. They are behaving in a socially acceptable manner and so is she. What you can do is on a personal level, try to surround yourself with people that enjoy contributing to bettering the lives of others. It is exhausting to be around people that don\u2019t have this mentality if you are a builder yourself. \n\nI will add one more thing: drop the negative attitude and get a second job. Start saving for your kids\u2019 education now. Don\u2019t become the parent you think is behaving in a morally reprehensible manner.

She owes her parents the money, she should pay back the money.\n\nHowever, OP keeps asking 'what should I do?', so I'd love to try and help. I'm a 35 yr old from the US, btw... not a teenager. And yes, our views on debt and student loans are fucked. We know!\n\nThis situation is fairly common, though, so you might consider the advice. I graduated from grad school + undergrad with 15k in student loans. I started my first job at roughly 32k per year. My partner (been together 11 years, always kept finances separate), also had about the same in student loans, but is a few years older and was making triple what I was. When we moved in together, we had similar conversations - how do we divide rent, utilities, etc, while also having our own expenses (debt). We ALWAYS split bills 50/50, even with the disparity in income. I just made sure to share with him what I could afford, as the one making less. Some people talk about splitting based on % of income. Personally, I never wanted that, but you just have to do whats best for the two people in the relationship.  \n\nAll that to say/and I think what a lot of people are saying to you is - LIVE WITHIN YOUR MEANS. When you look at housing, utilities, or anything that is SHARED, make sure its in your budget. By 'your', I mean the both of you. This might mean you dont live in as nice of an apt/home as you might down the road, but you're just starting out! She needs to create a budget that includes repaying her parents. She has the luxury of not paying interest, so its just a matter of chipping away at the debt. \n\nWill she always make that salary, or are there opportunities for her career to grow? If it's her first job out of uni, she can only go up from there! (barring any kind of drastic career change)\n\nThis is just life. It sucks. And yes, she + her parents made a financially irresponsible decision at the start of your relationship, but not repaying them at all would likely ruin the relationship with her parents. Is that worth it? Could she speak with them about a payment plan + timeline to repay? Or even bring the amount down SOME, on good faith that it will help the two of you start your lives? Those could be worth exploring. But just saying 'sorry, not repaying it!' is an aggressive choice that isnt going to end well for anyone.", "YTA. Unfortunately the only person to blame here is your girlfriend, she made an incredibly stupid financial decision which I agree her parents shouldn\u2019t have supported.

Hopefully they will let her setup a payment plan so that she can still pay for herself & it doesn\u2019t all fall onto you. Perhaps she can get a second job for a little while? I do sympathise as someone who married a person with debt, the first few years of my relationship I supported my partner financially whilst living together. He\u2019s steadily made more money over the years and we are now comfortably splitting everything 50/50 as his debt is paid off. However, when we do buy a house for example, it will be my savings we use as he has almost nothing. Could I wait 10 years for him to save enough to by a house? Sure. Though I\u2019m not going to stop living my life/pushing back goals because of his poor financial decisions. It\u2019s really not fair, but I love him and that enough for me.

Your girlfriend and the repayment are a package deal since before she met you, so you take it or leave it, no alternatives.

And if that damages the relationship, then don't be together. But by no means are you in a position to suggest cutting ties with her family.

But it doesn\u2019t matter that you don\u2019t want to pay it, she HAS to pay it back. It\u2019s done and decided, she owes that money. You don\u2019t just get to decide that you want to be with her so her income and yours are now conjoined and you don\u2019t have to honor any obligations she has that you disagree with. This is not a matter of debate, she WILL have to pay that money back. The decision to spend it was hers, she knew her options. You are extremely self-centered in that you seem to think your wants are a priority. \n\nYour choices are not pay her parents back or not. She has to pay them back.

Many other women don\u2019t have this debt, date one of them. If you want to be with your girlfriend then much like her having to pay for the private school she wanted you can deal with her making these payments. And the stupid moral/logical fallacy you\u2019ve latched to is irrelevant because this isn\u2019t about you at all. In fact, it has absolutely nothing to do with you. Before you respond with \u201cI\u2019d have to make up the additional monies from my salary\u201d please realize you do not have to if you do not live with her. You wanting to live with her does not supersede her debt. How do you seriously think you figure into this equation at all as you do not even live together currently?

If it was a bank, would you be telling her she shouldn't repay her loans to the bank at all? \n\nYou need to sit down and make a budget together and think about how to allocate it and how both you and her will contribute to shared expenses. If this doesn't work for you then maybe you shouldn't be moving in together.

I\u2019m unclear why her degree would not be marketable and it is lousy that post secondary is so ridiculously expensive but you\u2019re not really working with her towards a viable solution.  I worked 2-3 jobs in my 20\u2019s to get ahead.  Perhaps both of you could consider that to plan the pay down.  She should be more aware of financial impact/cost of living but as you said, it probably wasn\u2019t really taught so now she has a hard lesson.  If you\u2019re saving for a house just get it in your name until you know for sure the longevity of your relationship.  You could rent a room in a shared house until she gets more paid down.  Everyone I know made sacrifices in their 20\u2019s for their own future.\nYTA because you\u2019re so flippant about her cutting off ties with her parents.  Not cool.  Not paying them back, also not ok.  I like that you\u2019re wanting independence because you clearly haven\u2019t thought through any potential inheritance from them.   \nErasing the deal and the past decisions aren\u2019t possible so you need to support her in finding solutions.  She\u2019s probably embarrassed about it.  Reality has arrived and her working more is a reasonable start.

If a court were to order her to repay her debt, it would be the marginal amount, that is left over between her cost of living, a little spending money, and whatever her income is. So likely she wouldn't pay it off in her lifetime on her salary, but that was the creditor's risk.Since OP said, that he had to pay for groceries recently, that means her payment rate to her parents is simply too high at the moment.She needs to renegotiate the rate with her parents and adjust it to her actual cost of living, which doesn't include OP.\n\nOP's current problem with paying for her costs would be fixed.But the other part of the problem is OP's future financial situation. Which is that once he gets married to his GF it would be hard to get out of paying a higher monthly rate to settle the debt based on household income instead of her income alone.So yes, he would be paying for her debt eventually.Now, it's obviously his decision to marry someone in debt. But OP doesn't seem to want to ditch the GF, and seems to care about her, so he recommended an option. Ditching the parents. It's definitely an effective option to eliminate both his current and future financial problems while keeping the GF.But it's also very obviously shortsighted, void of any emotion, made out of inexperience or heat of the moment, an AH-move and something worth apologizing for.\n\nThere need to be two negotiations happening between the GF and her parents, though. One on the current payment rate, which is too high for her cost of living. Until they are married, this shouldn't include OP at all.\n\nThe other is on the future of the debt which then leads to a discussion between OP and his GF on his financial boundaries and their relationship.The parents and the GF need to be open about what they want out of each other. What do they actually want for their children, GF's future, future children, rising cost of living, etc. This is where you ditch the expectations and go with empathy as the superior negotiation technique. Also, it's entirely between GF and her parents.Then OP and GF need to see where they stand in the relationship. Is OP willing to support her debt or not? How much sacrifice can love take?

Look I do understand what you\u2019re saying: if her debt payments to her parents comes out of her salary, then you\u2019re concerned that you may end up having to partially compensate for her share of your living costs as she won\u2019t have the same discretionary income, this affecting you financially. It\u2019s also possible that if she\u2019d taken a different degree or attended a different university that she\u2019d be in a different position.\n\nBut this is an agreement made between her and her parents. It sounds like they essentially gave her a 0% interest loan with no set minimum monthly pay backs. She could discuss with them what sums she could afford, she could confirm with them that she\u2019ll have to pay them slowly over a long period. There are several options, but ultimately it\u2019s something that exists between them prior to your relationship, and your input isn\u2019t relevant even though you intend to be together long term.\n\nThe issue is not the concern for your own financial well being - that is understandable. It is the case that entering into a committed relationship with a partner who has significant debt can be a cause for worry if the other partner has lower or no debt. However you appear TA as your immediate suggestion is that she simply not repay her parents, despite a prior agreement that, again, did not involve you. You\u2019ve stated that *you* feel \u201cmorally fine\u201d cutting ties from them, as if your opinion is the most important one here. It isn\u2019t.

What schedule, what amounts; Will it be monthly, quarterly, weekly; does she intend to always pay percentage of gross/net salary or will she pay a set monthly sum etc. Without this info, you seem to have arbitrarily convinced yourself that her debt will beggar you. \n\nYou\u2019ve stated that you and she intend to split costs 50/50. The point then would be to live aim for a rent/utilities/groceries situation where she could afford 50% of the costs. Yes if she didn\u2019t have debt the amount she would have free to cover her 50% would be higher and you would be able to afford more rent/utilities/groceries as a couple. This means that theoretically you could have a better quality of life if she wasn\u2019t paying back her parents. Ultimately you need to decide if you\u2019re willing you cohabit under these conditions, and if not you\u2019re within your moral right to not do so.

Who are you to say, they don't deserve their money back, when they have agreed to give it only under the condition of it being paid back?\n\nUnfortunately, she has debt. And she could have borrowed from a bank, what would you have said then? She would have to be paying it back and with interest on top.. unfortunately she has to pay for her poor decision.... life goes on, different people come with some sort of financial responsibilities tied to them. Will you try to find a partner only with a zero debts and commitments? Good luck. Because that is the logic behind your demand, you don't want your partner to have separate commitment.

It also would effectively isolate her. Don\u2019t make her choose between you and her parents. \n\nIf I were her I\u2019d honestly reconsider the relationship with you, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to have a family or marriage with someone who is comfortable even suggesting that she fuck over her parents financially after they all agreed to the deal. If she had taken this loan from a bank, she\u2019d have to pay. But because it came from the people who raised her and loved her her whole life, no that should have been a gift?

I really hope OP's spawn takes after his gf. \n\nOP if you cannot handle this decision, which is completely up to your GF and not yours to make. Then you should seriously reconsider having a family. You're telling everyone you can't handle the debt, then how pray tell will you handle children and the financial burden that it comes with? I'm sure you'd love it if your own kids did that to you one day.\n\nWhat are you going to do as parents when you guys will need help with the kids? Why don't you ask the parents to help... oh right, cause you completely cut ties with them. \n\nThe more mature thing to do would be to sit down and negotiate a manageable financial plan with the parents.

Wth right?", "And I feel like they would\u2019ve paid for it if she had chosen a different school, and she understood that. Like my son got a lot of financial aid to a specific school and I told him he can graduate with almost no debt if he chooses this one, if he chooses the other one that he kind of preferred He\u2019s gonna have debt. But the schools themselves are neck and neck. The one he prefers is a little bit better. And it\u2019s gonna be a lot of money for me with the first option but I want to help him.
