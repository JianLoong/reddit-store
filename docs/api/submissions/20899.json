{"id": 20899, "submission_id": "14m8zat", "title": "AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to repay her school loans to her parents?", "selftext": "**UPDATE\n\nI'm done getting lynched.**\n\nMost of those who commented **did not read my post**, did not get my point, downvoted my explainations and know FUCK ALL about me, my girfriend and our realtionship. Obviously the downvoting of my clarifications reflects the need to light up my strawman, I don't see any reason. I think I have been polite and discoursive, and I have only gottens insults back. Probably shouldn't have asked teenagers how to handle adult life. I initially kept it out of the scope of this post, but I did help her these last times, financially. I do not hold it against her and I do not want her to pay me back. I want her to have a successfull life, even if eventually we might not end up forever togheder. I don't want her to cut ties with her family, and I would hate for it to happen. That's why I suggested talking and explaining. I have been accusing of wanting to CONTROL her money. Apart from the ridiculousness of the fact that I am barely trying to control MY money, I have been getting groceries for her out of my 500 euros salary.\nI will leave this here, which I believe summarizes the situation well:\n\n> NAH - If she needs to pay 50K euros on a salary of 20K, she will not be in a position to contribute to a house or to have the time/money for children. Even if she's paying it out of her salary, that means her next 5-10 years are going to be affected by this debt. By extension, anyone who partners with her will be affected. I can't fault her for living up to the agreement with her parents. She also has been making a point of splitting costs 50/50. She acted entirely ethically. The problem is, if you're in a relationship, her debt is going to affect the life you can have together.\n\n\nI won't blame my girlfriend: I adivsed her against it but ultimately she made a choice as a 20yo something inexperienced girl, but **her parents should have known better.** Ultimately, I don't want to be the one paying 90% of the rent, utilities and food because we need to repay a useless debt. I wish to establish a thorough and well tought plan to make a family of us. Morally, its wrong to fleece her parents but its wronger to cripple us two for a decade. That makes me TA, but it makes a A that has a point. A valid one. \n\nAlso, the US are a fucked up place and honestly you should ponder how my situation, the worst kind of loan situation where I live is regarded as \"nothing bad, its just debt\" where you live. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSo my GF and I are planning to move togheder after three years of relationship, and money came up as a point of discussion. We are both fine with splitting up expenses in a 50/50 manner. We live in the EU. She is in university, I am soon to be working as a decently (but not grealty) paid government employee.\n\nThe problem is that my GF, years ago, chose to move to a big city and study at a private university instead of a public one. Her parents, likely being overconfident in their economical possibilities, decided to pay for my GF's studies but at the condition of being paid back as soon as she gets working, seeing that she could have chosen a public (and cheap) uni instead. She has to repay about 50K euros, in a country with a median net salary of 20K.\n\nMy GF's degree is not really \"marketable\" and such a debt would cripple her (ours) start in life hurting us much more than it would hurt their parents not to get the money back. As an addition, my opinion is that parents should facilitate their kids life, and they should not expect children to be economically neutral or positive to them.\n\nMy GF assured me that she would pay her parents back from her own salary. But really, that would be money coming out of our already thin paychecks and I would end up needing to compensate for her initially low, and then even lower salary after the loan payments. I told her that I do not care for her parents and I feel morally fine cutting ties with them. I told her that we, as a couple, need to make us two a priority and that I do not want to be collateral damage of her and her family irresponsible decisions. I am not suggesting to flip off her parents, but politely explain to them that we have a serious need of money and they don't. \n\nShe proceeded to get mad, reassuring me that we would not feel any monetary damage (which is literally untrue) and that eventually we will be fine.", "created_utc": 1688054919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m8zat/aita_for_not_wanting_my_girlfriend_to_repay_her/", "score": 325, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And to hear you say that you don't care for them without good cause would be another excuse to remove you from my life. If only she'd read this post to be able to see the slimy way that you describe her parents, the career she's chosen, and the debts she's accrued in pursuit of a life she wants. \n\nNews flash, dude, lots of people don't have parents who can help them in this way. They've been quite kind, and would possibly be able to help her again in the future if she needed it. Do you know how much money in interest they're saving her?!\n\nYou are in a relationship with a person who had this debt when you met her. That means you met her as the person she is, having made the decisions she has made, with the debt she has, and became her partner.

She knew what the deal was, and she accepted it. You don't just screw someone out of 50k because they have a house, car etc...As you mentioned in the comments, in your country it takes about 10years to save that much, are 10 years of her parents lives not worth as much as 10 years of your life? Do the right thing, pay the money back and yes if you can help her then great you pay it off even faster, but she made this decision, and you have a decision to either live with it or to break up and start your own life debt free, but her parents are not at fault here and should not by any means have to give up 50k because your girlfriend made a bad decision.", "LOL definitely YTA. You want your GF to reneg on an agreement / terms she made with her parents, just because you don't want to be impacted by having a partner with financial debt?\n\nGet over yourself.

You can\u2019t hold others to your own personal standards. \n\nPeople like you and I have to work twice as hard because we have our parents dragging us down on one end and a huge sense of personal responsibility for our own kids (future kids in your case) on the other end.

My husband and literally never get a break because I am constantly occupied at home and he is constantly occupied at work and we barely afford anything. Meanwhile our parents spend money on themselves as though they are royalty ($50 000 per year on clothing, massive parties, in home hired help, etc.)\n\nMy advice to you is the same as everyone on here. Don\u2019t make her cut ties with her parents. They are behaving in a socially acceptable manner and so is she. What you can do is on a personal level, try to surround yourself with people that enjoy contributing to bettering the lives of others. It is exhausting to be around people that don\u2019t have this mentality if you are a builder yourself. \n\nI will add one more thing: drop the negative attitude and get a second job. Start saving for your kids\u2019 education now. Don\u2019t become the parent you think is behaving in a morally reprehensible manner.

She owes her parents the money, she should pay back the money.\n\nHowever, OP keeps asking 'what should I do?', so I'd love to try and help. I'm a 35 yr old from the US, btw... not a teenager. And yes, our views on debt and student loans are fucked. We know!\n\nThis situation is fairly common, though, so you might consider the advice. I graduated from grad school + undergrad with 15k in student loans. I started my first job at roughly 32k per year. My partner (been together 11 years, always kept finances separate), also had about the same in student loans, but is a few years older and was making triple what I was. When we moved in together, we had similar conversations - how do we divide rent, utilities, etc, while also having our own expenses (debt). We ALWAYS split bills 50/50, even with the disparity in income. I just made sure to share with him what I could afford, as the one making less. Some people talk about splitting based on % of income. Personally, I never wanted that, but you just have to do whats best for the two people in the relationship.  \n\nAll that to say/and I think what a lot of people are saying to you is - LIVE WITHIN YOUR MEANS. When you look at housing, utilities, or anything that is SHARED, make sure its in your budget. By 'your', I mean the both of you. This might mean you dont live in as nice of an apt/home as you might down the road, but you're just starting out! She needs to create a budget that includes repaying her parents. She has the luxury of not paying interest, so its just a matter of chipping away at the debt. \n\nWill she always make that salary, or are there opportunities for her career to grow? If it's her first job out of uni, she can only go up from there! (barring any kind of drastic career change)\n\nThis is just life. It sucks. And yes, she + her parents made a financially irresponsible decision at the start of your relationship, but not repaying them at all would likely ruin the relationship with her parents. Is that worth it? Could she speak with them about a payment plan + timeline to repay? Or even bring the amount down SOME, on good faith that it will help the two of you start your lives? Those could be worth exploring. But just saying 'sorry, not repaying it!' is an aggressive choice that isnt going to end well for anyone.", "YTA. Unfortunately the only person to blame here is your girlfriend, she made an incredibly stupid financial decision which I agree her parents shouldn\u2019t have supported.

Hopefully they will let her setup a payment plan so that she can still pay for herself & it doesn\u2019t all fall onto you. Perhaps she can get a second job for a little while? I do sympathise as someone who married a person with debt, the first few years of my relationship I supported my partner financially whilst living together. He\u2019s steadily made more money over the years and we are now comfortably splitting everything 50/50 as his debt is paid off. However, when we do buy a house for example, it will be my savings we use as he has almost nothing. Could I wait 10 years for him to save enough to by a house? Sure. Though I\u2019m not going to stop living my life/pushing back goals because of his poor financial decisions. It\u2019s really not fair, but I love him and that enough for me.

Your girlfriend and the repayment are a package deal since before she met you, so you take it or leave it, no alternatives.

And if that damages the relationship, then don't be together. But by no means are you in a position to suggest cutting ties with her family.

But it doesn\u2019t matter that you don\u2019t want to pay it, she HAS to pay it back. It\u2019s done and decided, she owes that money. You don\u2019t just get to decide that you want to be with her so her income and yours are now conjoined and you don\u2019t have to honor any obligations she has that you disagree with. This is not a matter of debate, she WILL have to pay that money back. The decision to spend it was hers, she knew her options. You are extremely self-centered in that you seem to think your wants are a priority. \n\nYour choices are not pay her parents back or not. She has to pay them back.

Many other women don\u2019t have this debt, date one of them. If you want to be with your girlfriend then much like her having to pay for the private school she wanted you can deal with her making these payments. And the stupid moral/logical fallacy you\u2019ve latched to is irrelevant because this isn\u2019t about you at all. In fact, it has absolutely nothing to do with you. Before you respond with \u201cI\u2019d have to make up the additional monies from my salary\u201d please realize you do not have to if you do not live with her. You wanting to live with her does not supersede her debt. How do you seriously think you figure into this equation at all as you do not even live together currently?

If it was a bank, would you be telling her she shouldn't repay her loans to the bank at all? \n\nYou need to sit down and make a budget together and think about how to allocate it and how both you and her will contribute to shared expenses. If this doesn't work for you then maybe you shouldn't be moving in together.

I\u2019m unclear why her degree would not be marketable and it is lousy that post secondary is so ridiculously expensive but you\u2019re not really working with her towards a viable solution.  I worked 2-3 jobs in my 20\u2019s to get ahead.  Perhaps both of you could consider that to plan the pay down.  She should be more aware of financial impact/cost of living but as you said, it probably wasn\u2019t really taught so now she has a hard lesson.  If you\u2019re saving for a house just get it in your name until you know for sure the longevity of your relationship.  You could rent a room in a shared house until she gets more paid down.  Everyone I know made sacrifices in their 20\u2019s for their own future.\nYTA because you\u2019re so flippant about her cutting off ties with her parents.  Not cool.  Not paying them back, also not ok.  I like that you\u2019re wanting independence because you clearly haven\u2019t thought through any potential inheritance from them.   \nErasing the deal and the past decisions aren\u2019t possible so you need to support her in finding solutions.  She\u2019s probably embarrassed about it.  Reality has arrived and her working more is a reasonable start.

They just think YTA and that she needs to pay her parents back because that was part of the deal.", "It absolutely is an asshole move to not pay back a debt. You basically want to cut off her parents to save some money.", "Everyone read your post, understood your point and your explanations. It doesn\u2019t stop you being the AH. You are the one who has asked the question but has no interest in listening to any answers. We are not all kids on here either and you sound very immature and self centred in how you think. You also sound like someone who never listens and always thinks they are right. Not a great combination. \n\nWhat do you know about her parents situation? You say they have a house and a car already. But what are their retirement plans? If average salaries are around 20k then 50k could be a big part of their retirement savings. You wanting to avoid repaying a loan made in good faith could mean her parents having to work several more years. They may have borrowed the money they used to pay for the education she asked them to fund. I bet you don\u2019t have any idea about where they got the money or what they plan to do with it when it gets repaid. \n\nParents will generally do what they can afford to do for their children. Your arrogant assumption that they can just swallow a 50k loss to ease your early life absolutely does make you the AH. \n\nAs to you being morally ok with cutting off her parents - just wow.", "You are only looking for people to agree with you. \n\nIt's a huge red flag to suggest cutting ties with her family in order to get out of paying this debt. If her meeting obligations she agreed to before meeting you is problematic for you, then you should end the relationship. Allow her the opportunity to meet someone with ethics that respects her and her family.", "You are a horrible human being.  Get out of this girl\u2019s life.  She needs a better man than you will ever be.\n\nWhat a whiny toddler you are.", "Wow. I have NEVER seen someone get the title of MEGA ASSHOLE before. But you definitely deserve it, OP. YTA.", "How mature are you?  Sneak away from a debt?  Really?  This is a verbal contract between your girlfriend and her parents, not you.  How often do you sneak away from responsibility?  This is being a responsible adult, paying off your debts regardless where the loan came from.", "Take her as she is, debt and all, or break up", "Honestly, I suggest you get some professional legal advice.", "OP already considers her earnings to be his. The abuse has already started, hope she realizes and escapes.", "Not just commented , commented AND awarded \ud83d\ude29", "I think most of us want to believe we're good people, deep down. I've done things myself that have shattered said perception of myself - done some shitty things that I regret, that hurt other people, and I had to come to terms with \"yeah, that wasn't very cool of me, I am not as nice as I like to think I am.\" But for the most part, we take these opportunities to learn and better ourselves.\n\nI think a lot of true assholes like this though, want to have their cake and eat it too, so to say. They do shitty asshole things but want internet strangers to absolve them of any potential negative feelings as a result - or at least, the judgment of others in their life that might be affecting them.", "> who want to be told the aren't the TA and firmly believe if they can control the narrative, they can get that response.\n\nThen just imagine... this dude thought he was controlling the narrative with a series  of dead to rights asshole moments (\"Let's not pay back your debts, to your family, because it means less money *for me*, and if that means losing your parents I don't care... I don't really like them anyways.  Its there own fault for lending you money to get a shit degree anyways!\")  \n\nIs he just this self unaware, or is it possible its even ***WORSE*** then he's actually claiming and this just the framed interpretation!?!", "I'm old enough to be their parent if they're just coming out of college. Yet I guess I don't know anything about adulting and finances.", "Thats why I am always so skeptical about in-law posts here - they cant ALL be awful.", "Coolest idea I ever heard from parents with kids that insisted on paying unwanted rent/etc (if you truly don't want the money back) is putting it into an account and waiting for a big life event (looking for a house, getting married) and giving her the money she paid to you then. You sound like you have a great kid.", "It speaks to me of a person, who thinks actions shouldn't have consequences, if the consequences are annoying for him.\n\nI don't want to associate with such people.", "You write a whole ass two paragraphs, but at the end of the day if you needed 50k, you wouldn't give it away.  \"Sorry, can't afford it, guess you're going to the free college\".\n\nI'm not commending on what (derogatory name) wants his girlfriend to do, just the idea that \"how do you know they don't need it more than you\" using basic logical skills that *if they needed it they wouldn't have given it away*.  I *personally* think they should break up if it's that big a deal, since he doesn't get a say in that agreement (the only thing he gets a say in, in this situation, is his relationship status and/or combining finances)", "This.  I hope she runs from this jerk as fast as she can.  \n\nCan you imagine if they have children?  \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to feed these mooches. I am morally ok with cutting off contact with these little shits.  They don\u2019t bring ANYTHING to the table.\u201d", "Im just happy I got to share in this moment with all of you.\n\nEdit - oh and for all the easy karma. This is a gold mine.", "This is what I was trying to convey. All of us have been TA at some point or other and likely will be again. The difference is a lot of people learn from the experience, make amends, and do better. And there are people here who definitely do that. But there are also people who want to use AITA to not only soothe themselves. And it's always fun to watch that blow up in their faces.", "I think technically I am too (38) based on some of the ages of people in these subs who have kids.", "So don't move in with her.  That's your option right there.", "> objectively speaking, they need the money less\n\nToo bad that\u2019s not how loans work", "No, again, that's not true. Some people are willing to risk shit for their children. My parents' definitely don't have money for anything, but if tomorrow I said I needed money to go back to school, or to move abroad, they would figure out a way to help me get it without taking on debt early. They would sell the house, their car, their jewellery, anything I needed if it meant they could act as an alternative to a bank. Maybe her parents are the same, maybe not, maybe they have a similar mindset, we don't know. And for that reason I feel uncomfortable deciding who needs it more. \n\nAnd they definitely need money, but they would rather be living uncomfortably for a while than have me take out loans. They have seen how quickly large debt can fuck lives up, and they would rather my sister and I not end up there. But obviously when I'm reaping the rewards of their sacrifice, they do expect me to return it. And I will readily oblige.", "I wonder what they\u2019re going to call this guy in future Reddit threads."]}
