{"id": 20899, "submission_id": "14m8zat", "title": "AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to repay her school loans to her parents?", "selftext": "**UPDATE\n\nI'm done getting lynched.**\n\nMost of those who commented **did not read my post**, did not get my point, downvoted my explainations and know FUCK ALL about me, my girfriend and our realtionship. Obviously the downvoting of my clarifications reflects the need to light up my strawman, I don't see any reason. I think I have been polite and discoursive, and I have only gottens insults back. Probably shouldn't have asked teenagers how to handle adult life. I initially kept it out of the scope of this post, but I did help her these last times, financially. I do not hold it against her and I do not want her to pay me back. I want her to have a successfull life, even if eventually we might not end up forever togheder. I don't want her to cut ties with her family, and I would hate for it to happen. That's why I suggested talking and explaining. I have been accusing of wanting to CONTROL her money. Apart from the ridiculousness of the fact that I am barely trying to control MY money, I have been getting groceries for her out of my 500 euros salary.\nI will leave this here, which I believe summarizes the situation well:\n\n> NAH - If she needs to pay 50K euros on a salary of 20K, she will not be in a position to contribute to a house or to have the time/money for children. Even if she's paying it out of her salary, that means her next 5-10 years are going to be affected by this debt. By extension, anyone who partners with her will be affected. I can't fault her for living up to the agreement with her parents. She also has been making a point of splitting costs 50/50. She acted entirely ethically. The problem is, if you're in a relationship, her debt is going to affect the life you can have together.\n\n\nI won't blame my girlfriend: I adivsed her against it but ultimately she made a choice as a 20yo something inexperienced girl, but **her parents should have known better.** Ultimately, I don't want to be the one paying 90% of the rent, utilities and food because we need to repay a useless debt. I wish to establish a thorough and well tought plan to make a family of us. Morally, its wrong to fleece her parents but its wronger to cripple us two for a decade. That makes me TA, but it makes a A that has a point. A valid one. \n\nAlso, the US are a fucked up place and honestly you should ponder how my situation, the worst kind of loan situation where I live is regarded as \"nothing bad, its just debt\" where you live. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSo my GF and I are planning to move togheder after three years of relationship, and money came up as a point of discussion. We are both fine with splitting up expenses in a 50/50 manner. We live in the EU. She is in university, I am soon to be working as a decently (but not grealty) paid government employee.\n\nThe problem is that my GF, years ago, chose to move to a big city and study at a private university instead of a public one. Her parents, likely being overconfident in their economical possibilities, decided to pay for my GF's studies but at the condition of being paid back as soon as she gets working, seeing that she could have chosen a public (and cheap) uni instead. She has to repay about 50K euros, in a country with a median net salary of 20K.\n\nMy GF's degree is not really \"marketable\" and such a debt would cripple her (ours) start in life hurting us much more than it would hurt their parents not to get the money back. As an addition, my opinion is that parents should facilitate their kids life, and they should not expect children to be economically neutral or positive to them.\n\nMy GF assured me that she would pay her parents back from her own salary. But really, that would be money coming out of our already thin paychecks and I would end up needing to compensate for her initially low, and then even lower salary after the loan payments. I told her that I do not care for her parents and I feel morally fine cutting ties with them. I told her that we, as a couple, need to make us two a priority and that I do not want to be collateral damage of her and her family irresponsible decisions. I am not suggesting to flip off her parents, but politely explain to them that we have a serious need of money and they don't. \n\nShe proceeded to get mad, reassuring me that we would not feel any monetary damage (which is literally untrue) and that eventually we will be fine.", "created_utc": 1688054919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14m8zat/aita_for_not_wanting_my_girlfriend_to_repay_her/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do believe my suggestion is a spicy one, but my own family would never expect me to pay them back and I would never expect my hypothetical children to pay me back.

If only she'd read this post to be able to see the slimy way that you describe her parents, the career she's chosen, and the debts she's accrued in pursuit of a life she wants. \n\nNews flash, dude, lots of people don't have parents who can help them in this way. They've been quite kind, and would possibly be able to help her again in the future if she needed it. Do you know how much money in interest they're saving her?!\n\nYou are in a relationship with a person who had this debt when you met her. That means you met her as the person she is, having made the decisions she has made, with the debt she has, and became her partner.

She knew what the deal was, and she accepted it. You don't just screw someone out of 50k because they have a house, car etc...As you mentioned in the comments, in your country it takes about 10years to save that much, are 10 years of her parents lives not worth as much as 10 years of your life? Do the right thing, pay the money back and yes if you can help her then great you pay it off even faster, but she made this decision, and you have a decision to either live with it or to break up and start your own life debt free, but her parents are not at fault here and should not by any means have to give up 50k because your girlfriend made a bad decision.", "LOL definitely YTA. You want your GF to reneg on an agreement / terms she made with her parents, just because you don't want to be impacted by having a partner with financial debt?\n\nGet over yourself.
