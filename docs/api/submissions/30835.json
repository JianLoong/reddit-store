In addition she has three friends who sleep here often (including in the week when they have school). In addition Janes boyfriend stays the night here, in her room regularly. \n\nI have no issue the children having friends round / to stay but it\u2019s constant. My wife believes it\u2019s a good thing they are comfortable enough to stay here and that they have a \u2018safe\u2019 place to be. I think this comes from her own teenager years where she would spend nights in the city with her friends. \n\nIn addition I do not want my children to think they can have their friends and boyfriends / girlfriends staying here when they reach the age of 16. Especially without any notice on a Tuesday night. \n\nEvery time I try to raise this issue, my wife says it\u2019s her daughters house as well - and that the teens are harmless.

You have the right to want a couple of nights without friends over. The mother has the right to raise her child how she wants to. Having constant friends over is not a terrible thing unless they are disruptive. You mentioned they are eating your food, does your wife contribute to the food bills? If so your up a creek without a paddle on that argument. It sounds like your wife had a different childhood then you and realizes there are way worse things these kids could be doing then eating chips in your living room. Are the boyfriends parents as strict as you are with people staying over? Is it safer for them to spend time together at your house then try to spend nights together in random areas of where you live? If the kids are at your home at least you know what there doing, most parents I grew up around would rather us hang out at there house then being out doing stupid teen stuff with no parental supervision. I honestly would rather my kids and there friends hang out at my house then doing stupid teen stuff god knows where. I do think it would be fair to talk to the mother about having days with no friends, but don\u2019t expect your step daughter to want to be around those days. I also grew up in a house with step siblings and understood they had different rules due to the situation, your kids will to. This is just a side effect of two families meshing together, sometimes the prices don\u2019t line up and as the adult in the situation you have to navigate these situations. Your kids are smart, talk with them as they get older about your expectations. Also, you might want to think about if you would rather your kids hanging out with their friends eating chips on your couch then out who knows where.", ">In addition I do not want my children to think they can have their friends and boyfriends / girlfriends staying here when they reach the age of 16.\n\nBoy are you in for a surprise!\n\nTeens often roam and gather in packs. Often, if they're lucky, there's a house or two where they are welcomed to hang out safely. It was like that back in my day, my parents' day, and currently in my nibling's world. It's part of their socializing.\n\nAbsolutely forbidding that is the wrong approach, but you and your partner can work out ... something. Certain days of the week where no one is allowed, or everyone must leave by a reasonable hour on a school night.\n\nSoft YTA.", "NTA. You guys have an equal say in who lives or can visit your place and a lot of the other commenters are ignoring the fact that the wife is basically deciding that a bunch of people can basically live at the house spending the night the majority of the week without caring about the other people that life there. Besides having to spend a bunch of extra money on food not being able to hang out in your own living room would suck and in general not feeling comfortable in your own house would suck.", "NTA. Having them over from time to time is okay, but them practically living there is not. They have their own homes. I also understand the frustration with them eating your food that you buy for your family, not other people's kids. You and your wife (+ Jane) need to have a serious discussion.", "I don\u2019t think anyone is being an ah here, but clearly you two have different philosophies. I\u2019d rather have the house that my kids and their friends come to. I agree with your wife that she wants to be a safe space for everyone. Plus, for me, I want to know who my kids are hanging out with and I\u2019d rather they be at my home than doing other dumb things out in the world. \n\nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with the bf sleeping over, and I would put limits on school night stays. Also, if feeding all of those kids is genuinely affecting you financially, I would understand cutting back.", "Personally, I think there should be some limits. Having teenagers isn't easy, and ideally you do want to keep some eyes on them. I don't agree with sleepovers on school nights and DEFINITELY NO boyfriends at 16yrs sleeping over....all that being said, I think teens constantly in your place is something you can certainly have an issue with.

At the same time, it\u2019s your home also. You and your wife need to find some compromises. It\u2019s reasonable for her to want to be a safe space for teens to hang out. It\u2019s also reasonable to not want kids aside from y\u2019all\u2019s in your space all the time. There is a lot of middle ground here.", "NTA. You both need to come up with a compromise. Allow them over one night per week or weekends only. This is your home and your two daughters home too. Having company should be a two yes situation, she should be considering you in this as well.\n\nI grew up with a brother that did this, and there were people over all the time. Taking over the living room, taking over the tv, eating everything in the house. My siblings and I didn't feel comfortable being able to wear our pj's first thing in the morning with messy hair without a comment \"That's attractive\", etc. from these guys. \n\nDuring the week when school is in session the kids should be able to come home, do their homework, have dinner, and have family time without always having someone else's company over.", "NTA.  I have a 16 and 18 year old and kids are over here lots.  One of the things I liked about my house was that it had a developed walk out basement.  So my kids can have guests and not be in my face.  We have a perfect set up.  But there are no sleep overs on work nights.  And there are plenty of guest free nights.  It\u2019s all about balance. It does not sound like you don\u2019t want her ever having people over.  The boyfriend sleeping over in her room would not fly with me either.  Yes I know they will have sex if they want at 16.  I did.  But I\u2019m sure not going to crank the Barry White tunes and throw rose petals on the bed for them.  They don\u2019t get to behave like adults living together when they are still children in my house.", "NAH. You both chose to parent your own kids how you want and this is how she wants to parent her kid. I do understand your point of view, not necessarily agree but understand.", "I would approach it as a house rule thing and not about parenting. Like a roommate agreement. If the daughter were a roommate, it wouldn\u2019t be ok for people to be there all the time and there would be days that were no visit days because of school. We housed several teens when my kids were younger and this is how we approached it.", "There are 2 different issues here. Are you unhappy the teen friends are always around eating your food and taking up room in your living room? Then bring that specifically up and set some house rules.\n\nBUT if your concern is just the example set for your kids being different rules. You just have to talk with your kids about it. This is part of being a mixed household.", "INFO:  Who owns the house? \n\nIt might be time to ask yourself if you want to continue to live like this because it sounds as if your wife likes things the way they are. Or put another way, are you willing to stay married to her if the situation remains the same. Jane is setting a horrible example for your kids and that's another factor to keep in mind.", "NTA.  Your wife is making it abundantly clear that she does not respect you, and that is a problem.  \n\nIt is also not great for you to routinely have girls that age overnighting at your house.  The second one of them doesn't get what they want, you are one false allegation away from a world of hurt.", "NAH but as it's already been agreed that she parents her own child I'm not sure it would be right for you to put your foot down now. \n\nMy mum found out my older sister when she was 16 was sleeping with her bf and staying the night and she didn't like it but eventually  decided it was better to know where her daughter was and that she was safe about it.", "Yeah, as a parent I wouldn\u2019t give AF about the whole \u2018boyfriend staying the night,\u2019 but would give many, many F\u2019s about having any damn person staying on random weeknights, staying most nights of the week, etc.  I need my house to mostly be a private, safe space for me to decompress, relax, and take all of my socialization masks off.  So NTA.\n\nConsider approaching the subject from a roommate standpoint:  both have to be comfortable, so both have to compromise.  You don\u2019t want people over, she wants people over all the time, the compromise is only certain specific days a week can people stay.

People did visit during the week, but it was usually something we asked about first.\r  \n\r  \nIt's generally good for people that age to have a safe place to come to on weekends, and in emergencies, I think.\r  \n\r  \nThat said, OP makes it sound like it's about half the time that other teens are essentially living in the house. \r  \n\r  \nWhy don't their parents feed them? Why can't they sleep at home?

Does she get time to indulge in hobbies, chill by herself, study, prepare for her future? Does she have/see other friends, or go out?\r  \n\r  \nI'd suggest asking her about the above things, in a gentle way.\r  \n\r  \nOP's concerns are valid, too.

OP and his wife can teach Jane how to share space by example.\r  \n\r  \nAs for Jane's boyfriend, I  think it's best for them to have a safe place to spend time together. But only if Jane's mother has educated her well on the associated health risks and the protections available, and is maintaining open communication with her to make sure the guy is not pressuring her to do things she doesn't want or forego protection, and that he is not monopolizing her time in an unhealthy way. He is unlikely to be the romantic be-all and end-all for her, so she should learn to view the relationship in perspective. It's not strange that they might want to spend the night together, but you would do well to wonder why it seems to happen so often. \r  \n\r  \nAs I said above, it's good to make sure Jane knows she gets to--and should--draw boundaries, be alone, and think about herself and what she wants. And that others she lives with and will live with have boundaries and want privacy. \r  \n\r  \nJust need to add that I'm approaching this from the persepectve of an introvert.

Huh, weird.", "Another commenter said it somewhere else in a more articulate way, but what I mean is that part of raising a well adjusted kid is fostering their ability to be independent in the sense of being able to feel fulfilled in your alone time. At that age you\u2019re still figuring out who you are, how to regulate your well being, etc and it\u2019s _so_ easy to become codependent. Kids need plenty of time with their friends but they also need time to be alone so they can learn to be confident in and content with who they are outside of their friendships. Especially because it\u2019s unlikely high school relationships will last a lifetime in their original form. These are skills that will help them navigate experiences like dorm life, making friends as an adult, etc better. \n\nAs for what I mean about their romantic partnerships, all of the above but with the added element of how easy it is to become overly entangled with romantic partners. Especially as a teen. I personally don\u2019t think allowing children to engage in relationships the same way adults do (spending every day with your partner, sharing a bed with them most nights, etc) is healthy. They of course want to play house and feel like they are adults but there\u2019s plenty of time to explore that once you are older and better equipped to handle the emotional consequences of that. Especially, I think, for young women who are more often at risk of being abused or taken advantage of in domestic relationships. Cohabitating with and enmeshing your entire life with every partner you have isn\u2019t a great precedent to set for yourself. Especially when you\u2019re at an age where every relationship feels so important. Having your own space and boundaries as the default before making the decision to invite a partner into your life is a better approach, I think. \n\nTo me it\u2019s similar to not having sex with every single person you go on a date with when you\u2019re in high school. I\u2019m sex positive and think teens will of course sleep with each other, but I think it would be remiss not to teach your children that there are emotional consequences to some sexual relationships, and you don\u2019t have to have that connection with everyone. especially when you\u2019re in a position where you\u2019re inherently not at your peak of emotional maturity/haven\u2019t fully developed. But that\u2019s a different topic, I\u2019m just trying to flesh out why I think teens need to be taught how to set boundaries for themselves. \n\n\nIn this particular context I think it would be more beneficial to limit friends coming over to maybe five days a week. Or maybe just sleepovers on weekends. Maybe a weeknight if it\u2019s a special occasion. For partners maybe we don\u2019t normalize boyfriends sleeping in your 16 year olds bed most nights, but it\u2019s fine once and a while for a holiday or trip or something. I guess ultimately what I\u2019m saying is that  it\u2019s important to remember that teens aren\u2019t adults and shouldn\u2019t be encouraged to live like they are.", "I\u2019m sorry, but I disagree with this. They shouldn\u2019t just be welcomed with open doors every single time they feel like it. Your home is your space, and haven\u2019t constant guests that aren\u2019t even yours removes the peace that should come with being in your own home. I\u2019m voting NTA and it\u2019s a serious marital conversation that needs to be had.", "Okay I can barely read what you\u2019re saying because it\u2019s a wall of text. \n\nI\u2019m not saying the kids are out of control partying. We weren\u2019t being rowdy or throwing ragers either. But we were engaging in adult behavior way more often than we should have been and were given way too much opportunity to do so. And no, OP and his wife would not always know if the kids are drinking or getting high. It\u2019s naive to think the kids appreciate OPs house because all of them have military sergeant abusive parents who won\u2019t let them watch tv or have friends over. It\u2019s \u201cthe house\u201d because they get way more freedom than any other parent they know allows. Why would they go home if they get to feel like adults being housed and fed for free whenever they want?\n\nEither the kids are going to be doing everything anyway so why not let them do it there, or they aren\u2019t doing anything illegal. So which is it?\n\nThese kids are being able to have a boundary-less social experience that should be reserved for special occasions or adulthood. It\u2019s not healthy, in my opinion, for kids (namely daughter and bf) to be playing married couple/roommates so often. That\u2019s unhealthy emotional entanglement for that maturity level. Even being able to stay up till 1am eating pizza and giggling with your friends every Tuesday school night is poor form for children who are still needing to learn how to manage their responsibilities and wellbeing. It\u2019s not malicious but that doesn\u2019t make it positive either. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference in knowing your child will be sexually actively and having a relationship with them where they are prepared to be safe and feel comfortable talking to you about it and giving your minor daughter to opportunity to play house/be a grown up every single night. Just like it\u2019s one thing to teach your kid about alcohol safety and make yourself someone they call when they\u2019re in trouble versus openly letting them drink whenever they want. Not that OPs doing the latter, but drawing a comparison between why there need to be limits on things. \n\nAnyway, I digress but you and OPs wife are very naive if you think the kids aren\u2019t taking full advantage of the situation.", "My thoughts as well. I hope OP\u2019s wife is okay raising a baby, because teens are not good with birth control. OP should also have equal say in a bunch of kids in their house during the week.

You are making my exact point though, what OP is most mad at is that he will have a hard time with his \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d parenting style, which is often just code for lazy parenting and is often extremely ineffective.", "When they first agreed to have separate parenting styles that probably didn\u2019t include \u201clet teenage daughter have friends over all the time\u201d in the fine print. The main issue is that they\u2019re over All. The. Time. If your roommate, housemate, spouse, kid, whatever constantly had extra people over eating your food how would you react?", "Well if the kids are good kids then they can be trusted and won\u2019t need to be so regimented. Personally I just understood as a teen that sleepovers with boys weren\u2019t a thing. But I also didn\u2019t grow up watching my older stepsister get to do it, so it would probably seem unfair. I\u2019d probably get it cuz different parents in charge but like still, teenage angst. \n\nAnd what about what\u2019s on daughters plate? You keep insinuating I\u2019m criticizing her. The daughter isn\u2019t the issue, she seems like a good kid. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure if you can read or like comprehend what I\u2019m saying. I literally said before that what OP is mostly annoyed about is the constant guests over. You keep hypothesizing that he\u2019s going to be some over controlling parent in the future which no one knows how that\u2019s going to end up. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t even really seem to care personally that the daughter has a boy over, just that he doesn\u2019t want his kids to expect that in the future because he personally doesn\u2019t want that for his parenting style with them."]}
