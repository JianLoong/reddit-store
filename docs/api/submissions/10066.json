After she was delivered the doctor was easily able to find out that there had been an issue with the cord and she simply wasn't getting what she needed to survive, so she died in the womb. It was no ones fault and could not have been helped or prevented, just a terrible accident. \n\nI was 6 months pregnant so everyone knew we were expecting. My husband (29m) has a huge family, and everyone is super close and talk everyday and most of them live together. \n\nI told my family what happened immediately, but my husband asked to tell his family on his own. I said okay, I understand he needs some time with this and I understand he lost as much as I did. \n\nThe problem came up this morning. I reminded him every 2-3 days that he really needed to tell his family. I offered to do it for him more times than I can count. He would occasionally make excuses where he'd say he needed to \"do the dishes\" or \"wash the car\" and didnt have time to call them, so I would do whatever excuse he was using so he had time, just to come back and he still had not done it. I finally told him yesterday that if he would tell them then I would do it this morning, and I followed through. It had been over 3 weeks since she died at this point. In this time I had missed dozens of calls and texts from his family asking how we were/how the baby was/if we wanted to come over for dinner/that they bought us a pack of diapers because Costco had a sale. I had ignored every single member of his family because he kept telling me he would \"get around to it\". I've honestly barely seen my husband over these past few weeks. He goes to either our guest room or office and just sits on his phone. I've left him alone and given him space, but I've also been doing all of the funeral arrangements, paperwork, handling what we need for our work LOA's, handling the insurance and taking care of our house and other kids all on my own.\n\nAnyways, he was absolutely shocked that I actually did it, I'm not sure why. He's been locking in our spare room all morning now texting me all kinds of nasty things that I'm ignoring, and telling me that I ruined his relationship with his family now and accusing me of not loving or caring about our dead daughter.\n\nI understand my husband is grieving, and I feel awful that he's having a hard time, but dodging texts and calls from 20 people for weeks and pretending like everything was fine has been exhausting. It feels like he's trying to ignore that it ever happened and while I'll never forget our daughter we have to move on with our lives.\n\nI think I definitely crossed a boundary, but I also think I was in the right to.

Additionally, you should be recovering from childbirth. Has he been taking care of you at all? \n\nYou did NOT cross a boundary. One, you have the right to share your loss with whomever you choose and two, again, he has not only left all of the burden on you and has not let you grieve or recover, he also left you to play pretend for weeks so he could lock himself in a room or \"do the dishes.\" Honestly you should have done it weeks ago. Your recovering and grieving process has been stalled or interrupted for weeks now.", "NTA\n\nUnless there's something absolutely strange about the way his family reacts to the news of a stillborn, if his relationship with his family is \"ruined,\" he did it himself. By not telling them about your stillborn baby for three entire weeks.", "NTA.\n\nThe family needed to be told.  3+ weeks is enough time to tell them.  Your husband is having a very difficult time and maybe some therapy/counseling would help him with his grief.\n\nThis could not be hidden forever.", "You showed him an immense amount of love to wait as long as you did. I would've given him 2 days. NTA.", "NTA - They are your family too! Husband put you in an extremely awkward situation for weeks, all while you are also grieving.", "NTA .. you\u2019re not only dealing with postpartum hormones, but also with the loss of a child (sending love) \n\nLike you said, you asked and reminded him for weeks. Avoiding family is exhausting! So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong. Wishing you peace and healing mama \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "Nta what the heck is up with him that he ignores his wife who had to go through the actual carrying of the stillborn", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nFirst: I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nI cannot imagine the amount of grief you feel. \n\nYou should not have to be carrying on with life alone, managing the household and funeral affairs.\n\n___\n\nSecondly, your husbands family would have learned of your loss one way or another. Like. Im not really sure what his thought process could have been here???? If they werent told, there would be a point they would figure it out given you were no longer pregnant and couldn't show them your newborn.\n\nIf family doesn't know what happened, you cannot lean on them for emotional support in the grieving process. So if you were ready for his family to know, then you were absolutely in the right to tell them.\n\n___\n\nSo again, absolutely NTA. You had every right to tell your husbands family. I hope they are able to provide you with the support you need and deserve right now. Sending much love your way.", "NTA. This was your news to share as much as it was his, regardless of who is biologically related to whom. I mean, if you had no relationship whatsoever with his family, that would be one thing, but you were actively trying to dodge their communications.\n\nPart of me wants to say NAH, because it sounds like he's just responding to grief in a different way... but locking himself in a room and sending you hateful text messages feels clearly out of line.\n\nI would super highly recommend therapy for both of you, or at least a grief support group.", "NTA\n\nHe is grieving and trying to process it, I would wager he doesn\u2019t want to tell people because it makes it real. But eventually you have to let people know, especially since it was probably close to baby shower time and people are shopping for gifts.", "NTA. I'm a big proponent of \"everyone gets to grieve their own way\" but not if it involves requiring your (also grieving) wife to lie and hide and wear a pillow to a baby shower (because that's where this was heading).\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your loss, OP.", "NTA.\n\nYes he is grieving but you are too. Time to get him into counseling. We lost our first child. I miscarried. For the longest time (maybe only 6 months, felt like forever). I felt it was my fault. We were in a book store and I found myself in that section. After 1 or 2 chapters, I was better.\n\nIn your case not the same. Do not know what exactly he is feeling but he needs help. Also ask his family for no pressure until you and then hubby and find a path.\n\nIf you want to chat, IM me.", "I delivered stillborn twins a few months ago, and you are NTA. Your husband is absolutely grieving but so are you. It is not fair that all practical things are falling to you, as well as the emotional heavy lifting of informing people, all while you are physically recovering from birth (you're probably still bleeding pretty heavily, I was at three weeks out) as well as having your hormones go wild on you.\n\nIdeally, he should be taking a lot of this off of your shoulders or, if you are physically up to some of it, doing it TOGETHER. My husband and I held our babies and said goodbye together. We went to the funeral home and made decisions together. We told people sort of together (mostly via text as we'd been keeping our nearest and dearest informed when I went into the hospital). We went to pick up their urns together. In a couple of weeks, on what would have been their due date, we will go scatter their ashes together. We have decided to try again for another baby, and will deal together with the emotional turmoil that that will bring.\n\nTogether. Because we are PARTNERS. We are a team. Because the only thing that lessens pain like this is being able to share it with someone who really understands.\n\nYour husband may be in pain, but you do not deserve this. Sending you great love.", "I am so sorry for your loss, OP. \n\nNTA. Your husband asked to break the news to his family and then promptly refused to do so. He put you in an impossible situation and you did the best you could with it. Yes, he's grieving and grief hits everyone differently, but he should still be there when you need him. Any fallout from his family could've been avoided if he'd just told them like he said he would.", "NTA. Every inquiry you fielded from his family, while knowing that they didn't know, was an intrusion on your grief. That was unfair to you. Yes, people grieve differently, but I'm not sure what he or anyone else expected from you in this situation. Were you supposed to lie, or allow people to keep buying things for the baby?  Wait until the funeral was scheduled maybe? The two of you should be grieving your loss together, but you can't force him to support you, nor can you force him to accept support from you. You're trying to survive this and heal, just like him. He's dealing with the mental and emotional toll. You have that and the physical toll to deal with, including hormonal changes. You haven't had the opportunity to fall apart, because you've been dealing with the hard realities of your situation. Don't beat him up, but don't beat yourself up either. You're doing your best and your best is pretty damn good at this point.", "NTA, I would say NAH but your husband being nasty to you is assholish. \n\nIt is really fucked up that he is acting like he's the only one grieving and pushing all the work onto you. \n\nI understand that he may take reminders every few days as pushing stress onto him, but his family kept contacting you. \n\nBy not telling them it deprives you both of potential emotional support which is very needed in these circumstances. \n\nI don't understand how you telling them ruins his relationship with them. How long did he expect you to suffer alone (he's obviously not providing you support, you're even doing his chores) and in silence? \n\nIt's okay for him to grieve, it's expected that in only three weeks he is not over it. No matter how much you're getting done, you're not \"over it\" either. You're in survival mode, pushing down your grief, because if you don't take care of things (funeral, chores) they won't get done. \n\nAnd if you suddenly stopped doing all house chores and didn't arrange the funeral, what do you think his reaction would be? \n\nHonestly I do feel that he is taking out his grief onto you. You deserve better than to be his emotional dumpster. Especially after you've birthed his children, and your daughter was literally a part of your body for six months. \n\nThis honestly sounds like an Encanto \"Under Pressure\" situation to me. \n\nIt's fair to cut him some slack as he is grieving, but he still needs to take accountability for his actions. You're both grieving, taking it out on each other does not help. Grief carried together is lighter, but grief thrown at others hits both parties twice as hard. \n\nI wish you peace and healing in the coming months and years. Hopefully both you and your husband will be in a better place soon.", "NTH\nIt sounds as though he felt by not telling his family, then she wasn't really gone. Now that they know, it solidifies that she passed. You had to tell them. Hopefully they can help you both during this difficult time. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. NTA. Did you give him a deadline? I can\u2019t imagine your pain and feelings, and it says a lot of good that you\u2019re acknowledging that it\u2019s his loss too (too often, everyone focuses solely on the mother). Have you gotten the help and support you need from family and friends?", "I am very sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA I get that your husband is grieving and yes he needs consideration and space, but it is absolutely unfair that he has dumped everything on your shoulders here. You are also grieving plus recovering from childbirth. He has got to step up. He cannot just abandon his family (meaning you and your kids) in this way. All of that is bad enough, but to then attack you when you did what needed to be done in telling his family is just an added AH layer.", "NTA. Hell to the fucking **NO** you did not cross a boundary. Everyone grieves differently, but it's been three weeks. Your wishes to tell family are very valid. He brought this on himself. Because of his actions, you had to avoid telling your *own* family what happened. You gave him multiple chances. This is a horrible thing to go through, and I am so sorry for your loss, but he is supposed to be a teammate with you, and in this case, he was playing defense. This was so not fair of him to do this.\n\nAgain, I'm so sorry for your loss, and I'm so sorry that this situation has been harder on you than it should be.", "While there's never a good time to reveal such sad news, the longer this went on, the tougher it was going to be to reveal, especially if people thought the baby was fine.\n\nYou did the right thing - it's not like you did it out of the blue.\n\nI'm torn between NTA and N A H, but I lean ever so more slightly to NTA.\n\nSo sorry to both of you for your loss.", "NTA if he's not talking to you or his family, it seems he's not coping well and should probably see a therapist. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA or N A H.\n\nIt sounds like he's struggling really heavily with grieving, and that's understandable - you both lost your child and are trying to cope with it. But unfortunately, ignoring it meant that the burden of his family's expectations were put on you. Maybe you could have said something to them such as \"I don't wish to discuss my child\", but I'm not sure what your in-laws are like or if they'd try to pry further - I don't think most people would blame you for being direct. \n\nI think counseling is needed here. To help both of you cope - there are therapists who can specialize in loss.\n\nI really hope the best for you too. I'm sorry for the loss you've experienced.", "NTA\n\nI feel sorry for your husband, but what did he expect you to do when the delivery date arrived?\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA to both of you and I'm really sorry for your loss. Your husbands clearly struggling with this as you would be yourself. You both need to talk, you both lost that little baby and are feeling the same pain. It's not fair for you to do all that stuff on your own but really it's not fair this is happening full stop. Everyone deals with things differently and I guess that's how your husband is dealing with it. I hope you can both support eachother and not shut one another out. It may be a good idea for you both to seek therapy for this trauma as it would be alot to go through I'm sure.", "NTA - his grieving process must have been impeding on your own if he was being so unwilling to engage. \n\nI\u2019m imagining being those family members that have been unknowingly hassling you about a baby you lost for weeks\u2026 I\u2019d be so mortified! And, yeah, pretty annoyed at him that he let it happen!", "NTA you had to tell them, it was painfully unfair to you, him, and all of them, for them to not know the truth.  I can\u2019t imagine how difficult every one of those calls and messages was to receive from them before they knew.  You gave him more than enough time to do it, you did what had to be done. Hopefully someday he can understand that.\n\nI am so deeply sorry for your loss, my family went through this last year as well, it\u2019s just the worst.  Wishing you all healing and better days ahead.", "He's grieving, so he left you to field calls from HIS family about your stillborn baby? Like it's somehow easier for you, who had to presumably deliver her? He needs to speak to a grief counselor. You are SO NTA here.", "NTA. Counseling ASAP. You both just lost a child. He is withdrawing and isolating himself. \n\nYou are doing EVERYTHING else and you also lost a child. This is not sustainable. \n\nGrief comes in many colors of emotions and shades of intensity. The only thing you could have done differently is push for therapy to help see why he\u2019s avoiding this so much before telling his family.", "NTA, my thoughts are with you during this difficult time. Counseling is needed asap for the both of you. It had been 3 weeks, you were planning babes funeral\u2026.how much longer did he want to keep this quiet? Your family and friends can\u2019t support you if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.", "NTA. I get that he\u2019s grieving and couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell them, but it was cruel (to them and to you) to let them keep messaging, thinking everything was fine for so long. After a couple of days, he should have accepted your offer to tell them.\n\nI can only imagine how devastating it must have been to receive messages asking about the baby and not being able to say anything. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "**NTA** \\- You did the right thing.  I think that your husband is having a serious psychotic episode and needs help.   If he won't get help on his own, enlist his family.", "I'm so sorry you lost your baby, you must be heartbroken. You two need grief counseling immediately.  Your husband is definitely not handling this well and this is the kind of thing that can split up a couple. The hospital will have resources for you.  Good luck.", "NTA I lost my oldest at 5 months, I understand not wanting to be around family in grief. I went to a hotel that first night to get away. My 2 best friends took turns being with me all throughout the day and night, even though one was due in 2 months(her daughter and my youngest are actually exactly 366 days apart) and the other was dealing with her own shit. But the next day I went back home and started handling the things I needed to even if I was crying the whole time. A day or two of avoidance is okay and understandable, weeks and weeks is not", "I'm not going to say anyone's an AH here because what a difficult situation.   \n\n\nI hope you were given options for help/consultation/whathaveyou when you and your husband came home. If not, then I suggest calling your doctor's office and see if they can refer you/your husband to someone who can listen and help with this loss. If so, please take advantage of those resources.   \n\n\nHope you're doing OK, and I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. He is not the only one in grief. I can\u2019t imagine how exhausting it must feel for you to go through that and then be reminded of the event constantly every day. Your husband is allowed to grieve as well of course but he\u2019s left you to carry all the burden.", "NTA\n\nNot trying to weigh the loss here, but the baby was inside YOU, her death had a physical impact on YOUR body. You shouldn't have to be the one to carry all this weight, he needs to step up. Yes everyone grieves in different ways, but it's totally unfair to make you shoulder so much more of it.", "NAH\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. I'm so sorry that you are having to hold your family together and that you've had to make all the arrangements while your body is still recovering from birth. \n\nI lost my firstborn to stillbirth at 32 weeks. \n\nBoth of you will need to move past who was right or wrong. It doesn\u2019t matter. Because the thing that matters is that your baby died. That is the real problem. And it doesn't have any solution. \n\nHis relationship with his family isn't ruined.

Please be extra-forgiving to yourselves and each other.", "NAH.  I'm so sorry you've gone through this and that your husband's inability to cope with it has led you to this.

I also would advise to consider couple's counseling (not as a comment on your relationship, the stats are just not pretty for couples separating after losing a child).

Talking about anything lessens its power, but you need a huge amount of strength to come to that point. You took that away from him and acted like the only authority. \n\nWe are not all the same.

I have not been down that particular dark path but I buried my mother when I was about a month post partum and I can barely look at photos of that dark, dark time. \n\n Her husband needs to step up yesterday and be there for his wife and allow others like his family to be there for her too. I would do anything for my DIL and  if she needed anything that I could do to make her life remotely easier, I would be happy to do literally anything. If this husband was my son I might just go give him a good taking to. Which is why he\u2019s probably saying she \u201cruined his relationship with his family\u201d they are probably telling him he\u2019s been an ass.", "Yes, and he has also been an AH to his parents, who apparently thought for 3 weeks that they had a healthy grandchild in the world that they were probably itching to go see. He has, in his grief, hurt everyone around him.", "Id have given him until the very first baby text from his family. \n\nHe really took advantage of his wife by depriving her of support from his family, expecting her to conceal her grief from his family, and leaving her to deal with those texts as a reminder.", "I'm sorry for your loss. \n\nIt is good to hear that you and your partner are able to work together and support each other. Best wishes for the future.", "I\u2019m so very sorry for your loss.  Sending you love and light, and good wishes for the future.", "Agreed, he's obviously grieving, but the nasty texts pushed it over the line for me too. There's no excuse for that - and really, while grief is a reason, it's not an excuse to behave like an AH either.", "Sending nasty texts saying she never loved their dead daughter is horrible. It\u2019s fucking evil and cruel.", "\"Oh, my husband's mother and sister and great aunt Judy have all been texting me about the dead baby I just pushed out of my body, but I don't want to be nag.\"", "I'm sorry, but that seems like a horribly judgemental comment. He's locked in a room sending her unhinged hateful texts and she's supposed to magically calm him and tend to his emotional needs? If he's not ready for help, it's not her responsibility to make him accept it, especially when she has her own grief and pain.", ">I don't know if OP lives near her in-laws \n\nI would say they do, since she mentioned that the in-laws kept inviting them over for dinner.\n\nNTA.  They both tragically lost the baby, but it was her body and he's making her carry the whole load.  Either he's incredibly self-centered or needs psychological help.", "[removed]", "I can understand him putting off announcing. I cannot understand and there is no justification for him leaving his recovering wife to handle everything including his LOA from work. That is what makes him the AH. And then texting her nasty messages after all of that.", "I haven\u2019t been through the experience, but I was thinking exactly what you\u2019re saying. I feel so heartbroken for both of them.", "It's the same anxious-avoidant behaviour loop that drives procrastination, or making up excuses not to go to some event, or bottling up your emotions rather than dealing with them, or getting lost in \"what if...\" daydreams, or drives compulsive liars to stick with their lies even when it's becoming obvious that they're lying. At every junction you can just delay a little longer, avoid a little more, make one more lame excuse, stay one step disconnected from reality.\n\nIt looks, from the outside, like someone making one giant arsehole move or character flaw, but the internal reality is instead thousands of tiny little missteps, each of which we'd consider excusable if it happened in isolation.\n\nThis isn't to say the boyfriend is or isn't an arsehole here. I think we can say his aggregate behaviour is arsehole-ish, but we can still have empathy for his situation without removing his responsibility for his actions.", "Yes, OP. Insist to your husband that it is clear he is not dealing with this grief very well, and he has to see a counsellor. You are dealing with your own grief and you need better support than this.\n\nAsk him why telling people about your daughter's passing is evidence of your not caring about her. What you are doing is honouring her and telling people in your family and friend circle about your sad bereavement, so that you can come together in this tragic time.\n\nPretending she doesn't exist and the death never happened does not honour her, her death, or your love for her.", "I totally get that he's going through something I completely don't understand, but every time OP gets a message about the baby wasn't it forcing her to deal with that grief again? She had told him she *needed* for them to know so that they would stop sending her these happy messages, and then after she finally stopped these messages, he attacked her via messages. I don't know what she was expected to do in order to not receive messages that bring up her grief again.", "Thank you. I was starting to wonder if I was alone in thinking the same thing. I just didn\u2019t know quite how to put it into words.", "I am always the one to take care of things in both my family I was born to and my family that I have raised. One of our grandchildren was stillborn and my husband took the reins. For everyone. The parents and for me. It was such a relief. \n\nDespite the OP's husband's grief this does say some things about how he is as a partner and how he will be in the future. He is acting like he is the only one who has feelings or needs time. Childbirth recovery is hard enough with a healthy baby. It was more difficult with my NICU baby and I saw how hard it was with my stillborn grandbaby. It was exponentially harder.", "Yes, OP says he lost as much as she did, which is true, but she went through more than he has. She had to give birth to this baby, and then she has to deal with the physical aftereffects. Then with every single message from his family, she gets to relive the pain and he's forcing her to go through that over and over again.\n\nHe should see somebody about his grief, but he also, as you say, needs to step up for OP. I'm sure he's incredibly sad that they lost the baby, but forcing OP to deal with this loss over and over again when getting messages is just cruel.", "It is so very sad that he deprived them both of the love and support of what sounds like warm, loving family.  The family would have helped carry all the burdens, and taken care of them and their children in their time of grief.", "Could be both.", "partial comment stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113dj4f/comment/j8q535k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "This bot stole this comment from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113dj4f/-/j8q535k).", "Yeah that's where I draw the line too. He is allowed to grieve and take his time to process everything. But the fact is he is neglecting his wife (You know, the actual person whose body the stillbirth happened to) and children is absolutely terrible. And texting his wife horrible messages? Oh god this man needs to stop.\n\nHe needs to get his ass into therapy NTA", "Even just telling one person and asking them to tell the others and ask for privacy. \u201cWe lost the baby. Please let the family know. We are filled with grief and would like privacy so please also let them know that we will reach out when we are ready.\u201d", "And I made it clear that I wasn't justifying it.\n\nBut that grief you feel after that kind of loss is like a white hot knife cutting through your soul. I was mad at like... All mothers. Literally everyone who'd carried a child to term. On some level I realized how insane it was and never acted on it in any way... But if I'd had less life experience and emotional maturity, it's not out of the realm of possibility that I could have turned that anger outwards.\n\nIt's honestly not something anyone can understand without having been there. Been through it. It doesn't make what he's doing OK. It's not. But I get it.", "Yes. This does a great job of fleshing out what I was trying to say.", ">but every time OP gets a message about the baby wasn't it forcing her to deal with that grief again?\n\nYes, which is why it wasn't ok.\n\nUltimately I allowed my mother and father to vague-book about it because I knew that they also needed support, and were also grieving. But like... I've had a rough life (by no fault of theirs). I have a really high level of self awareness because of how much trauma I've been through. I just don't know that I wouldn't have been blinded by grief and rage if I hadn't been in life's ditch multiple times already.\n\nI can have empathy for him while still acknowledging that he's doing the wrong things. This is still very acute. A weeks old injury. He needs to get his shit in order, but... His whole world feels like razor blades and salt. I suppose I think he's THE asshole, but not AN asshole.", "Interesting.. so how is it that his groef doesnt over ride hers but her grief does. Do fathers feel less than mothers? Or is it that fathers emotional needs are less important? The only way your argument works is with tons of misandry", "This is not a male vs female thing. They are BOTH grieving and OP is not only not getting any support from her partner but is forced to be bombarded with constant reminders every day with these family member\u2019s texts. Nobody said anything about OP\u2019s feelings mattering more, the problem here is that OP has been left to carry all the burden.", "No? You\u2019re trying to twist words. I\u2019m saying that she\u2019s putting her own grief on the back burner for him because all he\u2019s thinking about is himself. She\u2019s having to grieve alone and the support system she should have, hasn\u2019t even been notified of anything yet. She doesn\u2019t deserve to hurt to make him feel better.", "His emotional needs are not less important than hers, but she gets to have emotional needs, too. She had to birth a dead baby, plan a funeral, and support her grieving husband while receiving no support from him. She needed him to tell his family so that she wouldn't also have to field inquiries from his family and pretend her baby didn't just die.", "Thank you. It\u2019s like this person is completely overlooking the fact that OP\u2019s husband isn\u2019t supporting her at all."]}
