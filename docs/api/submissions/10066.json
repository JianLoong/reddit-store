After she was delivered the doctor was easily able to find out that there had been an issue with the cord and she simply wasn't getting what she needed to survive, so she died in the womb. It was no ones fault and could not have been helped or prevented, just a terrible accident. \n\nI was 6 months pregnant so everyone knew we were expecting. My husband (29m) has a huge family, and everyone is super close and talk everyday and most of them live together. \n\nI told my family what happened immediately, but my husband asked to tell his family on his own. I said okay, I understand he needs some time with this and I understand he lost as much as I did. \n\nThe problem came up this morning. I reminded him every 2-3 days that he really needed to tell his family. I offered to do it for him more times than I can count. He would occasionally make excuses where he'd say he needed to \"do the dishes\" or \"wash the car\" and didnt have time to call them, so I would do whatever excuse he was using so he had time, just to come back and he still had not done it. I finally told him yesterday that if he would tell them then I would do it this morning, and I followed through. It had been over 3 weeks since she died at this point. In this time I had missed dozens of calls and texts from his family asking how we were/how the baby was/if we wanted to come over for dinner/that they bought us a pack of diapers because Costco had a sale. I had ignored every single member of his family because he kept telling me he would \"get around to it\". I've honestly barely seen my husband over these past few weeks. He goes to either our guest room or office and just sits on his phone. I've left him alone and given him space, but I've also been doing all of the funeral arrangements, paperwork, handling what we need for our work LOA's, handling the insurance and taking care of our house and other kids all on my own.\n\nAnyways, he was absolutely shocked that I actually did it, I'm not sure why. He's been locking in our spare room all morning now texting me all kinds of nasty things that I'm ignoring, and telling me that I ruined his relationship with his family now and accusing me of not loving or caring about our dead daughter.\n\nI understand my husband is grieving, and I feel awful that he's having a hard time, but dodging texts and calls from 20 people for weeks and pretending like everything was fine has been exhausting. It feels like he's trying to ignore that it ever happened and while I'll never forget our daughter we have to move on with our lives.\n\nI think I definitely crossed a boundary, but I also think I was in the right to.

Additionally, you should be recovering from childbirth. Has he been taking care of you at all? \n\nYou did NOT cross a boundary. One, you have the right to share your loss with whomever you choose and two, again, he has not only left all of the burden on you and has not let you grieve or recover, he also left you to play pretend for weeks so he could lock himself in a room or \"do the dishes.\" Honestly you should have done it weeks ago. Your recovering and grieving process has been stalled or interrupted for weeks now.", "NTA\n\nUnless there's something absolutely strange about the way his family reacts to the news of a stillborn, if his relationship with his family is \"ruined,\" he did it himself. By not telling them about your stillborn baby for three entire weeks.", "NTA.\n\nThe family needed to be told.  3+ weeks is enough time to tell them.  Your husband is having a very difficult time and maybe some therapy/counseling would help him with his grief.\n\nThis could not be hidden forever.", "You showed him an immense amount of love to wait as long as you did. I would've given him 2 days. NTA.", "NTA - They are your family too! Husband put you in an extremely awkward situation for weeks, all while you are also grieving.", "NTA .. you\u2019re not only dealing with postpartum hormones, but also with the loss of a child (sending love) \n\nLike you said, you asked and reminded him for weeks. Avoiding family is exhausting! So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong. Wishing you peace and healing mama \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79", "Nta what the heck is up with him that he ignores his wife who had to go through the actual carrying of the stillborn", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nFirst: I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nI cannot imagine the amount of grief you feel. \n\nYou should not have to be carrying on with life alone, managing the household and funeral affairs.\n\n___\n\nSecondly, your husbands family would have learned of your loss one way or another. Like. Im not really sure what his thought process could have been here???? If they werent told, there would be a point they would figure it out given you were no longer pregnant and couldn't show them your newborn.\n\nIf family doesn't know what happened, you cannot lean on them for emotional support in the grieving process. So if you were ready for his family to know, then you were absolutely in the right to tell them.\n\n___\n\nSo again, absolutely NTA. You had every right to tell your husbands family. I hope they are able to provide you with the support you need and deserve right now. Sending much love your way.", "NTA. This was your news to share as much as it was his, regardless of who is biologically related to whom. I mean, if you had no relationship whatsoever with his family, that would be one thing, but you were actively trying to dodge their communications.\n\nPart of me wants to say NAH, because it sounds like he's just responding to grief in a different way... but locking himself in a room and sending you hateful text messages feels clearly out of line.\n\nI would super highly recommend therapy for both of you, or at least a grief support group.", "NTA\n\nHe is grieving and trying to process it, I would wager he doesn\u2019t want to tell people because it makes it real. But eventually you have to let people know, especially since it was probably close to baby shower time and people are shopping for gifts.", "NTA. I'm a big proponent of \"everyone gets to grieve their own way\" but not if it involves requiring your (also grieving) wife to lie and hide and wear a pillow to a baby shower (because that's where this was heading).\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your loss, OP.", "NTA.\n\nYes he is grieving but you are too. Time to get him into counseling. We lost our first child. I miscarried. For the longest time (maybe only 6 months, felt like forever). I felt it was my fault. We were in a book store and I found myself in that section. After 1 or 2 chapters, I was better.\n\nIn your case not the same. Do not know what exactly he is feeling but he needs help. Also ask his family for no pressure until you and then hubby and find a path.\n\nIf you want to chat, IM me.", "I delivered stillborn twins a few months ago, and you are NTA. Your husband is absolutely grieving but so are you. It is not fair that all practical things are falling to you, as well as the emotional heavy lifting of informing people, all while you are physically recovering from birth (you're probably still bleeding pretty heavily, I was at three weeks out) as well as having your hormones go wild on you.\n\nIdeally, he should be taking a lot of this off of your shoulders or, if you are physically up to some of it, doing it TOGETHER. My husband and I held our babies and said goodbye together. We went to the funeral home and made decisions together. We told people sort of together (mostly via text as we'd been keeping our nearest and dearest informed when I went into the hospital). We went to pick up their urns together. In a couple of weeks, on what would have been their due date, we will go scatter their ashes together. We have decided to try again for another baby, and will deal together with the emotional turmoil that that will bring.\n\nTogether. Because we are PARTNERS. We are a team. Because the only thing that lessens pain like this is being able to share it with someone who really understands.\n\nYour husband may be in pain, but you do not deserve this. Sending you great love.", "I am so sorry for your loss, OP. \n\nNTA. Your husband asked to break the news to his family and then promptly refused to do so. He put you in an impossible situation and you did the best you could with it. Yes, he's grieving and grief hits everyone differently, but he should still be there when you need him. Any fallout from his family could've been avoided if he'd just told them like he said he would.", "NTA. Every inquiry you fielded from his family, while knowing that they didn't know, was an intrusion on your grief. That was unfair to you. Yes, people grieve differently, but I'm not sure what he or anyone else expected from you in this situation. Were you supposed to lie, or allow people to keep buying things for the baby?  Wait until the funeral was scheduled maybe? The two of you should be grieving your loss together, but you can't force him to support you, nor can you force him to accept support from you. You're trying to survive this and heal, just like him. He's dealing with the mental and emotional toll. You have that and the physical toll to deal with, including hormonal changes. You haven't had the opportunity to fall apart, because you've been dealing with the hard realities of your situation. Don't beat him up, but don't beat yourself up either. You're doing your best and your best is pretty damn good at this point.", "NTA, I would say NAH but your husband being nasty to you is assholish. \n\nIt is really fucked up that he is acting like he's the only one grieving and pushing all the work onto you. \n\nI understand that he may take reminders every few days as pushing stress onto him, but his family kept contacting you. \n\nBy not telling them it deprives you both of potential emotional support which is very needed in these circumstances. \n\nI don't understand how you telling them ruins his relationship with them. How long did he expect you to suffer alone (he's obviously not providing you support, you're even doing his chores) and in silence? \n\nIt's okay for him to grieve, it's expected that in only three weeks he is not over it. No matter how much you're getting done, you're not \"over it\" either. You're in survival mode, pushing down your grief, because if you don't take care of things (funeral, chores) they won't get done. \n\nAnd if you suddenly stopped doing all house chores and didn't arrange the funeral, what do you think his reaction would be? \n\nHonestly I do feel that he is taking out his grief onto you. You deserve better than to be his emotional dumpster. Especially after you've birthed his children, and your daughter was literally a part of your body for six months. \n\nThis honestly sounds like an Encanto \"Under Pressure\" situation to me. \n\nIt's fair to cut him some slack as he is grieving, but he still needs to take accountability for his actions. You're both grieving, taking it out on each other does not help. Grief carried together is lighter, but grief thrown at others hits both parties twice as hard. \n\nI wish you peace and healing in the coming months and years. Hopefully both you and your husband will be in a better place soon.", "NTH\nIt sounds as though he felt by not telling his family, then she wasn't really gone. Now that they know, it solidifies that she passed. You had to tell them. Hopefully they can help you both during this difficult time. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. NTA. Did you give him a deadline? I can\u2019t imagine your pain and feelings, and it says a lot of good that you\u2019re acknowledging that it\u2019s his loss too (too often, everyone focuses solely on the mother). Have you gotten the help and support you need from family and friends?", "I am very sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA I get that your husband is grieving and yes he needs consideration and space, but it is absolutely unfair that he has dumped everything on your shoulders here. You are also grieving plus recovering from childbirth. He has got to step up. He cannot just abandon his family (meaning you and your kids) in this way. All of that is bad enough, but to then attack you when you did what needed to be done in telling his family is just an added AH layer.", "NTA. Hell to the fucking **NO** you did not cross a boundary. Everyone grieves differently, but it's been three weeks. Your wishes to tell family are very valid. He brought this on himself. Because of his actions, you had to avoid telling your *own* family what happened. You gave him multiple chances. This is a horrible thing to go through, and I am so sorry for your loss, but he is supposed to be a teammate with you, and in this case, he was playing defense. This was so not fair of him to do this.\n\nAgain, I'm so sorry for your loss, and I'm so sorry that this situation has been harder on you than it should be.", "While there's never a good time to reveal such sad news, the longer this went on, the tougher it was going to be to reveal, especially if people thought the baby was fine.\n\nYou did the right thing - it's not like you did it out of the blue.\n\nI'm torn between NTA and N A H, but I lean ever so more slightly to NTA.\n\nSo sorry to both of you for your loss.", "NTA if he's not talking to you or his family, it seems he's not coping well and should probably see a therapist. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA or N A H.\n\nIt sounds like he's struggling really heavily with grieving, and that's understandable - you both lost your child and are trying to cope with it. But unfortunately, ignoring it meant that the burden of his family's expectations were put on you. Maybe you could have said something to them such as \"I don't wish to discuss my child\", but I'm not sure what your in-laws are like or if they'd try to pry further - I don't think most people would blame you for being direct. \n\nI think counseling is needed here. To help both of you cope - there are therapists who can specialize in loss.\n\nI really hope the best for you too. I'm sorry for the loss you've experienced.", "NTA\n\nI feel sorry for your husband, but what did he expect you to do when the delivery date arrived?\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA to both of you and I'm really sorry for your loss. Your husbands clearly struggling with this as you would be yourself. You both need to talk, you both lost that little baby and are feeling the same pain. It's not fair for you to do all that stuff on your own but really it's not fair this is happening full stop. Everyone deals with things differently and I guess that's how your husband is dealing with it. I hope you can both support eachother and not shut one another out. It may be a good idea for you both to seek therapy for this trauma as it would be alot to go through I'm sure.", "NTA - his grieving process must have been impeding on your own if he was being so unwilling to engage. \n\nI\u2019m imagining being those family members that have been unknowingly hassling you about a baby you lost for weeks\u2026 I\u2019d be so mortified! And, yeah, pretty annoyed at him that he let it happen!", "NTA you had to tell them, it was painfully unfair to you, him, and all of them, for them to not know the truth.  I can\u2019t imagine how difficult every one of those calls and messages was to receive from them before they knew.  You gave him more than enough time to do it, you did what had to be done. Hopefully someday he can understand that.\n\nI am so deeply sorry for your loss, my family went through this last year as well, it\u2019s just the worst.  Wishing you all healing and better days ahead.", "He's grieving, so he left you to field calls from HIS family about your stillborn baby? Like it's somehow easier for you, who had to presumably deliver her? He needs to speak to a grief counselor. You are SO NTA here.", "NTA. Counseling ASAP. You both just lost a child. He is withdrawing and isolating himself. \n\nYou are doing EVERYTHING else and you also lost a child. This is not sustainable. \n\nGrief comes in many colors of emotions and shades of intensity. The only thing you could have done differently is push for therapy to help see why he\u2019s avoiding this so much before telling his family.", "NTA, my thoughts are with you during this difficult time. Counseling is needed asap for the both of you. It had been 3 weeks, you were planning babes funeral\u2026.how much longer did he want to keep this quiet? Your family and friends can\u2019t support you if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.", "NTA. I get that he\u2019s grieving and couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell them, but it was cruel (to them and to you) to let them keep messaging, thinking everything was fine for so long. After a couple of days, he should have accepted your offer to tell them.\n\nI can only imagine how devastating it must have been to receive messages asking about the baby and not being able to say anything. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "**NTA** \\- You did the right thing.  I think that your husband is having a serious psychotic episode and needs help.   If he won't get help on his own, enlist his family.", "I'm so sorry you lost your baby, you must be heartbroken. You two need grief counseling immediately.  Your husband is definitely not handling this well and this is the kind of thing that can split up a couple. The hospital will have resources for you.  Good luck.", "NTA I lost my oldest at 5 months, I understand not wanting to be around family in grief. I went to a hotel that first night to get away. My 2 best friends took turns being with me all throughout the day and night, even though one was due in 2 months(her daughter and my youngest are actually exactly 366 days apart) and the other was dealing with her own shit. But the next day I went back home and started handling the things I needed to even if I was crying the whole time. A day or two of avoidance is okay and understandable, weeks and weeks is not", "I'm not going to say anyone's an AH here because what a difficult situation.   \n\n\nI hope you were given options for help/consultation/whathaveyou when you and your husband came home. If not, then I suggest calling your doctor's office and see if they can refer you/your husband to someone who can listen and help with this loss. If so, please take advantage of those resources.   \n\n\nHope you're doing OK, and I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. He is not the only one in grief. I can\u2019t imagine how exhausting it must feel for you to go through that and then be reminded of the event constantly every day. Your husband is allowed to grieve as well of course but he\u2019s left you to carry all the burden.", "NTA\n\nNot trying to weigh the loss here, but the baby was inside YOU, her death had a physical impact on YOUR body. You shouldn't have to be the one to carry all this weight, he needs to step up. Yes everyone grieves in different ways, but it's totally unfair to make you shoulder so much more of it.", "NAH\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. I'm so sorry that you are having to hold your family together and that you've had to make all the arrangements while your body is still recovering from birth. \n\nI lost my firstborn to stillbirth at 32 weeks. \n\nBoth of you will need to move past who was right or wrong. It doesn\u2019t matter. Because the thing that matters is that your baby died. That is the real problem. And it doesn't have any solution. \n\nHis relationship with his family isn't ruined.

Please be extra-forgiving to yourselves and each other.", "NAH.  I'm so sorry you've gone through this and that your husband's inability to cope with it has led you to this.

I also would advise to consider couple's counseling (not as a comment on your relationship, the stats are just not pretty for couples separating after losing a child).

They won\u2019t feel the same sense of loss as you and your husband, but they still will to some extent. Also they need to know to quit buying things for a baby that has unfortunately passed. Your husband had no right to wait so long. It really sounds to me like he is in denial and may possibly need therapy in order to deal with this.", "NAH\n\nYou did nothing wrong, and your are right his family needed to be told. But he is very obviously in deep grief and this was his way of avoiding it. You have forced the issue and have made him face up to what has happened. Expect a lot of abuse. I\u2019m not saying it will be right, but it is what he will most likely do as he goes through this process.", "NTA\nHe had his chance to tell them himself.", "NTA.  Fathers are often treated like their grief doesn't matter in these situations, but this is *bullshit.*  You have been very patient, and he has been incredibly selfish and mean, and has really let you down.  He needs to shape up NOW.  Some things are not acceptable no matter how much pain you are in, and he has pulled at least three of them.  NTA, and I am so sorry about your daughter.", "NTA. \n\nYou lost a baby, and you had a significant medical event happen to you.  I am so sorry for your loss, and for your husband's loss.\n\nHowever, your husband does not have the monopoly on grief.  Nor does he have the right to indefinitely put an additional burden on you in an attempt to not confront his own grief.  He also does not have the right to be hurtful to you because you addressed a reality he refused to.\n\nHe needs counseling. In the meantime, please care for yourself.", "First, I am so sorry for your loss. That would be unimaginably painful. Second, your husband is obviously not coping well with the loss of your child. Third, it had to be done to stop the barrage of checking in texts and calls. That wasn\u2019t good for either of you. That said, NAH. He should have done it but didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t and that meant you had to do it. Please take care of yourself and each other.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019re going through. Your husband seems to be the type that copes by avoiding things but not only is that unhealthy, also super unfair to you. This is something you\u2019re both going through and need to face together, and you\u2019re being very understanding with his grieving but how is he being understanding with yours? Losses like this can make or break a couple so you two need to have a real talk and face the issues head on or this will fester and grow and ruin your marriage.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss OP. \nI think couples therapy is important here if you\u2019re going to salvage your relationship with this guy. \nTake good care of yourself. I am so sorry.\n\nNTA", "First off, I am so sorry for your loss. I'm also sorry that you had to spend weeks acting like your very real tragedy was a dirty secret.\n\nSecondly, tell your in-laws, don't tell them... I don't think that's the real issue. Your husband is grieving, avoiding support, and lashing out at you. I think you need to sit down and confront him because he's a little too eager to blame you for *something* and I think the thing with his family is just an excuse.\n\nHe absolutely has the right to grieve, but he doesn't get to control the entire narrative to support that. You've been very patient so far. Time to find out what's really going on in his head and get him into grief counseling if that's needed.", "NTA, waiting to tell his family was totally unsustainable and only added to your burdens \u2014 lord, knows you don\u2019t need any more burdens right now. You have gone above and beyond as a spouse for someone who is clearly grieving, probably at the expense of your own grief process. OP I am so sorry for your loss and you are honestly amazing for doing all the logistics of loss by yourself and accommodating your husband on top of losing your baby. For real, you\u2019re a super woman and I hope you get the time, space, and support you need \u2014 hang in there.", "First of all, I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine what you must be feeling.\n\nYou are NTA. I get that your husband is grieving too, but he's being an AH to you and that isn't right. He should have told his family right away, he shouldn't be texting you nasty things and he should be helping with the arrangements. He also shouldn't just be leaving you to do all the other stuff too. Even though it was a stillbirth, it was still giving birth. You need to be resting and taking care of yourself. \nLook into grief counseling or support groups and tell him that he needs to go too. If he refuses, maybe you need to take some time to figure out what you want to do.", "First, so so very sorry for your loss. Heartbreaking and I know you are both surely hurting.\n\nNTA\n\nI get that everyone grieves in their own way and respect you trying to allow him to. But the unanswered and continuing communication attempts could only be adding to the grief, and it had to be ended. You tried to hide him time. All anyone could ask of you.\n\nAgain, deepest sympathies for your loss.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, People deal with grief differently. And what you both went through losing this child, has to be one of the hardest things for people to process. The only reason im going with NTA and not a \"NAH\" is because of the way he treated you afterwards. The way he accused you of not loving or caring about your dead daughter is honestly very disgusting behavior from him. \n\nOP- Do not hate your husband for this, Do not let this effect you two. Please seek some sort of therapy for both of you, i feel as though there are things that only therapy can help, and this is one of those things. He certainly is in the wrong, But sometimes people say stuff that hurt those around them due to grief, depression and a multitude of other things.", "[deleted]", ">I reminded him every 2-3 days that he really needed to tell his family. \n\nJesus christ why were you doing that? He's obviously avoidant in grief and you kept pushing him in ways that probably contributed to him retreating even more. This is a mess and you really needed to just talk with each other.\n\nESH", "Yta. Cant be mad that you decided to call everyone becasue he wasnt doing it on your time scale.", "I usually don\u2019t do this but ESH. Husband for shutting himself off for you as you\u2019re both grieving And for not telling his parents in a timely fashion. You for not respecting his wishes. I think (without knowing either of you) that you\u2019re both grieving and struggling with how to handle it all. Best of everything for both of you!", "Yeah I don't know if OP lives near her in-laws but all it would have taken was one unplanned encounter for the truth to come out. OP and her husband should probably see a grief specialist to help them recover and move forward with their grief in a healthy way.", ">He's been locking in our spare room all morning now texting me all kinds of nasty things that I'm ignoring, and telling me that I ruined his relationship with his family now and accusing me of not loving or caring about our dead daughter.\n\nI have no words. Poor woman.", "> Im not really sure what his thought process could have been here???? \n\nDenial is powerful.", "Agreed. Based on the husbands response, my guess is he was flat out lying to his family about the baby, rather than avoiding them like the wife was. So for 3-ish weeks he lied, and suddenly the truth comes out. I hope his relatives are chewing him out for that, and unfortunately, he's now taking it out on the wife. Loosing a child is hard enough without the unnecessary extra drama.", "I am so very for your loss. As a mom too, I can\u2019t imagine how incredibly hard it has been.", "Gosh, I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019ve gone through. I sincerely hope things work out for you guys.", "That probably is what he was thinking, that if he didn\u2019t tell them, his baby was still alive in sone way to his family. It\u2019s a very hard situation all around.", " One, you have the right to share your loss with whomever you choose and two, again,", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "This and so sorry for your loss op. Take care of yourself too. He needs help. Reach out to friends and family.", "This is the answer. I\u2019m sorry you were left alone with your grief OP, it isn\u2019t fair. But he is grieving too. \n\nIt isn\u2019t healthy he wouldn\u2019t deal with her passing, but he needs help and therapy. Maybe his family can reach him now and help him out. It\u2019s too much for you to have to deal with your grief and his alone.", "I\u2019m not sure how many people responding on here understand that OP had to labor and give birth to her daughter. In addition to grieving, she just underwent a medical procedure and came home to a husband who is not only not supporting her but restricting her access to support she could receive - and putting her in a position of having to actively avoid family.\n\nHis way of grieving is actively hurting OP - and while they both lost a child, OP lost a child, is recovering from the birth of that child, and is recovering from pregnancy. Her needs come first and she is incredibly gracious to have taken on so much additional burden while her husband checked out - not being able to support her is one thing, but actively making her grief more difficult is another.\n\nNTA", "Sending her nasty texts isn't great behavior. \n\nBut I think OP and husband should get themselves into some grief counselling.", "I don't think there are any assholes in this scenario, just grieving parents.", "Because that's how often, if not more frequently, his family was texting her about the baby.", "Waiting even two days to tell them is putting a burden on OP, since she has a relationship with them too.", "Did you read the post? She has *tried* to talk to him. It hasn't been a few days, it's been three WEEKS. He wanted to tell his family himself, and that's fine. But she has been forced to lie to her other family members during this time that she's been waiting on him. She is an equal part in this.", "So they\u2019re just supposed to put the funeral on hold until he decides to tell his family?", "This! So much this!! I understand he is grieving, but he didn\u2019t stop being a parent and spouse. Any consequences that resulted from his abdication of his responsibilities are his to deal with, without adding additional stress and responsibility to his wife who also is going through everything he is, and then some!!!", "[deleted]", "Hope you never have a spouse rush your grieving process and then go on reddit to complain.  And i never said that. And also i never said that. But when you go behind your spouse back to communicate things. They start asking you", "Idk, I think OP gave him plenty of respect when his actions were impacting her so deeply. His family was continually reminding her about the baby because he refused to share the unfortunate news.", "His grief doesn\u2019t over ride hers. He is gatekeeping support during a horrible time. She\u2019s had to endure people thinking her child is still ALIVE because he refused to tell his family. She is shouldering everything by herself while he locks himself away and \u201ccleans the car\u201d. Once they married, his family became hers so she has every right in the world to tell her family that she lost her child. He does not get to stop her from that or get mad that she did it for him. If anything, she should be the one going off on him for thinking he could do it in the first place.", "[deleted]", "If the genders were swapped, it WOULD be the opposite vote. \n\nThis woman just BIRTHED A STILLBORN and is healing physically as well as dealing with the emotions. You seem to not understand that she HAS gone through more of a loss than her husband, even if their grief is equal. I had a miscarriage over a year and a half ago and am still getting treated for the physical after-effects, and that's after only a few months of development. This was a full stillborn, which I couldn't even fathom the emotional pain, much less physical pain of losing.\n\nInstead of stepping up and telling his family so that his wife can get some peace, he's forcing his still healing wife to avoid his family, actual gifts, and other things that are hurting her to think of. She gave him plenty of time and a fair warning that if he didn't follow through with what he had said that he would do, she would do it for him because it was impacting her daily life and ability to heal that badly.", "She is supporting him by taking on ALL of their shared responsibilities, all while dealing with everything he is and then some. He needs to step up and deal with parenting his kids, and stop actively making things more stressful and difficult for his wife who is also physically recovering from a stillbirth."]}
