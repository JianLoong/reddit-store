{"id": 10066, "submission_id": "113dj4f", "title": "AITA for telling my husbands family we lost a baby?", "selftext": "Mid-to-late last month I (27f) delivered a stillborn. After she was delivered the doctor was easily able to find out that there had been an issue with the cord and she simply wasn't getting what she needed to survive, so she died in the womb. It was no ones fault and could not have been helped or prevented, just a terrible accident. \n\nI was 6 months pregnant so everyone knew we were expecting. My husband (29m) has a huge family, and everyone is super close and talk everyday and most of them live together. \n\nI told my family what happened immediately, but my husband asked to tell his family on his own. I said okay, I understand he needs some time with this and I understand he lost as much as I did. \n\nThe problem came up this morning. I reminded him every 2-3 days that he really needed to tell his family. I offered to do it for him more times than I can count. He would occasionally make excuses where he'd say he needed to \"do the dishes\" or \"wash the car\" and didnt have time to call them, so I would do whatever excuse he was using so he had time, just to come back and he still had not done it. I finally told him yesterday that if he would tell them then I would do it this morning, and I followed through. It had been over 3 weeks since she died at this point. In this time I had missed dozens of calls and texts from his family asking how we were/how the baby was/if we wanted to come over for dinner/that they bought us a pack of diapers because Costco had a sale. I had ignored every single member of his family because he kept telling me he would \"get around to it\". I've honestly barely seen my husband over these past few weeks. He goes to either our guest room or office and just sits on his phone. I've left him alone and given him space, but I've also been doing all of the funeral arrangements, paperwork, handling what we need for our work LOA's, handling the insurance and taking care of our house and other kids all on my own.\n\nAnyways, he was absolutely shocked that I actually did it, I'm not sure why. He's been locking in our spare room all morning now texting me all kinds of nasty things that I'm ignoring, and telling me that I ruined his relationship with his family now and accusing me of not loving or caring about our dead daughter.\n\nI understand my husband is grieving, and I feel awful that he's having a hard time, but dodging texts and calls from 20 people for weeks and pretending like everything was fine has been exhausting. It feels like he's trying to ignore that it ever happened and while I'll never forget our daughter we have to move on with our lives.\n\nI think I definitely crossed a boundary, but I also think I was in the right to. So, AITA?\n\n\nClich\u00e9 edit to add an update:\nThank you to everyone who's commented because even if you think I'm wrong you've had kind words and I didn't even realize I needed them. I haven't replied to anyone individually but I'm reading every single comment that comes through.\n\nJust to clarify, I never lied to anyone, I just literally ignored them. I got texts and calls every day that I just blocked because I don't even know what I would say if I had talked to them, and I certainly wouldn't have lied about THIS. A lot of you are saying talk to my husband and I agree 100%, I know he's in denial and not able to accept this, so I have to be really careful or else he's going to clam up again and shut me out. I realize now that nagging him to call people was probably a bad move since he's still trying to process. This is all very frustrating because I won't have any answers or solutions until he's ready. I am sorry I told his family because I took away a moment he wanted to have with them, but while I can buy him some time I cannot make the world stop for him.\n\nI have 0 worries about our marriage. Next month will be our 10 yesr wedding anniversary, and we've had a really solid and really excellent and really understanding and resilient marriage up until this point. I have a therapist and have seen her monthly for 5 years. He has refused in the past but I'll bring up therapy for him again when I feel like it's safe to do so.\n\nLastly, I am okay. My body is strong and I feel like I'm handling things appropriately. Don't get me wrong, I was a fucking MESS for a little while. Our other children were staying with my parents and I was going between cleaning parts of my house I've literally never touched or violently sobbing. There was one night I don't even recall, like I blacked out and sat on the floor and cried for honest to God at least 6 hours. It went from night to morning and I didn't even know someone could sit in the dark and cry that long. Getting the kids back and being close with them helped me so much", "created_utc": 1676508281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113dj4f/aita_for_telling_my_husbands_family_we_lost_a_baby/", "score": 3246, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Additionally, you should be recovering from childbirth. Has he been taking care of you at all? \n\nYou did NOT cross a boundary. One, you have the right to share your loss with whomever you choose and two, again, he has not only left all of the burden on you and has not let you grieve or recover, he also left you to play pretend for weeks so he could lock himself in a room or \"do the dishes.\" Honestly you should have done it weeks ago. Your recovering and grieving process has been stalled or interrupted for weeks now.", "NTA\n\nUnless there's something absolutely strange about the way his family reacts to the news of a stillborn, if his relationship with his family is \"ruined,\" he did it himself. By not telling them about your stillborn baby for three entire weeks.", "NTA.\n\nThe family needed to be told.  3+ weeks is enough time to tell them.  Your husband is having a very difficult time and maybe some therapy/counseling would help him with his grief.\n\nThis could not be hidden forever.", "You showed him an immense amount of love to wait as long as you did. I would've given him 2 days. NTA.", "NTA - They are your family too! Husband put you in an extremely awkward situation for weeks, all while you are also grieving.", "NTA .. you\u2019re not only dealing with postpartum hormones, but also with the loss of a child (sending love) \n\nLike you said, you asked and reminded him for weeks. Avoiding family is exhausting! So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong.

Like. Im not really sure what his thought process could have been here???? If they werent told, there would be a point they would figure it out given you were no longer pregnant and couldn't show them your newborn.\n\nIf family doesn't know what happened, you cannot lean on them for emotional support in the grieving process. So if you were ready for his family to know, then you were absolutely in the right to tell them.\n\n___\n\nSo again, absolutely NTA. You had every right to tell your husbands family. I hope they are able to provide you with the support you need and deserve right now. Sending much love your way.", "NTA. This was your news to share as much as it was his, regardless of who is biologically related to whom. I mean, if you had no relationship whatsoever with his family, that would be one thing, but you were actively trying to dodge their communications.\n\nPart of me wants to say NAH, because it sounds like he's just responding to grief in a different way... but locking himself in a room and sending you hateful text messages feels clearly out of line.\n\nI would super highly recommend therapy for both of you, or at least a grief support group.", "NTA\n\nHe is grieving and trying to process it, I would wager he doesn\u2019t want to tell people because it makes it real. But eventually you have to let people know, especially since it was probably close to baby shower time and people are shopping for gifts.", "NTA. I'm a big proponent of \"everyone gets to grieve their own way\" but not if it involves requiring your (also grieving) wife to lie and hide and wear a pillow to a baby shower (because that's where this was heading).\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your loss, OP.", "NTA.\n\nYes he is grieving but you are too. Time to get him into counseling. We lost our first child. I miscarried. For the longest time (maybe only 6 months, felt like forever). I felt it was my fault. We were in a book store and I found myself in that section. After 1 or 2 chapters, I was better.\n\nIn your case not the same. Do not know what exactly he is feeling but he needs help. Also ask his family for no pressure until you and then hubby and find a path.\n\nIf you want to chat, IM me.", "I delivered stillborn twins a few months ago, and you are NTA. Your husband is absolutely grieving but so are you. It is not fair that all practical things are falling to you, as well as the emotional heavy lifting of informing people, all while you are physically recovering from birth (you're probably still bleeding pretty heavily, I was at three weeks out) as well as having your hormones go wild on you.\n\nIdeally, he should be taking a lot of this off of your shoulders or, if you are physically up to some of it, doing it TOGETHER. My husband and I held our babies and said goodbye together. We went to the funeral home and made decisions together. We told people sort of together (mostly via text as we'd been keeping our nearest and dearest informed when I went into the hospital). We went to pick up their urns together. In a couple of weeks, on what would have been their due date, we will go scatter their ashes together. We have decided to try again for another baby, and will deal together with the emotional turmoil that that will bring.\n\nTogether. Because we are PARTNERS. We are a team. Because the only thing that lessens pain like this is being able to share it with someone who really understands.\n\nYour husband may be in pain, but you do not deserve this. Sending you great love.", "I am so sorry for your loss, OP. \n\nNTA. Your husband asked to break the news to his family and then promptly refused to do so. He put you in an impossible situation and you did the best you could with it. Yes, he's grieving and grief hits everyone differently, but he should still be there when you need him. Any fallout from his family could've been avoided if he'd just told them like he said he would.", "NTA. Every inquiry you fielded from his family, while knowing that they didn't know, was an intrusion on your grief. That was unfair to you. Yes, people grieve differently, but I'm not sure what he or anyone else expected from you in this situation. Were you supposed to lie, or allow people to keep buying things for the baby?  Wait until the funeral was scheduled maybe? The two of you should be grieving your loss together, but you can't force him to support you, nor can you force him to accept support from you. You're trying to survive this and heal, just like him. He's dealing with the mental and emotional toll. You have that and the physical toll to deal with, including hormonal changes. You haven't had the opportunity to fall apart, because you've been dealing with the hard realities of your situation. Don't beat him up, but don't beat yourself up either. You're doing your best and your best is pretty damn good at this point.", "NTA, I would say NAH but your husband being nasty to you is assholish. \n\nIt is really fucked up that he is acting like he's the only one grieving and pushing all the work onto you. \n\nI understand that he may take reminders every few days as pushing stress onto him, but his family kept contacting you. \n\nBy not telling them it deprives you both of potential emotional support which is very needed in these circumstances. \n\nI don't understand how you telling them ruins his relationship with them. How long did he expect you to suffer alone (he's obviously not providing you support, you're even doing his chores) and in silence? \n\nIt's okay for him to grieve, it's expected that in only three weeks he is not over it. No matter how much you're getting done, you're not \"over it\" either. You're in survival mode, pushing down your grief, because if you don't take care of things (funeral, chores) they won't get done. \n\nAnd if you suddenly stopped doing all house chores and didn't arrange the funeral, what do you think his reaction would be? \n\nHonestly I do feel that he is taking out his grief onto you. You deserve better than to be his emotional dumpster. Especially after you've birthed his children, and your daughter was literally a part of your body for six months. \n\nThis honestly sounds like an Encanto \"Under Pressure\" situation to me. \n\nIt's fair to cut him some slack as he is grieving, but he still needs to take accountability for his actions. You're both grieving, taking it out on each other does not help. Grief carried together is lighter, but grief thrown at others hits both parties twice as hard. \n\nI wish you peace and healing in the coming months and years. Hopefully both you and your husband will be in a better place soon.", "NTH\nIt sounds as though he felt by not telling his family, then she wasn't really gone. Now that they know, it solidifies that she passed. You had to tell them. Hopefully they can help you both during this difficult time. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. NTA. Did you give him a deadline? I can\u2019t imagine your pain and feelings, and it says a lot of good that you\u2019re acknowledging that it\u2019s his loss too (too often, everyone focuses solely on the mother). Have you gotten the help and support you need from family and friends?", "I am very sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA I get that your husband is grieving and yes he needs consideration and space, but it is absolutely unfair that he has dumped everything on your shoulders here. You are also grieving plus recovering from childbirth. He has got to step up. He cannot just abandon his family (meaning you and your kids) in this way. All of that is bad enough, but to then attack you when you did what needed to be done in telling his family is just an added AH layer.", "NTA. Hell to the fucking **NO** you did not cross a boundary. Everyone grieves differently, but it's been three weeks. Your wishes to tell family are very valid. He brought this on himself. Because of his actions, you had to avoid telling your *own* family what happened. You gave him multiple chances. This is a horrible thing to go through, and I am so sorry for your loss, but he is supposed to be a teammate with you, and in this case, he was playing defense. This was so not fair of him to do this.\n\nAgain, I'm so sorry for your loss, and I'm so sorry that this situation has been harder on you than it should be.", "While there's never a good time to reveal such sad news, the longer this went on, the tougher it was going to be to reveal, especially if people thought the baby was fine.\n\nYou did the right thing - it's not like you did it out of the blue.\n\nI'm torn between NTA and N A H, but I lean ever so more slightly to NTA.\n\nSo sorry to both of you for your loss.", "NTA if he's not talking to you or his family, it seems he's not coping well and should probably see a therapist. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA or N A H.\n\nIt sounds like he's struggling really heavily with grieving, and that's understandable - you both lost your child and are trying to cope with it. But unfortunately, ignoring it meant that the burden of his family's expectations were put on you. Maybe you could have said something to them such as \"I don't wish to discuss my child\", but I'm not sure what your in-laws are like or if they'd try to pry further - I don't think most people would blame you for being direct. \n\nI think counseling is needed here. To help both of you cope - there are therapists who can specialize in loss.\n\nI really hope the best for you too. I'm sorry for the loss you've experienced.", "NTA\n\nI feel sorry for your husband, but what did he expect you to do when the delivery date arrived?\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA to both of you and I'm really sorry for your loss. Your husbands clearly struggling with this as you would be yourself. You both need to talk, you both lost that little baby and are feeling the same pain. It's not fair for you to do all that stuff on your own but really it's not fair this is happening full stop. Everyone deals with things differently and I guess that's how your husband is dealing with it. I hope you can both support eachother and not shut one another out. It may be a good idea for you both to seek therapy for this trauma as it would be alot to go through I'm sure.", "NTA - his grieving process must have been impeding on your own if he was being so unwilling to engage. \n\nI\u2019m imagining being those family members that have been unknowingly hassling you about a baby you lost for weeks\u2026 I\u2019d be so mortified! And, yeah, pretty annoyed at him that he let it happen!", "NTA you had to tell them, it was painfully unfair to you, him, and all of them, for them to not know the truth.  I can\u2019t imagine how difficult every one of those calls and messages was to receive from them before they knew.  You gave him more than enough time to do it, you did what had to be done. Hopefully someday he can understand that.\n\nI am so deeply sorry for your loss, my family went through this last year as well, it\u2019s just the worst.  Wishing you all healing and better days ahead.", "He's grieving, so he left you to field calls from HIS family about your stillborn baby? Like it's somehow easier for you, who had to presumably deliver her? He needs to speak to a grief counselor. You are SO NTA here.", "NTA. Counseling ASAP. You both just lost a child. He is withdrawing and isolating himself. \n\nYou are doing EVERYTHING else and you also lost a child. This is not sustainable. \n\nGrief comes in many colors of emotions and shades of intensity. The only thing you could have done differently is push for therapy to help see why he\u2019s avoiding this so much before telling his family.", "NTA, my thoughts are with you during this difficult time. Counseling is needed asap for the both of you. It had been 3 weeks, you were planning babes funeral\u2026.how much longer did he want to keep this quiet? Your family and friends can\u2019t support you if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.", "NTA. I get that he\u2019s grieving and couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell them, but it was cruel (to them and to you) to let them keep messaging, thinking everything was fine for so long. After a couple of days, he should have accepted your offer to tell them.\n\nI can only imagine how devastating it must have been to receive messages asking about the baby and not being able to say anything. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "**NTA** \\- You did the right thing.  I think that your husband is having a serious psychotic episode and needs help.   If he won't get help on his own, enlist his family.", "I'm so sorry you lost your baby, you must be heartbroken. You two need grief counseling immediately.  Your husband is definitely not handling this well and this is the kind of thing that can split up a couple. The hospital will have resources for you.  Good luck.", "NTA I lost my oldest at 5 months, I understand not wanting to be around family in grief. I went to a hotel that first night to get away. My 2 best friends took turns being with me all throughout the day and night, even though one was due in 2 months(her daughter and my youngest are actually exactly 366 days apart) and the other was dealing with her own shit. But the next day I went back home and started handling the things I needed to even if I was crying the whole time. A day or two of avoidance is okay and understandable, weeks and weeks is not", "I'm not going to say anyone's an AH here because what a difficult situation.   \n\n\nI hope you were given options for help/consultation/whathaveyou when you and your husband came home.

It doesn\u2019t matter. Because the thing that matters is that your baby died. That is the real problem. And it doesn't have any solution. \n\nHis relationship with his family isn't ruined.

You both are grieving differently, but both are valid. If you both aren't already seeking individual therapy for this, I would strongly recommend it. I also would advise to consider couple's counseling (not as a comment on your relationship, the stats are just not pretty for couples separating after losing a child).

I can really truly imagine my marriage dynamic here and I have a very very good husband.\n\nThere are good moms out there who lost a child, and then lost the rest of their children in their pit of despair. \n\nThis guy is most likely in a deep and very dark hole, and she\u2019s in a tunnel powering through because that\u2019s just what moms fucking do, and because if I\u2019m being truly honest that\u2019s just what women are *used* to doing in these type situations. Because the world just doesn\u2019t carry us the same. Women through out history have often had to be the strong silent backbones of the foundation. I\u2019m not going to get into to that though, because it\u2019s not the time nor the place. (And I\u2019m not trying to demean men or place a stereotype there or here either, so don\u2019t go there with me here please)\n\nI made a comment that is probably sitting somewhere deep at the bottom because I came late, but I think if his family knew how bad it was they might be able to split forces. Right now they just learned of the loss, but I don\u2019t think they know how bad it is. But I\u2019m hopeful by the sound of this post that they would be willing and able to help if they knew. Hopefully half the forces dragging him out of the drenches to get him help he needs so he can see reality and thus the mess of things he is making and the other half to help support her mentally and physically with all this.", "Yes!

She has zero emotional support or physical support from him while doing everything and not taking care of herself like she needs to. It takes 6-8 weeks to recover from childbirth. She is three weeks in and doing house chores.\n\nYes, the expectation is that someone take care of the person who just went through a medical event and is devastated.

Second time she basically busted in and said we're supposed to be in this together I won't do it alone and he realized he never truly learned to cope with death and her finally making him talk to her made him sorta realize what he was doing. Then he was able to go to therapy and see how much he was putting on her but he didn't know....I just don't think people not knowing how to cope makes them the AH(especially how a good deal of men have been conditioned to be tough, not to show emotions, so now they don't understand how to deal with those intense feelings and nothing or anger is the goto).

Obviously, they will be asking for updates, buying presents, etc.  A worse scenario would be that his family found out from your family and they might then think that you had kept this from them on purpose.  If he didn't feel up to telling his family, he should have asked yo to do it.\n\nNTA", "Nta...I understand your husband is grieving, I lost my first child to sids, it's hard. But his family NEEDED to be tikd and he wasn't doing it. Ignoring it won't make it not true. It is not fair to you or his family for him to not tell them for 3 whole weeks. It's not fair for you to have to either ignore or lie to his entire family for weeks till he decided to tell them. And what if he hadn't told them by the time the funeral came around? Was he just going to call them the day before and say oh btw our baby died a month ago the funerals tomorrow y'all coming? Your husband needs to accept what has happened,possibly see a grief counsellor. I'm sorry for your loss, and good luck to you.", "NTA, it sounds like he's having a mental breakdown, if he hasn't told his family, he definitely hasn't been getting support from them either (because they don't know, not because they don't care)", "NTA - This is an awful situation.

This is simply devastating and everyone handles grief differently.\n\nThe family needed to know, maybe it should have been your husband but in absence of him feeling capable of doing it you did it. 3 weeks is probably about right really. You can\u2019t ignore it forever and things do start to get awkward with people buying things for baby and talking to you excitedly about updates etc.  The funeral is to be arranged which those same family members would want to attend, and this can\u2019t drag on forever. \n\nYour husband sounds angry and maybe it\u2019s not really at you for that, it\u2019s the situation and maybe himself a bit.\n\nCommunicate with him. You guys will get through it. It is done now. Time to move forward with everyone on the same page.\n\nI wish you the very best of luck.", "NAH.  You've both been through a terrible tragedy.

Yes, he should have done more for her also, although he was actually doing chores and not hiding.

How did they make it 3 weeks? He must have been in touch with them, no?", "Husband is an asshole. If he was just avoiding the topic, i can understand that.

I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t mean that the relationship with his family is ruined. What kind of relationship is it if it is?

You're both grieving and no one really did anything wrong, it's likely he didn't want to tell them at first because he was in denial and having to break the news to his family would make it more real.  The best thing would have probably been to both talk and figure out a way to tell them together, but waiting a month certainly didn't help.  I'd recommend grief counseling more than anything else, I'm sorry for your loss OP", "NTA\n\nYour husband let you down. You didn't do anything wrong. Yes, he lost something, but you went through the physical/hormonal side of it and that is brutal. It is not fair that not only didn't he handle his family for you, he didn't handle anything. Loss and pain dont mean he gets to just abandon you when you're dealing with such a massive loss. \n\nHe cannot text you abuse because he didn't do what he said he'd do. He's no one to blame but himself.\n\nI suggest a counselor for you both, including a marriage counselor.

Take care of yourself.", "I think this is probably NAH, because I want to give your husband so much leeway for the terrible situation you're both in. You are definitely more right than he is, OP, but I can understand both his desire to tell his side of the family himself and his inability to bring himself to do it. It sounds like you waited until you really needed them to know in order not to damage your own relationships with them, and it just sucks that things got to that point before he was ready to make the calls himself.

I woke up one morning fine. The next morning I wanted to die. It was the hardest thing I have ever been through. I've been abused by men. I was raped by a guy at 18, and then a year later another one did the same. The PTSD was a nightmare, but losing my son... When it hit me, that was something special. \n\nI do hope you are coping as well as it seems. Be ready to seek support just in case please. Your life has meaning and purpose. \nYour husband needs help. He's angry, and that's normal for grieving. My loss ended my marriage. It took five years to face that and get divorced. He didn't want to grieve, and I was stuck in depression. By the time I realized we needed help we just didn't have the bond to salvage. There's no a-hole. Everybody suffers differently. Be forgiving and let him come to terms with his anger. He's probably feeling very helpless right now. Men want to fix everything. He can't. That's really devastating. So he hides away from the pain of helplessness, and from your pain, and his grief by isolating and avoiding. He needed them to know what happened. He may not see it right now, but you made the right choice. \n\nThere's a website nowilaymedowntosleep.org \nThey have support resources and help for parents after loss. \n\nMollybears.org is another. \n\nThe founders of both are amazing people.

You both are going to need to lean on each other over the next little while as you both heal, that does mean that sometimes on person does do more at times, but it shouldn't be the one person doing it all. \n\nYou also need time to grieve, and to literally heal since you went through the birthing process. He needs to be giving you that time too. I am not trying to downplay his feelings, because it is okay for him to have them, but he sounds like he is just shutting down and you need to have him supporting you just like you are supporting him.", "Do I think the husband is in denial and needs to work through this?

He is clearly suffering and needs as much or more help than she does. To be honest his path seems more destructive, to himself, to his relationship with his wife and kids, and to his family. He\u2019s still accountable for his actions. Ideally, he would be able to step up and help, but I think we forget that emotional wounds are as devastating as physical ones.  I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s in a place where he can recognize the damage he\u2019s doing, and I wouldn\u2019t blame him, I\u2019d blame the grief. We\u2019re better off looking at the problem rather than targeting the people.", "Please shut up. Thank you", "YES. She had to deliver a dead baby OUT OF HER BODY. And she\u2019s doing it with no support.", "That\u2019s completely not true. This sub favors men. Hence all the comments saying YTA or NAH when her husband clearly sucks.", "ha! try again; top comments are in OP\u2019s favor and anyone even trying to have a balanced opinion is relegated to \u201cControversial\u201d for daring to consider the husband at all. i usually roll my eyes at commenters crying \u201cmisandry!\u201d on every thread, but calling out the unfairness this time is clearly justified. \n\ni don\u2019t think OP is in the wrong, at all, but the husband\u2019s behavior from a pregnant woman would be hand-waved away because \u201chormones\u201d, and trying to claim otherwise just further highlights the lack of awareness people have about that unfair response in this sub \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
