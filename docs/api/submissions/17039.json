Luca is my sister Gwen's son. Gwen's relationship with Luca's dad ended when he was just a baby and his dad died soon after. Gwen was in a relationship after he died for two years but that ended when she wanted her partner to marry her and adopt Luca before he'd remember life without him. I remember my sister being distressed about Luca not having a dad and my parents and my other sister told her repeatedly that he needed a good mom who focuses on giving them a good life and she was enough. She didn't take it on board for at least another year and then she suddenly declared she was going to be single until he was an adult. That lasted all of a year when she met her husband Rich. Rich had his own two kids who were 12 and 10 at the time. Luca was 5 when they met. Gwen and Rich were dating for a year before they married and it was one of those dynamics where everyone could see it was not what they were presenting to the world but they didn't care. Rich's kids did not like that he remarried and they took an extra special dislike toward Luca because he was forced onto them.\n\nIt created a very painful dynamic for Luca. My family would step in and ask if Gwen was sure it was good for Luca. That Rich's kids didn't seem too fond of Luca or that Luca seemed to be left out by the older kids. She would say they are slowly warming up or that Rich was handling it.\n\nLuca and I really bonded around this time. He would come to me and I would let him vent and give him a place to share his frustrations and fears. He mentioned countless times that Gwen or Rich would get his stepsiblings to bring him with them and they would walk away and leave him behind places like at the mall or the park. I would help him tell Gwen and she would blow it off as nothing to worry about since Luca was fine. I told Gwen that Luca was really struggling to find his place when she was telling him one thing and the kids were telling him another. She told me he would listen to her since she's his mom.\n\nLast year Luca came to live with me after he asked and I had spoken to some people who could help. It wasn't easy but he's happier now. Through the legal fight for me to get custody, he was diagnosed with depression and it was revealed his experiences in the home contributed to it. It had also harmed his self esteem to an alarming degree, according to a court appointed therapist. A few days ago Gwen and I ended up in the same place and she told me I interfered in something that was not her business. I told her that Luca deserved a better mom than her and she needed to not talk to me when I was the one there for her son and not her. She burst into tears and left.

Yes, both. Your other sister telling you that you should have walked away obviously doesn\u2019t care enough about Luca to stand up for him like you have.

It takes a Lot for most courts to be willing to grant someone else custody and you probably had quite a legal fight.  THe court appointed therapist recognized how unsafe Luca's previous home environment was for his mental health.  \nHonestly unless the court has ordered you to give her information about Luca I'd put her on an information diet and tell her she can't vent to you.

There are some people who tell the truth and can still be AHs but you aren\u2019t one of them. You told your sister the facts, and the facts are that she failed as a mother.

If she is still in denial about the harm she did to her child then it needed to be said.", "NTA, sir. \n\nThe fact that he was diagnosed with depression because of his living situation before he came to you and the court had to appoint a therapist for him, should sum everything nicely for your sister to understand. She knew she failed but that was a hard pill to swallow because not only is it clear to the family how she failed but also to people outside.

She can't handle hearing it because she knows you're right.  You're other sister doesn't want to see the truth for what it is.  Imagine how terrible a home must be for a court to award custody to someone other than the child's mother? You don't describe a situation that Luca was living with people with addiction or in an environment that was so dirty it was uninhabitable, yet you still won custody.  That says something.

I'm sure you have a man, or more, in your family/friends circle that would have been good male role model for Luca and even if not, there are many great people out there who are single parents, managing to fill both roles by themselves without much help (kudos to every single one of them!). So it was never about a dad for Luca. She wanted a husband (fine) and sacrificed her son to get her imaginary perfect life.\n\nShe made her choice. Willingly.

If you run into her, walk the other way. If she comes after you, give her a repeat of your last interaction, give her the verbal smackdown 2.0: electric bogaloo if she insists. Don't get loud or aggressive with her, just calmly state the facts. If she doesn't want to hear them, she, again, has a choice and can just leave you tf alone.", "NTA.

Your sister sounds like she has required a hard dose of reality for a long time.   She tried to force this Brady bunch fantasy life on Luca when it was clear the separate families didn't blend.  \n\nThe age gap alone between the kids would have been sign one that things wouldn't mesh as it is hard enough to get blood siblings at that age to get along.  And only dating Step-dad for a year before marrying him? That might be fine if it is two single people, with no kids; but trying to blend a family takes time (if it is possible at all).", "NTA.

Just more of her suffering for Luca's sake, and she knows that didn't work.\n\nAll around, I think everyone failed here and should just leave each other alone.

She probably thinks she is doing what's best for him when all she wants is a fantasy.", "Totally agree. The same goes for the relationships between kids and step-parents, what parents (and step-parents) must understand is that the kids have no obligation to people who are strangers to them, they didn't choose to have them in their lives, they didn't choose to form a family with them, therefore they have every right not to want to have anything to do with them and not to consider them as part of their own family (provided that there must be mutual respect for the person and the roles within the family dynamics)", "She can't blame anyone else but herself, your nephew is lucky to have you", "No, just ignore her emails.

Luca needs a safe place where he can heal from his emotional trauma, that's where you come in. Eventually, he will need to come to terms with his relationship with his mother, and decide for himself if she was a bad mom or not.\nMeanwhile, your sister needs to work on her own issues and what she's done to her son.
