Rich had his own two kids who were 12 and 10 at the time. Luca was 5 when they met. Gwen and Rich were dating for a year before they married and it was one of those dynamics where everyone could see it was not what they were presenting to the world but they didn't care. Rich's kids did not like that he remarried and they took an extra special dislike toward Luca because he was forced onto them.\n\nIt created a very painful dynamic for Luca.

That doesn\u2019t happen easily. It had to have been epically bad neglect and unsafe for your nephew. Thank God he had you!", "It's not east at all for him.

Yes, both. Your other sister telling you that you should have walked away obviously doesn\u2019t care enough about Luca to stand up for him like you have. It feels like she was perfectly fine with him being treated like this. \n\nAs for Luca\u2019s reluctant mom\u2014I never understood women like her. Truly, I don\u2019t. But then again, I would never put a man before my heathens. \n\nYour sister knows she failed Luca, but instead of admitting what she did and realizing what she has done to her own son and trying to fix her damage, she\u2019s pissy at you for daring to get involved. \n\nBut I\u2019m so glad you did.

Write a whole letter in how she broke her sons heart and why she is an asshole. She needs to see the truth.", "NTA\n\nI don't blame Gwen for being upset at what you said, as it crossed the line from attacking behavior to attacking character or the person's core being, but what did she expect to hear from you? Like, hello, you filed custody papers against her. And I'm not convinced the she didn't have ulterior motives in approaching you. She could have used anything you said in sympathy against your case in court. A bit of overwhelming bluntness may have been your only real resort.", "NTA, Gwen is a monster", "NTA.  It takes a Lot for most courts to be willing to grant someone else custody and you probably had quite a legal fight.  THe court appointed therapist recognized how unsafe Luca's previous home environment was for his mental health.  \nHonestly unless the court has ordered you to give her information about Luca I'd put her on an information diet and tell her she can't vent to you.

Gwen is an ahole and you other sister an enabler. Kudos to you for saving Luca.", "NTA in the slightest.

The courts, therapists, multiple official people, Luca himself, are telling her what OP did.

I imagine it would be scary too, to do it alone.\n\nI\u2019m glad you are able to help him out. I also think you told your sister nothing but the truth. There are some people who tell the truth and can still be AHs but you aren\u2019t one of them. You told your sister the facts, and the facts are that she failed as a mother.

If she is still in denial about the harm she did to her child then it needed to be said.", "NTA, sir. \n\nThe fact that he was diagnosed with depression because of his living situation before he came to you and the court had to appoint a therapist for him, should sum everything nicely for your sister to understand. She knew she failed but that was a hard pill to swallow because not only is it clear to the family how she failed but also to people outside.

She sounds like a terrible mother and I'm so glad Luca has you.  NTA.", "NTA. You did an amazing thing by taking Luca. He finally has a warm, stable, loving environment and is not being treated like an afterthought or a burden to everyone in his home.  You said the truth to your sister.  She can't handle hearing it because she knows you're right.  You're other sister doesn't want to see the truth for what it is.  Imagine how terrible a home must be for a court to award custody to someone other than the child's mother? You don't describe a situation that Luca was living with people with addiction or in an environment that was so dirty it was uninhabitable, yet you still won custody.  That says something.  Even if what you said was too harsh, it still doesn't make you an AH. It makes you the only adult looking out for Luca.

The truth hurts?\n\nThis is one of those things that probably could have gone without saying, especially now that the kiddo is in a better place and being taken care of.  But, you didn't reach out with this nugget - she pressed you and started this conversation.  So, I'm going to go with NTA.  The kid is 16 and has suffered potentially irreparable damage as a result of her pulling the wool over her own eyes, in spite of multiple attempts by you to be honest.
