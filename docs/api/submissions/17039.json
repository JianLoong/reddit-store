{"id": 17039, "submission_id": "13fhgni", "title": "AITA for telling my sister my nephew deserved a better mother than her?", "selftext": "I (34m) have a 16 year old nephew Luca. Luca is my sister Gwen's son. Gwen's relationship with Luca's dad ended when he was just a baby and his dad died soon after. Gwen was in a relationship after he died for two years but that ended when she wanted her partner to marry her and adopt Luca before he'd remember life without him. I remember my sister being distressed about Luca not having a dad and my parents and my other sister told her repeatedly that he needed a good mom who focuses on giving them a good life and she was enough. She didn't take it on board for at least another year and then she suddenly declared she was going to be single until he was an adult. That lasted all of a year when she met her husband Rich. Rich had his own two kids who were 12 and 10 at the time. Luca was 5 when they met. Gwen and Rich were dating for a year before they married and it was one of those dynamics where everyone could see it was not what they were presenting to the world but they didn't care. Rich's kids did not like that he remarried and they took an extra special dislike toward Luca because he was forced onto them.\n\nIt created a very painful dynamic for Luca. My family would step in and ask if Gwen was sure it was good for Luca. That Rich's kids didn't seem too fond of Luca or that Luca seemed to be left out by the older kids. She would say they are slowly warming up or that Rich was handling it.\n\nLuca and I really bonded around this time. He would come to me and I would let him vent and give him a place to share his frustrations and fears. He mentioned countless times that Gwen or Rich would get his stepsiblings to bring him with them and they would walk away and leave him behind places like at the mall or the park. I would help him tell Gwen and she would blow it off as nothing to worry about since Luca was fine. I told Gwen that Luca was really struggling to find his place when she was telling him one thing and the kids were telling him another. She told me he would listen to her since she's his mom.\n\nLast year Luca came to live with me after he asked and I had spoken to some people who could help. It wasn't easy but he's happier now. Through the legal fight for me to get custody, he was diagnosed with depression and it was revealed his experiences in the home contributed to it. It had also harmed his self esteem to an alarming degree, according to a court appointed therapist. A few days ago Gwen and I ended up in the same place and she told me I interfered in something that was not her business. I told her that Luca deserved a better mom than her and she needed to not talk to me when I was the one there for her son and not her. She burst into tears and left. She told our parents and other sister. Our parents said I was right but our other sister told me I should have walked away without saying that to her. Gwen even emailed me a whole letter saying why I was an asshole and how I had broken her heart.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683888204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fhgni/aita_for_telling_my_sister_my_nephew_deserved_a/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The truth hurts. She failed as a mother, she was too focused on her selfish desire to create the \"perfect family\" to ignore her son's feelings, prioritize her own happiness over her son's, minimize the situation and force him into years of abuse from her husband's kids.

She only seen what she wanted to, and that she had a \u201ccomplete\u201d family, a dad for Luca even though it doesn\u2019t sound like the best environment at all.

That doesn\u2019t happen easily. It had to have been epically bad neglect and unsafe for your nephew. Thank God he had you!", "It's not east at all for him. Luca was brushed aside almost daily and told that he should not stop considering stepsiblings siblings by my sister, when she was told by him and by me, what was happening. Never mind the fact he was slowly losing all his self worth and my sister was just so preoccupied to notice and then even said to the lawyer and to the therapist that \"it doesn't make sense for him to be depressed over his siblings growing up\" like that's what it was. Or the fact she expressed annoyance to the therapist that he didn't have siblings when she has told him almost daily since he was 5 that he has.", "NTA. But both of your sisters are.\n\nBoth? Yes, both. Your other sister telling you that you should have walked away obviously doesn\u2019t care enough about Luca to stand up for him like you have. It feels like she was perfectly fine with him being treated like this. \n\nAs for Luca\u2019s reluctant mom\u2014I never understood women like her. Truly, I don\u2019t. But then again, I would never put a man before my heathens. \n\nYour sister knows she failed Luca, but instead of admitting what she did and realizing what she has done to her own son and trying to fix her damage, she\u2019s pissy at you for daring to get involved. \n\nBut I\u2019m so glad you did. The foundation and safety you have given Luca cannot be congratulated enough. He needed you and you were there for him.\n\n\ud83d\udda4", "The truth hurts sometimes. NTA!", "What a horrible mom, stepdad and step siblings. \n\nNTA\n\nGood that you have him now. Keep on fighting for him", "NTA You did what Gwen didn't do very well. You took care and are still caring for Luca. What's important is to continue to do what is best for Luca. Gwen broke her own heart. As a mother she should have put Luca's needs before her own and she didn't. She's the AH.", "NTA you said what needed to be said to her. Your nephew did deserve a better mother and she failed him. Instead of taking responsibility for her actions she wants to blame you I for loosing her son. \n\nYou will never get through to your sister. This will always be your fault in her eyes, however in your nephews eyes you will always be the one that stepped up when he needed you. \n\nI would not let your sister attack you for her failure. If she does then give her the real truth back to her.", "NTA. Gwen is the kind of woman who puts c\\*ck before kids.", "NTA: You saying something mean to her broke her heart more than her son choosing to live with someone else. This says everything about your sister.\n\nLuca is lucky to have you in his life. Too bad Gwen didn't realize he had a great father figure his whole life.", "Nta. Write a whole letter in how she broke her sons heart and why she is an asshole. She needs to see the truth.", "NTA\n\nI don't blame Gwen for being upset at what you said, as it crossed the line from attacking behavior to attacking character or the person's core being, but what did she expect to hear from you? Like, hello, you filed custody papers against her. And I'm not convinced the she didn't have ulterior motives in approaching you. She could have used anything you said in sympathy against your case in court. A bit of overwhelming bluntness may have been your only real resort.", "NTA, Gwen is a monster", "NTA.  It takes a Lot for most courts to be willing to grant someone else custody and you probably had quite a legal fight.  THe court appointed therapist recognized how unsafe Luca's previous home environment was for his mental health.  \nHonestly unless the court has ordered you to give her information about Luca I'd put her on an information diet and tell her she can't vent to you.  She failed her son and continues to refuse to admit that failure", "NTA \n\nAnd thank you for stepping up for Luca.", "NTA AND  YOU ARE A \u2728", "NTA \n\nSo your sister is still making it all about her instead of giving a damn about Luca. Your right he deserved a better mother, thankfully he has you now.", "NTA if anything you were far to kind to her, and for far too long.", "NTA \n\nBlock your sisters. Gwen is an ahole and you other sister an enabler. Kudos to you for saving Luca.", "NTA in the slightest. She is more concerned about a facade of a family front then her epic failure of being a loving and engaged parent of her biological son. Luca needs stability. You are giving him that. Anyone who disagrees can kick rocks.", "NTA... if you broke her heart by telling the truth, imagine how luca must feel having to live that truth.\n\nYou're probably nicer than me, but I would have been like \"it's not really about your heart, and that's what you never understood, it was supposed to be about luca and what's good for him\".", "NTA and at some point you\u2019re going to see a lot more real proof that you were completely on the right!", "This 1000%", "Yeah, OP didn't swoop in and kidnap a child, he won a custody case against. I didn't notice mention of a partner, so a single man won custody against the biological mother who has a partner. That's not an easy feat, even with a 15-16 year old.", "Right? The courts, therapists, multiple official people, Luca himself, are telling her what OP did. Did she not get the message that she was emotionally neglecting her son? \n\nEven now, her thoughts are not about Luca and self realization, they're about \"How dare OP embarrass me publicly by gaining custody *and* reiterating what they said, what an asshole!\" Poor kid. I'm glad he has OP in his life.", "Better yet email her the link to this sub post. \n \nNTA.", "Thank you for looking out for Luca. It can\u2019t be easy when your family won\u2019t support you and you have to wait to grow up and legally be able to move out of the house. I imagine it would be scary too, to do it alone.\n\nI\u2019m glad you are able to help him out. I also think you told your sister nothing but the truth. There are some people who tell the truth and can still be AHs but you aren\u2019t one of them. You told your sister the facts, and the facts are that she failed as a mother. So much to the point where a court would rather give her own child to someone else than have the child stay with her\u2026 and that\u2019s simply sad.\n\nLuca is the only thing that matters now, not your sister\u2019s feelings.", "Imagine how bad things must have been if op was able to succeed at gaining custody.
