Luca is my sister Gwen's son. Gwen's relationship with Luca's dad ended when he was just a baby and his dad died soon after. Gwen was in a relationship after he died for two years but that ended when she wanted her partner to marry her and adopt Luca before he'd remember life without him. I remember my sister being distressed about Luca not having a dad and my parents and my other sister told her repeatedly that he needed a good mom who focuses on giving them a good life and she was enough. She didn't take it on board for at least another year and then she suddenly declared she was going to be single until he was an adult. That lasted all of a year when she met her husband Rich. Rich had his own two kids who were 12 and 10 at the time. Luca was 5 when they met. Gwen and Rich were dating for a year before they married and it was one of those dynamics where everyone could see it was not what they were presenting to the world but they didn't care. Rich's kids did not like that he remarried and they took an extra special dislike toward Luca because he was forced onto them.\n\nIt created a very painful dynamic for Luca. My family would step in and ask if Gwen was sure it was good for Luca. That Rich's kids didn't seem too fond of Luca or that Luca seemed to be left out by the older kids. She would say they are slowly warming up or that Rich was handling it.\n\nLuca and I really bonded around this time. He would come to me and I would let him vent and give him a place to share his frustrations and fears. He mentioned countless times that Gwen or Rich would get his stepsiblings to bring him with them and they would walk away and leave him behind places like at the mall or the park. I would help him tell Gwen and she would blow it off as nothing to worry about since Luca was fine. I told Gwen that Luca was really struggling to find his place when she was telling him one thing and the kids were telling him another. She told me he would listen to her since she's his mom.\n\nLast year Luca came to live with me after he asked and I had spoken to some people who could help. It wasn't easy but he's happier now. Through the legal fight for me to get custody, he was diagnosed with depression and it was revealed his experiences in the home contributed to it. It had also harmed his self esteem to an alarming degree, according to a court appointed therapist. A few days ago Gwen and I ended up in the same place and she told me I interfered in something that was not her business. I told her that Luca deserved a better mom than her and she needed to not talk to me when I was the one there for her son and not her. She burst into tears and left. She told our parents and other sister. Our parents said I was right but our other sister told me I should have walked away without saying that to her. Gwen even emailed me a whole letter saying why I was an asshole and how I had broken her heart.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683888204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fhgni/aita_for_telling_my_sister_my_nephew_deserved_a/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The truth hurts. She failed as a mother, she was too focused on her selfish desire to create the \"perfect family\" to ignore her son's feelings, prioritize her own happiness over her son's, minimize the situation and force him into years of abuse from her husband's kids. She can't blame anyone else but herself, your nephew is lucky to have you taking care of him and you are a safe haven for him where he can express all his emotions and have support.", "NTA\n\nI hope you responded to the email with \"well now you know what your son has felt for the last 11 years with such a shitty mother\"... but I'm petty", ">Gwen even emailed me a whole letter saying why I was an asshole and how I had broken her heart.\n\nEmail her back saying why she is an AH and how she has and still is breaking her son's heart.  \n\nNTA.

Luca himself and you tried to address this over the years and she complained ignored it. Ignored it so badly that it got to the point that her young son was depressed and harming himself! She only seen what she wanted to, and that she had a \u201ccomplete\u201d family, a dad for Luca even though it doesn\u2019t sound like the best environment at all. She brushed off his needs and his concerns for what she wanted and yes, Luca deserved and still does deserve a better mom.

That doesn\u2019t happen easily. It had to have been epically bad neglect and unsafe for your nephew. Thank God he had you!", "It's not east at all for him. Luca was brushed aside almost daily and told that he should not stop considering stepsiblings siblings by my sister, when she was told by him and by me, what was happening. Never mind the fact he was slowly losing all his self worth and my sister was just so preoccupied to notice and then even said to the lawyer and to the therapist that \"it doesn't make sense for him to be depressed over his siblings growing up\" like that's what it was. Or the fact she expressed annoyance to the therapist that he didn't have siblings when she has told him almost daily since he was 5 that he has."]}
