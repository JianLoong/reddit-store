{"id": 28317, "submission_id": "170wnyx", "title": "AITA for telling my younger son he needs to learn how to cook and go in public if he wants to move out?", "selftext": "I (F59) have two sons, 30 and 21. The younger one  is in the autistic spectrum. He is high functioning, but there are a few circumstances he has a hard time dealing with, and one of those is going alone in public, the other one is cooking, He cannot cook and he refuses to learn because he is afraid of using the stove.\n\nLately  he has been toying with the idea of moving out and living as an independent adult. (For context, per my country\u2019s law, my husband and I are his legal guardians, despite being 21, because he is disabled). Now I think he can handle most of the independent adult life, he has a remote job that pays well, and he is pretty good at keeping his space clean. But it worries me that he doesn't cook and he can\u2019t go out in public alone. \n\nSo, my husband and I told him he could move out with two conditions: he needed to learn how to cook, and he needed to learn how to go alone in public. That was a couple of weeks ago, we stopped cooking his meals and told him he needed to go alone everywhere he wanted to go. It\u2019s not going well, he hasn't even tried, he simply doordash everything or eats stuff that doesn\u2019t require cooking on the stove, and avoids going out in public, he has been locked in his room since. \n\nNow, my older son came for a visit this weekend. Apparently my younger son wanted to go to the zoo, but he knew his dad and I wouldn\u2019t take him, so he called his brother. I told my older son not to take his brother to the zoo, if he wanted to be an independent adult he should be able to handle going to the zoo by himself.\n\nMy older son said we were  being absurd, that his brother was not going to magically learn to go out  in public alone, and then he took his brother to the zoo. When he dropped his brother back, we got into an argument over this. He said that by stopping taking him to places and cooking for him, I\u2019m punishing his brother for suggesting he wanted to move out. I told him this is not a punishment, any independent adult needs to know how to cook and how to go out in public alone. He says he agrees but that we need to take baby steps here to help his brother be able to do these  things, instead of just stopping doing it for him out of sudden. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable here and my husband agrees, but my older son is acting as if we are assholes.

If they drown, they drown?!\n\nAlso, did you toilet train your children or did you just stop providing them with diapers and they magically started using the toilet themselves?\n\nIf someone doesn't know how to do something, you need to slowly integrate it and/or teach them until they know how to do it.\n\nYTA to both you and your husband. At least your youngest son has his older brother on his side - he's the sensible one compared to his parents.", "YTA \n\nHe can't just do stuff he doesn't know how to do. None of us can. As his guardians, its your responsibility to teach him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSet aside a few nights a week to teach him how to cook basic meals and show him the stove isn't scary. Or teach him some cold meal recipes that will still give him the nutrition he needs. \n\nTake him out and let him do something alone but stay in the parking lot or something. So he knows you're there if he needs you but he gets the exposure of like going into a store alone or something.\n\nOR just let him do his thing.

He\u2019s clearly not getting more independent living with you so I\u2019m not sure what you think you\u2019re accomplishing by holding him there. \n\nSeriously. Do it now before he decides living at home is cushy and safe and changes his mind. \n\nYTA because you\u2019re actually stifling his pushes towards independence.", "INFO: How much have you tried to gradually teach him how to do these things on his own? Presumably he has been out in public with you many times; did you take any opportunities recently to find small chances for him to develop independence and learn how to navigate it?\n\nHow about with the cooking? Is your solution really to hope he suddenly gets over his fear, or have you explored non-stove options that might help him, like microwave, air fryer, or hotplate recipes?", "YTA  -  You are correct that he should learn to cook and go places alone if he wants to live independently but your approach is wrong. \n\nWhen you want to teach someone a new skill you always start small and build up.  If you wanted him to learn to swim you wouldn't throw him in the deep end of the pool and just expect him to not drown with zero help and this is in many ways the same.  \n\nStart small,  think about how you give younger kids more autonomy as they age.  When theyre younger you go everywhere with them, as they get older maybe if they need the public restroom they can go alone, then maybe go to the store alone and so on.  \n\nSame with cooking,  maybe start by helping woth the precooking tasks,  chopping stuff or something before moving on to adding it to a hot pan, stirring while it cooks. \n\nThese things all take time, but qt least you are showing your son that you trust him and are working towards his goals together.", "YTA.\n\nYou can't just expect him to know how to do things. You have to *teach* him how to do things. Teach him how to navigate the public transit system. How to ride a bike. How to use GPS or a map. How to find his way home if he gets lost.\n\nAnd there damned few foods you NEED a stove to cook!\n\nTuna, pickles, mayonnaise, and onions on bread make a nice sandwich. Hell, sandwiches in general. There are a TON of foods you can make with a microwave. TEACH him how to cook without using a stove, it's not that hard. It shouldn't take that long.", "YTA on the going out in public. Forcing him to do it only makes it more stressful, and that's not learning in any productive sense. I think your older son has the right idea. Acclimate him to crowded places, and then lengthen the leash more and more. \n\nFor cooking what is it that scares him about the stove? I only ask because if it's the open flame or a fear he'll burn the house down, maybe getting him an induction burner would help. The heat from it is \"invisible\" because it heats the pan magnetically.", "Autistic chiming in: what you are doing isn\u2019t helping your son. What it is is abuse.

Is it noise and solved with earplugs? Is it crowds and going off hours helps? \nThere are thousands of highly autistic people like me out there and we function perfectly fine. Hell moving out might actually give him the space to figure out his needs\nI agree with the older brother \nYTA", "Your older son is right. It is unreasonable to think that automatically your younger son would know how to do these things. Contact an independent living program and see if they can help. You aren't wrong in that he should know these things, but your implementation was terrible.

What about a microwave and air fryer?\n\nYTA", "YTA- \n\nHe can feed himself without cooking. I love to cook, but I have friends who have gone years without cooking for themselves. They have not starved. \n\nI am deathly afraid of driving, therefore I cannot go to places alone. I require help with rides. I have moved to two different cites, gotten two degrees, and have a good job and good friends, all without having yo be able yo go to places alone. \n\nIs it ideal? No. Have I made it work? Yes. Has it required a lot of support from my friends and family? Yes. \n\nBeing an adult isn't being an island of complete independence. You can ask for help. You can help others and be helped in return. It's allowed to be a group activity.", "I don't think AITA is the right question.  You're not wrong that he needs to learn to do those things, but the way you're trying to get him to do them is obviously not working, so you need to think of something else.", "I think there\u2019s some missing information here. I think it\u2019s hard to rip off the Band-Aid completely all at once. Have has there been consistent efforts to slowly remove yourselves from cooking and outdoor tasks? Like walk into the grocery store and you stay at the door while he goes and fetches three items then stand behind him while he checks out? Then just sit in the car while he does his shopping, etc. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve already done this to start the process, if you have not, then you can\u2019t go from 0 to 60 overnight. Again with cooking it needs to be side-by-side involving both parties in the cooking task and you slowly remove yourself. If the stove is not going to be an option, then you find other methods, there\u2019s many different appliances and other things you can use to cook healthy meals like a pressure cooker or toaster, oven, etc. So like I said, there seems to be some missing information : if you\u2019ve taken care of him entirely, and then change everything overnight then YTA.", "Soft YTA. While your overall conditions for him moving out are reasonable, it\u2019s irrational to just stop giving him support and expecting that he\u2019ll \u201cmagically\u201d develop those skills. \n\nYou need to set SMART goals- Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound\n\nSpecific- make a list of the places your son needs to go to on his own in order to meet his needs (grocery shopping, purchasing toiletries, etc) and specific foods he needs to prepare to meet his nutritional needs\n\nMeasurable- define what comprises a \u201csuccessful\u201d  outing and meal prep- selecting and paying for XYZ toiletries and groceries without a meltdown (or at least managing meltdown symptoms until getting home where he can recuperate). Decide how many such outings and meal preps you will guide him through, give him a framework/structure (checklist, reviewing coping strategies for any problems that may arise, etc), and then define how many outings of that nature he\u2019ll need to handle independently to meet your expectations. \n\nAchievable- as previously mentioned, provide guidance, and structure the first few times he practices these outings and meal preparations, and then set him up for success by making sure he has his supports in place for when he goes out or cooks on his own. Maybe reach out to the manager of the nearest grocery store and convenience store and ask if you can take your son there and help him get acclimated to the layout during their least busy hours, and revisit again during busier hours if that\u2019s when he\u2019ll be needing to shop. Determine if he\u2019ll need noise canceling headphones, a lanyard he can show someone to ask for assistance, patience, more time, etc (like the invisible disability sunflower lanyard and card https://hdsunflower.com/), whether he\u2019ll need something to organize cash bills/coins to avoid confusion, or if he\u2019ll be using a card to pay (if so, is there a spending limit? Tim him through a scenario of how to return a few items if he hits a spending limit on a card or runs out of cash). Set him up with a waterproof customized booklet of instructions on how to prepare his basic meals, complete with reminders for using microwave, stove, oven, etc. in all reality he should be able to prepare a variety of meals without using a stove or oven\n\nRelevant - only require him to perform tasks that he needs to function, not any extraneous tasks\n\nTime bound - give him a deadline by which a certain number of outings and mark preps must be accomplished, or set some other type of time limitation on meeting parts of certain tasks", "YTA. You're being ableist. Not everyone cooks. Not everyone has to do everything that others do. He's an adult. Let him make his own decisions. What country even has you still being in legal control of him at 21?", "YTA for the way you tried to teach him- \u201chere, cook a meal or starve!\u201d\n\nWhy not teach him a few simple recipes that require minimal stove prep?   Acclimate him to it. Or things like a one-pot meal?  Honestly, if he cooks a big batch he really only needs to cook 1-2 times a week.", "From what you are posting, small YTA. He probably needs therapy to help with these things, including you as parents learning how to support him to get him to certain goals. I would have thought that you would have been connected to these types of resources already.", "YTA\n\nYour idea that he needs to learn these things is not wrong, but your older son is right! Just cutting him off completely is not helping at all, you need to set a plan for helping him manage these difficulties.", "YTA \nAlso by the way, you could start by teaching to cook without stove. I've been doing ok (not as usual) without an oven or a stove for two weeks now as kitchen is being renovated. \nWell I have a microwave, a boiler, a soup maker. And someone lent me a slow cooker. I'm eating! Cooked food. \nThere is your way and the right way, but it will not be the same for everyone. If you have any of these items at home, you need to start teaching your son recipes. And how to. \nThe going out alone, I don't have a suggestion. Emotional support rat?", "YTA In a way I agree with you. If you live alone or even an adult you should be able to cook for yourself and go out in public but I think you are going about it wrong and therefore losing your moral high ground. \n\nThe way is not to refuse to feed him. Now that might work, if he was refusing out of pure idleness but you accept he's frightened and possibly just doesn't know how. \n\nIt's probably better to \"force\" him to cook something while you watch to try and wean him off this fear. \n\nThere's also a difference between being able to function outside alone and doing everything alone. \n\nI live alone, go places alone and I'm not neurodivergent as far as I know and I still wouldn't go to the zoo alone. I would be able to but why would I. At least half the fun is going with a companion. Also there are crowds with children, who might look at a lone person strangely. \n\nStart with the things that he would actually have to do and start small. Eg. Darn, I've forgotten to buy a lemon, can you go to the corner shop and get one for me. etc.", "YTA \n\nI raised my autistic niece and nephew. I had goals for them but your being ridiculous. It does seem like your trying to sabotage him.\n\nMy niece fears the stove so we've stuck to ready to eat and microwave because it is in her comfort zone. And if he can afford door dash then he's not going to starve.\n\nGlad he had his older brother looking out for him", "While limiting, he doesn't actually have to learn to cook on a stove. Microwave, kettle, things like sandwiches and delivery services are viable options. \n\nThe going out alone thing needs to be done in stages.

Make sure he has his phone and you are easy to contact, and not far away, then make the drop offs longer and in different, less comfortable places.", "YTA. Help him become independent! He obviously doesn\u2019t want to be like this. You can start small on these things. Take him to cooking classes.

You sound both like a lazy parent and like an AH.", "Have you guys taught him to cook? Or just told him too do it?\n\nMy father showed me to do oatmeal when I was around 9, then I did it myself while he supervised a few times.\nThen I could do it myself.\n\nHelp him build confidence with cooking simple things he like.", "YTA\n\nGeez, drop the kid in the deep end why don\u2019t you? As the parents of a special needs child with Autism, adhd and severe learning difficulties, I am disgusted by your post. DISGUSTED.\n\nHow is your child meant to learn and gain confidence if you just dump him to learn on his own? What about taking him to classes to teach him to cook that deal with the neurodivergent? Or finding him a support worker that will come to your house and teach him, also take out into social access and learn how to adjust?\n\nYou say he has his own money, so a few hours a week of proper guided help shouldn\u2019t cost him (or you) too much, and this is something that could help him even after (if) he moves out.\n\nYour older son is right. You can\u2019t just expect this change to happen all at once, and you\u2019ve taken away his safety net of his PARENTS who are meant to protect him. How is he going to be able to trust you ever again? You\u2019ve let this happen, just to control him.\n\nI hope your older son takes him away from you and they both dump your arses.", "YTA. \n\nYour older son is right. Teaching him to cook should have been done years ago, a little bit at a time and you should be helping him now. Going out in public alone is fine for things like the grocery store but who wants to go to the zoo or a show without company? Have you taken some steps to help him meet some friends? Or anything?", "You clearly never attempted to teach him any of these things, and your solution is just to tell him to go do it?\n\nYTA. Massively", "YTA I visited a friend who lived in a dorm without a kitchen. Sandwiches, tacos, rotisserie chicken. In this day and age cooking is not necessary. And you look like someone who will keep moving goalposts till he has to be a gourmet chef to move out. As for going out in public, so his brother or friend will come with him. Not your problem.", "YTA first of all, who wants to go to the zoo alone? Secondly, your older son is absolutely right. You just threw these conditions on him and told him to figure it out. But he has autism and needs help trying to work through these things. It seems like you don't want him to move out so you're just throwing him to the wolves until he gives up and stays living with you. That is not good parenting. I would even go so far as to say that these are things you should have been working on with him long before he even became an adult.", "YTA.\n\nYou're not incorrect that those are important skills for living independently, but the thing about skills is that they need to be *taught*. You're not going to get anywhere by simply demanding that he possess them. *Work with* your son, figure out the best way he can learn; don't just punish him for not being normal.", "How come you\u2019ve never worked on teaching him these skill sets in the first place, regardless of if he would ever live independently or not?\n\nInstead of helping him, you just said figure it out and are won\u2019t even support him or teach him anything. \n\nYTA. This is gross.", "While I understand your sentiments YTA here.\n\nThink back to when he was learning to walk,talk, potty train, read and get dressed in the morning. These are things that have to be done slowly right it\u2019s not an immediate magic in one day. \n\nYou have to start small with things like microwaving veggies during meals. Using the toaster to make breads. Making a sandwhich or salad. Low stake things that don\u2019t involve the stove. Once used to that then you can do boiling water for pasta one night. Alongside you so he learns how to do it.", "Sorry, I must have missed the part where you talked about the therapies and services you're using for him to learn to work with these severe anxieties?\n\nYTA", "Autistic responder. YTA.\n\nThis is one of the worst ways to go about trying to get him those skills. Help him look for cooking classes or recipes! Talk about what types of cooking he would be more comfortable with! Things not on the stove, or how to address his fears about the stove. What worries him about public spaces? Is there an ideal place to start there? One less crowded, less far from home, less noisy, are there accessibility tools that could help him like headphones? \n\nOf course he \"hasn't tried\", trying to do everything he's afraid of at once and \"cold turkey\" from the help he's used to is extremely overwhelming. It comes across with the effects of a punishment, regardless of how you intended it. Just please, talk to your son about what he needs and what would be most effective in helping him reach his goal. \n\nI have always had a fear of driving, much like your son is afraid of cooking. It takes more time than a neurotypical person, and much more gradual steps, but I'm getting my license at 23 this month. It can happen for him. He just needs support!", "YTA. There are plenty of ways to survive living alone without knowing how to cook. You can get microwave meals, use an air fryer, a slow cooker etc. But people need to be helped to learn these processes.\n\nMy hubby lived alone and didn't know how to cook until we moved in together and I have taught him a little. \n\nAlso, being able to go out alone isn't something that can magically happen with the click of your fingers. Social anxiety isn't fun, there's no insta-cure, it takes time and nurturing.", "You're gonna have to teach him the basics of cooking and how to be an adult. YTA for making him go cold turkey. Older brother is not in the wrong here.", "YTA. Yes, those are important skills, but he\u2019s not going to suddenly be able to do those things without your help. Instead of making him figure it out on his own, help him ease into it.", "YTA - there are programs available to help adults with special needs. Just because your son cannot cook, does not mean he is incapable of feeding himself. You've already said that he uses doordash and makes other types of food that does not require cooking. As for going out in public alone - many people who are not on the autism spectrum have difficulty going out in public alone, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with him requesting help. Your older son is correct - you ARE punishing your son for wanting to move out. I really hope that he realizes that even though legally you are his guardians because of his \"disability\", he can actually have someone else assigned as his legal guardian it doesn't have to be you & your husband, you are just the most convenient at the moment.", "YTA - your older son is 100% correct. Talk to a therapist and make a goals sheet for your youngest son. The therapist can help give you a care plan to teach him what he needs to learn and experience things safely. Then it takes pressure off you little by little and helps your son reach his goals and eventually move out. DON'T HINDER HIS SUCCESS DUE TO YOUR FRUSTRATION!", "NTA. People need either motivation or pressure to learn challenging things. If he has no motivation and there is no pressure, when would he ever learn? \n\nIt sounds like there may be things you could do to have him take baby steps. For example, maybe he could have met his brother at the zoo. Brother takes care of paying and other details, but he had to get there on his own. Maybe the next time, they meet inside the zoo, etc. \n\nBut, yes, you either have to commit to someone doing things for him the rest of his life or at some point pulling back. Probably not a third option available.", "Find some middle ground. If the stove scares him, would he use an electric griddle? What about a waffle iron? Is it the stove top, the oven, or both? Can he learn a few microwave things too, like instant rice and frozen veggies? What about an instant pot or rice cooker?\n\nCan you help him with a list of healthy meal options that don't require cooking, like healthy sandwiches and wraps?\n\nAs for going out alone, why? Why can't he have a friend go with him to run errands? Would you still be willing to help him with appointments?\n\nYTA\n\nYour son needs support not ultimatums.", "YTA and your older son is correct.  I'm also deferring to him because he's in the situation and therefore knows more than you could tell us in a Reddit post. \n\nYour son isn't cooking, and yet is surviving.  So what if he door dashes as long as he can afford it.  He can also use a microwave, toaster, air fryer, crock pot etc instead of the actual oven.  And that would all be okay too.\n\nAs for not going out in public why is that a requirement to move out?   He'll figure out what he needs to. \n\nYou are purposefully putting up road blocks.

Let him GO.", "Assuming this is rage bait, but just in case it isn\u2019t, you are a stupid asshole.  \n\nI\u2019m perfectly capable of cooking, and I door dash the fuck out of food.

You and your husband are being downright cruel. Unbelievable. You both are definitely TA. Just wow!", "As someone on the spectrum, YTA. First of all, what you consider as being an \"independent adult\" is stupid. So he wants to only go out with friends/family? Me too. I pretty much don't leave the house except for work unless someone is with me. I have a mortgage and a husband. I pay bills. As for cooking, you could teach him how to make things that don't require a stove. Sometimes you have to accept that what you consider \"normal\" isn't a one size fits all. You son will never fit into the mold of perfect adult, and you need to stop acting like he has to. Sounds to me like he has all the skills he needs to live on his own. He can make money, get food, and keep his space clean.", "YTA. Your son is autistic and therefore needs help to try and manage these concerns not just stopping everything and denying him help. He is probably even more panicked and triggered. You think tough love will help but you\u2019re failing to consider his neurodiversity and how what you\u2019re doing is going to impact him and potentially regression.", "YTA. Hi, neurodivergent adult here. The way you\u2019re going about this is cruel and rooted in ableism. First of all as a person in my 20\u2019s I know plenty of neurotypical young adults who cannot cook to save their lives. Or who don\u2019t like to cook. Or who don\u2019t have time to cook. Instead they consume foods that are already made, are easy to make, or they get take out. As someone who loves to cook I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s a bit silly at times, but they survive and are happy and frankly what you or I think about that way of living doesn\u2019t really matter because we are not them. \n\nSecond, surely you\u2019re aware that sometimes autistic folks do things differently. That doesn\u2019t mean we cannot do them, it just means we need some accommodations. If your son is afraid of the stove there are lots of other kitchen appliances he can learn to use. Lots of people prefer to use microwaves, air fryers, convection ovens, toaster ovens\u2026the list goes on. Fuck you can do just about anything with a crockpot! Instead of choosing to just *quit feeding him* why not work together to find things he can cook with and then spend some time trying new recipes together? Assuming you don\u2019t totally hate him it could be a nice bonding activity, time you might miss when he moves out. \n\nThird yeah no one wants to go to the zoo *alone*. How many people have you ever seen at the zoo by themselves? I do these kinds of activities by myself a lot as my partner lives in another state and I\u2019ve moved around so much that I don\u2019t always have a local friend group. It\u2019s dramatically less fun than going with someone else. It sounds like your older son is brilliant with his brother and you should be grateful that they get on so well. \n\nLiving independently is hard but your son can likely do it. This reads like you want him to fail to prove some sort of point or to ensure he\u2019s always reliant on you, which is a horrible thing to do to an autistic person. You and your husband won\u2019t be around for forever and God willing, your son will outlive you. Helping him towards a more independent life is not only good for his self esteem but is ultimately a good plan for his future.", "YTA I get your reasoning and that he needs to learn independence but this should have been something you had gently encouraging before it got to this point. Not suddenly throwing him in the deepend and watching him sink. How did you think he was suddenly going to go to the zoo alone after all this time? You should have taken him and encouraged him to walk off alone to see things for a few minutes at a time and build it up from there.", "I agree with your older son. Why can\u2019t you get him basic cooking lessons and cook with him and then slowly have him do it one day by himself.\n\nAs far as going out alone that\u2019s a lot and can push him into a panic attack. Talk with a professional on how to help with this.", "I bought microwave cookware with instructions for my daughter who is on the spectrum. She can make full balanced meals in the microwave. She\u2019s also comfortable with our toaster oven. Using these has also helped her to gain confidence with using the stove for simple things. The thing is, this requires work on my part to find tools she could feel confident using independently then doing it with her so she could learn.\n\nFor getting around, we took the bus together to get places until she learned how the bus system works and we went through the trip planning app so she could gain independence. \n\nAre you seeing a pattern here? She has to have her hand held guiding her through learning these skills before she could do them herself.\n\nSince your son uses DoorDash, he could easily use Uber to get around on his own. Have you shown that to him? Have you had him handle his own shopping while you accompany him in case he has questions or anxiety about something? Independent skills need to be taught.", "YTA.\n\nFirst, it sounds like he is doing just fine on the cooking front. He's making things that don't require the stove. He's ordering door dash. He's *feeding himself,* which is the point of cooking!! Do you know how many non-disabled men don't know how to use a stove and get by just fine??\n\nSecond, on going out. Do you know how many non-disabled people don't actually do anything alone?! It's practically a meme, for God's sake. You're not even restricting this to reasonable limits, like \"get milk from the corner store\"--who in their right mind goes to the *zoo* alone?! And he clearly isn't incapable of finding the company that would allow him to go out--in your own story, you described him deciding he wanted to leave the house and making plans with someone to do so. Do you know how many people, disabled and non-disabled alike, don't actually have that skill??\n\nThe things you have described are ableist and controlling. If your son didn't have a diagnosis --if he were the exact same person without the official paperwork--he would be able to have a truly independent life, and maybe, like millions of other people out there, it would involve a lot of cold meals and group outings and quiet days where he doesn't get out much. You don't get to decide that this life isn't worth living because his autism gives you power over him. You didn't describe someone who isn't capable; you described a young man who is a resourceful and creative problem solver in the face of unrealistic and cruel expectations. It's such a shame you think so poorly of your own child's abilities that you aren't willing to let him be a full person.", "YTA for suddenly making those changes for him. You\u2019re supposed to teach him how to gradually adapt out there on his own.", "I\u2019m not gonna make a judgement but I would advise that there are numerous things he can cook without a stove/oven.  The burners of course can turn out things but so can the microwave and an instant pot can be a God send.  I love my slow cooker crockpot but the Instantpot can turn out rice and bake things and stuff and it\u2019s push button easy.  The worst is waiting for it to depressurize.  There is also a new Suvie robot which is expensive but will let him cook a small personal portion by programming it with a cell phone and then do handy things like turn itself off. Or wait for him to get his meal.  The Suvie company also does deliveries of preportioned and packaged meals that are load/scan/go. \n\nAs far as public visits, there will be times he can skirt it by appointing a proxy or POA but he will need to do like doctor visits and stuff.  Maybe some mental help or a gentle anti anxiety med would be helpful but that\u2019s a big hurdle.   \n\nHe does need some kind of succession plan when his guardians can no longer take care of him.  I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s a group home or nursing care or what but it\u2019s best to figure out the plan as soon as possible and plan accordingly.

The younger one  is in the autistic spectrum. He is high functioning, but there are a few circumstances he has a hard time dealing with, and one of those is going alone in public, the other one is cooking, He cannot cook and he refuses to learn because he is afraid of using the stove.\n\nLately  he has been toying with the idea of moving out and living as an independent adult. (For context, per my country\u2019s law, my husband and I are his legal guardians, despite being 21, because he is disabled). Now I think he can handle most of the independent adult life, he has a remote job that pays well, and he is pretty good at keeping his space clean. But it worries me that he doesn't cook and he can\u2019t go out in public alone. \n\nSo, my husband and I told him he could move out with two conditions: he needed to learn how to cook, and he needed to learn how to go alone in public. That was a couple of weeks ago, we stopped cooking his meals and told him he needed to go alone everywhere he wanted to go. It\u2019s not going well, he hasn't even tried, he simply doordash everything or eats stuff that doesn\u2019t require cooking on the stove, and avoids going out in public, he has been locked in his room since. \n\nNow, my older son came for a visit this weekend. Apparently my younger son wanted to go to the zoo, but he knew his dad and I wouldn\u2019t take him, so he called his brother. I told my older son not to take his brother to the zoo, if he wanted to be an independent adult he should be able to handle going to the zoo by himself.\n\nMy older son said we were  being absurd, that his brother was not going to magically learn to go out  in public alone, and then he took his brother to the zoo. When he dropped his brother back, we got into an argument over this. He said that by stopping taking him to places and cooking for him, I\u2019m punishing his brother for suggesting he wanted to move out. I told him this is not a punishment, any independent adult needs to know how to cook and how to go out in public alone. He says he agrees but that we need to take baby steps here to help his brother be able to do these  things, instead of just stopping doing it for him out of sudden. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable here and my husband agrees, but my older son is acting as if we are assholes.

Others have commented on that but I have a suggestion: are social services/support something you can access in your county? Without being too personal, I have a social worker who connects with services to live independently. I don\u2019t have the same skill set as a person who isn\u2019t disabled, but it doesn\u2019t matter because these supports fill the gaps. When my social worker did intake we talked about the many services and some examples of services are delivered meals, or assistance with people who can help with going out in public, both types that might help your son. I know finding these programs can be hard, and it varies a lot by what country you\u2019re in (I\u2019m speaking from US experience) but you should look into these if you can. It could give him independence in a way that works for him. \n\nAlso maybe introduce him to crock pot cooking. You can do a lot with a crock pot and it\u2019s a lot more approachable than a stove.", "OP you also state younger son is on the spectrum even though he\u2019s high functioning. That means it\u2019s ok for him to do things differently or to need certain accommodations for things in order to live independently. Insisting he function like a \u201cnormal\u201d person is ableist and just plain cruel. You\u2019re undermining the many ways he is able to care for himself.

I have a good friend, who is a good cook, who just uses his two induction \"burners\" to cook things, rather than the stovetop in his apartment.  It is completely functional.\n\nBut yeah, telling someone \"learn to cook\" or \"learn to go out on your own\" without helping them learn it is unlikely to end well.  If you're still his legal guardians, then it is actually your job still to teach him these things... or to surrender legal guardianship.  Your call.", "Ok.\n\nYou ATA ... But let me explain.\n\nI am a \"high functioning\" Autistic individual. My mom encouraged me to be in the kitchen as she prepped dinner for the family every day. She would delegate tasks to me as appropriate. It got to the point that if she told me what we would be cooking, I'd have half the veggies and stuff prepped, and all the pots and pans laid out so she could come in and bring everything together.\n\nAt one point when we had visitors, she literally said \"can you go and get me the thingy for the whatumaycallit\" and I instinctively knew what she wanted, because we had almost become one mind.\n\nSince I moved out of \"home\", I almost never shower or brush my teeth; i don't/can't make phonecalls; I won't go through a drive-thru; ordering food at a restaurant is almost impossible; I forget to eat; the list goes on ...\nMy wife helps me with those things; I am successfully eorking as a Director in the cybersecurity software engineering team for my company, leading a team of 6 engineers and an analyst.

It will makes things easier for him if he does but you don't have the right to place that condition on your son. But expecting him to suddenly start going out alone without planning and preparation is really hopeful at best and cruel at worst. The same applies to cooking. \n\nI have this feeling that you son just wants to get away from you because your expectations are so unrealistic.", "YTA. You need to take baby steps as your son suggested.\n\nTeach him how to cook.

Here's a hint, throwing him off the dock into the deep end isn't gonna work. Instead of helping him with these blocks (late, too), you doubled down on his incompetence and sh*t on his dreams. Shame on you.", "YTA - How did your older son learn to cook and be out on his own in public? I'm willing to bet you didn't just stop making him food or boot him out the door. I know with my son, we started with small trips on his own down the street to the bodega, just like cooking began with sandwiches and soup or mac and cheese while I supervised. You need to think back on how you taught him, then break it down into even smaller steps if necessary for your younger son. Baby steps are absolutely called for; simply going 'okay, you're an adult, you don't need me to do it' is ridiculous and bound to fail.", "This! On the food side of things why not help him to learn to make things without the stove. Even make a menu of his favorite things and do them together, an air fryer and instant pot would probably be great if hes afraid of the stove.", "100% the only correct answer. He has never(?) been on his own in 21 years and is supposed to immediately do it? I work with 21 year olds. Many of them have lived on their own since they were 17/18. Some have their own kids. I still wouldn\u2019t tell them to just go do something they\u2019ve never done before without offering them support. And just like OPs kid they are all eager for independence, over confident, and kind of annoying. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d say fine, figure it out on your own.

YTA for setting obstacles instead of encouraging progress.", "I agree with YTA, but they are concerned gor him that he wouldn't be able to go out/cook even when he needs to which is why they did what they did.\n\nHowever i agree with the older son that if they want him to learn these things they have to teach them instead of expecting him to learn by himself.", "I have no idea where OP is from or if the post is even real, and I don't know a lot about laws either, but I'm from Nicaragua, I have a 56 years old aunt in the spectrum and my 80 years old grandma is still her legal guardian.

And, if as a parent you\u2019ve left it go on for this long, it\u2019s really hard to turn the tide.
