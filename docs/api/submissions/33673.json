Or the skin care routine for black skin. Or how to do box braids. Or how to prepare a black child for encounters with the police. Or what they know about the African Diaspora.\n\nA child is a human with actual needs and not a cute toy. And if you don't know about that person's needs and have no knowledge or experience with their world, you have no business adopting them!\n\nNTA", "NTA at all! The bio mom wants the best life for her baby, and you supported her right to make what is already a very difficult decision. Anyone who feels so entitled to a baby is not ready to have one!", "NTA Saying they should get the kid because they\u2019re a couple and Mary is single is just as bigoted as not considering a placement simply based on race.", "Info - is the bio mom white or not? There are many many stories of children of color being adopted by white parents and them ignoring or even downplaying any race issues that arise. Or don\u2019t even attempt to educate themselves on something like basic care for their hair texture.", "NTA - but no good is going to come of a neighborhood having an opinion on a child\u2019s life. How they came to be adopted by whom is no one\u2019s business.  Adoption is not about the prospective parents.", "NTA I\u2019d assume the birth mother is not white and therefore chose the  person who would know how to deal with things such proper hair care.

I was adopted at the age of 7 and I'm now 42 and don't talk to my parents.", "NTA, but I think your neighbor that brought this up is. This isn't something that needed to be done so publicly, they should have approached Mary without involving the other couple or getting into the issues of race with them. Infertility and adoption are incredibly emotional topics and your neighbor definitely could have handled this more sensitively.", "NTA, and I don't think it's bigoted, but I also don't think it's entirely wrong. \n\nI am sure Mary is a great person, and that's all well and good, but children deserve both a mother and a father in their lives. \n\nI know that statement makes everyone raise their pitchforks and torches, but facts don't really care about how you feel. \n\nThe fact is, children in two parent households, with a Mom and a Dad, just do better in life. Fathers bring something to the table, and so do Mothers. That balance is important, and basically, all of the evidence supports this. \n\nThere's an endless number of couples looking to adopt in the US, so there's absolutely no shortage. \n\nI would think that a woman wanting the absolute best for her baby would place him or her in the care of a mother and a father, and would want that for them. \n\nThat said, it is her choice who to place the baby with, and if she thinks that's the best decision, then okay. Ultimately, you have to respect that, even if I don't like that choice.", "I\u2019m a transracial adoptive parent myself. We\u2019ve never had any difficulties whatsoever and our kids are now secure and mentally healthy young adults, both with a clear sense of who they are. It can work well. \n\nBut it is not the same as cisrace parenting. It can be been controversial in minority communities. And minority birth parents have legitimate fears and concerns for the future of their child. There\u2019s nothing at all bigoted about choosing the family and environment they think provides the best chance for a positive outcome. \n\nI\u2019m going with a gentle ESH. The white aparents are not imo suitable for a transrace placement; if they think this is bigotry they don\u2019t have the mindset or education to be good parents to a black child. But you are also TA. You can gently refuse to agree with them - as long as you stop there. But you overstepped by getting fed up and hauling off. You know no more about this than they do. It isn\u2019t your place.", "NTA. This is a hard judgement for me. It feels weird because if you flip flop it and it was a white kid and the birth mom said I only want white adoptive parents it would be heralded as racism. I understand the bio mom wanting the child to grow up being in touch with their culture though (if those are her reasons), ESPECIALLY if they are adopted because they will already feel disconnected in a way due to being given up (if they know). As far as hair care, youtube exists. I don't think a good family should be passed up just because of their skin color regardless, but I do understand that there are many things a white couple might not think about that a young black man or woman in America may need to know when encountering things such as racism, prejudice, and bias that a white parent may not have the same viewpoint on. For example, and this is awful and it's not right but this is the world we're living in, interacting with the police may be taught differently. So I don't think it's racism driving bio mom in this scenario (I think it's probably a fear that placing the child with a white couple might deprive the child of being in touch with their culture), but I do think it's sad because there are many shitty foster parents out there and not enough good people willing to adopt (EDIT: ALL KIDS NOT JUST INFANTS) I hope the couple still keeps their heart open to adopt and that the placement of the child with Mary works out great \u2764\ufe0f Edit: also this is just assuming bio mom/child are black. If bio mom and child are white, that would be a odd request.\nEDIT: This is not to say all foster parents are awful. There are many truly good ones, but I have first hand experience with horror stories.", "There are two families who want to adopt and only one baby. In any situation, the Peters would have been disappointed when Mary adopted and they didn't. They are right, it isn't fair that one gets gets a baby and the others don't. Nothing fair about that all. It sucks that life isn't fair. But the Peters will get over it when they adopt their kid.\n\nTo the extent that you should have sympathized more with the Peter's wanting a child and been less vocal about birth mother's rights, yes, as you suspected, you earned a small YTA.\n\nAs far as the neighborhood quarrel, had the Peters gotten the black child, the talk about robbing the child of its culture would have circulated. The neighborhood know-it-alls are going to squawk no matter what happens.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep in mind that this study is supposed to /challenge/ that narrative, and yet still admits that, on average, kids do better in two parent homes. \n\nHere it is: \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/\n\nThen there's this book, which I recommend reading:\n\nhttps://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo205550079.html\n\nHere's another source that highlights the issue and challenges the narrative that two-parent households do not matter: \n\nhttps://ifstudies.org/blog/do-two-parents-matter-more-than-ever\n\nI am sure there are responses to this. I have read some. But I'm not convinced by them. It just seems pretty clear to me that kids raised in two parent households tend to do better. \n\nMaybe not every single kid does, but definitely more so than not.", "Infants maybe, but 1000s of kids never get adopted and age out of the system.

I hope my child does not have to grow up like that. Hopefully we will be good parents.

A right-wing website, a book written by an economist (so *not* someone qualified to talk about children and families), and a study that's over a decade old?", "Notice that I specifically said infants, because infants are exactly what the \"good people willing to adopt\" in this scenario wanted. They wanted a baby and then threw a temper tantrum when they didn't get a baby. There's plenty of other \"good people willing to adopt\" just like them. \n\nBut fun bashing on the foster parents actually taking care of the older children with adoption being positioned as superior!

I don't care how infertile you are, if you cannot speak about the birth parents with respect, it's better that you don't adopt.\n\nThis isn't a theoretical discussion of the process or of what should be. This is a couple who decided they were entitled to a child and decided to slander a woman for not providing one on demand. Which, again, just proves the birth mother made the right choice. Unfortunately, a future birth parent may not, and they may do real damage to a child unless someone teaches them how not to inflict their hurt on others.", "This issue is near and dear to my heart for personal reasons I won't get into with a stranger on reddit and maybe I am not the most informed. I don't claim to be. But my comment wasn't meant to offend you and I am sorry if it irritated you. \n\nRegarding the white couple, I didn't view it as a temper tantrum over not getting the child. I viewed it as they felt they had been dealt an injustice in not even being given a chance because of their skin color. But I understand bio mom may have had other reasons for her request and tried to phrase my initial comment to broach both sides and regardless don't think OP is TA. \n\nRegarding good people willing to adopt, yes there are plenty. But not enough that can jump through the stringent hoops of the process and not enough that want the kids who end up in foster homes. And I feel technically adoption is the superior deal for the child. A family who will love them forever hopefully. No more being switched around homes. And I didn't mean to bash ALL foster parents, I know there are some truly good ones. And I wish all were truly good. But, I have had experience with foster parents who only looked at kids as a paycheck or even abused them. And unfortunately that's what sticks out in my mind. \n\nAnyways, I'll stop responding to this and regardless hope everything works out well for the child and all parties. \ud83d\ude4f"]}
