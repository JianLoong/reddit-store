My grandparents passed away and the house was maintained by their children, making it into communal space for all family members to use. The rooms are usually saved for those who visit from out of town like me.\n\nI have a cousin Frank (34m) who also visited but stayed elsewhere. We were close growing up. Frank was married to his high school sweetheart Kim for >10 years with a 6 years old daughter. Kim passed in an accident just a little over a year ago. Frank was more than devastated. \n\nWhat set Frank apart from most guys I know was how deeply he loved his wife. He was an exceptionally happily married man. His good bye phrase to me private or in public was \u201cSee ya miserable single loser later!\u201d He was making fun of how I never had a long time girlfriend. I always took it in good fun; it was nice to see a guy so devoted given that my parents and more than half my aunts and uncles divorced.\n\nA few days after I stayed at my grandparents\u2019 my nephew Tom (17m) showed up with a few friends wanting to watch a movie. Tom lives with my sister nearby. I ordered the boys some pizza and joined them. A bit later, Frank dropped by, wanting to catch up with me. We stayed in the same room and talked. Frank seemed to be doing much better since the last time I saw him a month after Kim\u2019s funeral.\n\nOnce the movie was finished, Tom asked if they could hang out in the room for a while and I said yes. Frank, however, excused himself, saying he needed to pick up his daughter. We hugged good bye and Frank was about to leave when Tom said \u201cWhat? None of that miserable single loser stuff? Welcome to the club. Guess now you\u2019re a miserable single loser, too.\u201d\n\nI could see the colors drained from Frank\u2019s face and he looked like he was going to pass out. I immediately turned to Tom and told him to apologize and now. Tom said why should he apologize and I only raised my voice with \u201cNow!\u201d\n\nTom glared at me but finally looked away and softly said sorry to Frank. Frank just left. Tom\u2019s friends mumbled about how they had to go and quickly cleaned up and left, Tom leaving with them.\n\nLater that night Tom\u2019s father called me from across the country, reprimanding me that I should not shame Tom in front of his friends like that. He said he understood that what Tom said was insensitive but being scolded like a child in front of his friends was not how I should handle this. I could wait and have Tom apologize later.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703232620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18o9xue/aita_for_making_my_nephew_apologize_immediately/", "score": 3089, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you did was ABSOLUTELY the right thing. Tom needed to be told immediately, and in no uncertain terms that what he said was absolutely and completely awful, and that he needed to apologize immediately. Tom literally could have walked up to Frank and sucker punched him in the face and it would have hurt Frank less.\n\nNTA.\n\nIf you haven't already, spend some time talking to Tom's dad and make sure he knows what really happened -- Tom may have described what happened in a way that made him less of a bad guy.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to point out that I also really like what u/South-Negotiation-26 said [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18o9xue/comment/kefwydk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I'd sit down with Tom and explain to him that yes, Frank is indeed a miserable single loser. He's miserable... *because* he's single... *because* he's lost more than Tom can even *begin* to fathom. Rubbing that in Frank's face is just abusively cruel.", "NTA. Teenagers are often still figuring out the line between a joke and an insult. I would personally double down: \"You insulted your uncle and brought up a very painful topic, and instead of accepting and understanding a correction, you called your daddy to complain? I see you still don't understand what you did wrong here. Let's go over it again.\"", "NTA\n\nIt is still a sensitive topic to Frank and Tom making fun of him made him upset. It is right and in good manners to apologize if you make someone upset. If Tom\u2019s friends are going to think less of Tom for having family members who care about him enough to ensure that he was doing the right thing, Tom needs better friends. \n\nSure, it was embarrassing being scolded in public but the kid is 17. He does not need to be coddled.", "Perhaps Tom's father's approach to parenting explains Tom's appalling behavior.\n\nTom shamed himself in front of his friends.  You demonstrated good takes-a-village parenting.  Tom needed to apologize right then, that minute.  You made that happen.  Good for you.\n\nNTA", "He said that bullshit in front of his friends; he can apologize in front of them too.  NTA", "NTA Tom's dad sounds like he needs to be reprimanded in front of his friends too. He probly doesn't have any tho.....", "NTA. \n\nFuck (and I cannot stress this enough) THEM KIDS. \n\nThat insensitive little git needs to learn lessons about respect. \n\nParents ain't taught him by 17, so somebody else ought to. \n\nOnly thing I'd say to change, is you could've kept Tom with you for a minute before he dipped after his friends, and tried to have a more calm discussion about why what he said was so disrespectful. But to simply have raised your voice once to gain compliance? Not the asshole. \n\nYou didn't hit him, you didn't deprive him of food, you didn't make him run until he puked. You raised your voice at him. It happens, and it was reasonably justified.", "WTAF!\n\nNTA.\n\nThat little sh*t is 17 years old! \n\nI audibly gasped when I read that line ... he was extremely lucky that you didn't answer with \"Out! NOW! And don't come back until you know why, AND apologise in detail!\"\n\nAs for his father, he wasn't there, he didn't see Frank's reaction, or the fact that your nephew was going for a performative wind up, _because_ his friends were there; and seriously over-shot.\n\nI think you held your temper admirably, due to super human effort, or simple shock.\n\nIf your brother brings it up again, you explain the scene in bleeding detail.\n\nThat nephew would have a mark against his name in my book, for a very long time.\n\nNTA. But that nephew sure as hell is!", "NTA, Tom is 17 and should know better. insensitive prick. Poor Frank", "Damn! That was cold. Tom is spooky.\n\nNTA this sounds like one of those moments of sudden high emotion\n\nHowever, remember that coerced apologies seldom mean much!\n\nI couldn't give a cuss about you doing it with an audience. Social shaming for asshole moves is a fundamental option for management of a situation in, I imagine, all of human history and likely millennia before. Maybe if he was six? I dunno, he's on the cusp of adulthood now. Tom was insanely callous, in quite a cruel way. If I were the dad this would concern me far more.", "NTA at all, I could understand a bit more if Tom was a child under ten but he\u2019s 17. He definitely knew not to say something like that. Tom and his father are definitely TA here", "NTA. If Tom didn't want to get put in his place infront of his friends, he should've kept his mouth shut. What he said was horrible. I'd honestly be more embarrassed to he Tom's friend based on what he said vs getting in trouble.", "Absolutely NTA. Tom needs to learn what empathy and respect are. And his father needs to learn how to teach his kid what empathy and respect are. They are the AHs.\n\nDark humor like this can possibly be fun. But in this particular situation and how you describe Frank's emotional state, it is obviously a very bad joke to do, and a 17yo boy is supposed to be mature enough to know that. Maybe 10 ou 15 years later this joke could've been funny (also depending on how close Tom and Frank are), but ~1year is not enough to completely heal from this kind of loss to the point of being able to joke about it.", "NTA. \n\n>Kim passed in an accident just a little over a year ago. Frank was more than devastated. \n\nWhat your nephew said was incredibly insensitive and he is old enough to know better. Yeah it's embarrassing to be reprimanded in front of your friends but this was warranted by his words. If Tom's father is more concerned about how his son looks to his friends than how Frank feels then maybe that's the answer to where Tom's insensitivity comes from.", "NTA! You did exactly the right thing! Tom and his father can kick rocks and like it! Insensitive jerks! NTA and I think you\u2019re an effin ROCKSTAR!!! Shut up Tom!", "NTA Sounds to me like people trying to find an excuse to have an issue.\nI'd bet money if you'd have left it and dealt with it later, you'd be hearing all about how you had a go at him out of nowhere.\nIf he can treat people like trash in a room full of people he can deal with the consequences there aswell.", "Yoooo...NTA at all. Honestly, Tom seems to be at about that age where he thinks he's all grow'd up and that he can just say shit without repercussions. He's lucky all he got hit with was a scolding. I think many people would not have been so gentle. Act like a child, get treated like a child. Hopefully he learns from this. Since he went and cried to daddy though, I'm doubtfull.", "NTA and screw Tom's father for his double standards for about being insensitive to his son's feelings of being embarrassed front of his friends, as if that trumps here! I don't think so!", "Oh my heart broke for Frank when I got to the part of your story where I knew what was coming. NTA. You did exactly what you should have. You taught all those kids a lesson that night. 17 is emotionally young for the depth of what Frank and his daughter experienced. Tom needed to know, tell his dad too. I figure he probably got a shortened teen version. I hope Frank is doing okay and slowly getting back to life again.", "NTA. Long time parent here and you handled it perfectly. The kid is 17 and was an AH, he deserves to be told to apologize. It will make him a better person in the long run. You just don't say shit like that to somebody recovering from a loss. Tom's father needs to get over himself.", "NTA. When saying something this thoughtless, he SHOULD FEEL BAD. That is one way to learn not to be so thoughtless in the future.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. His comment was vile, not a banter among relatives. And this needed to be addressed immediately. \n\nYour nephew felt humiliated in front of his friends? Well, so not sorry. He deserved it.", "NTA\n\nHe said it in front of his friends, he can apologize in front of his friends.  Obviously, this was very embarrassing for him, but it will also be a lesson he will remember.  Hopefully, he will be a better (or at least better-behaved) person going forward.", "I\u2019m not saying this is right, but\u2026 years ago in my family Tom would have been dropped like a bag of spuds.", "NTA. Tom got off a lot lighter than he deserved.", "NTA, little shits need to learn respect.", "NTA, Tom is 17 practically an adult and at this point should know right from wrong.  You nipped his shitty behavior right away. He was trying to act all cool infront of his friends and now he knows the consequences for his bad behavior. His dad is as much of a dick as Tom was.", "NTA. I don't know who these people are that think 'oh you should wait and tell him when...' -NO. If someone does something shitty it must be acknowledged immediately if not sooner and then made to understand why it was shitty.", "NTA. Your nephew needed a serious wake up call.", "NTA  This was exactly the time to make him apologize. When he said it. Hopefully his friends knew of the situation and by your immediate reprimand they understood how bad the comment was. Since he called his dad chances are some of his friends got on him too. You handled it exactly right.", "If the bad behaviour occurred in public, the apology can also.", "NTA. Don't want to be scolded in public? Don't be an asshole in public, then.", "Nta\n\n\nTom is lucky he didn't end up with a different colored eyes. He's old enough to know how incredibly malicious it was. His intention was to cause pain to look cool to his friends. He's a bad bad seed.", "\"A child\"\n\nPlease, 17 years old is not a child. You did the right thing here, good man.\n\nNTA", "I don't think anyone is an A here.\n\nI'm not sure an apology was the right way to go. But this was definitely a teachable moment.\n\nThe nephew obviously had seen Frank's farewell statement before. He probably saw it multiple times. I can't tell if it was meant maliciously but I doubt it. I think he was trying to be witty and completely failed. He lacked the social awareness to understand all of the implications of what he said.\n\nI want fault the op for reacting the way he did. But I also won't fall the father for pointing out what he did. He definitely should have been talked to about how he went wrong with that social interaction.\n\nI like to think better of people and therefore the nephew was not intending to be mean.", "NTA, he was behaving like a child with that comment and him having to apologize for his bad behavior is NOT a punishment for a child, but basically what anyone at any age should do. Having to do it in front of his friends is probably what will make him be more careful next time. Entirely appropriate response. Fully NTA.", "NTA\nThe thing about being 17 is that you have no real grasp of how devastating a loss like that can be. Tom thought he was being funny but this is an incredibly serious and emotional subject for Frank and Tom doesn't have to understand that to know he shouldn't make jokes about death. He made an error and getting him to apologise, in front of his friends, will help him understand that he should keep those kinds of unhelpfully thoughts and comments to himself in future.", "NTA - your nephew was rude and insensitive and only by addressing it immediately will he learn to think before he speaks. Good on you for stepping in.", "NTA", "he acted like a child and you did right. NTA", "Nta. But i hope your nephew\u2019s friends see how sh**ty he is and ditch him. People who are like that don\u2019t deserve any sympathy. Plus hes 17. He should know not to say something that insensitive", "NTA \n\nYou did well, Uncle. You did well.", "NTA.\n\nHe acted like an immature child and got scolded like one. 17 or 70, doesn't matter. You are treated with the respect you deserve and at that moment, he didn't deserve any. Unforgivable. (Also, funny his dad said this to you, not the mom that he lives with, that says a lot honestly)", "NTA at all. I'd snap just as bad, if not worse so I think you handled that fairly well", "NTA if Tom is big enough and wants to be treated as an adult, he can 1. Own his fuck up 2. Don't be getting his Daddy to call to solve the problems he created. His father is doing him no favours.", "Frank kinda brought this on himself to be honest. You may have taken it in good jest, but a decade of jokingly telling single people they're miserable losers, was always going to hurt someone's feelings. It didn't hurt yours, but that doesn't mean that Frank doesn't also owe people an apology. ESH", "NTA If you don\u2019t want to be scolded like a child, don\u2019t behave like one.", "NTA he act like a child so treat me like a child, actually he acted like a brat", "YTA / ESH.\n\nSounds like Frank has been enabled by all to use that phrase with impunity over the years. Just because OP is fine with it, that doesn\u2019t mean others are.\n\nTom could have been harbouring resentment for years if he feels that an uncle has been verbally bullying him. It\u2019s unfortunate that he felt able to fight back when Frank is at a low point. \n\nWhat OP has done is confirm that Franks feelings matter and nobody else is allowed to call him out. The way the apology was forced reinforces the fact that bullying is ok.\n\nIf this is the watershed moment where bullying is no longer tolerated in the family, great. That should be communicated to all.\n\nI think OP should talk with Tom and apologise for the nature of how what he said was delivered, but not the overall message. OP should then talk with Frank and tell him that the consequences of his saying has hit home.", "INFO:  Did Tom know about the recent death of Frank's fiancee?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When he gets into the real world and treats someone he doesn\u2019t know with that level of disrespect and cruelty\u2026 let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not going to end well for him because they aren\u2019t going to be as kind as you were.", "NTA, but i wonder if Tom was trying to get back at his 2nd cousin thats been a jerk to his uncle his whole life (in Tom's mind).

I think Tom\u2019s dad is a massive asshole because if my son ever said that to anybody I would be MORTIFIED like please let the earth swallow me because the embarrassment is enough to kill me and I would feel like a failure as a parent. I get kids (Tom is still technically a kid and it is normal for boys at that age to lack maturity) say inappropriate things occasionally and he is trying to figure out socially acceptable jokes but he definitely crossed a line. You did the right thing and the ONLY acceptable response from Tom\u2019s dad would have been to agree with your actions, give an appropriate punishment such as grounding or whatever they seem appropriate and have a serious conversation to help Tom why what he did was wrong and cruel and to encourage a genuine apology to Frank. Regardless if Tom apologizes to Frank or not genuinely his dad should have after hearing what happened. You should re-explain it to his dad but I agree with many commentators that Tom is too old to be coddled and reprimanded in private. That\u2019s not how the real world works and when he offends somebody they\u2019re not going to pull him to the side to talk about it, they\u2019re going to reply in real time in front of everybody. You did Tom a favor by calling him out because I guarantee you if he said that to somebody that didn\u2019t love him he would be getting punched in the face and way more embarrassed than he was by you. He was able to say that in front of his friends then he can deal with the consequences. Even little kids would be called out on that maybe a softer delivery explaining why they shouldn\u2019t say that and they should apologize but most people wouldn\u2019t just stand by and let a kid say that without correcting them in the moment much less a teenager who is almost an adult.", "If Tom didn't want to be shamed in front of his friends, he shouldn't have said shameful things in front of them.

There are instances where this is warranted, it is true.\n\nBut Tom is a whole seventeen years old. He knew he was being a dick. This isn't a case of someone making a sincere accident, he was being an edgy teen looking to score laughs with his friends by punching down on someone.
