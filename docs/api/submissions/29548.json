The music is relatively tame/quiet and fairly emotional - in my opinion, seeing this artist is a pretty immersive music experience, at least for me. I was really excited to see this particular show at a seated theater where it\u2019s easier to just focus on the music. I\u2019d venture a guess that most of the people who would go to this type of show are going because they\u2019re emotionally invested in this person\u2019s music. \n\nThe show starts, and I notice the woman sitting directly next to me is knitting. Odd, I thought, but okay. \n\nBut as the show went on, I kept finding myself so distracted by this knitting. I must have tried for a solid 30 minutes to ignore it, but the constant motion in my peripheral vision + the quiet clicking of the needles kept stealing my attention away from the show. After awhile, I felt like I couldn\u2019t focus on the show at all, and all I could think about was whether I should try to politely say something. The woman was with a partner, and I noticed on their other side there were 2-3 open seats. \n\nSo I finally worked up the courage to politely say something. I thought the best and least disruptive way to do that was to write a note on my phone and show it to her, so that\u2019s what I did. \n\nThe note said (this is a direct copy/paste) - \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to ask and I know this is probably ridiculous but the knitting is distracting me from enjoying the show..: would you mind either stopping or moving one seat over? Again I\u2019m sorry \u201c\n\nIdk, I assumed anyone who knitted in public, and especially someone at this kind of very chill show, was probably a generally chill human, so I was not expecting the kind of negative reaction that followed. The woman gave me the NASTIEST look, let out an angry sigh, threw her hands up, dramatically stuffed her knitting stuff into her bag, huffed and puffed to her partner, and then got up and COMPLETELY LEFT THE SHOW. I was so baffled by how angry she got, especially since I tried really hard to phrase this as politely as I could.  \n\nI even considered that maybe there are reasons beyond my understanding why someone might not be able to sit still during a show and might need to keep their hands busy, (Neurodivergence? Some sort of recovery? Some other reason?) so I REALLY tried to avoid speaking up out of sensitivity, and again it\u2019s why I included the suggestion that maybe she could just slide over instead of stopping completely. \n\nI realize that knitting is definitely not the MOST disruptive thing a person could do, and I couldn\u2019t tell if me asking her to stop was unreasonable and maybe I should have just sucked it up, but I thought I was polite about it and I\u2019m still just really shocked at how mad she got and even more shocked that she completely left the show halfway through the set. \n\nSo - AITA for asking her to stop knitting or move one seat over?\n\nETA - I think the use of the word \u201cconcert\u201d is misleading people here and people might think concert = loud environment. This was a fairly quiet folk show at a theater, as opposed to a rock or pop concert at an arena. The room was dead silent outside of the performance itself. The set included some full band songs, some solo acoustic, some that were just vocals + fiddle + guitar. The needles did make a clicking sound, probably equivalent to someone typing on their phone with long nails.

Anyone saying otherwise has never been to a stripped down folk / acoustic show - you can hear a pin drop as the audiences are generally very quiet, similar to a classical concert. The clickety-clack of knitting needles would certainly be audible, and would certainly be distracting if you were sat close.\n\nPlus, as someone who has played dozens of shows like this, seeing someone in the audience just knitting away would be demoralizing as a performer and would feel pretty disrespectful. I don't knit, so I would assume it had their full attention and they weren't particularly interested in my music.", "NTA. You asked nicely and moving one chair over seems like a reasonable suggestion. I find the clicking of needles to be a soothing sound when I knit, but I agree that it\u2019s definitely a sound that isn\u2019t easy to ignore (especially if they\u2019re metal). \n\nHer reaction was pretty out of proportion to the ask.", "NTA. Anyone who\u2019d walk out on a music performance if she can\u2019t knit her way through it is on her own. You were entirely within bounds making a reasonable request to remove a distracting activity, not customary at this sort of a public gathering, out of your peripheral view and earshot. Your suggestion was polite and considerate. The lady was the problem, not you.", "Lol this thread is crazy NTA you did it as politely as you could \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f if someone right next to me was fidgeting for hours at a show I\u2019d lose my mind no matter how quiet people want to say kitting is you\u2019re going to a concert!", "Lol on the surface her knitting does seem pretty harmless and chill, but at a place like that it's just straight fuckery. It would bother me too to see the constant knitting motion in my peripheral vision and hearing a faint clicks. You handled it pretty well. The lady seemed very entitled. Her partner was probably aware of her Kare-like behavior, and he may have made the call to leave the show instead of letting her cause a scene.", "NTA.  Folks saying otherwise are just wrong.  Going to a concert does not mean you get to control the space around you so completely, or prevent others from occupying their hands.

Leaving this comment to explain why someone would do this. I personally struggle to concentrate when my hands aren\u2019t busy. So eg. in a meeting or listening to a podcast, if I\u2019m knitting or doodling or doing something to keep my hands busy it\u2019s actually easier to listen. So I bet she was better able to enjoy the music while knitting. However there are social norms in a theatre, knitting does make a clicking noise, so she was the asshole for taking her knitting to a show, and then even more the asshole for being dramatic when you asked her to stop.", "NTA I think you handled it as well as you could have.", "As a knitter and friend of knitters, NTA. My friends will knit places I wouldn't dare (i.e., church) as a way of keeping their hands busy. Kind of like how I used to doodle in class - it helped me pay attention.\n\nBut even if she had a genuine medical need (some kind of neurodivergence, as you said), moving over a seat isn't a huge ask when there are other seats to be had.\n\nI don't find knitting particularly distracting, but istg I can't hear or see anything else if a TV is on in the room I'm in, and I imagine it's rather similar.\n\nI think you would only be TA if you had seats next to you that you could move to and instead made it her problem, or if you had been rude about it.", "Nta. That would be distracting", "NTA. Your request was polite. She overreacted.", "So I am absolutely someone who might knit in a setting like that, in part due to ADHD.

The knitting is disrespectful to the artist. Imagine how they must have felt, looking out into the crowd and seeing some woman knitting. It's just odd. And since it was disturbing at least one other person around her, it was disrespectful to the audience as well. You don't go to a live performance to knit. That's simply not the venue for such a thing.  \n\n\nYou were polite about it and explained that it was affecting your experience. She clearly didn't want to be there anyway. You're good.", "You were polite, She overreacted. She was annoying and inconsiderate of other people having to constantly hear the needles clicking. It would be torture for me hearing that.

On the one hand I can see how the woman would feel embarrassed by this, honestly- I\u2019m someone who needs to be doing something with my hands too, even if I\u2019m interested in the music/show.

You also suggested a great idea that would allow you both to be comfy. \n\nI\u2019m guessing she felt embarrassed or hurt and that\u2019s why she reacted that way.

When behaviours actively harm the experiences of others, it\u2019s only natural to want to find a constructive and effective path through.

Knitting and crochet are common for this sort of thing too.\n\nIt was just knitting.  I've got misophonia so I do get it to some extent, the way even small noises can become big irritations, but come on.

It seems like this might be the case because both the sound and the motion drove you to distraction. It sounds to me like you were mildly annoyed to start and worked yourself up into a froth. I do think it\u2019s pretty entitled that you asked her to move instead of just moving yourself. \n\nUsually knitters keep their work in their laps because that\u2019s where it\u2019s most comfortable- was this an angled seat where you could look down into her lap?

Do you think talking and making a scene during the show was maybe more of a distraction to everyone else than the knitting was?", "Yes, I\u2019m a knitter so I do know how it works, and ime the yarn itself is usually enough of a buffer to muffle the sound of needles making contact (even when they do it\u2019s more of a shhhh and not a sharp clack clack). I just have never been in a situation where the sound is so extreme it could be heard by others. I\u2019m not ruling it out, I\u2019m just skeptical it was as distracting as OP has said (especially since he has since flipped to say it was the motion that was distracting).

There were a few directly next to her and her partner.", "Right, except, it did make noise. They were (I think) metal knitting needles?
