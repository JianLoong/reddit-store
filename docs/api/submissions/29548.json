The music is relatively tame/quiet and fairly emotional - in my opinion, seeing this artist is a pretty immersive music experience, at least for me. I was really excited to see this particular show at a seated theater where it\u2019s easier to just focus on the music. I\u2019d venture a guess that most of the people who would go to this type of show are going because they\u2019re emotionally invested in this person\u2019s music. \n\nThe show starts, and I notice the woman sitting directly next to me is knitting. Odd, I thought, but okay. \n\nBut as the show went on, I kept finding myself so distracted by this knitting. I must have tried for a solid 30 minutes to ignore it, but the constant motion in my peripheral vision + the quiet clicking of the needles kept stealing my attention away from the show. After awhile, I felt like I couldn\u2019t focus on the show at all, and all I could think about was whether I should try to politely say something. The woman was with a partner, and I noticed on their other side there were 2-3 open seats. \n\nSo I finally worked up the courage to politely say something. I thought the best and least disruptive way to do that was to write a note on my phone and show it to her, so that\u2019s what I did. \n\nThe note said (this is a direct copy/paste) - \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to ask and I know this is probably ridiculous but the knitting is distracting me from enjoying the show..: would you mind either stopping or moving one seat over? Again I\u2019m sorry \u201c\n\nIdk, I assumed anyone who knitted in public, and especially someone at this kind of very chill show, was probably a generally chill human, so I was not expecting the kind of negative reaction that followed. The woman gave me the NASTIEST look, let out an angry sigh, threw her hands up, dramatically stuffed her knitting stuff into her bag, huffed and puffed to her partner, and then got up and COMPLETELY LEFT THE SHOW. I was so baffled by how angry she got, especially since I tried really hard to phrase this as politely as I could.  \n\nI even considered that maybe there are reasons beyond my understanding why someone might not be able to sit still during a show and might need to keep their hands busy, (Neurodivergence? Some sort of recovery? Some other reason?) so I REALLY tried to avoid speaking up out of sensitivity, and again it\u2019s why I included the suggestion that maybe she could just slide over instead of stopping completely. \n\nI realize that knitting is definitely not the MOST disruptive thing a person could do, and I couldn\u2019t tell if me asking her to stop was unreasonable and maybe I should have just sucked it up, but I thought I was polite about it and I\u2019m still just really shocked at how mad she got and even more shocked that she completely left the show halfway through the set. \n\nSo - AITA for asking her to stop knitting or move one seat over?\n\nETA - I think the use of the word \u201cconcert\u201d is misleading people here and people might think concert = loud environment. This was a fairly quiet folk show at a theater, as opposed to a rock or pop concert at an arena. The room was dead silent outside of the performance itself. The set included some full band songs, some solo acoustic, some that were just vocals + fiddle + guitar. The needles did make a clicking sound, probably equivalent to someone typing on their phone with long nails.

Anyone saying otherwise has never been to a stripped down folk / acoustic show - you can hear a pin drop as the audiences are generally very quiet, similar to a classical concert. The clickety-clack of knitting needles would certainly be audible, and would certainly be distracting if you were sat close.\n\nPlus, as someone who has played dozens of shows like this, seeing someone in the audience just knitting away would be demoralizing as a performer and would feel pretty disrespectful. I don't knit, so I would assume it had their full attention and they weren't particularly interested in my music.", "NTA. You asked nicely and moving one chair over seems like a reasonable suggestion. I find the clicking of needles to be a soothing sound when I knit, but I agree that it\u2019s definitely a sound that isn\u2019t easy to ignore (especially if they\u2019re metal). \n\nHer reaction was pretty out of proportion to the ask.", "NTA. Anyone who\u2019d walk out on a music performance if she can\u2019t knit her way through it is on her own.

Your suggestion was polite and considerate.

It would bother me too to see the constant knitting motion in my peripheral vision and hearing a faint clicks. You handled it pretty well. The lady seemed very entitled. Her partner was probably aware of her Kare-like behavior, and he may have made the call to leave the show instead of letting her cause a scene.", "NTA.  Folks saying otherwise are just wrong.  Going to a concert does not mean you get to control the space around you so completely, or prevent others from occupying their hands.

Leaving this comment to explain why someone would do this. I personally struggle to concentrate when my hands aren\u2019t busy. So eg. in a meeting or listening to a podcast, if I\u2019m knitting or doodling or doing something to keep my hands busy it\u2019s actually easier to listen. So I bet she was better able to enjoy the music while knitting. However there are social norms in a theatre, knitting does make a clicking noise, so she was the asshole for taking her knitting to a show, and then even more the asshole for being dramatic when you asked her to stop.", "NTA I think you handled it as well as you could have.", "As a knitter and friend of knitters, NTA. My friends will knit places I wouldn't dare (i.e., church) as a way of keeping their hands busy. Kind of like how I used to doodle in class - it helped me pay attention.\n\nBut even if she had a genuine medical need (some kind of neurodivergence, as you said), moving over a seat isn't a huge ask when there are other seats to be had.\n\nI don't find knitting particularly distracting, but istg I can't hear or see anything else if a TV is on in the room I'm in, and I imagine it's rather similar.\n\nI think you would only be TA if you had seats next to you that you could move to and instead made it her problem, or if you had been rude about it.", "Nta.

The knitting is disrespectful to the artist. Imagine how they must have felt, looking out into the crowd and seeing some woman knitting. It's just odd.

That's simply not the venue for such a thing.  \n\n\nYou were polite about it and explained that it was affecting your experience. She clearly didn't want to be there anyway.

You also suggested a great idea that would allow you both to be comfy. \n\nI\u2019m guessing she felt embarrassed or hurt and that\u2019s why she reacted that way.

I just have never been in a situation where the sound is so extreme it could be heard by others. I\u2019m not ruling it out, I\u2019m just skeptical it was as distracting as OP has said (especially since he has since flipped to say it was the motion that was distracting).

She could have refused, moved over, or acted like a giant baby. Looks like she chose the later. \nNTA\nP.S. I've had someone ask me to tone it down at a Black Sabbath concert I laughed at them and told them to move to back of the crowd. If I was an accoustic show I would have apologized and turned the dial down", "NTA. I crochet due to my neurodivergencies in overstimulating spaces.

She thinks nothing of it when I\u2019m hosting nearly thirty people for Thanksgiving in my tiny house.", "NTA I knit through concerts, and specifically pack needles which are less likely to make noise, I.e. bamboo, plastic, ext.. you proposed a very reasonable alternative, and her reaction was completely over the top.", "OP is NTA.  Any extra noise at a live event like this is disrespectful to both the artist and audience.  If the knitter reads this, I suggest short wooden needles.

I also like knitting. But if I went to a concert, especially this kind where the music ain\u2019t blasting, if I needed something to fidget with my hands I would make sure it was something that made no noise. The noise knitting needles make is really annoying and no matter how you try you can\u2019t do it quietly. You were not only in the right in my opinion but you also handled the situation really politely. NTA for sure on this one. Moving seats would have been easiest way for everyone involved to enjoy the concert but for some reason dramatically leaving the whole concert was the choice they made. You did good. You were respectful and polite, and complete in your rights here.", "NTA. Her actions are disrespectful to the performer, and in a quiet environment the click clack of knitting needles would be so hard to ignore. Good on you for politely asking her to move.

I knit in public all the time. Concerts, bars, outdoor events, sports games, pretty much anywhere there\u2019s enough light to see my work. One time a ball of yarn escaped my bag, rolled across the floor, and came to rest against the stage of the local juke joint where we were seeing our favorite band play. After the song ended, the lead singer stepped down and handed it back to me. So yeah, knitting in public is a thing. \n\nThat being said, if I EVER had an inkling that my actions were negatively impacting someone else, I would ABSOLUTELY make adjustments. I know I\u2019m distracting. I even had a guy come up to me after a concert and tell me he was \u201cmesmerized\u201d by me knitting in time with the music. But I\u2019m also a decent human being who cares about the happiness of others. Obviously this lady is not. \n\nThe saddest part (I\u2019m guessing) is that interaction probably overshadowed the REST of the concert for you and I bet you had a miserable time.

There are certain standards of behavior at a performance.  If it is at a more casual venue that\u2019s one thing, but a concert where you can have moments of silence? Clicking of knitting and doing the knitting seems inconsiderate.  I get that knitters say they can concentrate on the performance while knitting but that is being oblivious to others in the room.  If it was neurodivergence that is helped by it, I think sitting one seat away on the other side of their guest would not have been an issue.  The person would have been aware that it was distracting for another person who came to experience the concert.", "I knit as a hobby for probably four hours a day. It helps me focus more in class and it helps me listen to people better. That being said I understand that the general population of people who don't knit wouldn't understand that and would get a different connotation from it so I pick my battles to be respectful. I wouldn't knit in a meeting with a client on zoom. I wouldn't knit at a dinner party. I wouldn't knit once a show starts because I would assume it looks rude.\n\nEven as a knitter, I understand what you're saying. Everyone on busses now are scrolling on phones and when I'm reading, I have to physically block screens in my peripheral out with my hand sometimes or turn away.\n\nIf there was a seat beside her, a perfectly reasonable compromise, that's great, NTA. She was just offended and that has nothing to do with the kind way you brought it up. Same thing when I'm driving a car, pedestrians are always the problem, and when I'm walking, drivers are what's wrong with the whole world.

A concert, gig, show it whatever you like to call it is there for the audience to enjoy the music. \n\n\nA festival or something like that is more a general experience with more leeway where knitting can be a thing without any real impact to the audience. Something like folk music or anything along those lines knitting is just more in your face, the clicking sound is irritating if you've paid good money to hear the show and strikes me as boarding on obnoxious. \n\n\nIf someone has anxiety then it is up to them to manage it in an unobtrusive way as possible per the event they are attending and their needs do not beat out everyone else's that is attending the gig - an amicable balance should be sought taking as much into account as possible but ultimately distractions to others should be a no. \n\n\nAlso the anxiety point was just speculation as to why this person was knitting and from what I read they just got irritated at the note and went off in a huff.

I can understand why she might have thought bringing knitting was a good idea- some knitters knit while they watch tv or in classes because it keeps their hands busy while they watch/listen, but that\u2019s very different from the atmosphere OP described. I think OP would be getting way fewer y-t-a votes if it was a symphony performance, which I think is a comparable atmosphere to the concert they were attending. \n\nOP, you asked her to quiet down or move, explained why, and were polite and non-disruptive in the way you asked.

You would still get shushed if you were just talking, but making noise and even yelling out stuff at some points was kind of expected.\n\nUSA, big country, many cultures.", "This is so rare don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal. I\u2019ve been to hundred of movies and they were quiet minus kids crying at times", "Today I add see a movie outside of the US to my bucket list. \n\nI stopped going to theaters 2 decades ago because the other people made me want to start cracking heads together. Paying that much money to have constant chatter in the audience was not fun at all so I just stopped going. \n\nThe original X-Men was the last movie I saw in an actual theater.", "Best movie going experience I have ever had in the US was on a Disney Cruise ship, opening day, midnight, Avengers Endgame. Movies on Disney Cruises are free and this was the first day of a one week cruise. In other words nothing but adults and fans. Massive fans. I have been to a lot of movies (and am American), most theaters are quiet (especially Alamo Drafthouse who kicks out anyone who talks or is on their phone), but this movie experience by a bunch of very tired people seeing it in the best place possible as soon as they could? Nothing compares and that audience was clearly excited and made just the right noises at the right spots. And that movie the noises were warranted. Totally depends on the movie.", "Yeah, I was timid when I started and only did it in huge classes where there were 200 students so no one even noticed, but by the end I was doing it in classes with like 15 students as long as my professor was chill (there were a couple professors I think would have cared so I avoided it there). I retained so much more info when I was cross stitching. Even now I cross stitch when watching a show I have never seen before because I have enough attention to know what is going on. If I\u2019m playing video games or browsing Reddit I watch a show I\u2019ve already seen because otherwise I get sooooo lost.", "When my grandparents got married, in 1953, my Nana would knit while they listened to the radio at night. The clicking drove my Granddad insane, so he asked her to teach him how to knit, figuring the sound wouldn't bother him if he were making it. He went on to win awards for his knitting and they both knitted all of my family's jumpers for nearly sixty years.", "I keep a set of these ancient plastic interchangeable for knitting at quiet places. I love my steel ultra sharps but the plastics are silent", ">Crochet is looked down on a lot compared to knitting\n\nWait... what? People look down on crochet? I crochet, and I've made some amazing afghans and toys/decorations. Why do people look down on that?", "People look down on crocheting? What for? I feel like it's much more flexible than knitting.", "No it\u2019s not. That\u2019s crazy.", "I didn't use you as anything. It was just a discussion. Nobody did. People are saying it could be a reason \n\nAnd I actually have said time and time again that OP is not an asshole at all.", "By that logic, I could go around defining any behaviour as \"disrupting my enjoyment\".\n\nRed shirts freak me out. Someone was wearing one at a concert so I asked if they could change or leave.\n\nBecause \"their right to wear a red shirt ends at disrupting my enjoyment\".\n\nPeople are owed accommodation just because they feel slightly uncomfortable.", "Not even being asked to stop, being asked to move 1-2 seats over into available space.", "It's a situation of competing needs. Both should do what they can to regulate themselves, and if you know each other, try to compromise. No one is morally wrong.", "I'm another neurodivergent public knitter and I agree.  I bring socks with wooden needles or something similarly small and quiet to theater-like situations, and often I'm knitting only while waiting for the performance to start or during intermission.  I stim with my hands in my lap if necessary, twiddling my thumbs.  I sometimes knit during something, usually movies, but because showing I go to are never crowded I feel there's no one close enough to be bothered.   At a live show, sitting imo unnaturally close to strangers for a long amount of time, you have to be extra considerate.\n\nAlso, if there were open seats near me well after the show started I would have moved without being asked!", "That part! The other woman isn\u2019t TA for knitting, she is for the reaction. OP is NTA at all for asking someone politely to be mindful that there are other people around her.", "I need to get on your level lol. My husband was supposed to come with me, but he got sick. He got me these tickets as a birthday present and we were supposed to have a whole big date night. \n\nHe is newly getting into folk music within the last few years, loves banjo and fiddle, and the whole show I kept thinking how undeniably beautiful the performance was and how much my husband would have LOVED it. \n\nGuess I just gotta catch the next run again!", "If the person was merely fidgeting discreetly I'd agree. Bringing a craft project to serve as a full second activity is just extremely rude.", "Took me forever to find some mention of wooden needles in these comments like they\u2019re a godsend when you want to sneak some knitting in. Metal draws way too much attention and also lets stitches fall off way too easy.", "Get a tablet with a cover that let's it stand up on its own, and the kindle app. It's a game changer, because you just need a split second swipe to turn the page, and you can stand the tablet wherever makes it easiest. It's honestly made my knitting and reading possible, although it might not work for everyone.", "Depending on the pattern and its complexity, I may or may not be able to knit while talking.", "I can do plain knitting in the dark. Like stockinette. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do much more than that.", "I'm pretty experienced, and I think it really depends on the stitch/pattern. Garter stitch on a scarf? That can be done in the dark. Multiple cable patterns on a glove? I'm going to need an old-timey miner's helmet on that one.", "Username checks out", "Yep until the end and THEN people might cheer or clap, rarely during the movie.\n\nUnless it\u2019s something like rocky horror picture show and then you\u2019re kinda, like\u2026supposed to yell the stuff out", "On the flipside of that, when I went to the theater on the opening weekend of Avengers Infinity War at the end of the movie it was absolutely dead silent as the credits started to roll.  Then suddenly one dude at the front of the theater (who apparently didn't know that it was a Part 1 of 2) yelled out \"Man, this is some bullshit!\"\n\nI could barely keep myself from laughing out loud at that.", "It totally makes the long flight times more bearable too! (I didn't play Retail, so I suffered. xD)", "Ok that\u2019s adorable.", "I love that! My mom has a pair of booties her dad knitted for her when she was born.", "So wholesome! \n\nIf you can't beat 'em, join 'em! :-)", "Respectfully disagree. If one person is regulating by being both noisy and visually distracting at a small, quiet performance that is not a case of \"competing needs\".", "People up and down this thread are complaining about any sort of fidgeting, that they find fidgeting so distracting they can't focus on anything else but the fidgeter. As though anyone who fidgets or has any sort of tic should hide themselves away if they can't be completely silent or still. It's mind boggling. Many people saying since they have ADHD they can't abide others fidgeting... But many people forget because of ADHD... Strange...", "This! I exclusively use wooden needles, so it took me a while to figure out what was so noisy about knitting. I\u2019m very sensitive to noise and I don\u2019t hear my own needles because wooden ones are so quiet. \n\nI would absolutely be someone knitting at a concert or other event. I can\u2019t sit still and don\u2019t focus well when I\u2019m not moving, so knitting (or crocheting) helps that. But I\u2019d have a small project with wooden needles, so small movements and no noise.", "Totally.\n\nObviously it's a great goal, but it wasn't ment completely serious, that's why I added the emoji. (I am in the \"just a crafter taking any excuse I can find to craft some more\" category, so I thought the comment fits here perfectly for people like me).", "It depends on what you\u2019re knitting. The knitting projects I set up for multitask knitting are generally pretty simple and can be done by feel since all I\u2019m doing are basic stitches and each row (or at least every set of two rows) is the same. Had a hat I worked on during a conference and whenever I got to a bit where I\u2019d have to increase or decrease I\u2019d just set it aside and wait to do those rows when I could give it my full attention. Since it was a conference it also needed to be a small enough project that I could set it down in my lap mid-row if needed to take notes. And before anyone gets on me, in my field it\u2019s super normal for there to be at least one knitter in any given conference panel\u2019s audience.", "Depends, are you a member of congress?", "Yeah! The real answer is obviously that we can't afford preventative care!", "Right. People only see the outliers and assume that's the norm.", "Maybe I\u2019d enjoy classic more if I took up knitting lol", "Actually would be kinda funny if people saw the bomb go off in the movie and they all started cheering, fist pumping, clapping, shoulder pats,  hand shakes etc.", "I remember video from cinema in South Korea, when there was the scene about them dropping the bomb on Japan entire cinema cheered which is something that only could have happened there and in China, everywhere else it's a harrowing scene and everyone was so quiet.", "Years ago I went by myself to see Magic Mike and I felt like I was there with my girls because of all the women in the theater hooping and hollering. It was a lot of fun.", "Aaaand now that song is stuck in my head forever", "I saw one of the paranormal activity films in theaters and there was a group across the theater yelling at the screen. \"OH LAWD! DON'T GO IN THE BASEMENT.\" We laughed so hard.", "Seeing Evil Dead Rise over the summer was one of my favorite movie experiences because of this. Me and some friends are going to see Saw X tonight and I was honestly bummed how empty the theater looks, hopefully more people buy tickets.", "Watching Get Out in a packed NYC theater was so fun", "The best part of seeing a horror movie in the theater are the comments you hear around you. I went to see The Strangers and we were surrounded by teens. The guy behind us made the best comments. My favorite was when he yelled out, \u201cdon\u2019t do it white boy! Don\u2019t try to be a hero!\u201d", "I went to the 50th anniversary of The Thing last year, and everyone in the theatre was jumping and gasping at the reveals. It was so much fun!"]}
