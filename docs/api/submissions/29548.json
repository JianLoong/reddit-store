The music is relatively tame/quiet and fairly emotional - in my opinion, seeing this artist is a pretty immersive music experience, at least for me. I was really excited to see this particular show at a seated theater where it\u2019s easier to just focus on the music. I\u2019d venture a guess that most of the people who would go to this type of show are going because they\u2019re emotionally invested in this person\u2019s music. \n\nThe show starts, and I notice the woman sitting directly next to me is knitting. Odd, I thought, but okay. \n\nBut as the show went on, I kept finding myself so distracted by this knitting. I must have tried for a solid 30 minutes to ignore it, but the constant motion in my peripheral vision + the quiet clicking of the needles kept stealing my attention away from the show. After awhile, I felt like I couldn\u2019t focus on the show at all, and all I could think about was whether I should try to politely say something. The woman was with a partner, and I noticed on their other side there were 2-3 open seats. \n\nSo I finally worked up the courage to politely say something. I thought the best and least disruptive way to do that was to write a note on my phone and show it to her, so that\u2019s what I did. \n\nThe note said (this is a direct copy/paste) - \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to ask and I know this is probably ridiculous but the knitting is distracting me from enjoying the show..: would you mind either stopping or moving one seat over? Again I\u2019m sorry \u201c\n\nIdk, I assumed anyone who knitted in public, and especially someone at this kind of very chill show, was probably a generally chill human, so I was not expecting the kind of negative reaction that followed. The woman gave me the NASTIEST look, let out an angry sigh, threw her hands up, dramatically stuffed her knitting stuff into her bag, huffed and puffed to her partner, and then got up and COMPLETELY LEFT THE SHOW. I was so baffled by how angry she got, especially since I tried really hard to phrase this as politely as I could.  \n\nI even considered that maybe there are reasons beyond my understanding why someone might not be able to sit still during a show and might need to keep their hands busy, (Neurodivergence? Some sort of recovery? Some other reason?) so I REALLY tried to avoid speaking up out of sensitivity, and again it\u2019s why I included the suggestion that maybe she could just slide over instead of stopping completely. \n\nI realize that knitting is definitely not the MOST disruptive thing a person could do, and I couldn\u2019t tell if me asking her to stop was unreasonable and maybe I should have just sucked it up, but I thought I was polite about it and I\u2019m still just really shocked at how mad she got and even more shocked that she completely left the show halfway through the set. \n\nSo - AITA for asking her to stop knitting or move one seat over?\n\nETA - I think the use of the word \u201cconcert\u201d is misleading people here and people might think concert = loud environment. This was a fairly quiet folk show at a theater, as opposed to a rock or pop concert at an arena. The room was dead silent outside of the performance itself. The set included some full band songs, some solo acoustic, some that were just vocals + fiddle + guitar. The needles did make a clicking sound, probably equivalent to someone typing on their phone with long nails.

Anyone saying otherwise has never been to a stripped down folk / acoustic show - you can hear a pin drop as the audiences are generally very quiet, similar to a classical concert. The clickety-clack of knitting needles would certainly be audible, and would certainly be distracting if you were sat close.\n\nPlus, as someone who has played dozens of shows like this, seeing someone in the audience just knitting away would be demoralizing as a performer and would feel pretty disrespectful. I don't knit, so I would assume it had their full attention and they weren't particularly interested in my music.", "NTA. You asked nicely and moving one chair over seems like a reasonable suggestion. I find the clicking of needles to be a soothing sound when I knit, but I agree that it\u2019s definitely a sound that isn\u2019t easy to ignore (especially if they\u2019re metal). \n\nHer reaction was pretty out of proportion to the ask.", "NTA. Anyone who\u2019d walk out on a music performance if she can\u2019t knit her way through it is on her own.

Your suggestion was polite and considerate.

It would bother me too to see the constant knitting motion in my peripheral vision and hearing a faint clicks. You handled it pretty well. The lady seemed very entitled. Her partner was probably aware of her Kare-like behavior, and he may have made the call to leave the show instead of letting her cause a scene.", "NTA.  Folks saying otherwise are just wrong.  Going to a concert does not mean you get to control the space around you so completely, or prevent others from occupying their hands.

Leaving this comment to explain why someone would do this. I personally struggle to concentrate when my hands aren\u2019t busy. So eg. in a meeting or listening to a podcast, if I\u2019m knitting or doodling or doing something to keep my hands busy it\u2019s actually easier to listen. So I bet she was better able to enjoy the music while knitting. However there are social norms in a theatre, knitting does make a clicking noise, so she was the asshole for taking her knitting to a show, and then even more the asshole for being dramatic when you asked her to stop.", "NTA I think you handled it as well as you could have.", "As a knitter and friend of knitters, NTA. My friends will knit places I wouldn't dare (i.e., church) as a way of keeping their hands busy. Kind of like how I used to doodle in class - it helped me pay attention.\n\nBut even if she had a genuine medical need (some kind of neurodivergence, as you said), moving over a seat isn't a huge ask when there are other seats to be had.\n\nI don't find knitting particularly distracting, but istg I can't hear or see anything else if a TV is on in the room I'm in, and I imagine it's rather similar.\n\nI think you would only be TA if you had seats next to you that you could move to and instead made it her problem, or if you had been rude about it.", "Nta.

The knitting is disrespectful to the artist. Imagine how they must have felt, looking out into the crowd and seeing some woman knitting. It's just odd.

That's simply not the venue for such a thing.  \n\n\nYou were polite about it and explained that it was affecting your experience. She clearly didn't want to be there anyway.

You also suggested a great idea that would allow you both to be comfy. \n\nI\u2019m guessing she felt embarrassed or hurt and that\u2019s why she reacted that way.

I just have never been in a situation where the sound is so extreme it could be heard by others. I\u2019m not ruling it out, I\u2019m just skeptical it was as distracting as OP has said (especially since he has since flipped to say it was the motion that was distracting).

She could have refused, moved over, or acted like a giant baby. Looks like she chose the later. \nNTA\nP.S. I've had someone ask me to tone it down at a Black Sabbath concert I laughed at them and told them to move to back of the crowd. If I was an accoustic show I would have apologized and turned the dial down", "NTA. I crochet due to my neurodivergencies in overstimulating spaces.

She thinks nothing of it when I\u2019m hosting nearly thirty people for Thanksgiving in my tiny house.", "NTA I knit through concerts, and specifically pack needles which are less likely to make noise, I.e. bamboo, plastic, ext.. you proposed a very reasonable alternative, and her reaction was completely over the top.", "OP is NTA.  Any extra noise at a live event like this is disrespectful to both the artist and audience.  If the knitter reads this, I suggest short wooden needles.

I also like knitting. But if I went to a concert, especially this kind where the music ain\u2019t blasting, if I needed something to fidget with my hands I would make sure it was something that made no noise. The noise knitting needles make is really annoying and no matter how you try you can\u2019t do it quietly. You were not only in the right in my opinion but you also handled the situation really politely. NTA for sure on this one. Moving seats would have been easiest way for everyone involved to enjoy the concert but for some reason dramatically leaving the whole concert was the choice they made. You did good. You were respectful and polite, and complete in your rights here.", "NTA. Her actions are disrespectful to the performer, and in a quiet environment the click clack of knitting needles would be so hard to ignore. Good on you for politely asking her to move.

I knit in public all the time. Concerts, bars, outdoor events, sports games, pretty much anywhere there\u2019s enough light to see my work. One time a ball of yarn escaped my bag, rolled across the floor, and came to rest against the stage of the local juke joint where we were seeing our favorite band play. After the song ended, the lead singer stepped down and handed it back to me. So yeah, knitting in public is a thing. \n\nThat being said, if I EVER had an inkling that my actions were negatively impacting someone else, I would ABSOLUTELY make adjustments. I know I\u2019m distracting. I even had a guy come up to me after a concert and tell me he was \u201cmesmerized\u201d by me knitting in time with the music. But I\u2019m also a decent human being who cares about the happiness of others. Obviously this lady is not. \n\nThe saddest part (I\u2019m guessing) is that interaction probably overshadowed the REST of the concert for you and I bet you had a miserable time.

There are certain standards of behavior at a performance.  If it is at a more casual venue that\u2019s one thing, but a concert where you can have moments of silence? Clicking of knitting and doing the knitting seems inconsiderate.  I get that knitters say they can concentrate on the performance while knitting but that is being oblivious to others in the room.  If it was neurodivergence that is helped by it, I think sitting one seat away on the other side of their guest would not have been an issue.  The person would have been aware that it was distracting for another person who came to experience the concert.", "I knit as a hobby for probably four hours a day. It helps me focus more in class and it helps me listen to people better. That being said I understand that the general population of people who don't knit wouldn't understand that and would get a different connotation from it so I pick my battles to be respectful. I wouldn't knit in a meeting with a client on zoom. I wouldn't knit at a dinner party. I wouldn't knit once a show starts because I would assume it looks rude.\n\nEven as a knitter, I understand what you're saying. Everyone on busses now are scrolling on phones and when I'm reading, I have to physically block screens in my peripheral out with my hand sometimes or turn away.\n\nIf there was a seat beside her, a perfectly reasonable compromise, that's great, NTA. She was just offended and that has nothing to do with the kind way you brought it up. Same thing when I'm driving a car, pedestrians are always the problem, and when I'm walking, drivers are what's wrong with the whole world.

A concert, gig, show it whatever you like to call it is there for the audience to enjoy the music. \n\n\nA festival or something like that is more a general experience with more leeway where knitting can be a thing without any real impact to the audience. Something like folk music or anything along those lines knitting is just more in your face, the clicking sound is irritating if you've paid good money to hear the show and strikes me as boarding on obnoxious. \n\n\nIf someone has anxiety then it is up to them to manage it in an unobtrusive way as possible per the event they are attending and their needs do not beat out everyone else's that is attending the gig - an amicable balance should be sought taking as much into account as possible but ultimately distractions to others should be a no. \n\n\nAlso the anxiety point was just speculation as to why this person was knitting and from what I read they just got irritated at the note and went off in a huff.

It's not a thing we do.", "Cinemas in some other countries I've been to are *genuinely loud*...nobody cares about those places, though. Just hate on America, why don't we?", "Europeans have no sense of humor, so they don't laugh in movies.", "It'll come, if you want it to. Try getting into a good 'zone' with a row of knitting - peaceful and calm at home, no distractions, and maybe just a row of Knit stitches. Then just close your eyes as you're looking at your needles. Like, a long blink. Then check what it looks like. It takes time, but if you want to do it, give it a try. :)", "I can tell you are based on your response.", "Well, now that I've been educated a little - watch out for any scene involving juggling - might wind up with too many balls in the air!", "And the streets weren't even made of cheese!\n\nWhat bs is that?!?!", "I\u2019m a horror fiend and I enjoy people gasping/nervous laughing/occasionally screaming in the theater. That\u2019s part of why I go\u2014being in a room full of people sharing this emotional experience is really fun to me!", "Thank you \ud83d\ude02 But I\u2019m now motivated to up my knitting game to reach all you lot with your fancy I-don\u2019t-need-to-see-to-knit skills. Wish me luck.", "I'm wishing you luck! Honestly, it's just practice. I've been knitting for decades, and I'm able to hold a full conversation and watch a TV programme in the dark-ish and also knit. Sometimes, however, when the light goes back on, I look at what I've knitted and go \"wtaf?\" and had to undo it, buuuut, the point stands. I can knit in the dark! It just sometimes looks like shit! xD\n\nSeriously, take your knitting everywhere with you and get knitting when you're doing other things like: 10 min break at work, do a couple of rows; sitting as a passenger in a car? Few rows or even a half, doesn't matter; on the bus? Go at it. Occasionally, you might have to say, \"Just a sec while I count,\" but that's okay. \n\n\nJust be mindful that what you knit as you're chatting away with someone may not end up the best you can do. And that's fine! After a bit, you'll look at your knitting and go \"WOW I didn't realise I'd done that much! AND it all looks right! Bonus!\"\n\nQuick edit: I have taught people to knit in the past, and the hardest bit to get them to do is to 'feel' the needles and yarn as they're going along. If you're knitting and looking at your needles, get in the zone and then just close your eyes for a stitch or two, then stop and look at what you did. After a bit of that, you'll be doing more and more. Good luck, genuinely.\n\nGNU Sir Terry.", "It's like typing, you do it enough you can automatically feel when you make a mistake", "Try continental knitting. You'd be surprised how just feeling the stitch makes it so much easier."]}
