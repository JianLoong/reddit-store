The problem isn't your keeping or returning the time off that you booked; it's that your office has multiple times tried to make you cancel on time off because *they* insist on running with a staff so small that it can't accommodate its employees actually taking the time off that's part of their compensation. \n\nThey're trying to make it your problem, but they could simply give you *and* the Eid celebrants the day off. If they don't have the staff to do that, they could hire temp staff for the purpose, or simply recognize that having to ask you multiple times over a year to give up on already-booked time off shows that they don't have enough *permanent* staff, and hire someone else in the role so that there's plenty of overlap among all of your duties and everyone can take their time off at a reasonable pace. \n\nPaid vacation time isn't always offered with a job. But when it is, it's not a gift. It's part of your paycheck, and that makes it a normal part of doing business. A company which can't afford to allow its employees the use of the time off which is in their negotiated compensation package cannot afford to do business at all, and should shut down... just like a company which can't afford to pay its employees the wages that were negotiated as part of their compensation package can't afford to do business at all, and needs to shut down. There's no difference.", "NTA. Not everyone gets their religious holidays off. I have had to work Christmas.

The date of date of Eid isn't set until the prior month, so OP could schedule a lot further in advance.\n\nThat said, the *actual* date of Eid has fallen on the *predicted* date 85% of the time in the last twenty years, and one could very likely be perfectly safe by asking for time off the day after too. One could always give back the other day once the correct date for Eid is determined.

It's not your fault or your problem that they approves too many people for the same day. However, check your work calendar and see what holidays you're given off. If there is one that's a little less needed, if that makes sense?, you could suggest that wprk replaces that holiday with one of the Eid days since they have so many Muslim employees. Eid changes when it shows up unlike a lot of other holidays but your employer has a problem with too many people asking for the same day off and it could be a solution in the future. \n\nHappy early birthday!

Turkey apparently just uses astronomical calculations, where other countries wait for actual sightings, and others wait till their religious leaders announce it. All very confusing to me as someone who doesn't celebrate it how we can't all agree on a method", ">the true asshole is the employer for understaffing to the point where this is a problem. \n\nI disagree, because it's a religious holiday, not a general staffing issue. If a certain percentage of your staff is a member of a religion, and there's no national holiday on that day (like there is for Christmas in the US), you're going to have a problem with people wanting their holiday off.  I don't think anyone would recommend hiring discrimination on the basis of religion.\n\nThere's no way to address  it by increased staffing, without having tons too many people than are needed on non-holidays.", "Ah, weird shortening, then.", "No good!
