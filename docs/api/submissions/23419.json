You offered the bathroom. That includes #1 and #2. \n\nThe fact that he said he needed to go #2 means he probably really needed to use it. And you'd already offered by this point. \n\nImagine you're in his shoes. Youre bringing in boxes at somebody's place and need to use a bathroom that is steps away. Instead, you're told to get back in your car and drive a mile down the road. \n\nAlso, for what it's worth, this is no way to end up with a job well done.", "YTA only because you basically said yes then backtracked on it. If you were reluctant just say no! If you feel awkward say it's broke and you're waiting on a plumber but the nearest publicly available toilet is X.", "Were these deliverymen installing something?  If so, the norm is to treat them like you would a contractor, which is to allow bathroom usage. \nBut particularly because you allowed it, then retracted the permission, YTA.", "YTA.  He is a human.  He needed to urgently use a bathroom.  You had a bathroom.  Of course, he was irritable.  He was trying not to shit himself while hauling around his delivery.  You are lucky they didn't leave to use the restroom.\n\nYour logic sucks too.  The body waste was in your house for longer.  If he had used the toilet, it would have been flushed out the house and you would not be the asshole.", "YTA. People poop. It\u2019s a natural bodily function. It\u2019s not some great act of intimacy to poop in a toilet.", "YTA, only cuz you at first allowed it and then told him no when you found out he was pooping. it doesn\u2019t matter if it was urinating or defecating. everyone universally has to use a bathroom. best not to police people\u2019s bodily functions. That\u2019s just weird.", "It's kind of dick move to suddenly disallow the use of your bathroom upon learning he's going to take a shit. If that makes you so uncomfortable you should have been upfront about it or just not let him use it in the first place. YTA", "How do you not see that you\u2019re a massive A hole. \n\nYTA", "NAH.

Delivery workers are humans, doing a service for you. They're not machines. All of this is a bodily need that usually can't be put off, so let people use your bathroom. It's a pretty basic respect thing.", "YTA", "NTA. It's understandable to feel uncomfortable about a stranger using your bathroom for more than #1, especially if you had a negative past experience with it. You have the right to set boundaries in your own home.\n\n On the other hand, the deliveryman might have been in a tough spot, but it's not unreasonable for you to prioritize your comfort and safety", "NTA.
