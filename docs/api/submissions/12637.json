I am a regular customer at a small, local day spa in my neighborhood. Not super fancy, but a nice place with friendly, talented folks and a chill neighborhood vibe. I go in every few weeks for some treatment or another usually on a Friday after work or a Saturday. Until yesterday I had never met the \"back office\" owner (some of the aestheticians are part owners and the stylist rents her chair). She came out while a lovely woman we'll call M was doing a mani-pedi (glorious). She immediately started asking M why she hadn't been able to sell me gels (I don't like them) and why she wasn't talking to me more (we do make some small talk, but normally I enjoy the opportunity to just let the chatter of the place flow over me and not talk). The thing is, I probably wasn't expected to understand what she was saying because she was speaking Japanese (my husband is Japanese so I'm able to follow conversation but I'm not fluent). Still, after owner lady paused for breath I asked M about her son and we chatted for the rest of the service.\n\nWhen M checked me out I went to hand her the normal tip amount in cash, which she preferred and the owner lady came over in what I felt was a very rude manner. And said (roughly) I should get a cut of that since you were obviously more focused on getting your tip than making sure the business gets paid. Then she tried to grab the tip OUT OF MY HAND. All my relaxy chill was completely gone and I said something to the effect of take your hands off of me. This isn't yours. M is doing the work and she and [named others] are why people come here. I spend $X a month here in f-ing service fees I don't need upselling I need some f-ing peace and quiet. She got very red and went back to the back. She looked very upset. I didn't raise my voice. I don't think anyone could have heard me beyond M and the nail tech who was sorting colors at her table right behind reception.\n\nStill, I feel bad for snapping and swearing. I don't want to it to be awkward next time I go in. I do really love the professionals who work there.

You used your words, and quite effectively apparently. Now you know why she prefers her tips in cash, the owner probably takes 60% of the tips on the card.", "NTA, you\u2019re paying for a service and watching your tech be spoken to so rudely ruined your time. Also she\u2019s a bad business owner if she micromanaging, the people who work with the customers know what regulars want. The owner came out in an accusatory fashion. \n\nI would check on the nail tech and see if she was okay after. \n\nHonestly I think you were respectful, her behavior was embarrassing.", "NTA - she was on a power trip and needed a foot in the ass. I would worry about how she treated M afterward though. That owner definitely took your reaction out on someone later.", "NTA - I mean... it would have been better to make your point without swearing, but...I can't say I'd have reacted much better if someone tried to take the money right out of my hand. Now that it's over, I'd just let it go. I wouldn't apologize.", "Nta sounds like the typical owner profiting off of the backs of their abused employees.", "NTA. Sounds like  the owner lady doesn't care about her empl\u00f6yee or the customers. Interrupting a spa treatment to call the employee out, trying to sell stuff to regular costumers ust to make more profit. Yes that is a known business strategy of spas but I hate those.\n\nYou were absolutly right to snap at this person.", "NTA hopefully she was red with shame after being caught behaving so badly and will think twice before she treats her employees like that again. But unfortunately I doubt it. In an ideal world you probably shouldn\u2019t have sworn at her but she was being outrageously rude so understandable that you weren\u2019t perfectly measured in your response. I don\u2019t think you owe her an apology.", "NTA, you probably said what the workers wish they could. Please continue going and advocating for the workers!! I'd be willing to bet they love it", "NTA. You\u2019re probably customer of the millennium now that you stood up to that tyrant. Some people need to be picked up and put in their place. The boss was way out of line and if she talks to them like that in front of customers can you imagine how she speaks to them when no one is around.", "NTA.", "NTA That woman needed to hear it from you, the customer. The women working there have probably been thinking this for months or years.", "No big, but maybe apologize for cussing at the lady the next time you go in. Your point is dead on, but cussing at her wasn\u2019t a respectful way to get your point across. \nThat lady shouldn\u2019t have taken anything from your hand nor should she have had her words with M in front of you. She should be embarrassed by her behavior. You can\u2019t control her actions. But you can control yours. \nA quick apology for the cussing, then let the ordeal roll off your back. Honestly, they\u2019d prob be happy to act like it never happen.", "NTA good for you", "NTA. She ruined your relaxed buzz.

No wonder they prefer tips in cash!", "Well, looks like the day spa is in desperate need of a tip jar and a lesson in transparency.", "Yes, good point. I will definitely call M tomorrow to make my next appointment and check in on her.", "Hmmm. Good point. I think her job would be safe (her sister is one of the aestheticians who is a part owner and her MIL provides the *extremely* popular waxing service). But I'll definitely call her tomorrow to schedule another appointment and see if she's okay.", "Or, when she asked about M\u2019s son, should have spoken in Japanese and let the owner know she understood her.", "Seen it done and called administrative fees. Prefer cash as it is certain where going.", "I always give my tips in cash even if I pay my bill with a credit  card.", "If you've been a client of M for a length of time you may see if they want to discretely exchange cell phone numbers with you. In many places service providers move around, not always by choice. This way you could find their new workplace.\n\nThat's how I stayed with my manicurist for 11 years before i moved out of state.", "NTA and I personally hate when salons upsell because the one time I let them do it to me I ended up with nails I HATED", "NTA  \nThank you for paying the tech's tip in cash.  Sounds like the owner is ripping off people who get their tip added to their card.", "NTA. what you witnessed was workplace abuse, and good on you for refusing to let it be normalized.", "It could also be so that they don\u2019t have to report the tips.", "I try to do cash bc as I have always understood it, the card companies take a percent of charges, which includes your tip. So reducing the tip by doing it that way.", "Very illegal in the US, not sure about other countries though.", "NTA. \n\nSometimes people need a dramatic reaction to realize how rude they are.", "NTA !! You stood up for the employees and gave the owner a well needed talking to. Good for you! And the employees", "NTA. Youre a good person for speaking up and not accepting the shitty treatment of her employees.", "NTA OP.  I would have done the same thing.", "NTA. \n\nShe thinks that just because she is speaking a different language and the general population won\u2019t understand, that it\u2019s ok to berate her employee IN FRONT of her client. Can you imagine someone doing that in front of you in English?  It typically would not fly anywhere. \n\nShe was extremely rude to your aesthetician and to you. She interrupted your relaxing experience and distracted your aesthetician during your service.  I understand why the last straw was her grabbing the tip from your hand. Most people would not remain calm in that situation.  \n\nQuestion though - did you tell her that in English or in Japanese?  \n\nIf it was in English, you could refrain from directly letting her know you understand Japanese - that way you will still hear all the rude things she\u2019s saying if you want. OR you could tell her you understand, and maybe she will leave you alone when you come in. I doubt she would be so brazen if she knew you understood her.", "I've been going to the same hair professional 4-5 times a year for 16 years. My appointment is always early Saturday morning -- because that's before all the hens come in and the place becomes a cacophany of mindless babble. My stylist knows that I like to relax and have peace and quiet, and we don't usually converse much (we do talk enough for her to know about my job and my trips and hobbies and occasional surgeries). I love it. And she says she appreciates getting a break from having to always be \"on\" socially, because all of her other clients expect the endless chatter.\n\nYou are right to make it clear to the owner that you don't appreciate unnecessary conversation, and that M is quiet because you prefer it that way, not because she's incompetent.\n\nAlso, the owner has now realized that you understand Japanese, so hopefully she won't try pulling this crap again.", "It doesn't reduce the tip. The owner is required to give tips to ripped employees.", "I believe this depends. Is the worked an employee or independent contractor? If employee, are they being paid as a tipped worker or standard minimum wage worker? If tipped, it is illegal, if not not tipped then the business can claim sum or all of the tips. It is dirty, underhanded and deceitful to the customer but the business can if they are paying employees as non-tipped workers. \n\nIf they are independent contractors, then it 100% depends on the contract they have with the salon. They may have an agreement that says the salon gets x% of their income as chair rent. In this case income includes tips."]}
