We have not always had a good relationship due to him being an alcoholic while I was growing up (he has been sober for nearly a year now). I cut him off when I turned 18 and moved out but we reconciled and have been working on our relationship for the past 2 months. \r  \n\r  \nDuring a conversation about my future plans, I mentioned my career goals and was explaining what university classes I was currently enrolled in when he cut me off and said, \u201cWomen belong in the kitchen, not chasing some dream job\u201d and laughed. I was taken aback by this. I asked If he was being serious, and he said \u201cNo need to get your knickers in a twist about it\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIn that moment, I couldn\u2019t contain my anger and frustration. I told him his comments were disrespectful and he shouldn\u2019t talk about women that way.

Now I'm feeling guilty and not sure if I should let this go, he's never expressed these views to me before so maybe it\u2019s a one time thing.

Your father is a huge asshole. Classic asshole move to say some deeply misogynistic shit and then pretend it's a joke when called out on it. Your father clearly doesn't respect women and doesn't even respect you. If he did, he at least would have been apologetic when you expressed your feelings.

You don't tolerate sexism, real or joking, that's \"just who you are\" and you will no longer be responding to anything regarding him.

That\u2019s just the type of bullshit people come out with when they get called out. IF it was just a joke and the relationship mattered that much to him, he\u2019d be reaching out and apologising to you himself, not getting family members to harass you into feeling guilty for standing up for yourself.

HE hurt YOU and he\u2019s not taking responsibility for it.

No matter any other judgement cast at him here, that one point is so amazing just to read.\n\nOnto my judgement: NTA. It is one thing to hold onto antiquated ideas, it is another to make a flippant comment to douse your child's enthusiasm over their potential future prospects. You may have expressed more ire in the moment than intended, but me thinks it may have been a combined release of some longstanding frustration/hurt due to being the child of a parent who makes some very poor life decisions. If he had only meant it as an ill-timed quip, he should have made that clear when you got riled up.

You've now set a boundary with him that you won't tolerate him disrespecting women or putting down your dreams; the true test is whether he respects this boundary or breaks it again.

It was a bad joke.  But you need to chill.  Also, you need to be aware of something.  The woman-loving movement (starts with f) is kind of a catch-22 situation for young ladies.  You don't need domestic skills, you don't need a husband, you don't need to be a housewife.  Go to school, get a degree, get a career.   OK.  Many young ladies take that literally as good advice.  So they spend their twenties in school and establishing a career.  Make something of themselves.  Feel wonderful.  Then in their 30s, they suddenly decide they want to do the whole married with children thing.  Now there's an issue.  All the guys who want to do the married with children thing are focused on chasing 20-something women who are not totally focused on career goals.\n\nIt's a raw deal for young ladies, as they have to decide which path they will choose around age 20 (roughly).  If you want the whole married with children thing, your best odds of finding a good husband are if you meet him in your early 20's and get married in your MID 20s\\*\\*\\*.  But that exactly corresponds to the time that many young ladies are mostly focused on education and launching a career.  \n\nYou can do the whole degree and career thing.  That is a valid choice.  You just need to be aware that if you aren't focused on marriage soon, then marriage might not be in the cards for this lifetime.  There are millions of women in their 30s who are trying to find a guy to lock into a lifetime thing now because they didn't even TRY to do that in their 20s.  And the universal complaint is \"Where are all the GOOD men?\".  They're out there.  But they are chasing the 20-somethings...\n\n\\*\\*\\*  Now someone will chime in and say she's been married for 20 years, has 3 children, and met her husband when she was 32.  Yup, there are a few out their who beat the odds.  But for the average lady in her 30s, finding a good husband is tough.  REALLY tough.  Don't take my word for it.

He said that when he got sober for good, it was because he figured out why he was drinking. Before that he just blamed everyone else for his problems. He realised he was drinking because he had a shitty childhood and bad coping skills and used alcohol to \"escape\" his problems. He couldn't change his past, and he couldn't fix his family, and when he was able to acknowledge that the bad things he did when he was drinking were ultimately his fault and no one else's, was he able to move past it.\n\nHe changed so much that my mother would refer to her \"first husband' when talking about those times.\n\nI think that OP's father is still thinking like a drunk.

Talking to them always dragged up the traumatic memories, and I somehow felt guilty for being a \"problem child\" (as they repeatedly called me growing up).\n\nAll of that would always set back all my growth progress in terms of moving past it all and becoming my own whole person.\n\nEver since I cut them out, I've felt so liberated. I'm no longer bound by my past. All my decisions, good and bad, are my own now.\n\nDrop him, OP. It will only get worse.\n\nEdit: NTA, obviously.", "Action, meet consequence. NTA.", "Wow, I'm sorry you have experienced so much pain in your life you feel the need to go that dark and aggressive so quickly. Kind of a low blow as that detail was capped off with his sobriety length, I hope you one day experience considering other perspectives and grow from it.", "When they say \"kitchen\" what they really mean is \"serving her lord and husband in every way that he sees fit\". The kitchen is just a symbol, but of course when it means a job, money and independence, they suddenly don't want women there.", "That's because the sentiment isn't actually about the kitchen, it's about servitude. They don't want you to spend energy on your things because it means you aren't spending energy on theirs.", "It's a woman's job when it's free labour. If there's pay involved, then it's a man's job and it's got prestige.", "> \u201cWomen belong in the kitchen!\u201d and yet most chefs and cooks are men. I guess most people who spout that nonsense rather handily forget that little tidbit of information since it conflicts with their worldview.\n\nNah, because that's not a Kitchen, its a Profession, which you know, mans place, not women's.", "It's about impressing people and prestige too.", "They probably think they're better than her and feel downright insulted to be forced to work with a woman who has the same rights as them in the workplace. Sad truth about some men is that they don't see women as their equals, let alone people.", "Yep. It was shocking to me at first that he would say that to his own daughter but nothing surprises me anymore. It took some therapy and mourning to get to where I am but I don\u2019t see him as a dad anymore. He\u2019ll never change and I\u2019m done trying to have any kind of relationship with him. I don\u2019t want a person like that around my daughter.", "Agreed. Making misogynistic remarks like to his daughter is not a mistake. \n\nAnd why is it the daughters job to teacher her father how to apologize or be careful how she confronts/holds boundaries? He\u2019s a grown ass man.", "I adjusted to just say \u201cdrop him.\u201d I got the saying from my dad, who\u2019s a Brazilian immigrant so it makes sense why I\u2019ve been using it incorrectly haha", "Jesus that's terrible,  so sorry.    I grew up with that bad stuff too.   Stay strong friend.", "Aaah. Of course. Makes perfect sense now you mention it. \n\nAnd if it\u2019s traditionally a masculine job or skill (like fixing cars) even if there\u2019s no pay involved some of them feel emasculated. I\u2019m very glad the guys at the garage I use don\u2019t feel that way - they seem to enjoy showing me how to do things and what they need to do if I ask.\n\nI hope they reply to tell me why they get intimidated by a female chef though lol.", "Amen!", "Yeah, someone else said something similar. Free labour = women\u2019s work.", "Thank you, you too. I was comparing the rhetoric used for \"oh just give him a chance and decide for yourself.\" \"Apples to oranges,\" my eye."]}
