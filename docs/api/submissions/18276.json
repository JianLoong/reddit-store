We have not always had a good relationship due to him being an alcoholic while I was growing up (he has been sober for nearly a year now).

I was taken aback by this. I asked If he was being serious, and he said \u201cNo need to get your knickers in a twist about it\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIn that moment, I couldn\u2019t contain my anger and frustration. I told him his comments were disrespectful and he shouldn\u2019t talk about women that way.

Now I'm feeling guilty and not sure if I should let this go, he's never expressed these views to me before so maybe it\u2019s a one time thing.

Your father is a huge asshole. Classic asshole move to say some deeply misogynistic shit and then pretend it's a joke when called out on it. Your father clearly doesn't respect women and doesn't even respect you. If he did, he at least would have been apologetic when you expressed your feelings.

It\u2019s not a joke and it\u2019s not funny. Go no contact again, because this will just be the first of many times he disrespects you and every single woman in your life.", "NTA. Let's pretend for a second that he was actually joking, he had the change to clarify that when you asked if he was serious and then apologize. Instead he mocked you for getting upset at his clearly sexist joke and doubled down.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Be careful with him, if he reaches out to genuinely apologize I'd be very careful accepting it.

No matter what, don't put your self worth into this mans hands, you'll just be crushed.", "NTA.

You don't tolerate sexism, real or joking, that's \"just who you are\" and you will no longer be responding to anything regarding him. He now needs to take on the traditional male role of being accountable for his actions.\n\nThen follow through and stop replying no matter how tempting.", "NTA. Dad wasn\u2019t joking. That\u2019s just the type of bullshit people come out with when they get called out. IF it was just a joke and the relationship mattered that much to him, he\u2019d be reaching out and apologising to you himself, not getting family members to harass you into feeling guilty for standing up for yourself.

You have the right to ask anyone to leave your home, and for any reason.\n\nIf your dad had been making a joke, he had multiple opportunities to explain and apologize. He did neither of those things.

HE hurt YOU and he\u2019s not taking responsibility for it.

No matter any other judgement cast at him here, that one point is so amazing just to read.\n\nOnto my judgement: NTA. It is one thing to hold onto antiquated ideas, it is another to make a flippant comment to douse your child's enthusiasm over their potential future prospects. You may have expressed more ire in the moment than intended, but me thinks it may have been a combined release of some longstanding frustration/hurt due to being the child of a parent who makes some very poor life decisions. If he had only meant it as an ill-timed quip, he should have made that clear when you got riled up. He's doing damage control with family to get his narrative out ASAP so people side with him, it sounds like.

Additionally, if your dad genuinely WANTS to apologise, and make up for it, he could have done so that night, or reached out himself since.

It was a bad joke.  But you need to chill.  Also, you need to be aware of something.  The woman-loving movement (starts with f) is kind of a catch-22 situation for young ladies.  You don't need domestic skills, you don't need a husband, you don't need to be a housewife.  Go to school, get a degree, get a career.   OK.  Many young ladies take that literally as good advice.  So they spend their twenties in school and establishing a career.  Make something of themselves.  Feel wonderful.  Then in their 30s, they suddenly decide they want to do the whole married with children thing.  Now there's an issue.  All the guys who want to do the married with children thing are focused on chasing 20-something women who are not totally focused on career goals.\n\nIt's a raw deal for young ladies, as they have to decide which path they will choose around age 20 (roughly).  If you want the whole married with children thing, your best odds of finding a good husband are if you meet him in your early 20's and get married in your MID 20s\\*\\*\\*.  But that exactly corresponds to the time that many young ladies are mostly focused on education and launching a career.  \n\nYou can do the whole degree and career thing.  That is a valid choice.  You just need to be aware that if you aren't focused on marriage soon, then marriage might not be in the cards for this lifetime.  There are millions of women in their 30s who are trying to find a guy to lock into a lifetime thing now because they didn't even TRY to do that in their 20s.  And the universal complaint is \"Where are all the GOOD men?\".  They're out there.  But they are chasing the 20-somethings...\n\n\\*\\*\\*  Now someone will chime in and say she's been married for 20 years, has 3 children, and met her husband when she was 32.  Yup, there are a few out their who beat the odds.  But for the average lady in her 30s, finding a good husband is tough.  REALLY tough.  Don't take my word for it.

He said that when he got sober for good, it was because he figured out why he was drinking. Before that he just blamed everyone else for his problems. He realised he was drinking because he had a shitty childhood and bad coping skills and used alcohol to \"escape\" his problems. He couldn't change his past, and he couldn't fix his family, and when he was able to acknowledge that the bad things he did when he was drinking were ultimately his fault and no one else's, was he able to move past it.\n\nHe changed so much that my mother would refer to her \"first husband' when talking about those times.\n\nI think that OP's father is still thinking like a drunk. You didn't like what I said and you cut me off? Not my fault, let me just go find an enabler to make you see how it's your fault, not mine.\n\nHe also gave me the best advice about drinking. If you think you need a drink. You don't need a drink. If you have drinks with dinner with friends, and even get drunk, that doesn't make you an alcoholic.
