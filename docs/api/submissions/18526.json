Your parents are out of touch with the reality of what used to be a friendship. \n\nYou had not contact for 10 years, why invite and attend now?", "NTA. You politely declined the invite. You are not required to go to a wedding just because you were invited.", "NTA - You are better than me because I would have left that invite on read. After all, what's a little ghosting between \"friends\"?", "Did you consider that sending the wedding invite (and the effort to track down your contact info) was her trying to rekindle the friendship?", "NTA but your parents are.", "NTA. It's a wedding invite, not a court summons. You worded it, *perhaps* a little curtly but you certainly weren't rude in any way.\n\nThe parents need to butt out too, it's none of your parents business.", "NTA. Sorry about those parents you have.", "NTA - You should have mentioned that your parents aren\u2019t welcome at your wedding if that\u2019s how they feel.", "NTA\n\nYour parents don't decide who you are friends with. Tell them to back off.", "~~ESH but you're the least AH imo.~~ (See my edit below)\n\nYour former friend sucks b/c they ghosted you then didn't talk to you until their wedding, which is very self-focused.\n\nYour parents are being ridiculous demanding you go and insulting you.\n\nI'd say you should have either made up an excuse not to go (can't attend) or been honest about why you declined, the \"I decline\" without explanation was bound to lead to more questions.  But you're least AH of everyone here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT - Upon reflection i revise my point to NTA for you.  Everyone else sucks.  I still think it was not a smart choice to decline the way you did b/c it was bound to lead to more drama, but it wasn't particularly AH behavior.", "Exactly!!!! As this sun is fond of saying, it\u2019s an invitation not a summons.", "Tbh, no. And even if it was, I\u2019m not interested", "What effort to track down contact info? M's mom and OP's parents were clearly still in contact. So all M had to do was get OP's details that way. It's not like it was a hunt for a long lost person because there was still a connection in place.", "Why do they have to make an excuse? The former friend ghosted her 10 years ago what do they look like going to said friends wedding \ud83d\udc80", "> not a smart choice to decline the way you did\n\nHow would you have declined it? I thought the way OP did it was pretty flawless. \n\n>dear m, I am declining the invitation to attend your wedding. I wish you the best.\n\nNothing wrong with that.", "You're right.  Revised my point to NTA.", "They've said in their comment that they would decline by either making up an excuse of being honest. Rather than not providing any reasoning whatsoever.", "Nta\nMom and dad on the other hand....", "NTA ---  it's an invitation, not a summons and your right not to accept if you don't want too", "NTA do your parents actually like you at all? Dayum", "NTA to be honest m, it doesn\u2019t sound like a genuine invite. Maybe both parents discussed it and forced her to invite you.", "NTA. If her parents are friends with yours and if they are remotely similar in thinking, I bet the only reason you got an invite after 10 years of no contact was at the pressure of her parents. If she wanted to rekindle the friendship, an apology would have been the start of that process, not an invite to her wedding out of the blue.", "NTA. You have every right to decline an invitation whatever your reasons are. I don't get why parents need to be so pushy with attending weddings. \n\nSince your friend ghosted you, you can't spoken for 10 years, i don't see a reason for you to go or forced to go.", "NTA. Maybe it is time to go LC with your parents, if they tend to put you down like this. At least until the time they figure out what is wrong with their response.", "nta but your parents sound like A@#$#", "NAH. Sounds like they are worried about you, not being malicious", "NTA. You RSVP'd (many would have not bothered) and politely declined (an invite is not an order). I have declined wedding invitations before simply because I could not be bothered to attend.", "NTA, and honestly, M probably only invited you to shut her own mother up. You did nothing wrong, and your parents need to sfu.", "Wtf is wrong with your parents?", "NTA but your parents sure are.\u2018who says that to someone they claim to love SMH.", "NTA x a million. Lifes too short to deal with people we dont like/need to", "NTA, and why the heck are your parents so critical of you? They are just straight up a-holes in the way they blame you for the friendship ending (when you were actually ghosted) and then dunk on you for being single! They better start watching their mouths before you go low- or no-contact with them.", "NTA. Your parents are the assholes for disregarding your own thoughts on the matter. There was nothing wrong with how you declined the invitation", "NTA, but your parents are", "Are you an adult? If so, then why are you listening to your parents nonsense about this? You have no reason to go to the wedding.", "NTA. You were polite, direct and honest in your reply and establishing your boundaries. Your parents on the other hand, need to learn to butt out of business that is not theirs. Not to mention controlling/ manipulative. Notice how they used insults on personal aspects of your life because you wouldn\u2019t do what they wanted. I\u2019m more concerned that this is a pattern you may not have noticed before.", "Nta. You're obviously an adult and can decide who you want in your life. That includes your parents who you should be setting some serious boundaries with by the way.", "NTA You aren't friends anymore a random wedding invitation after years of not talking is a bit strange. If she wanted to be friends, missed you then she should of messaged you before she was even thinking about invites.", "Your message was brief, to the point and polite NTA", "You had not contact for 10 years, why invite and attend now?", "Or, give her the benefit of the doubt, and say that the bride's family potentially forced the bride into inviting her. \n\nTheir parents are still friendly. They were super friendly growing up. This is totally something my mom would have done to me. \n\nPerhaps I'm being overly generous here.\n\nIn either case, totally NTA. \n\nThe email decline was just fine.  Wishing someone happiness is in I believe nicer than saying congratulations.", "10/10", ">You worded it, perhaps a little curtly \n\nYep, the wording would in my opinion be rude for a friend or relative you're in touch with. But it's fine for someone who ghosted you and you haven't spoken to in ten years."]}
