M's mom and OP's parents were clearly still in contact. So all M had to do was get OP's details that way.

The former friend ghosted her 10 years ago what do they look like going to said friends wedding \ud83d\udc80", "> not a smart choice to decline the way you did\n\nHow would you have declined it? I thought the way OP did it was pretty flawless. \n\n>dear m, I am declining the invitation to attend your wedding. I wish you the best.\n\nNothing wrong with that.", "You're right.  Revised my point to NTA.", "They've said in their comment that they would decline by either making up an excuse of being honest. Rather than not providing any reasoning whatsoever."]}
