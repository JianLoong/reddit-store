The only reason why you'd be unhappy about this is if you wanted free pass to lie to her face about conversations that you're having around her, or just the ability to shit talk about her to your friends/relatives without her understanding. \n\nYTA because it seems that you're angry about the fact that you can no longer shit talk around her rather than the fact that you didn't know about this hobby of hers.", "Did you ever ask her if she spoke another language? Why does she have disclose every language she partly speaks to you \n\nYTA for overreacting. It seems super suspicious that you get triggers by this, are you trying to hide things from her and worry she will find out", "YTA if she speaks 13 languages,  how big a deal is it, in her world,  that she speaks Greek?\n\nTo her it is akin to where she vacationed as a child. Part of who she is.\n\nI think you this is actually about you not working hard enough to learn about your partner.  Have you asked her about her hobbies and interests?", "YTA. \n\n>Sometimes we'd slide in a few words\n\n>I was saying pretty basic things with my cousin\n\nSo you were deliberately excluding her from your conversation, thinking she didn't speak Greek. That is just rude as heck. You should be thankful she came forward and let you know before you went beyond saying *basic things.*", "YTA\u2026 for your unintentional lack of foresight. There's this unspoken rule wherein we don't speak another language in front of other people so that they don't feel excluded. Especially if they are our friends. Also why would you talk to your mother about her health, a topic which she's not comfortable talking about in the presence of people that are not her family? Couldn't you have waited until the two of you are alone?", "NAH  \n\n\nIt probably got a bit weird at some point when she realised you were speaking Greek fluently and she didn\u2019t know how to say \u201cHey! I speak that\u201d but then found a casual low impact way to bridge the now obvious gap.   \n\n\nHow did you have a girlfriend for six months and not know enough about her hobbies to know she spoke THIRTEEN LANGUAGES FLUENTLY?", "13 languages? You sure she doesn\u2019t work for the CIA?? I\u2019d be too impressed to care.", "The fact that you don't know she speaks 13!!! Languages fluently is a sign that you are not so interested in getting to know her.\nIf you would have asked what are you interested in ore what are your hobbies  am sure you wouId have known.", "YTA. The only reason I can think of for you to be angry over this is because you purposefully wanted to say things in front of her that she wouldn\u2019t understand, which begs the question \u2014 why would you want to be so rude and non-inclusive of your girlfriend?", "NAH, because honestly there's a lot that may not come up naturally in just six months but I understand you're upset at accidentally disclosing your mother's private medical information. \n\nImo, she probably heard bits and pieces over the phone, understood that it was a private conversation, and didn't bring up what was said with you because she knew it was none of her business. Pretending you didn't hear private information is a very common social expectation in my experience, and it is seen as a courtesy. \n\nYou never tried to talk to her in Greek, you never spoke with someone in a situation where she could reasonably join in (interrupting phone calls is rude), and now that she had the opportunity for the first time she did join in naturally. \n\nAlternatively, it's quite possible that she has had men judge her in the past and didn't want to bring it up because of that. Many men are unfortunately intimidated by women having talents, especially talents that give one high social standing, like speaking 13 languages. And when you have a hobby like that, it is easy for other people to misinterpret you as being a braggart when you're just trying to talk about something you like and that is important to you. \n\nI personally had a hobby that was misinterpreted by others, although along a different axis, and I got into the habit of keeping it totally to myself as a method of self-protection. It was something very important to me, but also something I saw as completely separate from other people -- a hobby I could only enjoy in isolation. \n\nIf you continue holding this against her, YWBTA, but some kneejerk bad feelings due to being caught unawares is I think understandable.", "Yta, have you ever once asked her what her hobbies or interests are?", "YTA for expecting to be able to have secret conversations around your girlfriend and being upset that she can understand them. Doing that is super rude anyway.", "YTA, and she probably assumed you knew already. I mean, you are speaking in a \"foreign\" language with your gf right there and didnt bother to translate. So from her point you are either 1) incredibly rude and inconsiderate to your partner or 2) know she at least understands a bit of what youre saying right in front of her.\n\napparently you **never** said \"sorry, i was just saying (in Greek) that...\" to which she could have answered \"dont worry, im really good in Greek myself\"", "YTA. \n\nWhy is this offensive in any way? And if you thought she couldn't speak Greek, why were you speaking it (even basic words) with your cousin while the three of you were together? I think not mentioning you speak a language is less rude than excluding someone in the room from a conversation.", "If she\u2019s speaks 13 languages the fact that you speak another language probably felt inconsequential in her head. Also idk about all languages but if you speaking one of many Latin languages she probably just didn\u2019t register it.", "Yta. Sure it could be weird that you don\u2019t know but it\u2019s as weird that you don\u2019t know about her hobbie and how many languages she speaks to as much as she\u2019s not told you she speaks Greek. You\u2019ve never asked her about her hobbie\u2026. 13 languages\u2026 she\u2019s clearly been respectful when understanding conversations she wasn\u2019t ment to. She\u2019s not mentioned she can understand the conversations about ur mums health coz it\u2019s personal and you didn\u2019t want her hearing it. She dosnt even say she can understand so obviously wouldn\u2019t divulge any information. She\u2019s not used her secretly knowing Greek to spy or anything so what\u2019s the issue. Sure it\u2019s weird to not know but to start a argument with when she\u2019s not actualy caused any damage or harm or done anything wrong. Is a ass move", "YTA your own assumption so it is in you. Start feeling proud of your girlfriend...believe me she will appreciate that a lotttttt more.", "YTA and it seems like you haven\u2019t really got to know each other very well \n\nIt\u2019s rude to have private conversations literally in front of someone. What were you saying in front of her that you didn\u2019t want her to know?", "YTA for sure and I\u2019d like to meet a person like her.", "13 languages?!?! Holy shit that's hot. I want to date her.", "YTA.  It seems to me that you are still in the getting to know you phase of your relationship.  Now you know she speaks Greek!  13 languages is amazing!  I'm guessing you never asked her what languages she speaks or about all of her hobbies.", "YTA because you just assumed she wouldn't understand. It's not her fault that she did. This reminds me of those articles of tourists talking shit in their native language, assuming people don't understand, and then getting caught and embarrassed.", "YTA. Surely you would be happy she spoke Greek? But instead of treating it like a moment for celebration you act as if you've lost some sort of power over her. \n\nAlso, never assume that people can't understand you while speaking in front of them, whatever language you're using. That's a really naive way to go about life.", "YTA in any of the 13 languages she speaks, and others she doesn't. Why does she have to tell you what languages she speaks? Why do you feel you have to call her out? If there are conversations you don't want others to hear have them in private.  I would say it is ruder  to have conversations in a language you think someone  doesn't understand while they are there. Grow up or move on", "YTA, because major world languages aren\u2019t secret code. There\u2019s nothing wrong with saying something in Greek to your mother in front of your girlfriend, but assuming you are speaking in secret is ridiculous, and rude.", "Hold on. She\u2019s fluent in 13 languages? \u2014Not proficient. Fluent. Does anyone else find that hard to believe?", "YTA\n\nAs an immigrant myself, I learned early that you can NEVER assume that others don\u2019t understand you, regardless where/which language. Rookie mistake, but now you know. \n\nYou should actually marvel at the fact that your gf speaks 13 different languages. But it\u2019s weird that you \u201emade her count\u201c.", "YTA. Why aren\u2019t you getting to know her and asking her things about herself? Being long time acquaintances at work meant you had a long time and likely multiple opportunities to get to know her prior, and now 6 months together? If I were your gf I wouldn\u2019t be particularly thrilled with you as partner due to lacking interest in getting to know me well.", "NAH \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been in this situation, but I don\u2019t think it was rude of OP to have convos in Greek while her GF is in the room and assume she doesn\u2019t understand. My ex was from India and would often speak to his parents in the phone in Hindi while I was in the room. Because of time difference and the size of his apartment we weren\u2019t left with a lot of privacy for these conversations. He\u2019d fill me in on some things, but I also didn\u2019t feel the need to pressure info out that he wasn\u2019t comfortable sharing. \n\nIt is really weird for the GF to hear OP frequently speaking Greek in front of her and not say \u201chey I speak Greek too!\u201d Not even to warn her that she understands but just pointing out something they share. Definitely comes across like she was hiding it or something. \n\nOP also could have warned her, \u201chey I\u2019m speaking with my mom and Greek is the best way for us to do this. Also some of the information is things my mom would like to keep between just her and I.  just so you know but it\u2019s nothing about you or anything lol\u201d which could have easily opened the door to that convo too.\n\nETA typo", "I say ESH..\n\nGf is a soft A for not sharing this info. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s super important to know but it is strange that she knows you speak Greek and never thought of telling you. Maybe because she grew speaking 13 languages, she feels that it\u2019s normal but still. Or maybe she thought you already knew. Either way, she\u2019s less at fault here.\n\nYTA for reacting the way you did. I understand you were blindsided in a way, you weren\u2019t expecting her to know your language but you reacted as if she cheated on you. If you speak to someone about something private next to someone else, don\u2019t just assume that this person doesn\u2019t understand you and don\u2019t get angry at them once you realize they do. That\u2019s on you.\n\nApologize to your gf if you want to salvage this relationship and tell her that you were just not expecting this. And if you want, do a questionnaire to avoid this kind of situations in the future.", "YTA. Languages outside of English are not an exclusive secret. You should be proud that she\u2019s fluent in so many languages. Never assume someone can\u2019t speak another language. If you wanted to have private conversations about your mother\u2019s health, those conversations can happen in PRIVATE, away from anyone within earshot.", "YTA, why are you speaking in front of her in different languages presuming she doesn\u2019t understand. Why not ask if she speaks any Greek? Why speak basic words when the three of you are hanging out? \n\nIf she actually didn\u2019t speak it, that\u2019s quite rude no? Unless your cousin speaks zero English and it was a matter of having to communicate in your language, then you\u2019re rude. Rude and assuming when actually she\u2019s brilliant. \n\nMost people would think fantastic, she can communicate with my family and wow she\u2019s incredible being able to speak 13 languages. But you take it like some deception because actually she\u2019s understood you trying to talk in front of her but not including her", "13 LANGUAGES :O your gf is my hero. \n\nIm tossing between nah and soft tiny yta. You are still getting to know each other and for some bringing up things like intelligence or wealth can be difficult subjects to broach, especially only 6 months in. She may not have wanted to appear bragging and deter you, maybe shes had partners or dates react negatively to her abilities in the past. Maybe sit down and find out how much of your mothers health she has heard and just ask her to keep it between you as its stuff your mother doesnt want getting out.", "YTA trying to have convos in your language, you\u2019re just mad she understood you.", "INFO: did you ask her since when she speaks Greek? I\u2019d be a bit weirded out if she spoke it before you met and she never mentioned it. But I also find it weird that it never came up that languages are her hobby, like how is that possible? Do you two not have conversations? \n\nIt is entirely possible that she learned it after meeting you and wanted to surprise you. It is also possible that she withheld the information to see how you speak about her when you think she won\u2019t understand. So I withhold judgement for now as her intentions matter. Hence the question when she learned it is crucial. \n\nI get your reaction, I would\u2019ve had the same. The Y T A crowds however focus (rightfully) how this didn\u2019t come up. I share the concern but would really like to know her side", "YTA for 'calling her out' after you discovered she spoke Greek. \n\nBut how have you been dating for 6 months and it never came up.

Not hard.\n\nKeep pinning blame on her and she won't be an issue hearing your conversations as she won't be around - you should be proud, impressed and complimenting her multi-language abilities and kick yourself for not seeing this as a great thing and your own fault for assuming.", "YTA Why would she need to volunteer this information? It apparently never came up nor did you ask. If you didn\u2019t care enough to ask, why would she need to tell\u2026", "this seems like a very trivial thing to be mad about considering she continued to respect your privacy even if she could understand it. \n\nfurthermore, i think you should be very happy that you found somebody who can speak the same language as you, speaking as an immigrant in a foreign country desperately seeking compatriots who I can speak my own language to.\n\nYTA", "Yeah. Yta. You just assume no one understands you. Def a you a problem. Ask next time.", "YTA\n\nI don't know why you are getting mad that she speaks your language. Why get mad about it?", "ESH - it's weird that she didn't mention that she spoke Greek since she has heard you have private conversations in Greek. It seems weird that she didn't think it was worth mentioning. But it's equally bizarre that you didn't know she also speaks a dozen other languages. She must be practicing very regularly with at least some of them. How have the two of you never discussed her hobbies enough for this to come up. \n\nIs it possible that she learned Greek as an ill-conceived but cute little surprise for you and then when you didn't find it cute she tried to brush the whole thing off to avoid pissing you off even more? It's the only way I can make sense of this unless she was trying to catch you talking about her in Greek or you are so self absorbed you never asked her about her interests.", "NAH or maybe NTA. If you were purposefully trying to get away with saying gross/nasty things in front of her by using greek YWBTA.\n\nIt's basically that you obviously use greek to have sensitive conversations with your mother/family. If she's worked that out she should let you know. I don't think it was intentional on her part though, she sounds great.", "YTA if you didnt want her to know about it you shouldnt have spoken about it in front of her. whether it was in a different language or not", "YTA\nWhat have you been talking about this entire time? How much do you know about her likes and hobbies, I wonder? Or did she share and you just weren\u2019t paying attention? This is massively weird. Unless she\u2019s a special agent or your relationship is just all about sex.", "YTA, maybe she wanted to surprise you with it. How someone can tell you they speak 13 languages and your next emotion isn\u2019t just pure awe is beyond me. At the end of the day, she speaks your language - *be happy*", "\"I made her count.\"\n\nYTA. Why are you trying to shame her? I hope she breaks up with you. Obviously she isn't going to tell you \"I HEARD YOUR PRIVATE CONVO\". She was waiting for you to let her in and talk about it on your own terms. You are too young for an adult relationship.", "YTA-you\u2019re the one who made the assumption here.", "YTA whatchu hiding that she needs to tell you all the languages she speaks/understands?", "Isn\u2019t it incredibly rude to converse in a different language with someone when you are with your SO/friends/colleagues? There are exceptions (like if you had to talk to someone who only speaks Spanish), but it seems you deliberately had multiple conversations in front of your gf assuming she didn\u2019t speak the language. That is not indicative of respectful behavior.\n\nI also suspect part of your resentment is because 1. your gf knows more languages than you and 2. you can no longer pull off conversations in front of her without her knowing what it was about. \n\nYTA.\n\nYTA.", "You really need to have a questionnaire form that potential girlfriends can fill out first, like hobbies, personal history, languages spoken, that sort of thing. That way, you'd never be taken by surprise by a girlfriend's accomplishments. \n\nOn the other hand, she may also think that speaking in another language in front of her in a way designed to exclude her and make her feel irrelevant is an AH move.\n\nYTA, I'm afraid.", "YTA, very obviously you don\u2019t know your gf lol", "When you found out she was fluent in 13 languages didn't you asked which one were they?", "YTA. \n\nIt have never come up before - so she'd never mentioned it before.

These types of things come up organically- like it did in this moment. You never asked her, why did she need to volunteer it? Your expectation of her communicating this to you is only bc you feel ashamed you didn\u2019t know and had what you felt were private conversations in front of her. She clearly recognized they were private and said nothing to not embarrass you. Had you never had those conversations in front of her and this moment happened you probably would have been amazed by her. Instead you are acting like a brat about it. Lucky you your girlfriend is freaking amazing bc she can speak 13 languages, instead your annoyed. Get over yourself.", "Both are lowkey TA. \n\nAfter six months and after a longer period where the two knew each others, not telling that she speaks Greek is not good and I can't think of a single reason why she avoided telling you. When I was trying to learn Portuguese I was jumping at every native speaker I could find to practise so I find weird that she didn't want to try practise Greek with you. \n\nOn the other hand, also you not knowing is a bit weird after all this time. Either she lied about it or you never directly asked her if she spoke other languages. And since she said learning languages is a hobby of her, you should have known that at some point in your relationship. \n\nSeems to me you guys should talk more about each other. \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac to your mother, in any case.", "YTA\n\nDid you ask her?

Especially if the health issues your mom is going through our particularly stressful, your girlfriend probably didn't want to add on to that stress by letting you know that you just exposed a bunch of your mom's medical history in front of her. So in reality, whenever you talk to your mom about her health, she probably tunes you guys out and ignores what you're saying out of courtesy and respect.\n\nOn the other hand, she could have told you over the last 6 months, but you also could have asked.

Hiding the fact you know 13 languages, one of them being a language your SO speaks, feels very invasive, as if she enjoyed being that mysterious person in the background thinking \"ha ha they don't know I understand them\".

The question that should be asked is \"why didn't she tell you that she knows Greek when she found out that you're Greek?\". She KNEW you are Greek, she knew you speak the language, and for some reason decided to keep the fact that she understands Greek to herself. A non suspicious person, and one who respects your privacy, would say \"oh I know Greek too!\" the second you tell them that you're Greek. ESPECIALLY if they're interested in you romantically. Aren't they supposed to share when something you have in common pops up? Your girlfriend must've noticed the private conversations you had with your mother, and the decent thing to do would be to mention it later on, and show interest in your mother's health, and the only reasons I can think of why she didn't do that are:\n1.

She doesn't care about your mother's health.\nI would say the 3rd reason would be that she respects your mother's privacy and doesn't want to make you uncomfortable by telling you she understood you all along, but a person who really respects you would say \"hey, I may have not told you that in the past, but I understand your conversations with your mother. I think you should know since your mother might not be comfortable with having these conversations next to me\".

And to be out with her and her cousin but having secret side conversations in another language is rude. \n\nI\u2019m bilingual, and I don\u2019t behave like this.", "GF should probably volunteer the information once she starts overhearing things she's obviously not meant to be aware of.\n\nIf it were me, it'd be an exciting thing to bond over, I don't know why she'd hide it.\n\nBut there's definitely a point where it's a lie of omission, something that's deliberately being kept secret even though it's relevant and important.", "op is mad because she thought she was having a private conversation when gf was able to overhear and understand everything she was saying.", "He's hiding his mother's health condition that she wants to keep private.", "OP found out she speaks 13 languages AFTER this incident.. she had no idea beforehand", "She could\u2019ve brought it up though. \n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m Greek.\u201d \u201cHey, I speak Greek!\u201d\n\nLiterally any time she could\u2019ve slid it in there.", ">It have never come up before - so she'd never mentioned it before. That's not weird.\n  \nIt's weird if OP is speaking Greek within earshot of her, she can understand, and she never brought up that she can understand (especially if he was talking to family about sensitive subjects like health).", "People speaking another language openly in front of people with the expectation that it\u2019s private because it\u2019s in another language frustrate me. Who knows who speaks what language? I doubt the GF is truly \u201cfluent\u201d in 13 languages (aka has a CEFR B2-level command of the language) but even if so that\u2019s pretty awesome and you won the GF jackpot. Travel will be so much cooler. \n\nAnyway, I think it\u2019s currently NAH territory but heading toward Y T A if you make it a big deal or keep \u201ccalling them out\u201d on having basic skills. And stop pretending a common language spoken by millions of people is a private secret code language!", "> did she need to hand you her resume? These types of things come up organically\n\nI find hard to believe that a couple six months in a relationship never talk about it. Especially since the girlfriend apparently learns languages as a hobby.", "When you hear somebody at the bus stop having a personal conversation on the phone in English, do you tap them on the shoulder and say \u201cexcuse me\u2026 just so you know, I speak English and can understand you\u201d or do you just politely ignore their discussion and mind your own business? Furthermore, when they hang up the phone, do you ask them: \u201cMay I practice my English with you?\u201d Why would you do that if you are fluent in it?", "Fucking mental, right? NTA.", "Even when my husband was fluent in Chinese and Japanese he never told anyone.", "If she's fluent in thirteen languages, why is she hiding that fact?", "Instead you are acting like a brat about it.", "Well at the same time, why after 6 months is he just now finally realizing what her hobbies are? Did he not think to ask her about her hobbies over the last 6 months? Why does she have to be the only one to offer up information? Can he not also inquire?\n\nIn my opinion it's NAH. Given that he never asked, it's not necessarily unreasonable to expect that she wouldn't just offer up that she speaks 13 languages. That can kind of come off as your bragging, or that you're trying to one up someone, so I can see why she wouldn't necessarily bring it up unless it's addressed first.", "Sorry but, NSH? YTH?", "I think it\u2019s a bit odd that she didn\u2019t mention she spoke Greek after overhearing it but it doesn\u2019t seem malicious. If she was hiding it for some reason she never would have let OP know. Sounds to me with so many languages that the girlfriend just finds it second nature. Probably could have inferred a switch of language was for privacy so I can see why OP is upset- also would go Y T A if he was rude about it- that info seems missing/light. \n\nNot sure how such a talent and interest in languages would stay hidden for 6 months.", "Definitely something I would have thought someone would share. Understandable not a first because I guess it could seem imposing (I was like \ud83d\ude33 just reading she can). But six months down the line? That\u2019s a big part of yourself to not talk about (in any of the 12 languages besides English she speaks).", "YTA for 'calling her out' after you discovered she spoke Greek.", "Agreed.  \n\nStudies have shown that polyglots don\u2019t always realise that a language being spoken around them\nhas changed - they automatically just participate without noticing.", "Maybe op doesn't ask questions about her? Maybe she isn't a bragger. Who knows.", "Yeah OPs girlfriend was being extremely polite by not commenting on OPs mother health condition even though she clearly heard and understood the convo.", "She, OP is a female.", "Assuming that someone doesn\u2019t speak a language is your own fault", "But she also says she would say \"basic things\" to her cousin. And if she's talking to her mother in front of her girlfriend, she could at least explain to the girlfriend \"Excuse us, we're just talking about a health issue and it's easier for my mother in Greek.\" Or don't have those conversations in front of her. \n\nWhatever language you're talking, don't have private conversations in front of someone else, as you are excluding them.", "Not telling her every language she knows doesn't make an AH \ud83d\ude44", "It sounds like OP was deliberately excluding the gf every time she spoke it, and making it pretty obvious. The whole thing is just incredibly rude, and the gf was probably very uncomfortable. It really isn't about the language, but about the fact that neither of them were communicating, while OP was being insufferable. It sounds like the gf gets walked all over and doesn't speak up. It's OP's fault for being super rude, but overall they probably shouldn't be together at all if they have this kind of dynamic where the gf is scared to speak up and OP gets super angry when she finally has the courage to.", "I think they are referring to the fact that you had phone conversations with your mother while she was next to you in affigeren language. If you want to have a private phonecall it\u2019s polite to leave.", "i would say she didnt realize you were purposefully speaking in Greek to keep her from understanding/hearing private information, and simply thought your mother doesnt speak english. \"Ah private convesation, gonna listen the other way\", and after a couple minutes (of the first call) she forgets to mention it because well, her gf is having a private call and she isnt trying to listen into the conversation.\n\nIf you speak 3-4 languages, let alone 13 fluently, you tend to forget that sometimes people use a \"foreign\" language purposely so \"locals\" cant understand them. Maybe she has been to Greece, or watched media in Greek every now and then, and didnt think twice about it.", "Why are you lying lol yous were saying more than just a few words here and there before she heard a statement in Greek and she replied in a statement. That\u2019s more than a random word.", "YTA IMO. Honestly, if someone told me they understood my language at all, I\u2019d be so happy to hear that we can communicate multiple ways! You\u2019ve purposefully been using Greek to try and have \u201cprivate\u201d conversations publicly. \n\nShe not some kind of spy, OP. She\u2019s a polyglot, which is pretty rare by itself. I\u2019m sure she has better things to do then spy on your conversations. If the information is private, TREAT THE CONVERSATION AS PRIVATE AND MOVE TO A DIFFERENT SPACE.", "OP is female.", "*her mother", "I am here from the Alphabet Mafia to say 6 months is a long time in lesbiam dating.  \ud83d\ude06\n\n\nOp YTA, try to get to know your partner some", "Same but I am American so people assume I barely speak English. The absolute shock when they learn I understand is a special sort of delicious.", "You have to doubt this is real because OP probably didn\u2019t realize how unlikely that was was before posting. Any rare instances aside, in this particular instance I\u2019m going to call this one highly unlikely.", "And that\u2019s a big difference between being fluent \u2026", "That\u2019s how I feel, we all speak the common language in a group setting regardless of whether a couple of us can speak another. It\u2019s just basic respect for those who won\u2019t understand, even if it\u2019s small things like \u2018pass me x\u2019, if they understand in the common language why do it another", "How is she supposed to know it's supposed to be secret when mom only speaks Greek? She isn't a mind reader!", "It's not obvious to me that the mother's health was a secret. Mom speaks Greek, of course he speaks in her language, even if they're only talking about the weather.", "Maybe GF didn't realize that OP intended to exclude her from that part of the conversation.", "Both are women. May want to edit it.", "Yeah, but. If someone started talking about that private subject, and before you got to tell them you also speak the language, you was told it was private and they didnt want ti share it... Would you not find it awkward to tell them? After you know about your MILs butt rash?", "Then maybe not talk about it in front of other people? Even if a person does not speak the language, some medical terms are very distinct and can be understood by someone with limited medical knowledge even without knowing the exact language.\n\nAlso OP is a she.\n\nIts more fascinating tho that they are dating for 6 months and this topic didnt come up once. I know the language proficiency of people whose apartment I have been to twice just by casually checking their book shelf/thus talking about it.", "*she's hiding her", "Oh my bad \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I dunno. That's not how I process/present information personally. Like she could have I guess? But to my brain that sounds weird and unnatural and it's just not something I'd do.\n\nLike I wouldnt assume a Greek person not living in Greece can speak Greek. And if I found out from hearing a phone call I would feel really weird being like 'i heard you can speak Greek... I also can speak Greek' \n\nJust nope. I would totally be OPs GF in this scenario.", "Maybe she didn't listen? I don't listen if my fiance has a private conversation. I think it is really rude to listen.\n\nI would think my partner tells me the important stuff, if he wants to.", "But like, HOW would you even bring that up?\n\n\"Hey babe - heard you talking about your mom's medical condition on the phone in Greek. FYI - I speak Greek \ud83d\ude05. You might want to move to another room in the future for private conversations. (Also, it's rude to have a conversation in front of me just cuz u think I can't understand \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\"\n\nTotally natural.", "Nah I disagree that\u2019s an independent hobby that is probably done on a computer not needing lots of equipment for. It\u2019s not like golf or crafting where it\u2019s visibly obvious what a partner does. She held on to it and that\u2019s ok and clearly he never asked her what hobbies she has. It was 6 months not 6 years so it\u2019s unreasonable to expect that info to be volunteered yet. More over its just a hobby she withheld not an STD result.", "Your example doesn't work here. They are not strangers on the street but two people in a relationship. \n\nThe point is not that OP was speaking about private matters in a foreign language, but that they know each others for a long time and neither talked about what language they speak/know. \n\nI find weird that she didn't seem to care that OP is of Greek origin despite knowing the language and learning languages as a hobby. I also find weird that OP doesn't seem to know her hobbies. She claims to speak 13 languages and this has never once came up?", "but YOU know about it dont you? are you Chinese or Japanese yourself, and your husband didnt tell you he speaks your language, and instead chose to keep all communications in english?", "Particularly when you share one of those and might have heard your SO discuss very private matters in front of you, not knowing you can understand them.", "she!", "That was my thought. If someone switched to another language to speak to their mom, I'd assume that was for privacy. And waiting until they got off the phone to say \"oh, btw I speak Greek\" would be reaaaaly awkward. So the Convo with the cousin was casual enough that it felt a good time bring it up. And the GF definitely could've failed to mention it before if she speaks so many, especially if she knows others that are equally as talented. You forget what others don't have/can't do when you're constantly surrounded by those that do have/can do.", "It is weird not to tell your partner though \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

If she was supposed to know, she'd be told.\n\nAlso, if my other half was on the phone with their sick mother, making sure she's OK would be a priority to me, far more important than keeping the secret that I spoke their language.", "woop my bad, thank ya", "It'd be awkward but I would still tell them so that something like this doesn't happen in the future and to let my partner know I respect both their and their mother's privacy.", "Naw, OP\u2019s bad. They\u2019re together for 6 months and they don\u2019t know this? What have they been talking about all this time? OP\u2019s interests and hobbies??? I think there is a communication issue here\u2026", "Yeah, that doesn\u2019t sound unnatural to me at all. Someone mentions something about themselves in the \u2018starting to date\u2019 process, you excitedly mention this thing you have in common. But, everyone\u2019s different. \n\nYeah, reading this part is odd to *me*. People can only speak languages if they\u2019re in the country that language stems from? Interesting. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have to throw in that you heard them on a call, because it should\u2019ve been mentioned way earlier. \n\nOP\u2019s gf in this scenario is an odd one.

There's no way something like this never comes up in a conversation after six months together and an undefinite time as friends before that.", "I mean ... maybe take private conversations outside of the room rather than have them in front of someone you assume doesn't speak the language. How rude to have an entire conversation (in person, on the phone, doesn't matter) in front of someone in another language and purposefully exclude them. You don't want people to overhear what you are saying because it is private, you remove yourself to a private location. This is basic manners.", "Yea but it\u2019s been 6 months not just one convo has happened . Why has never mentioned it", "I can see what you mean", "Yeah, unless learning Greek was a traumatic experience, I can't understand why she should keep it a secret", "She didn\u2019t ask \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "So, it\u2019s on OP for not know she spoke 13 language, but not on her for not sharing this?", "> Yeah, reading this part is odd to me. People can only speak languages if they\u2019re in the country that language stems from? Interesting.\n\nWhere the hell did I say that? Obviously there are plenty of people who do. But I honestly think assuming they all would seems racist. Like, I know a lot of Filipino Australians and none of them can speak tagalog. Their parents can - but they can't. I also have loads of Italian friends who can't speak Italian etc etc.\n\nIf I was getting to know someone and they assumed someone of a different race who was born here knew the language that would make me really uncomfortable and I would assume they're ignorant for making such a big assumption. It would be a weird thing to assume in the infancy of getting to know a partner.\n\nOPs girlfriend is not odd. She just has a different thought process to you.", "Right. After the private conversation has already been heard. OP is butthurt that private conversations were already heard - I can't imagine that bringing it up right after said conversation wouldn't immediately lead to an argument. \n\nMoreover, there's no reasonable expectation to a private conversation... if you have that conversation right in front of another person. That's like being upset that someone saw you naked ... when you are changing right in front of them. \"You should have told me you had eyes - I wouldn't have gotten gotten naked in front of you!\" \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  \n\nWhile it's fair to assume that *most* people probably don't speak Greek, if you don't want private conversation to be heard, much like changing your clothes, you should do it somewhere private.", "1. You don't know the living situation of OP. She might not have the space to remove herself out of hearing range.\n\n2. Since OP has mentioned that those private conversations had to do with her mother's health, OP probably was anxious to take the call. I don't think that's rude.\n\n2. It's not some random person that OP's talking about. She's her partner. Even if the topic didn't come up, the moment she noticed OP's having a private conversation she could and should've said that she speaks the language.

But, why would I assume they can\u2019t either just because they don\u2019t live there?\n\nHm. Big jump. Assuming someone doesn\u2019t know a language unless they\u2019re from said country seems ignorant also. Don\u2019t assume, just ask. Or in this situation \u201cOh, you\u2019re x, I speak x! Do you as well?\u201d Or *anything* like that.\n\nDefinitely different, still odd.", "1) I live in 400 square feet. My significant other steps outside if there is a phone conversation they'd like to remain private. \n\n2) My significant other has an alcoholic brother - anxiety is the name of the game, but they can still step outside for conversations.\n\n3) How does one naturally bring up - \"Hey, you were rudely speaking about personal matters in front of me with the assumption that I couldn't speak the language but I can so ... \ud83d\ude05\"? Its not eavesdropping if you make no concerted effort whatsoever to remove the conversation to a private place. Walk out of the room. Walk outside. Whisper. But don't speak in another language and get butthurt when it turns out the language is known by another party."]}
