It was a moment of shock for me because she never mentioned she spoke Greek before.\n\nI was saying pretty basic things with my cousin then but she'd heard me speak on the phone, curse to myself and never mentioned she spoke it. I didn't say anything then but once I got to my place with Alex, I called her out on it.\n\nShe said she speaks multiple languages as a hobby and it was not a big deal. I made her count. There were 13 that she was fluent in. My point was as my girlfriend she should've told ne earlier about this and she heard my conversations around the house and never commented on them (they were mostly about my mom's difficult health situation and she doesn't want that to be shared - she doesn't even tell my brother, I know because we're have a special mother daughter relationship)\n\nEdit: I only ever talked to my mom in Greek in front of Alexandra and it was mostly in the car while we were both in it.

The only reason why you'd be unhappy about this is if you wanted free pass to lie to her face about conversations that you're having around her, or just the ability to shit talk about her to your friends/relatives without her understanding. \n\nYTA because it seems that you're angry about the fact that you can no longer shit talk around her rather than the fact that you didn't know about this hobby of hers.", "Did you ever ask her if she spoke another language? Why does she have disclose every language she partly speaks to you \n\nYTA for overreacting. It seems super suspicious that you get triggers by this, are you trying to hide things from her and worry she will find out", "YTA if she speaks 13 languages,  how big a deal is it, in her world,  that she speaks Greek?\n\nTo her it is akin to where she vacationed as a child. Part of who she is.\n\nI think you this is actually about you not working hard enough to learn about your partner.  Have you asked her about her hobbies and interests?", "YTA. \n\n>Sometimes we'd slide in a few words\n\n>I was saying pretty basic things with my cousin\n\nSo you were deliberately excluding her from your conversation, thinking she didn't speak Greek. That is just rude as heck. You should be thankful she came forward and let you know before you went beyond saying *basic things.*", "YTA\u2026 for your unintentional lack of foresight. There's this unspoken rule wherein we don't speak another language in front of other people so that they don't feel excluded. Especially if they are our friends. Also why would you talk to your mother about her health, a topic which she's not comfortable talking about in the presence of people that are not her family? Couldn't you have waited until the two of you are alone?", "NAH  \n\n\nIt probably got a bit weird at some point when she realised you were speaking Greek fluently and she didn\u2019t know how to say \u201cHey! I speak that\u201d but then found a casual low impact way to bridge the now obvious gap.   \n\n\nHow did you have a girlfriend for six months and not know enough about her hobbies to know she spoke THIRTEEN LANGUAGES FLUENTLY?", "13 languages? You sure she doesn\u2019t work for the CIA?? I\u2019d be too impressed to care.", "The fact that you don't know she speaks 13!!! Languages fluently is a sign that you are not so interested in getting to know her.\nIf you would have asked what are you interested in ore what are your hobbies  am sure you wouId have known.", "YTA. The only reason I can think of for you to be angry over this is because you purposefully wanted to say things in front of her that she wouldn\u2019t understand, which begs the question \u2014 why would you want to be so rude and non-inclusive of your girlfriend?", "NAH, because honestly there's a lot that may not come up naturally in just six months but I understand you're upset at accidentally disclosing your mother's private medical information. \n\nImo, she probably heard bits and pieces over the phone, understood that it was a private conversation, and didn't bring up what was said with you because she knew it was none of her business. Pretending you didn't hear private information is a very common social expectation in my experience, and it is seen as a courtesy. \n\nYou never tried to talk to her in Greek, you never spoke with someone in a situation where she could reasonably join in (interrupting phone calls is rude), and now that she had the opportunity for the first time she did join in naturally. \n\nAlternatively, it's quite possible that she has had men judge her in the past and didn't want to bring it up because of that. Many men are unfortunately intimidated by women having talents, especially talents that give one high social standing, like speaking 13 languages. And when you have a hobby like that, it is easy for other people to misinterpret you as being a braggart when you're just trying to talk about something you like and that is important to you. \n\nI personally had a hobby that was misinterpreted by others, although along a different axis, and I got into the habit of keeping it totally to myself as a method of self-protection. It was something very important to me, but also something I saw as completely separate from other people -- a hobby I could only enjoy in isolation. \n\nIf you continue holding this against her, YWBTA, but some kneejerk bad feelings due to being caught unawares is I think understandable.", "Yta, have you ever once asked her what her hobbies or interests are?", "YTA for expecting to be able to have secret conversations around your girlfriend and being upset that she can understand them. Doing that is super rude anyway.", "YTA, and she probably assumed you knew already. I mean, you are speaking in a \"foreign\" language with your gf right there and didnt bother to translate. So from her point you are either 1) incredibly rude and inconsiderate to your partner or 2) know she at least understands a bit of what youre saying right in front of her.\n\napparently you **never** said \"sorry, i was just saying (in Greek) that...\" to which she could have answered \"dont worry, im really good in Greek myself\"", "YTA. \n\nWhy is this offensive in any way? And if you thought she couldn't speak Greek, why were you speaking it (even basic words) with your cousin while the three of you were together? I think not mentioning you speak a language is less rude than excluding someone in the room from a conversation.", "If she\u2019s speaks 13 languages the fact that you speak another language probably felt inconsequential in her head. Also idk about all languages but if you speaking one of many Latin languages she probably just didn\u2019t register it.", "Yta. Sure it could be weird that you don\u2019t know but it\u2019s as weird that you don\u2019t know about her hobbie and how many languages she speaks to as much as she\u2019s not told you she speaks Greek. You\u2019ve never asked her about her hobbie\u2026. 13 languages\u2026 she\u2019s clearly been respectful when understanding conversations she wasn\u2019t ment to. She\u2019s not mentioned she can understand the conversations about ur mums health coz it\u2019s personal and you didn\u2019t want her hearing it. She dosnt even say she can understand so obviously wouldn\u2019t divulge any information. She\u2019s not used her secretly knowing Greek to spy or anything so what\u2019s the issue. Sure it\u2019s weird to not know but to start a argument with when she\u2019s not actualy caused any damage or harm or done anything wrong. Is a ass move", "YTA your own assumption so it is in you. Start feeling proud of your girlfriend...believe me she will appreciate that a lotttttt more.", "YTA and it seems like you haven\u2019t really got to know each other very well \n\nIt\u2019s rude to have private conversations literally in front of someone. What were you saying in front of her that you didn\u2019t want her to know?", "YTA for sure and I\u2019d like to meet a person like her.", "13 languages?!?! Holy shit that's hot. I want to date her.", "YTA.  It seems to me that you are still in the getting to know you phase of your relationship.  Now you know she speaks Greek!  13 languages is amazing!  I'm guessing you never asked her what languages she speaks or about all of her hobbies.", "YTA because you just assumed she wouldn't understand. It's not her fault that she did. This reminds me of those articles of tourists talking shit in their native language, assuming people don't understand, and then getting caught and embarrassed.", "YTA. Surely you would be happy she spoke Greek? But instead of treating it like a moment for celebration you act as if you've lost some sort of power over her. \n\nAlso, never assume that people can't understand you while speaking in front of them, whatever language you're using. That's a really naive way to go about life.", "YTA in any of the 13 languages she speaks, and others she doesn't. Why does she have to tell you what languages she speaks? Why do you feel you have to call her out? If there are conversations you don't want others to hear have them in private.  I would say it is ruder  to have conversations in a language you think someone  doesn't understand while they are there. Grow up or move on", "YTA, because major world languages aren\u2019t secret code. There\u2019s nothing wrong with saying something in Greek to your mother in front of your girlfriend, but assuming you are speaking in secret is ridiculous, and rude.", "Hold on. She\u2019s fluent in 13 languages? \u2014Not proficient. Fluent. Does anyone else find that hard to believe?", "YTA\n\nAs an immigrant myself, I learned early that you can NEVER assume that others don\u2019t understand you, regardless where/which language. Rookie mistake, but now you know. \n\nYou should actually marvel at the fact that your gf speaks 13 different languages. But it\u2019s weird that you \u201emade her count\u201c.", "YTA. Why aren\u2019t you getting to know her and asking her things about herself? Being long time acquaintances at work meant you had a long time and likely multiple opportunities to get to know her prior, and now 6 months together? If I were your gf I wouldn\u2019t be particularly thrilled with you as partner due to lacking interest in getting to know me well.", "NAH \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been in this situation, but I don\u2019t think it was rude of OP to have convos in Greek while her GF is in the room and assume she doesn\u2019t understand. My ex was from India and would often speak to his parents in the phone in Hindi while I was in the room. Because of time difference and the size of his apartment we weren\u2019t left with a lot of privacy for these conversations. He\u2019d fill me in on some things, but I also didn\u2019t feel the need to pressure info out that he wasn\u2019t comfortable sharing. \n\nIt is really weird for the GF to hear OP frequently speaking Greek in front of her and not say \u201chey I speak Greek too!\u201d Not even to warn her that she understands but just pointing out something they share. Definitely comes across like she was hiding it or something. \n\nOP also could have warned her, \u201chey I\u2019m speaking with my mom and Greek is the best way for us to do this. Also some of the information is things my mom would like to keep between just her and I.  just so you know but it\u2019s nothing about you or anything lol\u201d which could have easily opened the door to that convo too.\n\nETA typo", "I say ESH..\n\nGf is a soft A for not sharing this info. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s super important to know but it is strange that she knows you speak Greek and never thought of telling you. Maybe because she grew speaking 13 languages, she feels that it\u2019s normal but still. Or maybe she thought you already knew. Either way, she\u2019s less at fault here.\n\nYTA for reacting the way you did. I understand you were blindsided in a way, you weren\u2019t expecting her to know your language but you reacted as if she cheated on you. If you speak to someone about something private next to someone else, don\u2019t just assume that this person doesn\u2019t understand you and don\u2019t get angry at them once you realize they do. That\u2019s on you.\n\nApologize to your gf if you want to salvage this relationship and tell her that you were just not expecting this. And if you want, do a questionnaire to avoid this kind of situations in the future.", "YTA. Languages outside of English are not an exclusive secret. You should be proud that she\u2019s fluent in so many languages. Never assume someone can\u2019t speak another language. If you wanted to have private conversations about your mother\u2019s health, those conversations can happen in PRIVATE, away from anyone within earshot.", "YTA, why are you speaking in front of her in different languages presuming she doesn\u2019t understand. Why not ask if she speaks any Greek? Why speak basic words when the three of you are hanging out? \n\nIf she actually didn\u2019t speak it, that\u2019s quite rude no? Unless your cousin speaks zero English and it was a matter of having to communicate in your language, then you\u2019re rude. Rude and assuming when actually she\u2019s brilliant. \n\nMost people would think fantastic, she can communicate with my family and wow she\u2019s incredible being able to speak 13 languages. But you take it like some deception because actually she\u2019s understood you trying to talk in front of her but not including her", "13 LANGUAGES :O your gf is my hero. \n\nIm tossing between nah and soft tiny yta. You are still getting to know each other and for some bringing up things like intelligence or wealth can be difficult subjects to broach, especially only 6 months in. She may not have wanted to appear bragging and deter you, maybe shes had partners or dates react negatively to her abilities in the past. Maybe sit down and find out how much of your mothers health she has heard and just ask her to keep it between you as its stuff your mother doesnt want getting out.", "YTA trying to have convos in your language, you\u2019re just mad she understood you.", "INFO: did you ask her since when she speaks Greek? I\u2019d be a bit weirded out if she spoke it before you met and she never mentioned it. But I also find it weird that it never came up that languages are her hobby, like how is that possible? Do you two not have conversations? \n\nIt is entirely possible that she learned it after meeting you and wanted to surprise you. It is also possible that she withheld the information to see how you speak about her when you think she won\u2019t understand. So I withhold judgement for now as her intentions matter. Hence the question when she learned it is crucial. \n\nI get your reaction, I would\u2019ve had the same. The Y T A crowds however focus (rightfully) how this didn\u2019t come up.

Not hard.\n\nKeep pinning blame on her and she won't be an issue hearing your conversations as she won't be around - you should be proud, impressed and complimenting her multi-language abilities and kick yourself for not seeing this as a great thing and your own fault for assuming.", "YTA Why would she need to volunteer this information? It apparently never came up nor did you ask. If you didn\u2019t care enough to ask, why would she need to tell\u2026", "this seems like a very trivial thing to be mad about considering she continued to respect your privacy even if she could understand it. \n\nfurthermore, i think you should be very happy that you found somebody who can speak the same language as you, speaking as an immigrant in a foreign country desperately seeking compatriots who I can speak my own language to.\n\nYTA", "Yeah. Yta. You just assume no one understands you. Def a you a problem. Ask next time.", "YTA\n\nI don't know why you are getting mad that she speaks your language. Why get mad about it?", "ESH - it's weird that she didn't mention that she spoke Greek since she has heard you have private conversations in Greek. It seems weird that she didn't think it was worth mentioning. But it's equally bizarre that you didn't know she also speaks a dozen other languages. She must be practicing very regularly with at least some of them. How have the two of you never discussed her hobbies enough for this to come up. \n\nIs it possible that she learned Greek as an ill-conceived but cute little surprise for you and then when you didn't find it cute she tried to brush the whole thing off to avoid pissing you off even more? It's the only way I can make sense of this unless she was trying to catch you talking about her in Greek or you are so self absorbed you never asked her about her interests.", "NAH or maybe NTA. If you were purposefully trying to get away with saying gross/nasty things in front of her by using greek YWBTA.\n\nIt's basically that you obviously use greek to have sensitive conversations with your mother/family.

How much do you know about her likes and hobbies, I wonder? Or did she share and you just weren\u2019t paying attention? This is massively weird.

How someone can tell you they speak 13 languages and your next emotion isn\u2019t just pure awe is beyond me.

Obviously she isn't going to tell you \"I HEARD YOUR PRIVATE CONVO\". She was waiting for you to let her in and talk about it on your own terms. You are too young for an adult relationship.", "YTA-you\u2019re the one who made the assumption here.", "YTA whatchu hiding that she needs to tell you all the languages she speaks/understands?", "Isn\u2019t it incredibly rude to converse in a different language with someone when you are with your SO/friends/colleagues? There are exceptions (like if you had to talk to someone who only speaks Spanish), but it seems you deliberately had multiple conversations in front of your gf assuming she didn\u2019t speak the language. That is not indicative of respectful behavior.\n\nI also suspect part of your resentment is because 1. your gf knows more languages than you and 2. you can no longer pull off conversations in front of her without her knowing what it was about. \n\nYTA.\n\nYTA.", "You really need to have a questionnaire form that potential girlfriends can fill out first, like hobbies, personal history, languages spoken, that sort of thing. That way, you'd never be taken by surprise by a girlfriend's accomplishments. \n\nOn the other hand, she may also think that speaking in another language in front of her in a way designed to exclude her and make her feel irrelevant is an AH move.\n\nYTA, I'm afraid.", "YTA, very obviously you don\u2019t know your gf lol", "When you found out she was fluent in 13 languages didn't you asked which one were they?", "YTA. \n\nIt have never come up before - so she'd never mentioned it before.

These types of things come up organically- like it did in this moment. You never asked her, why did she need to volunteer it? Your expectation of her communicating this to you is only bc you feel ashamed you didn\u2019t know and had what you felt were private conversations in front of her. She clearly recognized they were private and said nothing to not embarrass you. Had you never had those conversations in front of her and this moment happened you probably would have been amazed by her. Instead you are acting like a brat about it. Lucky you your girlfriend is freaking amazing bc she can speak 13 languages, instead your annoyed. Get over yourself.", "Both are lowkey TA. \n\nAfter six months and after a longer period where the two knew each others, not telling that she speaks Greek is not good and I can't think of a single reason why she avoided telling you. When I was trying to learn Portuguese I was jumping at every native speaker I could find to practise so I find weird that she didn't want to try practise Greek with you. \n\nOn the other hand, also you not knowing is a bit weird after all this time. Either she lied about it or you never directly asked her if she spoke other languages. And since she said learning languages is a hobby of her, you should have known that at some point in your relationship. \n\nSeems to me you guys should talk more about each other. \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac to your mother, in any case.", "YTA\n\nDid you ask her?

Especially if the health issues your mom is going through our particularly stressful, your girlfriend probably didn't want to add on to that stress by letting you know that you just exposed a bunch of your mom's medical history in front of her.

Hiding the fact you know 13 languages, one of them being a language your SO speaks, feels very invasive, as if she enjoyed being that mysterious person in the background thinking \"ha ha they don't know I understand them\".

The question that should be asked is \"why didn't she tell you that she knows Greek when she found out that you're Greek?\". She KNEW you are Greek, she knew you speak the language, and for some reason decided to keep the fact that she understands Greek to herself. A non suspicious person, and one who respects your privacy, would say \"oh I know Greek too!\" the second you tell them that you're Greek. ESPECIALLY if they're interested in you romantically. Aren't they supposed to share when something you have in common pops up? Your girlfriend must've noticed the private conversations you had with your mother, and the decent thing to do would be to mention it later on, and show interest in your mother's health, and the only reasons I can think of why she didn't do that are:\n1.

I think people are being a bit harsh with OP to assume that she is annoyed because she wants to badmouth her gf behind her back. Another perpective to look at this from is OP was discussing private health matters with their mother in Greek and assumed it was fine because their gf didn\u2019t understand but rather than excuse herself the gf continued to pretend she didn\u2019t understand whilst clearly being able to hear what OP was discussing with their mother. It almost seems like OPs gf wanted to be able eavesdrop on OPs Greek conversations and probably slipped when the cousin was around.

And one hobby falls by the wayside.   \n\n\nIn my mind you do find out about all the major hobbies along the way, which is why I can\u2019t work out why this never came up. Didn\u2019t the OP notice when they were at restaurants that had other languages on the menus that the GF could read and translate them all? (Or is this only an Aussie thing where the Italian and Greek and Chinese places have their language on the menus and English beside it for the less familiar stuff?)  Was there never a time that the OP noticed htey spoke another language and asked them? Did the OP actually spend enough time ASKING the GF who they were and what they studied?

Had OPS partner cared to be part of the conversation she'd have joined BEFORE the medical talk. Once it happened once she should have disclosed.", "Do you know how HARD that can be to do while driving? Have you ever had to do it? Because my grandfather was born in Europe and spoke English well and struggled to do it even after 60 years living in America. \n\n\n\n\nIs it not MORE rude that the gf KNEW how to communicate with a non English speaker and chose not to disclose she knew the language, instead listening in on medical information.", "Nah, that's not the bigger question, the bigger question is still 'why are you eavesdropping on personal conversation regarding my mother's medical situation?' Your question is a pretty distant second place. Usually people with average communication skills would offer important information, or personal hobbies and interests, rather than waiting for their partner to dig it out of them. Furthermore, at some stage OP must have mentioned, 'I am of Greek origin and speak the language', since the partner knows these things, at which point, I feel most people would inform them that they also speak the language.", "Assuming someone can't understand you is rude. So is sitting there and playing along with it listening to private conversations not mentioning you understand it all. I don't get why people can't understand this. It doesn't take much just let them know, besides, why tf would you never speak it in front of them anyway? She has never thought to speak Greek to op's mum who only speaks Greek?", "The first time it happened, you're right. The burden of assumption is on OP, BUT after the first time, as someone who speaks two languages, it's YOUR responsibility to disclose that you understand. The only reason not to is to continue to snoop or listen in. OPs partner KNEW that OPs mom couldn't speak any English. This happened more than once. After the first time, there's no reason to remain silent unless your invading privacy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen an older woman in that culture thinks people can't understand they will take the time to talk more candidly about things like health because either way, she can't communicate with the gf so they may as well talk about what they need to instead of small talk.", "The first time it happened, yes. The burden of assumption was on op. AFTER the FIRST time she should have disclosed, she understood. There's n9 reason not to unless she WANTED to be able to listen in and be sneaky. Who benefits by her not disclosing? She's not able to engage with OPs mom, she's not able to share the culture with op. What benefit was there from not telling? Other than snooping.", "But then she freely spoke it around his cousin? If she felt weird about it disclosing is the first thing you do. Or you interrupt the conversation and let them know you understand. You use Greek in the greetings if you want to avoid awkward situations. There was no reason not to greet his only Greek speaking mother in Greek. Disclosing earlier would have saved her the embarrassment AND let her bond with the mother. There was no reason not to disclose unless it was to be a snoop", "She didn't know about the other languages though! \n\nAlso: 3 seconds in to knowing someone \"I am greek\" \"oh cool, I speak Greek!\"\nNOT saying that is weird weird weird.\n\nI speak 4/5 languages and wouldn't dream of withholding that info from a native speaker. Even if we were just chatting at the bus stop...it is absurd not to mention it and I never met anyone who concealed the languages they spoke.  ...I would consider it either unhinged or suspicious.", "I speak 3 constantly and, although sometimes struggle to find a word, it is possible to rephrase/explain. And you do feel the difference between languages.\n\nIt was not \"yes/no/let's go\", it was \"basic things\". It is rude.", "I agree, it\u2019s phrases are fine. But it wasn\u2019t just a few words, and I\u2019m obviously not talking about just a few word given the context. I\u2019m talking about whole conversations. No one in the comments, nor the OP, said it was just a few words.\nIt\u2019s okay to feel moderately about something.\n\n\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not about knowing languages, it\u2019s about intentionally leaving people out who are present.", "This is what I'm thinking. Maybe she isn't as fluent as she wants to be and thought it would be cool to surprise her gf. Or the gf knows OP has some insecurities about things and thought this wasn't a hobby she could share. I dated someone who was really put off by learning driven hobbies because it made her feel insecure so I just didn't share certain things interests with her.", "Maybe she never talked about it because OP has never shown any interest in their personal hobbies.", "The only thing I can think of is, maybe she didnt tell OP, because the only times OP had spoken Greek so far was a very personal phone call. \n\nIf someone started speaking in a language I knew, near me, to someone else, about personal health issues, I\u2019m not sure I would speak up. I don\u2019t want to embarrass both individuals on the call, or deal with the blowback that\u2019s bound to happen once someone realizes they \u201couted\u201d information like that accidentally.

Yeah, I agree that it's baffling. But I still think that's on the GF for not telling OP, not on OP for not thinking to ask the GF.", "That all sounds like a lot of assumptions you're making.\n\nWhether or not OP has noticed anything and asked about it isn't the point, the GF is the one that speaks multiple languages, the onus is on her to tell OP that. Especially after she started overhearing OPs calls to her mother. Shouldn't take a genius to realize that OP didn't know the GF could understand what she's saying.", "I do too, but if I overheard something worrying about my partner or an immediate family member, I would be more concerned about their wellbeing than my secret linguistic skills.", "After 6 months of speaking Greek around her GF, it's not an assumption that GF doesn't speak Greek. It's a lie of omission by the GF.\n\nGF had so many chances to tell her. I can't see why it wouldn't be the first thing out of her mouth when she found out GF was Greek. \"You're Greek? That's awesome, I can speak some Greek!\"\n\nGF intentionally hid that she could speak Greek. Intentionally hiding that you can experience your partner's heritage in a cool way is shifty and I can't see a good reason for it except for wanting to catch you out in some way.", "You saying the most random things is hilarious. At any point she could\u2019ve said she spoke multiple languages, especially the one OP speaks. Seems like a normal thing to mention.\n\nLol always with the scenarios. \u201cWhat if\u201d. Well, we know what *did* happen. Which is she kept from OP that she understood his language lmao. \n\nNever commented on this part, don\u2019t care if this is rude (the phone call). What **I** said was that it\u2019s weird she didn\u2019t mention she spoke his language. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all. Argue about the other part with someone else.", "I just commented this with an example but I keep getting the feeling that OP's \"conversations\" are more like: \"let me tell you all about me\" get-to-know-yous and GF is left waiting for \"her turn\" which never comes...something about the whole: mom's medical info isn't even shared with OP's brother because it's a special mother-daughter relationship makes it seem like well...OP thinks they're special/more important...ummmm once we're all grownups? If mom is having an issue? My brothers know. Especially if she's ill and only tells me about it. (I'm imagining Greek mom's are a lot like Mexican moms...and hell yes I use my special mother/daughter relationship to get the info and tell tell my brothers (who are old enough to be parents themselves) if she needs to go get extra scans regardless of what the issue is.)", "Generally it comes up in conversation...I get the feeling it's all one-direction here if OP hasn't found out she can speak thirteen different languages?

Let me tell you all about it...\n\n\\----1 hour later---\n\nGF: How amazing, you know what...\n\nOP: OH It's time we go to the movie...concert...etc...", "Yes but its definitely more plausible that she knew he was Greek for a long time . Like that\u2019s one of the first things you learn about somebody in a relationship is their heritage.", "I think the girlfriend should\u2019ve disclosed since she frequently interacts with people of Greek descent, however, I do think it\u2019s not her fault that she knows sensitive information in this case.", "She wasn't eavesdropping. They were having the convo right in front of her. Honestly, it is really rude to just assume someone can't understand you. Even if they can't speak your language, if you know a close language, you can pick up a lot.", "No it isn't. If you want a conversation to be private then it's on you to ensure it is.", "Your logic doesn't make sense.\n\nReplace language with volume. If someone is having a private conversation loud enough for others to hear, who is at fault? The person speaking loudly or the people who happened to be able to hear? Clearly it's the former.", "Probably this; after all, OP is having \"private\" conversations in the car while the girlfriend is present - I don't think she's really cares that much.", "Yes, that could be it. However, I don't think it could be embarassing to say after the first time this happen 'just fyi, I understand Greek and what you're saying' especially if you're speaking with your partner in a relationship. Sooner or later it would come out anyway, better be honest about it upfront.", "The girlfriend speaks 13 additional languages. She\u2019s spent years studying languages as a hobby. That kind of talent and interest is noticeable. This is like dating Jackson Pollock and not noticing that he paints.", "It just never came up I guess and OP didn't make any attempt so both of them stayed on a sort of neutral ground. Also, OP getting mad about this is suspicious, unless they're shit talking their girlfriend or hiding stuff, this whole thing doesn't need to blow up", "Oh, like asking \"Okay if I have a private conversation with my mother in another language while you and I drive together in the car to an event?\" It's just a point of relation that you should share with your significant other, right?", "I\u2019m wondering where in the world the OP\u2019s girlfriend is from.   \nThey both speak greek.   \nI\u2018m wondering if this is a collection of European languages\u2026   \nAnd if the GF is from somewhere that has multiple primary languages and where learning many language is more common/near normal.   \nIn which case it could be a case of missed opportunity to discuss/assumption   \n\n\nAnd yes. I\u2019m making assumptions. But\u2026 I\u2019m trying to work out WHY they havne\u2019t shared this fact, and one possible scenario (amongst many) is that this is actually kind of \u2018normal\u2019 in some parts of the world.   \n\n\nSwiss people speak multiple languages.   \nAs do most of the Nordic and Asian countries.  \n\n\nSo is this at play? A cultural clash where they didn\u2019t realise they needed to share this?   \n\n\nYep. Assumptions ahoy!", ">  I wouldn\u2019t assume they could or couldn\u2019t.\n\nNeither would I. This is made apparent when you consider I never implied they wouldn't be able to - only that I wouldn't assume they definitely could because of their heritage.\n\nLmao what I'm saying is not odd at all and you're deliberately trying to misrepresent what I very clearly stated.\n\n> Assuming someone doesn\u2019t know a language unless they\u2019re from said country seems ignorant also. \n\nExcept I never assumed they don't. I thought it would be impolite to assume either way.", "I've been with my significant other for nearly 5 years and just recently discovered they took some Japanese classes. We've been practicing off and on for over two years and are literally on a flight back from Japan now, and they never thought to bring it up. So yeah, not as weird as you might think to not bring things up - especially 6 only months in. Sometimes things just don't get brought up ... until they do. \n\nI'm not butthurt my significant other didn't tell me about them knowing a bit of Japanese ... because I never had a private conversation in front of them in Japanese.

But the partner should have disclosed after the first time this happened instead of continuing to listen in.", "I meant eavesdropping on the phone calls, her partner should have told her after the first overheard conversation that she understood what was being said, every phonecall she overheard following that was eavesdropping. I'll agree that she shouldn't have chatted with her cousin in Greek though, OP is TA for that at least.\n\nFor the record, Greek is an unusually isolated language, you probably wouldn't be able to understand much from knowing any other languages.", "Yes. After the first time someone your around regularly has a conversation in a language, you know, even if NOT private, you should disclose that you understand. Full stop. To avoid situations like this where in passing someone may mention something they don't want others to hear even by accident.

Op isn't innocent in this but she isn't either.", "If the person who \"happened to be able to hear\" was, say, sitting behind a large piece of furniture and they knew the person talking didn't know they were there, then they would be the ones at fault. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find it really strange that so many people are rushing to defend this very strange behaviour. You don't date someone fo six months and not bother to inform them you speak their native language that they speak in front of you all the time. And to blame the OP for assuming, what? That her girlfriend would surely have mentioned it if she did speak Greek, just as she would have mentioned any other point of interest between them? \"I was under no obligation to disclose the information\" is great in a court of law, but it's not how relationships work.", "But if I heard a conversation that was loud that I shouldn't hear, I'd mention that their voices were raised. \n\n\n\nIts more akin to sign language. Others around you may not understand, so it's common to use sign language to have side conversations or conversations about topics you may not voice. It's polite if you know sign language  to look away and give privacy. If that's not an option, you disclose that you can understand. \n\n\n\n\n\nIts equally rude that she KNEW the mom couldn't speak English and decided not to engage or talk to her at all and let her think she wouldn't be understood if she tried. It was equally as rude that she could have engaged with this woman in her language and chose not to. There was no reason not to disclose in the beginning unless it was to snoop.", "It should be noticeable. Why wasn\u2019t it? Was OP particularly oblivious or did the gf hide it?", "You're right; it is *extremely* bizarre that the girlfriend didn't bring this up in six months of dating.", "No, it\u2019s like dating Banksy and him not mentioning he\u2019s Banksy.", "That seems like more of an opinion than a fact that people should base their judgement on.\n\nAlso, regardless of anything else, she's the one that speaks those languages, the onus is on her to tell people, not on people to ask. Why would we expect someone to ask a question that they didn't even know exists in the first place?\n\nDo you just randomly go around asking every stranger you meet if they speak other languages? I don't see how this is any different.", "Well she would fairly well know if they were shit talking her and I assume she would have brought it up .

Why are you assuming op is shit talking around his girlfriend or wants to lie to her. He literally explained that he was having medical conversations with his mother that his mother wanted to be private.

If I had no inclination that someone spoke another language, then that isn't something that I would think to ask them.

Or that you speak your partners native tongue!!!", "Honestly, that was my first thought. I find it very unlikely. And I am a professional translator/linguist living in Greece. Even when I was doing my master in Translation, most students were speaking on a fluent level 3/4 languages, max 5. Most of them had been actively exposed to their main strong languages since an early age. It is impossible to develop fluency if you are not communicating on a regular basis with native speakers.\nOf course there are some exceptional people (often autistic savants) that have incredible language learning skills. It would be surprising though that OP could have been with such a genius for 6 months without realizing that something was special about them.\nGiven the fact that none of the explanations for the behavior of each of the people involved here makes sense, I think that either this is fake, either OP is keeping essential info from us.", "Either this post is made up or OP is one of those people who calls anyone with an intermediate grasp of a language fluent.", "Pretty much impossible to believe.\n\nFluency means constant practice. She would be practicing at least one language every single day, no exceptions. And it\u2019s clearly a hobby she enjoys so she\u2019d be learning new languages too. It\u2019s pretty intensive time-wise. And not easy to hide since you have to practice speaking and listening, which means calling or meeting with native speakers. It would be a pretty massive part of her daily routine. \n\nFor OP to not know that his GF is a polyglot means she has been actively lying this whole time, lying to him about what she did that day, lying about where she\u2019s going. And it\u2019s not shameful so there\u2019s no reason why she\u2019d be hiding such a big part of her life from her BF.", "Yeah, I feel like someone who is really fluent in 13 languages would definitely have talked about it or shown signs of it way sooner into the relationship. My first impression reading the post was that she's not actually \"fluent\" in Greek - and she never commented on OP's phone calls in Greek because she didn't actually understand them, but that she learned some basics (possibly even after starting to date OP) and finally felt confident enough to try them out during that conversation with the cousin.\n\nBut whatever the truth is, what still doesn't make sense either way is her \"speaking languages as a hobby\" and yet not taking the golden opportunity of practicing her Greek with her Greek gf, or ask her questions about it, or even bond with her over it. All the YTA comments because \"it's rude to assume people can't speak your language\" are baffling, we're not talking about strangers on a bus here, they've supposedly been in a relationship for 6 months.", "Thank you, ofc there\u2019s hyperpolygots but they\u2019re super rare. Someone needs to tell her that a few weeks on duolingo doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re fluent lmao", "FWIW I just assumed she is actually just reasonably proficient and either she or OP were just calling it \"fluent\" as a singular contrast to \"learning\"/\"beginner\".\n\nI think when people talk about languages they know in casual conversation it basically comes down to that dichotomy.", "OP is Greek. Her mom speaks nothing but Greek. Sure, there\u2019s a lot that may not come up in 6 months, but seriously?  The fact that GF speaks Greek just never had an opportunity to be shared?

Especially if you are around bilingual or more people. And especially if my bf's native language is one of them. That's something to connect over immediately.\n\nI don't care how rude it is to interrupt a conversation to let people know you speak the language. It's far ruder to pretend you don't and then have your SO find out after he had private conversations around you that you clearly were eavesdropping on but didn't think to let them know. \n\nHe's not leaving her out of conversations. He's just speaking a native tongue to others who feel more comfortable speaking it. If she didn't speak and wanted to know what was going on, she could ask. But she did speak it and never said a word for weeks or months. And if he had said bad things about her, I'm sure she'd throw that at him. \n\nI've had friends and coworkers speak other languages in front of me when I'm in the room, and I'll ask if I want to know what's going on. Exactly if they were talking my language but about a topic I didn't understand. All she had to do was stop the conversation before it got to heavy and let them know, as its far ruder to hear not one but *multiple* private convos and *then* mention you know the langauge.\n\nNTA.

And knowing you spoke it for weeks or months before ever saying anything.", "Some of these comments are insane.

That kind of hobby is something you bring up in basic getting-to-know you questions in the first couple of dates.

It\u2019s actually not that rude to have a phone conversation with someone else in earshot, in your language or another. \n\n2) she is in a room with the mom, who again, she knows only speaks Greek.

When your girlfriend heard you speaking about private matters around her in Greek, she should've taken 3 seconds to say, \"Hey, I speak Greek and I understand what you're saying.\" Why was she hiding it?", "NTA. People like to try to be clever and keep their language knowledge secret until they get to spring it on you in some big gotcha moment.

But if I have an immigrant mother (which I do but our native language is broken English lol), and she only understood say French, and my partner of 6 months didn't know French to my knowledge, I'd feel comfortable having private conversations in another language quietly without having to hide away in a bunker.\n\nYes there are things your partner isn't entitled to know, yes you're allowed privacy and to assume that OP would willingly enjoy talking shit about their partner while being on a date with their partner and a third party was there, you'd have really infer some out there bizarre insight on OP to assume they'd just sit there and talk shit about their partner. To be able to make that wild assumption on someone you don't know, but then assume it's **totally normal to know 13 languages, never bring this up around someone who speaks two of them, and to not engage in these foreign language yet hear them conversations around the home is bizarre behavior**.\n\nIf anything OP is the less suspicious one because it's much more normal to think the person you're dating only speaks the language you know them to speak as discussions about living elsewhere, travel, learning life skills (my dad taught me hunting when I was a kid we always went camping, my mom was the best cook in the family so I inherited her skills, I lived in Japan for a few years and learned Japanese pretty well etc), all these things are discovered in the first 4 months of serious dating.\n\nYou either have to be really careful to hide that or actively indifferent where they made direct choices to not engage orally with another language when she could. Learning a language is hard, this is like finding out your partner of 6 months who does (for example) marketing for a company has a medical degree and worked as a doctor for a few years and has heard you discussing medical things and medical terminology and says nothing about it. \n\nMost humans don't assume the person around them can speak every language, but in public spaces you truly can't assume no one will understand you. That said, OPs behavior and reaction is quite normal for the average human.

Yes of course you'd be thrilled to know your partner speaks your language - but even if you hadn't had conversations in front of them, they probably know this is your culture and native language - why would they not say something? If it's a first or second date, an acquaintance, a friend, sure - they don't have to tell you everything. But this is a partner! Someone who you spend lots of time with and share a deep bond with.
