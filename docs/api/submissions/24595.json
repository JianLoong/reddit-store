You upheld a cherished family tradition, especially at the request of a sick child, while still going out of your way to provide a safe alternative for Ella. You considered everyone's needs and made an effort to be accommodating. Matt's reaction seemed really strong, but it's important to remember that including someone doesn't mean sacrificing important family customs. It sounds like you navigated a tricky situation with care and thoughtfulness.", "\u201cMatt got angry and accused me of not accepting his girlfriend into the family and singling her out.\u201d\n\nYou made an entire second dish so she wouldn\u2019t be excluded. It doesn\u2019t get more accepting and welcoming than that. He\u2019s got this completely the wrong way around.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n> not accepting his girlfriend into the family and singling her out.\n\nThis is not what happened. You made sure **_everyone_** had soup they could enjoy.", "NTA.\n\nMatt over-reacted.  What was he trying to do?  Act like a manly man in front of his girlfriend?", "NTA... you respectfully made something of her and took proper precautions to prevent her from having an allergic reaction... your son could have had some of the soup to not to make her feel left out.", "NTA you made two dishes and made sure to not contaminate. The same thing would have been done in a restaurant that serves seafood.", "NTA. It was very thoughtful of you to make a different soup for her. I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole, you were just taking care of your child, which naturally comes first.\n\nI think it would\u2019ve been a good idea for you have explained the tradition in advance in order to find out how allergic she is or to give Matt and his girlfriend the opportunity to tell you if they wanted to eat somewhere else for the night to be safe. \n\nbut it also seems that Matt reacted over the top, it\u2019s not like you were trying to kill her. If I were Ella, I would have felt embarrassed and singled out.", "NTA, you made her a separate soup, so she feels included. Matt is causing a conflict where there was no reason for one.", "NTA.   Matt needs to take a chill pill.", "NTA, you're not \"singling her out\" in a bad way, you are accommodating her. You made a substitute she could eat that was relatively similar to what everyone else was eating.\n\nSingling her out would be \"This is our tradition, we're eating fish soup, Ella you can order pizza\".", "NTA - There is a difference between accepting someone into the family and letting the newcomer dictate a change family traditions and practices.\n\nUnless the allergy is sever, to where cooking in the same kitchen is a risk, there is nothing wrong with you treating your 11 yr. old's illness as you've done others. You say you don't know how severe the allergy, but no mention before or after the cooking suggests cooking fish that isn't eaten triggers it. (Your son sounds like he would have used that to emphasise how bad a person you are.)", "NTA - you were sweet enough to make a dish specifically for your guest respecting her and her allergies. She made it awkward. I wish my MIL was like you <3", "NTA. You made accommodations for everyone. Assuming there's no cross contamination, good hosting here.", "NTA you made an additional dish basically just for her, making sure there was No cross contamination. \n\nThat\u2019s both just being a good host making sure your guest have a suitable meal and very kind and considerate.\n\nYou did Not single her out, your sons complaining and accusations did that.", "NTA, it was kind of you to make a separate dish for her. But she is a guest in your house and she doesn't get to dictate what you cook or what the rest of the family can eat.", "NTA.  It sounds like you went to a lot of trouble to accommodate her - your son and his girlfriend were very rude.  So she has an allergy - she can't eat seafood.  Well fine - but the rest of the world doesn't have to stop eating it because of her - that is some serious main character energy........", "NTA. You made chicken soup for her. You also took extra precautions to not contaminate it in anyway.", "NTA \n\nYou son should know family traditions and accept that his sibling wanted something special when they were I\u2019ll. You went above and beyond to accommodate his girlfriend. He needs to apologize or gtfo.", "NTA. It\u2019s not reasonable for her to expect that nobody eats her allergenic food as your adult guest.   Especially an important traditional food. I mean you can\u2019t even expect that at a restaurant and you pay for it! \nNext time give them a heads up so they can make their restaurant plans ahead of time instead of having a tantrum at your table after you made a beautiful meal.", "NTA. You prepared two options to accommodate her. You made the fish soup for your child that was sick.\n\nElla is a girlfriend not yet a family member and I am surprised she is acting like this.  The problem seems to stem from Matt though, he definitely overreacted. Is she his first girlfriend? Perhaps this multiple week visit has gone on long enough.\n\nThey both owe you an apology for their actions. If you don't get one, especially from Ella, this visit has definitely gone on too long.", "you went out of your way to make dinner especially for her, and you got yelled at and then they went to a restaurant? since this isn\u2019t the first issue you\u2019ve had with the two of them, i\u2019d suggest they go back to the dorms (or wherever, honestly) and make their own dinners. nta.", "NTA. You made a second soup that Ella could eat. So unless her seafood allergy is triggered by airborne elements, you accommodated both her allergy and your ill son\u2019s craving. How was that singling her out?", "How allergic is allergic. Personally i think while it's kind of you to make her chicken noddle soup, I'd argue it wasn't a good idea to make something you know one of your guests is allergic too. \n\nYour son is being dramatic, but I'd argue this is a safety issue more than anything.", "honestly it depends on how severely allergic she is.", "Info- did you ask how allergic she is? Shellfish can be a mild or EXTREME allergy and if it's extreme you would be the a-hole for cooking food that could kill her along with the food you serve her (unless you are thoroughly washing your hands and all surfaces involved and have enough space to keep the two soups FAR, FAW AWAY from each other so that you could ensure there was NO chance of contamination). If you asked and it's mild and you took appropriate measures then you're mostly in the clear, but I personally still wouldn't have cooked it. As someone who has dealt with food allergies people really don't understand how easy cross contamination is. Also your son is old enough to be told that your other son's gf is allergic so maybe the soup isn't a great idea. \n\nEdit: after reading comments I see you didn't inquire further about the allergy before cooking. ESH, son's gf for not being very specific about her allergy and you for not making sure that cooking fish wouldn't kill your son's gf. This should answer your question, if she had died from you cooking the soup and her being exposed to it and thus developing anaphylaxis and suffocating, which was a possibility as you didn't check, would you feel at fault? Would you feel bad? If a guest tells me they're allergic to peanuts I'm not gonna make peanut sauce to use for stir fry and then also make general tsos to serve them because I'm not gonna put their life at risk for some peanut sauce.", "NTA. They are both 21 years old. They can figure out their own damn meals if what you\u2019ve prepared doesn\u2019t work for them. Stop catering to either of them at all. When you tried to be nice and make a separate meal for her, they were rude and ungrateful. They\u2019ve shown you who they are. Believe them. Also, I have a shell fish allergy and when my husband & kids eat shrimp for dinner (which my husband prepares and cleans up, I can\u2019t even touch it) I make myself something else or order in.

It was so kind of you to make something for her in addition to what you were making for your family. This behavior is unbelievably entitled.", "Info this kinda depends on allergy. I have family members where this would have been enough to send them into anaphylactic shock.", "Im wondering if Matts anger stems from the fact he couldn't eat the soup he loved  if he was planning on kissing the girlfriend at any point........", "not only that, but he made two soups for everyone and they could choose which they want.

He didn\u2019t have to throw a fit.", "And you didn't think to inquire more because.....?", "why would she inquire more?  Her guest said she can't eat fish, so OP made a similar dish but without fish.  How are you possibly trying to blame OP in this situation?", "It was an oversight. I try not pry and no more information was offered.", "It's a good idea to know if the thing you're cooking is going to make your guest unable to breathe from the smell.", "Then I'll go with ESH some allergies are fatal, some are uncomfortable. As the host you should have errored on the side of caution, as the guest and one with the allergy she should have been explicit in how much accomadation she needed", "I would say this is the one time to pry to make sure you don't kill your guest.", "idk if I was unable to breath from the smell of something I would probably mention that myself instead of waiting for someone to ask. Most people without allergies don't really know how bad they can be.  \n\nIf you have an allergy that extreme it's your responsibility to make sure you don't die at a random dinner party.", "This. Allergies have a very wide range of seriousness, sometimes as long as they don't actually eat the thing they're fine but sometimes even being in the same room as the allergen can cause a reaction and it can be life threatening.", "She doesn't have to pry. The girlfriend said she couldn't eat fish, so OP didn't make her fish.", "Call me weird but I don't like the idea of my cooking killing people.", "Yep. Like is everyone else touching the water pitcher going to make her sick? It's important ot know.", "Just having it in the same space can be enough to trigger a severe allergy. Same with storing cooked food nearby. Asking more questions would make it clear if that\u2019s the case here.", "If your allergy is that bad you need to make that clear to people and not wait for them to ask you.", "She said she\u2019s \u201cvery allergic.\u201d That tends to imply no seafood around her unless asked and told it\u2019s okay.", "Again, if you can't be around something at all, you need to make that clear for exactly these situations. \n\nWhat *does* very allergic mean? Some people could die from a small amount of contact and some people could get severely sick if ingested. Which one is \"very\" allergic?", "Wait, if you made her a separate dish that she was not allergic to, what\u2019s the issue?

That was great acceptance", "Totally........", "NTA. If Matt thought you were going to go without fish while Ella was visiting he needed to have that conversation with you before bringing her to stay. This is on him for assuming there would be no fish in the house", "NTA.", "NTA you cooked two soups to accommodate her and he could have eaten it with her so she felt included.", "NTA\n\nYou had a safe option for her.", "NTA! He sounds ungrateful! He's staying with you with another person for 2 weeks at least and I bet you're cooking every meal...\n21 year olds can be a little selfish though... that's part of life! Hopefully he'll grow out of it.", "Nta.", "NTA obviously. You're way too kind and they kind of spat in your face?", "I say nta, but I do have to ask was there any chance of cross contamination? I could understand why the gf felt uncomfortable about eating the chicken soup", "Like honestly Opie is NTA for sure because in other post on this subreddit people don't accommodate other people's food preferences or allergies but Opie definitely went above and beyond to accommodate her oldest son's girlfriend and it is not her fault that her family would prefer fish soup over chicken soup. Honestly Matt needs to take a chill pill and understand that not everyone wants to sacrifice their Traditions so quickly", "And I wouldn't like dying because I didn't mention to a person I was staying with that I can't even be in the vicinity of specific food items being cooked.\n\nI have a cousin who has an allergy to fish and can't be in the house when it's being cooked. He makes sure that everyone knows about that when the topic comes up, and we don't cook fish when he's around or will be coming around in the near future. I have another relative that is allergic to one type of fish specifically and the issue is only with eating it. So there have been tons of times where everyone else was eating that fish but another type of fish was cooked for him (his is cooked first to avoid cross contamination obviously). \n\nI think OP did what was necessary in asking about allergies.  Beyond that, if it's a serious/anaphylactic allergy it's on the person with the allergy(or the parent/guardian of in the case of children) to specify the severity, and ideally give a run down of what could happen and what to do just in case."]}
