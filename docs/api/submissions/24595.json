You made sure **_everyone_** had soup they could enjoy.", "NTA.\n\nMatt over-reacted.  What was he trying to do?  Act like a manly man in front of his girlfriend?", "NTA... you respectfully made something of her and took proper precautions to prevent her from having an allergic reaction... your son could have had some of the soup to not to make her feel left out.", "NTA you made two dishes and made sure to not contaminate. The same thing would have been done in a restaurant that serves seafood.", "NTA. It was very thoughtful of you to make a different soup for her. I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole, you were just taking care of your child, which naturally comes first.\n\nI think it would\u2019ve been a good idea for you have explained the tradition in advance in order to find out how allergic she is or to give Matt and his girlfriend the opportunity to tell you if they wanted to eat somewhere else for the night to be safe. \n\nbut it also seems that Matt reacted over the top, it\u2019s not like you were trying to kill her. If I were Ella, I would have felt embarrassed and singled out.", "NTA, you made her a separate soup, so she feels included. Matt is causing a conflict where there was no reason for one.", "NTA.   Matt needs to take a chill pill.", "NTA, you're not \"singling her out\" in a bad way, you are accommodating her. You made a substitute she could eat that was relatively similar to what everyone else was eating.\n\nSingling her out would be \"This is our tradition, we're eating fish soup, Ella you can order pizza\".", "NTA - There is a difference between accepting someone into the family and letting the newcomer dictate a change family traditions and practices.\n\nUnless the allergy is sever, to where cooking in the same kitchen is a risk, there is nothing wrong with you treating your 11 yr. old's illness as you've done others. You say you don't know how severe the allergy, but no mention before or after the cooking suggests cooking fish that isn't eaten triggers it. (Your son sounds like he would have used that to emphasise how bad a person you are.)", "NTA - you were sweet enough to make a dish specifically for your guest respecting her and her allergies. She made it awkward. I wish my MIL was like you <3", "NTA. You made accommodations for everyone. Assuming there's no cross contamination, good hosting here.", "NTA you made an additional dish basically just for her, making sure there was No cross contamination. \n\nThat\u2019s both just being a good host making sure your guest have a suitable meal and very kind and considerate.\n\nYou did Not single her out, your sons complaining and accusations did that.", "NTA, it was kind of you to make a separate dish for her. But she is a guest in your house and she doesn't get to dictate what you cook or what the rest of the family can eat.", "NTA.  It sounds like you went to a lot of trouble to accommodate her - your son and his girlfriend were very rude.  So she has an allergy - she can't eat seafood.  Well fine - but the rest of the world doesn't have to stop eating it because of her - that is some serious main character energy........", "NTA. You made chicken soup for her. You also took extra precautions to not contaminate it in anyway.", "NTA \n\nYou son should know family traditions and accept that his sibling wanted something special when they were I\u2019ll. You went above and beyond to accommodate his girlfriend. He needs to apologize or gtfo.", "NTA. It\u2019s not reasonable for her to expect that nobody eats her allergenic food as your adult guest.   Especially an important traditional food. I mean you can\u2019t even expect that at a restaurant and you pay for it! \nNext time give them a heads up so they can make their restaurant plans ahead of time instead of having a tantrum at your table after you made a beautiful meal.", "NTA. You prepared two options to accommodate her. You made the fish soup for your child that was sick.\n\nElla is a girlfriend not yet a family member and I am surprised she is acting like this.  The problem seems to stem from Matt though, he definitely overreacted. Is she his first girlfriend? Perhaps this multiple week visit has gone on long enough.\n\nThey both owe you an apology for their actions. If you don't get one, especially from Ella, this visit has definitely gone on too long.", "you went out of your way to make dinner especially for her, and you got yelled at and then they went to a restaurant? since this isn\u2019t the first issue you\u2019ve had with the two of them, i\u2019d suggest they go back to the dorms (or wherever, honestly) and make their own dinners. nta.", "NTA. You made a second soup that Ella could eat. So unless her seafood allergy is triggered by airborne elements, you accommodated both her allergy and your ill son\u2019s craving. How was that singling her out?", "How allergic is allergic. Personally i think while it's kind of you to make her chicken noddle soup, I'd argue it wasn't a good idea to make something you know one of your guests is allergic too. \n\nYour son is being dramatic, but I'd argue this is a safety issue more than anything.", "honestly it depends on how severely allergic she is.", "Info- did you ask how allergic she is? Shellfish can be a mild or EXTREME allergy and if it's extreme you would be the a-hole for cooking food that could kill her along with the food you serve her (unless you are thoroughly washing your hands and all surfaces involved and have enough space to keep the two soups FAR, FAW AWAY from each other so that you could ensure there was NO chance of contamination). If you asked and it's mild and you took appropriate measures then you're mostly in the clear, but I personally still wouldn't have cooked it. As someone who has dealt with food allergies people really don't understand how easy cross contamination is. Also your son is old enough to be told that your other son's gf is allergic so maybe the soup isn't a great idea. \n\nEdit: after reading comments I see you didn't inquire further about the allergy before cooking. ESH, son's gf for not being very specific about her allergy and you for not making sure that cooking fish wouldn't kill your son's gf. This should answer your question, if she had died from you cooking the soup and her being exposed to it and thus developing anaphylaxis and suffocating, which was a possibility as you didn't check, would you feel at fault? Would you feel bad? If a guest tells me they're allergic to peanuts I'm not gonna make peanut sauce to use for stir fry and then also make general tsos to serve them because I'm not gonna put their life at risk for some peanut sauce.", "NTA. They are both 21 years old. They can figure out their own damn meals if what you\u2019ve prepared doesn\u2019t work for them. Stop catering to either of them at all. When you tried to be nice and make a separate meal for her, they were rude and ungrateful. They\u2019ve shown you who they are. Believe them. Also, I have a shell fish allergy and when my husband & kids eat shrimp for dinner (which my husband prepares and cleans up, I can\u2019t even touch it) I make myself something else or order in.

He makes sure that everyone knows about that when the topic comes up, and we don't cook fish when he's around or will be coming around in the near future. I have another relative that is allergic to one type of fish specifically and the issue is only with eating it. So there have been tons of times where everyone else was eating that fish but another type of fish was cooked for him (his is cooked first to avoid cross contamination obviously). \n\nI think OP did what was necessary in asking about allergies.  Beyond that, if it's a serious/anaphylactic allergy it's on the person with the allergy(or the parent/guardian of in the case of children) to specify the severity, and ideally give a run down of what could happen and what to do just in case.", "INFO: did Matt and Ella know you'd be making fish soup in advance?\n\nIt honestly depends on the allergy.

Clearly we don\u2019t have to stop eating this relative\u2019s allergens but if we are in the same living spaces we can\u2019t eat some of them while relative is there. This isn\u2019t \u201cmain character syndrome\u201d, it\u2019s common sense because calling an ambulance and using an epipen sucks, even if you ignore the potential for dying.

Matt acts entitled and while he is an adult, he might need some more parenting in terms of learning to appreciate how much work cooking is. \n\nOption 1: If he chooses to stay with you, he is responsible for cooking a fresh meal for your whole family once a week. He has to plan, buy ingredients and actually prepare/ cook the meal, no fast food/ take out/ ready mades, has to stick to a budget. He can ask for advice, but only in a \"is this or that the better solution\" way. (Don't worry about that Option being too harsh, my mom made me cook all meals for 8 people for 4 weeks between graduating and college, learnt tons about cooking, planning and appreciating complex meals...actually recommend that approach to all parents)\n\nOption 2: He doesn't get to eat family meals prepared by you anymore. He can cook for himself and his girlfriend or they can eat a sandwich. Their cooked meals aren't your problem anymore.\n\n\nThe only scenario I would somewhat understand the reaction is if Ella is so severely allergic that she risks a serious reaction even from being close to seafood, like airborne particles or a hint of seafood in the chicken soup.
