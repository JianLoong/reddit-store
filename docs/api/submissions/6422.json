{"id": 6422, "submission_id": "102n0bs", "title": "AITA For Telling My Mother That I Love Her But Don't Like Her?", "selftext": "My (16f) mother (40sf) read in some parenting book that saying to your child \"I love you but I don't like you\" is a good way to discipline them. I don't necessarily agree with that parenting book because, as a child, I viewed my mother liking me and loving me as the same. I used to have pretty bad attachment anxiety and would cry whenever she left me alone, and she would get tired of me and tell me \"Stop crying. When you act like this, I love you but don't like you\" then she would be cold with me for the rest of the day. As far as I was concerned, what did it matter if she loved me if she refused to talk to me because she disliked me so much?\n\nAnyway, that's just backstory. The main crux of my issue is that my mother was playing with my younger brothers (5m and 2m) and the 5 year old asked why I wasn't playing. I had just returned from school and walked in right to hear his question, and my mother responding, \"I don't think your sister loves me the way that you two do.\" \n\nI didn't realize it until that moment, but I had been mentally preparing to use my mother's statement back to her for my entire life. I responded, \"Mom, of corse I love you, but I don't like you.\" Then I remembered why I've never used that phrase: my mother got really angry at me. She got up and went to her bedroom, and then she's been very cold with me the rest of the day. The only thing she's said to me is she told me to not tell my father about any of this, because, if he hears, he'll get angry at both of us for fighting and will just cause a bigger scene. \n\nI really feel badly for my brothers because they were confused. Apparently my mother's never used that term on them? They were also upset because the play session got cut short, and I feel badly because I could have just been nicer to my mother.

Your NTA", "NTA. \n\nWell, well, well. If it isn't the consequences of own actions. \n\nI will also say, what a fucking horribly cruel thing to say to your child. OP, I think you *should* tell your father, if there's a good relationship there. I'd be willing to bet that your mom is actually worried that he'll call her for being the asshole she is, saying shit like that to her own kid. WTF????\n\nSpeaking as someone in this position, I would not be surprised if a few years down the line you decide to cut down on contact with her. She doesn't sound like the best person to be around.", "Well, NTA.\n\nThere isn't enough information here to really understand the root cause (and this is AITA, not family therapy) but I feel there's a lot your mother could do differently.  Assuming you have some kind of loving relationship with your father, you should certainly tell him IMHO; maintaining secrets in the house might allow your mother to avoid confronting the problem for a bit, but it's not going to help you.", "This is a tough one, but I\u2019m going to go with NTA. Your mother used that phrase with you and, while I can certainly see *the philosophy behind it*, I can also see why that would be deeply upsetting and confusing for a child. \n\nShe really was asking for a fight when she told your younger siblings that you don\u2019t love her like they do\u2026 what does that even mean? What was her reasoning for saying that? That is just\u2026 nasty? Unnecessary?", "So she used to say it to you, and then flew off the handle when you said it back? NTA for this and also for if you decide to go no-contact in the future! I think that's a horrible thing to say to a child and I hope now she knows how it feels", "Definitely NTA\n\nWhen your mother goes cold on you when you do something she doesn\u2019t like, that is a form of emotional abuse. It is also emotional abuse when she makes comments like the one she did to your brothers in the first place. She doesn\u2019t want you to tell your dad because this might have been something he has spoken to her about in the past. But you are not responsible for protecting your mother from the potential consequences of her own actions. \n\nIt\u2019s important you learn to recognize this now so that you can learn how to cope with it. You will be an adult soon and emotional abuse is everywhere. If you can identify it you can protect yourself from remaining in relationships or friendships in the future where people treat you this way. It\u2019s really hard to accept that our parents aren\u2019t perfect and that they may have not treated us the way we deserve to be treated. I\u2019m sorry. It is fair for her to be hurt by what you said but that hurt comes from shame and she should feel ashamed for withdrawing affection from her child when her child misbehaves- because that is abusive.", "Man this is a tricky one. I\u2019ll say NTA.\n\nOn one hand I think you heard something you weren\u2019t intended to.\n\nOn the other, I think your mom always knew you didn\u2019t like her. But hasn\u2019t had it reinforced by you telling her.", "NTA.  I'm glad you finally gave it back to her.  who writes these dumb ass parenting books anyway?  Sounds like some \"Dr.\" Phil shit.", "NTA\n\nShe set up the circumstances, now she's enjoying the consequences of her words and actions.", "NTA\n\nYour father would have no cause to be angry at you, because you didn't fight at all. You just calmly said the same thing to your mother that she said repeatedly to you as a child. If she can't take it now as an adult, imagine the hurt about saying it again and again to a kid! I hate that phrase, and any parenting book that argues for it is rubbish. I'm glad it sounds like your mom isn't using the phrase for your brothers, but if she recognizes now that it sucks, then she needs to be an adult and apologize to you.", "NTA. Speaking as a mom, it's painful when one of my kids claps back with something passive-aggressive they've heard from me. But it's my job as a parent to model good conflict resolution, patience, and compassion. If your mom is unable or unwilling to change, at least maybe you can learn from this experience.", "NTA", "NTA.  Consequences happen\u2014it just took your mom a while.", "If I were you, I would go further to make my point across by replying with \"and that's why I don't like you.\"", "NTA but I really really think you need to tell your dad. She\u2019s trying to make it seem like he\u2019ll be mad at both of you to guilt you but she knows he\u2019ll just be mad at her. Please tell him. Away from her of course.", "NTA\nYour mom can dish it out but can't take it? Color me surprised.", "I bet if you go talk to her and clarify that you are just saying to her what she said to her, she\u2019ll probably say I didn\u2019t say that. Honestly though, you\u2019ve been carrying this so long, it\u2019s time to tell her anyway. Tell her those words hurt.", "I have had the same issue happen to me alot aswell it has come to a point where my mother's will is law and if it doesn't go by that she just gets mad and anything she does is a go and anything I do (exactly the same thing she did) she gets mad about. Point Is you aren't the asshole for doing what you did but her being 'a mom' just can't take it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While it sucks your brothers were affected, this gives me so many res flags that I think are bigger then that. \n\nHow is your relationship with your dad? Was he ever around when she said that to you in the past? No need to actually reply. But if your comfortable opening up to your dad, and you realized he wasn't around when she said that before, you should absolutely tell him all about it. It really sounds like he has no clue and wouldn't like that your mom had said that.
