Assuming you have some kind of loving relationship with your father, you should certainly tell him IMHO; maintaining secrets in the house might allow your mother to avoid confronting the problem for a bit, but it's not going to help you.", "This is a tough one, but I\u2019m going to go with NTA. Your mother used that phrase with you and, while I can certainly see *the philosophy behind it*, I can also see why that would be deeply upsetting and confusing for a child. \n\nShe really was asking for a fight when she told your younger siblings that you don\u2019t love her like they do\u2026 what does that even mean?

NTA for this and also for if you decide to go no-contact in the future! I think that's a horrible thing to say to a child and I hope now she knows how it feels", "Definitely NTA\n\nWhen your mother goes cold on you when you do something she doesn\u2019t like, that is a form of emotional abuse. It is also emotional abuse when she makes comments like the one she did to your brothers in the first place. She doesn\u2019t want you to tell your dad because this might have been something he has spoken to her about in the past. But you are not responsible for protecting your mother from the potential consequences of her own actions. \n\nIt\u2019s important you learn to recognize this now so that you can learn how to cope with it. You will be an adult soon and emotional abuse is everywhere. If you can identify it you can protect yourself from remaining in relationships or friendships in the future where people treat you this way. It\u2019s really hard to accept that our parents aren\u2019t perfect and that they may have not treated us the way we deserve to be treated. I\u2019m sorry. It is fair for her to be hurt by what you said but that hurt comes from shame and she should feel ashamed for withdrawing affection from her child when her child misbehaves- because that is abusive.", "Man this is a tricky one. I\u2019ll say NTA.\n\nOn one hand I think you heard something you weren\u2019t intended to.\n\nOn the other, I think your mom always knew you didn\u2019t like her.

Sounds like some \"Dr.\" Phil shit.", "NTA\n\nShe set up the circumstances, now she's enjoying the consequences of her words and actions.", "NTA\n\nYour father would have no cause to be angry at you, because you didn't fight at all. You just calmly said the same thing to your mother that she said repeatedly to you as a child. If she can't take it now as an adult, imagine the hurt about saying it again and again to a kid! I hate that phrase, and any parenting book that argues for it is rubbish. I'm glad it sounds like your mom isn't using the phrase for your brothers, but if she recognizes now that it sucks, then she needs to be an adult and apologize to you.", "NTA. Speaking as a mom, it's painful when one of my kids claps back with something passive-aggressive they've heard from me.

She would drop everything and take off so I could calm down because I hated yelling at her but she knew that we would have a conversation when I came for her. What your mom did was so damaging because love and like are the same to a child. The fact that she gets cold and angry and does not speak to you seems like a punishment to me and not a constructive one because she is not giving herself time to calm down she is guilting you for her behaviors.
