Your mother used that phrase with you and, while I can certainly see *the philosophy behind it*, I can also see why that would be deeply upsetting and confusing for a child. \n\nShe really was asking for a fight when she told your younger siblings that you don\u2019t love her like they do\u2026 what does that even mean?

I think that's a horrible thing to say to a child and I hope now she knows how it feels", "Definitely NTA\n\nWhen your mother goes cold on you when you do something she doesn\u2019t like, that is a form of emotional abuse. It is also emotional abuse when she makes comments like the one she did to your brothers in the first place.

But you are not responsible for protecting your mother from the potential consequences of her own actions. \n\nIt\u2019s important you learn to recognize this now so that you can learn how to cope with it. You will be an adult soon and emotional abuse is everywhere. If you can identify it you can protect yourself from remaining in relationships or friendships in the future where people treat you this way. It\u2019s really hard to accept that our parents aren\u2019t perfect and that they may have not treated us the way we deserve to be treated. I\u2019m sorry.

You just calmly said the same thing to your mother that she said repeatedly to you as a child. If she can't take it now as an adult, imagine the hurt about saying it again and again to a kid! I hate that phrase, and any parenting book that argues for it is rubbish. I'm glad it sounds like your mom isn't using the phrase for your brothers, but if she recognizes now that it sucks, then she needs to be an adult and apologize to you.", "NTA. Speaking as a mom, it's painful when one of my kids claps back with something passive-aggressive they've heard from me.

What your mom did was so damaging because love and like are the same to a child. The fact that she gets cold and angry and does not speak to you seems like a punishment to me and not a constructive one because she is not giving herself time to calm down she is guilting you for her behaviors.

When you were younger, it sounds like she said a specific action of yours made her like you less. Plenty of parents might say that in a gentle way and with a hug, but saying those words and treating you coldly afterwards, would have taken things to an extreme and made you feel unloved and potentially emotionally abandoned. Your mom might be one of those people that always walks away from uncomfortable behaviour or conflict because of her personality type, which is frustrating, but can also feel hurtful.\n\nYou saying you just don\u2019t like her, period, in front of your brothers, would also have been extremely hurtful and embarrassing. So she walked away again. There was no qualification in your statement - it sounded like you meant to say you don\u2019t like any part of her at all. That would hurt anyone, especially your parent, so you achieved your aim of hurting her with words.\n\nParents and their kids mess up all the time. Families are messy, because we are human and we feel close enough to say things to each other than we wouldn\u2019t say to others. If you want to repair your relationship with your mum, try talking it out to explain why you said what you said and how those words and associated actions made you feel when you were younger. That probably makes it harder for you to watch her doting on your younger siblings too. There are likely lots of other things you might have to talk about that aren\u2019t in the post, but just approach it with compassion for both your sakes. We aren\u2019t cartoon characters: there is no need for your mom or you to be cast as either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d. So, any conversation needs to recognise we can all be flawed and that is ok as long as we try to do better next time. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve found that when you have one much older child, you\u2019re more relaxed with the younger ones and a more confident parent. You give them more time and a more mature response, because you have it and they need more from you. But your older child is always special, even when there are things you could have done better when bringing them up. \n\nYour mom may be embarrassed for your dad to know what you think of her.

And yes, do tell your father about her verbal abuse - I'm sure he doesn't know about her doing it to you.", "NTA please do tell your dad everything, ask for therapy about it,  tell him how your mother's behaviour towards you affects you, that everything she used the phrase she was cold towards you for the rest of the day. That she told your siings that you don't love her like they do and she has never told them she doesn't like them.  The fact she wants to hide this is a red flag.  The fact she treats her male children differently is a red flag, this points to more going on and you will likely need support working through it.", "Please elaborate on that \u201ephilosophy behind it\u201c part.", "The person who wrote that book had to take that psychological concept so incredibly out of context. You tell your kid you love them to reassure them that you\u2019re not abandoning them, then you go into how you\u2019re upset with them and how they\u2019re hurting you. It\u2019s okay not to like your kid at the moment since we have a complex understanding of liking and loving people, but children don\u2019t have that complexity to understand what you mean when you say you love them but you don\u2019t like them, so I think it\u2019s ridiculous that anybody ever thought it was okay to say that to a child.", "I was taught in the form should be: \"I love you, *AND*...\"\nI stay left of the \"but\" and the \"and\" makes the statements declarative and separate.", "Your mother doesn't want your dad to know because he has been on her about this for years.

Nope, the reason why she asked you not to tell your father about this fight is because she just realised what the effect of her favorite sentence is and she doesn't want your father to know how she has treated you your entire childhood.", "NTA.

Your mom has cherry picked the parts that allow her to be abusive", "Are you sure your father knew about her saying such crap to you? It's awfully telling that she doesn't want you to tell him.", "Your mother wants the secrecy because it benefits her.

Not only did your mom use the whole I love you phrase wrong ( it\u2019s not supposed to be but I don\u2019t like you; you don\u2019t like the behavior is what it was intended to be), but it sounds like she had some other parenting fails based on your descriptions.  Being cold and ignoring your child isn\u2019t ok. And her indifference to your crying makes my heart break for you.  There\u2019s definitely something missing or that you\u2019re not aware of since she didn\u2019t want your dad to know what went down.

She knows her actions have permanently damaged the relationship with her eldest child and she's afraid OP doesn't love her because of it. So she's trying to make up for that by strengthening her bond to the younger siblings by badmouthing the oldest. I bet the father doesn't know about what mom has been saying to OP all these years and he'd be livid if he found out. That's why she told OP to keep quiet and that's why she left the room rather than fly off her handle and make a scene.

I think the response is a cruel statement as it is but in your situation I go with NTA. Your mother has normalized this statement and it very telling that she reacts as she does when she gets it served herself, obviously she finds it terrible to hear too. What I find weird is her reasoning why you shouldn't your father. Has ever used this statement on you too? Does he know she used it? On a side note her saying you never loved her like the boys do is also kinda toxic and actually the other way around seems more true", "NTA sick burn, she deserves it. She's at least being manipulative and at worst she's been emotionally abusive. I do wonder how your dad would actually react. Does she fear you telling him because he would take your side?", "NTA. k______ is a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch!", "NTA it sounds like Mom doesn't want you to tell dad because he probably was against her using that language all along.", "NTA.

You deserve better.", "Noooo tell your dad.  She's trying to hide that SHE was a complete asshole.  It's SO FREAKING damaging to create the storyline with your very small impressionable brothers that you somehow don't love her as much and it needs to be nipped in the bud ASAP.  Also, what's good for the goose lol...a lot of parents don't realize they aren't \"raising children\" they are raising children to be ADULTS and their actions ABSOLUTELY have consequences once those children grown up.  She taught you that that phrase was ok to use by using it on you, it's now fair game.   NTA, please tell your dad.  Someone needs to check her and he (as the other legal adult in the house) should be the one doing it.", "NTA tell you dad, I bet he told her previously not to say such things or it\u2019ll bite her in the ass.

She said that to me twice.  Oh yeah....I was 15.  Def NTA.  Parents shouldn't say things like this to their kids.  I'm pushing 40 and I can still hear her saying that to me.  Its something I will never forget.", "you can see the philosophy behind telling your children you dislike them?", "It's emotional manipulation. Her mom knew she got home and said that. My step mom used this tactic to divide the kids against each other.", "Though. I' m sorry but this is not \"though\". She was telling her child that she doesn't like her, and then neglect her and be cold toward her. But than she doesn't do the same with her other two child.

Hun, try to look into therapy if you can, because this is not healthy at all.", "um\u2026.no. OP being mean to her mother who is consistently mean to her does not make her cruel. your last paragraph is also weird, she has had \u201cpractice at being a better human\u201d but is STILL taking jabs at OP. its obviously not her brothers fault, and she understands that. she even said she felt bad because she confused her brothers and made them upset.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like my ex-mom. I refer to her as my ex mom because she was abusive and I am NC with her.\n\nStart figuring out a way to move out when you turn 18.

Like your older child being abusive towards you or is doing really bad things like stealing all the heirloom jewelry to sell for drug money where they have become someone you don\u2019t like, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love them.  You can not like them and not want to be around them and not be willing to have them in your house, but it still doesn\u2019t break the bond of parent and child.\n\nIt\u2019s not suppose to be a frequent punishment used for minor infractions.", "A life tip that OP should have been taught at a much younger age, but should learn now: when an adult hurts you in some way and tells you not to tell someone else, especially if that person is your parent, you should absolutely tell someone. That indicates they're trying to hide their actions because they know it was a bad thing to do and will make them look bad to others", "The way I use it is \u201cI love you very much. I do not want to play legos with you right now because you just threw a stuffed dog at my head. That hurt my feelings and I need to take a minute. That was not a nice thing to do. I love you, see you in five minutes.\u201d \n\nMy kid can be an asshole sometimes, as can everyone. That doesn\u2019t make me love her any less, it just means I need a few things. \n\n1) understand that I love her and there is nothing she could do to change that.

This also means teaching them what parts of other people\u2019s responses are their responsibility. My child is responsible for throwing a toy at my head, and hurting my feelings. She is responsible for apologizing for her actions and asking how she can help. (Grab an ice pack, help mop up, whatever is age appropriate and related to her actions.) She is not responsible for regulating my emotions. She is responsible for letting me do that for myself. She doesn\u2019t have to fix my hurt feelings, she does have to let me take a moment to fix them myself.", "My husband's grandparents (British) said to him when he was a kid, \"I don't like you\" when he was misbehaving (or even just doing something the GPs didn't like).\n\nHe thought that was OK until he repeated it to my friend who was a teacher and had her kids early on (eg more experienced) and she said \"you never tell a child you don't like them; you tell them you don't like what they are doing at the moment.\"\n\nIt was a lightbulb moment for him.
