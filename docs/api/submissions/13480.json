As a reformed late person who is basically almost never late now, I'm obviously sympathetic from the get-go, but holy shit, your \"friends\" are such assholes.  \n\nOne thing I've noticed is that even though I've been good about being on time for literally like over 6 years, nobody notices.  The narrative is always \"Oh you know hereforlulz, she's always late\" or \"Wow, I can't believe you're on time.\"  I HAVE BEEN ON TIME FOR YEARS!  But it's hard to get narratives like that to go away because people simply don't notice.\n\nI don't know what to tell you.

But that's me.", "This is a hard one but I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. One occasion of being 15 minutes late after 2 years of making a concerted effort to be on time seems like it\u2019s well within the bounds of reason. I also don\u2019t understand why your friends waited until you got there to get up and walk out- it seems like they were trying to teach you a lesson, but that seems really petty if you truly aren\u2019t consistently late anymore.", "From the description I would say NTA but how often do you have a \"genuine\" reason to be late? I can't imagine friends would be that pissed over something so small unless there is something you are telling us.", "NTA-you told them you were running late and not to wait for you to order. I think it's rude of them to all get up and leave like that.", "YTA likely.  In your post you say in the last 2 years you\u2019ve only been late due to unforeseen circumstances.  From the point of view of your friends it only looks like you haven\u2019t changed and continue to be late.  There is a reason, likely unconscious, that you continue to be late, regardless of the reasons why.  I have a friend who\u2019s always late and to be honest it\u2019s a power move.  He shows his dominance by making people wait, though he\u2019ll deny that all day long.  There are people who make excuses and people who get things done.  Your friends are tired of the excuses and don\u2019t feel like they should have to continually wait on you and I don\u2019t blame them.  Don\u2019t try to be on time.  Be on time.", "YTA. You were running late:\n\n>maybe 10 minutes behind schedule.\n\nThen, the next line:\n\n>hurried up and got to the place maybe 15 minutes late in total\n\nSo, by hurrying up you got an additional 5 minutes delay. \n\nMissing a train is probably something you call 'something like a delayed train'. \n\nThink hard and try to remember, how often were you the first to arrive at a meeting with your friends? How often were you the last? You should be in the first half of the people to arrive 50% of the time just to be average. How often are you? \n\nI recommend posting a link to this to your friends, and ask them for their side.", "YTA\n\nApparently you've been late enough times that they've had enough. I'm also left wondering what you've left out of your story that merits such a strong response. Did they say anything to you all those other times you were late?\n\nI am someone who is never late. I always give plenty of time to reach my destination. It's called respect for other people's time. They don't have to give it to you.", "NTA\n\n15 minutes isn't even that bad, and you let Friends know beforehand that you were running behind. Even then just up and bailing on you when you did show up was a pretty jerk thing to do.\n\nI think you should make time for some better friends.", "The problem is you don\u2019t see the issue with being late.  You can make any excuse you want, but the simple fact is you don\u2019t value the time of others.  You fkd around one too many times and now you found out.  YTA", "YTA - obviously they are done with you and only waited to say goodbye. There isn\u2019t a good era and bad era. They see you are late again and they are done.\n\nFind new friends.\n\nEdit: I also think you are being disingenuous if you say \u201cyou weren\u2019t late without a reason.\u201d Leave earlier.\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to think 10 minutes late matters. But you were 15 minutes late. How long would you stay and wait for someone when everyone else is there on time.\n\nI don\u2019t think you have solved your problem at all.", "NTA. In this particular case, you being late didn't really negatively affect them. I assume there were at least two of them, and they could have just ordered drinks and enjoyed a chat without your absence being a problem.\n\nMy guess is that they still view you as the person late to everything, despite the improvements you have made, and they wanted to send you a message that it was not okay with them.", "NTA\n\nYes it\u2019s rough to have someone trail into old habits, but that\u2019s clearly not what this is. To expect someone to be perfectly punctual every time is a bit silly. You also prefaced you would be late, which I think adds to you not being the AH. I\u2019m sorry that they got up and left, because you didn\u2019t deserve that at all. It seems they\u2019re hung up on it still if they were so apt for leaving in the manor that they did", "If your story is as written NTA.\n\nThis seems like a wild over reaction when you warned them. You were only 15 minutes late to a restaurant.  You told them to order without you. \n\nFor a reaction this big, it feels like you are missing parts of the story.", "ESH. Being late without extenuating circumstances is rude and disrespectful. But, then all leaving you was also rude and, frankly, uncalled for. You were all assholes.", "[deleted]", "ESH. Your friends were wrong to do this but it sounds like they have been burned by you many many times before and have finally reached the end of their collective rope.

Because if it's often, then your friends aren't seeing a difference.", "ESH if you are a \"reformed late person\" then you aren't late anymore.  You were late.  Your friends also suck", "NTA and never were. I'm always on time or early and i never understood why it could be a problem when someone is a bit late to casual things like drinks and dinner or something. Its freetime at least, no need to stress out being on time... and start drama over a few minutes. My bff is always late, last time to her own b-day party (1h) and guess what? Nobody was mad at all.

All that you can do when you're running late is communicate what is going on and get there as quickly (but safely) as you can. Sometimes circumstances like the  train running late, partner got home late to watch the kids, or terrible traffic just happens and you can't do much about it. \n\nI think it is very petty of the friend group to literally wait until you got there, then leave to go somewhere else without you. They are TA for doing that. \n\nI would question why they made the comment about \"being worth time,\" because running late doesn't seem to be potent enough to warrant that sort of reaction. Could there be other aspects of the friendship that impacted the situation and made this the last straw? \n\nIf the issue truly is just you running late, then NTA and your friends are definitely TA. You said yourself that they run late sometimes too, it's not fair to hold you to a higher standard than the rest of them.", "What happened to you, happens to everyone occasionally. The difference is, you have a reputation. As a previous poster said, people don\u2019t see all the times you have been on time once you have the reputation as someone who is always late. \nMy advice would be to send a message to everyone on the group either all at once or individually. Basically, tell them what you have told us. Give them a link to this post if you like and let them see what others have to say. \nMake sure you tell them how hard you have worked to make sure you have been on time for the past two years and that this one was just an honest slip up like everyone occasionally has. \nI don\u2019t know how close you are to this group but if they can\u2019t hear and accept that message, you may need to find a new group to hang with, where you don\u2019t already have a reputation. \nNTA", "Not often - Maybe once or twice in the whole time.

Are you late more often than everyone else? If so, you can\u2019t blame the trains.", "The other times I\u2019ve been late where because of stuff that was well out of my own control.

If you know that the trains are very unreliable, then you plan for that to be an emergency. Be a bit ahead. When you are a person who is known for being chronically late, and are only two years into fixing that, you need to be the one to plan for emergencies, not them. It is on you to fix, which means you need to work on trying to not only be on time, but in cases where you rely on public transportation you need to try and plan to be there early.\n\nI commend you for actually recognizing the problem and taking the steps to fix it, but ultimately when relying on public transportation taking the steps to just be on time is not always enough. It sucks, I have to rely on public transportation too. So I definitely get it. Having to rely on other people getting you to places is annoying, but when that's the case you have to plan for not only the best outcome but also the worst outcome ahead of time. Since you have failed to do that, you are the one at fault.

As i said i (personal) think there is no issue. And i think being on time in your freetime is overrated and i (for myself) can't see why someone wouldn't value me bc i had to wait a little.

They intentionally humiliated you in public because you were unintentionally 15 mins late. I would never do that to someone even if I were annoyed they were late. You also sent a text letting them know, which was courteous. My dad is frequently late.

For work, I try to schedule it so I'm taking one train before the one I need to - if I get to work early I just spend 20-30mns before my workday reading internet/writing blog or something nonwork.

Sooooo, we met, I arrive 10 minutes early sometimes more, she knows this, and she chronically arrives 15 min late. \nWhy? Because the Metro was 7 minutes instead of 3 min apart. \nWhy does she always forget that the metro runs every seven minutes instead of 7 on the weekends? Or she simply doesn't value my time?

Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019m going to say NAH, but I really think if you were being honest it\u2019s probably a YTA. I live in a city with VERY inconsistent public transit, so I often get places very early and just go for a walk or browse a nearby shop to kill time so I\u2019m not late.

I feel bad for your sister.", "Yikes, wasn't anticipating having to defend ADHD here but, telling someone with an executive-function disability to just \"find a way to be on time\" like it's actually that easy IS ableist, so congratulations.", "ADHD is a disability that impairs executive function. Working with occupational therapists and neuropsychiatrists might help someone cope and manage their symptoms better, but better tools to mitigate your disability's negative affects on your life don't actually erase it from existence.\n\n\"Just learn to not do that\" is such a callous, ableist remark.", "So you want OP to waste hours of their time just for the offchance that they might be late once a year because a train got delayed ?\n\nBe so fucking for real.", "...do you not have a life? Like who shows up an hour early to hanging out with friends because a train might make them 10 minutes late? That's ridiculous.", "I don\u2019t meet there friends by train. Tbh I don\u2019t know if any of them travel by train but it is a meme in our country that the trains are always late so you\u2019re usually met with understanding when you\u2019re late by train.\n\nI don\u2019t think I was a crying wolf? Obviously I\u2019m not the most objective person in this matter so take this with a grain of salt but I\u2019ve been always really honest with living up to my mistakes and saying \u201eI fucked up\u201c and own up to whatever fallout that might\u2019ve had. \n\nThe bad reputation is true tho. And I totally get that. The thing that really threw me off was simply the fact that we never mind waiting on somebody else if they are late. Even if it\u2019s 30 minutes + because we\u2019re just meeting up on our freetime and don\u2019t rely on one specific person being there if you know what I mean. \n\nI just thought their reaction was a bit over the top for what has actually happened. If they would\u2019ve just told me that they don\u2019t want to meet with me again I would\u2019ve been fine (hurt obv but fine overall) by that.", "They were late a few times as well. While we all try to be on time we do usually meet once a week so there have been moments for everyone where things just haven\u2019t worked out perfectly. (Eg getting of off work late, kid being fussy, traffic being bad) this was my first time beeing late with them tho. (After I\u2019ve changed obviously, but we only started meeting up this often in 2021 so it wasn\u2019t a regular occurrence back then)", "I don\u2019t think you understand what I mean by delayed. If it was like 20 - 30 minutes it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal. But their often multiple hours late or just don\u2019t drive at all. It\u2019s so bad it\u2019s basically a meme in my country by now.", "I don\u2019t really get what you\u2019re trying to say to me now? I texted on the group chat: \u201eSorry, running behind schedule rn. Might be 10 - 15 minutes late, trying my best tho. If you want you can order without me already, I\u2019ll try to be there asap\u201c a text everyone who\u2019s there could read. \n\nAnd as I mentioned already, the train times have been with my cousin, who I texted that they will be late and who simply waited a little longer to met me at the train station.", "That makes sense. \n\nBut OP has worked hard at not being late to things for a long time now and then one more slip up of only 15 minutes and their friends walk out on them, leaving them high and dry?(and fucking a waitress over in the process probably) \n\nThat's over the top.", "Sadly there isn\u2019t really an average delay here. I don\u2019t travel by train often tho, so it doesn\u2019t really matter. Trains are usually a bit late (which is obviously accountable) however trains have also been two to three hours late (which is not too rare sadly) and I hope we can all agree that that isn\u2019t really something I can plan for. However, as I said, I rarely ever travel by train for anything small and big events are obviously planned with enough time beforehand. But I cannot leave 3 hours early for a brunch just in case there\u2019s delay. (Just an example btw. I don\u2019t travel by train for these things)", "Yes I totally get that. I just wanted to point it out because I don\u2019t want anyone blamed for things they didn\u2019t do. Thanks for your opinion :)", "Yeah. That's like telling a blind person to see or a depressed person to not be depressed anymore.", "It\u2019s not, I have my own medical issues and need to find a way that they don\u2019t negatively affect my family and friends.   It\u2019s up to me to control them, it should\u2019ve tentatively effect them.", "Thats super anal for friends. An hour early every time they hang out? What is this, a business deal?", "Alternatively, in the UK trains come near me every 20 minutes. I suspect that for OP, it's somewhere in-between us.", "In my hometown, trains came twice a day. There was a 6am train, and a 7pm train and no in-between. If the 6am train ran late, the only option people would've had to get there early would've meant spending a whole (extra) night at their destination. Obviously people didn't take trains much, but it would've been perfectly reasonable (if expensive) to plan to take the 6am train out of town and arrive back on the 7pm train if you were traveling anywhere that was less than 3 hours away, for something important enough and driving full-on wasn't an option.", "Question - are you late to work too and do you get reprimanded or fired for it?", "Please define what you mean by \u201cbeing late.\u201d You know that your trains are beyond unreliable, so why do you commit to meeting up with anyone? I\u2019ve often told friends and co-workers \u201cIf I\u2019m there, I\u2019m there. If I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not. Go ahead without me and don\u2019t wait.\u201d And I, of course, text my friend(s) to let the group know what\u2019s going on. \n\nAnd actually, a 20-30 minute delay is a BIG deal unless you\u2019re factoring that delay into your schedule for meeting people, and you\u2019re leaving for the scheduled meetup way before what you should have to (per train schedule). \n\nIf you rely on your completely unreliable train schedule, then (of course) your friends are going to be irritated.", "Grow up.", "Most comments I've seen have suggested OP be at the destination at least an hour early. Counting in the travel time, these people are fully expecting OP to waste hours of their time so that they can avoid being 15 minutes late once a year.\n\nBe for fucking real.", "Maybe they work from home...", "With 20 - 30 minutes not being a big deal I mean not being a big deal to account for. I don\u2019t mind going out a bit earlier. Just not hours beforehand. \nI don\u2019t visit these friends by train btw. I only take it for major live events which usually take the whole day anyway. The few times (2) I\u2019ve been late by train where after work activities in which I could simply not fetch another train.", "I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about now. \u201c20-30 minutes not being a big deal I mean not being a big deal to account for.\u201d It is if those 20-30 minutes make you late. Are you willing to leave an hour or 90 minutes earlier to meet up with friends in order to get there on time since you know how unreliable the trains are? I know I have. \n\nAnd if you don\u2019t use the train to meet up with these friends, why did you mention it at all? And if you know that the trains you need are notoriously late, why would you agree to meet up with friends whilst knowing you\u2019d have to take the train? \n\nFrom your responses, it sounds to me like your definition of \u201clate\u201d and your friends\u2019 definition are different. And I would be one of the ones leaving. As someone who cannot stand tardiness, I find it utterly disrespectful to me when someone is historically late.", "I mentioned it because it\u2019s true. And because I don\u2019t think anyone would have even believed me if I said \u201eI stopped being late at once and never have been ever since\u201c because it\u2019s simply not true. I\u2019ve been late, and I don\u2019t try to hide that.\nI am saying that I don\u2019t mind leaving 20 - 30 minutes late for a train but I do have a problem with leaving 3 hours early and having to switch shifts at work just to account for some trains being late. Than I prefer not meeting up with anyone at all.", "Are you German?", "You don\u2019t mind leaving 20-30 minutes late for a train, but your friends obviously have an issue with it!"]}
