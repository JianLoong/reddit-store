As a reformed late person who is basically almost never late now, I'm obviously sympathetic from the get-go, but holy shit, your \"friends\" are such assholes.  \n\nOne thing I've noticed is that even though I've been good about being on time for literally like over 6 years, nobody notices.  The narrative is always \"Oh you know hereforlulz, she's always late\" or \"Wow, I can't believe you're on time.\"  I HAVE BEEN ON TIME FOR YEARS!  But it's hard to get narratives like that to go away because people simply don't notice.\n\nI don't know what to tell you.

But that's me.", "This is a hard one but I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. One occasion of being 15 minutes late after 2 years of making a concerted effort to be on time seems like it\u2019s well within the bounds of reason. I also don\u2019t understand why your friends waited until you got there to get up and walk out- it seems like they were trying to teach you a lesson, but that seems really petty if you truly aren\u2019t consistently late anymore.", "From the description I would say NTA but how often do you have a \"genuine\" reason to be late? I can't imagine friends would be that pissed over something so small unless there is something you are telling us.", "NTA-you told them you were running late and not to wait for you to order. I think it's rude of them to all get up and leave like that.", "YTA likely.  In your post you say in the last 2 years you\u2019ve only been late due to unforeseen circumstances.  From the point of view of your friends it only looks like you haven\u2019t changed and continue to be late.  There is a reason, likely unconscious, that you continue to be late, regardless of the reasons why.  I have a friend who\u2019s always late and to be honest it\u2019s a power move.  He shows his dominance by making people wait, though he\u2019ll deny that all day long.  There are people who make excuses and people who get things done.  Your friends are tired of the excuses and don\u2019t feel like they should have to continually wait on you and I don\u2019t blame them.  Don\u2019t try to be on time.  Be on time.", "YTA. You were running late:\n\n>maybe 10 minutes behind schedule.\n\nThen, the next line:\n\n>hurried up and got to the place maybe 15 minutes late in total\n\nSo, by hurrying up you got an additional 5 minutes delay. \n\nMissing a train is probably something you call 'something like a delayed train'. \n\nThink hard and try to remember, how often were you the first to arrive at a meeting with your friends? How often were you the last? You should be in the first half of the people to arrive 50% of the time just to be average. How often are you? \n\nI recommend posting a link to this to your friends, and ask them for their side.", "YTA\n\nApparently you've been late enough times that they've had enough. I'm also left wondering what you've left out of your story that merits such a strong response. Did they say anything to you all those other times you were late?\n\nI am someone who is never late. I always give plenty of time to reach my destination. It's called respect for other people's time. They don't have to give it to you.", "NTA\n\n15 minutes isn't even that bad, and you let Friends know beforehand that you were running behind. Even then just up and bailing on you when you did show up was a pretty jerk thing to do.\n\nI think you should make time for some better friends.", "The problem is you don\u2019t see the issue with being late.  You can make any excuse you want, but the simple fact is you don\u2019t value the time of others.  You fkd around one too many times and now you found out.  YTA", "YTA - obviously they are done with you and only waited to say goodbye. There isn\u2019t a good era and bad era. They see you are late again and they are done.\n\nFind new friends.\n\nEdit: I also think you are being disingenuous if you say \u201cyou weren\u2019t late without a reason.\u201d Leave earlier.\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to think 10 minutes late matters. But you were 15 minutes late. How long would you stay and wait for someone when everyone else is there on time.\n\nI don\u2019t think you have solved your problem at all.", "NTA. In this particular case, you being late didn't really negatively affect them. I assume there were at least two of them, and they could have just ordered drinks and enjoyed a chat without your absence being a problem.\n\nMy guess is that they still view you as the person late to everything, despite the improvements you have made, and they wanted to send you a message that it was not okay with them.", "NTA\n\nYes it\u2019s rough to have someone trail into old habits, but that\u2019s clearly not what this is. To expect someone to be perfectly punctual every time is a bit silly. You also prefaced you would be late, which I think adds to you not being the AH. I\u2019m sorry that they got up and left, because you didn\u2019t deserve that at all. It seems they\u2019re hung up on it still if they were so apt for leaving in the manor that they did", "If your story is as written NTA.\n\nThis seems like a wild over reaction when you warned them. You were only 15 minutes late to a restaurant.  You told them to order without you. \n\nFor a reaction this big, it feels like you are missing parts of the story.", "ESH. Being late without extenuating circumstances is rude and disrespectful. But, then all leaving you was also rude and, frankly, uncalled for. You were all assholes.", "[deleted]", "ESH. Your friends were wrong to do this but it sounds like they have been burned by you many many times before and have finally reached the end of their collective rope. It is disrespectful of their time and it seems you think nothing of wasting theirs.", "Info how often did you have 'genuine reason' to be late. Because if it's often, then your friends aren't seeing a difference.", "ESH if you are a \"reformed late person\" then you aren't late anymore.  You were late.  Your friends also suck", "NTA and never were. I'm always on time or early and i never understood why it could be a problem when someone is a bit late to casual things like drinks and dinner or something. Its freetime at least, no need to stress out being on time... and start drama over a few minutes. My bff is always late, last time to her own b-day party (1h) and guess what? Nobody was mad at all.

All that you can do when you're running late is communicate what is going on and get there as quickly (but safely) as you can. Sometimes circumstances like the  train running late, partner got home late to watch the kids, or terrible traffic just happens and you can't do much about it. \n\nI think it is very petty of the friend group to literally wait until you got there, then leave to go somewhere else without you. They are TA for doing that. \n\nI would question why they made the comment about \"being worth time,\" because running late doesn't seem to be potent enough to warrant that sort of reaction. Could there be other aspects of the friendship that impacted the situation and made this the last straw? \n\nIf the issue truly is just you running late, then NTA and your friends are definitely TA. You said yourself that they run late sometimes too, it's not fair to hold you to a higher standard than the rest of them.", "What happened to you, happens to everyone occasionally. The difference is, you have a reputation. As a previous poster said, people don\u2019t see all the times you have been on time once you have the reputation as someone who is always late. \nMy advice would be to send a message to everyone on the group either all at once or individually. Basically, tell them what you have told us. Give them a link to this post if you like and let them see what others have to say. \nMake sure you tell them how hard you have worked to make sure you have been on time for the past two years and that this one was just an honest slip up like everyone occasionally has. \nI don\u2019t know how close you are to this group but if they can\u2019t hear and accept that message, you may need to find a new group to hang with, where you don\u2019t already have a reputation. \nNTA", "Not often - Maybe once or twice in the whole time.

Are you late more often than everyone else? If so, you can\u2019t blame the trains.", "The other times I\u2019ve been late where because of stuff that was well out of my own control.

If you know that the trains are very unreliable, then you plan for that to be an emergency. Be a bit ahead. When you are a person who is known for being chronically late, and are only two years into fixing that, you need to be the one to plan for emergencies, not them. It is on you to fix, which means you need to work on trying to not only be on time, but in cases where you rely on public transportation you need to try and plan to be there early.\n\nI commend you for actually recognizing the problem and taking the steps to fix it, but ultimately when relying on public transportation taking the steps to just be on time is not always enough. It sucks, I have to rely on public transportation too. So I definitely get it. Having to rely on other people getting you to places is annoying, but when that's the case you have to plan for not only the best outcome but also the worst outcome ahead of time. Since you have failed to do that, you are the one at fault. And it seems like your friends have finally reached their breaking point.\n\nWho knows, from their point of view it could be like \"They were doing so good for two years, and then they just slip up without a reasonable excuse, great they're about to fall back into their same habits because we just let it go this whole time\".

As i said i (personal) think there is no issue. And i think being on time in your freetime is overrated and i (for myself) can't see why someone wouldn't value me bc i had to wait a little.

They intentionally humiliated you in public because you were unintentionally 15 mins late. I would never do that to someone even if I were annoyed they were late. You also sent a text letting them know, which was courteous. My dad is frequently late. Last week I was babysitting my nephew and 20 mins after he was supposed to be there to take over, I texted him asking where he was. 5 mins later I get a text saying, \u201cleaving now, sorry.\u201d That situation is much more frustrating.

Did your friends ever take notice you\u2019ve been improving on your time management? \n\nEveryone roasting you in the comments is super stingy, like you\u2019re always supposed to plan to be 2 hours early for everything. Things happen, trains are unreliable. Not everyone has a car. If your friends think your company is not waiting 15 minutes for, they aren\u2019t worth YOUR time.", "Same. I would find another friend group if that happened to me.", "Nope, the train is delayed but you are late. \nIf delayed trains are commonplace you take the average delay into the planning time.\n\nIf not you are late, and you know you are going to be late and you face the consequences... In this case friends getting mad, in another not showing up for work on time or not getting to an appointment.\n\nIf you value your friends time you take the previous train and try to be there on-time.", "That... might not help your case. It may come off as you blaming the trains for your own fuckup. \n\nIf the trains are infrequent and have a habit of janky lateness there not necessarily much you can do. Or a line closure as you're rocking up to the station.\n\nFor me, I live 20mins away from my local station so I check the trains when I wake up to see how fucked they are that morning and recheck in case I need to run out of the door to get the one before or something. For work, I try to schedule it so I'm taking one train before the one I need to - if I get to work early I just spend 20-30mns before my workday reading internet/writing blog or something nonwork. If you're going to a pub/cafe/restaurant can always kill time with a drink. \n\nBeing late once or twice in a year is not a biggie though imo. But once you get that 'perennially late' reputation it can be hard to shift it.", "You yourself said the trains are unreliable.  If that\u2019s the case you can take an earlier train to mitigate the risk of a train making you late.  You are making excuses for your lateness instead of doing things to ensure you aren\u2019t.", "Look, I live in a country that trains have delays. I know this. And I plan around it. If the train is on time, I am there 20 or 30 minutes early, and if it's late, I am on time. \n\nThing is... People that are constantly late always have a reason. \nAnd it's tiring. For example, I have a friend that lives on the city (she doesn't need to use trains) but when we met on the weekends she chose to take the bus or the metro and on weekends it's common knowledge they don't keep the regular every 2 min schedule. Sooooo, we met, I arrive 10 minutes early sometimes more, she knows this, and she chronically arrives 15 min late. \nWhy? Because the Metro was 7 minutes instead of 3 min apart. \nWhy does she always forget that the metro runs every seven minutes instead of 7 on the weekends? Or she simply doesn't value my time? After 10 times I realized it was the latter and stopped meeting with her in certain scenarios where I knew she would make me wait.", "Sounds like a you problem.", "Eh, I do that because I\u2019m an anxious mess and hate being late so I overcompensate but most people don\u2019t and I don\u2019t think everyone should have to. He wasn\u2019t late to a wedding or a job interview - he was late for dinner. He let them know he was running late, too.", "Thats a bit too anal for friends isn't it? I totally understand doing that for more formal occasions and business things but brunch with the pals isn't really a scenario where you need to plan ahead that much. This is coming from someone who sees being exactly on time as late for myself. I just like cutting my friends some slack. An hour early all the time to risk never being minutes late just seems to be way overcorrecting.", "I don't know about everywhere else, but in the US, trains near me come every 3-6 hours. I'm not sure \"leave at 2pm to make sure you get to an 8pm meetup on time\" is a reasonable alternative.", "So, how many hours beforehand should the OP leave home to account for trains? 5?6? Maybe just try to be in the meeting place the day before just to be sure? \n\nThere's no reason to be shitting on a stranger and this is what you're doing.", "Still making excuses.  Catch a cab or get an Uber.  Stop\u2026making\u2026excuses.  Just do it.  My last response to this as I\u2019ve made my point and you either get it or you don\u2019t.  If you don\u2019t then that\u2019s why your friends are pissed.", "With enough hyperbole any suggestion can sound ridiculous.", "I mean, I usually take the train when heading into the city because I physically cannot afford to catch the $60 Uber to Detroit from where I am. I think it's okay to be late \"once or twice in two years\"."]}
