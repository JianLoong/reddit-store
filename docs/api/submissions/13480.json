As a reformed late person who is basically almost never late now, I'm obviously sympathetic from the get-go, but holy shit, your \"friends\" are such assholes.  \n\nOne thing I've noticed is that even though I've been good about being on time for literally like over 6 years, nobody notices.  The narrative is always \"Oh you know hereforlulz, she's always late\" or \"Wow, I can't believe you're on time.\"  I HAVE BEEN ON TIME FOR YEARS!  But it's hard to get narratives like that to go away because people simply don't notice.\n\nI don't know what to tell you.

But that's me.", "This is a hard one but I\u2019m leaning towards NTA. One occasion of being 15 minutes late after 2 years of making a concerted effort to be on time seems like it\u2019s well within the bounds of reason. I also don\u2019t understand why your friends waited until you got there to get up and walk out- it seems like they were trying to teach you a lesson, but that seems really petty if you truly aren\u2019t consistently late anymore.", "From the description I would say NTA but how often do you have a \"genuine\" reason to be late? I can't imagine friends would be that pissed over something so small unless there is something you are telling us.", "NTA-you told them you were running late and not to wait for you to order. I think it's rude of them to all get up and leave like that.", "YTA likely.  In your post you say in the last 2 years you\u2019ve only been late due to unforeseen circumstances.  From the point of view of your friends it only looks like you haven\u2019t changed and continue to be late.  There is a reason, likely unconscious, that you continue to be late, regardless of the reasons why.  I have a friend who\u2019s always late and to be honest it\u2019s a power move.  He shows his dominance by making people wait, though he\u2019ll deny that all day long.  There are people who make excuses and people who get things done.  Your friends are tired of the excuses and don\u2019t feel like they should have to continually wait on you and I don\u2019t blame them.  Don\u2019t try to be on time.  Be on time.", "YTA. You were running late:\n\n>maybe 10 minutes behind schedule.\n\nThen, the next line:\n\n>hurried up and got to the place maybe 15 minutes late in total\n\nSo, by hurrying up you got an additional 5 minutes delay. \n\nMissing a train is probably something you call 'something like a delayed train'. \n\nThink hard and try to remember, how often were you the first to arrive at a meeting with your friends? How often were you the last? You should be in the first half of the people to arrive 50% of the time just to be average. How often are you? \n\nI recommend posting a link to this to your friends, and ask them for their side.", "YTA\n\nApparently you've been late enough times that they've had enough. I'm also left wondering what you've left out of your story that merits such a strong response. Did they say anything to you all those other times you were late?\n\nI am someone who is never late. I always give plenty of time to reach my destination. It's called respect for other people's time. They don't have to give it to you.", "NTA\n\n15 minutes isn't even that bad, and you let Friends know beforehand that you were running behind. Even then just up and bailing on you when you did show up was a pretty jerk thing to do.\n\nI think you should make time for some better friends.", "The problem is you don\u2019t see the issue with being late.  You can make any excuse you want, but the simple fact is you don\u2019t value the time of others.  You fkd around one too many times and now you found out.  YTA", "YTA - obviously they are done with you and only waited to say goodbye. There isn\u2019t a good era and bad era. They see you are late again and they are done.\n\nFind new friends.\n\nEdit: I also think you are being disingenuous if you say \u201cyou weren\u2019t late without a reason.\u201d Leave earlier.\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to think 10 minutes late matters. But you were 15 minutes late. How long would you stay and wait for someone when everyone else is there on time.\n\nI don\u2019t think you have solved your problem at all.", "NTA. In this particular case, you being late didn't really negatively affect them. I assume there were at least two of them, and they could have just ordered drinks and enjoyed a chat without your absence being a problem.\n\nMy guess is that they still view you as the person late to everything, despite the improvements you have made, and they wanted to send you a message that it was not okay with them.", "NTA\n\nYes it\u2019s rough to have someone trail into old habits, but that\u2019s clearly not what this is. To expect someone to be perfectly punctual every time is a bit silly. You also prefaced you would be late, which I think adds to you not being the AH. I\u2019m sorry that they got up and left, because you didn\u2019t deserve that at all. It seems they\u2019re hung up on it still if they were so apt for leaving in the manor that they did", "If your story is as written NTA.\n\nThis seems like a wild over reaction when you warned them. You were only 15 minutes late to a restaurant.  You told them to order without you. \n\nFor a reaction this big, it feels like you are missing parts of the story.", "ESH. Being late without extenuating circumstances is rude and disrespectful. But, then all leaving you was also rude and, frankly, uncalled for. You were all assholes.", "[deleted]", "ESH. Your friends were wrong to do this but it sounds like they have been burned by you many many times before and have finally reached the end of their collective rope.

Because if it's often, then your friends aren't seeing a difference.", "ESH if you are a \"reformed late person\" then you aren't late anymore.  You were late.  Your friends also suck", "NTA and never were. I'm always on time or early and i never understood why it could be a problem when someone is a bit late to casual things like drinks and dinner or something. Its freetime at least, no need to stress out being on time... and start drama over a few minutes. My bff is always late, last time to her own b-day party (1h) and guess what? Nobody was mad at all.

All that you can do when you're running late is communicate what is going on and get there as quickly (but safely) as you can. Sometimes circumstances like the  train running late, partner got home late to watch the kids, or terrible traffic just happens and you can't do much about it. \n\nI think it is very petty of the friend group to literally wait until you got there, then leave to go somewhere else without you. They are TA for doing that. \n\nI would question why they made the comment about \"being worth time,\" because running late doesn't seem to be potent enough to warrant that sort of reaction. Could there be other aspects of the friendship that impacted the situation and made this the last straw? \n\nIf the issue truly is just you running late, then NTA and your friends are definitely TA. You said yourself that they run late sometimes too, it's not fair to hold you to a higher standard than the rest of them.", "What happened to you, happens to everyone occasionally. The difference is, you have a reputation. As a previous poster said, people don\u2019t see all the times you have been on time once you have the reputation as someone who is always late. \nMy advice would be to send a message to everyone on the group either all at once or individually. Basically, tell them what you have told us. Give them a link to this post if you like and let them see what others have to say. \nMake sure you tell them how hard you have worked to make sure you have been on time for the past two years and that this one was just an honest slip up like everyone occasionally has. \nI don\u2019t know how close you are to this group but if they can\u2019t hear and accept that message, you may need to find a new group to hang with, where you don\u2019t already have a reputation. \nNTA", "Not often - Maybe once or twice in the whole time.

Are you late more often than everyone else? If so, you can\u2019t blame the trains.", "The other times I\u2019ve been late where because of stuff that was well out of my own control.

If you know that the trains are very unreliable, then you plan for that to be an emergency. Be a bit ahead. When you are a person who is known for being chronically late, and are only two years into fixing that, you need to be the one to plan for emergencies, not them. It is on you to fix, which means you need to work on trying to not only be on time, but in cases where you rely on public transportation you need to try and plan to be there early.\n\nI commend you for actually recognizing the problem and taking the steps to fix it, but ultimately when relying on public transportation taking the steps to just be on time is not always enough. It sucks, I have to rely on public transportation too. So I definitely get it. Having to rely on other people getting you to places is annoying, but when that's the case you have to plan for not only the best outcome but also the worst outcome ahead of time. Since you have failed to do that, you are the one at fault.

As i said i (personal) think there is no issue. And i think being on time in your freetime is overrated and i (for myself) can't see why someone wouldn't value me bc i had to wait a little.

They intentionally humiliated you in public because you were unintentionally 15 mins late. I would never do that to someone even if I were annoyed they were late. You also sent a text letting them know, which was courteous. My dad is frequently late.

For work, I try to schedule it so I'm taking one train before the one I need to - if I get to work early I just spend 20-30mns before my workday reading internet/writing blog or something nonwork.

Sooooo, we met, I arrive 10 minutes early sometimes more, she knows this, and she chronically arrives 15 min late. \nWhy? Because the Metro was 7 minutes instead of 3 min apart. \nWhy does she always forget that the metro runs every seven minutes instead of 7 on the weekends? Or she simply doesn't value my time?

Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019m going to say NAH, but I really think if you were being honest it\u2019s probably a YTA. I live in a city with VERY inconsistent public transit, so I often get places very early and just go for a walk or browse a nearby shop to kill time so I\u2019m not late.

And I hope you find better friends!\n\nETA: Is there a name for the logical fallacy of \u201ctheir reaction seemed disproportionate, so OP must be hiding something?\u201d Like maybe their reaction was disproportionate because they\u2019re petty, immature, and cruel?", "INFO You say you used to be chronically late, but haven't had that problem for 2 years--were these friends around back when you were chronically late?\n\nIf so that would make their actions here more understandable (they've been burned too many overall times).", "Dear god can you and OP please tell me how to resolve my chronic lateness \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude2d", "Same.

A lot of people who say they don\u2019t like your behavior don\u2019t actually want you to change all that much.", "I'm not your friend, so I can't be certain this is the case, but I do want to mention this for others that might be reading your comment (and perhaps you, if it's applicable for your friend).   \n\n\nFor many of us with ADHD and time-blindness, it's not personal. It's not that we don't value your time as much as our own, rather it's largely because we assume that if our friends truly want us around, they will be understanding.   \n\n\nFor clarification/edification:  \nThe idea that someone being chronically late because they don't respect your time, and thus they're \"...not putting the same effort into our relationship...\", is a bit presumptuous. It's a conclusion, based on a hypothesis, made by assuming motivation for an interpretation of an action. \"They're always late, therefore, they must not respect my time, therefore, they're not trying as hard as I am in our relationship'. But no one can say how much effort anyone else puts into something or not.\n\nFor those without ADHD, it may seem as simple as saying, 'don't be late', and that just informing them of the problem (being chronically late == disrespect) would fix the issue. So, then the assumption is 'well I told them so if they keep doing it, then they're not respecting me/my time', but honestly, for many it's not that simple at all. I mean, many of us have a very limited amount of resources to work with (see Google for the spoon theory for more info), and 'not being a few minutes late' may take enough of those resources that 'doing the dishes' later would be removed from the to-do list for that day. As much as I hate that it's true, sometimes it's a cost-benefit analysis problem. If something takes a considerable amount of effort for a fairly low-stakes return, it may be deemed 'not worth it'. (For note, for me to make sure I make it to an important meeting, I literally can do NOTHING else the entire morning before I leave, because I can easily get caught up in 'just checking email' and lose all track of time. It just doesn't exist to me if I'm doing something else.) \n\nDepending on the individual and the severity of their problem, they may be putting in even more effort into the relationship than on-time friend to be 'just 15 minutes late'. Completely 'fixing the issue', i.e. 'being consistently on time', takes effort, forethought and, planning (not our strongest skill to begin with). And even then, it's not guaranteed to be maintainable in the long term (not only does it take more effort than we can sometimes muster to form a habit in the first place, sometimes 'firmly established habits' can just vanish without notice). It really has little to nothing to do with respect at all.  \n\n\n(I mean, even not being late to an interview isn't out of respect for the interviewer's time, but rather the personal consequences of potentially not getting the job... and even then, I've still been late to interviews a few times.)  \n\n\nOh, also, the 'constantly making excuses, so the other person doesn't get mad'... that's trained behaviour, likely because of 'people of authority', or from people getting mad.  \nGot to inform your boss why you're running late, after all, if you want to keep the job. Or let your friends' know that you're running behind schedule, because if you don't, they might start to think you're avoiding them (or not respecting their time), when honestly, you may made the mistake of checking your email right before you left, and you got one that needed an answer \\*right now\\* (mainly because if you didn't answer it right away, you'd forget about it until a day or two later... and now you're nervous because you missed an appointment with the person on Monday, because you were running super late because you set your appointment reminder *too early* and fell into the 'oh my appointment is 20 minutes away, and my reminder was set to an hour ahead so I have time to get ready, so I can just check this one thing real quick, and it wasn't real quick, and the email was the 'appointment cancellation' notice, and it's now Wednesday, and you still haven't emailed them back to apologize and reschedule the appointment, and you know you need to but it's awkward, and your anxiety is now spiking because what if they aren't willing to reschedule, but you know that's dumb... but what if?! Why no, this is not an actual real-life example of my life right at this moment, why do you ask?) So yeah, anyway as you can see, life can easily run away from us.", "Yeah honestly I feel crazy reading how many YTAs there are.

Do not arrive early, I AM BUSY\n\nThe Europeans learned, eventually", "Some people deal with executive dysfunction by being chronically early because the idea of being late is so anxiety inducing that that's where all their brain power goes. Some people with executive dysfunction realize earlier on that they are hurting others with their behavior and work to find solutions. There are a variety of ways that executive dysfunction is handled by people, but it's ultimately up to us to figure out how to not affect others with our problems or deal with the consequences. Chronic late people don't have the corner on the market of executive dysfunction, but thank you for explaining it to me.\n\nI said that apologies without changed behavior are hollow. If someone does something that negatively affects you, say something as simple as stepping on your bare foot while wearing shoes when entering your house, and they apologize, you forgive them and move on, right? Say it happens because of an issue with their sight that can be corrected with glasses but they don't wear them regularly. Now say this happens the next time they visit. They apologize again, you accept and move on. Now say it happens every single time you see them for two years straight. At some point, their apology means nothing because they are aware that they are hurting you, they could take measures to make sure it doesn't happen, but they don't.  \n\nI'm glad you've found the tools to help you not be late all the time. I'm sure it gives you more grace for others as well, and that's great. If you don't have any friends who are always late, it's going to be harder for you to understand how others felt dealing with you being chronically late for years. All I suggested was that you have a conversation with your friends where you sincerely apologize to your friends for your past behaviors. Alcoholics do it as part of recovery. Having a condition that causes you to hurt others, even unintentionally, is a reason for your actions, not an excuse. True friends will accept your apology and forgive you, but you have to give a sincere apology after you've demonstrated that you're actually remorseful for your prior behavior. Your friends should apologize for inadvertently hurting your feelings after you've shown honest efforts to do better. We should want to make amends to the people we've hurt regardless of the reason, if we care about them. \n\nI'll be honest, you sound like you're upset that you're not getting credit for working hard to change, and I get that, but it doesn't sound like you've honestly apologized in a way that can be considered sincere. Sorry I'm late (but everyone knows I'll be late next time too) doesn't mean much when the behavior hasn't changed. Changing the behavior and then apologizing is much more sincere and can really help with resentment.", "I probably care somewhat less than you do, as the alternative is feeling like shit about myself, and I\u2019ve got enough struggles there already.  \n\nBut I do try.

Most things I do with them are casual anyway so it's not a big deal. \n\nTo be clear, it's still rude, but we learn to accept flaws when we love someone. If it's casual friends though, I wouldn't be as charitable.", "Cancel and flake because I care about my friends\u2019 time and don\u2019t want them waiting for me for 30-45 minutes? Now if they tell me to still come and just keep them updated on my new ETA, I\u2019d do that. \n\nAnd actually my life is quite full, thank you very much. I manage and plan my time well. I respect other people\u2019s time and never schedule something where I\u2019m going to cut it close regarding arriving on time. I\u2019ll either let my friends know that I might not be able to get there when they want to meet due to traffic, public transportation, meetings running notoriously late, etc or schedule our meet up for 30 minutes later so I know I can be on time. That way, no one is wasting their time waiting on me. \n\nBut it always amazes me that others manage to routinely arrive on time and others just don\u2019t.", "\n>Like I mentioned in the post already, I\u2019ve made a big deal of being on time or earlier in the past 2 years. So I\u2019ve not been late expect for this one time with my friends I\u2019ve describing.\n\n\nIf this is really true, then my guess would be that they had this plan in place to walk out on you the next time you were late for the last 2 years. They probably finally got their chance and had been waiting for the opportunity to do this.", "OP says \u201cgenuine reason.\u201d I wonder how often that happened and what the reasoning was.", "Letting your friends know you\u2019re going to be late because your train is late is literally what OP did. You canceling because your train is delayed vs her saying \u201cI\u2019ll be late my train is delayed, feel free to carry on without me,\u201d is materially the same thing, you\u2019re just canceling and depriving your friends of your company and then patting yourself on the back for it. That\u2019s *not* better."]}
