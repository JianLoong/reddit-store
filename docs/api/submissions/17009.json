He's kinda a prick, I feel like he wants to be in charge more than he wants to be happy. He also starts an argument every time I go out with my friends because \"They'll get you into drugs\" when none of us do drugs.\n\nAnyway I came down with asthma a few weeks ago, which sucks but whatever, and they gave me a rescue inhaler in case I have an attack. That hasn't happened yet, but you never know. Anyway I got dropped off there last sunday (I do weekends with my dad) and he wanted my inhaler. Apparently he saw somewhere that kids are hiding nitrous canisters in inhalers, and is convinced I faked my asthma just to do that. I only gave it to him after he threatened to punish me, and then called my dad.\n\nHe picked me up, and got my inhaler back after my mom showed pics of the doctors paperwork. I still went with my dad, and I'm not gonna go back. Stepdad said he'd give it back, but I don't trust him and I like breathing. So I told my mom either him or I can live with her, not both.\n\nIssue is that in my state, the courts really don't give a shit what teens want, even older ones, and now they're taking my dad to court. He's planning to fight it, but the best he can get is probably 50/50 and they'll enforce that.
