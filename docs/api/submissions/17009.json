Look for free legal advice regarding, um, attempted manslaughter? What ever they call it. Get a doctor to help with a psychological impact statement. Or maybe the school if they have someone. Get a statement from the school anyway. Detailing their handling of asthma and view in your studies and impact of trauma. Get some personality statements, not the right name, statements about how the parent you want is a good person. About five. Write your own statement. Inform the wider family. Inform the local church. Tell the local health services. Get the local hospital to confirm how they would respond and your survival chances. If there\u2019s a pattern for your parent to not prioritize your needs then make some sort of retroactive incident log. Don\u2019t give up without truly trying to challenge this. Get a tshirt made up to wear to court even. State your case. Be loud and consistent.", "NTA and also you should remind your mother that any custody order will expire in two years and after that you get to decide if you see her/them at all. The more she pushes this the more disincentive she gives you to keep her in your life", "Immature for not believing him about what? That he won't take it again? He already argues with you about going out with friends because of drugs that none of you do. And withheld your inhaler because people use them to hide nitrous cannisters. You act more grown up than he does. What is his hangup with drugs? Is he an addict? Either way, he could have caused you a lot of harm by taking your inhaler and refusing to give it back. That alone should be a good reason for you to not live there until he is gone. My parents remained married until my father's death. I have been married for 46 years so obviously have not had to deal with having or being a single parent, but in my opinion, the needs of the child come before the needs of the parent. The one that needs to grow up is not you. Your mother needs to understand that your actual needs, physical and emotional, need to come before her love life, if the two are not compatible. I hope your dad is successful in getting custody of you. Preferably full custody since your mom doesn't care to understand that you don't feel safe there with her boyfriend there.", "The guy sounds a bit crazy with the drug thing. I mean 15 should be old enough to decide where you want to live. I never heard of a state that doesn't take into account the wishes of a 15-year-old. But even if that's not the case, there's still a strong case for emotional abuse and withholding medical device. So even if the courts don't care what you want, your dad's lawyer could still make a case that it's an unfit environment for you. I hope you get to stay with your dad.\n\nNTA", "Let\u2019s label things accurately for the court:\n\nYour mother\u2019s boy friend moved in.  He then stole your asthma medication that was prescribed for you by a medical doctor.  As a result, no only do you no longer feel safe at your mother\u2019s home, but you aren\u2019t safe.  \n\nThat\u2019s how to describe what happened to the judge.  NTA.", "And stepdad didn't even believe mom, she had to show paperwork!", "If you have to go back call Child Protective Services (or whatever your state calls it) next time he pulls that crap.", "NTA. And your \u201cstepdad\u201d isn\u2019t even your legal stepdad. As such your mother is the parent that should define appropriate boundaries for her boyfriend", "Maybe bring some documentation that describes how severe asthma attacks can be fatal, just in case the judge doesn't understand/believe that.\n\nI saw your note about how family court in your state doesn't take teens' opinions into account. I would expect that kind of idiocy to go hand in hand with antiscience views like \"asthma isn't that bad\".", "Even if they don\u2019t listen to OP, they should be listening to the fact that step dad is being medically abusive and with holding life saving medication. And mom is letting it happen. \n\nIf step dad does it again, I\u2019d start calling the cops to have it on record.", "Yeah like denying important prescription medication is definitely enough to catch any decent judge's attention even if they don't care about opinions. Worth making a bit of a fuss about it at least.", "Not only that, but him taking away a *prescribed* medication of a *minor* that is *NOT HIS CHILD* could be seen as abuse, tampering and theft of a medication *not* prescribed to him. I do believe that's a federal offense and I would be sure to tell your dad that. Especially as your \"mother\" isn't standing up to the moron and defending her own child!!", "This responae needs to be higher up!", "CPS could probably get the mom on neglect or improper supervision but it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of medical neglect as defined by CPS policy in most of the US. To qualify as medical neglect the action has to have negatively affected the child\u2019s medical/physical/mental health. Because there wasn\u2019t an asthma attack while the inhaler was being withheld means it didn\u2019t negatively impact the health so it\u2019s not medical neglect to CPS.", "OP's Mom is unfit, to put it as gently as possible. Her boyfriend deprived her child of potentially life-saving medical equipment, and she's still living with him.", "That\u2019s called a guardian ad lietem in child custody cases and us effectually just another attorney dad has to pay. \n\nThis is a straight up medical issue and should not require a GAL as mom is denying medical treatment.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

This man took you\u2019re sons inhaler, basically called him a drug addict with no proof, would not give it back to either parent until mom showed doctors paper work and she didn\u2019t immediately kick his ass out? Who does this man think he is? By what logic and authority is he operating on? It blows my mind that the mom is allowing him to do this to her child. Op is not safe at his moms house. His mom is not protecting her son. That man is dangerously screwed up.\n\nEdit: corrected op from F to M", "Maybe OP should make CPS aware of this first incidence so they can document any further occurrences as a repeat. Also, add a note that the stepdad isn't even an official stepdad bc he isn't married to the mother - the overstepping becomes worse under this light.", "There shouldnt be a next time.

I\u2019m upper midwest, and perhaps it happens elsewhere.", "Not always, my child's friends a court appointed representative, non lawyer, whose only job is to advocate for the child. Neither parents pay, since it would be a conflict of interest. I believe she is similar to CPS and had a therapist for degree.", "If it is court ordered, the Dad won\u2019t have to pay for it.

CASA volunteers are not attorneys.", "That\u2019s true in most states, as well.", "I\u2019ve literally had a fit and young friend die from an asthma attack, even with modern medicine.
