I used to be able to walk him on a leash but the new and bigger city scares him so now he rides in his little mesh backpack. \n\nI\u2019ve been going on daily walks exploring my new neighborhood and I always load kitty into his bag and take him with me. We go down 2 flights of stairs and directly out the door. We don\u2019t hang around in the halls.\n\nOne neighbor, 2 doors down from me, immediately started complaining that my cat being in the hallway triggers his allergies and he doesn\u2019t want me to take my cat out of my apartment at all, ever and that I am violating the building's rules.\n\nThe problem is what I feel is a poorly written policy \u2013 it simply says \u201cno pets in common areas\u201d. To me, this clearly reads as \u201cno pets roaming freely in the common areas\u201d instead of barring them from the halls altogether.

In order to get any animal on a walk or to the vet, they have to pass through the common areas.\n\nHe has been watching me through the peephole (he opens the door to bitch at me as soon as I walk by, which I assume would make his allergic reaction worse but whatever\u2026) and I\u2019ve been really uncomfortable. I lost my patience yesterday and told him I don\u2019t give a f\\*ck about him or his allergies and I would be filing a complaint with building management over his harassment. He called me a c\\*nt and slammed the door.\n\nI was on the phone with my mom when this happened and she started lecturing me about being sensitive to other peoples\u2019 needs and that she raised me better than that.
