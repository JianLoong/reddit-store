My brother married an LDS woman and converted soon after. I am agnostic.\n\nLDS doctrine allows for \u201cbaptism of the dead\u201d. It's common, and not spoken of often.

I found this whole thing kind of creepy and weird like most things LDS, so I didn't think much of it. My mother? Not happy at all! Not about the baptism itself, she was pissed they never asked her what our dad would want. She made it VERY clear that he was never to \u201cbaptize\u201d her. Net even in death.

Shortly after we ate, I was playing video games with my nephews, and they mentioned they missed their aunt, and were glad they had baptized her a few years ago. I WAS PISSED but held my cool until most people had left. Then, I got very openly angry with my brother and his wife. Some of the family was still there and began to gather against me. Literally everybody except the couple friends I brought with me were basically telling me how much of a jerk I am for bringing it up at all. I made the point that this discussion took place between my brother and our mother long before this and he was very aware that my mother would not have wanted this and did not approve of it. Of course, they all brought up the same argument that why does it matter if she's dead? They just could not understand my point about respecting her wishes\u2026wishes she made clear.\n\nThis soon became a conversation that every Mormon in the house felt they had a stake in. They were all telling me how much of a jerk I am for being angry with my brother and his wife for doing it.

They don't baptize their children until they're eight years old. They claim it's so their children have some semblance of what religion is but who knows what the actual reason is. I had a friend of mine who was Catholic once tell me that they baptized their children not only so that they're saved by God but so that the children feel some sense of obligation to stay in the religion all of their lives. Don't know if that's true but it tracks.

It's a classic.", "Don't read the many many articles about the LDS church getting in trouble for continuously baptizing Holocaust victims despite being told over and over again by the Jewish community how entirely fucked up and NOT OKAY that is.

I love bluntly telling the missionaries why they should just skip my house while doing their proselytizing.", "Sounds like you have this well in hand!", "I mean I don\u2019t know about any of that. It\u2019s their heart felt belief, just because you don\u2019t understand it, or even don\u2019t like it, doesn\u2019t make them dumb or evil. Just saying.\n\nThere are ALOT of Mormons who are way smarter and way nicer then you or me.", "Well, one is better than none <wicked grin>", "Of course! Sorry for the long answer but it's a topic i think is really interesting:)\n\nSo as you probably know adult baptism is a way of publicly showing your faith in Christ, which means that baptizing babies makes no sense because they obviously don't understand religion and don't have any faith to profess.\n\nBUT for chuches that do infant baptism they don't consider it to be a profession of faith but the sign of the covenant. So how in the old testament circumcision is a symbol of the covenant between God and Abraham, now that we're under the new covenant with Jesus we have a new symbol - baptism. So babies are baptized not because they're Christians already, but as a way for their parents to say that they're going to be raised in the family of God & the new covenant. And that hopefully those children with grow up to share their parents faith but they don't have to (obviously). \n\nSo the confusion comes from the fact that both types of churches are using the same symbol (baptism) for different things (public profession of faith/sign of the new covenant). Churches that do infant baptism see church membership as the public profession/way to share a testimony depending on church, which is equivalent to how adult baptism churches see baptism. And for churches that adult baptism the equivalent to infant baptism would be like a baby dedication/christening (?? less sure about that one i don't think it's as common to have a 'sign of the covenant' equivalent).\n\nAnd a scripture justification for infant baptism (the only one i remember off the top of my head but i know there's others lol) is Acts 16:33 \" At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized.\" because the baptism of an entire household would have almost definitely included infants/kids too young to understand. And scripture justification for adults baptism is that Jesus was baptized as an adult/the people who we explicitly see baptized in the Bible are adults.", "And if you're curious (and not tired of listening to me lol) i personally don't think either is biblically 'wrong' and it's a matter of how you interpret what's in the Bible & what symbolism you like better which way you choose. Personally I prefer infant baptism because I love the symbolism of it being a way to mark children as part of the covenant before they can even remotely understand what that means. But that being said, i was baptized as an adult in a church that practices infant baptism", "Actually I made it a point to learn everything I could about the Mormons when my brother decided to convert. Sadly I read way more than I ever would have wanted to. Some of it was humorous like their masturbation pamphlets for teens and the anti-gay stuff from the 90s that aren't around anymore, but yeah believe me I already did that deep dive and would never want to do it again. Scary shit they do. The funny thing is that the things most people think they know about the Mormons isn't true but if they knew the actual stuff, they'd be mortified and horrified.", "There was a little sarcasm in my last comment but I have just come to my own personal belief and conclusion that anyone who buys into the thinking and rituals like many the LDS church doctrine says...kinda makes me think there's a screw loose...somewhere.", "I was Episcopalian, and baptism there is seen as making you a child of God (my understanding of it at least). It showed I was part of the covenant and the community. Then at 12 I was confirmed, which seems to be similar to adult baptism, it was to profess that I was agreeing to be part of the church and stand by my faith. I think Catholicism is similar, they\u2019re big on infant baptisms because from my understanding only baptized people go to heaven. Then the confirmation is you agreeing with the initial baptism.", "that's really interesting. I was raised Roman Catholic (no longer practicing) and was taught that infants are baptized to wash away original sin. Parents extend their faith on their child\u2019s behalf as infants cannot profess faith and be saved themselves. I don't know how true this is, but I was told we baptize so young because infant mortality rates used to be so high, and if original sin wasn't cleansed, then the child wouldn't go to Heaven.", "Absolutely. There are many legitimate reasons why I haven't spoken with my Mormon family for over a decade (despite them continuing to send missionaries to harass me). The shit I know and endured.......", "Hey, I guess we could say that about any religion lol.", "Yeah! That's pretty much the same idea as baptism/church membership in the presbyterian church! I think most protestant churches have a way to do both, it's just more likely that someone actually does both in an infant baptism church (in my experience at least)", "Interesting! I don't know as much about catholicism but their beliefs on baptism (or just their beliefs in general) tend to be wildly different than in protestant denominations. Protestants don't agree with the belief that infants need to be baptized to wash away their sin because that would make salvation dependant on works (the act of baptism), and Christianity is a religion of grace/faith not works. Most protestants believe that there is grace for those who die & are incapable of understanding religion and making choices, for example infants, young children, mentally handicapped people, etc", "And I got to tell you man, I 100% totally agree with you and would never argue that you're doing the wrong thing, it just saddens me that we live in a world where people are so much more interested in being accepted by a group of people like the Mormon church to a point where it actually offends and drives their family away. I mean they literally put the church over every other thing in their lives.", "Oh. Without a doubt. In fact, some of the most extreme atheists are an organized anti-religion that had its own issues. You are 100% correct.", "You mean they put their own self-righteous narcissism over every other thing in their lives. Nothing makes me angrier than being spoken to in that \"Oh poor you, if only you could open your heart to the true gospel, you could finally be haaaapppyyyyyy and perfect like I am\" tone of voice.", "Right!?! EXACTLY!", "I\u2019m actually going NAH. That\u2019s because baptism of the dead is a nonsense thing, like numerology and werewolves. Yeah, your mom was opposed to practice and made her views clear during life. But\u2026 she\u2019s dead, yes? Gone to nothing, yes? So she can be neither hurt nor offended by \u201cbaptism\u201d anymore, yes?? Like, ok, your bro sucked for mentioning it during turkey day in a public way (damn that Mormon pussy must off the HOOK) but if hypothetically they\u2019d never same mentioned it\u2026 c\u2019mon, does is fucking matter?", "NTA. That\u2019s beyond creepy and doesn\u2019t actually convert someone.", "NTA- I\u2019d absolutely lose my shit if someone did this to my mother or my partner, (thankfully no one in the family would, Mormons aren\u2019t exactly a common spectacle in the UK). They\u2019re lucky they only got an earful of words and not an earful of fist in my opinion.", "NTA. Ex-mormon here. I was a proxy for many baptisms and it makes me sick to think about it too this day.  The LDS church does not believe in consent  just total obediance. It's a cult.", "Def NTA. Me Exmo, spouse Nevermo. When I confronted him with the possibility of him being baptized after death his response was \"what do I care, I'm dead and I don't beleive in their dogma! No skin off my back!\" It's funny but I agree with him. If someome decides to postem-mortem baptize me into the church of The Flying Spagetti Monster, or other, I don't think I'm gonna sweat it before or after. I think God cares more about my heart than if or when I was dunked, or dunked in name only.\n\nIn all honesty the lds folks think they are giving you and your mom a gift. Tell them its no gift to you or your mom, and  ask for them to drop the subject forever.

They research EVERBODY; The 'unbaptized' go on the list, so it's not always family that submits the name. (Although they can submit names!) \n\nTheir act DOES NOT make your mother baptized.

Naturally, there are going to be uncomfortable impasses about who should get to pray about what.  The folks wanting to say these goofy prayers may believe that it\u2019s the right thing to do and may also feel that those prayers are efficacious.  I tend to side with you, that perhaps honoring someone\u2019s wishes shows more love and respect.  But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the difference in opinion that defines who is the asshole.

The Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, and deemed the baptism irrevocable, so he was taken from his parents. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortara_case"]}
