My brother married an LDS woman and converted soon after. I am agnostic.\n\nLDS doctrine allows for \u201cbaptism of the dead\u201d. It's common, and not spoken of often.

I found this whole thing kind of creepy and weird like most things LDS, so I didn't think much of it. My mother? Not happy at all! Not about the baptism itself, she was pissed they never asked her what our dad would want. She made it VERY clear that he was never to \u201cbaptize\u201d her. Net even in death.

Shortly after we ate, I was playing video games with my nephews, and they mentioned they missed their aunt, and were glad they had baptized her a few years ago. I WAS PISSED but held my cool until most people had left. Then, I got very openly angry with my brother and his wife. Some of the family was still there and began to gather against me. Literally everybody except the couple friends I brought with me were basically telling me how much of a jerk I am for bringing it up at all. I made the point that this discussion took place between my brother and our mother long before this and he was very aware that my mother would not have wanted this and did not approve of it. Of course, they all brought up the same argument that why does it matter if she's dead? They just could not understand my point about respecting her wishes\u2026wishes she made clear.\n\nThis soon became a conversation that every Mormon in the house felt they had a stake in. They were all telling me how much of a jerk I am for being angry with my brother and his wife for doing it.

I argued that what they did was a huge disrespect to her wishes, but to them, I was just an asshole\u2026well, in fairness, they won\u2019t say that word, but they did call me an arse.

During the argument I had with the family on this I actually brought that up. It was something else I learned about LDS, and I can't even say I respect it but it's definitely different. They don't baptize their children until they're eight years old. They claim it's so their children have some semblance of what religion is but who knows what the actual reason is. I had a friend of mine who was Catholic once tell me that they baptized their children not only so that they're saved by God but so that the children feel some sense of obligation to stay in the religion all of their lives. Don't know if that's true but it tracks.

It\u2019s their heart felt belief, just because you don\u2019t understand it, or even don\u2019t like it, doesn\u2019t make them dumb or evil. Just saying.\n\nThere are ALOT of Mormons who are way smarter and way nicer then you or me.", "Well, one is better than none <wicked grin>", "Of course! Sorry for the long answer but it's a topic i think is really interesting:)\n\nSo as you probably know adult baptism is a way of publicly showing your faith in Christ, which means that baptizing babies makes no sense because they obviously don't understand religion and don't have any faith to profess.\n\nBUT for chuches that do infant baptism they don't consider it to be a profession of faith but the sign of the covenant. So how in the old testament circumcision is a symbol of the covenant between God and Abraham, now that we're under the new covenant with Jesus we have a new symbol - baptism. So babies are baptized not because they're Christians already, but as a way for their parents to say that they're going to be raised in the family of God & the new covenant. And that hopefully those children with grow up to share their parents faith but they don't have to (obviously). \n\nSo the confusion comes from the fact that both types of churches are using the same symbol (baptism) for different things (public profession of faith/sign of the new covenant). Churches that do infant baptism see church membership as the public profession/way to share a testimony depending on church, which is equivalent to how adult baptism churches see baptism. And for churches that adult baptism the equivalent to infant baptism would be like a baby dedication/christening (?? less sure about that one i don't think it's as common to have a 'sign of the covenant' equivalent).\n\nAnd a scripture justification for infant baptism (the only one i remember off the top of my head but i know there's others lol) is Acts 16:33 \" At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptized.\" because the baptism of an entire household would have almost definitely included infants/kids too young to understand. And scripture justification for adults baptism is that Jesus was baptized as an adult/the people who we explicitly see baptized in the Bible are adults.", "And if you're curious (and not tired of listening to me lol) i personally don't think either is biblically 'wrong' and it's a matter of how you interpret what's in the Bible & what symbolism you like better which way you choose. Personally I prefer infant baptism because I love the symbolism of it being a way to mark children as part of the covenant before they can even remotely understand what that means. But that being said, i was baptized as an adult in a church that practices infant baptism", "Actually I made it a point to learn everything I could about the Mormons when my brother decided to convert. Sadly I read way more than I ever would have wanted to. Some of it was humorous like their masturbation pamphlets for teens and the anti-gay stuff from the 90s that aren't around anymore, but yeah believe me I already did that deep dive and would never want to do it again. Scary shit they do. The funny thing is that the things most people think they know about the Mormons isn't true but if they knew the actual stuff, they'd be mortified and horrified.", "There was a little sarcasm in my last comment but I have just come to my own personal belief and conclusion that anyone who buys into the thinking and rituals like many the LDS church doctrine says...kinda makes me think there's a screw loose...somewhere.", "I was Episcopalian, and baptism there is seen as making you a child of God (my understanding of it at least). It showed I was part of the covenant and the community. Then at 12 I was confirmed, which seems to be similar to adult baptism, it was to profess that I was agreeing to be part of the church and stand by my faith. I think Catholicism is similar, they\u2019re big on infant baptisms because from my understanding only baptized people go to heaven. Then the confirmation is you agreeing with the initial baptism.", "that's really interesting. I was raised Roman Catholic (no longer practicing) and was taught that infants are baptized to wash away original sin. Parents extend their faith on their child\u2019s behalf as infants cannot profess faith and be saved themselves. I don't know how true this is, but I was told we baptize so young because infant mortality rates used to be so high, and if original sin wasn't cleansed, then the child wouldn't go to Heaven.", "Absolutely. There are many legitimate reasons why I haven't spoken with my Mormon family for over a decade (despite them continuing to send missionaries to harass me). The shit I know and endured.......", "Hey, I guess we could say that about any religion lol.", "Yeah! That's pretty much the same idea as baptism/church membership in the presbyterian church! I think most protestant churches have a way to do both, it's just more likely that someone actually does both in an infant baptism church (in my experience at least)", "Interesting! I don't know as much about catholicism but their beliefs on baptism (or just their beliefs in general) tend to be wildly different than in protestant denominations. Protestants don't agree with the belief that infants need to be baptized to wash away their sin because that would make salvation dependant on works (the act of baptism), and Christianity is a religion of grace/faith not works. Most protestants believe that there is grace for those who die & are incapable of understanding religion and making choices, for example infants, young children, mentally handicapped people, etc", "And I got to tell you man, I 100% totally agree with you and would never argue that you're doing the wrong thing, it just saddens me that we live in a world where people are so much more interested in being accepted by a group of people like the Mormon church to a point where it actually offends and drives their family away. I mean they literally put the church over every other thing in their lives.", "Oh. Without a doubt. In fact, some of the most extreme atheists are an organized anti-religion that had its own issues. You are 100% correct.", "You mean they put their own self-righteous narcissism over every other thing in their lives. Nothing makes me angrier than being spoken to in that \"Oh poor you, if only you could open your heart to the true gospel, you could finally be haaaapppyyyyyy and perfect like I am\" tone of voice.", "Right!?! EXACTLY!", "I\u2019m actually going NAH. That\u2019s because baptism of the dead is a nonsense thing, like numerology and werewolves. Yeah, your mom was opposed to practice and made her views clear during life. But\u2026 she\u2019s dead, yes? Gone to nothing, yes? So she can be neither hurt nor offended by \u201cbaptism\u201d anymore, yes?? Like, ok, your bro sucked for mentioning it during turkey day in a public way (damn that Mormon pussy must off the HOOK) but if hypothetically they\u2019d never same mentioned it\u2026 c\u2019mon, does is fucking matter?", "NTA.

They\u2019re lucky they only got an earful of words and not an earful of fist in my opinion.", "NTA. Ex-mormon here. I was a proxy for many baptisms and it makes me sick to think about it too this day.  The LDS church does not believe in consent  just total obediance. It's a cult.", "Def NTA. Me Exmo, spouse Nevermo. When I confronted him with the possibility of him being baptized after death his response was \"what do I care, I'm dead and I don't beleive in their dogma! No skin off my back!\" It's funny but I agree with him. If someome decides to postem-mortem baptize me into the church of The Flying Spagetti Monster, or other, I don't think I'm gonna sweat it before or after. I think God cares more about my heart than if or when I was dunked, or dunked in name only.\n\nIn all honesty the lds folks think they are giving you and your mom a gift. Tell them its no gift to you or your mom, and  ask for them to drop the subject forever.

They research EVERBODY; The 'unbaptized' go on the list, so it's not always family that submits the name. (Although they can submit names!) \n\nTheir act DOES NOT make your mother baptized. Some lds dude is being dunked all tues evening at the temple, while bearing the name(s) of multiple people and strangers.  That's it. Just acknowledge the weirdness.", "NTA if it didn\u2019t \u201cmatter\u201d because she\u2019s dead then why did THEY do it? They contradicted themselves. She said herself that she didn\u2019t want that & your brother knew it but did it anyway. That makes me sick.", "I don't think you can convert corpses.

The reason I think it bugs me so much is because my mother went out of her way to make sure that my brother's transition to LDS did not affect their relationship, at least as much as possible. She still retained a good relationship with him and she adored his wife as well. I think that's where the anger comes in, that my mother made such an effort to make sure that the peace was held even when so many times we were told how wrong we were for the way we lived or the way we did things. The funny thing is that actually goes against Mormon teachings as well or at least they'll tell you it does. But I think that's where the majority of my anger comes in, it's just like all of that was ignored and disrespected. The act itself is truly not bugging me.", "ROFL. You're eliminated a paradox there. Love it. Great perspective and even better comment. Thank you.", "ex-mo here!  you are NTA at all!   They disrespected your mother's explicit wishes to do that.  It is like saying that respect for others ends at death. \n\nWould they like it if you went around telling people that you consider your dead LDS relatives to be a different faith now???", "irrelevant that the body is not used.   Are you even LDS??  They can baptize people who died centuries ago.  They used her NAME, her MEMORY in their temple work against her express wishes.  \n\nAs someone else pointed out in another comment here, the Mormons were baptizing people who died in the Holocaust and were told to stop.  They were baptizing people who had no relationship to anyone in the church, and that is an issue.  Likewise, they baptized someone who said not to.", "Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not defending what was done or saying that OP shouldn\u2019t be upset.

OP absolutely has the right to be upset, but doesn\u2019t need to be upset on behalf of their mother, who cannot be affected by anything at this point.", "The problem with the Mormons telling each other that they're giving the person the option to accept thr baptism or not is that it becomes the excuse to trample all over people's wishes. \n\nLike I said, I've had to do plenty of baptisms for the dead in my early teens to my mid-teens. The way they brag about how it made them feel and how great they are for bestowing this \"favor\" on others is a pat on the back. I'm sure there are plenty of people who believe they're helping those who have passed on, but it is DEFINITELY not the only reason why they do this.", "Yup.

It was added to LDS Doctrine in 1830 following the discovery of a Mormon man who had married a young  child, believed to be 9 or 10 years old at the time. In the end, the man was spared excommunication, or any punishment to be honest, because it was determined that the girl who was had reached the \"age of accountability\" . It was shortly after this event that it was added to doctrine. It also goes further when Joseph Smith was found to have married a 14 year old child, Helen Kimball, in 1843. The marriage had been hidden from everybody in the church by the girl continuing to live with her parents, while Smith would \"visit to to consummate\" their marriage often, at the parents home. Once the marriage was discovered, Smith also revived the \"age of accountability\" to excuse his actions. It was only after this that the term was morphed into what it is today. It's origins are much more murky and sickening. Today it's taught as a positive thing when it's history is in fact deep dark and disgusting.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Mar_Kimball", "Thanks for the info!", "Thank you.

I'm not interested in that, sorry.", "Yeah it sounds like you got thrown into the Belly of the fire without ever wanting to be. Glad your husband wasn't practicing cuz it could have been so much worse. He would have been pushing you and trying to do everything he could to convert you. That is how they work. It's either Mormon missionaries going far away from their homes to recruit or recruiting from within and growing the religion through marriage and procreation. Either way they try to get you. Sounds like you learned a lot of things you probably didn't care to ever know. I definitely know how you feel there.", "Not sure about other Christian faiths, but here's another tid-bit...\n\nCatholics have another sacrament, Confirmation,  for older children (typically around 13). It's kind of like saying, \"My parents dedicated me to God when I was a baby, and fulfilled their obligation to bring up in the church. Now that I'm old enough to have a say, I'm choosing to take on the responsibility myself.\"\n\nPersonally,  I'm not Confirmed, because I felt like it was a HUGE responsibility that I wasn't ready for. Luckily, my parents were supportive of my decision. I know several kids that were told they were getting confirmed, and that was that. \n\nBTW, thanks for all the info. Knowledge is power!", "that is correct.  the baptism of the dead does not automatically enter the desceased on the membership rolls of the church.  \n\nHowever, by continuing down the road.... the LDS are so firmly entrenched that they are the true church that they pretty much assume those on the other side will accept it. \n\nWait!!! There's more, everyone including OP!! \n\nThere's not just baptism for the dead!  They do other ceremonies for the dead too including endowments and the pre-endowment ceremony called the initatory, and sealing spouses (mormon temple wedding), and sealing children to the parents.  All of this can be done for a desceased person in the temple. It does not stop at baptism.  \n\nIf they baptized the OP's mom a few years ago, then they probably did all the other temple ceremonies already too.", "But surely then, my point about private prayer/contemplation vs. public ceremony stands. One is for personal expression of grief the other is to achieve a separate goal - whether that\u2019s a religious or political goal, whether it\u2019s for financial profit or to increase followers/popularity is sort of besides the point.
