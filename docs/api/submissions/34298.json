Him finishing his route at 4:30pm instead of 3:30pm would not have caused any issues. I was NOT asking him to jeopardize his job in any way. It would be helpful to me if we could take that out of the equation since it is irrelevant to our situation. \n\nAlso ETA\nI wasn\u2019t asking him to come home and put the collar on for me. I was asking him to come home and be an extra set of hands to get it back on together. Which we did later when he got him and luckily the cat hadn\u2019t managed to rip open her stitches. \n\nMy husband words for FEDEX and he delivers about 15 minutes from our house. I am a teacher and off work this week so I am at home. We just got our cat spayed and she has to wear this ecollar so she won\u2019t lick the surgical site. It was my first day home with her after surgery and she got the ecollar off. Not only that, but she was under the bed out of reach licking herself. I spent the better part of an hour catching her and trying to get it back on and tightened with the little string, but she would flail and flop around like a fish and I was afraid she was going to hurt herself. She is still on strong pain meds so I don\u2019t know how much she could feel. We don\u2019t have extra money and the thought of having to go back to the vet for another procedure if she ripped open her stitches or worse licked it open and who knows what was very concerning to me. So I was panicking. I was following her around clapping every time she tried to lick it and trying everything I could think of to hold her and get it back on. \n\nAnyways, in a moment of sheer frustration and worry, I call my husband and basically ask him to \u201cbreak route\u201d and he calls it and drive his truck over to our house and come help me. At this point he is about 2 hours from finishing his day. But the thought of dealing with this cat trying to lick herself and potentially opening her stitches for 2 more hours had me super upset. He could have been to our house and back to his route in less than an hour. And he finishes by 3:30 every day anyways, so it\u2019s not like it would have put him finishing in the dark or something. \n\nHe refused and I told him it frustrates me that he will never inconvenience himself to help me and I hung up. \n\nHe came home livid at ME, telling me how incredibly selfish I was for even asking him for the favor. And now we aren\u2019t talking and I\u2019m over here feeling like the asshole.

But I watched my husband try and do things for our pets but give up after 3 minutes of trying when he gets nervous or our pet struggles. E collars really aren't hard to put on even a struggling animal and watching a short video or even holding kitty for a couple of hours or keeping them in a carrier would have done the trick... You said yourself he was off in less than two hours. You also said it would take him less than an hour so I assume about an hour to come home and go back. So about 25 min each way assuming it takes 5 minutes to put the collar on. So basically forcing him to work an hour longer because you are frustrated? Also assuming his work doesn't care which they probably do. That's a little unreasonable. Like I get being frustrated and don't blame you but he's not the one in the wrong here since he was at work and you had a lot of better options.\n\nAnimals especially cats also sense anxiety, spending 5 minutes sitting with them quietly likely would have relaxed them enough for you to get the collar back on.

Let them know I was frustrated, but that doesn\u2019t excuse how I spoke. None of that seemed to have happened. You got frustrated, yelled, and hung up because your partner set a boundary (doesn\u2019t matter if you think it\u2019s reasonable or not, it\u2019s his job. He works there not you. Similarly, if the situation was reversed I would say the same thing). This wasn\u2019t an emergency. And you couldn\u2019t handle his decision and boundary. \n\nMain point here is, though, that I\u2019m pretty sure he would not have reacted that way upon coming home if you had not yelled and hung up on him.

They are under tremendous pressure to deliver on time. They are closely monitored.

This is a fireable offense for FedEx. They\u2019re great company to work for and compensate very well. Advancement is also good. So, your husband cannot and will not jeopardize his career for a violation that he\u2019d hear about at the end of his shift (yes, that closely monitored). \n\nSo, if you maybe thought he was not telling truth about those facts, or failed to tell you, please understand he really cannot come home.

He is the absolute sweetest boy  normally but he was abandoned by his previous owner and is TERRIFIED of the cat carrier. He would just dart back and forth between the closet and under the bed. Every time I did catch him, he'd get loose and I'd get scratched. I HAD to get him out of there, my friend was downstairs waiting to pick me up and I was so tired.

He could probably break route but he either has to be close to his route (so he could get back in time), already on his break/lunch, or he has to get permission to break his route/end his route early. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And he finishes by 3:30 every day anyways, \n\nUgh, maybe because he is done delivering all of his packages by that time.\n\nDelivery drivers faces a lot of unpredictable scenarios every day, from traffic jams, the number of packages to be delivered, to being delegated a different route, trucks breaking down, etc. things that will set them back. Many also deliver to factories/warehouses, stores, offices, where there's a certain time where they stop accepting packages for that day.  \n\nHe may not be directly under FedEx but he still works for them.", "This is actually true because fedex ground leverages contractors to avoid having anyone officially on payroll. No actual employees = no opportunity to unionize.", "It\u2019s both? There are several contractors but they all deliver for FEDEX. That\u2019s the best way I can explain it.", "This one got a chuckle out of me.", "Yup, what they said.   \n\n\nIt feels like weaponized incompetence honestly and if I were in his position I would be upset and being \"yelled at\" (maybe not literally but clearly in an argumentative hostile way \"talked to\" and hung up on) for stating a clear boundary at what was kind of a ridiculous request. Like from his perspective OP started a fight with him, hung up on him, then further stood their ground on the ridiculous request, and continued mud-slinging and emotional manipulation because they did not like his boundary. If I were him I'd be mad too and probably say similar to her.", "I just wanted the collar back on so she couldn\u2019t rip open her stitches. I just needed help getting it back on.", "I'm confident that NONE of you saying she should have just figured it out has ever tried putting a cone on a cat. A dog, sure it's easy, but a cat will literally tear you the fuck up if you try to force them into something when they're stressed and scared. I've had to put cones on many cats in my life and while most were fairly easy, one cat I have now 100% required two sets of hands to do without getting clawed up by her.", "There was not really anything to figure out. It was a 2 person job. Even later when he got home we had to put it on together.

It\u2019s not about the cat. It\u2019s about feeling like honestly neither of us ever seems willing to inconvenience ourselves for each other. And we both only seem to see our side of things. So I was trying to get a third party point of view. Which I\u2019m having a hard time getting because everything thinks I was either asking him to jeopardize his job or they are focusing on the fact that I needed help with a cat which they think it dumb but entirely not the point.", "I ask this with sincerity. You\u2019re saying that me getting upset and hanging up was emotional manipulation?", "He didn\u2019t say no because he was worried about work. He said no because he didn\u2019t want to take the time to come help me.", "I actually have a toddler and am doing just fine. Thanks.", "I wish I could explain it better. He does work for fedex, through a contractor. Each contractor has their own routes and rules. Fedex is like the big umbrella, that\u2019s the best I can explain it.", "Wow I was just reading your other comment and really taking it in. And even thought about thanking you for a mature and thoughtful reply. Like I didn\u2019t feel attacked even though you were agreeing that I was wrong.", "Yes. This is correct. He has actually considered switching to UPS for this very reason.", "Weaponized incompetence? This stupid term is used waaay too much. Have any of you people calling her an asshole ever in your life tried to put a cone on a cat who doesn't want it? It is EXTREMELY fucking difficult. My cat got hers off after a surgery too and it sure as shit took both my husband and I to get it back on her. If either of us had tried on our own without being able to wrap her in a towel and hold her still we would've been scratched to hell and put her at further risk of injury too.", "Was there nobody else for you to call? I'd imagine you could have called a friend or a neighbor to ask for a quick favor instead of your husband who was on the clock.\n\nI don't think you're TA for asking, but YTA if you expected him to say yes, unless you had absolutely nobody else to call AND you were responsible for the cat even after he came home.", "No one said it was easy. We said you don\u2019t expect your spouse to come home in the middle of their workday and then have the audacity to get mad at them when they (reasonably) say no.", "Ha!

You\u2019ve never seen someone wrap a cat in a towel? You don\u2019t own a cat carrier? If you truthfully could not possibly get the collar on than put her in the carrier for the 2 hours so you can watch her like a hawk. Her \u201cflailing and flopping like a fish\u201d isn\u2019t really reason enough not to pin her and do it anyway, but at minimum problem solve another solution.

Ugh", "OP fuck all these people. Most on this sub are teenagers with very little life experience. I have 100% needed two people to put a cone back on a scared, stressed cat after surgery. Had I not had help I would've been scratched to hell and in my frustration could've likely hurt her in the process. I also disagree that it wasn't time sensitive. It's not an emergency in that the cat would've died but it's extremely stressful to sit and worry for hours that your cat is unknowingly injuring themselves. You worry about them and you worry about the financial aspect of course because vets are completely unreasonable. If I were your husband (I'm gay so sorry we can't trade lol) I would have definitely come to help because I care more about my cat than I care about being reprimanded at a job. It's easy enough to make up a bullshit excuse to a boss if needed. He could've simply said you locked yourself out and he had to stop at home to let you in. Shit happens in life and you know if your employer is one that understands that.", "Bingo", "I think you aren't getting the support you were hoping for.  Really it all comes down to the fact that you couldn't compose yourself for 5 mins to figure out how to handle this situation, so he should come home, fix it for you, and go back to work extending his work day by an hour instead of you waiting 2.  And really, it would have only saved you 90 mins, cause it would have taken him 30 mins to get there.  And let's also consider that maybe he was in the middle of a large delivery that might have taken him time to finish.  Now he is working an extra hour, so you don't have to deal with the extra hour of \"work\".", "Definitely sounds like a bigger picture conversion. It's so, so easy in a long term relationship to start taking each other for granted. Daily tasks eat away at each person and it feels sometimes like it's too much to then start considering the other person too. Sounds like this is just one example of a broader issue. I think if you bring this to him as a both of you issue you'll have better luck actually talking about this.", "That and telling him that he never inconveniences himself for you.  Hes working.

YTA.\n\nUpdate:  My friends that work for FEDEX got back to me.  They said what you get away with and what is OK are not the same.  Any complaint can cause an investigation, sub or not.

Again, not earth shattering wrong, but wrong in the sense that a \u201chey, I freaked out and shouldn\u2019t have done that\u201d was pretty obvious.

And lame is very tame on the list of insults to use. But it\u2019s not necessary to use any higher language, because I don\u2019t know you, it\u2019s not the end of the world, you\u2019re not evil, but the way you\u2019ve been replying has been very lame. \n\nI apologize if you feel attacked, but if the \u201cman you\u2019re lame\u201d in response to one of your MANY comments repeating the same thing, where in my post I don\u2019t even feel like I said anything special or unique to other posters, then this feels more like okay well this is how you\u2019re making me feel and I don\u2019t like it aka prioritizing myself vs am I being the asshole here", "Incompetence doesnt mean thing is easy.

Do people know their neighbors these days? Haha", "We can agree to disagree then. If I knew my cat was licking at a fresh wound I'd be fairly useless at work because all I'd be able to think about was her opening her wound up. My cat means more to me than 2 hours of work and fortunately I work at a place that wouldn't mind in the slightest if I had to leave early to take care of it. Sounds like OPs husband is in a similar position. Of course some employers would flip out but to act like the majority of working people in the US would be fired if they had to suddenly leave a couple hours early to take care of a potentially injured pet is just ridiculous. Not all managers have no heart, we are all human beings after all.", "Bullshit. The cat just had anesthesia, which for humans who actually understand what's going on can be extremely jarring, then woke up with new pain and a wound that wasn't there preciously. That is fucking stressful for an animal. They lick because that's what their instinct tells them to do but all it does is further harm their recover which is why cones are so important. She did the right fucking thing by trying to put the cone on. Jesus I hope none of you own cats because you clearly don't know what the hell you're talking about. If she made a post saying she just couldn't do it so she left her cat alone all day to lick open her wound you people would be vilifying her for abusing a cat so there's literally no winning here.", "Old enough to be a school teacher, somehow.", "Well for this cat it was. Idk what else to tell you.", "Im not an teenager - I think OP was being an AH.", "I hear you. I really do!

It just felt like everyone was focusing on that which to me meant I wasn\u2019t getting the real answer I was looking for. Am I the asshole in OUR situation (where his job was not at risk whatsoever).. so I guess I was just getting frustrated feeling like my whole post was wasted because people don\u2019t want to believe what I am saying and thus calling me an asshole for something that isn\u2019t even true. That\u2019s where the defensiveness comes in.

Weaponized means you're not actually incompetent, you're just feigning incompetence so you get help/attention. That's clearly not what was happening here even if people keep saying it over and over. It's a poor woman who didn't want to cause her cat to become injured and she reached out to her husband for help when she couldn't do it alone. People are vilifying her for it which I just don't understand. I see a woman at her wits end with worry about her pet. If she'd posted saying she gave up and just let her cat lick open the wound she would also be villified because reddit can be a terrible place, especially this subreddit frequented by very young users who don't even have the life experience to speak on many of these topics.", "They certainly have friends.", "As u/SnooAvocados6793 said, you\u2019re trying to avoid that you\u2019re wrong.
