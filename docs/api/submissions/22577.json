We met at work a few years ago. Lonely guy without many friends so I took him under my wing to help him meet others & be more social. I used to take him out fishing on my boat on our days off & would invite him over to dinner with my girlfriend & I. He took to me like wildfire & wanted to spend all of his free time together. I had other responsibilities to other family & friends so I wouldn\u2019t be able to commit as often as he would like & this would often hurt his feelings. Fast forward about a year & I had a great job opportunity elsewhere about 6 hours away (had been at my previous company 10 years). He freaked at the thought of losing his one close friend, even though I had been more distant for quite some time. I knew several of the managers at the new company & with my reference was able to get him a job interview. He did well & got the job in a different department. We both relocated & due to me working nightshift & in a different department we don\u2019t see each other as often as he would like. Plus, I bought a house\u2026have two parents with health problems & a serious girlfriend so most of my free time was already accounted for. During the transition, my parents let him stay at their house for a couple of weeks. Long story short, he ends up quitting his job without notice because they were changing his schedule after being hospitalized & out sick for almost a month. During that time, I would text him daily to ask if he needed anything food or medicine wise. Shortly after quitting, he asks me to borrow $250 bucks. Sure, no problem. I told him that didn\u2019t expect him to pay that back. A few months later he asks me to borrow another $250 after he had $3000 stolen from his account stolen. Sure, no problem. I didn\u2019t tell him that I didn\u2019t expect that to be paid back. I ended up in the hospital with Salmonella a few months later. He asks me to write him a reference letter to Med School while I was in the hospital since I used to be his Supervisor. No problem. Afterwards, I don\u2019t hear anything from him until he texts me asking to co-sign a loan for him to go to medical school since he got accepted. I told him that I wasn\u2019t comfortable taking on that financial responsibility. In response, he made it seem as if it\u2019s my fault that he isn\u2019t able to go to school now. He is unemployed, hasn\u2019t paid me back any of the money he already borrowed & never checked on me when I was sick in the hospital until he needed something. AITA for not being comfortable doing this for him? Or is he, for asking me to do it in the first place? I\u2019ve tried to do everything that I can to be a good friend to him but co-signing a huge loan for years just feels like too much. I feel guilty. Any feedback is welcome. \n\nTLDR: My friend is asking me to co-sign his loan to med school.

Everyone has to struggle and grow from those struggles. \n\nYou really should not have gone to an extent of getting him transferred to where you are. Did you not see how co-dependent he is on you? Such relations never end well for any of the parties involved. Cosigning a loan is a huge ask at that. He already doesn't seem to be very responsible financially and professionally.

Your response - that you weren't comfortable taking on that kind of financial responsibility - was perfect and entirely reasonable. His response, trying to make you feel responsible for his inability to go to med school, was ridiculous and again inappropriate.

Besides it being a ridiculous request, that you\u2019ll be bound to him for a long time, he might also be a quitter. He relocated when you did, if you move again, would he switch medical schools?

This is not an 18 year old with no credit, this is an adult with bad credit. Medical school is outrageously expensive, so those loans are going to be h-u-g-e, and there's a good chance you'd end up on the hook to pay it back.\n\nSecondly, even if you're only a co-signer, that goes into your credit profile/rating. Depending on your current credit rating, being co-signer could make the difference between getting the best interest rate and getting the worst rate reserved for poor risks. \n\nIn short, you should never co-sign a loan for someone else, unless maybe for your child. \n\nThe fact that he owes you money is irrelevant here.

Asking you to basically go guarantor for a loan making you responsible for his debt if he defaults is outrageous. This guy is a yawning money pit and seems only to pop up when he wants something from you. Walk away.", "No, nope, no, nada, non, uh-uh, absolutely not.  The lending institute doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s a good risk and they\u2019re insured but somehow this is a good idea for you?", "NTA\n\nI agree with the top post that all this backstory is irrelevant, he could be the greatest, nicest friend in the world and it would still be totally reasonable to say \"I can't take on this risk\". Co-signing isn't some game, it's legally binding yourself to a debt.", "NTA. You do not Not NOT need to take on the burden of this person's debt. Not only because they are just taking and taking from you (get his hand out of your pocket, man!) and not reciprocating in any way. Not only was this a completely unreasonable request, but he's got massive nerve to even think if asking. \n\nI cosigned a car loan with my son and it's making me twitchy. I can't even imagine being on the hook for $200k.\n\nBe a broken record of No. Put it on repeat and cut him out of your life. \n\nI can't imagine why he doesn't have more friends. </sarcasm filter off>", "NTA That's a huge amount of money. That would jeopardize your future. What if something happens to him? You would still be liable.", "\nNTA - \nAs a former worker in the consumer finance industry, I can tell you from having seen it all, NEVER CO-SIGN ANYTHING FOR ANYBBODY FOR ANY REASON!  \n\nI can see this going very bad for you in a number of ways.  The most likely being that he runs up a lot of debt, doesn't finish med school and decides he doesn't want to pay.  His history of quitting things (like jobs) when things get tough makes this likely.", "NTA. \n\nI suspect a scam.", "NTA - your not a friend, your a mark.  Do you actually have proof he got into Med school? Doesn\u2019t matter.  Just say no", "NTA. Also, if you\u2019re in the Us, medschool loans are available federally without any co-signers. Something is suspicious here.", "NTA. I wouldn't co-sign a loan for my brother (we get along) let alone a friend. And a bad friend at that.\n\nBut also, there are loan options for people with bad credit\u2026", "NTA.  Thats a huge commitment and not one that should really even be asked of family, let alone a somewhat distant friend.  The $250 is ultimately irrelevant to me but does show a pattern.", "Most likely he is going to overseas medical school with heavy tuition."]}
