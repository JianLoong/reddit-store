One of my sisters is 6f \u2018anna\u2019. we happen to share a birthday (unfortunately). In my family, we have a tradition where the birthday person gets to choose every meal of that day. My mom, instead of celebrating on two separate days, instead just gave Anna to decide the supper and me to decide the breakfast, for the past 4 years.

That limited my options for breakfast by a lot (the max time she would cook was 10 minutes for the whole family) so I usually get stuck just picking usual breakfast food. Meanwhile Anna gets to pick literally whatever she wants for the supper, plus dessert. I think it\u2019s unfair. I wouldn\u2019t mind if we switched off every year, or had two celebrations so we each got our own day, but my mom said no. \n\nOur birthday is in a few days, and I asked my mom if I could pick the supper and Anna pick the breakfast for once, but she got really mad at me. She kept saying I was trying to rip \u2018my little baby sister\u2019 off and it was fair because I had gotten 12 years previously of choosing (I think this is illogical bc she\u2019ll have had 18 years of it). I asked her if she could make something I actually wanted for the breakfast then, but she said she didn\u2019t have time for anything \u2018extravagant\u2019 and our microwave was broken so she couldn\u2019t reheat something. Then she shooed me away. \n\nWhen my dad got home he was told about it and he told me he\u2019s really disappointed, Anna is really little and I should just be nice for her birthday. Besides that, I should know better than to change the routine on everyone so abruptly.

They are short changing both of you out of the family tradition, but especially you. They are failing at basic parenting 101, not showing favoritism. They are the assholes.\n\nUnfortunately, at 16, there\u2019s not a whole lot you can do about it. I would save some money if I were you and treat yourself to a special birthday dinner out with a friend or two the day before or after your birthday. \n\nYou deserve your own special day just for you.

The birthday is on the same day every year. The same amount of meals are happening. \n\nHappy early birthday, and don\u2019t let them gaslight you on this.

Let's face it, you only had 11 years because on year 12, your mom was having your sister.\n\nAnd there is 0 reason why they can't split the days you get to pick dinner. 0.

So you are a castaway\u2026it is silly not to have two different dates to celebrate what you with more sophisticated taste buds is not what a six year old wants. They are playing favorites and you found out you are not theirs by a long shot. Also, where do you live that Uber eats or door dash or regular restaurant delivery isn\u2019t a thing.

You should BOTH feel special on your birthday, and this tradition is clearly making you feel shortchanged. I\u2019m a parent, and I get how busy and exhausting things can be, but they need to pay attention and see how they\u2019re making you feel. I highly doubt that you\u2019re \u201cnot the favorite/golden child\u201d as others have suggested. Your parents love you, and should understand how hurtful and unfair this feels - especially for a big birthday like your 16th.\n\nSide story: my son was born on my 37th birthday. Even in my 40s, my own wonderful parents drive 4 hours to see us, and buy us separate birthday cakes so that we both feel loved and get to enjoy our favorite desserts on our special day. I actually am old enough at this point that I could do without it, but it means something that they still care like that.\n\nOn the other hand, you\u2019re 16!! COME ON, Mom and Dad!! Don\u2019t let your parents make you feel like you\u2019re not being appreciative, or like you\u2019re somehow too old to deserve the same treatment as your sister. You matter, too.

No way OP was getting a choice at 1.\n\nAnd the choice at 2 was probably a \"choice\" the same way you'd give a 2 year old a choice at a restaurant. You don't hand them the menu and let 'em choose. You pick a couple of items from the menu that you're willing to let them have, and give them a choice between those.\n\nEven at 3 or 4, the sister's choice was probably curated by mom. Maybe by 5 or 6, the choices were less guided. So, it was probably 7-8 years that OP had some real say.\n\nThough I doubt that argument would sway OPs parents. From the sounds, they'd probably just say \"well thats still more than she's gotten\".\n\nAnd lazy is probably a factor. From OPs post, these sound like home cooked meals. The under-6 crowd is going to have more basic tastes than a tween/teen. Burgers, nuggets, mac&cheese would be the order of the day. By even the early teens, complex and/or expensive is distinctly possible.\n\nEspecially with birthdays falling on weeknights, it would be very tempting to let the kid you know is going to select easy meals have the dinner choice. Especially when you're already putting strict limits on what the breakfast choice can be.\n\nIf I read it right, even if OP can't get the dinner choice the year or next, their birthday next year should be on a weekend. Mom will be hard pressed not to give OP a real choice for the breakfast meal.", "my family has the same thing. you can choose to go out for dinner or have something made at home. even as teenagers my sister and i chose", "Yeah I wouldn't be in the house on Anna's birthday ever.
