She is in her 80s and my husband did not want to be very far away from her, and he also wanted to spend more time with her. My parents also live about 4 hours from our new place, so we were both happy about the decision to move.\n\nI\u2019ve never had a good relationship with my MIL, when we visited her she would make snide remarks about how I was a freeloader and wasting my husband\u2019s money because I was a stay at home mom\u2026 and just generally small things, like she would make coffee for everyone except me, etc. So I have really disliked her for years, but I did make a decent effort when we visited to be polite and not make a mess of my husband\u2019s relationship with her. Although sometimes I would complain about her actions to him. But mostly it worked, because it was just for a week or two in a year and I put up with it. \n\nNow that we live nearby, my husband visits her almost every other weekend, which I honestly don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t go, and he doesn\u2019t mind that. But then she kept telling him how unkind and selfish it is of him to not invite her to stay with him, because a good son wouldn\u2019t leave his old mom to live alone, etc etc. So he talked to me about it, and I said she was trying to pressure him and not to give in to it, but he got upset and said that it\u2019s true and the least he can do for his mother is take care of her when she needs it. So I suggested we have her over for a week and see how it goes before committing to anything permanent, because if I\u2019m being honest the idea of living with her all the time sounds like hell. He agreed, she stayed for a week, and it was awful. She said our black cats were bad luck and left the door open when we were not home so they would run away. One of them did run away and I was sick over it, and when we finally found her even my husband was furious with my MIL. Indoor cats don\u2019t know how to survive outdoors and it terrifies me that she could have been crushed by a car. She insulted my cooking nonstop for a few days so I bought her takeout, and then I heard her talking on the phone to a relative saying how I was so lazy I couldn\u2019t even be bothered to cook for the family. After she left my husband and I both agreed that her living with us permanently would not work. So now she lives with a live-in nurse. \n\nRecently she has had worsening health issues and had a minor surgery, it will take a few weeks to recover from it. She very forcefully expressed that she wants stay with us until she recovers. I said no way. My husband is very angry, because he says I barely have any contact with her and I can manage for a few weeks, and it won\u2019t kill me, and that he can\u2019t justify not being there for her when she actually needs it. He thinks I\u2019m being selfish, and I am, but I really cannot stand her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
