Some of his conditions affect his voice, his voice slurs and he stutters sometimes. He is very insecure about this as it means people don't take him seriously, even though he is a very bright kid.\n\nThis Friday evening there was a family gathering at my mother's house. My sister \\[35F\\] and my niece Sarah \\[15F\\] were both there, this is the first time Lucas had seen eachother in a few years and he was excited to see her again. When she arrived Lucas came over and said hello to her, the whole time she had this strange look on her face like she was holding back laughter, and I could tell Lucas was uncomfortable.\n\nThis would happen every time he spoke, she would snigger a little and try to hide it or cover her mouth to hide it. Lucas looked super embarrassed and I was getting angry. Eventually he said he wasn't feeling well and my husband drove him home. My husband texted me telling me Lucas had started crying when he got in as he was super upset after his cousins laughter.\n\nI asked Sarah if she wanted to explain what Lucas had been saying that she found so funny. She went red and didn't answer, my sister said Sarah was just a kid and I couldn't expect her to respond any differently. I told my sister she needed to teach her kid not to be such an ignorant brat, Sarah got angry and said she wasn't a brat. I snapped and told her to shut up and stop acting like one. Sarah and my sister ended up leaving and my parents said I took it too far.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699814406, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tqjio/aita_for_yelling_at_my_niece_after_she_laughed_at/", "score": 2094, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her mom shouldn't have waived it away (because by 15, you really SHOULD know!).  You shouldn't have called her a brat though.\n\nNot that she wasn't, but because that doesn't help Lucas and makes everything adversarial, and the goal is to help Lucas.  If it had been, say, a random down-the-road neighbor, I wouldn't feel this way, but with family, it's better generally to avoid the name calling to get change when it impacts your kid.  Maybe something like, \"Sarah is 15, which is old enough to know that laughing at people will hurt their feelings. If she can't control it, she should also be old enough to excuse herself to get composed. What happened really hurt Lucas and will cause strain on their relationship.

I know at that age my shyness and anxiety led me to be very uncomfortable in a situation where things weren\u2019t predictable (including visits with anyone).  But needing to laugh was a reaction to that. I know probably extreme, but 15 is still pretty volatile.", "Ok so for the record...\n\nI was in my teens when my father remarried and had three kids, my brothers and sister. I'm visually impaired, and my brothers and sister grew up with me, knowing I'm disabled. They became really protective of me, helping me find things, guiding me around obstacles etc. Sometimes they asked about my white cane and other stuff. The youngest of my half siblings, my sister, never ever laughed at me. Occasionally she might become a little frustrated, because she was like, 3, and didn't understand about disability, but never did she ever laugh. \n\nAll this to say that your niece is 15, and should definitely know better. If kids are educated they learn and actually become better people for knowing and understanding disability. It is never too early to teach a kid about disability, even in a small way. \n\nThat being said, I believe the best thing to do would have been to sit down with your niece and explain about your son's disability. Perhaps it might have stopped her from laughing, and made your son less uncomfortable. I've found that parents are worse about disabilities than their children, so talking directly to your sister may not have worked, but talking directly to your niece in a non judgemental fashion would have worked best. \n\nOn the other hand, I can understand why you said what you said. My mother always gets protective of me and my disability too. It's a perfectly normal reaction. \n\nNTA.", "As another mum of a disabled kiddo, absolutely NTA and if my kid had been the one laughing I'd be deeply, deeply ashamed.", " NTA - she\u2019s 15yrs old and well past the age where you learn to not treat those with disabilities differently or laugh at them.", "NTA. She's 15, she should most definitely know better and have some compassion ESPECIALLY as he's her own cousin. Even my 5 year old can be taught about people's differences and not to laugh.

Some of his conditions affect his voice, his voice slurs and he stutters sometimes. He is very insecure about this as it means people don't take him seriously, even though he is a very bright kid.\n\nThis Friday evening there was a family gathering at my mother's house. My sister \\[35F\\] and my niece Sarah \\[15F\\] were both there, this is the first time Lucas had seen eachother in a few years and he was excited to see her again. When she arrived Lucas came over and said hello to her, the whole time she had this strange look on her face like she was holding back laughter, and I could tell Lucas was uncomfortable.\n\nThis would happen every time he spoke, she would snigger a little and try to hide it or cover her mouth to hide it. Lucas looked super embarrassed and I was getting angry. Eventually he said he wasn't feeling well and my husband drove him home. My husband texted me telling me Lucas had started crying when he got in as he was super upset after his cousins laughter.\n\nI asked Sarah if she wanted to explain what Lucas had been saying that she found so funny. She went red and didn't answer, my sister said Sarah was just a kid and I couldn't expect her to respond any differently. I told my sister she needed to teach her kid not to be such an ignorant brat, Sarah got angry and said she wasn't a brat. I snapped and told her to shut up and stop acting like one.
