{"id": 27608, "submission_id": "16rndq6", "title": "AITA for trying to keep my birthday party a secret from a friend?", "selftext": "Throwaway. \n\nBackground: I (32F) have a serious issue with celebrating my birthday. My older brother who was my best friend growing up passed on my birthday and I\u2019ve struggled with that day ever since. Jenna (25F) and I met much after I lost him and we have the same birthday. She\u2019s used to being the one to have parties for her birthday without me being a threat to her attendance. She\u2019s sort of got a main-character attitude. Earlier this year, she moved one state over but is a 6 hour drive or 45 minute flight from the town we both are from. \n\nAfter years of therapy and encouragement from my two best friends and my SO, I\u2019ve decided to throw a birthday party for myself at a local dive I frequent for karaoke. I\u2019ve talked to the bar and the karaoke host, and we are doing a Disney Princess theme (I know, childish, but my guy friends in dresses sounds fun as hell). My friends asked if there was any restrictions to attire, and I simply asked that no one else dress as Belle from Beauty and the Beast or wear a tiara, to which everyone said that was a reasonable request.\n\nThis past weekend Jenna came to town for another friend\u2019s birthday/engagement party. The birthday girl/bride-to-be had one request: she be the only person to wear white. Jenna (who had gotten the same invitation with the same request) wore a white dress. She acted like she had no idea then went off about how \u201cshe\u2019d be wearing white soon enough anyways.\u201d\n\nA lot of us talked and have all decided to put distance between us and her, but some feel like she\u2019s just young and learning. \n\nI put it out that I don\u2019t want Jenna to know about my birthday party. After this weekend, I don\u2019t trust her to show up and expect the party to be \u201cours\u201d and she take over. A group of friends think I\u2019m being rude by excluding her, as it\u2019s her birthday too, but others think I\u2019m in the right. I honestly don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being paranoid or justified in this fear. AITA?\n\nUpdate: I have been talking with one of the bigger advocates for inviting Jenna and trying to convince her that telling Jenna will only result in drama and someone feeling crappy. Her argument is that if Jenna does come home for her birthday to find out I\u2019m having a party and did not include her, I\u2019d be no different than Jenna has been over the last five years. I reiterated that after this weekend, I don\u2019t wish to be friends with Jenna knowing that she can\u2019t let anyone have their own moment, and that telling her a birthday party is already planned will incline her to claim it as her own and potentially getting her feelings hurt worse when half of our friends stop her. Because the party is at a bar (public space), I cannot actively prevent her from showing up outside of keeping the party quiet. She says I\u2019m being selfish and that I shouldn\u2019t be abandoning someone over a fashion mistake.
