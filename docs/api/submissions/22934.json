I told her my name and she told me Hers, she then talked for like 5 minutes About the neighborhood and neighbors etc. I cut her off politely saying I had to get to work but before I left she mentioned a \u201cneighborhood bbq  on Saturday where everyone was welcome and suggested we go. I told her thanks for the invite and jogged to my house 2 doors down. \n\n\n       My husband was up and while we were getting ready I told him about it.

I was confused then she said it was supposed to be a welcome to the neighborhood BBQ for us and we didn\u2019t even bother to show. I told her sorry since I didn\u2019t know but she started babbling about the time and effort and whatnot. Again I  told her if I would have known I would have gone but she called me rude and disrespectful and stomped into her house. I jogged to my house where my husband was waiting with coffee. I told him about the encounter outside and he was weirded out by the welcome bbq  saying who even does Things like that then said oh well we didn\u2019t know so not our fault. I agreed and just went on about our day. \n\n     I called my mom and during the conversation I brought it up she said we should have gone at least for an hour or so to not be rude and I reminded her of how she used to scold me when she would take me to gatherings and I would have a \u201cface\u201d because I didn\u2019t want to be there I told her that now that no one is forcing me to socialize I won\u2019t do it. She called me a brat and our conversation ended. I know I\u2019m not wrong cuz I can\u2019t be forced into a situation I don\u2019t want but my mom is making me overthink so am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t accept or decline on the spot on the off chance my husband may have wanted to go.

Said this is very kind of you, but we can't make it, or we're not ready, or just tell the truth, we have social anxiety and wouldn't be comfortable, but thank you for being so thoughtful.

So, YTA.", "NTA - this screams \"Fear Thy Neighbor\" kinda shit.", "NTA Introverts are INTROVERTS for a reason. I DO think you did yourself a disservice by not plainly stating to your neighbor \"hubby and I are extreme introverts and are excessively uncomfortable in crowds of more than two or three people\". Be honest about it, or even slightly dishonest and call it an ANXIETY or PHOBIA issue if you must, but you really need to place that  boundary up AS SOON AS YOU MEET neighbors, and new people. \n\nPeople are now becoming more emotionally intelligent about others and are learning that gatherings really FREAK some people out. But the onus IS ON YOU to set that boundary. If the neighbor doesn't like it, too bad, but you definitely MUST inform others of the extreme discomfort and that you choose to NOT create a situation, or participate in a gathering, where you'll feel very uncomfortable.  \n\n30 years ago, I had to just bear it, smile and go. I REALLY didn't want to do these things, but if I didn't there was either an opportunity or perk at work I would miss, that was DESERVED whether I went or not. Or my family would get all types of grief from their circles that they were \"punished\" for socially.  It's so much better now that people are learning about introverts and those who are ASD or neurodivergent. \n\nSome people just CANNOT handle it, and that's OKAY, but still, you are responsible for informing others. They don't like it or approve, they don't need to!!!  As it's not THEIR discomfort you are protecting, but YOUR OWN.", "NTA, you didn't know, and they never asked you if you were okay with it.\n\n\nAlso you and your husband are asocial, not antisocial", "NTA. Others have said that the neighbor should have been clear that the bbq was intended to welcome you to the neighborhood when extending the invite.\n\nI am going to go a bit further than that. They should have aporoached you, explained what they wanted to and asked if you would be interested **before** even starting to plan it. And, if you had accepted (which it eould have been ok to decline), they should have asked some questions to get to know you to be able to plan accordingly.\n\nTheir ambush method of party planning is both rude and stupid when they don't even know you, and your introversion is just one way this could have gone afoul.\n\nImagine the following scenarios where you aren't an introvert and had gone but instead...\n\nYou or your partner have Celiac and the food practically all contained gluten...\n\nYou and your partner are newly recovering alcoholics  (aren't far enough in your recovery to be around people drinking safely) and they served a lot of alcohol...\n\nYou are strict vegans and most of the food contained meat, dairy, eggs, etc...\n\nAll of these are ways where by their lack of prior communucation and getting to know a little about you they could have created a \"Welcome\" bbq that was most unwelcoming to you.\n\nAdmittedly, with that last scenario, just hearing \"bbq\" when invited the way you were, you'd have likely said something, and possibly declined outright. But I suspect that even so, the neighbor would have still gotten huffy \"for doing all that planning, only to have them decline when we invited them\".\n\nWhich is likely what would have happened if you had declined when you were invited. The neighbor would have gotten upset that you were refusing to cooperate with plans that they made **on your behalf** without your knowledge and consent.\n\nIt gets problematic enough when its done be people that know you (family, friends) and how you'll react. But to have it done by complete strangers...\n\nSide-note: If the bbq was for you and your presence was really that important, I do not understand why they did not come by to check on you when you did not show up within the first 45 minutes to an hour. The neighbor's method of inviting you was very casual. Casual enough that some people might have thought \"Oh, maybe I didn't say the start time clearly enough. Let me go see if they're on their way over.\" They live just down the block. A quick walk and knock could have allowed you to find out what it was really about to come join for a little while.\n\nTheir lack of that sensible step, and their name calling when you next saw them, suggests that they may be someone who is in a habit of making plans on behalf of others and expecting them to go along with it, whether they like it or not.", "What's with the stupid red text??", "[removed]", "Hah.
