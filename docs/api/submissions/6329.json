She constantly talks in a high-pitched, loud baby voice and NEVER turns it off.

She was on her phone and didn't see me yet. I am so awkward so I decided to turn the other way and walk up the flight of stairs however they were closed so I decided to just hide behind one of the pillars in the courtyard until she passed. However, as she came toward me she received a call and started talking. She had a really deep and normal voice, nothing compared to what I'd usually heard. She was talking to her mom and she sounded really quiet and soft-spoken. She kept telling her mom she would be home soon and she was really sorry. I was so baffled.\n\n2 weeks later I was in class next to her again and she kept talking to her friends about how much she hated people in our class.  While I was in the bathroom I heard her come in. Her friends and her were saying how I was such a bore to be around and they wished they could sit together. They also said I always look pissed at them (probs because I was but also I have RBF) I was the first person back to class after them and they were hanging around my desk. Nancy's friend asked me if we could change seats and I agreed. When the teacher got back she pulled me over and yelled at me in front of the whole class. Apparently, the seat I had been sitting in before had a bunch of slurs and notes about people in our class written on the plastic backing. She said Nancy's friend had informed her and apparently Nancy had \"seen me do it\". I lost my cool and stormed over to her and yelled \"HEY\", she looked really shocked but I didn't stop. I don't remember what I said exactly but I basically told her to grow up, stop being fake and called her an attention seeker. I'd usually be calm in that situation but something came over me. She suddenly burst out crying and started whispering about how she was just trying to be everyone's friend. It turns out she comes from a pretty broken home, something apparently everyone knew except me. She doesn't do well with people yelling at her which is understandable but she created the situation that led to me yelling. A lot of my friends are mad at me and said I was too harsh. I know she lied about me and I'm still mad about that, but was my reaction too harsh for the situation?", "created_utc": 1672669107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101dnxr/aita_for_yelling_at_a_girl_who_lied_about_me_to/", "score": 212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because she came from a crappy home doesn't excuse her for messing with you. What?! should you just let them walk all over you?

This is why I don\u2019t understand people who think high school is the golden years of life or something. It sucks. It will end.

You let her alone until she told lies about you and got you in trouble. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about her home life. That\u2019s rough. But she\u2019s trying to boost her self-esteem at the cost of others. She thinks if she trips you, she gets taller. That\u2019s not the case, of course. \n\nThere are two ways to define yourself - by what you are, and what you are not. If you have nothing positive to define yourself as, you have to put others down. \u201cAt least I\u2019m not\u201d xyz. This often leads to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ablism, body issues, all sorts of things. It\u2019s people not knowing how to define themselves, so they do it by process of exclusion. None of which is okay. \n\nYou were incredibly gracious to leave her be until she dragged you into it. You are now being bullied for standing up to your bully, and they say you should excuse her for her home life. That way leads nowhere. Her actions still have consequences, and should not be excused.
