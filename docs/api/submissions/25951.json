I agreed, with the understanding that he would return it when he was finished. I left it available to him in the future, so long as he gave some notice as to when he would pick it up. \n\nA week goes by, two, and then three, when I spot Jack at the gas station with the trailer, and his mower. The following week, the mother (35f), we\u2019ll call her Jill, of two of his children, posted on social media images that included the trailer being used as a sun deck for at least 10 children, aged 2-13.\n\nThe week after that, he posted on social media an advertisement of his services for mowing lawns\u2026\nA week later I spotted Jack pulling the trailer, empty, on his way to work.\n\nCould I have confronted him about this?\nSure, but Jill is a close friend of my spouse (35f) and both Jack and Jill are well acquainted with my FiL and MiL. I didn\u2019t want to rock the boat (as they say).\n\nLast month, our mower broke down and I have not had the opportunity to get it running. My Spouse texted Jack on Monday to see if he could return the trailer so that we could take our mower to a shop to have it fixed.\nFast forward to yesterday (Wednesday), after Jack dropped the trailer off, a set of passive aggressive messages fell into my inbox.\n\nJack: \u201cI brought your trailer back\u2026\u2026\u201d\nMe: \u201cAh, thank you! I hope it was useful.\u201d\nJack: \u201cYa l am gonna lose some yards bc I was using that to mow like 7 yards\u201d\nJack: \u201cI was using it so long bc (FiL) told me he wishes he had gave it to me bc I needed it\u201d\nMe: -silence-\nJack: \u201cGood talk bro good talk\u201d\nJack: \u201cIt's kinda like your taking food out my kids mouth\u201d\n\nI literally don\u2019t know how to respond, and haven\u2019t.\n\nBut at no point in the last 3-1/2 months has Jack offered to purchase the trailer outright, lease it, rent-to-own, he hasn\u2019t even offered to mow our yard in exchange for using the trailer. He also hasn\u2019t messaged myself or my spouse at any time between the day he requested to borrow it and the day he dropped it off.\n\ntl;dr, AITA for asking Jack to return my trailer for my legitimate needs?\n\n(Preemptive update: Spouse has strongly admonished Jack via text, cutting him off entirely. We have both blocked him pretty much everywhere, and I\u2019m going to chain the trailer to a tree.)", "created_utc": 1693498381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166fetf/aita_for_requesting_that_a_borrowed_trailer_be/", "score": 230, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If that's what he wanted, he should have said so in the first place.", "NTA. If he needed the trailer permanently he should've been upfront about it and propose any kind of compensation for it, in case you were interested in selling it/giving it away. He played dumb and then tried the guilt trip. He's an asshole. \n\nI would verify with your FIL if he actually told Jack that about wishing he had given the trailer to him instead. Because if he did, your FIL is kind of an asshole too.", "NTA - it\u2019s your property. If he wants one he can buy one himself or as you mentioned make some sort of arrangement to compensate you for its use, buy, rent, RTO, mow your lawn, something, anything. Expecting you to give it to him is outrageous.", "NTA What an absolute jerk!!!  He felt he could just keep your trailer for months and months and use it like it was his.  Just WOW!!  Don't loan this person anything ever again.  He can buy his own equipment for his jobs.", "NTA, its your trailer, not your FIL, or Jack's.  \nBorrowing it for so long was not the plan, you showed patience in getting it back.   \nWith all the jobs he has been doing he should buy his own trailer and depreciate it on his business taxes. If he hasn't started a business and is doing this as side hustle, he should buy his own or offer to buy your trailer.", "NTA. Jack is no friend of yours, he is a moocher who you don't need in your life.", "NTA - Jack talked himself into believing it was OK to exploit your kindness for his gain. He's not true to his word.

He is entitled and delusional. \n\nHe scorched this relationship, not you.", "NTA.\n\nSome people ask to borrow something and promptly return it.\n\nBut some other people ask to \"borrow\" meaning, \"Give it to me to keep.\" And they believe you are supposed to understand that. It's a form of legalized stealing.\n\nYou and spouse are right to cut him off. Nothing good would come from this relationship.", "NTA.  It wasn't his trailer.  That he would base jobs on having a trailer that didn't belong to him is ridiculous.  He should have talked to you about it and offered to purchase it. It also doesn't matter that FIL made he comment he did because it didn't belong to him either.", "NTA. He asked to borrow it for a specific purpose and knew he was expected to return it. Jack is being an entitled asshole and has ridiculous expectations.", "NTA. Clearly.", "NTA\n\nNever lend him ANYTHING again.", "NTA.    You could let it sit under a tree and never use again  and you are still NTA.\n\nIt's your property", "I agree 100% with your update.

If your FiL really does wish that he'd gifted the trailer to Jack (because he's using it to earn a living) instead of your family (because you're using it for less essential reasons), then that would hold some weight for me personally.\n\nI mean, I guess in a legalese kinda way, \"no takesie backsies\" would apply here, and it wouldn't matter what your FiL thinks now. But in a moral sense, if your FiL, who gifted you this piece of equipment, really does wish he hadn't done so in order to gift it to Jack, I at least would feel a bit conflicted about it.\n\nOf course, it's perfectly possible that Jack is full of shit and your FiL said no such thing.\n\nIf it were me, I would speak to my FiL and see what he thinks about the situation.", "NTA and I would not lend it to him again!!!!!", "Nta nobody likes people like Jack", "NTA\n\nHe should have returned it immediately, but instead kept it until you insisted and then tried to guilt you about it.

It's your trailer.", "NTA. By ANY stretch of the imagination. The absolute gall. We need to bring that word back, just for entitled people like him.", " No good deed goes unpunished.

Period.", "Some disambiguation.\nIn March of this year, our only tow vehicle was destroyed/totaled.\nFiL may have been in the mindset that someone with a working tow vehicle would have been a more suitable recipient for the gift. It was likely an off-hand, sympathetic comment.

And when my friend or whoever is apologizing I am totally fine with it. I usually have no problems because I forgot that they had it until I needed the item \ud83d\ude06. Then we both laugh because I forgot they had the item and they forgot to return it to me.", "NTA.

Then ask him how much he's made already and when's he gonna be back to pick it up so that he can take care of those seven yards?\n\nThen, when he meets you for the pick-up, demand 30% of his revenue right away. He made money off you _and_ gave you shit for kindly asking your trailer back. No payment? No trailer and fuck him and his kids' food craving mouths. NTA."]}
