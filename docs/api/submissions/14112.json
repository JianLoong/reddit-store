I split from my partner when my youngest was just born and I would for the most part only go out when my children were on weekend access at there dads.

Since then I have had them overnight Fri and Sat every second weekend for her to work untill Jan of this year. The other weekend they go to their dads Fri and sat overnight. She has started a new job now where she no longer has too work evenings.

At the end of the day child care is not your responsibility. She needs to find a sitter if her work schedule changed. You have your own kids to cade for. And your own life.

I think your daughter is terribly selfish and entitled for trying to push you on this. You have already been extremely generous. You wanting to have a life yourself does not make you a bad mom, no matter how much she or anyone else tries to guilt you for it.", "NTA: you have your grandchildren plenty, and your daughter should be incredibly grateful for the help you provide, not hounding you for more. A parent willing to provide childcare for grandchildren is a privilege not a right (I say this as someone who has no family support at all).", "[deleted]", "NTA tell her she can follow your wishes or find new daycare. You're happy to help but on your terms.", "NTA\n\nThey're her kids, not yours. She needs to work out childcare between herself and the father of her children, supplementing with a babysitter if needed. If you are willing to help out on occasion, that is great, but it should be when you are willing, not an expectation.", "NTA - you raised your kids and she can raise hers.  It would be nice if you had them over now and then (maybe once a month), but to expect it consistently is unfair.", "NTA. You are already doing more than any grand parent would. It is time dor you to enjoy your time off without any kid to look after.", "NTA. And why if she isn't working overnights anymore does she want you to keep them more? So she can go out? She's out of her mind and ungrateful.", "NTA, absolutely NTA! You\u2019ve done a lot for your daughter with caring for her children as much as you have over the years. You have gone above and beyond what most grandparents do. I think she\u2019s being very rude and extremely ungrateful to dare to call you an asshole and complain to her sister that you should be watching them more. They are her children. She should be watching them more. She already has time on the weekends they are with their dad to go out. She could invite friends over to her home when she has her kids for the weekend or just deal with the fact that being an adult with kids means you don\u2019t get to go out every weekend. If she wants less time with her children, she should renegotiate her custody agreement with her ex.", "NTA. 52 year old mom here.  Our youngest just left for college.  After 28 years of active mom duty, I am absolutely exhausted.  As a working mother, I have had very few nights out or sleep in mornings over the last 28 years.  I love my children like crazy, but I am so darn excited to have some time to do whatever I want to do. \n\nYou have done more than your fair share.  You are understandably exhausted- mentally and physically.  Enjoy your life - you have earned it.  Your daughter will figure it out, just like you did.", "NTA. Those are her kids, her responsibility. You've done more than enough. As you said, your kids are at an age where they can stay home alone. This is your time to go out and have fun. You shouldn't have to put your social life on hold because your daughter wants you to raise her kids. If she really can't for whatever reason, keep her kids at home on \"her weekend\", that's a conversation she needs to have with their father. You have your own kids and your own life. With her new hours of not working night shifts, she should want to have her kids home with her. What is she doing that the responsibility falls on you?", "NTA, but are never willing?  Your decision might bite you in the ass later.\n\nPfft.  My mother was very clear that she was not interested in babysitting my kids or having them overnight.  \n\nI didn't really like the answer, but I accepted it.  I am the middle kid so, I am last in everything for my whole freaking life.\n\nEveryone else has lived or currently lives at her current address.

Just like we say to brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc who are expected to babysit at someone else's whim. Not your kids, not your responsibility. We had 4 kids.

I'm having them for a week in the summer so she can go to a hen do. I took them on holiday last year for a week to give her a break. I just feel that I should be able to choose when I have them to sleep over. Not feel pressured to have them. When I have them overnight one of my daughter's has to give up her bed for them as there is not the room. I also find it really exhausting mentally and physically with the extra mess and attention they require. I like to have time to plan for overnight stays so I have the house tidy. Enough shopping in. Activities for them to do otherwise they get bored. When it's my choice to have them I feel happier and more relaxed as I have a plan of action in place and I enjoy my time with them so much more", "Right?
