There are so many bridezilla stories on here that yours seems like a non issue. If you've only put this weight on over the last year, surely you might have had something smaller, or with strings?\n\nI can understand your insecurities but don't take them out on your friends. Especially as it seems like you unnessicarily involved the bridesmaids and made the whole thing awkward.\n\nThis is how you lose friends and alienate people. If your weight is making you feel that unhappy and insecure think about what habits you can change to make yourself feel better. (Just been in a situation where I put on a load of weight and have had to think very carefully about how I ate and exercised to change that)", "I would say E S H since you may have overreacted,  but what she did was worse because even though best friends can sometimes tease and mock each other, something you're hyper sensitive about should be off limits. Snapping like you did is understandable after the frustration you have been feeling about being heavier than the other women in the wedding party.\n\nSo I would go with you're NTA.", "Bit of an overreaction tbh. Would you have felt any better about it if she pulled you aside and said the same thing in a different tone? \n\nMaybe she felt just as awkward as you do now and wasn't sure of the correct way to approach it. \n\nAs an aside and admittedly probably not helpful but I sometimes momentarily forget Americans call not underwear \"pants\" and got extremely confused by the title.\n\nGoing with NAH because I see both sides here. None of this sounds malicious."]}
