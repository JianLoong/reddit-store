You were willing to let him play, you just weren\u2019t willing to let him play on someone else\u2019s account.  It\u2019s a bit like letting your kid have a few special toys they don\u2019t have to let company play with because they\u2019re cared for carefully by the child and other kids might play rough with them and damage them.  I think most of the little girls I knew growing up had something like a \u201cspecial edition\u201d Barbie or expensive Disney doll that was special like that and only shared with very trusted friends, who they chose.  Your sister should have either told him to make do with the basic game or bought him the skins herself.  Demanding you let him play your daughter\u2019s account or pay for the skins was entitled and wrong.", "Of course NTA.  I don't ever feed entitled people. Your SIL is an AH and your nephew is a brat.", "NTA. What your daughter has isn't anyone else's business and it doesn't give anyone else a right to use her things.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to buy things for your nephew. If your SIL wanted her son to have something, she is the one that should be paying for it. \n\nAt 6 he is old enough to know he can't have everything he wants and his parents need to control his tantrums instead of enabling them!", "NTA in my opinion. I get that he is your nephew but your SIL can buy him one! Sometimes kids need to be taught that they can\u2019t always get what they want! They were your daughter\u2019s therefore they do not belong to him! SIL is teaching him that he can get whatever he wants even if it\u2019s someone else\u2019s!! Entitled!!", "NTA. Quite the ILs you have, demanding you buy your nephew something after you hosted them for a meal.", "NTA. I taught my children early on \u201cthat\u2019s not yours\u201d when they wanted other kids stuff. I never put it on the other child or parent.", "NTA. It's concerning that you SIL hasn't taught her son what \"no\" means and everyone threw a tantrum over it. They're not entitled to your property or your daughter's account.", "NTA - not your kid, not your problem", "NTA\n\nYour SIL can buy her kid a battle pass himself.", "NTA. I get it kids LOVE Fortnite but common decency still applies here! Their parents should have explained to the kid that he\u2019s a guest in the house and that\u2019s that. BUT I would also add this - being a generous host maybe could have let the kid try a round or two with the skin not the biggest deal in the world but still it\u2019s your house and your daughters acct. sooo..", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur wife is an AH. Maybe let the nephew play with her cosmetics instead.", "Nta like you said if he desperately wants the skins SIL can buy them herself. Idk why they act so entitled to your and your daughters stuff.", "I agree. Stupid hill for them to die on. NTA", "You don\u2019t need to spend often at all if you outplay it, I know what you are referring to.

Make it make sense.\n\nYour ILs are right about it being a stupid hill to die on.

You are not obligated to buy battle passes, skins, etc for him and it was important to protect your daughter's progress and stats since this is her home.", "NTA as a gamer I would be annoyed if someone played on my account - so well done for protecting your kid.  As for the skins, it\u2019s your money and your kid - how you spend it and what she buys is no one else\u2019s business.  \n\nA new user could be set up on the ps5 and others can play the same game without messing with your daughters stuff - it would be the basic game though not any extras\u2026\u2026..if that wasn\u2019t good enough then too bad for them.", "This is a stupid hill to die on...\n\nWTF is wrong with your In Laws?\n\nNTA", "NTA.

I'm not hugely bothered by age ratings, but he's literally half the age. Hope he's not talking to people on there", "NTA\n\nTelling your SIL that she could pay for your nephew's battle pass was the correct thing to do.

Why are you supposed to make things fair between your daughter and your nephew?", "NTA, nephew an SIA need to not be entitled, your money belongs to you", "NTA.  Good on you for following through!", "Really stupid hill to die on... Won't play on PS5 without skins? What a walnut this kid/SIL is.\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA the battle pass is like $10 to get enough vbucks", "NTA. It\u2019s the entitlement for me.", "NTA - your entitled in-laws need to grow the f up .  You took the logical solution.  They need to teach your nephew the word no means no.  Your SIL has some real entitlement issues and also needs to learn what no means", "NTA and this is from someone who only plays so my daughter can laugh at me as I get killed left and right. I completely suck at games and have no interest in the whatsoever. However, my late husband and my daughter that was their fun time. He worked away and the two would catch up a lot in the games. It was how they bonded and all she has all their old play saved on her older systems. He died on her 15th birthday and she asked me on her 16th if I would play with her. When someone would say to me before that it was a waste of time and brain cells, I would reply, sure I agree but it was how those two connected and I would  never disparage that. So yes to me it is a waste of brain cells, but to my daughter it is an irreplaceable memory of the joy she felt bonding with her dad while he was thousands of miles away. So to the ones saying it is a horrible hill to die on they can kindly fuck off. This is something your child feels confident in and you stood up for that that is going to become one of those irreplaceable moments for your daughter because we are not guaranteed time at all. Plus your nephew and SIL are entitled as hell and I never reward that lol.", "\u201cBuy my son a Battle Pass. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk. Give me ten dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. You misunderstand.

Lol I\u2019m a grown man so I think children should be told NO amd THATS NOT YOURS.. not adults lol", "Growing up there were a few relatives that were notorious among my siblings for messing up games. I don't even think they did it on purpose to be mean. They just seemed clueless about general etiquette in very specific areas. \n\nAny time we knew they were visiting, we'd end up hiding half our games so our saves wouldn't get deleted.", "NTA But innocent question, do people really let little kids play Fortnite? I thought it was more a young teen game.", "well done. people might not understand the importance of this stuff because they dont do it. you were right to protect your daughter's account kids tend to get into stuff and mess it up. his mom was just being a mom everything is fine", "NTA, make it a policy that no one else plays with you game console. Put it away or lock it up. You are under no obligation to purchase anything for your SIL so her child can play your PS5. Your wife and in-laws are wrong.", "NTA - your stuff, your rules. SIL has to learn that her kid can't go through life demanding other people's stuff. ILs need to tell her to stop demanding what doesn't belong to her. If they won't back off, tell them they can stay out.", "NTA. SIL is raising an entitled brat. IL's don't understand gaming. I'd ignore them. You and daughter should talk to your wife so she can understand why there was a confrontation. United front and what not.", "NTA, ok since your wife thinks it's not that big a deal ask her if she'd be fine with a coworker arbitrarily using her info and screwing up whatever metrics her job uses \"because it's not a big deal\"  Your daughter spends just as much effort on playing competitively as people do on work and likely has a tougher time maintaining her stats then most jobs metrics to boot.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, if i invited people to my house and all they wanted to do was play my familys game console, then I'd be annoyed. Maybe you need more toys to play with? The tv shouldn't even be on, but idk, maybe that's just how I was raised.\n\nSecond of all, good on you for standing up for your daughter. So what, we have to throw away stats that your daughter (im sure) worked over time to achieve and is probably proud of so that this bratty 6 year old can have a special outfit in the game? Yeah, it's all a game. It's imaginary, so you could say the daughter shouldn't be that invested. At the same time, the same argument could be made for the 6 year old. It's a *character* in a *video game* that is *not his.* His mother should be telling him to respect other peoples property, and if hes still crying at that point then it should be treated as a tantrum. You and your daughter did nothing wrong, and anyone who thinks you did doesn't understand the whole stats thing. Some people just can't understand that it's similar to the pride you'd feel if you were in a sports team. They only see it as pixels on a screen. I think it would have been a breach of trust. Your daughter may have even felt betrayed by you if her work was destroyed to appease that little punk.", "NTA thank you for respecting your daughter's shit", "NTA but it sounds like you are having an argument with SIL who has no idea what Fortnite is or how it works. Tell her it\u2019s rated M.", "NTA.\n\nGood for you. Children today have become insufferable bullies with their tantrums.\n\nTo avoid further trouble--because SIL hasn't finished with you and the skins, believe me--don't have her over anymore.", "You aren\u2019t the a hole tbh because I myself have lost mad money and DLC from someone in my family giving my hard earned and very cherished items away to younger generations and not even asking my permission wich has ruined many many accomplishments and achievements and account stuff I\u2019ll never see again..I get it", "Agreed but hey we\u2019re not the parents so maybe a bit agressive lol", "Plenty of people play video games before 6 lol I remember playing super mario during the same time frame I would've been playing with little people"]}
