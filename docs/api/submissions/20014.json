You were willing to let him play, you just weren\u2019t willing to let him play on someone else\u2019s account.  It\u2019s a bit like letting your kid have a few special toys they don\u2019t have to let company play with because they\u2019re cared for carefully by the child and other kids might play rough with them and damage them.  I think most of the little girls I knew growing up had something like a \u201cspecial edition\u201d Barbie or expensive Disney doll that was special like that and only shared with very trusted friends, who they chose.  Your sister should have either told him to make do with the basic game or bought him the skins herself.  Demanding you let him play your daughter\u2019s account or pay for the skins was entitled and wrong.", "Of course NTA.  I don't ever feed entitled people. Your SIL is an AH and your nephew is a brat.", "NTA.

If your SIL wanted her son to have something, she is the one that should be paying for it. \n\nAt 6 he is old enough to know he can't have everything he wants and his parents need to control his tantrums instead of enabling them!", "NTA in my opinion. I get that he is your nephew but your SIL can buy him one! Sometimes kids need to be taught that they can\u2019t always get what they want! They were your daughter\u2019s therefore they do not belong to him! SIL is teaching him that he can get whatever he wants even if it\u2019s someone else\u2019s!! Entitled!!", "NTA. Quite the ILs you have, demanding you buy your nephew something after you hosted them for a meal.", "NTA. I taught my children early on \u201cthat\u2019s not yours\u201d when they wanted other kids stuff. I never put it on the other child or parent.", "NTA.

They're not entitled to your property or your daughter's account.", "NTA - not your kid, not your problem", "NTA\n\nYour SIL can buy her kid a battle pass himself.", "NTA. I get it kids LOVE Fortnite but common decency still applies here! Their parents should have explained to the kid that he\u2019s a guest in the house and that\u2019s that. BUT I would also add this - being a generous host maybe could have let the kid try a round or two with the skin not the biggest deal in the world but still it\u2019s your house and your daughters acct. sooo..", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur wife is an AH.

As for the skins, it\u2019s your money and your kid - how you spend it and what she buys is no one else\u2019s business.  \n\nA new user could be set up on the ps5 and others can play the same game without messing with your daughters stuff - it would be the basic game though not any extras\u2026\u2026..if that wasn\u2019t good enough then too bad for them.", "This is a stupid hill to die on...\n\nWTF is wrong with your In Laws?\n\nNTA", "NTA.

You took the logical solution.  They need to teach your nephew the word no means no.  Your SIL has some real entitlement issues and also needs to learn what no means", "NTA and this is from someone who only plays so my daughter can laugh at me as I get killed left and right. I completely suck at games and have no interest in the whatsoever. However, my late husband and my daughter that was their fun time. He worked away and the two would catch up a lot in the games. It was how they bonded and all she has all their old play saved on her older systems. He died on her 15th birthday and she asked me on her 16th if I would play with her. When someone would say to me before that it was a waste of time and brain cells, I would reply, sure I agree but it was how those two connected and I would  never disparage that. So yes to me it is a waste of brain cells, but to my daughter it is an irreplaceable memory of the joy she felt bonding with her dad while he was thousands of miles away. So to the ones saying it is a horrible hill to die on they can kindly fuck off. This is something your child feels confident in and you stood up for that that is going to become one of those irreplaceable moments for your daughter because we are not guaranteed time at all. Plus your nephew and SIL are entitled as hell and I never reward that lol.", "\u201cBuy my son a Battle Pass. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk.

I don't even think they did it on purpose to be mean. They just seemed clueless about general etiquette in very specific areas. \n\nAny time we knew they were visiting, we'd end up hiding half our games so our saves wouldn't get deleted.", "NTA But innocent question, do people really let little kids play Fortnite? I thought it was more a young teen game.", "well done. people might not understand the importance of this stuff because they dont do it. you were right to protect your daughter's account kids tend to get into stuff and mess it up. his mom was just being a mom everything is fine", "NTA, make it a policy that no one else plays with you game console. Put it away or lock it up. You are under no obligation to purchase anything for your SIL so her child can play your PS5. Your wife and in-laws are wrong.", "NTA - your stuff, your rules. SIL has to learn that her kid can't go through life demanding other people's stuff. ILs need to tell her to stop demanding what doesn't belong to her. If they won't back off, tell them they can stay out.", "NTA. SIL is raising an entitled brat. IL's don't understand gaming. I'd ignore them. You and daughter should talk to your wife so she can understand why there was a confrontation. United front and what not.", "NTA, ok since your wife thinks it's not that big a deal ask her if she'd be fine with a coworker arbitrarily using her info and screwing up whatever metrics her job uses \"because it's not a big deal\"  Your daughter spends just as much effort on playing competitively as people do on work and likely has a tougher time maintaining her stats then most jobs metrics to boot.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, if i invited people to my house and all they wanted to do was play my familys game console, then I'd be annoyed. Maybe you need more toys to play with? The tv shouldn't even be on, but idk, maybe that's just how I was raised.\n\nSecond of all, good on you for standing up for your daughter. So what, we have to throw away stats that your daughter (im sure) worked over time to achieve and is probably proud of so that this bratty 6 year old can have a special outfit in the game? Yeah, it's all a game. It's imaginary, so you could say the daughter shouldn't be that invested. At the same time, the same argument could be made for the 6 year old. It's a *character* in a *video game* that is *not his.* His mother should be telling him to respect other peoples property, and if hes still crying at that point then it should be treated as a tantrum. You and your daughter did nothing wrong, and anyone who thinks you did doesn't understand the whole stats thing. Some people just can't understand that it's similar to the pride you'd feel if you were in a sports team. They only see it as pixels on a screen. I think it would have been a breach of trust. Your daughter may have even felt betrayed by you if her work was destroyed to appease that little punk.", "NTA thank you for respecting your daughter's shit", "NTA but it sounds like you are having an argument with SIL who has no idea what Fortnite is or how it works. Tell her it\u2019s rated M.", "NTA.\n\nGood for you. Children today have become insufferable bullies with their tantrums.\n\nTo avoid further trouble--because SIL hasn't finished with you and the skins, believe me--don't have her over anymore.", "You aren\u2019t the a hole tbh because I myself have lost mad money and DLC from someone in my family giving my hard earned and very cherished items away to younger generations and not even asking my permission wich has ruined many many accomplishments and achievements and account stuff I\u2019ll never see again..I get it", "Agreed but hey we\u2019re not the parents so maybe a bit agressive lol", "Plenty of people play video games before 6 lol I remember playing super mario during the same time frame I would've been playing with little people", "My cousins kid once used my iPad and wasted all my power ups for a game on levels o had already cleared. NTA.", "OMG,  I'm a grown adult that plays Fortnite when I want to kill shit. I'm not a fan of military games so I play Fortnite cause it's more toony.\n\nLet me explain how the \"Battle pass\" works.\n\nOnce you purchase the battle pass, it unlocks the battle pass page.  You get 2 free items out of 10 per page, to get the other 8, you unlock it by buying the battle pass.\n\nThe battle pack section contains 10 pages.  Each page is unlocked 1 at a time.  You unlock it by earning points in game.  Each page will get you 1 or 2 skins.  To get all 10-15 skins (I don't remember exact amount) you must get to level 100.  \n\nTo get to level 100, and unlock the extra 5 pages (plus 5-10 more skin) you have to get to I believe level 200 (maybe 150).  Once you get all pages unlocked and level all the way up and get all the points, you actually earn enough VBucks (as battle pass rewards) to buy the battle pass again next season with some left over.\n\nI played for almost 8 hours off and on last night, and I only got to level 25-30.  To get all 100 levels with all the skins it'll take like a week of playing almost 8 hours a day.  Maybe less with kids having a higher stamina than I do.\n\nThis means, even if you did buy the battle pass, he still would be stuck with the main 2 skins until he's played for hours and there is no way he's going to get the skins she has because they normally don't put out the same skins twice and if they do it's rare.\n\nThe only way to get him a lot of skins right away for him to play with is to buy the skins directly at like $10-20 PER SKIN.\n\nNTA - when at someone elses house, you play with what you are given, you don't make demands.", "Six year olds have no business playing Fortnite. This is especially true using serious gamer's account. And furthermore, they are cheap assholes for expecting you to pay. And the other in-laws are jerks too.

No is a complete sentence.", "Man, I would make a point that NONE of your in-laws are allowed back into your home until they understand that good \u2018ol sentiment of \u201cmy house, my rules\u201d\u2026 although my Gen X ass adjusted it to \u201cour family\u2019s house, our rules\u201d. \n\nI mean, take something your FIL enjoys\u2026 Cars? Chess? Piano? Sunday book full of stories? Give your nephew a box of colorful Sharpie markers and tell him to go nuts at their house! \u201cThe world is your canvas!!!\u201d \n\nTheir tone will change real fuckin\u2019 quick! \n\nNTA and stand your ground with prejudice!", "NTA.  Well you can see how you and your daughter rate compared to your SIL and nephew in your in laws eyes.

And I'd ask your wife why placating her nephew is more important to her than supporting her own daughter.", "NTA and you would have damaged your relationship with your daughter if you had let him mess up her stats/account. Your SIL can pay for her own child if she thinks he needs the skins so bad", "NTA.  Your SiL is acting in a very sexist manner. You offered a very good option of her buying a battle pass, but she was too cheap to go that route.", "NTA, he is six years old and should understand the word no and understand that the world does not revolve around him.  The issue is his AH mother.  He is her child, let her or the other IL pay for it. Your daughter earned a status in the game and it not to be shared.", "Nta, the kid is ignorant, but SIL is TA", "NTA\n\nYour nephew and his family need to learn the word no.

If it isn't yours, you don't get to just take it.", "[deleted]", "Hill to die on, putting boundaries to a 6 year old? Thats just silly. Anyways, cant you play unranked in fortnite, using the same skins? Not that it matters much, no means no.", "The child is 6 years old, he can go play with legos. He does not need to be playing fortnight. OP is right, no one should be playing video games anyways, it's a family get together on a sort of technically holiday. And OPs wife is clearly very unsupportive of the daughter, cause playing even semi competitively means the game is important and she must mention it a lot, and what certain things mean, hence OP knowing stats are important, how she got the skins. OP, can you lock up the PS whenever you and your daughter aren't home? Just a key for you and her? I don't trust your wife not to let the little grenlin play on it if SiL is ever over again, or any one else you might know for that matter with kids.", "Yes! I know a lot of people don't understand video games and stats, which does not make it less important. To a kid who plays competitively, this is her \"job.\" I'm sure she takes it very seriously. If your wife spends money on high-end cosmetics, clothes, trinkets... whatever is important to her, would she be fine with a 6 year old playing with it?", "It's the exact hill I would have died on if I were him.
