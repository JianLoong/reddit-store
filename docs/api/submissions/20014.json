I think most of the little girls I knew growing up had something like a \u201cspecial edition\u201d Barbie or expensive Disney doll that was special like that and only shared with very trusted friends, who they chose.  Your sister should have either told him to make do with the basic game or bought him the skins herself.  Demanding you let him play your daughter\u2019s account or pay for the skins was entitled and wrong.", "Of course NTA.  I don't ever feed entitled people.

I get that he is your nephew but your SIL can buy him one! Sometimes kids need to be taught that they can\u2019t always get what they want!

I completely suck at games and have no interest in the whatsoever. However, my late husband and my daughter that was their fun time. He worked away and the two would catch up a lot in the games. It was how they bonded and all she has all their old play saved on her older systems. He died on her 15th birthday and she asked me on her 16th if I would play with her. When someone would say to me before that it was a waste of time and brain cells, I would reply, sure I agree but it was how those two connected and I would  never disparage that. So yes to me it is a waste of brain cells, but to my daughter it is an irreplaceable memory of the joy she felt bonding with her dad while he was thousands of miles away. So to the ones saying it is a horrible hill to die on they can kindly fuck off. This is something your child feels confident in and you stood up for that that is going to become one of those irreplaceable moments for your daughter because we are not guaranteed time at all.

They just seemed clueless about general etiquette in very specific areas. \n\nAny time we knew they were visiting, we'd end up hiding half our games so our saves wouldn't get deleted.", "NTA But innocent question, do people really let little kids play Fortnite? I thought it was more a young teen game.", "well done. people might not understand the importance of this stuff because they dont do it. you were right to protect your daughter's account kids tend to get into stuff and mess it up. his mom was just being a mom everything is fine", "NTA, make it a policy that no one else plays with you game console. Put it away or lock it up. You are under no obligation to purchase anything for your SIL so her child can play your PS5. Your wife and in-laws are wrong.", "NTA - your stuff, your rules. SIL has to learn that her kid can't go through life demanding other people's stuff. ILs need to tell her to stop demanding what doesn't belong to her. If they won't back off, tell them they can stay out.", "NTA. SIL is raising an entitled brat. IL's don't understand gaming. I'd ignore them. You and daughter should talk to your wife so she can understand why there was a confrontation. United front and what not.", "NTA, ok since your wife thinks it's not that big a deal ask her if she'd be fine with a coworker arbitrarily using her info and screwing up whatever metrics her job uses \"because it's not a big deal\"  Your daughter spends just as much effort on playing competitively as people do on work and likely has a tougher time maintaining her stats then most jobs metrics to boot.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, if i invited people to my house and all they wanted to do was play my familys game console, then I'd be annoyed. Maybe you need more toys to play with? The tv shouldn't even be on, but idk, maybe that's just how I was raised.\n\nSecond of all, good on you for standing up for your daughter. So what, we have to throw away stats that your daughter (im sure) worked over time to achieve and is probably proud of so that this bratty 6 year old can have a special outfit in the game? Yeah, it's all a game. It's imaginary, so you could say the daughter shouldn't be that invested. At the same time, the same argument could be made for the 6 year old. It's a *character* in a *video game* that is *not his.* His mother should be telling him to respect other peoples property, and if hes still crying at that point then it should be treated as a tantrum. You and your daughter did nothing wrong, and anyone who thinks you did doesn't understand the whole stats thing. Some people just can't understand that it's similar to the pride you'd feel if you were in a sports team. They only see it as pixels on a screen. I think it would have been a breach of trust. Your daughter may have even felt betrayed by you if her work was destroyed to appease that little punk.", "NTA thank you for respecting your daughter's shit", "NTA but it sounds like you are having an argument with SIL who has no idea what Fortnite is or how it works.

NTA.", "OMG,  I'm a grown adult that plays Fortnite when I want to kill shit. I'm not a fan of military games so I play Fortnite cause it's more toony.\n\nLet me explain how the \"Battle pass\" works.\n\nOnce you purchase the battle pass, it unlocks the battle pass page.  You get 2 free items out of 10 per page, to get the other 8, you unlock it by buying the battle pass.\n\nThe battle pack section contains 10 pages.  Each page is unlocked 1 at a time.  You unlock it by earning points in game.  Each page will get you 1 or 2 skins.  To get all 10-15 skins (I don't remember exact amount) you must get to level 100.  \n\nTo get to level 100, and unlock the extra 5 pages (plus 5-10 more skin) you have to get to I believe level 200 (maybe 150).  Once you get all pages unlocked and level all the way up and get all the points, you actually earn enough VBucks (as battle pass rewards) to buy the battle pass again next season with some left over.\n\nI played for almost 8 hours off and on last night, and I only got to level 25-30.  To get all 100 levels with all the skins it'll take like a week of playing almost 8 hours a day.  Maybe less with kids having a higher stamina than I do.\n\nThis means, even if you did buy the battle pass, he still would be stuck with the main 2 skins until he's played for hours and there is no way he's going to get the skins she has because they normally don't put out the same skins twice and if they do it's rare.\n\nThe only way to get him a lot of skins right away for him to play with is to buy the skins directly at like $10-20 PER SKIN.\n\nNTA - when at someone elses house, you play with what you are given, you don't make demands.", "Six year olds have no business playing Fortnite. This is especially true using serious gamer's account. And furthermore, they are cheap assholes for expecting you to pay. And the other in-laws are jerks too.

Chess? Piano? Sunday book full of stories?

He does not need to be playing fortnight. OP is right, no one should be playing video games anyways, it's a family get together on a sort of technically holiday. And OPs wife is clearly very unsupportive of the daughter, cause playing even semi competitively means the game is important and she must mention it a lot, and what certain things mean, hence OP knowing stats are important, how she got the skins. OP, can you lock up the PS whenever you and your daughter aren't home? Just a key for you and her? I don't trust your wife not to let the little grenlin play on it if SiL is ever over again, or any one else you might know for that matter with kids.", "Yes! I know a lot of people don't understand video games and stats, which does not make it less important. To a kid who plays competitively, this is her \"job.\" I'm sure she takes it very seriously. If your wife spends money on high-end cosmetics, clothes, trinkets... whatever is important to her, would she be fine with a 6 year old playing with it?", "It's the exact hill I would have died on if I were him.

She's put work in for those stats.", "Why is a 6yo playing fortnite anyways? He shouldn't know what battle pass and skins are smh.\n\nNTA you would have let him play.

My 10yo keeps asking why she can't be on TikTok even with the new profile restrictions for kids. She swears she won't \"do anything bad\" or watch inappropriate things. And I believe her.

Grand Theft Auto. \n\nIt\u2019s a highly vulgar, violent, and incredibly popular video game franchise.", "Grand Theft Auto- it's a large video game franchise centered around playing as a criminal in a fictional world. It's pretty much parody, but jts very much unsuitable for kids. I played it first around 15 or so and I would say that's probably a sensible age, although it's legally rated for over 18s. Has swearing, violence, drugs, sexual content and that's just off the top of my head. \n\nIn my opinion up there for one of the best game series ever made."]}
