Nephew needs to learn the importance of the word \"no\" followed by \"it's not yours so you need permission.\" Good on you for standing up for your daughter. \n\nThis is the 21st century of \"Fine, I'll just turn the car around.\"", "NTA.  You were willing to let him play, you just weren\u2019t willing to let him play on someone else\u2019s account.  It\u2019s a bit like letting your kid have a few special toys they don\u2019t have to let company play with because they\u2019re cared for carefully by the child and other kids might play rough with them and damage them.  I think most of the little girls I knew growing up had something like a \u201cspecial edition\u201d Barbie or expensive Disney doll that was special like that and only shared with very trusted friends, who they chose.  Your sister should have either told him to make do with the basic game or bought him the skins herself.  Demanding you let him play your daughter\u2019s account or pay for the skins was entitled and wrong.", "Of course NTA.  I don't ever feed entitled people. Your SIL is an AH and your nephew is a brat.", "NTA. What your daughter has isn't anyone else's business and it doesn't give anyone else a right to use her things.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to buy things for your nephew. If your SIL wanted her son to have something, she is the one that should be paying for it. \n\nAt 6 he is old enough to know he can't have everything he wants and his parents need to control his tantrums instead of enabling them!", "NTA in my opinion. I get that he is your nephew but your SIL can buy him one! Sometimes kids need to be taught that they can\u2019t always get what they want! They were your daughter\u2019s therefore they do not belong to him! SIL is teaching him that he can get whatever he wants even if it\u2019s someone else\u2019s!! Entitled!!", "NTA. Quite the ILs you have, demanding you buy your nephew something after you hosted them for a meal.", "NTA. I taught my children early on \u201cthat\u2019s not yours\u201d when they wanted other kids stuff. I never put it on the other child or parent.", "NTA. It's concerning that you SIL hasn't taught her son what \"no\" means and everyone threw a tantrum over it. They're not entitled to your property or your daughter's account.", "NTA - not your kid, not your problem", "NTA\n\nYour SIL can buy her kid a battle pass himself.", "NTA. I get it kids LOVE Fortnite but common decency still applies here! Their parents should have explained to the kid that he\u2019s a guest in the house and that\u2019s that. BUT I would also add this - being a generous host maybe could have let the kid try a round or two with the skin not the biggest deal in the world but still it\u2019s your house and your daughters acct. sooo..", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur wife is an AH. Maybe let the nephew play with her cosmetics instead.", "Nta like you said if he desperately wants the skins SIL can buy them herself. Idk why they act so entitled to your and your daughters stuff.", "I agree. Stupid hill for them to die on. NTA", "You don\u2019t need to spend often at all if you outplay it, I know what you are referring to. No reason to spend for him throwing a hissy fit.\n\nNephew was being spoiled, and his mother was enabling it. Good for you for not also enabling it!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSo SIL thinks it\u2019s a waste of money. But also that her son is entitled to it. At your expense. Make it make sense.\n\nYour ILs are right about it being a stupid hill to die on. SIL\u2019s the one who died on it, though.", "NTA \n\nYour SIL can indulge her own child as much as she wants, but your nephew can either play by your rules in your house or not at all. You are not obligated to buy battle passes, skins, etc for him and it was important to protect your daughter's progress and stats since this is her home.", "NTA as a gamer I would be annoyed if someone played on my account - so well done for protecting your kid.  As for the skins, it\u2019s your money and your kid - how you spend it and what she buys is no one else\u2019s business.  \n\nA new user could be set up on the ps5 and others can play the same game without messing with your daughters stuff - it would be the basic game though not any extras\u2026\u2026..if that wasn\u2019t good enough then too bad for them.", "This is a stupid hill to die on...\n\nWTF is wrong with your In Laws?\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your SIL needs to learn not to encourage jealousy in her kid.", "NTA, high 5 for respecting your daughter's thing.\n\n6 is very young for fortnight too. I'm not hugely bothered by age ratings, but he's literally half the age. Hope he's not talking to people on there", "NTA\n\nTelling your SIL that she could pay for your nephew's battle pass was the correct thing to do. Honestly, your SIL sounds like a choosing beggar, and I feel very sorry for your brother for marrying her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
