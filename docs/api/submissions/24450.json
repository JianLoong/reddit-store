Maybe someone will give you a better idea, but it's really not on you.", "Based on the other info you added in another comment, NTA. You expressed your boundaries to her. She kept stepping over them.

No, and especially not if the other person won't respect reasonable boundaries (which they probably don't understand anyway).\n\nI'm sorry for her.  But you're NTA.", "She sounds so exhausting. NTA.

I had to do something similar in a similar situation, and I felt like a heel for doing it, but I was having to justify why I had to get off the phone so that I could eat, why I couldn't dedicate a whole day every week to her ( i worked full time, had hobbies and other friends to see, plus needed downtime), and all this was after just a few months of knowing her. It was suffocating. \n\nShe was lonely, and had been ditched before for the same behaviour (though she thought it was because she was disabled), so she was hyper aware of it. But she wasn't open to just having a casual friendship, it was all consuming, and she couldn't do a halfway thing. I couldn't cope with the demands and bailed.\n\nIt's really unfortunate, but NTA. It might be worth having a word with her guardian and explaining what you've told us. They might be able to find a way to help her deal.", "NTA. I was friends with a disabled person where I live.

She\u2019s lonely and sad but what you describe is absolutely unsustainable for you. You don\u2019t really have the power to make it better for her.
