There was always kind of an inherent separation b/w us because of the age gap, but we loved each other and still do nonetheless. \n\nAshley moved across the country about 7-8 years ago, and besides the occasional text, we never really talked since. We just kind of drifted apart and we were both okay with it. Just to describe her a bit, she\u2019s gay (never ever been a problem), is a huge stoner (I smoke occasionally too), but to the point where all she wears is rainbow and weed outfits for every occasion, formal or not, she makes being a stoner her entire personality.  \n\nAbout a year ago, I got engaged, and soon after I asked Ashley to be one of my bridesmaids. She said yes, and that was that. Looking back I felt an obligation to have her in our wedding because she\u2019s family. Time went on, and again that same obligation feeling led me to invite her and her girlfriend (33F) (we\u2019ll call her Dani) to our combined bachelor/ette party. \n\nThe trip came and Ashley and Dani were making us uncomfortable. They\u2019re hardcore potheads (their words not mine) and asked if they could smoke in the car ride there, barely asked me anything about my life while I asked a bunch about theirs (this was also my first time meeting Dani). They didn\u2019t really interact with anyone, and I get that to an extent, they are in their 30s and the rest of us aren\u2019t, but it made folks uncomfortable.\n\nSo after reflecting on how the trip went and how our only conversation the whole trip was about childhood memories, or their lives across the country, I realized we are two completely different people and we had drifted farther apart than I thought, which is sad but true. Ashley also chose to stay with her mom and stepdad before the trip who she told me are extremely homophobic and assholes, rather than staying with us\u2026.. That alone put a bad taste in my mouth too. All that being said, I felt uncomfortable having someone stand up in my wedding that doesn\u2019t know me or what\u2019s important to me anymore. It felt like it would just be for show at this point, so I explained this to her after painful consideration and told her I\u2019d rather her be a guest (9 months before the wedding at that point, and now we\u2019re about 6 months out). \n\nNow after she first told me she understood, she\u2019s blowing up my phone with essays about how it\u2019s not fair to expect her to make time for our family when she\u2019s home and that she\u2019s broke and can\u2019t come home very often (Ashley and Dani are constantly posting about new tattoos they\u2019re getting and things they\u2019re buying)\u2026.. she\u2019s telling me there must be a deeper reason I\u2019m not telling her like I don\u2019t like that she\u2019s gay or a stoner and went as far as to tell me \u201cher therapist thinks my reasons are bogus\u201d\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for removing my sister from my bridal party?", "created_utc": 1702769858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18k3ru2/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_want_her_in_my/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's totally valid for you to want her as a guest but not in the bridal party. \n\nWhat does coming home often or making time for family have to do with it? \n\nYou don't need a \"deep\" reason beyond realizing at the bachelor/ette party that you've drifted father apart than you previously realized and you changed your mind about having her be a bridesmaid. \n\nJust make sure you reimburse her for anything she spent money on that she won't get to use because of this change. And make sure she knows that you still want her at your wedding because you love her and want her to share this milestone with you.", "NTA.\n\nYou've realized that you guys really aren't close, your worried about what she would say at the wedding, and you let her now MONTHS in advance.\n\nDon't expect her to come to the wedding.  It just is what it is.  Your reason is what it is.  She/therapist may want to try and assign it some other reason, but you yourself understand your reasoning,sounds like you realized you guys don't really know eachother.", "NTA it's your wedding & your reasons sound reasonable and fair amount of heads up as well. I think she's also just making up/twisting the therapist thing.", "So she can afford tattoos, drugs and therapy but not anything that is family related?", "NAH. Well, she's right in that you don't like that she's such a stoner. \n\nSounds like you wanted more attention on you, which kind of sounds petty but it IS your wedding party. You also get to make the decisions.", "YTA.  You didn't really have a specific reason other than you two aren't really close, which you knew before you asked her.  It would have been fine to have never asked her, but once you did, you should have had a really good reason for doing it and you didn't.  Of course she's going to assume it's something about her, since you didn't have a fight and she didn't really do anything wrong.  \n\nNow you've made the whole thing into this big stink when you could have just sucked it up and let her be in your bridal party.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And you hadn\u2019t had much contact with her for years. \n\nShe sounds like she went LC with family for years.

This is ultimately your day and you should have the people you want in your bridal party. You gave her plenty of notice about your decision and the fact she initially accepted it only to then do a complete 180 makes me think someone else is involved in that.", "NTA, it was considerate of you to try and include her, but ultimately it's your wedding and you should do what will make you happy and have the day you imagine. I have a half sister myself and we have about the same age gap, though I'm the 33 year old and she's 24. I understand the want to include her because she's your sister, but I also know the feeling of being so different from one another and not really knowing what to do. You shouldn't be obligated to do anything because she's family. If anything, she should be happy to be there in whatever capacity because she cares about you and wants to be there. Don't let her project her feelings onto you.", "You\u2019re not kids anymore.

Nothing stopping her from keeping in touch and up to date that way whilst unable to make the trip in person. It\u2019s just an excuse because she doesn\u2019t want to make the effort, and even this sudden change of heart and all is just her way to try and shift any responsibility to you because she doesn\u2019t want to accept anything could be her fault."]}
