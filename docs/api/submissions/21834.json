For those who didn\u2019t catch it, here\u2019s the basic story (feel free to comment any additional details or corrections, this is from memory):\n\nDad is at a fair with his 4yo kid in a long line for a ride. Meets family behind him in line who also have a small child, and they become friendly. Wants to go get a beer at a nearby booth, but doesn\u2019t want to give up spot in line. Asks family to watch kid while he goes. Family says no. Dad leaves kid anyway and comes back with beer making disparaging comments about \u201ccommon courtesy\u201d towards family. Claims it was okay because the kid was viewable to him the whole time.\n\nGeneral consensus was that he was the asshole for leaving the kid unattended and expecting strangers to be okay with watching him. People suggested that the far easier solution would have been to just ask the family to hold the spot in line.\n\nI see the similarities, but the crux of the issue is very different.", "Yeah, it is polite, but what makes OP the AH is that they are openly saying that the only reason they did not allow the people back in line is because they didn\u2019t ask permission from OP first. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t care that they had time out of the line, OP only cares that they weren\u2019t asked for permission first.", "\"oh god my period just happened and I might bleed through my pants, BRAYDEN WE GOTTA GO\" -an imaginary but also totally likely scenario", "Ha, as soon as I read this I thought \"Sounds like a Curb plotline.\"", "Sure but when they do come back it\u2019s still common decency to let them back.
