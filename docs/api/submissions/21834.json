I understand it might have been a bethroom trip but its their responsibilty to ask the people behind them to save their spot. Also i saw someone else say this and I 100% agree: \"Nobody is asking you to bring your kid to a place where the wait is 1 hour.\" Exactly this kid would prefer a quick 5 min mcdonalds trip over just waiting in the line.

A 10 year old can feel comfortable walking to the bathroom by themselves having a target and goal they are thinking about and moving.  If they are alone waiting in line the kid will become more anxious with more people around them and feeling like people are watching them or being put on the spot.  A stationary target that someone saw their parent walk off and left alone is also an easier target of manipulation than one that is walking to the bathroom and back and most people will assume someone is around.

Could have been 5 since they said 5-10 your cherry picking the long end, but it is quite common an occurrence for a bathroom break to take 5 min plus people waiting are horrible at judging time.   Fact is though this stuff happens all the time and the vast majority of the time people let them back in line which makes it the social normal thus they are an asshole.
