They should have figured out a way to make sure you'd be there.  Maybe actually talk to your parents because you are a minor to let them know they were planning this.  You can't be expected to attend something you knew nothing about.", "Oof. NTA. When you plan a surprise party, you're supposed to make pretend plans with the guest of honor to make sure they're available.

You had no idea to schedule or not make other plans\n\nFriends should have told you upfront", "Ah to be a teen.

You wanted to do something specific on your birthday and they didn't. You found someone else to do it with.

They canceled on you on your birthday, so you made other plans. You were completely justified in that hurting, and your dad is awesome to try to make it better by making plans with you. Kudos to dad.

Also, I'm glad your parents stepped up and took you to the city to have fun when you thought your friends had let you down.  That was cool of them -- my parents wouldn't have done that!", "lol NTA. I can't imagine throwing a surprise party for someone and then being upset that they didn't show up when I did nothing to ensure that they'd be there.\n\nIn your place I'd be kinda mad that they thought I'd be sad enough to just sit at home and do nothing on my birthday, and that was their entire plan to make sure I didn't make any other plans.", "It\u2019s your 16h!

Why not involve her parents.", "Right? My friends threw me a surprise party for my 16th. My best friend told my parents who took me out to dinner while they set up.", "Exactly! This is how my surprise 17th birthday outing happened because my bestie coordinated with my mother.", ":D I have no idea how aware the average 16 year old is of the meaning of the word \"surprise\" ;)"]}
