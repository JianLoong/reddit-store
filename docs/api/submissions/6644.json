Poor planning and they have zero right to be mad.", "NTA \n\nLet me get this straight. They have a party, but don\u2019t invite you.

They should have figured out a way to make sure you'd be there.  Maybe actually talk to your parents because you are a minor to let them know they were planning this.  You can't be expected to attend something you knew nothing about.", "Oof. NTA. When you plan a surprise party, you're supposed to make pretend plans with the guest of honor to make sure they're available.

You had no idea to schedule or not make other plans\n\nFriends should have told you upfront", "Ah to be a teen. God I remember how emotionally/socially stupid everyone was at that time, this is classic stuff.

You wanted to do something specific on your birthday and they didn't. You found someone else to do it with.

They canceled on you on your birthday, so you made other plans. You were completely justified in that hurting, and your dad is awesome to try to make it better by making plans with you. Kudos to dad.
