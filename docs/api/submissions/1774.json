We pay rent to them so I\u2019ll be cheaper than renting an apartment. My parents didn\u2019t have a problem with that and they are really supportive. They wanted us to earn so we can buy a place of our own. My boyfriend and I decided that we get our own house first before getting married, so that we\u2019ll be settled by then. We are still young and have more plans before getting married. \n\nIt\u2019s been months since my boyfriend\u2019s mom \u201cforcing\u201d us to get married. She\u2019ll say that \u201cit doesn\u2019t look good for people to be living together but not married\u201d. Every time she say that, i just roll my eyes and not even pay attention. For me, it\u2019s very offensive and inconsiderate of her because she just want it because \u201cIT DOESNT LOOK GOOD\u201d and \u201cEMBARRASSING \u201c. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re doing something wrong.\n\nLast thanksgiving, we invited their whole family to have dinner with us. What my boyfriend\u2019s mom said to my parents shocked me. She said \u201cso next year, they have to be married.\u201d My mom just laughed. My dad said \u201cas long as they are settled, I\u2019m okay with that. We all talked about that. If they have they own house, earned enough to support themselves, they can be married tomorrow if they want to.\u201d She turned to my mom when she said \u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem if they are living together. They aren\u2019t ready yet, and I don\u2019t want to talk about that just yet\u201d. Her answer made me so mad even to my boyfriend. She said to parents \u201cit\u2019s not up to you.\u201d I looked at my boyfriend and waiting for him to say anything because everyone on the table can sense the tension. \n\nA few weeks after, we were visited my boyfriend\u2019s siblings. Out of nowhere she said \u201ctell your dad we need to talk. You guys need to be married by next year. It doesn\u2019t look good living together and you are not married\u201d I couldn\u2019t help myself and said \u201cno. I don\u2019t want to be married to your son yet. We have plans. House before marriage. We talked about it and everything is okay. If it doesn\u2019t look good to you, then don\u2019t look. You don\u2019t get to decide about that, we do.\u201d i walked away and went to my boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s room. \n\nHis sister (17) asked \u201cwhy do you have to force them to be married and they both have full-time job, they are not doing anything wrong. They are not asking anyone for money to support them. Hell, you ask him (my bf) money for groceries even if we give you all our salaries. You ask him for more and he doesn\u2019t even live here anymore. And her response was just \u201cOther people know that they are living together and its really embarrassing.\u201d \n\nSo am I the A?", "created_utc": 1667851053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yoydgl/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriends_mom_that_i_dont/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yep. Of course she did. Seriously, this needs to be nipped in the bud now or it will be an endless battle like this forever. This is on your bf to nip it in the bud.

Look, you are making it worse by engaging. Don't engage on this subject with her. Your BF should be sorting it. You are both waaaay too ill-equipped to be married anyway and your potential future MIL doesn't respect you (I wonder what she'd say if you told her you couldn't get married because of her lack of respect?).

This isn\u2019t the 1800s lol most people live together before they get married because it\u2019s smart to know that side of them.

I would have definitely waited if I had lived with my husband longer", "Info: Why isn't your bf standing up to his own mom?", "NTA but house (if you mean buying one) before marriage is an absolute mistake.
