It wasn't about your birthday.", "NTA- \"They're all eating right now and I feel like this was really all for them to have a big meal and not about me at all.\"\n\nYou are correct.

First world problems though! I'm trying to remember that I shouldn't expect anything and I'm not owed anything by anyone. It still feels hurtful though.", "It's pretty sad when even your own mom doesn't want to hangout with you. That's how it felt. I kind of was using my bday to hangout with her and she ditched me. But still not eating the big seafood dinner still felt really spoiled despite the fact that I was feeling really hurt.", "Ya it would have been fun. I can just go on my own or with a friend but I wanted to hangout with my mom. My brother has serious mental health issues so I never get any time with her. Instead of spending it with me she does this dinner thing. And then she wasn't even available for my cake because she took my brother to the store. I had the cake on my own.", "I cant even give her an earful because getting mad at someone just makes me more upset. I had my cake on my own so I think that says right there what I should expect from them. I just wanted a few hours to hangout with my mom, it wasn't even about the dinner or craft store that much. I never get time with her.", "No one ate the cake with me I ate alone. My mom took my brother to the store, my other sibling wasn't interested and my dad was watching TV. Maybe she was mad at me for not eating the dinner. That's kind of why I was wondering if maybe I am being spoiled. It's hard to know in the moment when you're upset.", "You're right I'm not owed anything and thats why I wasn't sure if I was being bratty/drama queen. I think I'm done with birthdays, no ones interested so why even bother with it. No one even did the cake with me I just had a slice on my own and then they will take slices whenever probably.", "The real reason I was upset is I never get any time with my mom as my brother is mentally ill and he's the favourite. It wasn't so much even the craft store or dinner it was that she ditched hanging out with me. Then after this she went to the store with my brother and I had a slice of cake alone. My other sibling wasn't interested and my dad was watching TV.\n\nI mean maybe she thought I wouldn't want to do the cake after missing dinner but I just don't get how she has time to hangout with my brother and not me.", "You are definitely not being a spoiled brat. Since this happens a lot, I imagine they\u2019ve conditioned you to think that way.  My family did the same to me when I was growing up. My birthday was rarely ever acknowledged because of its proximity to a racist holiday in which everyone feels the need to eat turkey and watch football.  I literally just wanted one day where I mattered and was told every year that I didn\u2019t matter at all.  I\u2019m sorry that your family is doing the same to you. NTA", ">I'm trying to remember that I shouldn't expect anything and I'm not owed anything by anyone.\n\nWhat? No! That's a horrible lesson!\n\nSure, it's some kind of Reddit / AITA thing to say you never owe anyone anything, but that's wrong. We owe even a stranger on the street basic considerations like taking a step aside to avoid bumping into them, holding a door so it won't hit them in the face, etc.\n\nOur loved ones, we owe a hell of a lot more. We owe it to them to care about their feelings, to share the burden with them when they're down, and share the celebrations with them when they're happy. \n\nIf your family can't even be bothered to care about a simple request like \"no seafood\" and \"trip to the craft store\" on your fricking birthday, then they're the problem. Not you.", "Don\u2019t give up on bdays. Your fam just sucks. When you\u2019re on your own you can celebrate with friends however you want!", "That\u2019s so dumb of them bc it\u2019s a perfect twofer. They\u2019re already gathered for the holiday, just knock out a bday as well. My son\u2019s is right around then, so we do them together. I always make whatever cake my kid wants. One year it was something fancy PLUS a pumpkin pie. Still haven\u2019t worked off those calories lol. \n\nBut everyone knows it\u2019s T-day PLUS bday.", "Oh, they did both. I got whatever cake they bought for dessert even if I didn\u2019t like it.  I also was forced to eat turkey, which I hate. If they made something extra for me, I was accused of being a drama queen.  Most of the time, if I got presents they were late because they wanted to wait for Black Friday deals. \n\nAll I wanted was one day just like everyone else, but they just couldn\u2019t manage it.  It\u2019s why I never go \u201chome\u201d for Thanksgiving. I\u2019m going to be there in early November and my aunt suggested celebrating early. I vehemently protested that, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be overruled."]}
