Since this happens a lot, I imagine they\u2019ve conditioned you to think that way.  My family did the same to me when I was growing up. My birthday was rarely ever acknowledged because of its proximity to a racist holiday in which everyone feels the need to eat turkey and watch football.

That's a horrible lesson!\n\nSure, it's some kind of Reddit / AITA thing to say you never owe anyone anything, but that's wrong. We owe even a stranger on the street basic considerations like taking a step aside to avoid bumping into them, holding a door so it won't hit them in the face, etc.\n\nOur loved ones, we owe a hell of a lot more. We owe it to them to care about their feelings, to share the burden with them when they're down, and share the celebrations with them when they're happy. \n\nIf your family can't even be bothered to care about a simple request like \"no seafood\" and \"trip to the craft store\" on your fricking birthday, then they're the problem. Not you.", "Don\u2019t give up on bdays. Your fam just sucks. When you\u2019re on your own you can celebrate with friends however you want!", "That\u2019s so dumb of them bc it\u2019s a perfect twofer. They\u2019re already gathered for the holiday, just knock out a bday as well. My son\u2019s is right around then, so we do them together. I always make whatever cake my kid wants. One year it was something fancy PLUS a pumpkin pie. Still haven\u2019t worked off those calories lol. \n\nBut everyone knows it\u2019s T-day PLUS bday.", "Oh, they did both. I got whatever cake they bought for dessert even if I didn\u2019t like it.  I also was forced to eat turkey, which I hate. If they made something extra for me, I was accused of being a drama queen.  Most of the time, if I got presents they were late because they wanted to wait for Black Friday deals. \n\nAll I wanted was one day just like everyone else, but they just couldn\u2019t manage it.  It\u2019s why I never go \u201chome\u201d for Thanksgiving. I\u2019m going to be there in early November and my aunt suggested celebrating early.

What would this have meant for the rest of the family? Are the other kids old enough to make dinner themselves and/or is there another parent in the home that could\u2019ve cared for them?  If this happened yesterday, is it possible that a trip to the craft store wasn\u2019t feasible midweek but you can go another time?  Leaning toward NTA because your mom shouldn\u2019t have asked whether you wanted a seafood dinner if she was going to make it regardless of your answer. However, your birthday doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to whatever you want when you want it.
