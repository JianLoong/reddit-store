It\u2019s unfortunate that your parents consistently downsized your birthday acknowledgement significantly from the celebration they always had for your brother.

Otherwise they wouldn\u2019t feel the need to give your brother big parties when they do have the money.\n\nTbh my guess is this isn\u2019t just birthdays where you\u2019ve taken the back seat to some pretty clear favoritism.", "INFO - Why didn't you mention the fact that sibling got good birthdays while you did not? \n\nThat seems to be the reason, yet you never told them when they asked your directly.", "NTA. I don't understand how your parents had money for a birthday party before christmas, but not after... both times are tighter than usual in my family, because you're buying presents throughout the month, then food for the holiday. If it's not tight, it's because you save ahead of time or buy presents throughout the year, which could also be done for birthdays.", "NTA op. My birthday was at the start of dec. My brother were in feb and june. I was ALWAYS told you will get something small for yor birthday and a bigger present for xmas because they were so close (i never did) i asked for a bike for 3 years in a row, never got it but my brothers got brand new mountain bikes that were just thrown in the shed after a month. There were times i never even got a cake and barely acknowledged in the day as i went into my teens.\n\n My eldests bday is now a week before mine and i always make sure she has the same as her other sisters when it comes to birthdays. That stuff stays with you. \n\nGo enjoy your 21st party without guilt. You deserve it x", "NTA I get the logic of why your birthday wasn't as grand given the timeline but they could have budgeted.\n\nDid they ever actually give you a bigger gift or w/e a month later?\n\nAre there other instances of your brother having favoritism?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly as an adult now you should feel free to calmly tell them the truth about how you feel, laying out everything as clearly as you did here.", "NTA. And I\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t had a good birthday party. Happy 21st birthday tomorrow; I hope you have an amazing party!", "I think it might be more like someone else said, they just can't budget well. Dec birthday, big bday. Xmas? Lots of gifts, Jan bday? Well shit we're broke, let's keep it small and simple.\n\nEither way, NTA.", "I've discussed the whole favoritsm with my parents ever since I was 15 ish. The conversations never end well and there was this one time when my mom completely did not talk to me for a whole day. Their reason always revolved around the fact that he was younger and when he was a baby he was hospitalized. So I never mention it because when I do they don't really take it srsly they start playfully babying me/baby talk and yeah I never bring it up. I also started thinking that I was just being selfish and irrational every time I think that so ppl rn commenting and confirming that my hunches were right makes me feel betrayed and manipulated.", "NTA. Mine is on the 28 of December and in my 31 years of life I can remember celebrating with a party like 2 times in my childhood.

It can be tricky but it\u2019s nonnegotiable", "NTA. My birthday is pretty close to Christmas and it was always a logistical nightmare to gather people to celebrate it. Last year I finally did something and I actually did TWO parties, one the day before with a group of friends and one the very day with another, and it actually felt so nice to finally throw a celebration for myself.\n\n(On the other hand, when I was a kid we were ALWAYS tight on money, so all birthday parties for any of my siblings were pretty much a homemade cake and singing happy birthday. I think part of the problem here is more like the double standard)", "NTA It's really not that weird to go all out for your birthday, especially not a milestone like your 21st.\nSome people like to go all out, some people prefer to have a smaller celebration, both are acceptable. You wouldn't have said that if they hadn't taken an issue with you having a bigger celebration in the first place, they asked you answered.", "Sounds like they didn't have a hard time celebrating for your brother though or recognizing the value of celebrating for his birthday.

I know about taking down decorations quickly so there's no overlap. And because of that, I have made it a point to set aside the same dollar amount for each of them. I never touched it for other holidays or events. \n\nMy MIL would consistently short the twins and claim she didn't have enough set aside, but her favorite grandchild who has a birthday soon after Christmas? Never a problem for her. One of the many, many reasons my kids don't maintain a close relationship with her. \n\nConsidering that it's your parents playing favorites, that's even more messed up; parents are the ones who are most supposed to consider fairness in the way they treat their kids. There will always be differences, no helping that, but parents are supposed to *try*. Yours just made excuses. And still are.", "NTA. After the first time they couldn't afford to celebrate your birthday, they should have started saving so they could be sure to have some money for your next birthday. Money that wasn't to be spent on christmas. I know the feeling of having birthdays ignored. I'm 52 and have never had a party. Ever. Brother and sister did - but never me.\n\nYou have the party you want and you deserve. And don't invite anyone who doesn't support you!", "This for me only for my 50th....

My parents were the same. NTA.", "Nta. And its okay to acknowledge their favoritism because if money was gonna be tight they knew that before they set up these big parties for ur brother they continued to splurge on him and leave you in the dust all while blaming it on holidays when they could simply cut ur brothers birthday budget so u could have one too now that ur older and can call it out they must be feeling guilty or embarrassed but none of that is ur fault.", "NTA?? Your parents are mad you are DARING to throw yourself a blowout bash? You\u2019re never allowed to have anything more extravagant than what they gave you? That\u2019s insane behavior.\n\nAre they going to limit where you\u2019re allowed to vacation and what food you\u2019re allowed to eat to only where they\u2019ve been and what they\u2019ve tried? Bizarre behavior", "NTA. My birthday is the 12th and even when my mum didn't have much money, she would still make me a cake and get me a small gift. I had parties when I was younger (didn't want them when I was older, turns out I'm autistic)  and she never made me feel like my birthday wasn't important just because it's so close to Christmas. Your parents prioritised your brother over you and you absolutely deserve a great party for your 21st! \n\nHappy birthday for tomorrow OP, I hope you have an amazing day and a great time with your friends.", "It makes it easier for her parents to look back on the discrepancy in how they treated their children if they can convince themselves she liked simpler things, she appreciated their company, she wasn't materialistic, she was a good girl who put relationships before things. Post-decision rationalistation. Her mother may really have convince herself but this large-scale 21st b'day forces her to re-evaluate and that's not a nice feeling for her. Deserved though.", "When she said 2 holidays I assumed Christmas and New Years.   Either way, they could have set money aside for OP.  They chose not to.  Year after year.", "Please consider going on an information diet with your parents.  It seems like positive things in your life upset them, so just don't bring it up.

The issue is that they DID have money when it was your brothers birthday, but not when it was yours, not so much. So he \"grew older getting some expensive gifts he wanted and he would have parties in school. \" but you got \"we'll give your gifts in a month\".\n\nYou can say they didn't have favorites, but any child would be upset when they notice a blatant inbalance in something like birthdays.", "NTA\n\nI know I'm cynical because I'm wondering if the parents perhaps don't want her spending money \"extravagantly\" because of unstated expectations that she would be subsidizing any current, imminent, or future financial crisis that would befall them. Maybe a good time to have one of those conversations about their retirement.\n\nThose folks are just messed up; when someone spends their own money on something they're proud of, no matter you feel personally, the correct response is \"wow, that must be exciting, I am happy for you.\" Like.

Your parents should have budgeted their money better for the holidays and you and your siblings Birthdays. Money's tight for me but I always plan and order things like 3-6 months ahead.

My daughters 5 Birthday would be in July and I'm currently pregnant and Baby is due March so I'm gonna order my daughters decorations and gifts like right now so I don't have to worry about the costs and I want both my kids to be comfortable and loved equally.", "Enjoy your party! Just the way you want.", "NTA. They failed as parents. The favoritism is jarring. It's one thing if they couldn't afford it but they deliberately gave your younger brother expensive presents and threw him birthday parties. Good on you for finally standing up for yourself. Don't apologize for finally expressing yourself. Go low/no contact if they keep acting like assholes.", "I would be asking my parents why they are upset that OP is getting the \"grand birthday.\" What about OP having nice things and being celebrated is so offensive to them. If they have issues about not ever really celebrating OP like they did her brother, that is a them issue.", "+ can we point out the obvious please ?\n\nChristmas is the same month as brother and NYE as OP. Funny how they could afford to make one kid happy about their day but the other just needed to understand, when both parties and their expenses are as close as both kids birthday.

Why did you always have to sacrifice your bday and your brother didn\u2019t?", "I was about to say the same, their birthday is well enough away from Christmas that there's no reason it couldn't have been planned for. And it's not a surprise event either, it's annual and money could be set aside each year in anticipation. It sounds like their parents are just burnt out by 3-4 consecutive celebrations and just didn't want to bother for a possible 5th.  The parent's reaction for being called out on it is pretty telling.", "> they start playfully babying me/baby talk \n\nThey infantilized you in a mocking manner as a teenager because you brought up the inequity between you and your brother?
