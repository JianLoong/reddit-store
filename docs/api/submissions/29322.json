We both work from home, her office is in the guest room, and mine's in the separate ADU / Laundry-room / Garage...\n\n My older sister by 6yrs, with whom I am very close, lives in Boston with her husband and their two adorable and well-behaved 4 & 6-year-olds. She has visited us once on her own briefly during a business trip, and has finally decided to bring her family for another stay. Her family has never been to California.\n\nAs a good husband, sensitive  to, and aware of my German, Pisces & only child wife's personality with a strong dedication to routine & rigorous habits, I had initially told my sister to ideally find an Airbnb close to our house, and we would celebrate Christmas together there or at our place. That conversation was quick and we decided to follow-up and consolidate the plan over the coming weekend...\n\nOn the follow-up call, it turns out my sister is sad not to stay with us altogether, she wants to have a proper Christmas family experience with us altogether, and she's afraid we won't be able to properly hang out if we are all in different places. It is not at all a money issue! Our home is cozy and warm, picture kids waking up early to open their gifts under the Christmas tree... Even my mom chimes in (also on the call) saying it's ridiculous to not host them considering the size of our home and their short stay. Sister says our king-size bed can sleep all four of them easily. In my mind, problem solved! We sleep in the guest room, if my wife needs to work, she has her office available and I can peace out when she does.\n\nJust told her over the phone, HUGE ARGUMENT! \"*No way I'm not sleeping in my own bed in my own home... That was not the plan, it's unacceptable, not ok with this*!\" She says... \n\nWTF! She tells me our home is way too small to have all four of them here, I said it's also my home, and we have a GUEST ROOM that is also her office, it's for only 3 nights, and it's important for me and my family... It became a big fuckin deal, she's convinced she's right and even says \"*Anyone would agree with me on this one\",* and I'm wondering,                    **AM I THE ASSHOLE?**\n\n**Do you agree with her?

Having family stay at an Airbnb/ hotel doesn\u2019t mean that they can do pretty much everything but shower and sleep at your house. Lastly, what\u2019s with the bigoted comments about your wife? Not cool at all\u2026", "You are absolutely the asshole. You don't just invite your entire family into your home without asking your wife! Especially in such a small space. You can dress it up as romantically as you like, you are changing the whole dynamic with no consideration of permission of your life partner", "YTA. You don't invite people to sleep over your house without your partners permission. You definitely don't invite them for three nights and offer to kick your wife out of her room to do so.\n\nI say this as a person who would be THRILLED to have my whole extended family sleep over my house for three nights. I think its so much fun to have family sleep over! Not everyone thinks its fun. And it sounds like you knew your wife wouldn't want this, so you decided you'd ask for forgiveness later and hope her sense of obligation would make her give in. If you had talked to your wife, maybe you could have come up with a compromise that made everyone happy. Now she's just (rightfully) pissed.\n\nAnd no offense, but 1000 sq ft of home is not all that big for six people. Not saying its tiny, but your mom saying its ridiculous not to host them because of the size of your house is itself ridiculous. If you had a guest cottage or enough bedrooms that you and your wife could stay in your own bedroom maayybee that could help justify it. But for two bedroom 100 sq ft house, an extra four people for three days is going to feel like a lot.", "Huge yta\n\nFirst off, if you had actually *talked* with your wife first, she might have been receptive to them staying in the guest room. There's a need, throw down an air mattress, easy peasy.\n\nYou instead said nothing, and gave up *her* bed on top of it. Yes, your bed too, but it's also 50% hers, and it's not exactly something you can loan half of, so if your plan isn't to use your half, then it's all hers. \n\nFor your last four, in bold, questions. \n\n1- yes, yes you are the asshole.\n\n2- I agree with her. You decided her input wasn't important in her own home, and regarding her own bed. \n\n3- I would have *talked* with my wife first. That's how you keep a marriage going. \n\n4- the help would be advising you to salvage situation. Run the idea of your family staying in the guest room, which would make sense, seeing as how they'd be *guests*. If your wife says no, it's because you waited to run it by her after talking to everyone *except* the people that actually live in the house.", "Sorry, another YTA vote. Also, if you take it back now, that will make your wife look like the villain. You have put her in a terrible position. You should never agree to something like that without speaking to her. Nor should you even suggest to your family that you agree but need your wife\u2019s permission.\n\nIn the future say, \u201cokay this is something [wife\u2019s name] and I will consider together and get back to you.\u201d", "Obvious YTA. I don't understand why people like you get married if this is your mentality about relationships. You have zero respect for your wife here", "Jesus, you\u2019re dense. You and your family railroaded your wife into doing something she didn\u2019t want to do. And no, it doesn\u2019t matter than she\u2019s German, or a Pisces, or whatever else you used to passively put her down. Having someone stay at your house is a 2 yes, 1 no situation, especially if you\u2019re kicking her out of her own bed. YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou should have talked to your wife first. It's her home, too. Not only are you inviting 4 people into her home, but you literally gave them her bed as well.\n\nYou have to always check in on the other inhabitants of a house before inviting people over. Especially when it's four of them. \n\nYou literally talked about it to your MOTHER, who doesn't live with you, before your wife, who actually does.", "YTA for a few things. You invited your sister and her family to stay with you without discussing it with your wife. You then gave up your bed to your sister and her family without discussing it with her.  You don\u2019t get to make unilateral decisions that impact your wife and her work without discussing it with her.", "\u2018Houseguests\u2019 require a yes from both spouses.\nExpecting her to give up her bed? There\u2019s no reason she should do that. Especially on Christmas. It\u2019s her holiday too. \n\nYour sister needs to get her own accommodations for her visit . YTA", "YTA, massively. \nYes, it's your home, but it's not just your home. It's also your wife's home. \nNot only did you invite 4 people to stay for multiple nights, you kicked your wife out of HER bedroom and HER bed to sleep in the guest room. Her sign or heritage or even personality don't matter. She's your spouse, your partner. Major decisions, like allowing people to stay at your house for multiple days while displacing you from your room and bed, should be discussed with your partner BEFORE they're decided upon. \nYou've just shown your wife (and all of here) that you don't really care about her feelings or boundaries. If my husband pulled this, I would absolutely die on this hill.", "YTA. Decisions about overnight guests must be made together.  Even if it were just one night, I'd be upset if my husband didn't talk to me first. I'd make an exception if it were an emergency of course but for holidays? Nope.", "YTA. \n\nYou offered up the marital bed to 4 people without even asking the other person who shares that bed. Not cool, OP. A hotel, motel or air Bnb would be better for the family to stay at, then you can eat and open presents together. \n\nI mean did you expect you wife to cook, clean and host for 3 days while they were staying as well, again  without asking her or did you plan to help my dude?", "Huge YTA. \n\nThis is a discussion, two yeses situation and you failed miserably.  Cramming 6 people into 1000 sq ft place for the holidays no less without consent of one of the key people involved is selfish at best. Expecting your wife to give up her office and her bed in the process also makes you a dick. \n\nNot having all the family under one tiny roof doesn't mean you can't have a family Christmas. \n\nHopefully your wife books herself a bnb so she can enjoy the holiday while you enjoy all the time you can possibly want with and hosting your family.", "You are the asshole. You don\u2019t live alone. You share a small home with your wife. You absolutely clear that with your wife before making plans like that. A good partner clears house guests with their significant other even when there\u2019s no consideration of overnight guests, much less giving up one\u2019s own bed to the guests. You\u2019re in the doghouse and you deserve it.", "I have to side with your wife. YTA. A bedroom is such an intimate personal space that i can understand that she doesn't want your family staying there. I would try to find a compromise like renting an Airbnb that is big enough to accommodate you and your wife as well as your sister's family.", "YTA \n\nYou care more about your sister's feelings and your mother\u2019s opinion than you do about your wife's feelings and her opinion. Seriously,  you just screwed your wife over , set her up to fail at having a decent relationship with your sister and mother, all because you couldn't be bothered to ask her how she would feel about having people in her home. Or maybe it's because you've never told mummy and sissy no? \n\nIf and it's a big if, this goes ahead, your entitled sister can buy an air mattress for the guest room and sleep on that with her family. After all, if it's that important to her to be under the same roof, she gets to make the sacrifices.", "YTA.\n\n1. ALWAYS consult your spouse before inviting anyone into your shared home. Discuss who will be responsible for extra cleaning, meals, entertainment etc as part of that discussion.\n\n\n2. Do NOT give up your marital bed. Especially without your spouses' ok. Consider: You really think your wife would want to be intimate with you, after picturing your sister, her husband and kids sharing the bed? Do you? Even after washing the bedding afterwards, some people are very particular about who sleeps in their bed as it's a safe, intimate space for some people.\n\n\n3. Do you have more than 1 bathroom? 6 people sharing one bathroom- ick. Think of the timing of showers, needing to pee, etc.\n\n\n4. Did your wife even agree to spent Christmas with your family? What if she wanted to spend it with hers? Was this even discussed?\n\n\n5. Would you want to sleep in your office, so family can have your space? Could you easily relax and sleep well, knowing you're surrounded by your work stuff?  My office space doesn't exactly make me feel peaceful and comfortable.\n\n\n6. If your sister and her family are in your bedroom, are there personal items that would need to be hidden? What if you or your wife needed extra clothes or something from the bedroom, and now there are 4 extra people in the room, in the way? Why should your wife have to be inconvenienced, and removed from her room, her bed, and easy access to her belongings, without her permission or consent?\n\n\n7. Why would you repeatedly discuss it with your sister, and even your mom, and not your WIFE?\n\n\n8. Does your wife even feel comfortable enough to spend 3 solid days with your sister and her family?", "YTA because that guest room is her office and you didn\u2019t even discuss it with your wife first. So now she looks like the jackass while you look like the Jolly Green Giant. Seriously who the Fuck gives away someone\u2019s bed in their own home without talking to them first??? What the fuck", "YTA. You volunteered your own bed and room for your sister, without talking with your wife\u2026yes, that\u2019s ridiculous. AND you really let your sister and mom bully you into it, without considering to even ask your wife first. \n\nI would be pissed as hell if my husband did this.", "YTA\n\nYES, you need your wife's inout before inviting family for 3 days over. The way you wrote this has me cringing. \n\nLiKe aNy GoOd HuSbAnD oh stfu. You backtracked as soon as possible. A good husband regards his wife's input.", "YTA. Also before you go offering to pay for your sister\u2019s hotel or AirBNB - DON\u2019T. That\u2019s another decision to make with your wife. Your family host (ie you & your wife). That\u2019s already a significant expense. Your sister\u2019s family pays for their own stay.\n\nEdit/ to add: your mom & sis are very inconsiderate too. How would they feel if their husbands kicked them out of their bedrooms on their day off? Yet no reservations when manipulating you.", "Wow, is this even real?  A 1000 square foot house, 2 bedrooms in California, is not considered big enough to have 6 people sleeping in it when one bedroom is converted into an office space....\n\nMaybe if you have a 3000 square foot house with 5 bedrooms, it would be okay.", "I agree with your wife. YTA big time. Start groveling because you f**ked up.", "YTA. \n\n1. For how you spoke about your wife\n\n2. You clearly were aware she\u2019d hate hosting or you wouldn\u2019t have suggested the airbnb in the first place\n\n3. Offering to host without discussing it with THE OTHER PERSON WHO LIVES THERE!\n\n4. Offering up your bedroom for guests.\n\nThe only thing you did right in this whole scenario was saying about staying at the Airbnb and you crumpled like paper on that \n\nYour poor wife", "Yta for sure and I can see you've been told all the reasons. Why not get an Air BNB big enough for your sisters family AND you and your wife to stay in. Get the spaces you need and the family vibe your sister wants.", "YTA personally I think your house sounds a little small for the amount of people you invited. Especially considering there are children who can, depending on the age, be loud and rambunctious and may make it difficult for your wife to work from home. However the size of your house isn\u2019t the real problem. This house is both of your home, and since your wife is your partner the respectful thing to have done was talk to her before you offered your home, let alone bed. That was really thoughtless of you and you owe her a big apology. \nYou mention that money isn\u2019t an issue why don\u2019t you look into renting a bigger place to share with your sisters family and split the cost. That way you\u2019ll all be together but preferably not on top of each other. \nLastly your wife\u2019s opinion about your home trumps your families opinion. I know it can be hard when you\u2019re receiving pressure from your family but they\u2019re not the ones you\u2019re in a partnership with. Try to be more respectful and thoughtful in the future", "YTA.  You should have checked with your wife.", "YTA.   The whole entire ass.  You volunteered to throw your wife out of her own bed/bedroom?  Are you seriously that clueless?  What makes you think that is ok?  You didn't even ask her about it. You just informed her that she will not have access to her own bed and bedroom for 3 days.  And who will be responsible for cleaning up after this entire family of people?  Is your wife going to be expected to sleep in her office by night, work all day, and then clean up after your family the rest of the time?  Change bedding and all that behind these folks?  Nope.  You are so wrong for this.  This is what hotels and BNB's are for.  You should probably try to fix this ASAP.  Maybe you and your family can go rent one hotel room and all cram yourselves into a bed together so you can experience the togetherness.", "I mean, I didn't even have to read the text to know YTA.\n\nYou have the conversation with your wife first.  Likely would have gone very differently.", "If I were this wife, I\u2019d say \u201csure honey, give them our room\u201d. Then I\u2019d go right to the most expensive, luxurious hotel in the area, rent the finest suite, and enjoy 3 days of room service and pampering. I\u2019d make it clear to husband he\u2019s neither invited nor welcome. Then have him pay the bill. Done.", "YTA. Not only for not discussing it with your wife first, but because you admitted you KNEW she would be against this.\n\nAnd offering her bed? Come on.\n\nYour sister and mother are assholes too.", "YTA. Every woman\u2019s opinion matters except your WIFE. Priorities, my dude.", "YTA.  That is also her bed and her house and you aren't the manager of the property.  This should have been a conversation with your wife before you commit.\n\nYou need to call your family back, let them know that your house isn't large enough and that they need an AirBnB.  And don't you dare imply this is your wife's fault because it's yours for not consulting her.", "YTA. It's your wife's home too. It's HER BED too.", ">In my mind, problem solved!\n\nThat's the problem here. You *completely* skipped over asking your wife. It was not your sole decision to make.    \n\n>I said it's also my home\n\n\"Also\" being the key word, here. It's not just yours. You don't get to make unilateral decisions in these matters. That's not how it works.    \n\nYTA, and a thoughtless one at that.", "YTA you don\u2019t make unilateral decisions about important things in a relationship", "YTA and you were absolutely not sensitive to your wife\u2019s personality to immediately bend to your family\u2019s wishes on a follow-up call. Honestly! Always always always ask your spouse before inviting any house guests\u2014especially when you offer them your wife\u2019s bed.", "YTA, you got super guilt tripped by your family. Now you\u2019re entrenched in your argument despite clearly knowing your wife would not be ok with this. Your lines about family togetherness fail to take into account that a \u201cguest room\u201d is not a guest room if it\u2019s her OFFICE. Ooh, how cozy to have your life partner relegated to her workspace on Xmas morning. How nice to ensure she has no peace or privacy. \nI hope you\u2019re a troll, honestly, because I can\u2019t imagine having to deal with a partner who dropped his family on my head during the holiday season and then tried to act like a martyr.", "YTA. You were becoming a bigger and bigger ah as I read on. Not only did you not get your wife\u2019s ok about having overnight guests (and don\u2019t go on the whole spiel of my house too) you offered up the master bedroom. Your wife is also having to give up her office space. There\u2019s times. Either tell your sister that it will be hard and they should look into an air bnb or you guys go in together on a big air bnb so everyone can stay there and celebrate Christmas.", "you have a tiny house\u2026 how is 1000sq ft large enough to host that many people comfortably? you want your wife to be stressed and not enjoy her christmas? why would you not discuss with her first? so many reasons. YTA.", "YTA.  Do you have any idea what you've done to her?  \n\nFirst, you volunteer her bedroom as the site for four extra people.  Her bedroom.  I know it's yours too, but all her clothes, her makeup, her sex toys for god sakes are in her bedroom.   You suggest that you both sleep in the guest room?  You are an idiot.\n\nSecond, catering for six people, two of them adorable but probably picky people is hard work that requires a ton of planning.  And it's not just breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks that will need to be provided, it's all the little extras that will need to be done.  BTW, three meals a day for an extra four people is 36 extra meals she has to plan, shop for, cook and clean up afterwards.  That's a ton of work.  \n\nThird.  She'll have to do the \"company is coming\" clean up of the entire house and stock extra stuff like make sure there are plenty of towels, toilet paper ect.  That is a ton of work.\n\nFourth.  This is Christmas you're talking about.  And nobody does Christmas like a German.  Special dishes, gifts and everything else will need to be prepared.\n\nFifth:  No matter how this gets changed, your wife looks like the bad guy and you put her there.\n\nI honestly don't know how you apologize for being a short sighted idiot.  But please try.", "YTA - You should discuss it with your wife first, of course. But you went way over the line when you offered your bed to someone else.\n\nThat\u2019s just weird, no wonder your wife completely over reacted.", "Yta all the way", "YTA.", "YTA. You decided your sister\u2019s feeling were more important than any type of (very reasonable) way your wife might be feeling.", "Massive YTA. The wife should always be consulted about guests in the house. Also, letting your sister sleep in you and your wife\u2019s king bed?! Massive ah right there.

You WAY overstepped.", "YTA.\n\nYou not only completely changed the plan without speaking to your wife, you decided to just put 4 extra people in a 1000 sqft house (I live in a 1080 sqft house and it is not big enough for 6 people to comfortably coexist. If I was married I'd go nuts with 2 more adults and 2 kids crammed in here too), you offered them *her bedroom* without asking her and messed up her work space by deciding you'd both just sleep in there.\n\nIf you want to recreate your childhood Christmases, you and your sister and her family can go stay at your parents' house for 3 days.", "YTA SO MUCH YTA.\nYou both have to agree.", "You agreed to move your wife out of her bedroom workout consulting with her first??? You don\u2019t need Reddit to tell you that this defies even the most common of common sense. You didn\u2019t mean to disrespect her, but this was careless and not a point to be argued. YTA. Go fix this. Apologize and help your sister find lodging nearby.", "YTA. 2br (of which one is an office of a WFH  person) 1000 sq feet is too small for 6 people. You expect your wife to be in that guest room/ office all day to work and all night to sleep while playing host to 4 other people and didn\u2019t even bother to ask her.

Holy crap\u2026 my husband and I have a 6.5 and almost 5 year old and i would NEVER inconvenience my BIL like this - EVER. And you may think 1000 sq ft is big for you and your wife but let me tell you - it\u2019s not when you consider your sister will be bringing her husband, kids and ALL their stuff AND presents! The fact that your sister also had the audacity to claim you and your wife\u2019s bed is also mind boggling to me. Overstepping sooo many boundaries and you were totally all for it. \n\nI would immediately call your sister and tell her original plans need to be adhered to - she needs to get an Airbnb.

Expect divorce papers for Chirstmas.", "YTA for not discussing it and I\u2019d never give up my bed or room. We had friends stay for a week not too long ago. We hand a king air mattress for them and their kids slept on the sofas in sleeping bags and we had an extra queen air mattress if needed. They had the run of the living room, dining room, full guest bathroom and all. We had a blast hanging out and I had my room left alone", "YTA. You literally gave up you and your wife's house to your sister and her family. Even are letting them sleep in your marital bed. I would be mad too. Yes, you live their too but you should have had a discussion with your wife before you just went and offered up your bed and home. Kids are loud and messy. Hope you like sleeping in the guest room by yourself", "YTA. In my mind, the best way to get out of this without making your wife look like TA is to find an Airbnb that's bigger than your house that you all stay at together (if your wife is on board with it). You can bring your decorations from home to decorate together and do all the Hallmark wholesome family Christmas celebration stuff together in a space that's big enough to be comfortable for everyone.", "YTA here 100%  Overnight guests is a two yes one no situation.  Come on now and be truthful here-- you knew how your wife would feel about this and decided to put one over on her.  \n\nI doubt this is going to be the picture post card Christmas you were hoping for LOL.", "YTA, for the reasons others have said.\nWhy don't you get a huge air bnb for everyone in the family in Cali and stay with them there?", "YTA: always ask.  Some people are introverts and need their space and quiet to recharge.", "YTA. Dude. You are supposed to be a TEAM. You are PARTNERS. You don't make decisions involving BOTH of you unilaterally.\n\nNo pets, no kids, no overnight guests, no redecorating, no large purchases, no vacations, no holiday plans, without BOTH of you discussing it AHEAD of time and AGREEING to the plan.", "YTA. You don\u2019t live alone, nor purchased the house alone. It is disrespectful to change the plans and give up your marital bed to boot. Your sister needs to stay in an Airbnb as originally planned. Make it large enough you could spend the night if you and your wife choose to do so.", "YTA. You made a decision to kick your wife out of her space when you've already got a guest room. Ypu don't  invite FOUR people  over without discussion, hell any people. \n\nIf money isn't an issue then buy blow up mattresses for the kids, and the problem is also solved. This plan only works IF your wife isn't working at that time and won't need her office.", "I had an EX like you....and that's one of many many reasons he is an x. YTA btw. Massively. You didn't talk to your wife at all and you literally gave away her bed too.", "YTA.  You invited four people to stay in your house, in your bed for 3 days without consulting your wife? You have a lot of excuses, but no reasons. And you really think your MOM agreeing with you will sway people?\n\n Your sister wanted a free place! That's it.\n\n\nWho will be cooking for all 6 of you? Who will clean up after all six of you? I bet it's not you. And for all that, your wife gets to be a guest in her own home? Holy clueless, Batman!\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n1.) You invited them into a shared space without the consent of the others who are also owners of said space.\n2.) you volunteered to give your sister your bed in your bedroom when that is also your wife\u2019s bed (again without the other owners consent). \n3.) you volunteered and expect your wife to give up her office space because it\u2019s the guest room when she also works from home, without her consent (can be compromised that she uses your office and you find somewhere else to work). \n\nYou claim it\u2019s important for you and your extended family. Extended because that is what your sister became when you got married. Your immediate family is your wife and any children you may have. If it was so important then they would get a hotel so that they can spend the holiday with you not try and expect your wife to accommodate what they want because they don\u2019t like the idea of staying in a hotel.

We both work from home, her office is in the guest room, and mine's in the separate ADU / Laundry-room / Garage...\n\n My older sister by 6yrs, with whom I am very close, lives in Boston with her husband and their two adorable and well-behaved 4 & 6-year-olds. She has visited us once on her own briefly during a business trip, and has finally decided to bring her family for another stay. Her family has never been to California.\n\nAs a good husband, sensitive  to, and aware of my German, Pisces & only child wife's personality with a strong dedication to routine & rigorous habits, I had initially told my sister to ideally find an Airbnb close to our house, and we would celebrate Christmas together there or at our place. That conversation was quick and we decided to follow-up and consolidate the plan over the coming weekend...\n\nOn the follow-up call, it turns out my sister is sad not to stay with us altogether, she wants to have a proper Christmas family experience with us altogether, and she's afraid we won't be able to properly hang out if we are all in different places. It is not at all a money issue! Our home is cozy and warm, picture kids waking up early to open their gifts under the Christmas tree... Even my mom chimes in (also on the call) saying it's ridiculous to not host them considering the size of our home and their short stay. Sister says our king-size bed can sleep all four of them easily. In my mind, problem solved! We sleep in the guest room, if my wife needs to work, she has her office available and I can peace out when she does.\n\nJust told her over the phone, HUGE ARGUMENT! \"*No way I'm not sleeping in my own bed in my own home... That was not the plan, it's unacceptable, not ok with this*!\" She says... \n\nWTF! She tells me our home is way too small to have all four of them here, I said it's also my home, and we have a GUEST ROOM that is also her office, it's for only 3 nights, and it's important for me and my family... It became a big fuckin deal, she's convinced she's right and even says \"*Anyone would agree with me on this one\",* and I'm wondering,                    **AM I THE ASSHOLE?**\n\n**Do you agree with her?

Your family starts with your wife. And you effed your own family up to appease your sister. Fix it.", "YTA.  You have to discuss these kind of things with your partner.

When I saw your house size, no shame but size matters here, and how many additional people AND that you use every inch, you were the AH. Not telling your wife first upped that status. Thinking you can give up your/her bedroom to family upped it further. The fact you are blind enough to not see that your sister most likely didn't want to pay to stay somewhere, and then asking to put you out of your own bedroom, makes you also a moron. Holy shit.

Instead of having time to process, you gave her only time to react. And now if you tell your family no, she\u2019s gonna get the blame for it.
