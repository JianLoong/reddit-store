Lots has happened in the meanwhile, so I'll try to keep it short.\n\nFirst. I sat my BF down for a chat as soon as I saw him again (which was the day following our discussion). He agreed that we needed to talk, and told me he was sorry for calling me an asshole, that that he had been so much in shock that he hardly even remembered the whole fight in the first place.\n\nI told him I could understand that, and told him I love him and wanted to be there for him and support him throughout this ordeal. I also added, though, that I would need him to be able to stick up for me in the future, even against his daughter, who would be grieving and in a lot of pain. I told him to think about it, and let me know, and also said that I would keep his daughter for as long as he needed me to independently from his answer.\n\nHe asked me to marry him on the spot (no ring or anything, but he was crying and it was very sweet), so now we're engaged and relatively happy.\n\nSecond. T passed away a week later. I followed your suggestion, and didn't see her again. G is living full time with us now, and I have what I think are if not good, hopeful news.\n\nTen days after her mother's death, she broke down in hysterics because she wanted her mom. It was an incredibly sad moment. She kept yelling insults at me and crying and again yelling at me.\n\nI was in tears, because seeing a child in that much pain is truly heart wrenching. So I intervened before my Fiancee could say anything, told G that I couldn't bear to see her so distressed and that I would go stay with a friend until she felt a bit better. That I loved her, and just wanted her to be less sad.\n\nShe ran to me, hugged me and begged me not to leave her. We cried together, and I think we might be on the road to healing.\n\nThat is to say, thank you Reddit folks for your feedback. You're awesome.", "created_utc": 1677232874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11anu3g/update_wibta_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_bfs/", "score": 382, "replies": ["So happy to read the last paragraph of your update. It's incredibly sad for all of you, and after what T put you through (eventhough she must have been very distressed to be dying, leaving such a young kid without a mother), you're incredibly strong and good to the core to still handle it the way you are. \n\nI hope you manage to build a strong relationship with G and have a happy mariage.", "Original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10elpe1/wibta_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_bfs_daughter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Question- when you said his decision to stick up for you or not wouldn't affect your decision to watch her, I dunno what I'm trying to say... what would you have done if he didn't stick up for you? Regardless I'm glad you got resolution and I hope she gets Therapy for her loss.", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "i hope she's doing alright", "Broke up but still watch the kid", "This is heartbreaking, but I'm glad you guys are making things work... if you can look into grief counselling for them; she lost her mom and he lost his childhood friend and partner for 15 years, they gonna need help building cope mechanisms to navigate this pain. \n\n\nWishing yall the very best.", "Wow, I think you are on the road to be what these two individuals need at this moment, and I hope you will gain happiness from that. What a heartwarming update!", "Omg this is so sad but so\u2026 joyful at the same time. I wish you all the best!", "This is a beautiful story. It is good to see such a happy ending.  I am still crying reading and re reading this. I wish I could meet you all in person and give you a hug. Life is hard. People die, we go through depressions, self cutting and all those horrible things in life. We need hugs. I wish Im you were here to hug me. I am working on no longer cutting. Thank you for your message of hope and love. I wish you were here to give me a hug.  I love you.", "OP, please check if there a kid's grief groups in your area. It helps many kids to realise they are not alone in this. And if she wants, make sure she has a good picture of her mom in her room. Make sure she knows she can talk of her. And look that she gets enough mementos of her mother. Sometimes women have different thoughts about what they would like to have from their moms than men. Better keep a few things more than not enough (if possible). Good luck to all of you.", "Thank you for this update and for being such a good person.\nI am glad to read this and I am glad your step-daughter has you in your life \u2764!", "I just read your original post and this update.\n\nOh boy. That is heavy. I'm sorry for the loss everyone is feeling right now. I know it's tough. Despite your rocky relationship, I am sure it's a bit of a bittersweet realization for you.\n\nYour stepdaughter is going to be grieving and reacting in so many different ways. She will probably push you away. She needs some unconditional love right now. And maybe some therapy to help her with the grief.\n\nBest of luck to all of you.", "I think you handled the situation as well as possible.  G will always remember that you cared enough about her happiness to be willing to step aside if that's what she needed.  Ironically, by offering to leave, you created stability for her by respecting her feelings and showing you value her.\n\nI wish you and your family all the best in the future.", "> here\n\nThank you!", "Who cares that's not how it happened."]}
