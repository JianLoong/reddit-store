Lots has happened in the meanwhile, so I'll try to keep it short.\n\nFirst. I sat my BF down for a chat as soon as I saw him again (which was the day following our discussion). He agreed that we needed to talk, and told me he was sorry for calling me an asshole, that that he had been so much in shock that he hardly even remembered the whole fight in the first place.\n\nI told him I could understand that, and told him I love him and wanted to be there for him and support him throughout this ordeal. I also added, though, that I would need him to be able to stick up for me in the future, even against his daughter, who would be grieving and in a lot of pain. I told him to think about it, and let me know, and also said that I would keep his daughter for as long as he needed me to independently from his answer.\n\nHe asked me to marry him on the spot (no ring or anything, but he was crying and it was very sweet), so now we're engaged and relatively happy.\n\nSecond. T passed away a week later. I followed your suggestion, and didn't see her again. G is living full time with us now, and I have what I think are if not good, hopeful news.\n\nTen days after her mother's death, she broke down in hysterics because she wanted her mom. It was an incredibly sad moment. She kept yelling insults at me and crying and again yelling at me.\n\nI was in tears, because seeing a child in that much pain is truly heart wrenching. So I intervened before my Fiancee could say anything, told G that I couldn't bear to see her so distressed and that I would go stay with a friend until she felt a bit better. That I loved her, and just wanted her to be less sad.\n\nShe ran to me, hugged me and begged me not to leave her. We cried together, and I think we might be on the road to healing.\n\nThat is to say, thank you Reddit folks for your feedback. You're awesome.", "created_utc": 1677232874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11anu3g/update_wibta_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_bfs/", "score": 1032, "replies": ["So happy to read the last paragraph of your update. It's incredibly sad for all of you, and after what T put you through (eventhough she must have been very distressed to be dying, leaving such a young kid without a mother), you're incredibly strong and good to the core to still handle it the way you are. \n\nI hope you manage to build a strong relationship with G and have a happy mariage.", "Original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10elpe1/wibta_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_bfs_daughter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Question- when you said his decision to stick up for you or not wouldn't affect your decision to watch her, I dunno what I'm trying to say... what would you have done if he didn't stick up for you? Regardless I'm glad you got resolution and I hope she gets Therapy for her loss.", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "i hope she's doing alright", "Broke up but still watch the kid", "This is heartbreaking, but I'm glad you guys are making things work... if you can look into grief counselling for them; she lost her mom and he lost his childhood friend and partner for 15 years, they gonna need help building cope mechanisms to navigate this pain. \n\n\nWishing yall the very best.", "Wow, I think you are on the road to be what these two individuals need at this moment, and I hope you will gain happiness from that. What a heartwarming update!", "Omg this is so sad but so\u2026 joyful at the same time. I wish you all the best!", "This is a beautiful story. It is good to see such a happy ending.  I am still crying reading and re reading this. I wish I could meet you all in person and give you a hug. Life is hard. People die, we go through depressions, self cutting and all those horrible things in life. We need hugs. I wish Im you were here to hug me. I am working on no longer cutting. Thank you for your message of hope and love. I wish you were here to give me a hug.  I love you.", "OP, please check if there a kid's grief groups in your area. It helps many kids to realise they are not alone in this. And if she wants, make sure she has a good picture of her mom in her room. Make sure she knows she can talk of her. And look that she gets enough mementos of her mother. Sometimes women have different thoughts about what they would like to have from their moms than men. Better keep a few things more than not enough (if possible). Good luck to all of you.", "Thank you for this update and for being such a good person.\nI am glad to read this and I am glad your step-daughter has you in your life \u2764!", "I just read your original post and this update.\n\nOh boy. That is heavy. I'm sorry for the loss everyone is feeling right now. I know it's tough. Despite your rocky relationship, I am sure it's a bit of a bittersweet realization for you.\n\nYour stepdaughter is going to be grieving and reacting in so many different ways. She will probably push you away. She needs some unconditional love right now. And maybe some therapy to help her with the grief.\n\nBest of luck to all of you.", "I think you handled the situation as well as possible.  G will always remember that you cared enough about her happiness to be willing to step aside if that's what she needed.  Ironically, by offering to leave, you created stability for her by respecting her feelings and showing you value her.\n\nI wish you and your family all the best in the future.", "> here\n\nThank you!", "Who cares that's not how it happened.", "Heart breaking story. I understand the Ex irrational anger. Imagine knowing you're dying, you're leaving your daughter to live with your ex husband and his new GF. You're constantly confronted with your own mortality in contrast to this woman and everything that she will experience that you will miss. It is easy to see the anger and jelousy come from this. \n\nYou can appreciate the childs responses, in the face of losing her mother at 10 year old. The anger, confusion hurt, when faced far to soon in life with the reality that the people your rely on, depend on and seem unconditionally present in your life, are mortal. \n\nThe BF who clearly, although not romantically, has a deep connection with the mother of his child. Who knows that she is dying, there is nothing anyone can do about it. He can see his child losing their mother, him losing a co parent and the ex wifes despair and anger at being taken so soon from this world. How do you tell someone off, even if they are being deeply nasty, when you have insight into the horror that their last days are becomming. \n\nFinally OP, who bless her absolute heart, slightly over reacted in the first instance out of understandable and justifyable pure hurt. Who found it within herself to put her BF, Step daughter, and BFs Exs needs above her own. Who finally decided, for better or for worse, that she was going to provide consistency and care for the child unconditionally. Who's only demand was that her BF stick up for her in the future and who is now, selflessly, continuing to raise a lost little girl who only wants her mother but cannot have her. \n\nThere are no real AH here in this tale only people trying their best to navigate an impossibly unfair situation.", "...and i'm crying...\n\nI'm rooting for you guys!", "I'm glad about everything in this except the daughter's horrible situation losing her mom and your engagement. That girl is going to need help, and I'm glad you guys are there for her...it's going to be tough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the engagement, I'm almost universally against people getting engaged during extremely emotional times. Him proposing on the spot during probably his most emotional moment in his life so far is normal, but you should have put it on hold until you'd moved a bit out of the situation. People make irrational decisions when they're hurting, and they're far more likely to make decisions that will affect their entire lives because it feels good in the moment. I'd **heavily** recommend getting some couples counseling for yourselves and counseling for the kiddo.", "Oh man. By offering to go as a way to respect her very valid feelings, you did SO MUCH for her. You demonstrated that you aren't trying to replace her mom. You validated her emotions. You reinforced that regardless of what she is saying to you, you love her and care about her and are willing to do what it takes to help her. \n\nThank you for this update. Things are going to be so hard, but I think less so because you're there. And I know that if mama was able to, she'd be thanking you as well.", "This relationship isn\u2019t going to last. He absolutely panick proposed to her.", "This is a beautiful ending to a tragic story. The kid is lucky to have you. You're gonna be an amazing step mom. You handled this entire situation with aplomb.", "Poor kiddo, that would suck so much to lose your mom like that.  Glad you all are able to work through things.", "How incredibly sad for all of you!\n\nit sounds like you got some good advice and the direction that you took really did bring you all closer together!\n\nMy condolences for the loss..  And Congratulations on your engagement.", "damn does anyone know where i can find the original post???", "*WHERE DID ALL THESE ONIONS COME FROM*", "Damn you really managed to make T dying all about yourself. That proposal came from grief. I really don't see any of this working out.", "Not to mention that it was brain cancer... which like memory loss illnesses affects a person's personality as they degrade and the disease progresses. I feel so bad for them that they may never know if those words were the disease or how she actually felt. Both are awful.", "I second this, and I\u2019d also like to recommend you look into something a little more alternative like art therapy if it\u2019s available and if she\u2019s maybe slower to open up.  I did art therapy as a kid when some rough stuff happened and it was immensely helpful, and I\u2019ve also known people who got a lot out of things like equine therapy.  Kids sometimes need a slightly different approach, it might take a little time to find what jives with her but it\u2019s worth it.", "Those are great suggestions! You are a very thoughtful person.", "This is beautifully put. The only AH here is the cancer.", "True ! Also, I heard that when kids feel abandoned (which is the case when a parent passes, even if the abandonment is involuntary), they tend to test the love of others by pushing them away\u2026", "In my opinion this doesn't really matter. The woman had weeks to live. The ex obviously didn't handle the situation with much grace, but I can't imagine how stressed she was. Leaving behind a young child is so incredibly tragic. And the husband is in such a horrible situation. Yeah they're not married anymore, but someone who he loves, the mother of his child, was dying in a horrible way. In theory yeah, he would have stuck up for, and the ex would have realized she was being shitty, and the whole thing would have gone better. But in reality, he was probably just trying to not make things worse for someone going through something completely awful. OP has shown a lot of kindness, and the situation is unlikely to present itself again. I just don't think she needs to worry about what ifs.", "This, they say it's very important to not make any life-changing decisions during a crisis.  It would have been best to wait longer until emotions were dealt with for him and his daughter....because in a way it seems your bf was really still emotionally 'married' to his ex if that makes sense.  So he needs time to grieve, as much as his daughter does, an engagement and wedding planning will simply just delay that process.", "NGL, I thought the same thing; desperate times and heightened emotions do not make effective decision making capability! But, I'm not sure how long they've actually been together? They live together and it might not have been the right way/time, but perhaps it would last? That they can get through all hardships together is huge; but I'd have a long engagement making sure to work through their grief and forming a new family structure foremost. Who knows... if OP is in a good place, I'm gonna send positivity and hope for the best.  She deserves it.", "OP came to ask for advice for themselves - this is the story told from their perspective, not them monopolizing the attention or playing the victim. If you think that's what is happening here, then I encourage you to read this over with some more empathy and understanding.", "True !! This is all so sad", "Because its obvious he only proposed to her because she's willing to be the doormat punching bag to his grieving family and OPs problem didn't actually get solved. When the daughter freaked out did he intervine like her promised? No he left her to get run out of her own house.", "This isn't an advice sub. It's a judgment sub. OP has centred themselves in a situation where they needed to back off, and acted like a woman dying of BRAIN CANCER is in her right mind where she says something too mean. If you want to give her asspats then do so, but don't act like your empathy and understanding is better than mine because I came to a different conclusion to you.", "OP clearly said she responded immediately without giving her BF a chance to intervene", "OP said she stepped in before he could. And that's when his daughter said don't leave her."]}
