Lots has happened in the meanwhile, so I'll try to keep it short.\n\nFirst. I sat my BF down for a chat as soon as I saw him again (which was the day following our discussion). He agreed that we needed to talk, and told me he was sorry for calling me an asshole, that that he had been so much in shock that he hardly even remembered the whole fight in the first place.\n\nI told him I could understand that, and told him I love him and wanted to be there for him and support him throughout this ordeal. I also added, though, that I would need him to be able to stick up for me in the future, even against his daughter, who would be grieving and in a lot of pain. I told him to think about it, and let me know, and also said that I would keep his daughter for as long as he needed me to independently from his answer.\n\nHe asked me to marry him on the spot (no ring or anything, but he was crying and it was very sweet), so now we're engaged and relatively happy.\n\nSecond. T passed away a week later. I followed your suggestion, and didn't see her again. G is living full time with us now, and I have what I think are if not good, hopeful news.\n\nTen days after her mother's death, she broke down in hysterics because she wanted her mom. It was an incredibly sad moment. She kept yelling insults at me and crying and again yelling at me.\n\nI was in tears, because seeing a child in that much pain is truly heart wrenching. So I intervened before my Fiancee could say anything, told G that I couldn't bear to see her so distressed and that I would go stay with a friend until she felt a bit better. That I loved her, and just wanted her to be less sad.\n\nShe ran to me, hugged me and begged me not to leave her. We cried together, and I think we might be on the road to healing.\n\nThat is to say, thank you Reddit folks for your feedback.

I understand the Ex irrational anger. Imagine knowing you're dying, you're leaving your daughter to live with your ex husband and his new GF. You're constantly confronted with your own mortality in contrast to this woman and everything that she will experience that you will miss. It is easy to see the anger and jelousy come from this. \n\nYou can appreciate the childs responses, in the face of losing her mother at 10 year old. The anger, confusion hurt, when faced far to soon in life with the reality that the people your rely on, depend on and seem unconditionally present in your life, are mortal. \n\nThe BF who clearly, although not romantically, has a deep connection with the mother of his child. Who knows that she is dying, there is nothing anyone can do about it. He can see his child losing their mother, him losing a co parent and the ex wifes despair and anger at being taken so soon from this world. How do you tell someone off, even if they are being deeply nasty, when you have insight into the horror that their last days are becomming. \n\nFinally OP, who bless her absolute heart, slightly over reacted in the first instance out of understandable and justifyable pure hurt. Who found it within herself to put her BF, Step daughter, and BFs Exs needs above her own. Who finally decided, for better or for worse, that she was going to provide consistency and care for the child unconditionally. Who's only demand was that her BF stick up for her in the future and who is now, selflessly, continuing to raise a lost little girl who only wants her mother but cannot have her. \n\nThere are no real AH here in this tale only people trying their best to navigate an impossibly unfair situation.", "...and i'm crying...\n\nI'm rooting for you guys!", "I'm glad about everything in this except the daughter's horrible situation losing her mom and your engagement. That girl is going to need help, and I'm glad you guys are there for her...it's going to be tough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the engagement, I'm almost universally against people getting engaged during extremely emotional times. Him proposing on the spot during probably his most emotional moment in his life so far is normal, but you should have put it on hold until you'd moved a bit out of the situation. People make irrational decisions when they're hurting, and they're far more likely to make decisions that will affect their entire lives because it feels good in the moment.

By offering to go as a way to respect her very valid feelings, you did SO MUCH for her. You demonstrated that you aren't trying to replace her mom. You validated her emotions.

Both are awful.", "I second this, and I\u2019d also like to recommend you look into something a little more alternative like art therapy if it\u2019s available and if she\u2019s maybe slower to open up.  I did art therapy as a kid when some rough stuff happened and it was immensely helpful, and I\u2019ve also known people who got a lot out of things like equine therapy.

The woman had weeks to live. The ex obviously didn't handle the situation with much grace, but I can't imagine how stressed she was. Leaving behind a young child is so incredibly tragic. And the husband is in such a horrible situation. Yeah they're not married anymore, but someone who he loves, the mother of his child, was dying in a horrible way. In theory yeah, he would have stuck up for, and the ex would have realized she was being shitty, and the whole thing would have gone better. But in reality, he was probably just trying to not make things worse for someone going through something completely awful. OP has shown a lot of kindness, and the situation is unlikely to present itself again. I just don't think she needs to worry about what ifs.", "This, they say it's very important to not make any life-changing decisions during a crisis.  It would have been best to wait longer until emotions were dealt with for him and his daughter....because in a way it seems your bf was really still emotionally 'married' to his ex if that makes sense.  So he needs time to grieve, as much as his daughter does, an engagement and wedding planning will simply just delay that process.", "NGL, I thought the same thing; desperate times and heightened emotions do not make effective decision making capability! But, I'm not sure how long they've actually been together? They live together and it might not have been the right way/time, but perhaps it would last? That they can get through all hardships together is huge; but I'd have a long engagement making sure to work through their grief and forming a new family structure foremost. Who knows... if OP is in a good place, I'm gonna send positivity and hope for the best.  She deserves it.", "OP came to ask for advice for themselves - this is the story told from their perspective, not them monopolizing the attention or playing the victim.

This is all so sad", "Because its obvious he only proposed to her because she's willing to be the doormat punching bag to his grieving family and OPs problem didn't actually get solved. When the daughter freaked out did he intervine like her promised? No he left her to get run out of her own house.", "This isn't an advice sub. It's a judgment sub.

Be very careful about assuming too much of a mother role. \n\nAnd I wouldn't rush into planning the wedding,  as that is a minefield in itself -especially if your BF's in-laws are in the picture. \n\nIn addition, the timing of your BF's  proposal could be indicative that he was worried that he might have blown it and that you might have been getting ready to dump him.

Bf has known his ex for most of his life. He grew up with her, had a kid with her, and yes, she cheated on him, but they got past that and were apparently good friends up until her death. It's a horribly traumatic situation he's found himself in, watching someone he's known for so long deteriorate so quickly. I never got the vibe he wants OP to be a \"doormat punching bag\" for his family - I get the feeling he was trapped between wanting to stick up for his fiance and being in shock at the things his ex was saying, because she wasn't like this up until around a month ago. Terminal brain cancer would change anyone's behavior.\n\nAlso, the daughter didn't \"freak out\". She's a **child** grieving for the mother she lost less than two weeks ago. I'm glad for you that you apparently have never been forced to deal with losing someone so close to you, but you should know it's not really something most adults handle well.

The second was the hope that the people around people with similar issues have armor plating  for what might happen in terms of behavior, and love in their hearts, and their own support team.  I luckily didn't have that kind of behavior or language change, but I volunteer with patients with brain cancers, and often have to comfort people struggling with what their loved one did or said.  The nurses and doctors always say what I just said -- that their human is now a different person in ways that are not subconscious thoughts popping out of hiding.  Their ways of processing data that are as alien to the patient as they are to their caregivers and visitors, and if they survive chemo with minimal scar tissues, they are horrified to learn what they did or said.  Peace.", ">So I intervened before my Fiancee could say anything, told G that I couldn't bear to see her so distressed and that I would go stay with a friend until she felt a bit better. That I loved her, and just wanted her to be less sad.\n\nThis in particular is beautiful. You made sure to let her know that you're not trying to be her mother, to take T's place. You just want her to feel a bit better, and if that means leaving for a short while, you were ready to do that. \n\nG likely knew from that moment that your focus was on her, not yourself.", "OP, you\u2019re off to an excellent start. I hope she has not only counseling, but grief counseling targeted to children who\u2019ve lost parents. Just about every community has one, and the hospital may be a resource. You\u2019ve wisely seen not to force anything. It will take a long while. The best thing you can continue to do is what you did - give her choices that respect her pain and grief. We\u2019ve all seen too many stories on this app where a woman comes in, demands to be \u201creplacement mom\u201d and alienates the child. \n\nThe other thing perhaps to remember is that children, especially teens, test their parents to see how far they can push, to see if they can actually do something bad enough to push them away. For bio parents in functional relationships, this is challenging. The dynamic is trickier with blended families. If you keep coming back with love, you stand to outlast the waves of pain that will echo for the rest of her life. She will miss her mother at major milestones. Something like a wedding or graduation could cause her to lash out, and even she might not know why. \n\nIt may also help to hold space for the possibility of never *being* mom or stepmom, but dad\u2019s wife. But in that role, perhaps akin to a great MIL, you can augment her life with a supportive presence. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to treat you like trash, and your future husband should support you if she\u2019s destructive, cruel, etc. \n\nYou have an enviable task, but I know many step parents who became the \u201cmom/dad they didn\u2019t have to be\u201d (to quote the country song.) \n\nBest wishes to you all.", "I'm so sorry for this whole situation, I'm sorry G has to go through so much so young. Therapy will hopefully help you all form bonds through this loss. Keep doing what you're doing and support G through this with compassion, empathy and love. Your response was really great to show her how much you care, and also how much it hurt you as well. She will have so much more pain to go through and she'll learn down the road that the last thing she really wanted was to push you away.", "For your step daughter suggest school counseling and grief counseling and try family counseling, the last thing this girl needs is to lose another person in her life she has abandonment issues now, so proud of you for handling this situation so well", "Bless you for being there for your fiancee's daughter.

She got NASTY at the end. =/", "Reminds me of a post on BoRU not too long ago about a wife having new, surprising issues with her husband. Turns out he had a benign brain tumor that turned out to  not only be the basis of his behavior change, but also essentially the foundation of their whole relationship. After they took out the tumor, he was kinder again, but he wasn\u2019t in love with her anymore and they divorced. \n\nMakes me wonder how much of T\u2019s behavior leading up to the divorce was influenced by the tumor.", ">  T could\u2019ve had a tumor affecting her personality for years before her diagnosis.\n\nNot necessarily, some forms grow really, really quickly. My mother died of brain cancer, the surgeons who removed the tumor a few days after it was found said that it would have been there for less than a year, despite being something like 6cm x 3.5cm (it's been a long time, I can't recall the exact size). It was 8 months from diagnosis to death due to how aggressive it was, we only noticed the behavioural changes for maybe 2-3 months before they found it. It looks to me like T had a similarly short time after her diagnosis too.", "Glioblastomas grow super freaking fast though. If she had an aggressive glioblastoma it can double in size every week. One of my friends got diagnosed in December and was gone in March. It was pretty small when they found it, just inoperable due to where it was.  \n\n\nAll cancer sucks, but brain cancer is one of the suckiest ones.", "TBI can cause the same.

I never knew that a tumor could do that, which kind of makes me terrified of brain tumors slightly more than I was.", "Can you link that post?", "Our petsitter that we adore had been having what we thought was mental health issues. Everyone has been super supportive of her taking a break from school and work. But turns out she actually has a brain tumor when it was originally diagnosed as bipolar and borderline. As someone else with bipolar, I found it especially terrifying. Like there\u2019s no blood test or scan for most mental illnesses, how can you truly ever know?", "Man. It can get wild. I've been on a few meds that talk about looking out for mood changes. Stuff you wouldn't think would actually be the med itself. Like. I get that with psych meds and hormone shit. But it's always been a concern for a few immune suppressants too and I always chalked it up to \"they have to list everything that's ever been reported\" and naturally people with major diagnosis might have some depression and mood issues related to finding out, or general irritability due to other side effects, you know? But I've been on various immune suppressants my whole damn life. Recently got put on cellcept again (I'd been on it as a kid) and omg was I a raging bitch. Just. Pissed. And depressed. All. The. Time. My mom had to sit down and have a talk with grown ass 33 year old me about it. So they put me on a new version of the same damn drug (yaaay enteric coatings for patent renewals) and it was like a light switched off.\n\nIf even immune suppresants can do that... I do t even want to imagine what brain tumors can do", "Yeah, that post was heartbreaking.", "Congratulations!!!", "These situations are so difficult to navigate, but obviously you're figuring it out as best as you can, and both your fiance (congratulations!!) and your new step-daughter (feels weird saying that, and I mean no harm regardless) have both had beautiful breakthroughs with you and I wish your family an abundance of healing and happiness together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEditing to add after thinking on it- I know things with T were difficult and stressful as well. As the child of a parent who passed when I was young, try your best to put T's behavior to the side for the sake of G. What's done is done, and G will grow up with such an immense respect for you (especially when she becomes an adult and possibly privy to her mom's actions), as well as a firm knowing that you're a safe person to her. Try to hold her in the highest regard as a parent to G rather than an angry ex of your soon-to-be husband.", "That's beautiful.", "Oh my god, that's heartbreaking.
