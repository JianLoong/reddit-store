Lots has happened in the meanwhile, so I'll try to keep it short.\n\nFirst. I sat my BF down for a chat as soon as I saw him again (which was the day following our discussion). He agreed that we needed to talk, and told me he was sorry for calling me an asshole, that that he had been so much in shock that he hardly even remembered the whole fight in the first place.\n\nI told him I could understand that, and told him I love him and wanted to be there for him and support him throughout this ordeal. I also added, though, that I would need him to be able to stick up for me in the future, even against his daughter, who would be grieving and in a lot of pain. I told him to think about it, and let me know, and also said that I would keep his daughter for as long as he needed me to independently from his answer.\n\nHe asked me to marry him on the spot (no ring or anything, but he was crying and it was very sweet), so now we're engaged and relatively happy.\n\nSecond. T passed away a week later. I followed your suggestion, and didn't see her again. G is living full time with us now, and I have what I think are if not good, hopeful news.\n\nTen days after her mother's death, she broke down in hysterics because she wanted her mom. It was an incredibly sad moment. She kept yelling insults at me and crying and again yelling at me.\n\nI was in tears, because seeing a child in that much pain is truly heart wrenching. So I intervened before my Fiancee could say anything, told G that I couldn't bear to see her so distressed and that I would go stay with a friend until she felt a bit better. That I loved her, and just wanted her to be less sad.\n\nShe ran to me, hugged me and begged me not to leave her. We cried together, and I think we might be on the road to healing.\n\nThat is to say, thank you Reddit folks for your feedback. You're awesome.", "created_utc": 1677232874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11anu3g/update_wibta_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_bfs/", "score": 62, "replies": ["So happy to read the last paragraph of your update. It's incredibly sad for all of you, and after what T put you through (eventhough she must have been very distressed to be dying, leaving such a young kid without a mother), you're incredibly strong and good to the core to still handle it the way you are. \n\nI hope you manage to build a strong relationship with G and have a happy mariage.", "Original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10elpe1/wibta_for_refusing_to_babysit_my_bfs_daughter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Question- when you said his decision to stick up for you or not wouldn't affect your decision to watch her, I dunno what I'm trying to say... what would you have done if he didn't stick up for you?
