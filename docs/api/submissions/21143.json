I agreed and said that he was awesome and that we all picked different but very challenging fields. Nursing school can be as tough as med school sometimes.\n\nJuliette smiled and said 'sure' in a dismissive way. I confronted her and asked her what she meant. She said med school and the career path of becoming a physician is way more challenging than being a nurse. \n\nI felt a little insulted and told her about a nurse's duties and how important they were. Juliette laughed (again, a laugh like I'm an idiot and have no idea what I'm talking about) and said she knows it is important but it is not as challenging as med school. She also said there's a reason they call for the doctor when things het out of hand. Even Emily said that everything has its unique challenges for each person and tried to change the subject.\n\nJuliette didn't stop and said if you want to know how challenging med school is you should try to get in one. She said it only gets harder thereafter, with all the responsibility, but even at the very beginning more people fail than succeed. \n\nI told her the world doesn't revolve around her and that she needed to get a hold of her ego and appreciate others. She just laughed a little bit more and ignored my frustration. Only commented I would only understand if I'd taken the same path. She let go of the topic then. My mom later said I was being childish and is not happy with how the dinner went down. As always, she supports Jueliette. Mark supports me.\n\nI still haven't talkes to them after the event.

One is clearly more labour intensive.

Are you sure that\u2019s the case and you\u2019re not just interpreting it that way?

Your comment that \u201cnursing school can be as tough as medical school sometimes\u201d seems intended to provoke your sister.", "YTA. While nurses and doctors are both equally important in the medical field as both are needed for good patient outcomes, Juliette is correct that \u201cthe career path of becoming a physician is way more challenging than becoming a nurse\u201d. Nurses do either 2 years of an associate\u2019s degree and then 1-2 years of becoming a RN. She would have done 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, and then 4 years of a neurology residency meaning it took her 12 years post high school to officially be done training while yours took 3-6 at the most. That\u2019s not saying that becoming a nurse is easy, or that the schooling isn\u2019t hard. You should be proud of your accomplishment. But her point was about the entire path, of which hers was longer and harder. Especially for neurology! Don\u2019t diminish her accomplishment. Your comments about her and how your mom \u201calways\u201d supports her reeks of jealousy of her.

You're the one that open the can of worms and then confront Juliette on her \"sure\" reply.  \n\nBoth professions are important but to say that getting a degree to be an RN can be as tough as getting a degree to be a doctor, a neurologist no less is simply untrue. You're trying to make yourself looks better. You should have stopped at \"I agree\" on Mark's comment.", "YTA  \nYou made the comparison. You goaded your sister into a fight.   \nWhilst you should be proud of your accomplishments, doing an undergrad to become a nurse isn't remotely as difficult as med school. That's a delusional take.

At some point you need to realise that your sister is an A through and through and need to go low contact and let incidents like this dinner go", "Based on personal experience, your sister is correct.

If you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re in complete denial.", "I\u2019m an APRN (CRNA) with many nurse and MD friends of varying specialties. It\u2019s utterly delusional to think that a two or four year nursing education is somehow more difficult than med school. In the field of nursing, there are many tasks we do that are harder than what *some* MDs do in terms of personal bodily harm, gross factor and impossible time management. But in terms of plain educational rigor, nursing school is a *cakewalk* compared to med school, you know it and you\u2019re being defensive, and the comment was specifically designed to rile your sister so you could play the victim. \n\nYTA and stop making nurses look like whiny babies.", "YTA. You made your initial comment\u2014\u201cnursing school can be as tough as med school sometimes\u201d\u2014to get a reaction from your sister.

That wasn\u2019t a good look. Second: from what little you\u2019ve shared, your relationship with your sister sounds like it\u2019s been challenging for a very long time. God knows the Venn diagram of physicians and assholes can sometimes just be a circle (to say nothing of the graphical relationship between neurologists and assholes). Your frustration and need for validation both totally make sense. But (!!!) though there are arguments to be had about the challenges of specific aspects of each education, by many, many metrics, your schooling *wasn\u2019t* as challenging as ours. \n\nAlso, you did this at YOUR party! Why would you throw *your own party* under the bus to get in a potshot that never had a hope of landing? It sounds like you had something to prove instead of something to share. Was it worth it?\n\nETA: Also, why are you beefing with her wife and kid? That baby is 2, and her wife attempted a graceful and gentle redirect to save both you and your sister\u2019s dignity. They seem like decent folk.", "YTA. You comment is so insecure.", "YTA. Most specifically for your initial comment that started the whole thing. As an adult you should really learn that subjective and objective are completely different arguments and other adults don't have to entertain your lack of understanding.\n\nSubjectively maybe getting your nursing degree was very hard and challenging for you and that's in no way belittling your accomplishments. We need good nurses just like we need good doctors. Objectively though, the two career paths are not comparable in terms of the difficulty level to attain.", "YTA. While your sister is a definitive 'A', you are no less. And no you cannot compare Nursing School and Medical School OP. I don't know how it works in the US as opposed to the other countries but it definitely looks like your sister has invested more years in here education. You went looking for a way to put her down but rather unfortunately fell in your own ditch.", "YTA. Nursing school is in a completely different league when compared to med school. Nothing wrong with being a nurse. It's a very important job. But that doesn't make it compare to med school. Good grief.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re the one who made the comparison.

You\u2019re the one who invited the elaboration.\n\nJuliette should have backed off at that point too, opting not to fight this particular battle at your graduation party.", "Pretty sure this is a repost.", "ESH. You're clearly holding grudges against your sister, and it seems like you have your reasons, so you've tossed that truly unnecessary comment knowing how your sister would react and not subtly at all picking a fight. Why couldn't you just be happy for your achievement and the lovely compliment from your brother and leave your sister be? I'm sure there's a lot about your family dynamics that would explain all this resentment boiling underneath, and I would suggest therapy for you, lest you keep ruining your future milestones and celebrations.", "ESH.

Something that's not a challenge to me within my job might be for my colleague and vise-versa. But comparing two different jobs (even in the same field) without having done the work of both of those jobs is never going to be an unbiased opinion. \r  \n\r  \nI feel like your comment was unnecessary, because while nursing school isn\u2019t easy compared to other programs, comparing it to becoming a doctor is not entirely apt either. \r  \n\r  \nI do think your sister overreacted, but I also don\u2019t think it was necessarily about you. If she\u2019s the type of person who wants to be the most important, she might feel like you are encroaching on her space and her sense of belonging in the world, which is making her defensive. \r  \n\r  \nAnd I don\u2019t think it helps that she\u2019s a woman in a field where she\u2019s probably had to justify and fight for her space.

Even if she knows that nurses are an important backbone of any medical facility, and do amazing work, it isn\u2019t the same as being a doctor. Both are important and difficult, rewarding and heartbreaking, but it\u2019s not the same. \r  \n\r  \nI kind of feel like you both overreacted because you were both feeling some kinds of unresolved emotions about the whole thing and your sibling relationship in general.

The scope of practice and responsibilities of a physician is far more expansive than a nurse. I can see why your sister would be offended by that comparison.

I worked as an RN and don\u2019t ever want to have to make so many of the life and death calls they do, be the person to break the news of a cancer diagnosis, bring up end of life care to a patient in denial, be the on-call MD for 205 patients, etc; it\u2019s a responsibility I couldn\u2019t handle.\n\nBeing a nurse was hard as shit, but so is being a doctor.", "Yeah, I remember that one too.  If someone pointed to wasp nest and said I have a phobia about them--I would have assumed of wasps(not dots/spots/holes).\n\nHowever, socks as a gift?  I gotta say all the people loving on socks surprised me.  I'd rather NOT have someone else pick out my socks: color/size/type(ie crew cut etc).  But I feel that way about all clothes(had sibling who got me clothes frequently that I HATED.  Mauve-yuck, weird almost spots? -no phobia--just ugly).", "Its easier to just point to supply/demand. \n\nYou have 10 nurses/techs/janitors/admins for every 1 doctor. They will make more accordingly. \n\nThey have more *value*", "Question: Do you work in a hospital?", "Which is worsened by limiting additional schools as increased number of programs can bring down wages.", "Right. But the point is more people are capable of doing the housekeeping work than are capable of doing neurosurgery. Not that hard to understand", "Isn\u2019t that the truth!! Ours started last week! Although I tell my pts it\u2019s one more set of eyes on them which is a good thing.", "Doctors can\u2019t do their jobs without other professions. Most can\u2019t even put in an IV, nevermind do neurosurgery by themselves", "Well what do you mean by difficulty? Overall difficulty? Academic difficulty? Physical difficulty? \n\nAcademically med school is by far the harder one. The sheer amount of stuff you have to memorize is insane.\n\nPhysically though I've heard nursing school is harder. \n\nOverall difficulty depends on the person. If they've got a brain that can memorize easily then med school won't be as hard for them. If you can't memorize but can do the physical aspect then nursing will be easier.", "And how on earth would it be physically more taxing especially when mes school requires more years of your life of full dedication?", "YTA. Juliette tried to let it go. She said sure. You outright provoked your sister. And med school is 100% harder than nursing school. Nurses are so very important, but that does not make nursing school as hard as med school. \n\nGet off your high horse", "NTA. Your sister is wrong. I am an anesthesiologist and I teach nurse anesthesia students. Both nursing and medicine are difficult in their own way. They just teach different things and if your sister was honest, she would admit how much she learned from nurses during her medical training. I don't mean to take anything away from her, Med school and residency are hard but to belittle your accomplishments is mean spirited. Ignore her and your Mom. Live your best life. Congratulations!", "Sounds like this scenario is typical of your family dynamic. Everyone using old crappy habits and it needs to stop. You for making a comment you know your sister will respond negatively to, your sister for being a snob and then some, your mom and brother for taking sides. Counseling can help but be prepared to acknowledge your role, even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s your fault. Old family habits have deep roots. One more thing: make an effort to be happy for each of your family member\u2019s victories. If you think of the family as a team, rather than rivals, you may enjoy them much more.", "It\u2019s very clear that you have a disdain for your sister that\u2019s why you started that fight at the dinner at your sister \u201c sure\u201d reply should have ignored it  your mom was right YTA", ">Mom thinks I was an AH for the initial comment after Mark's praise. Am I?  \n\n\nyes YTA, you started the argument with your comment.   \n\n\n>I agreed and said that he was awesome and that we all picked different but very challenging fields.\n\nif you stopped after this comment all would have been good, you created a problem from nothing.\n\nI have the greatest respect for nurses and know that their job is really challenging, however Nurse school is not more challenging than Med school.  A person needs way more qualifications for med school and the course is much more intense. It sounds like you have unresolved jealousy problems of your sister.", "Yta why did you even bring it up????", "And it is objectively incorrect.", "It was just what I felt at the moment. She would take any opportunity to point out how exceptionally wonderful she is. No need for provocation.", "See, I figured Juliette laughed because her sister, the new grad nurse, was unironically explaining to the *practicing physician* what nurses do.", "Go ahead and try to run a hospital without nursing. Or housekeeping, or nutrition, or engineering. I could go on. \n\nWe are indeed all equally important. Playing the game of \u201cwho is the most important\u201d is really stupid.", "So she should not be proud of herself? You are coming across jealous \n\nAlso medical school is soo much harder than nursing school. The requirements to get into Med school vs nursing are not even close to being the same. Nursing schools are not hard to get into. I have friends that had to get masters degrees to even be considered for Med school, while having amazing grades in undergrad and doing well on the MCAT.", "Grow up, girl.", "I\u2019m still waiting for OP to chime in (past the initial post) because I am so curious what the logic was for saying something like that. Hand to god, I truly want to understand what she hoped to achieve. Also, from the disparity in demeanors (as described by OP) between Juliette and herself, I almost wonder if Juliette even knows an enmity this deep exists between them. I don\u2019t doubt she would also say their relationship is strained, but I wonder if she feels it as acutely as OP.", "Ahhhh, now I feel stupid. That's a far more insightful reason. Thanks!", "That's what I was thinking. Not saying other people and positions aren't important - but not everything is equal especially in a business/healthcare setting.", "I\u2019m I nurse. No way nursing school is as hard as med school.", "I would think Juliette has literally been too busy living her life.  Becoming a neurosurgeon, getting married, having a child.\n\nI am curious what planet Juliette supposedly thinks Emily is from(per OP's comment) LOL", "They are not support roles for doctors. \n\nWe are all support roles for patients.", "Your hierarchy model is just wrong, although it\u2019s commonly held by members of the public. \nPeople defer to housekeepers when the issue is how to ensure a clean environment. We defer to engineering when we are working to maintain safe temperature and humidity. We defer to pharmacy around med interactions and many many other issues. \n\nEveryone manages their own specialty. Everyone has their scope. A hospital is not a hierarchy with doctors at the top. Lol.", "Proportionally it is. At the school I worked at, there were 150 prenursimg majors competing for 10-12 spots. 28 spots were direct admit. Not all would apply, some decided it was too risky to keep this path and still graduate in 4 years. Others would change to the community college, but that was a different competition Pool. They had the seats for 48, but faculty and clinical placement shortages cut that number. So, I would call that competitive.", "That would be 150-190 applicants for 38 spots. If your quiz bowl team had this kind of numbers, that is impressive.", "Quite frankly after 5 months I expect nothing (and generally gave nothing). I'm still getting to know someone. If someone's expecting the same value gift from someone who held me as a baby, then that's great because I don't need to waste another month. \n\nMy partner gets socks sometimes, she seems to love them. Though finding a good pair of socks that doesn't wear out quick is *hard*. Considering how quickly the wasp nests appear in most of them, is probably why she likes socks, but its not on birthdays and they aren't those awful comedy socks (or polkadots).\n\nI agree on the clothes thing. I prefer to just buy her something whenever she's shopping for clothing/shoes.  That way she can pick it. I wouldn't really like her buying me clothes, because I'd wear it even if I didn't like it.", "Right? And also, why edit the original post to add that part in??", "No - but I def understand how a hospital operates. I also don't work in a restaurant - but i know the head chef is more important than the waiter - even though restaurants can't function without waiters. \n\nThe movie star is the star of the movie - the supporting cast is very important - but the star is the top. This is how I think of it with doctors. They are the star - nurses and staff are the supporting cast. People definitely choose their doctors and specialists - they are not choosing their nursing staff.", "I mean, more like 25 applicants for 4 spots. So actually more competitive...", ">sometimes it's compatable. Like they both take anatomy classes which is difficult.\n\nRest assured that the anatomy classes for med school are far more difficult and in-depth than the anatomy classes for nursing.", "People on this site refuse to accept concepts like supply and demand when it comes to jobs. I wonder why the accountant that manages the finance department gets paid more than the burger flipper", "You're literally saying one is more expendable than the other, so they're worth as people are implied there.", "Congradulations! You've discovered division of labour", "CEOs can\u2019t do their jobs without other professions. They still sit atop the hierarchy of scarcity and pay in the business world.", "People on this site understand the value of people and humility. The best doctors are the ones who recognize the importance of the nurses and staff. And I've known many who will ask the nurse what meds she wants ordered to deescalate a patient because nurses know the patients better. While I wouldn't want a housekeeper to do surgery on me, I wouldn't want a surgeon to clean my hospital room.", "If you're going off of total years then yea it's not as bad but that's kinda skewed since med school is so much longer. But the length of time for nursing compared to that same amount of med school is what I'm talking about.\n\nBut that doesn't really matter. Just because one thing may or may not be harder doesn't diminish the fact that they're both hard"]}
