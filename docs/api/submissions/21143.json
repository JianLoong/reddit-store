I agreed and said that he was awesome and that we all picked different but very challenging fields. Nursing school can be as tough as med school sometimes.\n\nJuliette smiled and said 'sure' in a dismissive way. I confronted her and asked her what she meant. She said med school and the career path of becoming a physician is way more challenging than being a nurse. \n\nI felt a little insulted and told her about a nurse's duties and how important they were. Juliette laughed (again, a laugh like I'm an idiot and have no idea what I'm talking about) and said she knows it is important but it is not as challenging as med school. She also said there's a reason they call for the doctor when things het out of hand. Even Emily said that everything has its unique challenges for each person and tried to change the subject.\n\nJuliette didn't stop and said if you want to know how challenging med school is you should try to get in one. She said it only gets harder thereafter, with all the responsibility, but even at the very beginning more people fail than succeed. \n\nI told her the world doesn't revolve around her and that she needed to get a hold of her ego and appreciate others. She just laughed a little bit more and ignored my frustration. Only commented I would only understand if I'd taken the same path. She let go of the topic then. My mom later said I was being childish and is not happy with how the dinner went down. As always, she supports Jueliette. Mark supports me.\n\nI still haven't talkes to them after the event.

One is clearly more labour intensive.

Are you sure that\u2019s the case and you\u2019re not just interpreting it that way?

Your comment that \u201cnursing school can be as tough as medical school sometimes\u201d seems intended to provoke your sister.", "YTA. While nurses and doctors are both equally important in the medical field as both are needed for good patient outcomes, Juliette is correct that \u201cthe career path of becoming a physician is way more challenging than becoming a nurse\u201d. Nurses do either 2 years of an associate\u2019s degree and then 1-2 years of becoming a RN. She would have done 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, and then 4 years of a neurology residency meaning it took her 12 years post high school to officially be done training while yours took 3-6 at the most. That\u2019s not saying that becoming a nurse is easy, or that the schooling isn\u2019t hard. You should be proud of your accomplishment. But her point was about the entire path, of which hers was longer and harder. Especially for neurology! Don\u2019t diminish her accomplishment. Your comments about her and how your mom \u201calways\u201d supports her reeks of jealousy of her.

You're the one that open the can of worms and then confront Juliette on her \"sure\" reply.  \n\nBoth professions are important but to say that getting a degree to be an RN can be as tough as getting a degree to be a doctor, a neurologist no less is simply untrue. You're trying to make yourself looks better. You should have stopped at \"I agree\" on Mark's comment.", "YTA  \nYou made the comparison. You goaded your sister into a fight.   \nWhilst you should be proud of your accomplishments, doing an undergrad to become a nurse isn't remotely as difficult as med school. That's a delusional take.

At some point you need to realise that your sister is an A through and through and need to go low contact and let incidents like this dinner go", "Based on personal experience, your sister is correct. Med schools are extremity difficult and challenging.", "YTA - medical school is significantly harder than nursing school. If you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re in complete denial.", "I\u2019m an APRN (CRNA) with many nurse and MD friends of varying specialties. It\u2019s utterly delusional to think that a two or four year nursing education is somehow more difficult than med school. In the field of nursing, there are many tasks we do that are harder than what *some* MDs do in terms of personal bodily harm, gross factor and impossible time management. But in terms of plain educational rigor, nursing school is a *cakewalk* compared to med school, you know it and you\u2019re being defensive, and the comment was specifically designed to rile your sister so you could play the victim. \n\nYTA and stop making nurses look like whiny babies.", "YTA. You made your initial comment\u2014\u201cnursing school can be as tough as med school sometimes\u201d\u2014to get a reaction from your sister.

That wasn\u2019t a good look. Second: from what little you\u2019ve shared, your relationship with your sister sounds like it\u2019s been challenging for a very long time. God knows the Venn diagram of physicians and assholes can sometimes just be a circle (to say nothing of the graphical relationship between neurologists and assholes). Your frustration and need for validation both totally make sense. But (!!!) though there are arguments to be had about the challenges of specific aspects of each education, by many, many metrics, your schooling *wasn\u2019t* as challenging as ours. \n\nAlso, you did this at YOUR party! Why would you throw *your own party* under the bus to get in a potshot that never had a hope of landing? It sounds like you had something to prove instead of something to share. Was it worth it?\n\nETA: Also, why are you beefing with her wife and kid? That baby is 2, and her wife attempted a graceful and gentle redirect to save both you and your sister\u2019s dignity. They seem like decent folk.", "YTA. You comment is so insecure.", "YTA. Most specifically for your initial comment that started the whole thing. As an adult you should really learn that subjective and objective are completely different arguments and other adults don't have to entertain your lack of understanding.\n\nSubjectively maybe getting your nursing degree was very hard and challenging for you and that's in no way belittling your accomplishments. We need good nurses just like we need good doctors. Objectively though, the two career paths are not comparable in terms of the difficulty level to attain.", "YTA. While your sister is a definitive 'A', you are no less. And no you cannot compare Nursing School and Medical School OP. I don't know how it works in the US as opposed to the other countries but it definitely looks like your sister has invested more years in here education. You went looking for a way to put her down but rather unfortunately fell in your own ditch.", "YTA. Nursing school is in a completely different league when compared to med school. Nothing wrong with being a nurse. It's a very important job. But that doesn't make it compare to med school. Good grief.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re the one who made the comparison.

You\u2019re the one who invited the elaboration.\n\nJuliette should have backed off at that point too, opting not to fight this particular battle at your graduation party.", "Pretty sure this is a repost.", "ESH. You're clearly holding grudges against your sister, and it seems like you have your reasons, so you've tossed that truly unnecessary comment knowing how your sister would react and not subtly at all picking a fight. Why couldn't you just be happy for your achievement and the lovely compliment from your brother and leave your sister be? I'm sure there's a lot about your family dynamics that would explain all this resentment boiling underneath, and I would suggest therapy for you, lest you keep ruining your future milestones and celebrations.", "ESH.

Sorry but med school IS more challenging than nursing and the stakes for getting stuff wrong is a lot higher.\n\nNTA for feeling bad, nursing is a challenge and nurses are indispensable, and worth a lot, and she insulted you and was dismissive. But it's not being a doctor (where training carries on for years after the degree itself more so than nursing does).", "ESH. \r  \nEvery job has it's challenges, not just in the job itself but because everyone doing that job is different. Something that's not a challenge to me within my job might be for my colleague and vise-versa. But comparing two different jobs (even in the same field) without having done the work of both of those jobs is never going to be an unbiased opinion. \r  \n\r  \nI feel like your comment was unnecessary, because while nursing school isn\u2019t easy compared to other programs, comparing it to becoming a doctor is not entirely apt either. \r  \n\r  \nI do think your sister overreacted, but I also don\u2019t think it was necessarily about you. If she\u2019s the type of person who wants to be the most important, she might feel like you are encroaching on her space and her sense of belonging in the world, which is making her defensive. \r  \n\r  \nAnd I don\u2019t think it helps that she\u2019s a woman in a field where she\u2019s probably had to justify and fight for her space.

Even if she knows that nurses are an important backbone of any medical facility, and do amazing work, it isn\u2019t the same as being a doctor. Both are important and difficult, rewarding and heartbreaking, but it\u2019s not the same. \r  \n\r  \nI kind of feel like you both overreacted because you were both feeling some kinds of unresolved emotions about the whole thing and your sibling relationship in general.

The scope of practice and responsibilities of a physician is far more expansive than a nurse. I can see why your sister would be offended by that comparison.

That you need this particular kind of recognition and nothing else would work for you. \n\nI think it would be the best for you to just do your own thing.

I have to wonder if it\u2019s actually OP who had the chip on her shoulder - feeling like her older sister did something more impressive. Because I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d express that specific comparison unless you were trying to preemptively challenge the suggestion.", "OP started the argument by saying nursing school and med school are equally difficult/challenging. It could have all been avoided if OP had simply agreed with her brother. You can't blame the sister for reacting to OP's comment. Sure she could have been nicer about it or let it slide during the graduation dinner but I don't think the sister would have compared them without OP starting it.", "Nurses cant take \"far better care\" than doctors because they dont do the same thing....", "While I agree nursing makes more sense in that they can make a lot more money with a lot less schooling, especially if they do travel nursing, doctors aren\u2019t going anywhere with AI. You forgot about all the surgical specialties which even many of the internal medicine ones have started doing many more procedures than in the past generations. Also, people see NPs or PAs usually in clinics. RNs aren\u2019t as common in clinics. NPs have more training than RNs. And even they will refer to the doctors when things are too complicated or out of their scope.", "Her sister is a neurologist, not a surgeon.", "Importance does not equal salary in the USA.", "In this case, I think \"equally important\" means if you removed one of these roles from the system, the system would collapse. The doctors would not be able to function without the nurses. They aren\u2019t paid more because they're more important, but because they are more qualified, less available, and have to take accountability for more.", "I don't think there's much relationship between pay and the importance of work.", "Hard HARD disagree. We all have different education levels and responsibilities/liabilities which is why we all have different levels of pay. but we are all important & necessary for good patient outcomes. In simplified terms: The doctors are necessary for analyzing situations & providing orders to promote healing. Without them there is no direction. The nurses are typically the ones actually carrying out the orders. Without them there is no consistent care. The health care aides are there for repositioning, cleaning, and feeding the patients which are all required for good outcomes. Without them there are complications for healing. Physiotherapists help mobilize & rehabilitate patients. Without them there is no way out of the bed & back into the home. The dieticians are there to analyze patient intake, vitamins, minerals, and weight management. Without them patients may become malnourished. Lab techs are there to analyze blood & body fluid work ups. Without them there are no test results. Orderlies transport patients to & from tests, scans, and appointments. Without them care is disjointed & overall patient picture is reduced & minimized. \n\nWe need the doctors to perform our duties, but the doctors need all other cogs in the health care system to be in place for their orders & objectives to come to fruition. Every person in the health care system works hard at their job & are needed to provide care. Your comment shows your ignorance on how healthcare operates. Every doctor I work with agrees that every person and profession within the hospital is necessary & important for care to be given. & the doctors who believe they are above other staff are the ones who don\u2019t listen to patients, think they know better than everyone (including the patient who\u2019s lived in their body their whole lives) and in almost every case, the patient suffers under their care.\n\nETA: there are many other professions in health care that I have not touched on but that doesn\u2019t make them less important! Those are just the ones I came up with off the top of my head", "It\u2019s not exactly clear if she even said that out loud or if it was her pointing it out to us by how it\u2019s written. Either way, she never said medical school isn\u2019t hard. She said sometimes nursing school can be as hard as med school, which makes sense because some courses overlap. If the sister got offended it\u2019s because she can\u2019t be compared to a \u201clowly nurse\u201d which is just her huge ego.", "Having worked as an advisor in a nursing school, there are at least 3-5 applicants for every spot in a nursing program, it is not easy to get into.", "You are entitled to your opinion Ofcourse but I disagree. some nurses do take far better care than some doctors. I spent several years from my twenties in various Oncology departments, nurses knew everyone by name with their full details and kept a loving (yet tough) eye on all patients who were there for chemo (it takes several hours), while doctors would pass by for rounds and spend max 2-3 mins per patient. So no a nurse is no less than a doctor , nor vice Versa. My reply was for the condescending treatment of OPs sibling which many doctors do.", "Oh I didnt mean to suggest all doctors. Certianly not surgeons. GPs though? Less certain.", "What do you think determines salary?  Pretty sure it's importance of the job and training needed to get said job.", "That makes them more important. The other jobs support them. They're the top. That's reality. Don't make other jobs insignificant - but in context they are support roles for the doctors", "Of course there is. A doctor is more important in a place where people are going for gealthcare - they get paid the most bc they have the most training and society has deemed this as an extremely important job. A janitor is important - but in the context of a hospital - it all revolves around the doctors. Everyone else is there to assist them in the patient care process - but they are the top of the hierarchy.", "As a doc, I agree with you fully! Everyone has their role, and they are all needed for good pt care.", "Yes. Exactly. There are different levels of everything and they may all function together and be necessary - but no one is going to a specific nurse or housekeeper. It's def a hierarchy.\n\n\"Every person in the healthcare system works hard at their job\" - who's being naive, Kay.\n\nNext you say how every doctor agrees point x - but the ones that don't agree have worst patient outcomes. You are contradicting yourself and overgeneralizing in a huge way. \n\nDoctor is def more important. They have more training, get paid more, and are the top of the hierarchy. Doesn't mean that the other jobs are not important - but that's just reality. People aren't deferring medical decisions to housekeepers.", "Or because the sister worked 8 extra years for her achievement and now her sister is trying to minimize that by saying her field of study is just as hard- which it factually is not. No need for that comment. No one likes their achievements and hard work to be minimized", "I think you missed the point. They didn\u2019t say nurses are less than a doctor. They literally just have different jobs.", "I could see some scope of GPs could definitely change, we saw that with telemedicine. But cysts will still need to have I and Ds, skin biopsies will still be needed, etc. Things that require a person. So I see it more changing in remote areas or with limited providers with telemedicine instead of AI decreasing the number.", "When I was going through cancer treatment, I saw my doctor for 5 minutes a month. I spent hours with the nurses, CNAs, therapists, and counselors.  I respected my doctor, but everyone else was infinitely more important to my care than my doctor. \n\nThe nurses and CNAs keep the patients alive in a hospital - I would never say that the education involved is the same, but they are more important to day to day patient care.", "Ya the sister worked hard no one is denying that. Nursing is also hard, she never said it was as hard as medical school alll the time but sometimes it\u2019s comparable. Like they both take anatomy classes which is difficult.", "Fair enough. I might be completely wrong lol", "I can accept that."]}
