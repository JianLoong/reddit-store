Let's call him \"Snotty\" for this thread (my son's idea, not his actual name).\n\nBackstory: My cousin Stella (42) lives on a large property and has wanted to build a catio for her pets for awhile. She had to wait, however, because she was worried about Snotty and a couple of other strays harassing them. Literally climbing onto the backyard porch and hissing them from the glass doors.\n\nShe reported them as nuisance animals to Animal Control and was advised to set traps. She caught Snotty, got him checked out at the vet to make sure he wasn't someone's lost cat, and came up with nothing.\n\nNow Snotty was *very* sick. He tested positive for FeLV and they were considering putting him down.\n\nThis is where I came in. My dog had passed away back in November, and our house was very lonely without an animal. I had taken care of disabled cats before and decided to take a risk. I paid for all his vet bills and was finally able to take him home May 20th.\n\nFor a former feral? He's friendly. And he loves my five-year-old. I often will catch them hanging out, watching the television or sleeping in his bed. The only time he fights me is when I try to give him his medication.\n\nStella called recently, said she was getting heat from her neighbors. They had caught wind of her traps (took them long enough) and demanded she return their \"community cats.\" Apparently they were feeding the local colony and got attached.\n\nSo? My family's just as attached. I went on the town's social media group, explained that Snotty was already adopted and living the best life. There was no way in hell he was becoming homeless again.\n\nI got dogpiled. One mom said I made her kids cry. Another, that I took the only happiness keeping their elderly parent alive (Wow, dramatic much?) Some lady kept spamming my messages until I blocked her, calling me transphobic slurs.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole for refusing to return a \"community cat\"?\n\n(Sorry, no cat tax because I'm pretty sure the person I'm talking about frequents reddit. This is probably going to escalate the drama anyways, but I want plausible deniability.)", "created_utc": 1693420093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165mlcr/aita_for_stealing_a_community_cat/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they actually cared about the cat, they would have gotten him the medical treatment he desperately needed. \n\n\"Only happiness keeping their elderly parent alive\" my fucking ass.

He'd been a favorite toy of the kids to play with and haul around (he was patient and just took their man-handling). I let him be an indoor cat, with the option to go out if he asked. He'd hear the children playing outside and RUN away from the door - never went outside again. All the neighbor parents complained, lol.", "Snotty your boy now. Keep a good eye on him if not inside.", "NTA if it was truly a community cat it would have been looked after despite being an outdoor cat", "NTA at all. What are these people thinking?? If they cared so much, they should have made sure the cats were all healthy instead of just feeding them. And taking in a sick, contagious cat deserves praise, not anger. Absolutely ignore those ridiculous people, and keep Stella away if you think she\u2019ll try and take him back herself. Thank you for taking care of Snotty", "NTA\u2026.if those people cared so freakin much, why aren\u2019t they taking care of the cats?  Getting them medical attention?  Spayed? Neutered?  They are part of the problem of feral cats.  Keep your kitty and do not put him back outside.  Your sister should do as she sees fit.

Until then, shut up.", "NTA \n\nI also got some heat from neighbors when I started trapping, tell your cousin to talk to the neighbors who HAVEN'T been feeding the colony. I bet there are more people who want them gone. It's cruel, they're devastating to the birds, and they're gross. I hope you rehome them all.", "NTA You already said the cat was very sick when you took him in. You have no obligation to these people. Maybe you should ask them if they want to chip in for his vet bills and care. I bet that will stop their complaining.", "Nta a cat who tested positive for FeLV should NOT be a community cat.", "NTA!  You saved his life.  They should have taken him and the other cats in if they wanted them.", "Apologies to everyone in advance because I'm going to use my outside voice for a moment - ALL THE KUDOS TO YOU AND YOUR COUSIN AND YOUR SON FOR LOVING 'SNOTTY' AND GIVING HIM A SAFE HOME AND A HUMAN BUDDY TO HANG WITH!!!\n\nAlso, NTA. There is so much neglect of community cats and no one is ever the A for showing a bit of compassion and trying to make it better. Yes, it's cute when they come around to be fed and maybe petted a bit - but not a lot of people bother to look into the reality of the issues these cats face once they're done feeding and petting. Chronic illness and disease that leads to shortened lives and very painful deaths. Extreme danger from predators and if not killed instantly they suffer horrendously with the wounds until the infection or parasites do the job. Only 1 in 4 kittens born in a feral community will survive past the first week (predators again, and post-natal illness and infection). Feral females will give birth to at least 2 and sometimes 3 litters a year, beginning at around age 6 months, and by age 2 or 3, the pregnancy kills them because their body just can't handle it anymore and shuts down completely.\n\nIf you continue to get guff from the people who think you \"stole\" their community cat - education and advocacy is a great non-violent response. Send them links to some of the fantastic organizations that care for and advocate for community cats.\n\nAlly Cat Allies is a great resource:\nhttps://www.alleycat.org/\n\nTinyKittens is also very well known and livestreams their rescue operations 24/7 for an up close and sometimes graphic look at the reality of cat overpopulation (people let their un-fixed pets roam and become stray, or they dump unwanted pets on farms, etc. and once the bow-chicka-wow-wow happens and kittens are born outside - you have a feral colony):\nhttps://tinykittens.com/\n\nAnd it sounds like your cousin is continuing to tnr? (hopefully she's doing the nr part!) Pass on my kudos to her too. The locals can still have \"their\" community cats, they'll just be healthier and happier community cats.", "NTA. You did the right thing by giving this cat a warm home.\n\nAlso I don't get the glorification of stray cats. \"Community cat\" is just a nice flowery word to make the situation sound nice. Only someone twisted would get angry at rescuing a stray cat.", "NTA you saved that cat! Congratulations on the new fur baby! Snotty will have a long great life!", "NTA they were neglecting him", "NTA. Anyone who actually loves a community cat would be thrilled he found a home.", "NTA at **ALL**. Let me get this straight - outdoor cat people hear you rescued a FeLV positive cat who was literally months if probably not weeks away from dying from the comorbidities of living outside with FeLV, if not just FeLV straight, and are now mad that you gave him a warm, loving home with access to quick veterinary care and a good diet? Absolutely not. This just solidifies my belief TNR and outdoor folks don't actually care about the long-term health of these cats. Cats belong indoors where they are safe from predators, disease (or spreading it), and all the rest of the troubles that befall these animals that have been cast aside to die awful deaths because of human ego. They're domestic animals that deserve a good family, not to die a slow and painful death in a now FeLV+ colony.", "NTA, if it was not for you the cat would have died.  Animal control told your cousin to trap the cats as they are a nuisance.  You may want to contact animal control about them feeding all of the cats.  The cat you saved was already sick, how many others are sick and spreading whatever they have.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I love the concept of Trap and Never Release and ideally that would involve humane euthanization for animals who will have no quality of life even after injury or illness is treated, protected sanctuary space for animals that won't adapt to being cared for as a pet, and access to necessary resources for organizations to properly support foster and adoption processes for those that will adapt to being cared for as a pet.\n\nMe personally, on an ideological or philosophical level, I can't buy into settling for euthanizing a treatable or healthy animal just because it doesn't have a home. I do recognize that this is the only option where resources are scarce and feral colonies, of all species, are unsupported and causing problems. I reluctantly support the practice, but I refuse to like it or advocate for it.\n\nFeral and outdoor cats are bad for the environment, yes. Eliminating feral colonies entirely is never going to happen. They breed faster than we can trap. I'm heartened somewhat by the changes in the ideology in the TNR communities I'm able to follow mostly on social media. They are slowly starting to work toward managing colonies so they are stable (no growth), healthy (no suffering), and low impact on the environment. One of the groups I follow is now involved in a research project with a local university to quantify the changes in predation when a colony is stabilized. I'm hopeful that getting a good result from these studies will change the ideology that euthanization is the only option.", "Ok, I apologise to Cousin- I read more into your story than was actually there.
