Ask the mailman to leave a note.\n\nParking partly on your property - this depends entirely on the easement.  If there is no restriction of what you can do there (in my city there isn't, in some place there are).  Large decorative boulders are the go to in my city, as this involves no digging and possibly interfering with whatever the easement is for.  Paint them white or a reflective paint.

We are literally the only house on the block without a driveway. We MUST park on the street, and prefer in front of our house. Every once in a while a car parks in the open space when one of us is gone. We both\u2026park elsewhere, one of us grumbling while we do. \n\nBut, a ma\u2019am. You live next to a TRIPLEX. you gotta assume 3-6 cars there and you see what kind of parking space they have.  People WERE ALWAYS GOING TO PARK THERE. Guaranteed you got a \u201cdiscount\u201d because 10 other potential buyers realized their \u201cRiverview\u201d would be blocked by parking for the multi-family dwelling next door. You got it cheaper because those people paid more to live away from triplexes. I got my house cheaper because I have no driveway.

The cops won't just take your word for it and call up the tow truck. They'd absolutely still be allowed to park there so long as they move it at least once every few days.", "did someone use the wrong account here?", "Well, look it up. It matters. Easement usually means passage, not storage. Don't think it ever includes parking on your property, so find out what it actually says.", "Just to clarify: if you own property with an easement, it is absolutely your property. However, you do have to abide by the terms of the easement, whatever they may be. (Which, in cases of right of ways or utilities access means free and clear passage, although sometimes with notice required (so someone may have to call you to open a locked gate, etc.).)", "It sounds like some grown ups need to have a conversation, and everyone is acting like children. People are going to park close to where they are going, that's why they drive. I didn't ask for a \"viable alternative\" I asked if there was parking a similar distance away. The lot down the street does not sound convenient to anyone, it just makes your view nicer. \n\nIf you are in a place that regulates parking and that lot is for visitors and they have to park there then sure, but if it's for a park or just a random lot or whatever, why should they have to park down the road from where they are going if there is legal parking closer?\n\nAs mentioned in another comment, are they on your grass, or are they on grass you maintain but the town/municipality owns? There's a good chance that if parking on the side of the road is permitted that means the grass out there actually doesn't belong to you.\n\nIf you really want to go the passive aggressive landscaping route I would find out from your deed/survey where your property actually begins, and if there are any conditions about things being close to the property line. Planting a shrub there to prevent the neighbours from parking there only for the snow plow to rip it out because it's on the road is a good way to piss off your neighbours and the town too.\n\nI get it, if I had a place with a nice view I would not want someone/thing to ruin that view. Unfortunately you have to buy more property farther away, or move somewhere with a very controlling HOA/bi-laws/Not-In-My-Backyard situation to make that happen, and moving outside of cities is how most people get away from those. \n\nYou might be able to start things over if you find a way to make an \"everybody wins\" compromise option available, but it sounds like you would have to build a lot of good will you don't currently have with them to make that happen.", "It does sound frustrating. If you think the shrubs/plants will help- go for it. Holly bushes are my favorite to make a point.", "The issue is that the cars MIGHT be on OP's property (cars are half on the grass and it's unclear if that part is OP's property), and the neighbours are moving their recycling bins just to park.\n\nSo it's a bit of a tricky situation.", "OP literally said \u201cI didn\u2019t buy a riverside property to stare at my neighbours cars all day\u201d hence my comment about obstructing the views\u2026 so not sure why you assumed there was nothing about an obstruction", "Oh plant something that drops berries", "That is not necessarily true.  There may very well be an easement.", "Or... everyone in Virginia has the same bee in their bonnet.", "I doubt it, probably just someone else who has dealt with a similar issue.  That's exactly what they did to me when I left my car parked on the street too long.", "Sounds like OP's bf DID talk to the neighbours about this. The neighbours elected to ignore them. So it's not like OP and her bf haven't done anything. They tried, even offering them an alternative with the recycling bins, and the neighbours MOVED the bins to park where they wanted, anyway. Which, honestly, if you're moving someone's recycling bins to park somewhere, I would think that would make it the neighbour's fault.

OP's neighbour has way too many vehicles for the parking they have, and are parking on the street (which it sounds like is the legal/available/viable option) in front of their house. OP doesn't like that, and has asked them to move to somewhere else on the side of their property, which is where the whole moving the bins thing happened. \n\nWe don't know what the layout is here, but moving the bins likely isn't some horrible neighbour being a horrible person, it's likely someone not wanting to hit a garbage can in a tight parking spot. \n\nThe alternatives given seem to be \"park somewhere farther away because I don't want to look at your vehicles\" which might be what OP wants in a vacuum, but it inconveniences the neighbours, who aren't really breaking any rules. They tried to keep her happy by parking where the recycling bins are, but apparently that option doesn't work either. \n\nIt sounds like both parties are being equally accommodating, and neither are getting what they want. This is why good fences make good neighbours, and if you don't want to see yours, you need to move somewhere far enough away from people for that to be possible.", "Even with easements, most places don't allow parking on grass. Well, most civilized places that is lol.", "I\u2019ll have to look those up.  Personally we got tired of city living and too close neighbors so we moved to the country and have a gate at the road.  And since it\u2019s a ways to the neighbors no car issues.", "Yeah, it's tricky, and maybe I'm simply having a tough time picturing the layout in general of the cars. I don't think OP can really do anything, regardless. But I also think the neighbours parking two of their cars (it sounds like) in front of OP's home, along with moving their recycling bins to accommodate two cars instead of just one (especially since the original layout was the neighbours parking in a spot that was on half of their own property, which is kind of fair) makes me still think the neighbours are kind of assholes. They may be allowed to, still kind of rude though. \n\nAt least, as far as I'm understanding the post.", "You're right, I'm having a hard time picturing everything, too.  Especially after OP said that the triplex has parking in back of it?  Of course, a triplex with more cars than they can really fit in the allowed space is not unusual. Unfortunately!\n\nThe thing I don't quite get about all this is... if these neighbors were not parking in front of OP's house, does OP imagine that nobody would, and she wouldn't have to look at ANY cars in between her house and the river? (Here I am assuming the river is across the street.)  In a neighborhood in which there are triplexes, that just seems weirdly naive of OP.
