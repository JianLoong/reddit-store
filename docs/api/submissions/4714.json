You need to rethink this because teens know how to get around having to delete their favorite apps. \n\nYTA if you don't do something more to find out what out your daughter and her friends think this is acceptable.", "ESH\n\nIt really seems like neither you nor your wife seem to be bothered by the fact that your daughter was caught doing something extremely bigoted\n\nYou seem to be focused on the vandalism and having to miss work\n\nAnd your wife seems to think that she'll just grow out of \"being racist\"\n\nThe two of you are failing this girl", "NTA.  -  but vandalizing was bad but did you address the antisemitism?", "ESH.  Granted, you\u2019re *way* ahead of everyone else in terms of at least treating this like a problem.

No you\u2019re NTA she should face the consequences of this and you should probably sit down and educate her about why this was so bad and how doing stupid shit like this could jeopardize her future. \n\nI\u2019m not really a fan of parents giving out random and really specific punishments that are not related to whatever the child did. Getting rid of TikTok might be fair, but the pizza thing is super random. Try to come up with something that will teach her about what she did wrong (I.e. if you vandalize, you scrub the mess or you don\u2019t get allowance and do chores until you \u201cmake\u201d enough money that\u2019s equivalent to the cost of cleaning the vandalism). Make her watch Schindler\u2019s list. Idk.", "NTA but mom's perspective is. Consider assigning your daughter to volunteer work cause that is what she'd do if charges were pressed. Does she even understand Jewish history? Assign her to read, write a report and present it to you on three books/sources regarding  something enlightening. Empathy and understanding is learned. Be actively involved that she garners movement in these traits. Best to you.", "NTA\n\nThis should only be the beginning of the punishment. Seems pretty light for vandalizing and hate.\n\nKids don\u2019t just grow out of something like this. 13 is old enough to know better. \n\nAs a parent I\u2019d be asking myself where I went wrong where daughter thought anti-semitism was in any way acceptable.", "Wait, your daughter participates in a hate crime and her punishment is no pizza and TikTok? \n\nFucking hell. \n\nYTA for not taking this seriously enough.", "NTA.  Your wife sounds like trouble though regarding parenting styles.  Sounds like she would excuse away anything.", "NTA, but the real issue is why is she vandalizing property with anti Semitic remarks and symbols and then threatening to hurt you and herself when she's punished by bad behavior? Your wife will keep saying \"she'll grow out of it\" until the law gets involved. You need to find the root of the problem before it gets worse.", "Wow, ok was leaning not TA except for the fact that you seem more upset that she's a vandal and you needed to leave work rather than that she was a little Nazi in training ....like literally. So I'm going ESH because you and your wife haven't even begun to understand the issue. Pizza SMDH.", "NTA, she did something that needs consequences and you\u2019re in charge of ensuring that happens", "NTA in regards to your wife, but this is a slap on the wrist for anti-semitic behavior.  Take this seriously now.", "NTA, but this should just be the start.  Like other commenters, I feel like you really blew past the antisemitism there, and your wife doesn\u2019t seem to care at all.  This is a really serious issue.  Other people have made some suggestions for ways to address that, so I won\u2019t be repetitive, but don\u2019t ignore the antisemitism, please!", "NTA- and your wife sounds like a scary enabler. You don't grow out of being racist. And every bad kid I grew up with that had lax parents that never punished them laughed about that right as they planned their next mischief. Now is the time to teach her. And no pizza for 3 weeks is far from the worst hellhole I've ever heard of, FFS. But if it stings enough to drive the point home, then good on you, OP.", "NTA. For grounding her, but you need to take more steps to ensure she doesn't continue with the antisemitism. Kids don't \"grow out of\" racism. If it was just vandalizing property that would be one thing, but writing antisemitic things is a horrible sign of a deeply troubled kid. Personally, if I found out my kid did that I would make her volunteer at a local synagogue or some similar experience to get her around the group she apparently is prejudiced against. And maybe get her in therapy to figure out what's going on to make her so full of hate.", "INFO From a practical standpoint, what does it mean to ban her from her favorite pizza place? Does she need to be driven there, and could her friends' parents simply take them? How often does she go there? Because this sounds like a really lenient punishment considering she committed a borderline hate crime.", "No where in your post have you said that you're disgusted/horrified/angry that your daughter is a bigot. You only seem to care about having to miss work.\n\nIn fact, neither you nor your wife seem to care about your daughter's alarming behavior. You need to get her therapy and keep her away from the other little bigots she hangs out with.\n\nYTA for your blase attitude. I can't believe how much you and your wife are under-reacting to this.", "She won\u2019t just grow out of it without proper parenting. Deleting social media plus three weeks of no pizza is an appropriate level of punishment.\n\nIMPORTANT: She needs to know that screaming about her punishment is not going to get her out of it. It\u2019s important not to give in on this.\n\nAlso IMPORTANT: you and your wife need to be presenting a united front on consequences. I hope she didn\u2019t scold you in front of your daughter. I hope you and she have an understanding about imposing serious consequences. If not, you should consult with her before declaring a punishment. \n\nIf the disagreement is about whether vandalism and hate speech are serious enough to warrant this kind of removal of a treat, you\u2019re right and your wife is wrong. But it\u2019s just as important that you two parents consistently as that you punish this behavior.\n\nNTA but I think you\u2019ve got some work to do.", "Oh my God. YTA for under reacting. Your daughter vandalized her school. What she tagged wasn't some idiotic cuss words or nickname. It was something HATEFUL. You gloss right over that, prioritizing leaving work over your daughter's exhibition of hate for an entire class of person. You and your enabler wife need to do some serious reflecting on the principles you are raising your daughter to have - or not have. Consider therapy for the whole family.", "Nta. She should learn that you can\u2019t vandalize something and deal with the consequences. And if you allow her to do these things de will not grow out of it and instead will do it more because she knows she will get away with it.", "NTA AT ALL!!  Kids need to learn the consequences of their actions.  You sound like a good dad.  Your wife, on the other hand, she needs to understand this.", "NTA. \n\nBut holy shit do your priorities need to reconsidered when your daughter gets caught being a bigot and your frustration is vandalism and missing work. \n\nThere are WAY WAY WAY bigger problems here.", "YTA because your punishment is way too lax. Obviously your wife is an even bigger asshole for thinking it doesn't even deserve punishment. Vandalizing with what I'm assuming are swastikas or something like that is extremely serious. She clearly has some really bad influences around her and it's not just tiktok, it's also her friends. 13 is a very pivotal age and you need to make sure she gets on the right path by taking a much more active role.", "NTA. Firm boundaries must be drawn or she will actually grow INTO worse behavior. Better she learn now that actions have consequences then having to learn from the judicial system later.\n\nLet her scream and cry...she will grow out of that.", "NTA. You\u2019re trying to raise her to be a responsible person. Your wife wants to enable her to be a disrespectful, spoiled brat. If daughter acts on her \u201cthreats\u201d, waste no time in holding her accountable. Especially if she is a danger to self or others. Let the law and mental health professionals handle her. A little time locked up in juvi or MH commitment can be a strong reality check for her. She can fuck around and find out! Don\u2019t let her play you.", "NTA\n\nI'm disgusted by your wife's response. \"she'll grow out of it\"?? Sounds like she doesn't think this is as awful as it is.\n\nAnti-semitism is often learned at home. Have you asked your daughter where she heard some of this stuff, or whether your wife has a problem with it or not?\n\nI also suspect you know what your wife is like, since you sound more \"frustrated\" than \"surprised and shocked\".\n\nWere this my kid, forget the pizza. That would just be for starters. There'd be no phone, no going out, and a special trip to the closest Holocaust Museum for a private tour.", "NTA. But I\u2019m shocked you worry about your daughter being a vandal and having to leave work early and not that she\u2019s a racist. I would suggest you educate her but somehow I think you are not the best person to do so\u2026", "YTA for focusing more on the vandalism and work and not the anti-Semitism. She\u2019ll grow out of the vandalism, but the anti-Semitism? That comes from somewhere and I doubt it\u2019s just Tik Tok. That you and your wife aren\u2019t too pressed about it makes me wonder if that\u2019s where she picked it up. If my kids displayed racist or bigoted behavior, they\u2019d wish their only punishment was the lack of pizza and Tik Tok.", "Anti semitism caused a whole fucking genocide. You are in now way the AH and your wife needs to pull her head in. NTA", "I would say NTA. 13 or not, you need to know when youre being an asshole. Not going to pizza sounds like a perfect repercussion to me.", "OMG NTA. actions have consequences. And you punishment could barely be called a punishment. Her reaction was overboard.", "Your wife is (can't say or I will be banned).\n\nNTA  Punish your child.  Seriously?  Not getting her favorite pizza for 3 weeks is deemed too much from your wife?  Dude, I would have been beaten and never allowed to hang out with those kids again.  Also, I would have been made to clean the vandalism.", "NTA. Thank you for taking appropriate action to this matter. However, it is extremely concerning that your wife is not taking this issue seriously enough. You don\u2019t just \u201cgrow out\u201d of antisemitism, and 13 is plenty old enough to know the difference between right and wrong. Has your wife downplayed or overlooked any other red flags your daughter has done?", "NTA\nChildren do not just \"grow out of\" something like that. Especially since they didn't care if it was wrong to do in the first place. \n\nBy making it become important (because of how serious the action was), to recognize how serious some actions can be or damaging, the consequence needs to be one that will cause pause should something like this become an option again. \n\nShe got off pretty light to be honest, and I am more troubled on why your wife doesn't seem like it's a big deal... This may cause further negative actions later down the road.\n\nGood for you for being a responsible parent in trying to raise a young adult to make good decisions. It definitely  isn't easy!\n\nEditing to add. When I was younger, my family had the opportunity to go to Germany. We toured the concentration camps, and to say it was overwhelming was an understatement. My parents exposed my brother and I as much as they could about things like this. But to actually walk there, see pictures, walk into the gas chambers/oven....... I still get emotional. It was an experience I will never forget.\n\nAt the time, my mother was a teacher and took some of the pictures I took to show her class that it was real (as it was something they covered in their history class.) And still people didn't believe it was real. Or that it even happened. So yes. It is very important to try to expose, teach, and have conversations about these things.", "NTA, and the family vacation should become a trip to the Holocaust Memorial.", "ESH. I think \"vandal\" might not be the right word. She didn't graffiti her name; she espoused ugly hatred.\n\nMaybe start talking to her about that part. Where she got it from is probably not just one place like Tik Tok.", "YTA because. .. YOUR PUNISHMENT WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH.\n\nDeleting an app and no pizza? That's it? Do you want a Nazi daughter? Because this is how you get a Nazi daughter. Get your house in order homie.", "No pizza and TT? And your wife thinks that\u2019s overkill? \n\nYTA, both of you. Vandalism is one thing but antisemitism is another. And this punishment does nothing to address the severity of antisemitism.\n\nYour wife is a double ah for dismissing this away like this is normal behavior.\n\nAlso, your daughter threatening you and herself is exceptionally problematic. Like, involuntary psych hold level problematic.", "NTA. I think that is a good repercussion. And the stuff she said about hurting you and herself would have gotten another week added. That's unacceptable. I would also sit with her and ask her why she is acting this way and how she feels as well. Get to the root of the problem and help fix it rather than only punish her.", "NTA but oh boy that's a light punishment for racism. \n\nYour wife's wrong. You have to correct that kind of behaviour immediately. Vandalism? Sure, she'll probably grow out of that. Hating Jews? Not so much. \n\nYou need to have a long talk with your daughter about where that's coming from (you're probably right about tik tok, but still) and why it's wrong. Teach her about Jewish history, and not just the holocaust. Approach this without anger, it needs to be a conversation. Make it connect with her emotionally. Movies might help with that.", "Big. huge. fat. NTA\n\nAnd good on you getting that kid off tiktok, nothing good happens there.  You may want to investigate her other social media activity as well.  It also seems like she's getting this from her friends too, so have a talk with her friends' parents if you know them, and reconsider who you allow your kid to spend time with.\n\nYou are right, she will not learn unless you teach her.  Yes she is still a kid.  Yes she doesn't know any better, but you teach her through consequences.", "YTA  You're not making her clean it up.", "YTA. Get your Nazi child in check. What type of person are you?", "Nta\n\nKids \"grow out of it\" when they learn that there are consequences for their actions. You parented correctly in this case.\n\nEdit to add- just noticed the vandalism also included hate speech.... the punishment should either be harsher, or you need to sign her up for some kind of therapy.", "NTA.

The fact that you only took tiktok and her favorite pizza place away they should be thanking you! I really think you need to take further steps especially after she threaten to harm you and herself. I'm looking at your wife sideways for thinking what she did doesn't warrant the light punishment you gave her.", "YTA for being more annoyed you need to leave work early than for your daughter vandalizing something with hate speech.", "NTA - For 13 years old she\u2019s also manipulating you and your wife should have a good look in the mirror cause she\u2019s in Amberwing. This horrible behaviour at 13. They know exactly what they\u2019re doing in the behaviours only going to get worse. Good for you for setting consequences.", "NTA. \n\nWhat your daughter did is despicable and she needs to learn from it. It does sound from hey reaction that she needs some help and support though. It sounds like there is something else going on with her.", "NTA\n\nBut YTA for thinking 3 weeks not going to her pizza place is any form of punishment. Its nothing, it is not enough and you are not taking this seriously.\n\nFind a documentary about the Holocaust - a very raw one that that goes into absolute minute detail and sit her down and force her to watch the horror. Then ask her how she feels about what she saw. Ask her to read the Anne Frank book. Then tell her to write an essay on what she learnt about the Holocaust.  EDUCATION is the first part.\n\nIf it works then keep this as is and keep the 3 weeks ban on the pizza place, if she resists the education part or doesnt take it serious then your punishment has to be more serious - ban the wifi and data on her devices at home apart from enough time for homework infront of you. Delay her xmas presents bar maybe one until her birthday dependent on no repeat behaviour.\n\nAlso I'm shocked at your wife, your daughter has no chance with her mothers attitude.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You all need your heads examined.\n\nYTA, and so is your wife and your kid.", "Tiktok and pizza are the least of your worries my guy", "\\> I was frustrated because not only did I just hear that my own daughter is a vandal but also the fact that I had to leave work early and miss an important meeting because of that\n\nSo the nazi part isn't frustrating? Also a 13-year-old shouldn't have tiktok. \n\nYTA\n\nTake her to a holocaust museum.", "Right? \n\n> not only did I just hear that my own daughter is a vandal but also the fact that I had to leave work early\n\nSomething tells me he's OK with the messages she was writing. Because if my kid was caught writing anti semetic hate speech, that is what I would be upset about. Not just her being a \"vandal\". \ud83d\ude44", "Haha I'll probably get downvotes for the assumption.\n\nShe probably learned it from Mom and Dad!\nOr indirectly, cause Mom and Dad have been keeping up on Chapelle and Ye.", "Can't forget that she also threatened to do bad things to op and herself maybe you should put her in therapy.", "It's not borderline.  Spray painting antisemitic crap IS a hate crime.", "\"committed a hate crime.\" Nothing borderline about it. But otherwise 100% agree with your comment.", "If only Goebbels' parent had refuse to give him dessert for a week or 2...", "No, they were just regular swastikas, which makes it fine **/s**", "That won't help. Watching torture porn isn't going to make a thirteen year old think \"I could be doing that if I'm not careful\". In fact, it's more likely to lead to the comforting lie that \"they must have deserved it somehow\".\n\nInstead, humanise us. Make us *people*, talk about our normal everyday lives. If we're just, you know, Sarah down the way then it's far harder for seeds about \"global conspiracy\" or \"control the media\" to stick. Sarah's parents? But she's failing math and they didn't even ground her! (Or whatever, you get the picture).", "\"And no toppings!\"", "That\u2019s what many will believe whether true or not.", "They won't, and the charges wouldn't stick on a child that young. Trust me, I experienced some \"bully the weird nerdy new kid\" that got *way* out of hand (genuinely not the school's fault) and one of the things they latched onto was \"Jew kid\". It's in South Park, see, it's funny \ud83d\ude11\n\nTotal punishment for the pair who'd been ringleading for six months: one detention (each). For the kid who felt empowered by all this to say something really egregious*a meter from the teacher* and then denied it to her face? Stern talking-to. I have to assume that Words Were Had with the class in my absence, because the open antisemitism stopped after that, but... yeah, no, it's going to have to get a *lot* worse before the school will press charges.", "No, he really cared more about needing to leave work to be a parent...", "He cared more about missing a work meeting! Also he glossed over the fact that his daughter threatened to hurt him and herself? That\u2019s not normal? I can\u2019t believe his and his wife\u2019s reaction. The girl is a racist but still young and impressionable, they still have time to get her to change her way of thinking, but they don\u2019t seem to care enough.", "well he wouldnt have had to leave work if she had scribbled that stuff in her personal notebooks /s", "Yes that should tell you where their kid learned it from. Hint. It's not tik tok.", "Also Night & Fog, a short documentary by Alain Resnais. A teacher showed us that in high school and I've never forgotten those images from the camps. I knew about the Holocaust and had read Anne Frank's diary in middle school, but the film really brought the horror (and the evil) home.", "Yes and also, it sounds like the girl does sound like she has mental health issues. Maybe she really just picked it up on tiktok, but when people turn to radicalization, it's often because they feel disempowered or restricted. The fact that she threatens to harm herself is a big warning sign for underlying issues! I don't want to say that the daughter behaved correctly here - the parents absolutely have to intervene.  But they should keep their eyes open, because something seems to be going terribly wrong here. My voting is ESH\n\nEdit: I am aware she also threatened her father. I still believe she is not necessarily a convinced fascist", "There\u2019s consequences! You could be president. Or the richest person in the world. Maybe she will buy tik tok someday.", "Why are you so willing to blame everything on the wife?  OP's remark about having to miss a business meeting already shows that he's not taking this issue too seriously.  This is definitely on both parents, not just the wife.", "Yeah, I'm surprised she isn't accusing her dad of taking after the infamous Soup Nazi.\n\nNo pizza for you!\n\nIn what world is \"no pizza for three weeks\" a fitting consequence for publicly announcing your intentions of joining Hitler's Youth through damaging property?\n\nAll three of these chuckleheads need a reality check!", "Wow - this made me laugh. But its so true....evening and weekend hate crimes are ok...", "She also threatened to harm OP. She's a burgeoning Hitler youth. They need an intervention stat.", "Yeah, the daughter is turning out to be a shitty person. Bigots can have perfect mental health, let's not assume she's got problems outside of being a bigot.\n\nI know, you're gonna say something about the self harm. To me that's not got anything to do with being a bigot.", "She threatened to hurt her father too not just herself", "Because OP's punishment was too light but the wife thought even that was too much. They are both a problem but they are not equally the problem.", "But she also is not necessarily a full blown bigot, especially since her familymembers are not (she could become one though). A reason for this behaviour could be that she understands that it is dramatic, and something that draws attention. Since the parents here are focusing on their own inconvenience instead of whatever is going on with their daughter, I believe that they weren't paying attention for a long time. So she is acting out, and found this drastic enough. It could be that she supports whatever they drew there, but at the same time she may not fully understand it either.", "I definitely got the feeling that the parents' attitude is \"We don't mind your anti-Semitism, but we really don't want you to be so blatant about it.\"", "I actually left teaching because of similar actions by a student who likely \u201chad no hate in their heart\u201d", "I get the feeling that the parents don't think she's actually antisemitic, just edgy and egged on by TikTok. It's still important for the parents to address why the specific vandalism was so bad, but I'm not convinced the parents are antisemitic because they're punishing the daughter for vandalism rather than antisemitic vandalism.", "I\u2019m really sorry. I hate that it\u2019s always on us to educate and assume the best of people when they use words and imagery specifically designed to invoke an attempted genocide. \n\nI hope that you found a career where you feel safe and are treated with respect. I hope that the student eventually changed. That being said, it\u2019s not your responsibility to suffer so that someone can learn a little humanity."]}
