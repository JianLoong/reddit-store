She's always been very gifted academically, and since 3rd grade was a year ahead in school. We always made sure she wasn't too overstressed, and made sure she was still having time to be a kid, we didn't want her to end up burning out. Overall she was quite happy and seemed to be in a good place until last year.\n\nShe was a sophmore, but the school said her grades were good enough to skip another year, and go stright to senior year. She was hesitant, but they said it would be good for her development and so we decided to move her up, which I regret. She still got good grades, but was very stressed and busy. She has a great work ethic, but sometimes I think it causes her to put more effort than is healthy into her work. She was tired, less outgoing, and generall more down. She had a hard time getting along with the older kids, and never made any new friends. The worst part was she skipped junior prom, and had nobody she even knew to go to senior with.\n\nSo she's graduating this year, and explained that she doesn't want to go to college next year. I get her reasoning, she'll be much younger, and sharing classes with much older adults. She thinks she overdid it (it isn't her fault but she thinks otherwise) skipping two grades and wants to just relax. She said she's sick of never getting to spend much time with people her age, and wants to age into college a bit. She's willing to work and stay busy this next year, but doesn't want to do college yet.\n\nI think it's the right call, she's still a kid, and will have more time to enjoy it. I'm honestly more worried about her socially than academically, all the degrees in the world won't matter if she can't talk to anybody. My wife disagrees, and thinks she'll waste the entire year when she could be studying.

But it is at that age. Being mindful of your daughter's mental well-being does not make you a \"fun parent\" it makes you a caring parent. Since your daughter seem to be feeling depressed/burnt out I would recommend you sanding your ground. Her academic possibilities won't diminish from waiting a year.", "NTA\n\nYou are recognizing the early signs of burn out for your daughter. If you were to \"force\" her into college now, it would just get worse. \n\nGood on you for taking mental health seriously. \n\nMANY adults take a gap year to recharge mentally, and because she is 2 years ahead, after her gap year she will still be one year ahead. Win win for everyone.", "NTA - you're not being a \"fun parent,\" (not to say you aren't fun lol) you're caring for your daughter's health! People shouldn't work themselves to death, yk? It's reasonable to take a break. Heck, think of all the stuff she could do in that year: make new friends, find job opportunities, find new hobbies, exploring what she wants to do with herself and her future, probably much more. Not wasting time at all, imo! Caring about your daughter's well-being is caring about her future. All that work is gonna go to waste if she's too burnt out to take care of herself, and that's obv going to affect her work as well. People need breaks!!", "I'm going to say NTA.\n\nI have a child who is in a very similar position, and is about to graduate at fifteen. She wants to spend a couple of years working, and building up some savings before starting college, and honestly I agree with her. Not just because it will give her a chance to age into the college she wants to attend, but because it will give her an idea of what real world responsibilities look like, and a chance to build up some savings for herself before she really enters the real world on her own. So my personal opinion is definitely NTA.", "NTA. \n\nSo she finishes University early too? then what? Works till 65 or retires 2 years earlier than her peers? What's the end goal with rushing through it all? \n\nPersonally, I think the journey should be enjoyed just as much as the finish line.", "NTA...So what if she wastes her entire year instead of studying?  Your daughter is politely telling you that she's not ready.  You obviously got the message--good on you.", "NTA.\n\n16 is too young for a university setting. You sound like you're from the US, but even where I'm from there's quite the difference between the way 16 year olds and 18 year olds act. \n\nGap years are also awesome.\n\nEven if she was 18+ I'd say have a gap year!", "As someone who graduated at 16,i say NTA. I wish I'd taken a gap year or 2 rather than jumping right in. I might have actually stuck with college instead of dropping out.", "NTA. Your daughter is burning out, and you have a chance to support her or put more pressure on her. A 16 year old is going to struggle socially in a traditional college setting, and will be more vulnerable to manipulation by sketchy people. Your daughter having an extra year of studying isn't going to help her if she's too burnt out to continue the next year. She can take some time off to work and destress, then decide how she wants to proceed. Good for you for supporting her.", "NTA but your wife is! She's 16 years old and has achieved a lot academically, but yes, she has completely suffered in her social life, which to a teenager is almost everything. She deserves to be rewarded and have at least one year off! And then reevaluate where she's at, at the end of that year. Please do what's best for her, she's honestly earned it!", "NTA.\n\nI agree with her and you. Far too many gifted students burn out. She can afford to pace herself. Whatever she chooses, it hardly sounds like she's going to be a failure in life. There seems to be a lot of pressure on her to overachieve here.\n\nAnd the 2 year age gap is pretty large. 1 year is a lot more manageable. \n\nFinally, a gap year offers a lot of opportunity for personal development. I suggest encouraging her to think about what she wants to do but aside from that, go for it.", "NTA. Does she have to graduate? If she has met all her requirements, is it possible to go half day to high school classes that are focused on enrichment and enjoyment.\n\nLots of our seniors go half day their senior year and just take their music or art classes. \n\nAfter all the work that got them there, it is a break for them to focus on the fun parts of high school that they missed earlier. A lot also do internships or volunteering part of the day so they are more well rounded.\n\nA gap year is fine too if that is what they really want to do!", "NTA - based on your description, it sounds like the mental peace that a year off would bring her is well worth the price of delaying college by a year. Living a balanced life is so much more important than dominating in one specific area (i.e. academics).\n\nMaybe a \"selling point\" to your wife could be for her to use this year to catch up on some of the things she missed out on while focusing too hard on academics - i.e. social development, health habits. Rather than characterizing it as just relaxing and lounging around for a year.", "NTA. You DO care about your daughter's future, which is why you're making sure that mentally, she's ready for college. Your daughter is telling both of you how she feels. It seems you're the only one listening.", "NTA. You need to put your daughter's wellbeing first.", "NTA!\n\nBurnout is a real thing and they are going to be burnt out so fast.  She is still going to be ahead.  No issues with letting her take off. Good for you for listening to her.", "**NTA** \n\nThere is absolutely nothing that she is missing out on by taking a year off. She's 16, she needs time to be a kid with other kids and to reflect on what she actually wants to do in school.\n\nWhat would be a waste is for her to jump right into college, spend several years in a track she eventually decides she hates, and then quit or switches to something else. Or worse, she gets a degree in something she doesn't want to do and ends up not using it.\n\nTbh, she graduated two years early, I'd tell her to take two years. I'd consider telling her that she needs to be *doing* something during that time - volunteering, working, whatever. But that's an educational experience all on its own. The real world is a place she's going to need to exist in and spending a year or two working or volunteering and interacting with that real world is learning.\n\nYou can frame it to your wife as this *is* your daughter studying, just studying how to be a functional adult.", "NTA. It's just as important for your daughter to be emotionally and socially ready as it is for her to be academically qualified. She realizes that she needs more socializing and should be enabled to work on that. It might help for you, your wife and your daughter to talk to a counsellor about a plan to ready her for college. Your daughter needs to well rounded in all areas to be successful. Good grades alone won't make her happy or fulfilled. Good job parenting to realize this and help her.", "NTA, your daughter's opinion is the most important one here and the worst thing would be to burn her out. Your wife needs to take a step back and really listen to your daughter - while your wife's concerns about \"wasting the year\" might be valid in a way, this can also be a really enriching year if it plays out right.\n\nOne thing your daughter might consider is not going all-in on the gap year. Maybe pick up just one or two courses at a local community college and working a part time job to keep her sharp and engaged (both academically and socially).", "NTA. Your daughter needs time to just be a kid and relax. I'd honestly wait and let her relax before going and working.", "I think you really do have your daughters future to heart. It's not only about academics. \n\nAnd I think you are a great dad who truly listens to his daughter.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I went to college a year early and it is the biggest regret of my life. I was ready academically, I was ***not*** ready emotionally/mentally. I was entirely too immature, went crazy with the new-found freedom, partied WAY too much and ended up withdrawing after one semester to keep from failing out. I never went back. Your daughter is being smart about this, listen to her.", "NTA for two reasons; one, burnout is real, and by what you describe it sounds like she is absolutely burnt out, which is no way to start college. Secondly even that aside; whether she goes to college at all and when should be *her* choice, you letting her make the choice that's right to her instead of forcing her to do something she doesn't want to do is the right call.\n\nCollege is going to be the start of her making her own decisions as an adult, don't have her first adult decision be one you make for her against her will.", "NTA. I skipped two years and graduated at 16.  I finished grad school by 21.  I don\u2019t regret it, but I definitely outgrew my friends in high school and college.  It doesn\u2019t help I am a loner by nature.\n\nYou let her get so far ahead because she was responsible and mature enough to handle it.  Why are you questioning her judgment now?\n\nMy suggestion would be to let her get a year\u2019s part time working experience with an emphasis on saving.  See if she can get an entry level position or volunteer hours in a field she might be interested in.  What really helped me was Girl Scouts and drama club. My best friend\u2019s mom basically turned girl scouts into a social club for the five of us.", "NTA - Seems pretty obvious to me.  She is immature (not for her age, for her grade level) and should be given a chance to catch up.  Also, she should have a chance to be a person, not a studying machine.", "NTA. She's going to be in uni with people at least 2 years older than her and that will be hard. It sounds a sensible idea. Many teens have a gap year before uni even if they aren't advanced so I think your wife is overreacting quite a bit.", "In this case, a gap year sounds like a great idea. Has she thought about maybe taking a class or two at a community college, if she wants to keep her study skills sharp? It\u2019s possible she could get transfer credit for it when she does go to college.", "NTA but doing nothing shouldn\u2019t be an option either.  Is there a community college where she can take \u201cfun classes\u201d like ceramics and art appreciation part time?  Something fun but still in an academic setting so she doesn\u2019t lose her edge.  Alternatively, she could work somewhere.  My only point is that she shouldn\u2019t do nothing.  That said, I fully agree with her taking 1-2 years off before college.  She\u2019s still very young.", "NTA - she deserves to decompress. I don't think she'd be very happy going straight into college. She's already feeling stressed and vulnerable. Also her working while she take the gap isn't wasting her time. She'll improve her social skills and make some money while doing it. It's ultimately her decision not you or your wife's. Stick to you instinct and support her. This isn't about being the \"fun parent\" this is about what's best for your daughter and her mental health.", "Nta. Taking a gap year is an excellent idea, if your wife is that worried, she can agree to save x amount of her wages a month to go towards costs, or some other target to ensure she's not simply wasting the time. But your daughter won't have any fun when she's too young to take part in activities with her peers, she will struggle socially from that, and as she already feels the pressure from the previous year, it's a good idea to take the year to refresh, recharge, and mature a bit and be in a level playing field with her peers.", "I'm with you on this one. She needs to slow down, or her future is filed with high electable of herself that she'll never be able to keep up with, which will lead to depression and feelings of worthlessness. Let her learn to relax before she grows up to think she's not allowed.", "NTA- gap year is usually a good thing and forcing her into college is never the answer. LIFE is never a waste, she will be working, she will be seeing how things function and this will also help her see what she wants to do with her future.  Studying isnt the answer for everything.", "NTA. She said she will work, so she won't be wasting the year, right? Having some experience working before starting collage is great, it gives you more to go on regarding your future career. That's a great way to get some use out of having finished school early, while it also gives her some time to focus on other things than studying, which she seems to need. Your wife is the AH.", "NTA - Her mental health will take a blow that could take years to recover from if she continues on to college. Things will just get ever more unpleasant for her. You're suggesting the right thing.", "NTA. She worked hard and deserves a rest. Also this year  could be not wasted time but she could figure out what does she like the most", "NTA soooo much. You do her best. And she seems to be aware of the disadvantages of being gifted. With that she has a great future ahead! \n\nWhat is a year compared to a live time that is ahead of her?", "Speaking as the mom of a college student 100% NTA. Your wife on the other hand is a total AH. If she thinks your daughter is mature enough to go off to college she should also think she is mature enough to make her own decisions regarding her life. Thank you for standing up for your kid.", "I was your daughter in school (though I only skipped one year, I was already one of the youngest kids in my grade, so effectively 2 years younger). I also played 3 varsity sports and had a part time job.\n\nWhen I got to college, I played college basketball (D3, not a scholarship, but still, lots of time commitment) and had no idea what to do in college. I tried like 5 different majors and did okay, but couldn't pick one and ultimately quit basketball and got depressed and dropped out for a year and a half back at home working a couple shitty retail jobs and living in a shared apartment.\n\nOnly then did I appreciate school and figure out what I wanted to do, and honestly, that's not even that common. I think a year off would be good for her, BUT, I would try to have some kind of plan and not just spend a year doing nothing.\n\nMaybe she could try to do an internship or work and save money? Perhaps you guys could travel a bit with her (she's a bit young to send off to europe by herself) or do something out of the norm. Are there any interests she's wanted to dive into that she's never had time for (like learning to sail or ride horses or whatever?) that she could kind of dive into?\n\nBut I think that's the answer, she clearly looks like she's burning out a bit, and college is going to be REAL awkward if she's turning 17 and everyone else is 18+.", "I'd like to add that if you're worried about her, talk to her about her mental health, ask how she's actually doing, since you've noticed some changes. If she's truly not doing well, make sure she gets assessed by a mental health professional. Not saying she's necessarily mentally ill, just that burnout is an issue that should be taken seriously. And it's good to help her get in the habit of checking in with herself regarding how she's doing since she seems like the type that could easily end up burnt out.", "NAH\n\nI respect you listening to your daughter and her needs. I echo the comment about half-days at school without graduating. Taking some of those fun classes could still be a good way for her to figure out what she wants in life, take it easy, and have some friends her age. University would be way too intense for someone her age who's still trying to grow and mature.", "NTA and a gap year doesn't have to be sitting around. I took a gap year between high school and college and spent that time volunteering each week at the local animal shelter and taking \"for fun\" (not translating to what I wanted my major to be, chosen because of my interest in them) classes at the local community college.", "NTA. Your wife seriously needs to re-assess what counts as being for the good of your daughter's future. College is not just about academics, but also for learning how to socialize and network. \n\nYour daughter has a good head on her shoulders. The last thing you want to do is break her mentally by placing her in a situation where she knows she struggles to fit in.\n\nFurthermore, many top-performing students take a gap year either before college or grad school or career. There are many life-broadening experiences one can strive to partake in during a gap year. So I wholely reject the idea that a gap year is necessarily a waste of a year.", "NTA. at all. Consider a year of volunteering and no pressure side classes that interest her. She's not an adult yet so I think she should be allowed to enjoy her childhood before it's gone. If she's smart and academically motivated, she'll find a non structured way to continue learning something during that gap year.", "NTA!  I remember when I was a senior in college, we had this extremely bright guy who was in the newspapers for finishing high school at 15.  His problem was that all of us were 20/21 and he was 17.  He was friendly and all, but he couldn't connect with anyone.  Those are years when people are changing quickly and having some emotional maturity is a huge benefit.  Tell her to get a job, see how other teenagers live, go on some dates, etc.  She'll be better off for it.", "NTA.  I went to college at 16, and I regret it.  Honestly, I don\u2019t regret graduating early, because half my classes were community college by that time anyway.  But I was too young to be on my own and responsible for my education (not that I would have been willing to admit that at the time), and I almost ruined a first class education.\n\nNow I am a professor, and the students who have the problems are often those who just went to university because \u201cit was the thing to do next.\u201d  People should go to university because there is something they want there (want a lot).\n\nYou are being a good mom.", "NTA.\n\n16 to 18 or 19 is a HUGE age gap from a social and life experience perspective.\n\nGetting a job, volunteering, whatever for a year (or 2) might even help with selecting or confirming her course of study.", "NTA, but a 16, she isn't going to have much she will be able to do in a gap year. Perhaps you can split the baby, and she can take a class or two at the community college. That way, she still has plenty of time off and is still working on her education.", "NAH - there isn't a lot of context here, but I see both sides of this argument. Your daughter DOES need a break, but have you discussed what happens after the gap year or the two year gap years and I think that's where your wife's mind is at. What happens if that gap year stretches until she's in her mid-20s? Do you guys have a plan? Also I don't see her calling you the fun parent out of nowhere and there is probably more to that than what we are getting. However, that is more of a side bar. I don't see either parent being assholes here as they both have the kid's future in mind.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And you are thinking of her future. Burnout is very real. Maybe compromise and suggest she takes a class at a community College.", "NTA - It is vitally important to listen to your daughter. \n\nYour wife's approach, ramping up the speed & incline of your daughter's life, is not healthy and to what ends? A FastPass through Disney is fine but not through life. Your daughter has already lived & articulated the down sides. Celebrate her successes and allow her to create and explore a cool year; she earned it!", "NTA you're right. If your wife values education so much, she should learn about brain development. Your daughter's instincts are good.", "NTA\n\nA couple of years make a much bigger difference socially at that age than when you're just younger or a fair bit older. You need extra confidence not less to do well away from home with that older crowd. \n\nCan you find something for her gap year which allows her to build digital confidence?\n\nA volunteer trip abroad, or something like that?", "I didn't skip grades, but I was too focused on grades in high school, had only one friend, no dates and was too emotionally immature when I got to college. I never really got my life on track. Don't do that to your daughter; gifted children often turn into burned out adults. You're NTA for letting her relax and mature before college. You don't want her to come home pregnant at 17.", "NTA. I started college at 17, and it sucked being the only one who couldn't participate in things (drinking age is 18 here). I also question the wisdom of dropping a poorly socialized underage girl into frat boy territory. \n\nIs there a compromise? Could she do an exchange year and retake her senior year abroad? Grades don't matter much in a post-grad exchange, and she can get some life experience, learn a language, and have some fun so she doesn't burn out in college.", "NTA.  Even for 18 year old seniors, it would be reasonable to take a gap year prior to college.  Also, whatever topic she is interested in, she could study it independently.  It doesn't mean her study skills will atrophy over 1-2 years.  Also, it sounds like she needs a break from the rat race of school.\n\nIf it's an issue of getting into the best college, I cannot say how undergraduate will view such gap years, but I can tell you that for medical school, it is not viewed negatveily.", "NTA. How about a student exchange year in another country so she can learn or improve a second or third language? I was 16 when I graduated in the US and then did 12th and 13th grade in Germany and then graduated there too. Then I did a gap year and started studying at 19.", "NAH  I agree with both of you, despite how gifted your daughter is she must've been working hard to pull that off so yes, she deserves some downtime. But she also shouldn't lose her momentum- your wife is right too. What if your daughter took 6 months off and then the next 6 months take 2 or 3 online classes instead of a full class load. The next year she'd only be a year younger. My mother did the same thing by the way, she graduated with a 4.0 at 16 and got sent away to college. She completed one year and then ran home and married her 18 year old alcoholic boyfriend. I think she was too young and ran back to what she considered was safe. It was not. Sit down with your daughter and have a real conversation with her - she may be academically old enough for college but emotionally theres a huge difference between college and high school.", "NTA. I was homeschooled and my parents pushed me to finish early and start university at 16. I was burnt out and not ready. My first year was a terrible experience and I took an extra year to finish because I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do for awhile and didn\u2019t want to be there. Now all is well, I have a degree and a good career but a gap year would have been so much better. \n\nIf your wife is really worried she\u2019ll get out of the habit of school and not want to go back, maybe suggest to your daughter she take an easy class or two at the community college that will knock out some core requirements for when she does go to a four year school, and maybe help her ease into to college work. But also a break is totally fine - she sounds burnt out and if she goes for a full college load immediately the chances of her dropping out are much higher", "NTA, it seems like you're the only one looking out for your daughter's wellbeing here. You're already seeing the effects of her skipping grades, and it will only get worse if she starts college so early. Your wife needs to stop living vicariously through her daughter and instead start prioritizing her mental health. Let her be a kid, there's no need to rush her into adulthood.", "NTA. Struggling in her first year of college because she's still burnt out from accelerated high school, doesn't really want to be there, and feels socially isolated among much-older peers is not going to be great for your daughter's future, either.\n\nThis is your daughter's decision, ultimately -- and delaying college for a year while she figures herself out is frankly a very mature one for her to make.", "NTA. I also skipped two grades and ended up in college at 16. Even though I was in state and lived on campus it was still a huge pain. I couldn't join any club or class activities that went over the state line without explicit permission from my parents. On campus food services that served alcohol couldn't let me in to eat after a certain time of the evening, which sucked a lot because I had lab classes that ran late. Let her take the year off, and if your wife is that concerned, maybe she can knock out some part-time classes at the local community college.", "Your daughter is absolutely brilliant and completely in the right here. Honestly she\u2019s demonstrating considerable maturity in this decision. NTA at all.", "I think you are right. She would be severely limited in social activities at college at 16. You have to be 18 to do most things, and you won't be there to give permission further stunting her growth. She needs a year to work on her mental health and social growth or she won't succeed in college much less in life. Without good social skills, she just won't make it. No matter how many brains she's got.", "NTA, you should make a plan for her gap year though. Can you afford to send her somewhere to learn a language?", "NTA, but she needs a plan for that year, otherwise 1 gap year turns into 10 really easily.", "I graduated from school at 15 years old, my mom let me rest and enjoy a year and I started university at 16 years old.  Even so, I was much younger and it was difficult for me to relate since the other students were between 18 and 20 years old, however I adapted over time, that year off helped me a lot", "NTA\n\nThank you for looking out for your daughter's emotional well-being. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't even suggest that she work, unless she really really really wants to. I would just let her be a kid for a bit. Let her go on fun trips, let her take some fun community classes for hobbies she is interested in, let her go to concerts, do all that stuff that kids normally do in their teenage years. Encourage her to join groups where she can meet other people her age so she can socialize and make some friends her age. She might be gifted academically, but kids like her can be stunted in the social-emotional department, so encouraging social activities will be good for her! Then when she is ready to attend college/university, she will be a well-rounded individual who can handle all the stresses of modern collegiate life. \n\nIf she is forced to go, she will likely burn out in a year or two and ultimately quit. Trust me, there is no one single timeline/path into adulthood. There are multiple paths to success, and supporting your daughter's choice to take a gap year (or two!) will ultimately benefit her in the end.", "Suggestion: has the girl explored ideas about her desired field of study/ work? If she is mature enough, how about a gap year, where she does work for a small stipend but also aquires some academic credentials /transferrable skills. Some examples, depending on her interests are: \n\n-internships in research (there are adaptive protocols for minors, or, if computationally inclined, she can do that only, without wet lab) \n-archaeological digs\n-conservation work\n\nIt can be an entire year with one project, or more manageable sections of say 6 week - few months (eg field work).  This could be a win win: she broadens her social experiences, aquires transferable \"soft\" skills and may actually gain academic credits and put something in her CV.", "There are a lot of cool things a teen can do to expand their horizons, get some experience, learn, and grow that isn't hitting the books hard.\n\nI only had a couple classes to take my senior year and so I got out at noon. I got an internship with a state assembly campaign and met cool people, learned a lot, and had a great addition to my resume. It gave me a lot of confidence I was previously lacking. \n\nThere's also volunteering, travel, earning/saving money, and other academic opportunities. She could even knock out some of the gentler gen Ed classes at the local community college. I sort of did that. I ended up majoring in international relations and diplomacy so it was better that I knocked out unrelated intro things like \"nutritional science\" in an abbreviated summer program. I took an art class that way too. Saved money that way too!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Coming from someone who dropped out of school specifically to go on to a technical college, I was the youngest person there and although I did great at first I got burnt out 6 months in. A mistake my mother fully accepts because since she had to pay for tuition she registered me in a course SHE wanted me to do. Also, I didn't make any friends there either and because of the commute 4 days a week and always studying, I lost all the friends I had at home. Anyway, now years later I have an associate's degree working a job I love working with individuals with disabilities. Take it from me, you do not want your daughters brain to snap and become like some of the people I work with. Brilliant minds can collapse if pushed to the limits. Let her take a gap year. Let her mind be free for awhile before pushing it again.\n\nNTA", "Wow. Definitely NTA and you should be proud of your daughter for recognizing a problem she was having and expressing what she needs. She\u2019s burnt out. You are right to worry more about her socially than academically, overall IF she is able to take the year off. If she doesn\u2019t take the year off, she may have trouble academically too. She could also take the time to volunteer or shadow in fields that interest her as possible careers.\n\nI can understand her not wanting to go to college yet. One of my roommates in college entered at 16. She missed out on several things because of her age. For example, she couldn\u2019t go to a couple of local graduation events because she was still under 21 when she graduated. She went to med school and eventually had to repeat a year.", "NTA. I was put in kindergarten early, and was recommended to skip another grade at some point, but thankfully my parents said no. I then went to a really rigorous high school, and graduated when I was 17 (and a long way from being 18). I went straight to college, but in retrospect, I really wish I had taken a gap year. I was always aware of being younger, and I was burned out from being pushed academically. I did not do well my freshman year, despite being theoretically well prepared.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know for sure, but I think I had taken a gap year, I probably would have gone for a PhD. Professors were pushing me for it, offering letters of recommendation, etc., but by the time I could see college graduation as being reasonably close, I couldn\u2019t stomach the idea of the GRE and five more years of school (biology). I just wanted to get a job and have a normal life that wasn\u2019t constantly dominated by high pressure academics. After a few years of working, going back to school seemed like a huge step back in quality of life, and I never did it.", "NTA. I ended up skipping the sixth grade when my mom got married and we moved to a new state. That decision was right for me but it meant I started college at 17 and I ran into a number of problems because I was still technically a minor so if I had to go to the campus clinic my mom had to be called and verified it was okay for me to seen. I didn\u2019t turn 18 until a week before my first semester was over. I also wouldn\u2019t send a sixteen year old off to a college campus, regardless of how mature she is. Let her have a year or two off, get a job and see what both interests her and where her passions lie. Also please please please please sit down with her when she thinks she has a major she is interested in and look at jobs and their pay scales that the major would qualify her for. I went in as an education major and my first job earned me 25,000 for the year. I barely got by.", "NTA. I was in that situation and hand on heart, at 45, I can say going to college at 16 was the worst. \nI was burnt out, didn't enjoy and of it and never fulfilled the \"potential\" everyone said I had.\n\nFight for your child", "I wish my parents let me take a gap year, than maybe we wouldn\u2019t have wasted 20k+ just for me to drop out due to my mental health", "NTA. Burned out gifted kid here. I was loaded on with AP classes and being 2 years ahead in my math classes, you\u2019re making the right call. She\u2019s exhausted and needs a break, good on you for standing up for that. I was 17 going into college and I think that that was a good age for me to start, thinking of how I was at 16 and if I were in an environment with young adults, I would\u2019ve been scared and overwhelmed out of my mind. Even if she takes a gap year, she will still be a year ahead. Stand your ground on this, thank you for standing up for her.", "NTA. Your daughter is right, and you're right to back her up. Your wife clearly knows nothing about burnout - she should do some research on the topic before she pushes your daughter into something bad for her that she'll have regrets about later on.", "NTA. She's been treated as older than her actual age her whole academic career so far.\n\nIf she's considered mature and clever enough to take the classes and pass the tests and get the grades, she should be trusted to make the right decision for her immediate future. Your wife is being a hypocrite.\n\nIt sounds to me like she's suffering from burnout, and I can tell you from experience that if she doesn't get some time off now there's a solid chance she'll flunk out of college because she won't be able to handle it.", "INFO have you thought about a post-grad (\"PG\") year at a boarding school? I'm talking about an academically oriented prep school, the kind designed to boost her chances of getting into a very exclusive college. I went to such a boarding school because my local public high school was... limited. It really was a chance to engage with other ~~nerds~~ students my own age; my parents felt comfortable because the environment is much more supervised than that of a typical college/university, since the students are all minors.", "NTA Take it from someone who skipped my junior year and started college at just-turned-17- don\u2019t go to college early. It\u2019s so isolating to be a child when everyone else is an adult. You miss out on so much of the social experience of dorm life and independent adulthood. I have several friends who skipped a grade along with me and NONE of us enjoyed college our first time around. We all ended up taking time off in the middle of our education, and one friend was so miserable she never went back to school despite being an exemplary honors student all through high school (we are now in our mid 30s so I don\u2019t think she will ever return). \n\nIf your wife insists she needs to keep her studies going, maybe she could take a class or two at community college and use the rest of her time to volunteer for an organization that is meaningful to her or work part time. You could also look into doing a post-graduate year at a private school so she is studying but still with people her age!\n\nEDIT- also, you are stealing two years of her childhood that she can\u2019t get back. Why rush being a grownup?", "NTA. When I was always studying and focusing on school my friends where having fun and traveling, making memories i didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t say study is a waste of time but having fun when you are young is also important. I burned out twice in my 20s because I was always working. Always. \n\nStressing your daughter out will likely make her hate studying. Also you can do useful things while still have a gap year. Maybe she could volunteer or travel the world. These experiences are also important and she is able to learn a lot as well.", "NTA but I would probably suggest a few general education courses online. It can be really hard to get back into the swing of things after a break. Everyone I know that took a break didn't actually go back to school for years after their original planned start date (if at all).", "NTA. She sounds completely burned out which is 100% understandable and frankly, expected. I'd encourage her to not get a job and just relax for the year. Focus on hobbies and enjoying her friends. She has the rest of her life to \"work\". At this point she needs to enjoy some time as a kid, that's way more important than any silly starter job. \n\nHer mom on the other hand sounds insane. Tell yoir wife to go get a second and third job of she thinks that level of stress is good for a teen. Maybe she should go back to school and learn a different launage. Let her know everytime she's watching TV or hanging out with a friend that she's \"wasting time\" and setting a bad example for your daughter. Flip the table on that noise.", "NTA. Regardless I just want to reassure you. My brother was in the same position. He was a recluse the last two years of secondary school, didn't have any friends. Finished secondary two years early, but he did go straight to university, so he was 16 in a group of 18 year olds. And sure, he was still regarded as a bit of a novelty but he completely changed and opened up. Finally, he was able to socialise with like-minded people, even if they were two years older. Sufdeni, he was thriving socially. So it is definitely possible. She'll get there!", "NTA. Regardless of her age or her reasons, I'd let her decide for herself. If she feels she isn't ready, I'd respect it.", "Let your daughter volunteer,or get a part time job.   Let her mature and interact with people her own age. Maybe she can wait a year and start with community College.  Speaking with a counselor could be helpful as a family.", "NTA. She should get a part time job during the year to start building that resume. She maybe able to find an internship in a field of interest.", "NTA. I work in a college/uni and I can tell you the younger ones often struggle. I'd advise her to do some studying in her gap year(s) so college isn't a shock to the system.", "My freshman year I shared a suit with a 16 year old and it was not a good situation for anyone involved", "NTA. I'm not a big fan of kids skipping multiple grades, especially once they get to college. Yeah, they might be extremely smart (sounds like your daughter is)... But that does NOTHING for their mental and emotional age. And going to college early, graduating college early, starting work early- none of that gets you other early social things. And those social things can be huge personal milestones or memories. \n\nMy college study group had VERY lively debates on the 2016 presidential election, because we could vote and it mattered. Your kid (probably, depends.on birthday) won't be able to vote next year. \n\nMy study group started going out and drinking and bar hopping on weekends when we were old enough. That'll never be her, since for US undergrad, she'll have graduated before that. \n\nFootball game tailgating? Forget it. \n\nOnce she starts working, she'll be what, 20? 21? So only barely old enough to grab drinks with coworkers after work, best case? Even if she doesn't drink, a lot of bars are 21+ no matter what. She'll always be \"the kid\" in the office. \n\nThose are just a few examples. There's more to both academic and professional success than *just* being smart.", "Oh definitely NTA. I was homeschooled and a LOT of my friends graduated early and started regular university. It was a train wreck in 90% of cases - kids weren\u2019t socially prepared for college, went crazy with the freedom, etc. A lot of them ended up dropping out or losing scholarships. I took community college classes in high school and that was the best thing for me to get more advanced material but still remain as a high school student.", "Life's not a race. She doesn't win anything by going to college early and stands to gain a lot by getting some non-academic experiences.\n\nVery much NTA.", "Hey OP! You\u2019re NTA. I wanted to share some insight as someone who left for college at 17. For one, I couldn\u2019t sign any of my own forms. If I needed something from the medical center at my college, I had to get a signed document from one of my parents before they could do/give anything to me. It wasn\u2019t great being denied pain relief medication because I was 17. I also got bounced around in the housing system because the housing department didn\u2019t want to stick me with adult aged students, which as you can imagine, is a hassle. This is not how it\u2019ll be at every college, but it\u2019s certainly a possibility.", "NTA\n\nSending a 16 year old into a pack of 18-23 year olds with minimal supervision isn't exactly the safest thing for your daughter.\n\nShe may be academically advanced, but she's still a 16 year old minor. Let her go to college at 18 like everyone else. She'll still be smart, she'll still be gifted, but she will finally be at the same emotional and physical development as her classmates. She'll be better for it.", "Yes. College is full of adults. Some very immature ones and some much older adults. I cannot imagine how one professor would have treated a literal child if the way he treated female students in general as less than was any indicator. She would probably struggle to make connections just as she did this year. She could still take some courses at a community college to keep her mind sharp if she wanted and get some gen.eds out of the way, but nothing bad will happen from taking a full year away from school like many people do when they graduate.", "I knew several people at Uni who said they wished they'd had a year off instead of back to back school. I had time off. It's a good thing. Working builds her CV so she'll have her degree plus work experience.  She'll have time to mentally rest and be fresh for Uni. Honestly, from experience, a year off is a great idea.", "One thing I might suggest OP, is seeing if there are some \u201cfun\u201d classes available at the local community college that she could take one or two of during the year- a language if she likes them, or even ASL, or perhaps a culinary or art class. And then look and see if there are any homeschool hang out groups that she could tap into for kids her age, or some intramural sports at the community center. Activities that are structured but give her space to just be a kid without having to figure it out completely on her own.", "Yes. I mentioned this in another comment, but it is so hard socially. I was not quite as young as OPs daughter, but was still always one of, if not the, youngest in my class. Obviously in high school, driving was the big thing. In college, a year or two might not sound so bad, but when a lot of people in the freshman class are turning 19 and you are still 17, it feels very awkward\u2014and on a college campus, there can easily be other undergrads who are 22 or 23.", "She's also not able to have the same freedoms or autonomy of the adults she'd be sharing classes with; developmentally, on a social level, she's at a disadvantage since she doesn't have the traditional 4 years of highschool worth of social experiences (even though most would love to forget these years exist they are crucial).", "[removed]", "Same. I finished but i struggled SO MUCH MORE than I needed to and it took longer", ">And the 2 year age gap is pretty large. 1 year is a lot more manageable.\n\nThis. Plus, at 17 in college, she would be in with kids that didn't skip *any* grades...and are still 17.", "This is a great idea. - Or, alternatively, if she has to graduate, could she take a university or college class or two? Dip her toes in a bit (as I imagine she is someone who is used to be busy and challenged, even if she needs to step back a bit for a break) without all the pressure. Usually there are work experience, co-op or exchange options that she could also use to \u201cextend\u201d her university experience a bit, while her peers catch up.", "Great suggestions, hope OP sees this...", "Yeah, I was going to suggest the same, have her pick up a course per semester for the year & maybe a hobby/club or two as well, so she can get stay engaged & socialized.  Maybe volunteering for something related to her future career?", "Maybe she needs a break from education for a year, for her mental health. She might be burnt out, and working more is just going to make it worse.", "she needs chances to learn about life not get shoved in more 'fill in' classes.  She is finishing high school early, she has no problem with actual education and would be rolling her eyes at most community college offerings.", "I like this idea. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s all or nothing\u2026 take just one or two easy GE or elective classes at a local college instead of jumping into full time units. That way she chips away at a couple classes, and eases her way into college routine at the same time.", "I started college when I was 27, I was by no means the norm but on the other hand in my year and subject I was not the oldest. In fact I was fourth oldest in a group of 80. Oldest being a lady in her early 40s", "Exactly! \n\nAnd OP and daughter both sound like the expectation is to work, find friends and hobbies that will help her going forward, and just be a happier productive person.", "That is equally true. I guess my suggestion was just based on keeping the mom off her back while she takes a much needed break. \n\nIn the end, she is clearly highly intelligent, and her choice to take a year off should be respected. I'm sorry I didn't make that as clear in my post as I should have. Generally, when I hear \"gap year,\" I think of travel, and at 16 she wouldn't be doing much of that."]}
