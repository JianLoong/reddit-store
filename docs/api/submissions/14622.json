She's always been very gifted academically, and since 3rd grade was a year ahead in school. We always made sure she wasn't too overstressed, and made sure she was still having time to be a kid, we didn't want her to end up burning out. Overall she was quite happy and seemed to be in a good place until last year.\n\nShe was a sophmore, but the school said her grades were good enough to skip another year, and go stright to senior year. She was hesitant, but they said it would be good for her development and so we decided to move her up, which I regret. She still got good grades, but was very stressed and busy. She has a great work ethic, but sometimes I think it causes her to put more effort than is healthy into her work. She was tired, less outgoing, and generall more down. She had a hard time getting along with the older kids, and never made any new friends. The worst part was she skipped junior prom, and had nobody she even knew to go to senior with.\n\nSo she's graduating this year, and explained that she doesn't want to go to college next year. I get her reasoning, she'll be much younger, and sharing classes with much older adults. She thinks she overdid it (it isn't her fault but she thinks otherwise) skipping two grades and wants to just relax. She said she's sick of never getting to spend much time with people her age, and wants to age into college a bit. She's willing to work and stay busy this next year, but doesn't want to do college yet.\n\nI think it's the right call, she's still a kid, and will have more time to enjoy it. I'm honestly more worried about her socially than academically, all the degrees in the world won't matter if she can't talk to anybody. My wife disagrees, and thinks she'll waste the entire year when she could be studying.

But it is at that age. Being mindful of your daughter's mental well-being does not make you a \"fun parent\" it makes you a caring parent. Since your daughter seem to be feeling depressed/burnt out I would recommend you sanding your ground. Her academic possibilities won't diminish from waiting a year.", "NTA\n\nYou are recognizing the early signs of burn out for your daughter. If you were to \"force\" her into college now, it would just get worse. \n\nGood on you for taking mental health seriously. \n\nMANY adults take a gap year to recharge mentally, and because she is 2 years ahead, after her gap year she will still be one year ahead. Win win for everyone.", "NTA - you're not being a \"fun parent,\" (not to say you aren't fun lol) you're caring for your daughter's health! People shouldn't work themselves to death, yk? It's reasonable to take a break. Heck, think of all the stuff she could do in that year: make new friends, find job opportunities, find new hobbies, exploring what she wants to do with herself and her future, probably much more. Not wasting time at all, imo! Caring about your daughter's well-being is caring about her future. All that work is gonna go to waste if she's too burnt out to take care of herself, and that's obv going to affect her work as well. People need breaks!!", "I'm going to say NTA.\n\nI have a child who is in a very similar position, and is about to graduate at fifteen. She wants to spend a couple of years working, and building up some savings before starting college, and honestly I agree with her. Not just because it will give her a chance to age into the college she wants to attend, but because it will give her an idea of what real world responsibilities look like, and a chance to build up some savings for herself before she really enters the real world on her own. So my personal opinion is definitely NTA.", "NTA. \n\nSo she finishes University early too? then what? Works till 65 or retires 2 years earlier than her peers? What's the end goal with rushing through it all? \n\nPersonally, I think the journey should be enjoyed just as much as the finish line.", "NTA...So what if she wastes her entire year instead of studying?  Your daughter is politely telling you that she's not ready.  You obviously got the message--good on you.", "NTA.\n\n16 is too young for a university setting. You sound like you're from the US, but even where I'm from there's quite the difference between the way 16 year olds and 18 year olds act. \n\nGap years are also awesome.\n\nEven if she was 18+ I'd say have a gap year!", "As someone who graduated at 16,i say NTA. I wish I'd taken a gap year or 2 rather than jumping right in. I might have actually stuck with college instead of dropping out.", "NTA. Your daughter is burning out, and you have a chance to support her or put more pressure on her. A 16 year old is going to struggle socially in a traditional college setting, and will be more vulnerable to manipulation by sketchy people. Your daughter having an extra year of studying isn't going to help her if she's too burnt out to continue the next year. She can take some time off to work and destress, then decide how she wants to proceed. Good for you for supporting her.", "NTA but your wife is! She's 16 years old and has achieved a lot academically, but yes, she has completely suffered in her social life, which to a teenager is almost everything. She deserves to be rewarded and have at least one year off! And then reevaluate where she's at, at the end of that year. Please do what's best for her, she's honestly earned it!", "NTA.\n\nI agree with her and you. Far too many gifted students burn out. She can afford to pace herself. Whatever she chooses, it hardly sounds like she's going to be a failure in life. There seems to be a lot of pressure on her to overachieve here.\n\nAnd the 2 year age gap is pretty large. 1 year is a lot more manageable. \n\nFinally, a gap year offers a lot of opportunity for personal development. I suggest encouraging her to think about what she wants to do but aside from that, go for it.", "NTA. Does she have to graduate? If she has met all her requirements, is it possible to go half day to high school classes that are focused on enrichment and enjoyment.\n\nLots of our seniors go half day their senior year and just take their music or art classes. \n\nAfter all the work that got them there, it is a break for them to focus on the fun parts of high school that they missed earlier. A lot also do internships or volunteering part of the day so they are more well rounded.\n\nA gap year is fine too if that is what they really want to do!", "NTA - based on your description, it sounds like the mental peace that a year off would bring her is well worth the price of delaying college by a year. Living a balanced life is so much more important than dominating in one specific area (i.e. academics).\n\nMaybe a \"selling point\" to your wife could be for her to use this year to catch up on some of the things she missed out on while focusing too hard on academics - i.e. social development, health habits. Rather than characterizing it as just relaxing and lounging around for a year.", "NTA. You DO care about your daughter's future, which is why you're making sure that mentally, she's ready for college. Your daughter is telling both of you how she feels. It seems you're the only one listening.", "NTA. You need to put your daughter's wellbeing first.", "NTA!\n\nBurnout is a real thing and they are going to be burnt out so fast.  She is still going to be ahead.  No issues with letting her take off. Good for you for listening to her.", "**NTA** \n\nThere is absolutely nothing that she is missing out on by taking a year off. She's 16, she needs time to be a kid with other kids and to reflect on what she actually wants to do in school.\n\nWhat would be a waste is for her to jump right into college, spend several years in a track she eventually decides she hates, and then quit or switches to something else. Or worse, she gets a degree in something she doesn't want to do and ends up not using it.\n\nTbh, she graduated two years early, I'd tell her to take two years. I'd consider telling her that she needs to be *doing* something during that time - volunteering, working, whatever. But that's an educational experience all on its own. The real world is a place she's going to need to exist in and spending a year or two working or volunteering and interacting with that real world is learning.\n\nYou can frame it to your wife as this *is* your daughter studying, just studying how to be a functional adult.", "NTA. It's just as important for your daughter to be emotionally and socially ready as it is for her to be academically qualified. She realizes that she needs more socializing and should be enabled to work on that. It might help for you, your wife and your daughter to talk to a counsellor about a plan to ready her for college. Your daughter needs to well rounded in all areas to be successful. Good grades alone won't make her happy or fulfilled. Good job parenting to realize this and help her.", "NTA, your daughter's opinion is the most important one here and the worst thing would be to burn her out. Your wife needs to take a step back and really listen to your daughter - while your wife's concerns about \"wasting the year\" might be valid in a way, this can also be a really enriching year if it plays out right.\n\nOne thing your daughter might consider is not going all-in on the gap year. Maybe pick up just one or two courses at a local community college and working a part time job to keep her sharp and engaged (both academically and socially).", "NTA. Your daughter needs time to just be a kid and relax. I'd honestly wait and let her relax before going and working.", "I think you really do have your daughters future to heart. It's not only about academics. \n\nAnd I think you are a great dad who truly listens to his daughter.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I went to college a year early and it is the biggest regret of my life. I was ready academically, I was ***not*** ready emotionally/mentally. I was entirely too immature, went crazy with the new-found freedom, partied WAY too much and ended up withdrawing after one semester to keep from failing out. I never went back. Your daughter is being smart about this, listen to her.", "NTA for two reasons; one, burnout is real, and by what you describe it sounds like she is absolutely burnt out, which is no way to start college. Secondly even that aside; whether she goes to college at all and when should be *her* choice, you letting her make the choice that's right to her instead of forcing her to do something she doesn't want to do is the right call.\n\nCollege is going to be the start of her making her own decisions as an adult, don't have her first adult decision be one you make for her against her will.", "NTA. I skipped two years and graduated at 16.  I finished grad school by 21.  I don\u2019t regret it, but I definitely outgrew my friends in high school and college.  It doesn\u2019t help I am a loner by nature.\n\nYou let her get so far ahead because she was responsible and mature enough to handle it.  Why are you questioning her judgment now?\n\nMy suggestion would be to let her get a year\u2019s part time working experience with an emphasis on saving.  See if she can get an entry level position or volunteer hours in a field she might be interested in.  What really helped me was Girl Scouts and drama club. My best friend\u2019s mom basically turned girl scouts into a social club for the five of us.", "NTA - Seems pretty obvious to me.  She is immature (not for her age, for her grade level) and should be given a chance to catch up.  Also, she should have a chance to be a person, not a studying machine.", "NTA. She's going to be in uni with people at least 2 years older than her and that will be hard. It sounds a sensible idea. Many teens have a gap year before uni even if they aren't advanced so I think your wife is overreacting quite a bit.", "In this case, a gap year sounds like a great idea. Has she thought about maybe taking a class or two at a community college, if she wants to keep her study skills sharp? It\u2019s possible she could get transfer credit for it when she does go to college.", "NTA but doing nothing shouldn\u2019t be an option either.  Is there a community college where she can take \u201cfun classes\u201d like ceramics and art appreciation part time?  Something fun but still in an academic setting so she doesn\u2019t lose her edge.  Alternatively, she could work somewhere.  My only point is that she shouldn\u2019t do nothing.  That said, I fully agree with her taking 1-2 years off before college.  She\u2019s still very young.", "NTA - she deserves to decompress. I don't think she'd be very happy going straight into college. She's already feeling stressed and vulnerable. Also her working while she take the gap isn't wasting her time. She'll improve her social skills and make some money while doing it. It's ultimately her decision not you or your wife's. Stick to you instinct and support her. This isn't about being the \"fun parent\" this is about what's best for your daughter and her mental health.", "Nta. Taking a gap year is an excellent idea, if your wife is that worried, she can agree to save x amount of her wages a month to go towards costs, or some other target to ensure she's not simply wasting the time. But your daughter won't have any fun when she's too young to take part in activities with her peers, she will struggle socially from that, and as she already feels the pressure from the previous year, it's a good idea to take the year to refresh, recharge, and mature a bit and be in a level playing field with her peers.", "I'm with you on this one. She needs to slow down, or her future is filed with high electable of herself that she'll never be able to keep up with, which will lead to depression and feelings of worthlessness. Let her learn to relax before she grows up to think she's not allowed.", "NTA- gap year is usually a good thing and forcing her into college is never the answer. LIFE is never a waste, she will be working, she will be seeing how things function and this will also help her see what she wants to do with her future.  Studying isnt the answer for everything.", "NTA. She said she will work, so she won't be wasting the year, right? Having some experience working before starting collage is great, it gives you more to go on regarding your future career. That's a great way to get some use out of having finished school early, while it also gives her some time to focus on other things than studying, which she seems to need. Your wife is the AH.", "NTA - Her mental health will take a blow that could take years to recover from if she continues on to college. Things will just get ever more unpleasant for her. You're suggesting the right thing.", "NTA. She worked hard and deserves a rest. Also this year  could be not wasted time but she could figure out what does she like the most", "NTA soooo much. You do her best. And she seems to be aware of the disadvantages of being gifted. With that she has a great future ahead! \n\nWhat is a year compared to a live time that is ahead of her?", "Speaking as the mom of a college student 100% NTA. Your wife on the other hand is a total AH. If she thinks your daughter is mature enough to go off to college she should also think she is mature enough to make her own decisions regarding her life. Thank you for standing up for your kid.", "I was your daughter in school (though I only skipped one year, I was already one of the youngest kids in my grade, so effectively 2 years younger). I also played 3 varsity sports and had a part time job.\n\nWhen I got to college, I played college basketball (D3, not a scholarship, but still, lots of time commitment) and had no idea what to do in college. I tried like 5 different majors and did okay, but couldn't pick one and ultimately quit basketball and got depressed and dropped out for a year and a half back at home working a couple shitty retail jobs and living in a shared apartment.\n\nOnly then did I appreciate school and figure out what I wanted to do, and honestly, that's not even that common. I think a year off would be good for her, BUT, I would try to have some kind of plan and not just spend a year doing nothing.\n\nMaybe she could try to do an internship or work and save money? Perhaps you guys could travel a bit with her (she's a bit young to send off to europe by herself) or do something out of the norm. Are there any interests she's wanted to dive into that she's never had time for (like learning to sail or ride horses or whatever?) that she could kind of dive into?\n\nBut I think that's the answer, she clearly looks like she's burning out a bit, and college is going to be REAL awkward if she's turning 17 and everyone else is 18+.", "I'd like to add that if you're worried about her, talk to her about her mental health, ask how she's actually doing, since you've noticed some changes. If she's truly not doing well, make sure she gets assessed by a mental health professional. Not saying she's necessarily mentally ill, just that burnout is an issue that should be taken seriously. And it's good to help her get in the habit of checking in with herself regarding how she's doing since she seems like the type that could easily end up burnt out.", "NAH\n\nI respect you listening to your daughter and her needs. I echo the comment about half-days at school without graduating. Taking some of those fun classes could still be a good way for her to figure out what she wants in life, take it easy, and have some friends her age. University would be way too intense for someone her age who's still trying to grow and mature.", "NTA and a gap year doesn't have to be sitting around. I took a gap year between high school and college and spent that time volunteering each week at the local animal shelter and taking \"for fun\" (not translating to what I wanted my major to be, chosen because of my interest in them) classes at the local community college.", "NTA. Your wife seriously needs to re-assess what counts as being for the good of your daughter's future. College is not just about academics, but also for learning how to socialize and network. \n\nYour daughter has a good head on her shoulders. The last thing you want to do is break her mentally by placing her in a situation where she knows she struggles to fit in.\n\nFurthermore, many top-performing students take a gap year either before college or grad school or career. There are many life-broadening experiences one can strive to partake in during a gap year. So I wholely reject the idea that a gap year is necessarily a waste of a year.", "NTA. at all. Consider a year of volunteering and no pressure side classes that interest her. She's not an adult yet so I think she should be allowed to enjoy her childhood before it's gone. If she's smart and academically motivated, she'll find a non structured way to continue learning something during that gap year.", "NTA!  I remember when I was a senior in college, we had this extremely bright guy who was in the newspapers for finishing high school at 15.  His problem was that all of us were 20/21 and he was 17.  He was friendly and all, but he couldn't connect with anyone.  Those are years when people are changing quickly and having some emotional maturity is a huge benefit.  Tell her to get a job, see how other teenagers live, go on some dates, etc.  She'll be better off for it.", "NTA.  I went to college at 16, and I regret it.  Honestly, I don\u2019t regret graduating early, because half my classes were community college by that time anyway.  But I was too young to be on my own and responsible for my education (not that I would have been willing to admit that at the time), and I almost ruined a first class education.\n\nNow I am a professor, and the students who have the problems are often those who just went to university because \u201cit was the thing to do next.\u201d  People should go to university because there is something they want there (want a lot).\n\nYou are being a good mom.", "NTA.\n\n16 to 18 or 19 is a HUGE age gap from a social and life experience perspective.\n\nGetting a job, volunteering, whatever for a year (or 2) might even help with selecting or confirming her course of study.", "NTA, but a 16, she isn't going to have much she will be able to do in a gap year. Perhaps you can split the baby, and she can take a class or two at the community college. That way, she still has plenty of time off and is still working on her education.", "NAH - there isn't a lot of context here, but I see both sides of this argument. Your daughter DOES need a break, but have you discussed what happens after the gap year or the two year gap years and I think that's where your wife's mind is at. What happens if that gap year stretches until she's in her mid-20s? Do you guys have a plan? Also I don't see her calling you the fun parent out of nowhere and there is probably more to that than what we are getting. However, that is more of a side bar. I don't see either parent being assholes here as they both have the kid's future in mind.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And you are thinking of her future. Burnout is very real. Maybe compromise and suggest she takes a class at a community College.", "NTA - It is vitally important to listen to your daughter. \n\nYour wife's approach, ramping up the speed & incline of your daughter's life, is not healthy and to what ends? A FastPass through Disney is fine but not through life. Your daughter has already lived & articulated the down sides. Celebrate her successes and allow her to create and explore a cool year; she earned it!", "NTA you're right. If your wife values education so much, she should learn about brain development. Your daughter's instincts are good.", "NTA\n\nA couple of years make a much bigger difference socially at that age than when you're just younger or a fair bit older. You need extra confidence not less to do well away from home with that older crowd. \n\nCan you find something for her gap year which allows her to build digital confidence?\n\nA volunteer trip abroad, or something like that?", "I didn't skip grades, but I was too focused on grades in high school, had only one friend, no dates and was too emotionally immature when I got to college. I never really got my life on track. Don't do that to your daughter; gifted children often turn into burned out adults. You're NTA for letting her relax and mature before college. You don't want her to come home pregnant at 17.", "NTA. I started college at 17, and it sucked being the only one who couldn't participate in things (drinking age is 18 here). I also question the wisdom of dropping a poorly socialized underage girl into frat boy territory. \n\nIs there a compromise? Could she do an exchange year and retake her senior year abroad? Grades don't matter much in a post-grad exchange, and she can get some life experience, learn a language, and have some fun so she doesn't burn out in college.", "NTA.  Even for 18 year old seniors, it would be reasonable to take a gap year prior to college.  Also, whatever topic she is interested in, she could study it independently.  It doesn't mean her study skills will atrophy over 1-2 years.  Also, it sounds like she needs a break from the rat race of school.\n\nIf it's an issue of getting into the best college, I cannot say how undergraduate will view such gap years, but I can tell you that for medical school, it is not viewed negatveily.", "NTA. How about a student exchange year in another country so she can learn or improve a second or third language? I was 16 when I graduated in the US and then did 12th and 13th grade in Germany and then graduated there too. Then I did a gap year and started studying at 19.", "NAH  I agree with both of you, despite how gifted your daughter is she must've been working hard to pull that off so yes, she deserves some downtime. But she also shouldn't lose her momentum- your wife is right too. What if your daughter took 6 months off and then the next 6 months take 2 or 3 online classes instead of a full class load. The next year she'd only be a year younger. My mother did the same thing by the way, she graduated with a 4.0 at 16 and got sent away to college. She completed one year and then ran home and married her 18 year old alcoholic boyfriend. I think she was too young and ran back to what she considered was safe. It was not. Sit down with your daughter and have a real conversation with her - she may be academically old enough for college but emotionally theres a huge difference between college and high school.", "NTA. I was homeschooled and my parents pushed me to finish early and start university at 16. I was burnt out and not ready. My first year was a terrible experience and I took an extra year to finish because I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do for awhile and didn\u2019t want to be there. Now all is well, I have a degree and a good career but a gap year would have been so much better. \n\nIf your wife is really worried she\u2019ll get out of the habit of school and not want to go back, maybe suggest to your daughter she take an easy class or two at the community college that will knock out some core requirements for when she does go to a four year school, and maybe help her ease into to college work. But also a break is totally fine - she sounds burnt out and if she goes for a full college load immediately the chances of her dropping out are much higher", "NTA, it seems like you're the only one looking out for your daughter's wellbeing here. You're already seeing the effects of her skipping grades, and it will only get worse if she starts college so early. Your wife needs to stop living vicariously through her daughter and instead start prioritizing her mental health. Let her be a kid, there's no need to rush her into adulthood.", "NTA. Struggling in her first year of college because she's still burnt out from accelerated high school, doesn't really want to be there, and feels socially isolated among much-older peers is not going to be great for your daughter's future, either.\n\nThis is your daughter's decision, ultimately -- and delaying college for a year while she figures herself out is frankly a very mature one for her to make.", "NTA. I also skipped two grades and ended up in college at 16. Even though I was in state and lived on campus it was still a huge pain. I couldn't join any club or class activities that went over the state line without explicit permission from my parents. On campus food services that served alcohol couldn't let me in to eat after a certain time of the evening, which sucked a lot because I had lab classes that ran late. Let her take the year off, and if your wife is that concerned, maybe she can knock out some part-time classes at the local community college.", "Your daughter is absolutely brilliant and completely in the right here. Honestly she\u2019s demonstrating considerable maturity in this decision. NTA at all.", "I think you are right. She would be severely limited in social activities at college at 16. You have to be 18 to do most things, and you won't be there to give permission further stunting her growth. She needs a year to work on her mental health and social growth or she won't succeed in college much less in life. Without good social skills, she just won't make it.

I would just let her be a kid for a bit.

Encourage her to join groups where she can meet other people her age so she can socialize and make some friends her age. She might be gifted academically, but kids like her can be stunted in the social-emotional department, so encouraging social activities will be good for her! Then when she is ready to attend college/university, she will be a well-rounded individual who can handle all the stresses of modern collegiate life. \n\nIf she is forced to go, she will likely burn out in a year or two and ultimately quit.

I did not do well my freshman year, despite being theoretically well prepared.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know for sure, but I think I had taken a gap year, I probably would have gone for a PhD. Professors were pushing me for it, offering letters of recommendation, etc., but by the time I could see college graduation as being reasonably close, I couldn\u2019t stomach the idea of the GRE and five more years of school (biology).

I really enjoyed the Kahn Academy art history classes. I'd never have taken such a course in college myself so now that I'm an adult out of school I can still \"keep fresh\" with such things. Very in depth but not so much I couldn't follow along. And it for sure gave me a better understanding and appreciation when I go to museums and see stuff from the courses.", "NTA. A gap year or two is definitely the way to go! And it's not Luke she just has to sit around for 2 years doing nothing, she could take a some online classes to get the gen Ed requirements done, do some volunteering or get a job, or even still go to high school for part of the day. My senior year classes consisted of choir, film, and various electives because I all I needed was a single English credit to graduate. It was fun at the time!", "NTA I skipped ahead in school and started college at 17. I burned out fast and dropped out after my first year with an embarrassingly low GPA for someone who graduated high school with honors and a perfect 5.0\n\nI wish I\u2019d had the sense to wait, or a parent who was more concerned with my well being than degrees.", "Most definitely NTA. I knew a kid in college who came in early at 17. I've never felt more sympathy for him than I have for almost anyone else. He didn't know how to talk to his fellow classmates, or professors, or just...anyone. He didn't get a chance to develop the social skills most kids do in high school that translate into becoming an adult and it showed.\n\nI'm not a parent, but if I had a kid who graduated that early and wanted to take some time to relax and refresh and be a young person, I'd be behind that 100%. Very few ADULTS are that self aware, so when an incredibly smart kid says it, I'd try and listen.", "NTA! Doesn't your wife know how many people take gap years prior to uni? Sooo many! Whether it's to work and save up a bit (because studying ain't cheap), to go travelling or just to have a break. It's not laziness, it's self care. And I'm talking about 18 and 19 year olds who studied at the usual pace, not someone who qualified two years early. Your daughter's achievements are impressive but she's a human being and needs to take a breather. You're a great dad for listening to her and caring.", "NTA, if your wife is worried about her not doing anything, maybe your daughter could look into studying a language for the year?\n\nYou could even make it an experience, she works part time, takes a language course at a community college or something and then she can travel and spend some time in a country that speaks the language.\n\nIt\u2019s educational but also fun, and something she can put on a college application", "Just as important as your daughter's future is her present. Giving her a gap year can allow her to enjoy both to the fullest. NTA", "NTA for judgement. Commenting to give some advice because I hope you see it.\n\nAsymmetrical development is common in children who are gifted/talented or neurodivergent. I do not know if your daughter is the latter, but she is certainly the former. A brief way to explain this is your daughter is an adult in academic intelligence and development, but may be elsewhere on the spectrum with other aspects. There are resources on this. \n\nChildren who are this significantly asymmetric usually have a difficult time with social interactions. She is 16, and while she has the intellect of an adult, she likely does not have the social skills of one. She is not likely to have much in common with her university peers, just as she probably thinks ahe has very little in common with her school age peers. Just to point out another social aspect... It does not sound like she has much experience with dating. I urge you to sit down with your daughter and talk about being careful with people who may target her based on age and inexperience. Many people recommend the book \"The Gift of Fear.\" She is not stupid, far from it. People are just unfortunate.\n\nI agree with you that your daughter needs a break. It stands out to me that you said your daughter was overwhelmed and stressed when she had challenges. Please talk to her about burning out and how to handle feeling overwhelmed. Some gifted children who do not struggle much academically in lower grades crash hard when they are significantly challenged in college. Her grades are not the true measure of who she is and there is never any shame in asking for help. \n\nA gap year would be good for her. Some people suggested community college courses, and that is an excellent idea. Just some fun classes to learn a skill or try something. Ask her about something she has wanted to try and see if she can do a sport, take a class, volunteer, or just do something that she finds exciting.\n\nGood luck.", "Person who started college early for my age here. Continue listening to your daughter!", "NTA- She may be academically ready for college, but she is not socially or emotionally ready for college. She is still a teenager, a minor, and college freshman are going into adulthood. College is not all about the academics. She will be too young for all of the social aspects of college, and unable to enjoy any of it. \n\nMaybe a compromise would be for her to take 1 community college course during this break so she can still be \u201cstudying\u201d but also give her the opportunity to hang out with kids her own age. Let her join some clubs or activities. Maybe take some art or music classes. Join a sports team. She could volunteer. It doesn\u2019t have to be a waisted year in your wife\u2019s eyes, but can also give her the time she needs to grow a little before jumping into the future. College is not a race! She has plenty of time.", "Have her think about doing a study abroad year. If it's with a program like Rotary then it won't cost more than a plane ticket. She'll get ten months in a whole new culture and learn a new language pretty easily and will still officially be a part of her graduating class (she'll need to still be enrolled at her high school for the program even if she's fulfilled the credit requirements for graduation)", "NTA - I think a gap year is great for any kid, regardless of age. It'll give her time to consider what she wants to do! As someone who wishes they took a gap year, I say encourage her to pursue some sort of internship in a field she's interested in (low pressure at this age but still gives exposure to the field) and maybe even look into an opportunity for her to travel! This is such a fabulous opportunity", "NAH - there is a compromise somewhere in the middle. Can she knock out some general education requirements at a local community college while working either full or part time? I'd personally be rather hesitant to send a 16 year old to live at college. By the time she is ready to go to a four-year school she will be almost 18 - more age appropriate with her peers. \n\nIt would be great if there could be some travel experiences planned as part of her gap year - education doesn't only come from a classroom.", "NTA. At this age the 2 yr age gap is huge. A lot of college is socializing (drinking, hook ups, doing stupid stuff you never got a chance to do while at school and living with parents etc). She\u2019s way too young for this and if she doesn\u2019t feel like she can fit in, this can cause a whole lot of other mental health issues. The workload is also a while other topic. Let her have a gap year, even two. Her fitting in and being the age and maturity of her peers is more important than academics.", "NTA\n\nThe high school did her a disservice in my opinion. Instead of finding a way to keep her stimulated through independent study or online college courses they tried to push her out of publicly paid for schooling early. Likely because it saved them money and effort. \n\nI just don't believe  that there were no more AP classes for her to take or self study. That class list is like a mile long.", "NTA.

As someone knew kids who did go to college early, all of them felt like they could have waited. Every single one, even (especially!) the more introverted ones. \n\nAnd even the less introverted ones, kids who were better at making friends, were still invited to fewer parties, never really got to go out with friends or party because they were sometimes too young to be considered inviting. It's one thing if they're not 21 yet; it's a whole 'nother ballpark if you're not even 18 and are still getting carded at movie theaters-- and that's a direct anecdote, I once chaperoned a brilliant fellow freshman student from Cameroon or something with a small group, because he literally got turned away the first time because he was 16 and he had wanted to see an R-rated film by himself.", "NTA. I didn't skip grades technically until maybe college (went into college with 30 some credit hours). I worked hard for that. I don't regret it. I also did dual credit at my community college. At times I was the only dual credit student. No one minded, but it felt odd when I brought in Girl Scout cookies (couldn't leave them in the car) to class. For several weeks. In a row. \n\nMaybe let her do a gen-ed if she wants to or something like an elective at the college. If it's a community college, ask when the dual credit/enrollment classes typically are held and try and get her into one of those. The professors are aware young students are in those if not the whole class. Go at her pace. I don't regret doing dual credit, but I also don't think it was always good for me", "NTA. I took a gap year after high school. As one of the youngest in my year I just didn\u2019t feel ready to go to university. I did part time jobs and i backpacked for 3 months.

I failed, badly, and my first two years were basically wasted money until I took some time away and went again in my early 20s.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the work, or the difficulty of study, or anything like that, it was the sudden shift of accountability putting everything on my shoulders as to whether or not I would succeed. Which included pressure from family and a lack of people my age I could talk to at school.\n\nCongrats to your daughter for having the aptitude to get through high school faster than most, that\u2019s a great achievement, but the fact she recognizes she will need time to adjust before going on to higher learning is even more valuable.\n\nI would definitely suggest a sit down with her to plan for hire and when she\u2019ll actually go, even if nothing is concrete, just to keep that goal in mind, but she\u2019s certainly earned some time off from her studies. \n\nGetting to move on to college with her friends, even if they go to different schools, will help her deal with the pressure since she\u2019ll have peers going through the same thing to talk to.", "NTA. \n\nHas she considered being an exchange student?\n\nI did that the year after I graduated high school before I started college. It gave me a break before college, BUT I was still learning lots of things (language, culture, living with another family) in addition to attending high school in another country, but in a lower stress situation as my grades didn\u2019t matter since I\u2019d already graduated. \n\nI learned SO much about myself it really helped with the social aspects of going to college (independence, home sickness).

Take a year off, enjoy being a teenager, and them jump into college.", "NTA and I'd also agree with the kid. If she had issues with senior students, there's no way she'll fit in in college.

The red flags are already there: she is an academic achiever, and has been trained to rely on her academic success for her self worth. The more she travels along this road, the worse it will be.

Those who could deal with that succeeded. Those who didn't....well, they dropped out. One way or another. \n\nThe best thing that could happen to her now is encouraging her to get a regular, non-academic job--one that she applies for herself, works at, and brings home a paycheck.  She will learn she can get a job without being the top student, and people will value her for her hard work, not just being \"smart.\" That will give her independence,  teach her self reliance, and ultimately provide her the freedom in life to walk away.\n\nThe problem with relying on \"being smart\" is that it gives you no control--if you fail, you can't make yourself \"smarter\". So you are desperately afraid of failure.  It's a horrible way to live. \n\nWhen she is 30, no one will care if she started university at 16 or 18.

She can get an idea of what real life is like and make her academic future decisions based off of actual things she's experienced rather than \"I'm going to college because this is what I've always expected to do!\"  Graduating aged 21 (or, horror, 22) instead of at 20 is going to make zero difference in the long term, and you are NTA.", "nta. as somebody who was gifted and burned out (for a different reason but wtvr) recovering from burnout is hard, especially in college. i wish i\u2019d taken a gap year, but instead i\u2019m failing (completely) my freshman year and wasting money. let her step back and relax. let her enjoy herself.", "A gap year is a great opportunity to do something fun! She can volunteer, join clubs, take free classes, etc. As long as it's not a full time job it can also help with burnout (by providing a way to socialize without the expectations of performing well). You can pitch it to your wife by saying it'll make her college applications stronger (but that shouldn't be the real purpose)", "One thing she might consider is taking community college courses (online or in-person) in subjects that she has a genuine interest in exploring. While working may be able to give her valuable experience if she can get a job somewhere good, she may get more value from taking classes in non-degree required courses that provide her some value (artistic, vocational, exploratory, etc.). It also can be a great transition that provides familiarity with the formatting of college level courses without many of the pressures placed upon young students at university (especially if taken in the online format, and/or in pass/no pass option)", "Agreed.\n\nYour daughter may be academically advanced but social maturity really matters in college. \n\nPlus she has already expressed frustration in missing major social milestones with people her age. \n\nAlso you are right to worry about a 16 year old alone on campus with adults. That sounds like a real bad idea.", "Besides, maybe a year off to find out more about herself and start acclimating to the real world is a good reward for her having worked so hard to finish school early.\n\nIt's not like she'll lose the ability to go later in life, but she WILL lose the ability to take this gap year if she immediately jumps into college/work.\n\nI really like that OP has a good enough relationship with their child that they're able to have these kinds of discussions. A kid whose identity has been tied to academic success for so long isn't likely to forget how to be industrious just because she took a year off, and having the responsibility to do so likely means she has better insight into her well being than others her age.", "Journey before destination.", "I used to be for having kids start school the first year of eligibility, but changed my mind for the reason you said.  If you can gift your kid an extra year of childhood then do it.  There is no reason to push them out ahead of schedule", "This sounds like a fantastic idea, because then OP\u2019s daughter could potentially spend more time bonding and socializing with her classmates (that was one of the things she regretted right? Missing out on the social aspect?)", "Agree - she needs a breather, and taking some time before college is the right choice. At the same time, she still needs structure and direction. Pursuing a new passion/interest (without overdoing it!!) sounds just right. \n\n(NTA)", "The only thing is...and I don't know if it matters to OPs daughter, I kind of doubt it will. But taking community college classes might knock you out of some merit scholarships at some colleges. Just something to look into before she takes any classes.", "I think this is a good idea! I took college classes at the community college while in high school, and was treated respectfully. It's too bad OP's daughter couldn't do what we called post secondary options, and have her college classes all paid for.", "Yes, I completely agree... Anyway NTA. \n\nMaybe an approach for your wife could be, if your daughter was mature enough to visit college, she should also be considered mature enough to decline the option and spend the year otherwise. Also working a job can teach your daughter much more valuable life lessons than going to college early. Maybe that helps.\n\nEdit for typos", "As someone who combined junior and senior year, and headed to college at 17, it's also difficult to just do things in college because a lot of it isn't geared for your age.  Like, most clubs I wanted to join had waivers that needed to be signed (which I couldn't do because I was underage), so I had to wait until I went home to get my parents to sign before I could participate.  The other students had a tendency to try to treat me with kid gloves, which got frustrating, and it's a lot harder to hang out when many off-campus hangouts have 18+ restrictions.  Going early worked for me (I was a social pariah who finally found my people), but even the basics of socializing and navigating school were a challenge.", "Yep. Give her the year. Have her get a little job and take a class or two, maybe something fun, so she doesn't lose the habit of studenting. Challenge her to make a new friend at the pizza joint or wherever she's working, or to join a community group.", "Or a few gen ed classes online. Volunteering in something she finds interesting will help her socially a lot", "Agreed, I wish I\u2019d taken time off to work a bit and then travel before uni. Would have been nice to have a break from being in a studying environment", "Not to mention the guys, even freshmen, will be older and will see her coming a mile away. If I were her parent I'd be terrified for her.", "Yep. I was younger than a lot of people in my grade- I literally turned 18 the day before I moved into my dorm freshman year. I didn\u2019t skip any grades, just have a late birthday, but there\u2019s an almost 2 year age gap between me and some of my friends that are only 1 year ahead of me. I think letting her have a break after working so hard and letting her get a little older before college is wise.", "Yes! If there's a local community college where OP is, letting her take a class or two could help give her some daily structure/routine while also possibly giving her transfer credits she could apply to a four-year university in two years", "I think the bigger reason people are so all or nothing for college is the money. Most of the time you don\u2019t qualify for financial aid or scholarships if you aren\u2019t a full time student. Most community colleges are fairly inexpensive (I think one of my local ones is only $75 per credit hour), but OP\u2019s financial situation is unknown and could be part of what\u2019s influencing their decision too. I agree though, community college might be a good idea for her so she doesn\u2019t go a whole year with no school or learning at all", "CC is a great way to start.  I got my first two years done at a local CC and the cost was about 1/3 of the State University I got my four-year degree in.  The best part of the CC is the classes were a lot smaller and helped me transition from a small-town highs school to college."]}
