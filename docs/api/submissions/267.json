Miles has difficulty with crowd and loud noises which make her very uncomfortable and anxious. \n\nThis would be fine but the band is well known for having fans faint because of heat and/or noise, so Miles would be extremely uncomfortable the whole time she was there. \n\nI know that she gonna feel like shit at the concert and that there is a big chance she will want to leave but I don\u2019t want to be responsible for her. I want to have a good time with Jenna at a band that is very close to our hearts without having to worry that Miles is gonna have a breakdown. \n\nThe tickets for the concert and train are gonna be expensive so we really want to make it count.\nAlso, Jenna and Miles aren\u2019t friends so I would be ruining Jenna\u2019s night too.\n\nThere have been times that Miles had a breakdown and wanted to leave so Katie had to leave too but she\u2019s her girlfriend, while me and Miles are just friends.\n\n\nSo am I the asshole that I don\u2019t want to bring my friend along?", "created_utc": 1667239442, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yijlfj/aita_for_not_wanting_to_bring_my_autistic_friend/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just tell her you want to experience the concert with your best friend and leave it at that.

But you are fine not to agree to take over a caretaker role for them.", "NAH\n\nYour concerns are valid, but so is Miles' desire to go to this concert. If you're worried about babysitting, have a reasonable conversation with Miles. If you know for certain she's had problems with crowds and noise, ask her if she thinks she can be comfortable, etc. But also, if you just don't want to go with her, don't force yourself to.", "INFO\n\n**ARE** you actually friends with M?\n\n> Because K is my best friend, I am also friends with M.\n\nBut friendship isn't transitive?\n\n> We don\u2019t have a lot in common but we both like the same band.\n\nThat's... that's not much.", "I think its reasonable to just be saying 'Sorry, I wanted to experience this event with just my best friend'. Noting all the other stuff about autism and telling M how their own health issues effect them could come across somewhat condescending though.\n\nDoing this will definitely push space between you and M, but you're not required to be close friends with everybody, or invite all your friends to share every event with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA for the general situation, but watch out how you are treating other peoples health issues as if you know better than them how to deal with it.", "NTA you didn\u2019t ask her to go with you and your not responsible for her well being. This no different from excluding someone else from the trip, it\u2019s about you and your friend enjoying a concert. \nIf she really wants to go she can do it on her own", "NTA at all. It was rude of Miles to invite themselves in the first place. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to want the outing to be just yourself and Jenna, and this is all you have to say. Nobody is entitled to an explanation. The word \u201cno\u201d is a complete sentence. Stand your ground, and don\u2019t let anyone manipulate you.", "NTA but I think you are coming at this wrong. Miles has autism and likes the same band as you. Let's say it's a safe bet the Miles isn't ignorant to what their gigs will be like. So if Miles is still saying they want to go, that's on her to understand her own condition and triggers. \n\nHowever, I'd be tempted to speak to Katy to tell her that you really just wanted this to be you and Jenna hanging out, that you're concerned that Miles hasn't thought this through because of the environment, do they both think you're going to drop everything if Miles does have problems at the gig etc. or will Katy be on hand to help out if needed? Katy needs to understand that she can't force someone on you or force you to get along with someone.\n\nI wouldn't want to omit anyone with a condition or disability from having a fun time, but I would want to make sure there were contingency plans in place, especially if that person is going to a place known for being possible triggers.", "YTA and immature. \n\nAsk autistic friend if they'd like to go.

If they want to go that badly they will go through the annoying process of waiting in the online queue and buying a ticket. If Miles does decide to go, you need to ensure you have your own transportation so you are not stuck ruining your experience if Miles is unhappy. Miles may be totally fine but should operate as their own person from purchase to transportation. You don\u2019t like Miles and you are basically forced together by your best friend which your bf really needs to just stop. Don\u2019t ruin this for yourself, your other friend or your relationship by inviting someone you don\u2019t want to accommodate (which is fine).", "NTA.  You want to go to some effort and expense to attend this concert.  Your friend has a record of being unable to tolerate crowds and loud noise.  A concert is essentially crowds and loud noise.\n\nI agree with the earlier commenter: They can go to the same concert at the same time. But you are fine not to agree to take over a caretaker role for them.", "NTA- autism or not, someone who doesn\u2019t do well in crowds or with loud noises probably won\u2019t do well at a concert.\n\nDepending on how far away the concert is/driving arrangements I\u2019d say \u2018anyone who wants to come is welcome, but if anyone wants to leave early, that\u2019s on them\u2019 \n\nEssentially make it clear that of course she\u2019s welcome, but if any issues come up for anyone, the whole group will not be leaving.", "Yeah I didn\u2019t want to sound ableist when I first wrote it and I was angry at that moment. After reading the comments you may be right and I\u2019m just trying to find a reason why she shouldn\u2019t come when in reality I just want to do it just with my best friend.", "I\u2019m going to be fully honest and say no, K would just be upset if we\u2019re not friends but I can\u2019t say I like M very much. We sit together In a few classes but I always have to explain everything and it just infuriates me.", "Thank you ! I\u2019ll try just tell M that it\u2019s just something I want to do with J.

The fact that OP understands responsibility he will have to face if he bringd M along is enough to make him NTA. \nM is not his girlfriend, nor is she OP'S friend. So it's perfectly fine for him not to take that responsibility. Her girlfriend may take her there and make sure she is comfortable.", "This is ridiculous and in no way OP's responsibility. Autistic friend can arrange all these things for herself, including a ticket.", "I get what you\u2019re saying but sadly the tickets of this specific band get sold out within seconds so there wouldn\u2019t really be much space to just stand quietly and still see the band. It would also ruin her experience if she has to be alone the whole concert because we are more at the front.", "Nope it\u2019s a small venue of around 500 people so it really doesn\u2019t have any more than just a podium and some toilets.", "You are allowed to say no to people. \"No, I want to go with just Jenna for this one. You're welcome to get your own tickets, but me and Jenna are going by ourselves.\"", "wanting to go with just your best friend enough of a reason. If Miles (or her girlfriend) has a problem with this that\u2019s their issue. Go to the concert with Jenna and have a great time!", "Yeah, hard NTA then.\n\nM's disappointment can be K's problem to deal with.", "Well, you have your answer. Because you and M have a mutual friend in K, that doesn't automatically make you friends. Sensory issues or not, you don't have to invite anyone to go along with you if you don't want to.  You are responsible for yourself and so is J.  It's perfectly fine to want to experience this band with only J, as this is something that you have likely bonded over for years.  M is trying to invite herself and you are NTA for telling her that this is something that you and J would like to do together.", "Info- If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what do you mean by explain everything?", "Again, I think that you should let people judge for themselves how their own health problems will affect them, and not try to think you know better than them. They've  lived with it, you haven't.\n\nIf you think there is reason to suspect that they aren't aware what the environment will be physically like as per the crowding, noise, and heat, then you can certainly feel free to point it out to M, but I wouldn't go beyond just noting those facts.\n\nAnd generally, you aren't trying to approach this from a 'This is why you shouldn't go' you are just approaching it as 'This is something I want to do just alone with J'. \n\nDynamic might be a bit different if you were going with a larger group of friends and explicitly excluding M, but just wanting to go with one best friend alone is very reasonable.", "But you don't know, she might be OK with ear defenders.  Autistic folk like to be out and about too they just need to adapt a bit.\nWhat kind of venue? She may need to be in the lobby.  She can still hear them.  ASK her for her opinions and feelings.  Your making wild guesses.\n\nStart the conversation now so next time you'll know for sure.", "Hmm... Even then tiniest clubs had to have something for equality rulings. But then, I don't know all laws in all places", "I have to explain general stuff like why the teacher was asking us something or why we have to do this assignment. But sometimes it\u2019s just things where the sole cause is that she isn\u2019t paying attention, like when she asks why I\u2019m grabbing my book while the teacher just asked us too or what the conversation we were having for half of the class is about. This normally wouldn\u2019t be so bad but if this happens every class I just get irritated that I have to explain my actions. \nIn one of our classes we can have blankets and this has been like that since last year. She wasn\u2019t in class back then so I told her she could take one. When I took one she got angry at me because I didn\u2019t ask the teacher ( you don\u2019t have to ask the teacher) I asked if she wanted me to get her one as well and then she kind of ignored me and was angry even though I explained that you don\u2019t have to ask the teacher.", "Alright thanks. I\u2019ll just say that it\u2019s gonna be pretty crowded and loud and that is it. I don\u2019t want to be ableist or suggest that I know what she needs Better than she does.", "Alright thank you!", "Ok, as someone who is in the process of being diagnosed autistic, I can understand why you need to explain things and why she doesn\u2019t pay attention, basically, autistic people lose concentration very easily and get distracted, this is probably why she asks you to explain things to her and why it seems like she\u2019s paying attention sometimes, however, I\u2019ve dealt with the concentration thing my whole life and while I have asked my friends what\u2019s going on sometimes, if I\u2019m confused, more often than not, I\u2019d ask the teacher, which I don\u2019t understand why M is not doing."]}
