Accountability is important to any job and in life, but particularly for a nanny. I get that she was afraid, but that doesn\u2019t justify lying", "She lost her job because she lied, not because the watch broke.

That\u2019s the detail that pushed it over the edge for me. An accident is fine, but to lie and say a toddler did it? That\u2019s a problem.", "Well, she might have come to regret it but she definitely deserved to be fired for it.", "Being untrusting can be a toxic trait and even if he owns it being toxic I don\u2019t think it\u2019s toxic here. And he commented that the nanny knew about the home being recorded, so I can\u2019t call him wrong in this situation.", "Still! There\u2019s numerous stories out there about long term nannies or babysitters doing the same thing. Plus again she tried to pin the blame on a 2 year old instead of owning up to it the first time! If she would of owned up to it then I would\u2019ve voted E S H for an obvious overreaction. But she didn\u2019t.", "Fair enough but OP seems to buy this version of the story and he saw a video of it", "yeah I don't disagree with that, only with the person above saying the actual watch breaking was deliberate.", "I commented on the recording in relation to him being overbearing in general, not in relation to this incident.\n\nBut firing someone after they messed up, after seven years? That's too extreme imo.\n\nYes she blamed the kid as a cover, maybe scared how he would react to the truth? There's no question of the kids safety being at question here at all. She messed up and lied about it, to a man with issues.\n\nDefinitely ESH in my opinion.", "I'd be inclined to agree but the OP sounds like he has issues with trust generally and she probably knew how he'd react. The nanny clearly messed up but she might have felt if she was honest that he wouldn't react well?", "She made several mistakes. She broke the watch. An accident which could possibly be excused. Then she lied. Red flag. She specifically lied and blamed a child. Another red flag. Then she was given the chance to come clean and lied again. Another red flag. \n\nIf she knows he\u2019s untrusting why would she violate the trust? I can see being scared of his reaction, but tbh her concerns are irrelevant because a responsible adult owns up to what they\u2019ve done wrong. That\u2019s what accountability is and it\u2019s what I would expect from someone who is entrusted with a child. How many times is she allowed to make mistakes and dodge accountability just because he has existing trust issues?", "Yep, and that's the mistake. The lie, blaming the child and then the second lie is all one incident\n\nShe blamed the kid, he asked again and she shrugged. That's just one dumb incident on her part, not three separate breaches of trust. Sounds like it happened over a minute or so in conversation and when called out about it she owned up.\n\nNot great but firing is too extreme imo, especially after seven years. Does seven years count for nothing?", "If it was true and she saw a spider she would\u2019ve come out and said so as an adult who should be trusted, yet she blamed your son. You had every right to lose trust in her, she made it so. NTA I would review pass camera footage to make sure everything was good with your children just in case though.", "NTA.  \n\n\nIt's not like you fired her because you didn't like her shoes. She was negligent with your property and then lied not once but twice to you. Not only that, she blamed a toddler and gaslit you into thinking it was your own fault, and didn't come clean until confronted with indisputable evidence.\n\nSucks, but she made her own bed and now has to lie in it. You did good.", "NTA\n\nJust imagine, this is the one thing she was caught doing, how many things did she get away with in the past and blame your child?", "This isn't the first time she's lied.  This is the first time you've caught her in a lie.\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThe lying is bad.\n\nBut throwing a watch on the floor is next level stupid, and that is not the kind of person you'd want watching over your kids,", "NTA\u2026 ummmmmmmmmmm what?

You can never trust this type of person.", "NTA - she framed a 2 yr old.  That's messed up.", "OP, are you asking whether it was the optimal choice to fire her, or whether it was morally right or wrong to fire her?", "NTA. Had she owned her actions and told you what she did you probably would have been pissed but you would have gotten over it but to blame it on an innocent child and lie to your face that\u2019s unforgivable. Once the trust has gone I\u2019m done.", "NTA and it's never an over reaction to leave your kids with someone you don't trust, regardless of why you don't trust them.", "NTA. She broke your property and then lied about it multiple times and worse she blamed your toddler for the damage.

I\u2019ve accidentally injured friends who were trying to playfully surprise me many times \ud83d\ude05 it\u2019s hard to convince someone that you didn\u2019t mean to hurt them when you whipped around and attacked them with a makeshift weapon. lol\n\nthat being said, although I\u2019d be horribly embarrassed in a situation like this\n(can\u2019t imagine accidentally breaking an irreplaceable object) lying about it is inexcusable. especially from someone that you trust with your home and your children.", "Are you the nanny? Why are you defending her terrible choices so hard? SHE threw the 7 years out by violating the family\u2019s trust at several turns. That\u2019s not on OP. Actions have consequences. Being fired is her consequence. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing for her to lie about breaking the watch. Specifically saying OP\u2019s 2 year old did it is another issue. The issues are related, but it\u2019s more than one mistake. She made several choices and they were all bad ones. \n\nI hate making hypothetical comparisons because of the risk of false equivalencies, but if a partner cheated in a 7 year relationship, lied about cheating, was confronted about cheating and said a break up was \u201cextreme\u201d and asked if the \u201c7 years meant nothing\u201d the internet would read that person to filth.", "I'm not \"defending her terrible choices hard\". She messed up. The response was too extreme. If this is the first time she's messed up in seven years.\n\nThis apparently damning second lie is just him going \"really?\" and her shrugging.\n\nPeople mess up. After seven years she deserves at least some kind of second chance, no?\n\nAnd yes, that analogy is really not a good one."]}
