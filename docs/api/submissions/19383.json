She's a nice lady and was a great nanny. Kids love her, we love her and yeah so we've kept her around even though my wife became a stay at home after our youngest's birth. \n\nEarlier this week I got home and Lila told me that she found my son (2) was playing with my watch and while trying to take it from him he threw it across the room and it broke. I wasn't too happy about that since it was a sentimental, and quite expensive gift, from a late father figure but I clearly remember myself leaving it on the coffee table while working in the living room so it was really my own fault and just charged it. Regardless I don't know why but I went through the footage from our living room camera and it showed Lila throwing the watch on the floor. This was very peculiar so I asked her again about the watch and how my son could've thrown it so hard and she just shrugged. My wife later confronted her with the footage and she confessed that she found my watch and wanted to put it somewhere safe but then she saw a spider on the floor, freaked out, and threw the watch in shock at the spider.\n\nSo I'm a very untrusting guy in general and trust is hard to come by with me. It's a toxic trait of mine but I can't help it. I think we interviewed Lila like 10 times including supervised trials before giving her the job. I'm sad about the watch but I've lost trust her in since she looked me in the eye twice and lied both times. It might be an overreaction but I fired her.

Then she lied. Red flag. She specifically lied and blamed a child. Another red flag. Then she was given the chance to come clean and lied again. Another red flag. \n\nIf she knows he\u2019s untrusting why would she violate the trust? I can see being scared of his reaction, but tbh her concerns are irrelevant because a responsible adult owns up to what they\u2019ve done wrong. That\u2019s what accountability is and it\u2019s what I would expect from someone who is entrusted with a child. How many times is she allowed to make mistakes and dodge accountability just because he has existing trust issues?", "Yep, and that's the mistake. The lie, blaming the child and then the second lie is all one incident\n\nShe blamed the kid, he asked again and she shrugged. That's just one dumb incident on her part, not three separate breaches of trust.

Does seven years count for nothing?", "If it was true and she saw a spider she would\u2019ve come out and said so as an adult who should be trusted, yet she blamed your son.

It should be obvious if that's what happened.", "Its definitely possible, I think most of us have had odd reactions at times when something like an insect has startled us. But also, if that story wasn't true, then what exactly was she doing?\n\nDid she just grab her employers expensive watch and fire it at the ground? That's such odd behaviour. I also can't see how anyone would be surprised at being fired, if that's what they did.", "Why was she touching the watch in the first place?!", "Oh completely unacceptable!

That kind of response doesn\u2019t automatically follow in other panic-fostering situations. My SIL will react very, very strongly to spiders, for example.
