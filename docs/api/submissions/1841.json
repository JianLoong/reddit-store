Maybe the rest of the family should take them in so your grandmother doesn\u2019t have to put up with their selfish entitled attitudes.", "NTA. I feel so bad for grandma. The \"rest of the family\" can just shut the f\\*ck up because they are all talk and no action. If they loved grandma that much they would have done something as a \"family\" to get rid of Mist & Tate from grandma's place. But they wanted you to suffer so they can live their lives. Glad you are living your life!!", "Feel bad for grandma but NTA and don\u2019t think that grandma thinks of you that way either.\nYou are financially responsible for yourself and even taking care of grandma, so NTA\nYour aunt and her son have to figure out what they will do with their lives they are both adults", "NTA - Misty and Tate should be helping grandma with whatever she needs now. You may have physically moved out, but in no way have you abandoned your grandma, who sounds like she gets it and does not blame or resent you at all. Here's hoping she takes you up on your offer to help with an eviction!", "Also probably the rest is only complaining because that means that they have to be involved also in taking care of grandma now\n\nNTA", "NTA. Poor grandma though. Hopefully this is the wake up call they need to be responsible for themselves but it's not likely. And you offered to help your grandma if she needs to evict them so you are definitely NTA.", "NTA although you could have taken a better approach to the issue for your grandmother's sake. Your family is obviously misdirecting their anger at you instead of the actual problem people. They can very well help grandma themselves if they are so concerned for her.", "NTA the rest of your family that call you an AH can then step in and help your grandmother and get those useless freeloaders out!", "NTA and good for you!! Grandma is clearly choosing this situation so tell anyone calling you an AH that they are welcome to move in with grandma or send her money.", "NTA, you agreed to help your grandma and not the other two, who seem to feel entitled to your things and money.", "NTA . Glad you\u2019re free of that terrible situation. Please keep checking in with grandma to see if she needs help with her freeloading houseguests.", "NTA. Is there a chance your grandma can sell her place and move into a senior living facility? That was she can get rid of the leeches and still have community.", "NTA if you had an honest conversation with your grandmother about the toxic living environment and told her if they don't leave you'll have to leave to preserve your own mental health and safety.\n\nIf you just up and left, didn't have the conversation with your grandmother, and you're her primary caretaker, YTA. There are other interventions that could be done.", "NTA", "Why is it the good guy always gets crapped on in these situations.  Someone needs to step in and get Granny some peace and quiet.", "NTA.  You made the best out of a crappy situation.  Your aunt and cousin moved in, treated you and the home badly and you moved out.

It amaze me how people always protect the leeches and treats the others like crap. Kudos for moving out, also, offering legal aid to your grandma speaks highly of you", "NTA. But poor Grandma. So who's calling you an AH? Tell them to step in and help. \n\nMisty and Tate sound horrible. Has Grandma told them they have to leave?", "NTA, but if you're leaving your grandmother entirely alone to deal with Misty and Tate you're straying towards the borderline. Not saying you need to move back in with the horrors, but I'd be looking into ways to help get your grandma out of there as well.", "NTA! I wonder if you can have them evicted for Elder Abuse? Your grandmothers needs her peace and quiet!", "NTA. She\u2019s not living by herself. She\u2019s living with children that need to grow up. The situation sucks but you did the right thing. Have to take care of yourself before you take care of others.", "NTA Sucks for grandma but as the property owner it was her responsibility to keep Misty and Tate under control or evict them if she wanted you to stay, but at least she seems to have come around now.", "NTA and please help gma if you can", "NTA. It sucks for grandma but she shouldn\u2019t have let the loser squad move in.", "NTA, tell the rest of your family you would have kept helping your grandma if Misty and Tate were not there, but they moved in, caused you grief, and if needed, you will help your grandma pay for an eviction lawyer.  What you won't do is work hard to be abused by freeloaders.", "Exactly! They can offer up their homes for Misty & Tate so grandma can have some peace.\n\nNTA", "THIS RIGHT HERE. Since apparently you're abandoning grandma and financially manipulating everyone, tell your family that you'd be happy to return to grandma's house and they can take in Misty and Tate. And who cares what they think? Your grandma is supporting you and she's right Misty and Tate do need to get a job. And grandma should think seriously about accepting your offer to kick them out. NTA", "YUP. Grandma is fine with the situation so the rest of the family has absolutely no say unless they want to take in Misty and Tate. And clearly they don't care much about grandma either.  Its OP who's continuing to look after her wellbeing by offering to evict those two deadbeats if she wants to take that step. NTA", "NTA.  Keep in contact with your grandmother and be prepared to rescue her.  Keep pushing on the eviction thing.", "NTA Tell everyone that you want nothing more than to help Gma but that working 60 hours a week to support the 2 sponges is not going to happen. That you would be more than willing to move back in when the 2 sponges start contributing dollars and chores or they move out. Unless they want to cover the extra costs then they have no say on your decision to leave.", "Call adult protection services and get a case opened for grandma.  Get the authorities notified, and everything documented.  Things could go south really quickly.  Be prepared.\n\nSomeone besides Aunt Misty needs to have a POA too, because these people likely think that they can stay there and cash out if she passes away or needs to go to a nursing home.  \n\nIf grandma has no will, now is the time for taking her to an attorney and having her make one.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it's well past time for you to enjoy your own space. And since the freeloaders have free reign its time for them to work and help out grandma!", "NTA. You're doing the right thing. Your grandma has a soft heart, which usually is a wonderful thing! But your loser aunt and cousin are taking total advantage of her kindness. Keep doing what you are doing. Help grandma anyway you can. But only grandma. The other 2 are adults who need to work for a living! Your family that's complaining, can either take care of them or keep their mouths shut! You are a wonderful grandkid! Keep standing your ground!!", "You're awesome!", "Nta.  They should be mad at the 2 moochers.  Turn them in for elders abuse.", "NTA. You even are protecting your grandmother who enabled Tate & Co. smart of you all around.", "NTA but keep an eye on your grandmother. What your aunt and cousin are doing borders on elder abuse; they might try to access her money or guilt her into giving them some so make sure that they don't drain her funds.", "YTA. You\u2019re punishing grandma for your other relative\u2019s issues. Paying utilities is not paying her rent, so she gets more of a say in her house and food. You\u2019re not obligated to live there but you should have given reasonable notice as a courtesy."]}
