She goes to an after school program which is where she met, Leah (also 10). I know Leah\u2019s mom, Daniella, somewhat well as we had older kids in class together a few years back. \n\nMelody has told me several times that Leah is too loud, doesn\u2019t understand personal space, asks rude questions, etc. I\u2019ve told her they don\u2019t have to be friends, but to still be polite. Daniella later confided in me that Leah is on the spectrum, which I already suspected.\n\nRecently, the kids had a day off. Daniella called and asked if Melody wanted to go to the aquarium with her and Leah. I said sure. When I hung up and told Melody, she got upset and said she didn\u2019t want to go. I said I already told Daniella she\u2019d go and it\u2019d be fun. I pointed out that Leah doesn\u2019t have a ton of friends and maybe if more people took the time to know her, they\u2019d realize she\u2019s nice. Melody grumbled but finally agreed. \n\nAbout a half hour after they left, I get a call from my SIL. Turns out she had taken her son to the aquarium and was leaving as Melody, Leah and Daniella walked in. Melody instantly said she wanted to leave with her aunt. My SIL didn\u2019t want to just take her. I was super embarrassed, feeling bad for Leah. I asked to speak to Melody, telling SIL to take her aside and out of earshot. I told Melody she was being extremely rude. I asked her how poor Leah felt after she went with her and instantly wanted to leave. Melody kept saying she didn\u2019t want to be there and started whining. I finally told SIL to bring her home. As rude as I found this, I realized it\u2019d be even worse for Daniella and Leah to deal with my grumpy, whiny child.\n\nSIL dropped Melody off. I told my daughter she was very rude and it wouldn\u2019t have killed her to spend one afternoon doing something nice for someone. Melody said she doesn\u2019t want to be Leah\u2019s friend and went to her room. I called Daniella to apologize. She was gracious, but did admit Leah cried and they ended up leaving early because she wasn\u2019t having fun. She assured me that she hadn\u2019t paid yet for my daughter before this incident so at least no money was wasted. I did venmo her money for their passes as I felt bad they were unable to enjoy it due to Melody. \n\nWhen my husband found out, te flipped out on me. Telling me I violated our child\u2019s autonomy and that it\u2019s my fault all this happened. I felt this was an extreme overreaction. Especially when he basically coddled Melody and took her to dinner just them. \n\nI feel a valuable lesson was missed yesterday.

Learning to respect people with disabilities does not mean being forced to be friends with them. The legal requirement to accommodate them doesn\u2019t go that far either. You taught your daughter the wrong lesson that she\u2019s not entitled to determine who she forms a relationship with.\n\nAlso consider: disabled people ARE people just like you and I! Not some alien zoo animal. That also means some by nature are assholes even starting as a kid. Having a disability on top doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the cause of someone being an asshole or exonerate them. There are people with autism who are the most polite people in the world and others who truthfully tell you they understood what was right and wrong in a situation but just chose to do wrong. There are people who use a wheelchair. There are people who are depressed. There are also assholes who use a wheelchair, are depressed or with autism.

Leah's mom asked if your daughter wanted to go with them. **Your daughter *didn't* want to.** You made her go anyway.\n\nYour husband is right. You absolutely bulldozed over your daughter's autonomy, and this whole scene *is* your fault. You didn't ask your daughter if she wanted to go.

If they don't need to be friends, they don't need to hangout outside of this activity. And you never should have agreed without even asking her. And when she told you no, you should have respected it. \n\nChildren are humans to. She has her own thoughts and feelings. She deserves a say in her life and who she spends her time with. \n\nWhy would you push your daughter to do this? Why would you do that to your daughter? Why would you do that to the other girl?

Don't push it.", "YTA, you just made your daughter go knowing she has no desire to be friends with Leah.

Do not force your daughter to go to things if she is uncomfortable.", "YTA for being more concerned with Leah\u2019s feelings than your daughter\u2019s. Being nice to someone that you don\u2019t want to be friends with and being forced to go on field trips with them are two different things. And you didn\u2019t even say you\u2019d tag along yourself, you just forced your daughter to go with a kid she has told you she doesn\u2019t like and *her* mom.", "YTA You can't force your daughter to be friends with anyone.  You're teaching her that it is OK to ignore feeling uncomfortable just to avoid being rude... that can backfire!!\n\nNot that this changes anything, but have you tried explaining why this other girl acts differently or has a hard time making friends?  It shouldn't be a means of forcing her to be friends with the girl, but a good lesson in empathy.", "Yta don't volunteer your kids to do stuff.  ESPECIALLY with someone you darn well know she doesn't like!", "INFO: \n\nI'm curious, OP. How often do you, as an adult, volunteer to hang out socially with people who make you uncomfortable because they are excessively loud, fail to understand and subsequently invade your personal space and ask you rude, intrusive questions?", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m glad your efforts to sabotage your daughter\u2019s ability to develop healthy boundaries and balanced approaches to people she dislikes aren\u2019t succeeding.", "YTA.

However I think your husband I also an AH for rewarding her bad behavior.", "YTA.  I would say yes, a valuable lesson was missed yesterday.  By you.", "YTA. Your husband is absolutely correct. You didn\u2019t ask Melody if this was something she wanted to do. You forced her to do something she had zero interest in doing and basically demanded that she enjoy herself and you still don\u2019t think you were the AH? Also, your \u201cgrumpy, whiny child\u201d was only behaving that way because of the miserable situation YOU put her in. A valuable lesson was indeed missed; you obviously didn\u2019t learn to let your child decide who she wants to spend time with for herself. I really can\u2019t say it enough, YTA.", "I think as long as your daughter isn\u2019t being purposefully exclusionary or bullying Leah, it\u2019s okay for her to choose who she\u2019s friends with or not.\n\nI understand where your heart was at. I was the Leah before. Except instead of too loud, I was too quiet, not expressive enough, too anxious to know what I was supposed to do other than play checkers. And that was with my *cousin,* who was supposed to spend the night with me and who I was close with when we were younger. Instead she ran to her mom and begged her to go home, because she \u201chated me.\u201d\n\nAs a former \u201cweird kid\u201d that no peer would be happy to befriend, my heart breaks for Leah. She only wants a friend. But that friend doesn\u2019t need to be your daughter, and shouldn\u2019t be if she doesn\u2019t want to. You shouldn\u2019t have said yes without asking your daughter and when she said no, you should\u2019ve called back and explained your own faux pas. Instead you disrespected your child and made her feel unheard, while building up Leah\u2019s hopes just for them to be broken down.\n\nDid your daughter handle this in the best or most mature way? No, of course not. But she\u2019s *ten.* And she never would\u2019ve been in that position if you didn\u2019t put her there first.\n\nYTA for how you handled this. There are ways to teach empathy and inclusivity without forcing your own will onto her. That will only breed resentment.", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to teach your child to be polite to people even if she doesn\u2019t necessarily like them, but it\u2019s even more important to teach her to have boundaries. Do you want her to grow up and be a people-pleaser who feels rude or guilty saying no?", "YTA. So your daughter has expressed repeatedly that she doesn\u2019t want to be around a girl whose behavior makes her uncomfortable. Instead of being understanding towards your own daughter you force your daughter to endure being around her because you think that being forced to be around her will make other kids like her?? **Being forced to be around someone you don\u2019t like never leads to friendship.**\n\nGood on your daughter for doing what she has to to enforce her boundaries!\n\nI\u2019m glad your husband backed up your daughter. At least she has one decent parent who understands she deserves some autonomy. He did the right thing. You could learn some lessons from him.", "YTA learn to respect your kids no.", "YTA. Not only did you not listen to your daughter, your raised Leah's expectations by making her think she had a friend. And you knew she was on the spectrum.\n\nMaybe stop projecting your childhood and let your child  choose her own friends.", "YTA for making plans for your daughter. Your husband is right.", "YTA. My mother used to do this to me as a child. This reminded me of how awful it felt to have zero choice but hang out with someone who was absolutely frustrating to be around. Because I had to look like I was being kind. It's not kind to fake having fun with someone you don't like.", "YTA- you did not ask your kid if she wanted to go spend a day with someone she doesnt like. She does know Leah, she goes to the same after school program so they have had a chance to see if they like each other.  Parents forcing kids to play never works out, always makes the poor kid feel bad and one look mean. Stop it!", "YTA.\n\n> I violated our child's autonomy and it's my fault all this happened\n\nWhy do you think forcing friendships on your child is okay? She has her own reasons for not wanting to be friends with Leah. Butt out. Your daughter has the right to make her own friends.", "YTA.\n\nIt's wrong to try and force a kid to be friends with someone they don't want to be friends with.  Your husband was really completely correct here, and Melody *deserved* to be coddled to help make up for the mistreatment.\n\nIt's also *counterproductive*.  The kid is absolutely going to resent every minute of it, and there's a strong chance that the \"friend\" will pick up on that, and will end up feeling *worse*.\n\nDo not do this.  You are in the wrong.", "YTA- Your daughter is her own person not someone to pawn off for charity. She didn't want to go, so you shouldn't have forced her.", "YTA. You basically forced your daughter to be somebody else's emotional support animal. It is not your child's responsibility. As long as your daughter isn't openly mean to her and is polite then that's all you should be asking. You cannot force her to be friends with this person or force her to have a relationship with anyone.", "YTA. As you can tell, forcing your kids to be friends with someone just builds resentment, and the person she's forced to be friends with can tell. Leah *knows* your daughter doesn't like her and she's basically a pity friend, and not even by your daughters own choice. She's autistic, not stupid. *You* put Leah *and* your daughter in a bad position when you forced those interactions.", "YTA. Forcing your young child into a situation they have repeatedly stated they did not wanna be in is not okay. Her dad is right you did violate her autonomy. Your child said NO and tried to enforce a boundary you trampled on. Being kind to people on the spectum (and just people in general) is a valuable thing that everyone should teach their kids but not through brute force like you did. All you gained by this was your daughter probably disliking Leah even more. I hope you learn from this, quit being a sucky mom.", "YTA.

You made the bed now you lie in it", "Leah will learn to navigate friendships and modify her behavior as needed through trial and error. It is really important that you teach Melody that no means no and she has a right to consent, and to bodily autonomy and autonomy in general. Your daughter should feel as if she has a bubble of personal space around her and no one can enter it without her say so. You don\u2019t get to loan her out and tell her to have a good time. Maybe Leah really upsets Melody. Melody\u2019s feelings are also important. YTA. Teach Melody to be kind and civil, but no is a complete sentence.", "YTA\n\nYou cannot force friendship.

I'm going to muddy your carpet and eat your cookies and hug you real long, because who cares about boundaries?

You should have discussed this with your kid before agreeing to send her out with people who are not her friends.", "YTA. Well intentioned but not respectful of your daughter's choice. It sounds like she has good reasons for disliking time spent with Leah. You also have good reasons for wanting to teach her to be compassionate and kind to people who struggle, socially or otherwise. But teaching her that does NOT need to involve forcing her to do things she doesn't want to do. The fact that you said yes on her behalf without even talking to her speaks to your lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nKnowing she doesn't like spending time with Leah, you could support and teach her in other ways, such as by being kind and considerate when in Leah's presence at aftercare, letting them hang out while gaming online (ie addressing the personal space issue), or otherwise *working with Melody* on setting up social situations in which she is comfortable socializing with Leah.\n\nI kind of hope a valuable lesson was learned *by you* from this... there are better ways to help someone be a positive member of society. Don't teach your daughter that her needs, preferences, and voice don't matter.", "I agree with you that she needs to be polite with people but doesn't need to spent time with anyone she doesn't want to.

Are you that thick skulled?", "YTA It is fine for you to expect your daughter to be kind to others. It is not fine to force unwanted friendships on your child. You caused this to happen. It is your fault that Leah and her mom were upset. If you want to do a favor for someone, then you do it. Don't make other people including your children do the favors for you, so that you can feel good about yourself.", "YTA. Why would you ever force your kid to go somewhere with people she doesn't like? Isn't that how a bad horror film gets started? She doesn't have a lot of friends. Okay.

My mom made me hang out with a kid who didn\u2019t have friends, too. I got hit, chased and had things thrown at me for no reason. Yes, the kid was on the spectrum, no it wasn\u2019t my problem. As an adult, I definitely feel bad for kids like that, but torturing your own child to be nice to others isn\u2019t cool.", "YTA. You pretend it's \"just being polite\" but your actual demand is that they have a social relationship. You don't spend the day with someone \"just to be polite\". \n\nForcing Melody to fake being friends with Leah is controlling and oppressive to Melody and demeaning to Leah.

She wanted me to bend over backwards for everybody because I didn\u2019t know what they could potentially do for me in the future.

She constantly set up play dates with aholes because she was friends with their parents or because she felt so sorry that no other kids wanted to play with little Daysha.

Her needs and desires are less important than the needs and desires of others.\n2. You are not a safe space for her feelings.\n3. You will prioritize other children over her.\n\nIf you continue to reinforce these lessons your relationship with your daughter will deteriorate until there is nothing else or she'll end up a total doormat who lives to only please mommy and every other relationship in her life with suffer for it.\n\nI strongly suggest  you  do some soul searching to figure out what part of you this behavior is coming from. You probably have difficultly setting boundaries yourself.\n\nIf you want your daughter to be accepting of the neurodivergent people in her life then educate her on neurodivergence, boundary setting and communication.

If you want her to spend time with a person she doesn\u2019t like to assuage your own sense of guilt or pity towards the other child then you need to be present with her to model the behaviour you\u2019d like to see towards the other child.\n\nBut you\u2019ve also been an asshole towards Leah. Growing up on the spectrum isn\u2019t easy but actions like yours make it so much worse for the neurodivergent child because when people spend time with them for reasons other than liking their company it\u2019s harder for autistic kids to understand that not everyone is being fake with them. To many autistic people, being \u201cpolite\u201d amounts to being insincere and unpredictable because politeness means suppressing more direct and honest communication about how you feel and behaving in ways that don\u2019t reflect your true feelings, which autistic people usually perceive as dishonesty.\n\nIt\u2019s much better to tell your daughter to try and overlook Leah\u2019s manner when they\u2019re together and see the good in her, and to keep an open mind about her underlying nature, but without forcing them to interact if your daughter doesn\u2019t develop any genuine liking for Leah.", "YTA forcing your daughter to spend time with someone she didn't want to was out of line.

She goes to an after school program which is where she met, Leah (also 10). I know Leah\u2019s mom, Daniella, somewhat well as we had older kids in class together a few years back. \n\nMelody has told me several times that Leah is too loud, doesn\u2019t understand personal space, asks rude questions, etc. I\u2019ve told her they don\u2019t have to be friends, but to still be polite. Daniella later confided in me that Leah is on the spectrum, which I already suspected.\n\nRecently, the kids had a day off. Daniella called and asked if Melody wanted to go to the aquarium with her and Leah. I said sure. When I hung up and told Melody, she got upset and said she didn\u2019t want to go. I said I already told Daniella she\u2019d go and it\u2019d be fun. I pointed out that Leah doesn\u2019t have a ton of friends and maybe if more people took the time to know her, they\u2019d realize she\u2019s nice. Melody grumbled but finally agreed. \n\nAbout a half hour after they left, I get a call from my SIL. Turns out she had taken her son to the aquarium and was leaving as Melody, Leah and Daniella walked in. Melody instantly said she wanted to leave with her aunt. My SIL didn\u2019t want to just take her. I was super embarrassed, feeling bad for Leah. I asked to speak to Melody, telling SIL to take her aside and out of earshot. I told Melody she was being extremely rude. I asked her how poor Leah felt after she went with her and instantly wanted to leave. Melody kept saying she didn\u2019t want to be there and started whining. I finally told SIL to bring her home. As rude as I found this, I realized it\u2019d be even worse for Daniella and Leah to deal with my grumpy, whiny child.\n\nSIL dropped Melody off. I told my daughter she was very rude and it wouldn\u2019t have killed her to spend one afternoon doing something nice for someone. Melody said she doesn\u2019t want to be Leah\u2019s friend and went to her room. I called Daniella to apologize. She was gracious, but did admit Leah cried and they ended up leaving early because she wasn\u2019t having fun. She assured me that she hadn\u2019t paid yet for my daughter before this incident so at least no money was wasted. I did venmo her money for their passes as I felt bad they were unable to enjoy it due to Melody. \n\nWhen my husband found out, te flipped out on me. Telling me I violated our child\u2019s autonomy and that it\u2019s my fault all this happened. I felt this was an extreme overreaction. Especially when he basically coddled Melody and took her to dinner just them. \n\nI feel a valuable lesson was missed yesterday. AITA?11\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I always saw their problems as mine and any negative emotions from them were my fault. I'm nearly 30 now and very messed up. I am only now learning to set boundaries to keep myself safe.

My mom didn\u2019t believe me when I told her about how the girl was mean because the girl seemed really nice (obviously she\u2019s not going to be mean to me in front of you) and would encourage us to be friends and invite the girl round.

She already expressed she was uncomfortable and didn't enjoy being around this child. Too often we encourage girls, especially, to go out of their way for others and create people pleasers that have difficulty saying no or establishing and holding healthy boundaries. It's sad that the young lady may find it difficult to be different and make friends, especially at this age, but that's on her and her mom to work on. Your daughter is not obligated to help in any way and shouldn't have had to spend a day being miserable because you thought it was a good idea.  If you really wanted her to go, you should have gone with them and taken the opportunity to model the kindness and empathy you want your daughter to learn", "Yta. You forced your daughter to go somewhere with someone she didn't want to be with, you obviously don't respect her. The only lesson she learned from this is you are the kind of parent who doesn't listen or are someone she could trust when you so obviously ignore her wishes like that.", "Your daughter is a human being. She\u2019s allowed to not like people who make her uncomfortable and to want space from them. I guarantee from the phrasing she used (doesn\u2019t understand personal space, asks rude questions) that your daughter feels uncomfortable whenever she is around Leah, and possibly even unsafe. You literally forced her into a situation where she was uncomfortable and are now punishing her for not pushing through her feelings for the sake of someone else. You\u2019re teaching her to be a doormat and put the feelings of others above her own safety. It\u2019s a dangerous lesson to teach a girl. Trust me, I\u2019d know. I have been SA\u2019d multiple times because I didn\u2019t know how to say no, listen to my own feelings, and set clear boundaries. My mother did similar things with me as you are doing with your daughter.\n\nThe other thing that doesn\u2019t sit right with me is that you are treating Leah like a charity case. Leah may have cried because your daughter left, but your daughter left because YOU forced her into a situation where she felt unhappy and uncomfortable. Leaving was the right thing to do. Leah cried because of YOUR choices. Would Leah like to have friends? Yes. But friends are people who like you. She doesn\u2019t need people pretending to like her. She will find her people eventually.\n\nPlease work on respecting your daughter\u2019s boundaries. 10 is old enough that she is capable of making these choices about friendships on her own. The issue is not that your daughter doesn\u2019t want to hang out with another kid, it\u2019s that you\u2019re forcing her to do so. Think about someone in your life who you don\u2019t like. Someone who makes you uncomfortable and unhappy to be around. Now imagine someone forced you to spend time with that person and didn\u2019t even come along to mediate or to see and understand the dynamic that made you feel that way. Have some empathy for your daughter and the situation you put her in.\n\nI know you had good intentions, but the road to h*ll is paved with them. It\u2019s not too late to turn around and head down a path where you\u2019re on a team WITH your daughter, rather than dragging her behind you wherever you think she should go. As I said, my mother frequently did the things you did. And while I haven\u2019t gone NC or LC with her, it\u2019s only because my father is still with her and I couldn\u2019t live without him. I do not trust my mother. I do not give her information that could be used against me. I do not ask her advice or trust her to be on my side. That\u2019s where you\u2019re headed with Daniella.

Melody should have consideration for Leah's autism and be understanding of it. But even with consideration and understanding, they're not going to automatically be friends. Autism aside, their personalities might simply not mesh. The fact that Melody was invited on the playdate shows that she has likely been kind to Leah. \n\nThird, how did you think this was going to play out long term? You say it was \"one afternoon,\" but Melody \"accepting\" the play date is going to make Leah think they're friends. She's going to actively try to hang out with her more. At what point is Melody allowed to break the news that they're not *actually* friends, she was just hanging out with Leah to be nice? How long is she supposed to keep up the charade? Because it was going to come out eventually. This isn't a special episode on a kid's tv show where everyone is nice to the \"different\" kid and learns the value of friendship, only for that kid to never show up again.

And you told her no she couldn\u2019t come home she had to suck it up and stay with the boy at the aquarium because leaving would make him feel bad. Then imagine that you eventually allowed your SIL to bring her home, but chastised your daughter for being rude and not considering the boy\u2019s feelings, making her cry again.

So it Is a good lesson and your motivation was kind, I just think it was too Big of a thing to put that lesson into practice with.  A day at an aquarium isn't a 1/2 lunch period, it's a whole long thing- both girls are old enough to feel the difference between being there w/ an acquaintance vs. w/ a friend.\nWhich leads me to this:  it would be heartbreaking for me to watch my son spend an outing with another kid in this situation b/c he would either mistakenly then think they Are friends, or he would know the whole time and feel like a charity case.  Neither would be good for him.  He is slowly learning the art of making friends and getting the support he needs.  It does take longer with autistic kids but, I think, as their parents, we need to support them through this process as it is more layered than it can be for neuro-typical kids.\nI really feel for Leah, but in this case I think sending your daughter was a wrong move.

And instead of saying, \u201cJust deal with it\u201d she should have taught her daughter how to set clear boundaries with Leah so both her daughter and Leah can have a clear understanding of each other\u2019s needs.

She basically ignored that her daughter was trying to set a boundary and through her actions, told her daughter that her boundaries don't matter if mom wants her to make nice with someone.  \n\nIn fact, OP was so set on ignoring her daughter's boundaries to take advantage of the opportunity to dump her daughter off with someone else for the day (which I only say because I had assumed that OP would be part of a group going to the aquarium as well and was surprised to see not) that she ended up forcing her daughter into a situation her daughter couldn't wait to escape, and ended up hurting another little girl's feelings too (Leah's).

Sometimes they would talk to me instead and in some cases I'd reply and have a small convo, but the blame was still mostly theirs if the teacher caught us (\"I sat you there so that SuperRoby would be a good influence to you, not you a bad one on her! Keep quiet and don't distract her. And SuperRoby, don't respond if they do\").\n\n\n\nThough I must admit, this is just my recollection of the most recent episodes, and my brain probably filtered out a lot of the hurt. There's only one thing I remember being painful, and that was that as soon as the teacher assigning me as \"behaviour buffer\" was out the door, I'd get asked by other classmates to switch seats so that they could be next to their friend and talk during class. I had no problem with it, I didn't care for one place or the other, but it DID make me feel like I didn't have a personality and was just moved around by people who did, because I did not really matter. I did not have friends who would ask others to move in order to sit beside me in class. Whereas sometimes 2 or 3 guys would argue over who would get my seat next to their friend when I switched, so I would sometimes move to multiple places as my classmates rearranged their seats to their liking (like, switch with B so he can sit with A, then switch with D so she can sit with C), and I could always feel when the person next to me was disappointed they didn't get their preferred seat/friend. \n\n\n\nThankfully I made some good friends later on but boy did that have an impact on my self esteem...

As noble as your intentions are, your child needs to be able to have a sense of autonomy.

You could have assisted her in navigating her own feelings around Leah, in enforcing boundaries and rejection with compassion and grace, and perhaps showing empathy for the fact that all people are different and sometimes we don't work together, it happens and it is fine.
