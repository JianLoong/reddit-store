She goes to an after school program which is where she met, Leah (also 10). I know Leah\u2019s mom, Daniella, somewhat well as we had older kids in class together a few years back. \n\nMelody has told me several times that Leah is too loud, doesn\u2019t understand personal space, asks rude questions, etc. I\u2019ve told her they don\u2019t have to be friends, but to still be polite. Daniella later confided in me that Leah is on the spectrum, which I already suspected.\n\nRecently, the kids had a day off. Daniella called and asked if Melody wanted to go to the aquarium with her and Leah. I said sure. When I hung up and told Melody, she got upset and said she didn\u2019t want to go. I said I already told Daniella she\u2019d go and it\u2019d be fun. I pointed out that Leah doesn\u2019t have a ton of friends and maybe if more people took the time to know her, they\u2019d realize she\u2019s nice. Melody grumbled but finally agreed. \n\nAbout a half hour after they left, I get a call from my SIL. Turns out she had taken her son to the aquarium and was leaving as Melody, Leah and Daniella walked in. Melody instantly said she wanted to leave with her aunt. My SIL didn\u2019t want to just take her. I was super embarrassed, feeling bad for Leah. I asked to speak to Melody, telling SIL to take her aside and out of earshot. I told Melody she was being extremely rude. I asked her how poor Leah felt after she went with her and instantly wanted to leave. Melody kept saying she didn\u2019t want to be there and started whining. I finally told SIL to bring her home. As rude as I found this, I realized it\u2019d be even worse for Daniella and Leah to deal with my grumpy, whiny child.\n\nSIL dropped Melody off. I told my daughter she was very rude and it wouldn\u2019t have killed her to spend one afternoon doing something nice for someone. Melody said she doesn\u2019t want to be Leah\u2019s friend and went to her room. I called Daniella to apologize. She was gracious, but did admit Leah cried and they ended up leaving early because she wasn\u2019t having fun. She assured me that she hadn\u2019t paid yet for my daughter before this incident so at least no money was wasted. I did venmo her money for their passes as I felt bad they were unable to enjoy it due to Melody. \n\nWhen my husband found out, te flipped out on me. Telling me I violated our child\u2019s autonomy and that it\u2019s my fault all this happened. I felt this was an extreme overreaction. Especially when he basically coddled Melody and took her to dinner just them. \n\nI feel a valuable lesson was missed yesterday.

Learning to respect people with disabilities does not mean being forced to be friends with them. The legal requirement to accommodate them doesn\u2019t go that far either. You taught your daughter the wrong lesson that she\u2019s not entitled to determine who she forms a relationship with.\n\nAlso consider: disabled people ARE people just like you and I! Not some alien zoo animal. That also means some by nature are assholes even starting as a kid. Having a disability on top doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the cause of someone being an asshole or exonerate them. There are people with autism who are the most polite people in the world and others who truthfully tell you they understood what was right and wrong in a situation but just chose to do wrong.

Leah's mom asked if your daughter wanted to go with them. **Your daughter *didn't* want to.** You made her go anyway.\n\nYour husband is right. You absolutely bulldozed over your daughter's autonomy, and this whole scene *is* your fault. You didn't ask your daughter if she wanted to go.

And when she told you no, you should have respected it. \n\nChildren are humans to. She has her own thoughts and feelings. She deserves a say in her life and who she spends her time with. \n\nWhy would you push your daughter to do this? Why would you do that to your daughter? Why would you do that to the other girl?

Don't push it.", "YTA, you just made your daughter go knowing she has no desire to be friends with Leah.

Do not force your daughter to go to things if she is uncomfortable.", "YTA for being more concerned with Leah\u2019s feelings than your daughter\u2019s. Being nice to someone that you don\u2019t want to be friends with and being forced to go on field trips with them are two different things. And you didn\u2019t even say you\u2019d tag along yourself, you just forced your daughter to go with a kid she has told you she doesn\u2019t like and *her* mom.", "YTA You can't force your daughter to be friends with anyone.  You're teaching her that it is OK to ignore feeling uncomfortable just to avoid being rude... that can backfire!!\n\nNot that this changes anything, but have you tried explaining why this other girl acts differently or has a hard time making friends?  It shouldn't be a means of forcing her to be friends with the girl, but a good lesson in empathy.", "Yta don't volunteer your kids to do stuff.  ESPECIALLY with someone you darn well know she doesn't like!", "INFO: \n\nI'm curious, OP.

However I think your husband I also an AH for rewarding her bad behavior.", "YTA.  I would yes, a valuable lesson was missed yesterday.  By you.", "YTA. Your husband is absolutely correct. You didn\u2019t ask Melody if this was something she wanted to do. You forced her to do something she had zero interest in doing and basically demanded that she enjoy herself and you still don\u2019t think you were the AH? Also, your \u201cgrumpy, whiny child\u201d was only behaving that way because of the miserable situation YOU put her in. A valuable lesson was indeed missed; you obviously didn\u2019t learn to let your child decide who she wants to spend time with for herself. I really can\u2019t say it enough, YTA.", "I think as long as your daughter isn\u2019t being purposefully exclusionary or bullying Leah, it\u2019s okay for her to choose who she\u2019s friends with or not.\n\nI understand where your heart was at. I was the Leah before. Except instead of too loud, I was too quiet, not expressive enough, too anxious to know what I was supposed to do other than play checkers. And that was with my *cousin,* who was supposed to spend the night with me and who I was close with when we were younger. Instead she ran to her mom and begged her to go home, because she \u201chated me.\u201d\n\nAs a former \u201cweird kid\u201d that no peer would be happy to befriend, my heart breaks for Leah. She only wants a friend. But that friend doesn\u2019t need to be your daughter, and shouldn\u2019t be if she doesn\u2019t want to. You shouldn\u2019t have said yes without asking your daughter and when she said no, you should\u2019ve called back and explained your own faux pas. Instead you disrespected your child and made her feel unheard, while building up Leah\u2019s hopes just for them to be broken down.\n\nDid your daughter handle this in the best or most mature way? No, of course not. But she\u2019s *ten.* And she never would\u2019ve been in that position if you didn\u2019t put her there first.\n\nYTA for how you handled this. There are ways to teach empathy and inclusivity without forcing your own will onto her. That will only breed resentment.", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to teach your child to be polite to people even if she doesn\u2019t necessarily like them, but it\u2019s even more important to teach her to have boundaries. Do you want her to grow up and be a people-pleaser who feels rude or guilty saying no?", "YTA. So your daughter has expressed repeatedly that she doesn\u2019t want to be around a girl whose behavior makes her uncomfortable. Instead of being understanding towards your own daughter you force your daughter to endure being around her because you think that being forced to be around her will make other kids like her?? **Being forced to be around someone you don\u2019t like never leads to friendship.**\n\nGood on your daughter for doing what she has to to enforce her boundaries!\n\nI\u2019m glad your husband backed up your daughter. At least she has one decent parent who understands she deserves some autonomy. He did the right thing. You could learn some lessons from him.", "YTA learn to respect your kids no.", "YTA. Not only did you not listen to your daughter, your raised Leah's expectations by making her think she had a friend. And you knew she was on the spectrum.\n\nMaybe stop projecting your childhood and let your child  choose her own friends.", "YTA for making plans for your daughter. Your husband is right.", "YTA. My mother used to do this to me as a child. This reminded me of how awful it felt to have zero choice but hang out with someone who was absolutely frustrating to be around. Because I had to look like I was being kind. It's not kind to fake having fun with someone you don't like.", "YTA- you did not ask your kid if she wanted to go spend a day with someone she doesnt like. She does know Leah, she goes to the same after school program so they have had a chance to see if they like each other.  Parents forcing kids to play never works out, always makes the poor kid feel bad and one look mean. Stop it!", "YTA.\n\n> I violated our child's autonomy and it's my fault all this happened\n\nWhy do you think forcing friendships on your child is okay? She has her own reasons for not wanting to be friends with Leah. Butt out. Your daughter has the right to make her own friends.", "YTA.\n\nIt's wrong to try and force a kid to be friends with someone they don't want to be friends with.  Your husband was really completely correct here, and Melody *deserved* to be coddled to help make up for the mistreatment.\n\nIt's also *counterproductive*.  The kid is absolutely going to resent every minute of it, and there's a strong chance that the \"friend\" will pick up on that, and will end up feeling *worse*.\n\nDo not do this.  You are in the wrong.", "YTA- Your daughter is her own person not someone to pawn off for charity. She didn't want to go, so you shouldn't have forced her.", "YTA. You basically forced your daughter to be somebody else's emotional support animal. It is not your child's responsibility. As long as your daughter isn't openly mean to her and is polite then that's all you should be asking. You cannot force her to be friends with this person or force her to have a relationship with anyone.", "YTA. As you can tell, forcing your kids to be friends with someone just builds resentment, and the person she's forced to be friends with can tell. Leah *knows* your daughter doesn't like her and she's basically a pity friend, and not even by your daughters own choice. She's autistic, not stupid. *You* put Leah *and* your daughter in a bad position when you forced those interactions.", "YTA. Forcing your young child into a situation they have repeatedly stated they did not wanna be in is not okay. Her dad is right you did violate her autonomy. Your child said NO and tried to enforce a boundary you trampled on. Being kind to people on the spectum (and just people in general) is a valuable thing that everyone should teach their kids but not through brute force like you did. All you gained by this was your daughter probably disliking Leah even more. I hope you learn from this, quit being a sucky mom.", "YTA.

You made the bed now you lie in it", "Leah will learn to navigate friendships and modify her behavior as needed through trial and error. It is really important that you teach Melody that no means no and she has a right to consent, and to bodily autonomy and autonomy in general. Your daughter should feel as if she has a bubble of personal space around her and no one can enter it without her say so. You don\u2019t get to loan her out and tell her to have a good time. Maybe Leah really upsets Melody. Melody\u2019s feelings are also important. YTA. Teach Melody to be kind and civil, but no is a complete sentence.", "YTA\n\nYou cannot force friendship.

I'm going to muddy your carpet and eat your cookies and hug you real long, because who cares about boundaries?

You should have discussed this with your kid before agreeing to send her out with people who are not her friends.", "YTA. Well intentioned but not respectful of your daughter's choice. It sounds like she has good reasons for disliking time spent with Leah. You also have good reasons for wanting to teach her to be compassionate and kind to people who struggle, socially or otherwise. But teaching her that does NOT need to involve forcing her to do things she doesn't want to do. The fact that you said yes on her behalf without even talking to her speaks to your lack of respect for her autonomy.\n\nKnowing she doesn't like spending time with Leah, you could support and teach her in other ways, such as by being kind and considerate when in Leah's presence at aftercare, letting them hang out while gaming online (ie addressing the personal space issue), or otherwise *working with Melody* on setting up social situations in which she is comfortable socializing with Leah.\n\nI kind of hope a valuable lesson was learned *by you* from this... there are better ways to help someone be a positive member of society. Don't teach your daughter that her needs, preferences, and voice don't matter.", "I agree with you that she needs to be polite with people but doesn't need to spent time with anyone she doesn't want to.

Are you that thick skulled?", "YTA It is fine for you to expect your daughter to be kind to others. It is not fine to force unwanted friendships on your child. You caused this to happen. It is your fault that Leah and her mom were upset. If you want to do a favor for someone, then you do it. Don't make other people including your children do the favors for you, so that you can feel good about yourself.", "YTA. Why would you ever force your kid to go somewhere with people she doesn't like? Isn't that how a bad horror film gets started? She doesn't have a lot of friends. Okay.

My mom made me hang out with a kid who didn\u2019t have friends, too. I got hit, chased and had things thrown at me for no reason. Yes, the kid was on the spectrum, no it wasn\u2019t my problem. As an adult, I definitely feel bad for kids like that, but torturing your own child to be nice to others isn\u2019t cool.", "YTA. You pretend it's \"just being polite\" but your actual demand is that they have a social relationship. You don't spend the day with someone \"just to be polite\". \n\nForcing Melody to fake being friends with Leah is controlling and oppressive to Melody and demeaning to Leah.

She wanted me to bend over backwards for everybody because I didn\u2019t know what they could potentially do for me in the future.

She constantly set up play dates with aholes because she was friends with their parents or because she felt so sorry that no other kids wanted to play with little Daysha.

Her needs and desires are less important than the needs and desires of others.\n2. You are not a safe space for her feelings.\n3. You will prioritize other children over her.\n\nIf you continue to reinforce these lessons your relationship with your daughter will deteriorate until there is nothing else or she'll end up a total doormat who lives to only please mommy and every other relationship in her life with suffer for it.\n\nI strongly suggest  you  do some soul searching to figure out what part of you this behavior is coming from. You probably have difficultly setting boundaries yourself.\n\nIf you want your daughter to be accepting of the neurodivergent people in her life then educate her on neurodivergence, boundary setting and communication.

If you want her to spend time with a person she doesn\u2019t like to assuage your own sense of guilt or pity towards the other child then you need to be present with her to model the behaviour you\u2019d like to see towards the other child.\n\nBut you\u2019ve also been an asshole towards Leah. Growing up on the spectrum isn\u2019t easy but actions like yours make it so much worse for the neurodivergent child because when people spend time with them for reasons other than liking their company it\u2019s harder for autistic kids to understand that not everyone is being fake with them. To many autistic people, being \u201cpolite\u201d amounts to being insincere and unpredictable because politeness means suppressing more direct and honest communication about how you feel and behaving in ways that don\u2019t reflect your true feelings, which autistic people usually perceive as dishonesty.\n\nIt\u2019s much better to tell your daughter to try and overlook Leah\u2019s manner when they\u2019re together and see the good in her, and to keep an open mind about her underlying nature, but without forcing them to interact if your daughter doesn\u2019t develop any genuine liking for Leah.", "YTA forcing your daughter to spend time with someone she didn't want to was out of line.

She goes to an after school program which is where she met, Leah (also 10). I know Leah\u2019s mom, Daniella, somewhat well as we had older kids in class together a few years back. \n\nMelody has told me several times that Leah is too loud, doesn\u2019t understand personal space, asks rude questions, etc. I\u2019ve told her they don\u2019t have to be friends, but to still be polite. Daniella later confided in me that Leah is on the spectrum, which I already suspected.\n\nRecently, the kids had a day off. Daniella called and asked if Melody wanted to go to the aquarium with her and Leah. I said sure. When I hung up and told Melody, she got upset and said she didn\u2019t want to go. I said I already told Daniella she\u2019d go and it\u2019d be fun. I pointed out that Leah doesn\u2019t have a ton of friends and maybe if more people took the time to know her, they\u2019d realize she\u2019s nice. Melody grumbled but finally agreed. \n\nAbout a half hour after they left, I get a call from my SIL. Turns out she had taken her son to the aquarium and was leaving as Melody, Leah and Daniella walked in. Melody instantly said she wanted to leave with her aunt. My SIL didn\u2019t want to just take her. I was super embarrassed, feeling bad for Leah. I asked to speak to Melody, telling SIL to take her aside and out of earshot. I told Melody she was being extremely rude. I asked her how poor Leah felt after she went with her and instantly wanted to leave. Melody kept saying she didn\u2019t want to be there and started whining. I finally told SIL to bring her home. As rude as I found this, I realized it\u2019d be even worse for Daniella and Leah to deal with my grumpy, whiny child.\n\nSIL dropped Melody off. I told my daughter she was very rude and it wouldn\u2019t have killed her to spend one afternoon doing something nice for someone. Melody said she doesn\u2019t want to be Leah\u2019s friend and went to her room. I called Daniella to apologize. She was gracious, but did admit Leah cried and they ended up leaving early because she wasn\u2019t having fun. She assured me that she hadn\u2019t paid yet for my daughter before this incident so at least no money was wasted. I did venmo her money for their passes as I felt bad they were unable to enjoy it due to Melody. \n\nWhen my husband found out, te flipped out on me. Telling me I violated our child\u2019s autonomy and that it\u2019s my fault all this happened. I felt this was an extreme overreaction. Especially when he basically coddled Melody and took her to dinner just them. \n\nI feel a valuable lesson was missed yesterday. AITA?11\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She shouldn't have to pretend to like Leah and act happy.", "no one wants to be the pity friend though. You might think this is helping but it isn't.  They dont have things in common, thats a very valid reason to not be friends with someone.", "But if they have nothing in common, how do you think friendships will form?", "It's not the kids job to make friends with someone tho. And all it'll do is make her resent the person she's getting forced together with. \n\nAnd as someone on the spectrum I could still tell when a kid didn't like me when I was young. And when we were forced together because of adults like this they were incredibly cruel to me because they were also being forced. \n\nBoth moms are TA here. All it's going to do is cause them to bully each other from my experiences.", "There is a right answer.... don\u2019t force your children to do something that you\u2019re not prepared to do. Adults struggle with social situations with people they don\u2019t enjoy, why do parents think kids should just like everyone? Be polite.... that\u2019s the answer.\n\neta \u2014 I especially don\u2019t like that parents think their little girls should get along with everyone & are not allowed to have their own opinions. \n\nI\u2019m a mom of 4 (2 boys, 2 girls) ... they all have a voice & they are allowed to speak for themselves.", "Don\u2019t have kids if you would have some the same", "There are coworkers I don\u2019t like. I\u2019m polite at work. But I\u2019m not obligated to spend my time outside of work with them. Especially in 1-on-1 situations.\n\nShe needs to be firm but polite during the after school program, but that\u2019s it. She shouldn\u2019t be forced to participate in an activity she wouldn\u2019t enjoy with people she doesn\u2019t like.", "The life lesson is that you have to be polite to people you dislike in situations you can\u2019t control, *which the daughter is already doing.*\n\nThe life lesson is not that you spend your weekend going on outings with coworkers you dislike for longer than you can pretend to tolerate them! That\u2019s dishonest and unkind.", "And as an adult you\u2019re encouraged to set boundaries when people cross lines. Being rude, loud and invading personal space 100% goes into that. \n\nThe child acted mature to voice her issues and the mother ignored it for the sake of what?? Another child that isn\u2019t her own. It\u2019s just virtue signalling at the cost of her own child\u2019s comfort.", "Wrong. The only \u201clife lesson\u201d OP\u2019s daughter learned is her mother cares about being a people pleaser more than about her own kid. \n\nWhile in life you do have to put up with some people you  don\u2019t like you aren\u2019t forced to socialize with them as an adult.", "There are definitely situations where interactions with people you don\u2019t like are gonna be unavoidable, but I think you have it backwards. If it were an event for school or an extracurricular activity, or an important family milestone, that would qualify. A trip to the aquarium that no one asked this girl if she wanted to go on is not one of those situations.", "That's true, but those places you mention are places where you have no option but to be there. Like work or school. It sounds like Melody is kind to the other girl in school. She doesn't have to go to the aquarium if she doesn't want to. She shouldn't be forced to.", "Why do you think kids should be forced to socialize with kids who they don\u2019t get along with? You can teach your kid about compassion without ruining the lesson by making them connect compassion with being stuck around someone they dislike.", "Forcing a child to go somewhere she doesn't want to be friends with is definitely an asshole move.\nEspecially because the daughter already said she didn't want to be friends with the other girl.", "No one wants a pity friend. No one should be forced to be friends with someone they don\u2019t want to be friends with.", "Figuring out other people\u2019s intentions in social situations is hard enough for neurodivergent kids without those people being fake towards them and pretending to enjoy being around them out of pity or politeness. It makes it much harder for ND kids to work out who (if anyone) genuinely likes them or enjoys their company; and many ND people view that kind of \u2018being nice\u2019 as outright dishonesty.", "Damn, if you didn't have pity friends you wouldn't have any I guess.\n\nEdit: looking at your history, you really think parents own their children don't you. Gross.", "There's a thread on r/AmItheButtface written by a high school girl who's being forced to be friends with an autistic kid against her will.

That parson has to get passed the things that about them about us on their own. \n\nBut to later find out this person only hands out with you because their mom made them out of pity? Worst thing ever", "They aren\u2019t a team. This lady is on her friends team, clearly.", "She was the bad guy though", "Especially considering she already said she didn't want to be friends with Leah, and she was never asked before hand if she wanted to go to the aquarium", "That's a good question. In our situation, we've tried to do outings with 2-3 kids, so there's not the pressure on any one kid to be the conversationalist. We've also done one outing to a museum where there was a common interest in the subject matter at that museum.", "I appreciate you sharing your experience.", "I don't see where the mother \\*wasn't\\* prepared to spend time with a person she didn't particularly care for. Frankly, adults do that all the time. \n\nI also didn't see where the OP \"thought her little girl should get along with everyone\". I do think that people in general should be kind to one another.", "I guess but in the real world you're going to cross paths and probably have to spend time with people who you don't like, people who are rude, people with different beliefs, people who smell bad, and all sorts of other weird and unpleasant stuff.  If you turn and go home every time you encounter one, you're never going to be able to leave your house.  \n\nPeople have different feelings on ages and raising kids, but around 10 years old is about the time to stop coddling kids and start showing them the real world with no tantrums and no one to come rescue you when something you don't like happens.  It's a fun time in life, you finally get to spread your wings a little and learn about real life.", "There\u2019s a difference between having to deal with, say, being in line in the grocery store behind someone rude and smelly and having to pretend to be friends with them.", "\u201cSpreading your wings\u201d is about gaining the autonomy to use your own perceptions and judgments to make decisions.\n\nShoving your feelings down and pretending to like a person who violates your boundaries because someone ordered you to to is the opposite of spreading your wings!"]}
