I will provide context tho. So I (28M) have been married to my wife for 4 years and we have a 2 year old son together. My older sister Ariel has 2 kids with her husband. She is my only sibling but we do not speak and haven\u2019t since my wedding 4 years ago. My wife knew I had no relationship with my sister or mother whenever we got together but now it\u2019s causing an argument. \n\nWe were a pretty typical family until my mom cheated my senior year of high school with a coworker. My dad moved out immediately and I moved with him. This caused the riff between me and my sister. My sister believed since my mom was sorry and it was a one time thing (as she claimed which I don\u2019t for a second believe) and was trying to reconcile thru the church that me and my dads refusal to speak with her was somehow wrong. I was 18 and my sister was 20. Long story but eventually my sister stopped speaking with my dad. I haven\u2019t seen my mom since 2016 and we have only spoken once since in 2019 when she tried to invite herself to my wedding. She was not invited but my sister was out of courtesy. My sister didn\u2019t show up and we have not spoken since. My wife knew when she married me that my only family was my dad and my cousins. She said it was okay and she didn\u2019t care.\n\nSo a few months ago my wife got a call from my sisters husband (I\u2019ve never met him) and he said that he wanted to start mending the bridge and would like to have me come meet their kids. I said no. Well then my sister started sending pics of her kids to my wife and my wife sent pictures back. I told her multiple times I did not like this and she told me she could send pics to whoever she wants. I said that if she keeps testing my boundaries she will be a single parent really soon. That she signed up for me as is. My wife is saying it\u2019s wrong to deprive my son of his family. I said I don\u2019t even have a relationship with my sister or BIL so why should my kid? That doesn\u2019t make me feel comfortable at all and I don\u2019t even know these people. Also any pic she sends could easily be forwarded to my mom and she needed to think about that. She said she doesn\u2019t even understand why my mom can\u2019t meet her kid and that comment alone pissed me off because I\u2019ve explained my family drama for years and it feels like she just ignored it. I said she really needs to think about who she wants to appease because I\u2019m not gonna stand for disrespect of my boundaries. My dad totally agrees with me and is telling me I should start setting aside money now for a exit strategy. Because my wife\u2019s behavior is exactly how my mom used to act and I should see the warning signs now.

I hated him and wanting nothing to do with him by my teenage years. He was an alcoholic and was going downhill fast by the time I went to college. I set boundaries on when he could see me. I learned about his own abuse growing up and how that affected him. A few years later, he stopped drinking at 50 and went through a few years of rebuilding his life and career. He was of the mindset that whatever he did in the past should stay in the past, but after several years of him refusing to acknowledge the impact of his behavior, I told him that if he wants to be in my life, he has to accept that there are days I just don't want to talk to or see him. I told him that even though what he did to us had long passed, the effect it had on us was ever present. If he couldn't accept that and allow us our anger and hurt, then we could never truly forgive him. He finally got it. He approached all of us individually to sincerely apologize. The family dynamic shifted for the better after that. While he and I never had the close relationship I had with my mother, we were close and would talk often. He flew out many times to see me. \n\nPeople often ask me why I forgave him or even allowed him back in my life. I always say that I got tired of living with anger. I don't want to live my life being angry because it affected everything about me. The forgiveness was for my own well-being. And I'm glad I did forgive him and allow him to be a parent, especially after my mother died at a young age. We still had our moments (boundaries are always important), but I'm glad we rebuilt our relationship.

You may not always agree with the choices and boundaries your spouse makes but you ABSOLUTELY respect them and if you disagree, you TALK. Not dismiss and go behind their back against their express wishes", "Reading his comments sounds like both parents were horrible with each other and Op already has a foot out the door, he needs therapy urgently if he can easily say he's willing to abandon his children and create a whole new family just to punish his wife, nasty overall.", "Your father may not be looking out for you.

I knew how it would go but said fine, enjoy the shitshow on speaker phone. I got screamed at by her drunk ass for a good five minutes. How DARE I go no contact with her. How DARE I set boundaries with her. I belong to HER. I don't belong to my husband or myself either. I'm hers.

They are there for a reason and you either support my boundaries and my personal bubble and mental health the way I need it to be or you and I aren't together anymore. We shared this situation with our friends as we were driving when it happened and were on our way to meet up with them. They were in shock too and said they couldn't imagine any family, especially a mother, acting like that. But then they teased me a bit and every so often I get random messages out of no where from them saying \"FUCK YOU I DONT CARE!!\" lmao. \n\nI think the dad is right that he needs to be prepared for a divorce if he has hardlined this boundary and is serious with his threat. He also needs to schedule with a marriage counselor to have a trained neutral party help the wife understand how awful she is being.

Why on earth should OP\u2019s kids be robbed of their experience of having an aunt and a grandma, possibly two loving, supportive adults in their lives, over a mistake that was made so many years ago?

But if my husband ever cheated on me, I would never encourage my children to cut off contact with him. Because their relationship with him as a father is separate from my relationship with him as a spouse. I think the dad was wrong from the get-go for not encouraging this son to learn to forgive his mom and maintain a relationship with her. And who knows why she cheated? Maybe the husband was abusive/ignored her/etc. Not that cheating is ever the right answer, but this guy has no idea what went on in his parents' marriage.", "What an immature statement.

If my wife were to cheat on me, I would be gone as well.\n\nNow OP has a wife who knew going into the marriage that he did not want contact with his sister or mother. While we only have a specific view from the story given, he set that boundary for a reason. I went no contact with my mother after decades of physical and emotional abuse. If my wife were to disregard my desire to keep distance from my mother because of that, it would be an issue as well.\n\nThis is solely an issue of OP's wife not respecting known boundaries. This is a declaration of saying that his feelings do not matter by his wife. That is emotional abuse. The father is just trying to be realistic. He went through a relationship that clearly led to betrayal by his wife. If the warning signs are there, it is not wrong for OP's dad to protect his child, as it is apparent OP's mother, sister, and now wife don't seem to care.", "Well no shit his wife cheated on him and his daughter took his cheating ex\u2019s side. Of course he\u2019s bitter.", "I'm not sure about that, but I find it funny that not many are pointing out the sister took the mum's side and even went NC with Dad, because he wasn't interested in reconciling? Yeah I get why OP doesn't have a relationship with the sister", "Nah, my husband and I were both children of divorce as a result of cheating, and the way his mom injected the kids into every layer of the divorce and turned them against him was fucking tragic. \n\nThe man has a scar over his eye from her throwing a butter dish at him when he asked for butter at the dinner table one day after work. The kids witnessed this and would joke about it until I said out loud \"that's kinda fucked\", which made them stop for a second and think. Mom got kids to break into his email and read his sexts to his mistress 5 years later pretending she couldn't figure it out herself because she wanted to make sure he could never have a relationship with his kids.  \n\nA relationship between a husband and wife is just that, a relationship between a husband and wife. Kids should never have been involved, should never have the full story outside of the few facts around why, and should be given the space to judge their parents based off their their relationships with them as mother and father. I don't have a relationship with my dad because on top of a cheater, he's a fucking deadbeat. My husband's dad should have been allowed to have a positive relationship with his kid, given he was there and present driving 8 hours round trip every weekend to hang out with them, took off work every single competition and every single field trip despite living 4 hours away, and paid for all of their bachelors and master's degrees. By all accounts, he might have been a bad husband, but at no point by their own description was he ever a bad dad.", "I was just thinking the exact same thing. The dad isn't giving me any bad vibes at all. I think his advice (to start prepping to leave wife) is definitely biased, but of course it would be. The man got his life and family ripped apart by OP's mom. I think OP should therefore take that advice with a grain of salt, however, wife is not behaving in a way that inspires confidence in their partnership. I'm pretty surprised at all the people taking mom/sister/wife's side, since whenever similar situations are posted with roles reversed everyone is always supporting the party who cut off the cheater.", "Exactly, AITA's double standards are coming out in full force here.

Is OP reacting very aggressively? Yeah but his wife betrayed him after he said no and established clear boundaries.", "The sister sided with the parent who cheated and defended them.

This is his life and child, so his choice.  If his wife can\u2019t understand or appreciate his situation, that\u2019s on her.   His feelings and actions in this situation are appropriate.

Being hurt doesn\u2019t actually come hand in hand with being bitter, bitterness usually only comes when you don\u2019t process or move past the hurt. If you\u2019re still actively holding onto bitterness almost a decade later then for your own sake you should really seek some therapy or counselling. You don\u2019t ever have to forgive the person who hurt you, but holding onto the feelings that strongly this long after the fact is not healthy for your own mental state.", "Oh that was my implication in this comment as well.

If you want to try to save your marriage, I'd suggest you go again with your wife to the same therapist if you can to reiterate to her why your NC with your sister and mother. She has her family and doesn't understand that not only did your mother cheat, but she and your sister tried to manipulate both of you to come back and play happy family and when neither of you did, they full on attacked.

Tell your wife to imagine someone taking a hammer to your son\u2019s fingers - can she imagine a scenario where she would forgive that person and want that person in her life?

I would say E-S-H, except for the spouses are completely in the right for trying to give their children a relationship to their extended family. \n\nYou are too weak to work on your own mommy and daddy issues, so now you\u2019ve decided to pass them on to your innocent child. Good job bud.\n\nEdit: my god your comments. The way you talk about your immediate family is freaky dude.

You and your father sound rigid and judgmental. I abhor cheating, but recognize that people are imperfect and can make mistakes. Your family was basically cut down the middle, apparently because you and your father chose this. How sad that your child will be deprived of family and a grandmother because of mistakes made many years ago. Sometimes cutting off family is appropriate when family members persistently display unhealthy behaviors or do not recognize boundaries. You did not give information supporting that this is the case with your sister and mother. How sad for all of you.", "So, you threaten your wife with child abandonment, and avoid any attempt at rebuilding bridges with someone who did nothing to you or your family, because you are mad that your mom had sex with someone that wasn't your dad 10 years ago?\n\nGrow up, the fact that you think this is even remotely a decent option, and call it a \"boundary\" to justify it (they're not doing anything to you), and threatened to *leave your fucking children* over something you weren't even involved in is extremely unhinged, and so is everyone else suggesting than anyone other than you, OP, is the asshole. \n\nNot only are you the asshole, you seem extremely unwell, and all of you suggesting that OP is NTA are being complicit in what could very well turn out to be parental abandonment or abuse.", "Umm so your wife dis something you didn't like and you immediately threatened to not only leave her but to leave her as a single parent to raise YOUR CHILD alone? AH", "YTA (happy to change it with more information)\n\nI'm seeing the personality trait here of inflexibility and the behavioral traits of blaming others, all or nothing thinking, and extreme behaviors.\n\nYou may get some of these traits from your parents.\n\nDo you feel that you have a choice to have both your parents in your life, would your dad be fine with you having a relationship with your mom, or would your dad cut you out? In your telling, it doesn't appear that your sister chose to cut contact with her dad. He chose to cut contact with his daughter. Your dad engages in splitting.\n\nYour dad cut his daughter and her children out of his life. If your wife wants to have a relationship with your sister and her children, you'll divorce her. These are examples of extreme behavior.\n\nModerate behavior would mean something like going to couple's therapy to talk through the issues with your wife. Moderate behaviors from your dad would look like saying, \"Daughter, I love you. But I'm not in a place where I can talk about your mother. If we talk about other things, I would love to spend more time with you.\" Rinse and repeat as necessary because he loves his daughter, he doesn't see her as merely an extension of his (imagined all evil) ex-wife, but as a child he cherishes as a whole human being.\n\nYou can have your boundary that you don't want to see your sister or your mother. Are you afraid that if your wife comes to know your sister or (heaven forbid) your mother, that she will enjoy their company? Are you afraid your kids will enjoy the company of their cousins?\n\nAre you afraid to let in any information that adds nuance to the history of your mother and father?\n\nWhen your children are adults, if they haven't chosen you over your ex-wife, will you cut them out of your life?\n\nI had an ex threaten to make me a single parent. I had come to realize that he was a controlling person who didn't respect others. Luckily it was an empty threat. He is still in his kids lives. I still divorced him because I felt like in many areas of my life he wanted me to erase myself and advocating for my values ended up in fights that left me utterly drained. He was always insisting that he was right. He couldn't accommodate my values alongside his.\n\nThere is no point in assigning blame to your parents as to which one made you inflexible, black and white thinking, and extreme behaviors.

So your mother wasn\u2019t a perfect person and fell off her pedestal.  It happens.  But you see things in a very black and white way, which is really not healthy.  You took the side of your father, but have you ever thought about the circumstances that may have lead to you mother having an affair?  Was your father emotionally distant with her.  Did he tell her that he appreciated what she did?  Did he criticise her or belittle her?  And how do you know that your father hasn\u2019t cheated on her, but never got caught.  You saw things the way a teenager sees things, and you haven\u2019t matured since then.  To now be saying that you will leave your wife over wanting to meet the other members of your family is childish and vindictive, and your father should not be encouraging you to leave your wife over this.

Good luck in life!", "ESH\n\nYour wife should respect your boundaries. Your mom for cheating. Your sister for ditching your wedding and then acting like she wants a relationship, solely because she wants your child in her life. Both of your parents are the biggest AH's for letting their marriage divide the family and manipulating their children into taking sides.\n\nThe dynamic between you and your dad is insanely unhealthy. Your dad was understandably fuming, but he's letting that anger control his AND your life. Your dad needs to stay out of your marriage and stop planting contempt for your wife in your head - although I'm guessing this isn't the first time you let your dad fill you with rage. Honestly it sounds like he wants to live vicariously through you and fuel some sick revenge fantasy. Your dad wants to wither away in bitterness, and it sounds like he's infected you.\n\nThe fact that you're so willing to leave your wife/child over this is completely batshit crazy. I think you probably love your wife, so my unqualified armchair therapist analysis is that your dad has completely brainwashed you with rage. Anything around the topic of your sister/mother elicits the rage that your father put into your head.
