{"id": 8156, "submission_id": "10k87m1", "title": "AITA for forbidding my sister to meet my child and telling my wife to butt out of the situation?", "selftext": "So the judgement is pretty much exactly as the title suggest. I will provide context tho. So I (28M) have been married to my wife for 4 years and we have a 2 year old son together. My older sister Ariel has 2 kids with her husband. She is my only sibling but we do not speak and haven\u2019t since my wedding 4 years ago. My wife knew I had no relationship with my sister or mother whenever we got together but now it\u2019s causing an argument. \n\nWe were a pretty typical family until my mom cheated my senior year of high school with a coworker. My dad moved out immediately and I moved with him. This caused the riff between me and my sister. My sister believed since my mom was sorry and it was a one time thing (as she claimed which I don\u2019t for a second believe) and was trying to reconcile thru the church that me and my dads refusal to speak with her was somehow wrong. I was 18 and my sister was 20. Long story but eventually my sister stopped speaking with my dad. I haven\u2019t seen my mom since 2016 and we have only spoken once since in 2019 when she tried to invite herself to my wedding. She was not invited but my sister was out of courtesy. My sister didn\u2019t show up and we have not spoken since. My wife knew when she married me that my only family was my dad and my cousins. She said it was okay and she didn\u2019t care.\n\nSo a few months ago my wife got a call from my sisters husband (I\u2019ve never met him) and he said that he wanted to start mending the bridge and would like to have me come meet their kids. I said no. Well then my sister started sending pics of her kids to my wife and my wife sent pictures back. I told her multiple times I did not like this and she told me she could send pics to whoever she wants. I said that if she keeps testing my boundaries she will be a single parent really soon. That she signed up for me as is. My wife is saying it\u2019s wrong to deprive my son of his family. I said I don\u2019t even have a relationship with my sister or BIL so why should my kid? That doesn\u2019t make me feel comfortable at all and I don\u2019t even know these people. Also any pic she sends could easily be forwarded to my mom and she needed to think about that. She said she doesn\u2019t even understand why my mom can\u2019t meet her kid and that comment alone pissed me off because I\u2019ve explained my family drama for years and it feels like she just ignored it. I said she really needs to think about who she wants to appease because I\u2019m not gonna stand for disrespect of my boundaries. My dad totally agrees with me and is telling me I should start setting aside money now for a exit strategy. Because my wife\u2019s behavior is exactly how my mom used to act and I should see the warning signs now.
