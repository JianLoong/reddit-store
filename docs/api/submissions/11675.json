Lol, some people... smh.", "Absolutely agree! How are are you going to stay in someone\u2019s house for free and they tell you you\u2019re using too much water and you\u2019re going to be rude about it and say it\u2019s ridiculous.", "She obeyed his rules and got a hotel. They didn't like being bypassed and losing control over her behahior.", "so going to a hotel so that OP can actually enjoy her vacation was the relationship ender? uh, that seems odd", "I moved to a hotel when he had a problem.", "Did you read the post???", "Why does that matter, they went and got a hotel room so the parents don\u2019t need to worry about it and she can bathe shower as long as she wants. She fully accommodated their wishes.", "She did do it at her own expense which id why she got a hotel room and it was still a problem for them. This isn't about money this is about the dad being a weird controlling prick and her boyfriend being pathetic for not standing up for her. \n\n\nThey own 3 houses I think they can deal with the extra water expense for a week.", "It\u2019s their third house. They can afford it. \n\nThe only way this is not ok is if OP was hogging up a shared bathroom and other people needed to use it. She\u2019s on vacation and should be allowed to act like she\u2019s on vacation. BF\u2019s parents are just power tripping.", "You can\u2019t disrespect rules that no one told you about ahead of time. They disrespected their guest and she was right to leave.", "She did her routine & they had a problem with it. She went to continue her routine in peace--NTA!!", "This is so unhinged. Yikes!", "What the fuck are you talking about ? LMAOOOO \ud83d\udc80", "But she did leave... and they had a problem with that too. NTA", "You aren't terribly logical. I have a dirty job. I come home coated in dust and grime from the day. Dirt on my hands, my face, and in my hair. If I get straight into a bath the water is immediately opaque, and there will be a very distinct ring at the level where the water was. If I take a minute to shower, I can clean most of that off, and have it run down the drain in a minute or two, before filling the tub with hot, clean water to soak my muscles in. I have an efficient shower head, it would take several minutes to fill a five gallon pail. Separating the shower and the bath by twelve hours wouldn't change the total volume of water used. Are you the sort of person who regularly steps over a dollar to chase a penny in other ways too?\n\nBravo to the OP, you handled that beautifully, and you paid attention when they showed you who they were! Lucky they did that now! NTA", ">I was like fts and got myself a hotel room\n\nYeah - at that point YTA \n\n>So I stopped hanging out with my boyfriend and his family for the rest of the week and only saw my now ex on the awkward flight home.\n\nAnd there is the clincher", "Also considering the fact OP is not paying the water bill YTA", "4 bathrooms for each bedroom and a half bath with shower downstairs for beach guests.", "This! I don't know how ugly the argument got, maybe something is left out there, but it looks 100% like they had a problem, she found a solution and they we pissed she didn't just do it their way.\n\nMy house my rules is pretty much if you don't like it leave, so she left. So NTA as long as there isn't anything being left out.", "Not really, she stopped wasting their water as soon as the rude dad brought it up to her. She had every right to leave.", "Yes, absolutely. This is what I was searching for.", "Because they couldn\u2019t control her", "It's more likely to be a septic tank issue than a water supply issue. Replacing an ancient drain field with a modern system can cost a small fortune.", "Okay, so I was confused, I thought you meant every night you shower and bathe. But based off another comment you shower in the morning and bathe at night. That\u2019s normal, especially if you are being physically active durning the day. \n\nFamily seems controlling. They don\u2019t want you to stay and use their water twice a day, but are also upset if you get a hotel so you can do as you please? Nta", "She showers in the morning and takes a bath before bed.", "I have to take a shower before I take a bath. I don\u2019t like the idea of soaking in my own filth so I like to be clean before I get in the tub to soak.", "Ah. Punctuation is your friend. \n\nYTA to expect to take a bath every night at someone else's house.", "Iirc you use water to get wet then turn it off and get all your soaping done. Then rinse off. Then water back off if you have a second phase (conditioner, shaving, etc) then water back on to rinse then done. Saves a ton of hot water and wasted water in general.", "Nope, don\u2019t have a clue about the water situation. That being said, if someone raises a concern in their home/vacation home, they probably are indicating an issue. It sucks when you want to take a shower, but have no hot water, or have a water bill that is double the normal rate due to water usage. YTA based on your avoidance on solving the issue.", "You..ask?", "So isn't it your obligation to check this before hogging all the water? Did you even bother talking with your bf why this was an issue?", "Might wanna check the attitude.\n\nYTA", "It\u2019s also about water conservation. For example, if you\u2019re in a drought stricken area like California, taking a shower and a bath the same day is wasteful. And yes, hot water is expensive.", "You aren't expected to magically know. You could have asked tho. But the fact the you avoided the question when asked by every other commenter, kind of seemed sketchy. If you didn't know that's all you had to say to any of the other people asking \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but you're pretty much still TA because they asked you not to do something on their property and you decided that a couple baths was enough to no longer be in a relationship with someone you had previously liked enough before hand to go on vacation with him and his family", "If the house isn\u2019t connected to mains water than the only water source is rain water collected and stored in tanks.", "Well acting pretty entitled and like an ungrateful guest is pretty telling. They told you it was an issue, and you couldn\u2019t even find a middle ground.", "Well this is exactly why it was rude to just assume the liberty taking a shower and bath every day in someone else's home. In every place's I've ever lived, that amount of hot water consumption would be an inconvenience to other people in the house even if you put aside utility costs and bathroom space. I'm thinking this is the most likely reason he asked you to stop, but it was definitely rude of him to ask without providing any explanation why.", "I don\u2019t throw a tantrum when people tell me I\u2019m using too much and act like because they own multiple properties t\u2019s fine for me to ignore their reasonable requests. \n\nYTA,  check you entitlement. And your water usage. It\u2019s not an unlimited resource.", "Depends on where you live!", "I see. Either way OP would still be taking both in one day and baths are a good way to wind down, though not an ideal way to get clean on their own.", "Why her finding other accomodations that worked for her was treated as a disrespect then?", "if that's the case make sense, but I believe it deserves an explanation beyond \"don't take 2 showers a day\"\nAnd the fact that they get mad at her for going to a hotel and doing things her way and not their way bothers me too.", "I'm Australian and I bathe twice a day? Do other people not do that? I'm not in there for hours but I like to have a shower to wake up and one at night so I don't go to bed dirty.", "Except that she told him his rules were ridiculous. \n\nThere are legitimate reasons for the rule, including things like hogging a shared bathroom or using up a limited supply of water.", "Fair point.\n\nThis whole situation could have been avoided had OP, her (ex) boyfriend, and his parents talked about house rules and considerations BEFORE staying at the vacation house.", "Nah it\u2019s absolutely on the weirdass parents, I just find the escalation so shocking, from the way she told the story. She should never have been put in that weird situation by the crazy dad who\u2019s the bigger AH to begin with, tbf", "[deleted]", "But she was still a rude guest before she opted for the hotel - it's not like that was her plan all along.", "That\u2019s not relevant at all", "Even if, it's not anyone's place but there's to decide if they can or want to afford it.", "doesn\u2019t matter that they can afford it, it\u2019s wasteful.", "I would agree with you, except she argued about the rule after she was told about it. She told him the rule was \u201cridiculous\u201d. That\u2019s the disrespectful bit. I do agree that she was right to leave", "You didn't answer about using up the hot water - this is pretty relevant info...\n\nAlso, did he offer a clear reason for requesting you stop?", "Based on that info it seems a rather trivial issue but at the same time you are a guest.", "Yeah they are absolutely ridiculous I\u2019m glad you got out of that. Little situations always lead to bigger ones in the future especially with in-laws. You even took it upon yourself to get a hotel room to appease the situation because you understood it\u2019s their house. They just wanted to have a problem with you. You literally gave them a solution to their problem. Now if you didn\u2019t listen and disrespected them that\u2019s different. You did nothing wrong.", "The OP isn't an AH for leaving to go to a hotel.\n\nShe is an AH for wasting water this much. She disrespected the dad by claiming the house rules were ridiculous. The BF isn't an AH for reinforcing the house rules.\n\nThe OP could've apologized, but she was too stubborn to do so.", "You're right, I read it wrong, definitely nothing wrong with that, specially if you're out and about during the day.", "Nope you\u2019re wrong. Read again.", "Ok but when she was asked not to do that she found alternative accommodation to be able to keep her routine going. It's not like she kept doing it at their place after they told her not to.", "That is my normal way to shower - how would you do it different???", "She did solve the issue, though. She left.", "She stopped hogging all the water when she left, though. After they told her the water use was an issue, she left and never used another drop. If the issue was water consumption, leaving to go to a hotel should have solved that issue.", "Being a good houseguest means minimizing your impact on someone else's life.   Don't waste things like water and electricity.   Don't order the most expensive things on the menu because your not paying.   Don't eat all the food before anyone else has a serving.  Don't delay people.  Don't be late.  NO ONE besides little kids should be taking a bath at someone's home while visiting.", "I was only offering a reason as to why water might be limited.", "The dad said \"don't take a shower AND a bath\", not \"don't take 2 showers a day\".\n\nOP should have asked if it was okay to take a shower in the morning and a bath in the evening.\n\nThe parents should have laid some house rules for guests to follow.", "> This whole situation could have been avoided had OP, her (ex) boyfriend, and his parents talked about house rules and considerations BEFORE staying at the vacation house.\n\nHowever, you can not make a list of rules in advance that cover every human behavior, \"In our house it is not allowed to eat the family dog\". \nBut you still can expect common sense for your guests \n\nThere can multiple reasons for why not take shower and a bath in the morning:\n- water are restricted/expensive \n- energy prices are expensive \n- Only one bathroom in the house and OP occupied it for long time in  the morning \n\nThe button line is that the owner asked a reasonable request, and OP went ballistic \n\nThat's why YTA", "Well done.", "So is having three houses. I doubt FIL is concerned about the environment.", "His house his rules", "I grew up in a home with 4 bathrooms and you could still pretty quickly drain the hot water so others weren\u2019t getting hot showers. If it\u2019s a cabin, or on an older system, the hot water tank can take a long time to heat back up. I would assume that would be the issue and I would get the family not wanting OP to use the hot water both times especially if there are parents and other siblings in the house needing to bathe.", "Not sure \"got out out of that\" is appropriate here - was just a request to not do something in their home.  Maybe an odd one, but we don't have all the information here.\n\nI think OP might be a teenager, honestly.", "Yeah but she was rude and disrespectful about it. She called his rule ridiculous without even asking why and then got an attitude and left. She acted like a brat.", "Leave the water running the whole time.", "Most people have the water running during their shower", "Lol that's what I thought.. isn't that how people normally shower?", "Let her other half and the house. Sometimes things work out for the best in the end.", "On the face of it, that might seem correct but it's a very aggressive and immature move. Had she had a rational conversation with them and had the parents been in the wrong then it would make sense. But she didn't even try to act like an adult. Just upped and left.", "Thank you very much for covering parts I missed to explain.", "This is true, but further from the point in question.\n\nI'd still say ESH because as a wealthy/wasteful person himself, he really should have let it slide and just been a more gracious host instead of making a power move.\n\nBut - Op was being a rude guest in the first place, and unless the dad really spoke down to her in his tone, she should have just respected this simple request instead of answering with her own power trip.", "Did you use up the hot water when other people still needed to bathe?", "I fully agree with this and with multiple bathrooms, that means multiple people could be bathing at one time, which drains the hot water even faster.", "Most hotels won\u2019t rent rooms to teenagers without an adult.", "No, it definitely isn't", "We have a bathtub/shower combo, and just reaching a wet arm out of the spray to grab the shampoo from the other end of the tub is painful this time of year. In winter if we wet ourselves down and then just stood around exposed to the cold, we'd freeze, more so for the elderly!", "Do hotels actually check ID?  I rented a room when I was a teenager for sure (ages ago), but may have just been where I was living."]}
