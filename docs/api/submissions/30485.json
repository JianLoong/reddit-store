If the membership does not make a difference in your household's lifestyle, there is no reason to drop it. It also kind of feels like your husband is sabotaging it when you're attempting to actually use the membership and I have to wonder why. Would you both be willing to find a cheaper gym ? If you offer this compromise and he also refuses it, then I have to wonder if the problem is not the money but the time spent on your own thing.", "NTA - how expensive is gym membership nowadays? Your husband is either cheap or controlling. If I were you, his annoying comments would motivate me to go to the gym more. In spite \ud83d\ude00", "NTA, he wants you to cancel so you will be forced to stay home and take care of the baby. Don\u2019t do it, u deserve at least once a week to go to the gym and take care of yourself and your body", "It\u2019s funny that he\u2019s calling you selfish when you\u2019re the one struggling with ppa and he\u2019s trying to take away an outlet that often improves physical and mental health.

This isn't about the Iranian yoghurt (or the cost), this is about the gym taking you away from bub and the load being put on hubby.

Your husband is a selfish prick honestly.  NTA, OP.  YOU TELL YOURSELF WHEN TF YOU'VE \"HAD ENOUGH TIME\".  In the meantime does he need a pop up book on how to give basic care to a child?  And I don't mean your 2 year old I mean your 38 year old.", "NTA, like others have said this is about your husband not wanting to take care of the baby while you are out.

He should be supporting you in your decision to return to it, helping where he can to help you be the you you want to be.", "NTA keeping the gym membership is motivation- it will keep you striving even if it is once a week for now and as she gets older you'll get back to it. Are you sure the issue isn't more your husband having to watch your daughter while you're out? It sounds more like he can't be bothered and is trying to guilt you to get out of watching his own kid once a week. I would not have anymore kids with him til he can grow up.", "No, but you are married to one.", "NTA and next time don\u2019t take his calls while you\u2019re there.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to try and do something for yourself that makes you feel better. He can suck it up and try harder at parenting. Stick with the gym. It will take time to build the habit again, but you\u2019ll get there.", "NTA.  Going to the gym gives you such energy and good vibes.  Being happy,.healthy and energetic and helping you to stay healthy and strong in the future for $40 a month?  Why not????", "Nta and turn off your phone. *His* child is crying, *he* needs to deal with the baby just like you do.  Is baby hungry? Thirsty? Wants to be held?  Wants to be walked around?\n\nTell him if he thinks you are using it enough, you'll go three times a week, and *he can parent his kid* during that time.", "This is a first I\u2019ve heard someone saying dad called coz baby was crying. She\u2019s 2 ffs. You go to the gym and put on DND. He needs to figure out how to sooth a two year old. His two year old. Done come home next time he calls for that.", "Info:  does your gym charge for casual users?  Unless you are going 3 x week it\u2019s often cheaper to just buy a pass for the one session you do go to.  \n\nThat would also be a good \u201ccompromise\u201d with your husband as it would be cheaper (so better financially).\n\nLastly you do need to the father to actually parent.  I had 3 kids under 3 (no twins) and I\u2019m a Dad who could manage that to let my wife get some away time.", "YTA for insisting on paying for a membership you have not used for two years.", "ESH.

You have to do all the childcare, home chores, work full time, etc etc   What exactly does he bring to the table?  He calls you when she cries. He should be able to handle that.

He's a parent of the child and should be able to calm the child when she cries. Calling you home when the baby cries is controlling behavior that implies that he does not feel he should have to mind the child.
