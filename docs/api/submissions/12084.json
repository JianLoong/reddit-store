Our son has always been a straight-A student, and we've agreed to give him a substantial amount of money to help pay for his education.\n\nHowever, when it came to our daughter, my husband suggested giving her less money than her brother. He said that our daughter isn't as academically gifted as our son, and that we'd be wasting money by investing in her education.\n\nI was really taken aback by this. It's true that our daughter hasn't always been the best student, but I know that she's capable of succeeding in college if she puts her mind to it. More importantly, I don't think it's fair to treat our children differently based on their academic abilities.\n\nI told my husband that I didn't agree with his plan, and we got into a pretty heated argument. He accused me of being too soft on our daughter and not holding her to the same standards as our son, but that's not the case at all. I just believe in giving our children equal opportunities, regardless of their abilities. I think our daughter deserves the same chance to succeed as our son, and I couldn't bear the thought of holding her back because of something as trivial as grades.\n\nIn the end, I stood my ground and refused to give our daughter less money than her brother. My husband eventually backed down, but he said I was stupid and that we'd just be wasting money.\n\nNow I can't help but wonder, am I the asshole in this situation?

It\u2019s really sad that he doesn\u2019t see the value in her getting a college education. When both kids are graduated, no one is going to care what grades they got, ever. I don\u2019t know why her high school grades somehow determine what a waste a college education would be for her. That\u2019s so ridiculous. \n\nAlso, I can\u2019t imagine the amount of pressure your son is put under by your husband. He has such high expectations of your son. What if he doesn\u2019t live up to your husband\u2019s expectations? He clearly thinks your son will really really benefit from getting good grades and going to college. \n\nWhat will happen if the roles get reversed in college and your daughter ends up thriving and your son struggles? Your husband seems so narrow minded and demanding. You are definitely NTA.", "NTA but if your husband really did call you stupid,  then you have a serious issue in your marriage.\n\nYour daughter may not get straight A's or graduate with honors,  but that doesn't mean she'll be less successful.  Besides,  maybe she'll want to go to a trade school instead.", "NTA.  And your husband is an idiot and an AH.  Academics aren\u2019t the end all be all.  And people develop at different rates.\n\nThe fact that he would want to take away from your daughter having a chance to succeed?\n\nScrew him:", "NTA. Respectfully your husband is a dick and an asshole. Favoring your son and his \u201cgifts\u201d while only willing to give your daughter a fraction of that just because he \u201cthinks\u201d she isnt as talented.\n\nThere\u2019s doctors, nurses, engineers, teachers, etc. who have gotten C\u2019s and even failed classes before that doesn\u2019t make them any less worthy of support or financial help if given the luxury. Your husband seems to think he\u2019s a know it all. Dont back down, your daughter needs support and clearly it wont come from him.", "NTA-glad you stood up for your daughter.", "NTA. You are an amazing mom to have in your corner. Bravo for standing up for your daughter! Stay strong and don\u2019t back down.", "NTA\n\nTrouble with education so take away more education? He literally wants to kick her while she's down.\n\nBe honest with yourself: has he favored your son in other ways? I can't help but wonder if her poor performance is in part a result of her being subtly treated worse or being treated with lower expectations.", "NTA. I know heaps of people who weren\u2019t high achievers at high school and have gone on to be very successful. I also have friends who were in the top stream at high school, went to uni and wasted the opportunity. It\u2019s unfair to put your children against each other over education.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your husband straight up said that investing in your daughter\u2019s future and giving her the same chance to succeed as her brother was a stupid waste of money and you think you\u2019re the AH?\n\nThank you for standing up to him. I have a feeling he\u2019s going to rain on her parade when she starts looking at schools, so please continue to stand up for her and give her the support she needs.", "NTA but your husband sounds awfully sexist. It may be that your daughter is not the student that your son is. She still deserves a fair chance and no funny stuff that your husband may rationalize as common sense. It may also be that she could really blossom away from home and do really well. I saw that happen when I taught. But she needs a clear playing field, not parents disagreeing about what she is permitted to have.", "NTA\n\nYou are right to give your children equal opportunities to get a great start in life. \n\nI won't comment about your husband's opinion because I want to keep my comment civil.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you have been soft on your daughter. \n\nHowever it doesn\u2019t make sense to not invest in her education. If she\u2019s capable of getting into university then despite her relative lack of academic ability it\u2019s still very likely she\u2019ll complete her studies with a reasonable degree that, on average, will likely help her career/future earnings.\n\nSo he shouldn\u2019t be worried about failure. If his concern is the usefulness of the specific course she does or going to university in general (perhaps because your son needs the degree for his desired career but she doesn\u2019t) then that could be a legitimate concern because university is often overrated. However he needs to suggest an alternative that provides a better return on investment, otherwise it\u2019s unfair and wrong.\n\nHe needs to get it into his head that the important thing is that your children benefit from the investment in their education, which is highly likely. The exact amount they benefit is of much less importance.", "NTA. All the \u201caverage\u201d students in medical school become doctors.", "NTA. We all have talents of our own, even if others are too stupid to see or acknowledge them.", " NTA, but that statement from your husband was real assholeish. I would have been furious and I\u2019m glad your stood your ground! Treat your children equally or else be ready for your children to resent you and fight with each other.", "NTA - HE wants to give her less money but then claim YOU'RE not holding them to the same standards?! Pick a side dude! Either they get the same amount or they get nothing. Just because a kid doesn't make straight As, doesn't mean they can't be successful in the path they choose.", "NTA. Please treat both children equally. \n\nI went to a state college.\n\nMy sister went to a private college, got some financial aid to bring it down.\n\nMy brother went to a city college.\n\nParents paid for everything. None of us were overachievers, but afforded the same equality based on what we wanted to do. I'm deeply grateful to my parents for doing this for us. If for some reason, I'd known they treated us differently, that would cause resentment among the family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I didn\u2019t do as well as I could have in HS because I was bullied and just didn\u2019t care about school. I just wanted the hours and years to be gone. Went on to college, became a straight A student, earned a full scholarship, and got two advanced degrees. \n\nI don\u2019t care how old they are, high schoolers are still kids and growing up. Your daughter deserves just as much a chance as your son. Good on you for sticking up for her and making sure she gets that chance.", "Nta- but out of curiosity has she been evaluated for adhd? I myself have it and know my favorite studies I\u2019d hyper focus on and the others well\u2026 \nAnother class, art. I loved.

If your son is going to a top school that costs $80,000/year and your husband is advocating for your daughter to go to a community college first to get her grades up, then that is both reasonable and would obviously cost a lot less.  Did he actually say that he wouldn't pay for your daughter to go to college or trade school at all?  Frankly, it makes sense for a less gifted student to go to a lower cost state school.  They can still get a great education that way.  It doesn't make sense for, say, a B-student from California to go to a tier 2 school like Notre Dame (even if they could get in) when they could just go to a UC for about half the money.", "Your husband is the AH. \nI bet your daughter will do well in school.", "Your husband is an ASS.

Your husband, however, is a sexiest dick. \n\nJust because your son is now a straight A student now doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he will be in college. Just because he thinks your daughter isn\u2019t \u201cacademically gifted\u201d doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t bloom in college. \n\nKeep up the good fight for your daughter. Talk with her about her dreams for college. Let her know that you believe in and support her.", "NTA\u2026 thank you for standing up to your daughter! \n\nAs someone who struggled in grade school and high school (barely got a 3.0 GPA and was so unmotivated, consistently got Bs or Cs) I was so grateful that my parents helped support my college education so I could go to my first choice college. My brother has always done a lot better than me in school and I would have been so upset if we didn\u2019t get the same opportunities, especially when I knew that I was always the \u201cdumber sibling\u201d for my entire life. When I got to college and started taking classes that I was genuinely interested in (more creative and project based) it was so much easier for me to be motivated and excited about school. I graduated with a 3.7 GPA and even got a 4.0 for a couple of semesters. It totally may be possible that your daughter just hasn\u2019t found something that she enjoys enough to actually put in the effort for (and you even said yourself that you know she\u2019s capable). She deserves the chance to at least try and explore what\u2019s out there, just like her brother has! \n\nAnd please tell your husband to stop comparing your children- they are their own people, separate from each other. Constant comparison and not getting the same opportunities is going to cause resentment between them and your husband.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is out of line. If both kids graduate, they should both have access to the opportunities that are available to them. I wouldn't fixate on the amount of money for education being equal necessarily, just make sure you contribute to giving each of them their start in life, in a way that makes sense for what they want to do. If you do spend less on one child's education, roll their education savings into savings for a home or a wedding down the road.", "You sure you want to invest in a college degree?", "Is he literally saying paying for their daughter\u2019s education is a waste of money?
