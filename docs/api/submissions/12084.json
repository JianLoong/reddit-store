It may be that your daughter is not the student that your son is. She still deserves a fair chance and no funny stuff that your husband may rationalize as common sense.

If she\u2019s capable of getting into university then despite her relative lack of academic ability it\u2019s still very likely she\u2019ll complete her studies with a reasonable degree that, on average, will likely help her career/future earnings.\n\nSo he shouldn\u2019t be worried about failure. If his concern is the usefulness of the specific course she does or going to university in general (perhaps because your son needs the degree for his desired career but she doesn\u2019t) then that could be a legitimate concern because university is often overrated. However he needs to suggest an alternative that provides a better return on investment, otherwise it\u2019s unfair and wrong.\n\nHe needs to get it into his head that the important thing is that your children benefit from the investment in their education, which is highly likely.

I received an almost full scholarship due to being a straight-A student, both for undergrad and graduate schools Therefore, my sister got substantially more money than me for college. I am not even in the SLIGHTEST bit mad at that. WHY would I be? She's a successful teacher now and her schooling paid off. Lol, I'm not even in any field related to my college education, thankfully I didn't have much debt for it. \n\nBut I don't understand in this case why it would even matter. Maybe he gets scholarships and his money needed is way less, guess what? Take that extra money and invest in her schooling. No child is worth less than the other.", "NTA is this the only time he's favored your son over your daughter?

Both went to college, and now out in the working world my daughter is doing better than my son.   School achademics do not always indicate success after college.", "NTA I was the kid who wasn't \"academically gifted\" infact I was the kid that needed tutoring my entire elementary career, I'm also the only one that started college, and actually stuck it out and got into a career field I choose instead of bailing out and working for mommy or daddy. My sister and brother both AP class takers and still seen as the \"smarter\" of the 4 siblings either flunked out, or couldn't choose a major and only went back at 30yo even then it was motivated by others: my brothers fiance gave him an ultimatum,  my sister went back for her kid, graduated spent less than a year in the industry then went back to working for our mom because it was easier (that doesn't stop her complaining though).\n\nEducation u have to take is different than education you want to take. It motivated u differently. My siblings aren't losers and stupid, I just happen to be very lucky and know what I wanted from the start and work towards that, my siblings lacked direction and simply went where pointed.", "My daughter on paper (report cards) was not as academically gifted as son. We still paid for he 4 year 1st choice school and for a master's (1 extra year). She is doing very well with her life and is just as successful as son.\n\nNTA, but hubs sounds like one !", "Nta you know what a C student and an A student receive at graduation? A diploma.", "NTA. Even if the plan were to base financial assistance to your kids based on their grades, the kids should be aware of that.", "INFO\n\n\nWhat kind of grades are we talking about here? Is your daughter graduating with something like a 1.8 GPA or 3.0+?", "The Google job application, at least, asks for undergraduate GPA.\n\nI don't know what they do with it, and no where else have I been asked that.", "You also never know what'll happen in the future. My sister took AP classes & whatnot, I didn't. My sister worked a few years but quit in 2020 when she got pregnant & is now a SAHM. I have no children & work full time. Most jobs want you to have a college degree even if your degree has no correlation to the job.", "Exactly! I have seen top students in high school struggle in college. I have also seen kids who just barely got into college do well in that environment.\nIt\u2019s also concerning that he called OP stupid.\nNTA.", "This is like the flip side of the dude who asked if he was TA for not supporting his daughter going to CAMBRIDGE because he figures it a foreign school that doesn\u2019t mean much, and her smarter, older brother flunked out of Uni so money on her would be a waste \u2026", "> When both kids are graduated, no one is going to care what grades they got\n\n\n\nThis isn't always true.  My first employer required fresh graduates to have at least a 3.0 GPA.  I remember another intern not being asked back because their GPA fell below that for too many terms as well.\n\n\n\nThis isn't every employer in my field but it also isn't particularly uncommon.\n\n\n\nOnce you have a few years of experience, your GPA matters much less, if at all, but graduating with a 2.0 isn't going to give you the same opportunities as graduating with a 3.5.", "Because he doesn\u2019t care about her succeeding. Strong chance he\u2019s always favored the son because he\u2019s a boy and somehow more worthy. OP is NTA.", "That's my question as well.  I wouldn't commit to spending U of M kind of money on a kid's education if they were a D and C student.\n\n\n\nI'd probably be willing to pay for community college and then university if they did well in community college for a year or two.", "Except they were by no means average students prior to med school. They would have been in the top of their undergrad class.", "I interview for tech jobs and I have never seen or asked about a GPA for anyone that has a bit of experience. For interns I look at the GPA because that's what's there but even for an entry level developer, internships and big class projects are way more important to talk about than comparing GPAs between candidates.", "Not related to this post but devil\u2019s advocate here. From the edit he gave I think he genuinely just didn\u2019t know the ranking of Cambridge and assumed it was a normal college.\n\nI live in Pakistan and most people here don\u2019t know about unis abroad and think they\u2019re all a waste of money because the unis here suck ass. Using her brother as an example was 100% wrong and every child deserves to go to uni if they can afford it.\n\nThis father is just plain evil LMAO. It\u2019s not about which uni or how smart they are, every child deserves education.\n\nI just don\u2019t think the two situations are that comparable", "Sure but your original comment made no reference to high schoolers. Med schools are notorious for having stupid high college requirements. \n\nI agree that poor performance in high school doesn't matter but your comment was comparing apples and trains.", "Nah, I read the comments on that post and that dude was American and sexist and ignorant af, constantly trying to justify himself when ppl corrected him; his comments were one big pile of Yikes. My immediate thought on reading this post was that it was inspired by that one, because both these fathers are terrible, even if they\u2019re being slightly different flavors of sexist.\n\n(Obviously NTA, OP)", "you mean the dad who also knew that she got into multiple ivy League universities and downplayed this as her not getting into the best schools but getting into some good ones \"out of state\"???  \n\neven if he had been wildly ignorant that Cambridge is the second ranked school in the world, there's a difference between ignorance and sticking your head in the sand. your daughter wants to go to this school and you never once even bother to Google it?? \n\nbut nah, dad's intentional ignorance was the tip of the iceberg there\n\nhe knows how good ivy League schools are. he knows enough to know the difference between ivy leagues and ivy League adjacent schools - he said that his daughter got into much better schools than his son and the best school his son got into was Georgetown\n\nand even if he was ignorant about all of that (which he wasn't), he wanted to punish his daughter for his son's mistakes. he thought that she wasn't serious about computer science because she had only been serious about it for 2 years and as we all know, you need to determine your future career at 13 to prove yourself. and then he blamed her for not advocating for herself better and described how she doesn't talk much and whenever she tries to talk to him about something she looks acts like she's scared of him. and so it's her fault for not telling him more and convincing him to research it\n\nthis man literally understands that his daughter is scared to talk to him and still blames her for him being a shitty parent\n\nso yeah, he may be a wildly ignorant American and intentionally ignorant, that's true. but that was really not the problem it was the icing on the cake"]}
