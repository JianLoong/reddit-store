{"id": 24137, "submission_id": "15l2jhu", "title": "AITA for cooking with ingredients my roommate/co-worker is allergic to?", "selftext": "I (F25) have been living with my co-worker (M27; initals CC) for 2 months in our company's house that they had for seasonal workers. Up until 3 weeks ago, my company reimbursed us for some pantry essentials such as cooking oil, spices, and rice. My roommate took advantage of that by buying and eating mainly things that were reimbursed. And he'd buy the boujee organic stuff too. The company found out and ended the reimbursements, so we had to pay for our own food. No big deal for me, since most of the stuff I ate didn't qualify for reimbursements. But that meant that CC would pretty much starve because he doesn't want to spend money on food. Not my problem.\n\nIt became my problem when he started taking my food. Having gone thru 5 years of university I'm no stranger to inconsiderate roommates, but this is the first time anyone's ever stolen from me. CC is allergic to pretty much everything. He's got some rare condition that makes him unable to consume cane sugar, nightshade produce, mushrooms and anything processed by yeast. For the 2 months we've lived together, he would quite often eat my rice if I didn't label the container. Extremely rude of him, but at the end of the day, it's just rice.\n\nThen 3 weeks ago, after our company stopped reimbursing us for pantry items, I bought a bag of rice, made a pot of it, and labeled my container. I came home from work the next day to find all of it gone. CC ate all of my cooked rice. When I confronted him, he got defensive and claimed that \"he didn't know; the company never said anything about ending the reimbursements\". I called him out on his bullshit because our manager called both of us into her office to let us know that the company was ending the house reimbursements. I told him to buy and cook his own damn rice. He ran away crying. Literally, he ran into his room, slammed the door, started bawling his eyes out, and then proceeded to call his parents to complain about how I'm a mean, toxic person and he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nTo prevent him from eating my rice again, I made a pot of it using strained shiitake mushroom liquid. It's just the water leftover from rehydrating dried shiitake mushrooms. I put the leftover rice in a couple of labeled containers. Today, I came home from work to him curled up in pain on the sofa. I asked him how he liked that mushroom liquid I used in my rice and he had a huge break down. He accused me of \"poisoning\" him, of how I knew he couldn't eat mushroom products and yet I cooked rice with it anyways, and how he'd file charges against me for poisoning him. He ended up filing a complaint to HR and my manager about the whole ordeal, and now I have a meeting with both of them tomorrow afternoon to discuss what happened.\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: \n\nHe was faking it the whole time! Heard him laughing over the phone in his room about how he's gonna have the whole place to himself by next week and that he can't believe I fell for it.", "created_utc": 1691455305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l2jhu/aita_for_cooking_with_ingredients_my/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You asked him to stop and he didn\u2019t. Both times, the food was labeled as yours. I don\u2019t get the E S H judgements. If he has food allergies, he\u2019s irresponsible for eating food that he didn\u2019t prepare. You shouldn\u2019t have to label your food based on his allergies. Hell, you shouldn\u2019t even have to label it with your name cause surely he knows what food he bought / made versus what food you bought / made.", "NTA but be careful with food allergies.

He needs to keep his sticky fingers off your food!", "ESH He shouldn't be eating your food, but I think you can get into legal trouble for internationally contaminating food. You knew he was going to eat it and essentially poisoned him. Will he eat your food again?  No, probably not.

You even labelled it. You confronted him and he still didn't stop eating it. He did bring it on himself. I'm tempted to say NTA.

Wtf", "Agreed esh if you labeled it mushroom rice then maybe nta but you where trying to reach him a lesson.", "He does not.

If you're that allergic, you don't shovel food in your face you didn't prepare yourself.  My 10 year old niece has a couple significant allergies and she's known not to eat random food since she was 4 so as to not poison *herself*.  Roommate did this to himself."]}
