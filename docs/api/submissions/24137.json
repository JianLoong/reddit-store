{"id": 24137, "submission_id": "15l2jhu", "title": "AITA for cooking with ingredients my roommate/co-worker is allergic to?", "selftext": "I (F25) have been living with my co-worker (M27; initals CC) for 2 months in our company's house that they had for seasonal workers. Up until 3 weeks ago, my company reimbursed us for some pantry essentials such as cooking oil, spices, and rice. My roommate took advantage of that by buying and eating mainly things that were reimbursed. And he'd buy the boujee organic stuff too. The company found out and ended the reimbursements, so we had to pay for our own food. No big deal for me, since most of the stuff I ate didn't qualify for reimbursements. But that meant that CC would pretty much starve because he doesn't want to spend money on food. Not my problem.\n\nIt became my problem when he started taking my food. Having gone thru 5 years of university I'm no stranger to inconsiderate roommates, but this is the first time anyone's ever stolen from me. CC is allergic to pretty much everything. He's got some rare condition that makes him unable to consume cane sugar, nightshade produce, mushrooms and anything processed by yeast. For the 2 months we've lived together, he would quite often eat my rice if I didn't label the container. Extremely rude of him, but at the end of the day, it's just rice.\n\nThen 3 weeks ago, after our company stopped reimbursing us for pantry items, I bought a bag of rice, made a pot of it, and labeled my container. I came home from work the next day to find all of it gone. CC ate all of my cooked rice. When I confronted him, he got defensive and claimed that \"he didn't know; the company never said anything about ending the reimbursements\". I called him out on his bullshit because our manager called both of us into her office to let us know that the company was ending the house reimbursements. I told him to buy and cook his own damn rice. He ran away crying. Literally, he ran into his room, slammed the door, started bawling his eyes out, and then proceeded to call his parents to complain about how I'm a mean, toxic person and he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nTo prevent him from eating my rice again, I made a pot of it using strained shiitake mushroom liquid. It's just the water leftover from rehydrating dried shiitake mushrooms. I put the leftover rice in a couple of labeled containers. Today, I came home from work to him curled up in pain on the sofa. I asked him how he liked that mushroom liquid I used in my rice and he had a huge break down. He accused me of \"poisoning\" him, of how I knew he couldn't eat mushroom products and yet I cooked rice with it anyways, and how he'd file charges against me for poisoning him. He ended up filing a complaint to HR and my manager about the whole ordeal, and now I have a meeting with both of them tomorrow afternoon to discuss what happened.\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: \n\nHe was faking it the whole time!

And then bring up that after the overheard conversation and the constant theft and the fact that he deliberately ate something labeled as containing his allergen just so he could try to get you disciplined that you don't feel safe rooming with him anymore.", "You should have recorded that.", "I dislike many types of mushrooms and can often taste even small traces of mushrooms in food. Especially when it comes to foods such as rice, which do not have an intense taste of their own.", "But she didn\u2019t do that. There\u2019s no \u201cpoison\u201d involved, just an ingredient she can eat that he can\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t make it poison.", "You\u2019re sure they\u2019re willing to be accomplices for you? What you did was illegal, so they\u2019ll be sharing the punishment if y\u2019all get caught.", "It\u2019s illegal. You can\u2019t booby trap food, just like you can\u2019t booby trap a property to keep people from trespassing.", "I don't think keeping/ smoking weed in company housing is a good look either. I'd casually mention that during your talk.", "Uhhh ackshullyyy the manslaughter charges wouldn't specifically say poisoning", "If food allergies are nothing to mess around with, why is he playing fast and loose with his?", "This. All OP has to have done, imo, to avoid an accusation that this was on purpose to harm him would have been to label the container mushroom rice.\n\nIf they only labelled it as theirs knowing their allergic roommate steals their food, it doesnt matter that the roommate shouldn't be stealing, preventing food theft is not a situation where potentially lethal force (because idk if OP ever got told what his allergic reaction was, but for loads of allergies its anaphalyxsis) is a reasonable response.", "Because he's a dumbass asshole?\n\nObviously he's very much at fault here. I'm just saying that him being a dumbass asshole doesn't excuse OP from what very well could have been attempted murder.", "Depends on the person.  I know someone with a nightshade allergy and potatoes are iffy for him.  Depends on the kind of potato, for the most part.", "So by this logic, if I bake some peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, and a robber with a peanut allergy breaks into my house and eats them, I'm criminally responsible for his allergy to the stolen food?", "I\u2019m the same with peanuts!! I can\u2019t breath if I eat actual peanuts but turn it into peanut butter and I\u2019m fine!", "For sure, that would be why I said \"many\" and not \"all\".", "Me too! That devil fruit will give me the worst heartburn, but banana bread, pudding, cream pie.....all good. Weird.", "Cooked onion? Fucking nothing, just fine. Raw onion? Bubble guts and misery for a couple days. Bodies are weird", "Eh, depends on what the oral allergy is reacting to.  If it's a ragweed allergy, heat doesn't help neutralize the pollen on cumin.\n\nWhich, btw, is why a lot of people react poorly to Mexican and Indian food when they eat it.  Ragweed grows in cumin fields, and is very difficult to clean off the seeds before they're processed into cumin powder.", "ESH. Obviously your roommate sucks, but you pretty much did try to poison him which is awful. It would be N T A if you had used mushroom water to make your rice and told him explicitly that the rice contained mushrooms- boom, he doesn't eat it. Your rice is protected, you're happy and he doesn't have an allergic reaction. However, you say that he guessed about the mushroom water because he saw the mushrooms, not because you told him. Him stealing your food makes him an AH, but it doesn't give you the right to try to physically harm him. If the point was to stop him stealing, you'd have told him, but the point was to hurt him.\n\nReminds me of some show where a woman's husband kept eating food when she'd asked him not to. So she puts a poisoned dessert in the fridge. He eats it and dies. Her defence was \"I told him not to eat it!\"", "NTA.  Going to NEED an update!", "NTA - I mean, you didn't use the shittake mushroom liquid when cooking the rice, that could damage your cooking utensils and that'd be silly! You just lied to him to make his stomach upset because you're sick of him stealing your food, clearly; how's he going to prove otherwise? ;)", "NTA, he just wants free food. How is he going to cope having to pay for everything if he has the place to himself?\n\nFully sympathise with food being stolen. Its heartbreaking looking forward to a certain meal you have in the fridge only to come home to find it gone.", "NTA", "NTA defend yourself to HR. You labeled your food, which means labeling was for you and everybody to know who it was for. It was for you. Not your fault if he is allergic to things. Its an allergic persons own self preservation to ask someone what the ingredient is. \n\nIf he says that you knew about his allergy, tell them yes and thats why you labeled it. Doesnt matter if you labeled it with mushrooms or not. You labeled it yours so everybody needs to mind their own business not their food, not their concern. \n\nThen file a counter report tohim on HR. Tell them he just wants the room to himself. Tell then he has been s tealing food but you kept labeling it yours because of sense of responsibility. And if they question back to the mushrooms. Tell them you love the flavor with your cooked rice and suspect workmate faked it.", "Record record record", "I think you should have reported him for stealing your food ages ago, but bring up every instance you can at this meeting. \n\nPoint out how he ruined the food reimbursement program for everyone by taking the absolute piss as well.", "Make sure it is also mentioned that you label your food so that your co-worker wouldn't accidentally eat it, out of fear of him having a reaction to it. The fact alone that it was labeled, matters a lot. He knows he didn't make that food or buy it, he was stealing.", "One thing that might help is if you framed it so that it *affects the company*. Some possible examples: \n\n\"CC clearly doesn't think stealing from coworkers is a big deal. If he's stealing from me/us, who's to say he isn't stealing from the company?\"\n\n\"Do you want the liability of having such a person as an employee?\"\n\n\"He blatantly lied about his allergic reaction. What else is he lying about? His productivity? His qualifications? His work?\"\n\nIf you make him *their* problem (and not just yours), they're more likely to act.\n\nAs an aside, this is just mind-boggling coming from a 27-year-old. :-o\n\n>Literally, he ran into his room, slammed the door, started bawling his eyes out, and then proceeded to call his parents to complain about how I'm a mean, toxic person and he didn't do anything wrong.", "My husband is a software developer in the US. His company has an apartment for new hires. They can live there up to like 6 months while finding local housing.", "I feel like you didn\u2019t even read my comment\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between keeping the kitchen allergen free, and purposely not telling their roommate there\u2019s mushrooms in food op assumed they would try to eat", "I have a nightshade allergy and potatoes make me the sickest. I have to be extremely careful to avoid anything with potato starch in it.", "It's so nice to hear of someone else with that specific allergy. I always get weird looks when I'm out at a restaurant and ask if the tomatoes in a dish were fresh or processed.", "I\u2019m this way too! Potatoes and anything with potato starch make me extremely sick. But I do also react to the other nightshades (bell peppers are bad). Potatoes are by far the worst for me though", "The first word of my comment is \u201cknowingly\u201d- so your analogy is a little far off\n\nIt would\u2019ve been fine if OP made mushroom rice and their roommate just stole it\n\nOr even if OP intentionally added mushroom oil to deter their roommate *while still telling them*\n\nBut how OP post reads is that they intentionally didn\u2019t tell their roommate fully expecting them to try eat it", "I can't eat actual nuts either, but yeah, once it's smooth like peanut butter (i can't do chunky) I'm good.", "She told him \"to buy and cook his own damn rice\".  He was warned not to eat food that didn't belong to him.  Not her fault he didn't listen.", "NTA.\n\nSaw the edit. Did you record it, by any chance? Because you know he's going to deny it.\n\nDo *not* say anything to HR that might indicate you deliberately used mushroom liquid because you knew he was allergic. Only that you made it that way because *you* like it, and you made it for yourself, and it was labelled, and you are not responsible for altering your diet to accommodate his thieving.", "JAM (justified asshole move). it would've been better if you told him to ask you first before eating some rice, but i guess going the silent \"fuck around and find out\" path is also an option. also, faking allergies?! that's so low, dude!", "[removed]", "NTA. CC is a huge AH and you need to report him for his terrible behavior should you have a meeting with \"HR.\" Explain how he took advantage of your employer's goodwill and how he stole your pantry items and ate them himself.", "NTA, as your edit illustrates.", "So is he admitting to your work that he stole your food? Cause that is theft. And since it is company housing, it is work theft. He is stealing from work. \n\nSomeone is going to have the place to themselves, but it wont be him. \n\nMake sure you let HR know that you make yourself food, and that it was clearly labeled as yours. You had and CC had no-sharing food policy set since you moved in, so him stealing and eating your food was not something you would ever think of, as you did not know he was capable of theft from a fellow employee. \n\nNTA", "He is 27 yr old and ran to his room.crying to call mommy to tell on you? Holy crap. That is an embarrassing story for him. Hope all goes well. NTA.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely insane how many people think 0P should cater to his roommates allergies.  Especially since the guy is supposedly allergic to everything. What, is he supposed to get a list of his roommates allergies for grocery shopping purposes and spend his own money on groceries his roommate isn\u2019t allergic to. This isn\u2019t a shared potluck dish or food at a dinner party. This is his own damn food he cooked for himself.\n\nI\u2019ve never known anybody with severe food allergies that just goes around, eating other peoples food willy-nilly. It\u2019s pretty simple don\u2019t eat your roommates food.", "Yeah I need an update to this expeditiously", "What if you tell them not to eat it?
