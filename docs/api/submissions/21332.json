You brought a problem to the server and he dismissed it outright. That\u2019s not doing his job. The only resolutions at that point were tipping it him, not tipping, or getting the manager.

There was a well established, famous name brand family restaurant in our town for years. Served pancakes as it\u2019s calling card!!!\ud83d\ude09 Had been fine for the 15 or so yrs till original manager retired. New manager was not big (per waitress/hostesses) on loose change. He started making the employees \u201cround up/down\u201d to wear you were only getting bills back. Didn\u2019t go over well in certain crowds. It\u2019s not like the waitresses were profiting from the rounding up or down. But I agreed with my dad at the time. Even if it\u2019s only eight cents or $.17 or $.23, over a days time, then times a week that rounding up and down Can add up to some major extra change for the restaurant. After grumbling and complaint calls, corporate was sent in to do an audit. The manager was gone in a matter of days and things got back to normal. You work for your money, your pay for what you got, and you get your change back, that\u2019s just the bottom line.", "Servers make $2.31/hr in the US.", "I'm guessing they don't get medical care either? :(", "That is absolutely appalling.\n\nThis needs to be taken up with the establishment/restaurant owners to pay a decent hourly wage. A server should NEVER expect the consumer to bear that cost.\n\nSomehow, I think the US government should get involved in this as well.", "Technically if they don't make minimum wage after tips are counted in the restaurant is supposed to make up the difference, but most restaurants have a pretty toxic culture and few of them actually follow that rule.", "Nope", "The customer absolutely should bear the cost, who else would. But the cost should be included in the cost of the meals so servers could make a consistent and higher wage.", "NTA. Servers took their tip when they short-changed you. Heck, I'm all for tips but hate it when they short change me.", "Nta", ",", "I agree that the UK has a better approach to tipping and the person should not have berated you.

California has minimum wage of $15.50 before tips. There are also a few other states that require minimum wage to be calculated before tips. \n\nIn general though, most of the states have crappy laws regarding minimum wage (including for servers).", "who do you think approved the federal tipping wage in the US?"]}
