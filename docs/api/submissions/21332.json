There was a well established, famous name brand family restaurant in our town for years. Served pancakes as it\u2019s calling card!!!\ud83d\ude09 Had been fine for the 15 or so yrs till original manager retired. New manager was not big (per waitress/hostesses) on loose change. He started making the employees \u201cround up/down\u201d to wear you were only getting bills back. Didn\u2019t go over well in certain crowds. It\u2019s not like the waitresses were profiting from the rounding up or down. But I agreed with my dad at the time. Even if it\u2019s only eight cents or $.17 or $.23, over a days time, then times a week that rounding up and down Can add up to some major extra change for the restaurant. After grumbling and complaint calls, corporate was sent in to do an audit. The manager was gone in a matter of days and things got back to normal. You work for your money, your pay for what you got, and you get your change back, that\u2019s just the bottom line.", "Servers make $2.31/hr in the US.", "I'm guessing they don't get medical care either? :(", "That is absolutely appalling.\n\nThis needs to be taken up with the establishment/restaurant owners to pay a decent hourly wage. A server should NEVER expect the consumer to bear that cost.\n\nSomehow, I think the US government should get involved in this as well.", "Technically if they don't make minimum wage after tips are counted in the restaurant is supposed to make up the difference, but most restaurants have a pretty toxic culture and few of them actually follow that rule.", "Nope", "The customer absolutely should bear the cost, who else would. But the cost should be included in the cost of the meals so servers could make a consistent and higher wage.", "NTA. Servers took their tip when they short-changed you. Heck, I'm all for tips but hate it when they short change me.", "Nta", ",", "I agree that the UK has a better approach to tipping and the person should not have berated you. To be honest, the situation you described doesn't always warrant a tip. Tipping has really ballooned in recent years.", "Really hoping you don\u2019t live in the US", "Well the subminimum wage (tipped wage that servers make) hasn\u2019t really gone up over the years while the minimum wage and costs of living have, so tipped workers really have to rely on big tips.", "Not in every state. California has minimum wage of $15.50 before tips. There are also a few other states that require minimum wage to be calculated before tips. \n\nIn general though, most of the states have crappy laws regarding minimum wage (including for servers).", "who do you think approved the federal tipping wage in the US?", "Was the $31 after tax, or before?  Because another $3 or so on top of that sounds like the difference that tax would make.", "NTA, they got their tip in a crappy way.  \nAlthough I generally tip, I've not when the service has been pretty bad without good reason.  \nAs in, it's slammed busy they are obviously short staffed, it's not the servers fault and I'm not going to punish them. If it's dead and the service sucks, that's a different story.  \nBeing in western Canada though, tipping in some places in town has got out of hand, one place I no longer go to made the default tip 30% and also made it very difficult to change to a lower amount.

I could understand just taking the $2 out of what you intended to tip, which 15% would be around $4.50... so you could just left $2.50 i guess and not been the AH...\n\nBut if you took all the change, YTA... that $2 works out to 6% tip... that's pretty stingy...", "If he didn\u2019t bother to hash it out then no tip.

Starbucks has started asking for tips. Like i get it if theyre not getting min wage but geez. When i used to go to buffets i never tipped because i was getting my own food and theyre pretty bad at refilling drinks. The last two times we have gone they cornered us as we left demanding a tip. Like what?\n\nNTA op.

The service had been slow all night and we left a tip of about 10%, which I thought was pretty generous in rhe circumstances. The server took the tip and we were still sitting finishing off our drinks when the manager came over, and without a word sat himself down at our table and asked us what was wrong with our meal.\n\nThis struck me then (and now) as pretty rude behaviour, but I remained polite, and informed him that the service had been slow, we had had to repeat our drink orders on a couple of occasions as they hadn't turned up, and we didn't feel the meal was worth more than we tipped. Aside from his rude approach I didn't see anything remarkable up totally his point. I have no problem explaining what I feel is wrong with service and why I tipped as I did\n\nThe manager then proceeded to launch into a whole sob story on behalf of his servers, how they were on minimum wage, and that wasn't enough to live on, and they needed tips to get by, and we as tourists must be able to afford to tip more. It was a real attempt at laying on a guilt trip really thick.\n\nBut to me it just emphasised the entitlement of the management of the US hospitality sector. These are the people who are choosing to pay their staff sub standard wages, and on top of the list price (which wasn't really any less than it would have been in the UK) they feel entitled to demand an additional 20% to top up their failure to take care of their staff.\n\nThis has been going on so long that it has become normalised throughout the industry. This expectation that customers should pay over the odds to subsidise poor management who don't take care of their staff.", "Not in Oregon and Washington.

Friend of mine has cooked there 30ish years, he has insurance, a 401k, paid vacation, and had stock option offer when he started (I don't think they still do that). Most restaurants, only managers get benefits.", "No, they don't.", "Man, when I was a server at $2.13/hr, I would make bank \ud83e\udd11\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0. Got me through college. The money is either going to be included in the food price or the tip. The customer has to pay for that regardless. But if you're good, you can make serious money, even at mid-level restaurants. Don't knock it until you understand it. It's different everywhere you go, but there is no perfect system to change this yet. Yes, it varies state by state, but those with the lower minimum wage get taxed a LOT less than Oregon and California where servers get paid more. They also have a way higher cost of living.", "https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped", "Ah, I see. I find those situations irritating mostly because there is no transparency about where those tips go and often don\u2019t actually go the people making minimum wage but instead go to higher ups who didn\u2019t actually interact with the customers. \n\nI just wish the sub-minimum wage was abolished already since servers so frequently get stiffed by people who don\u2019t understand they aren\u2019t making a living wage or simply don\u2019t care.", "In the past 2 years several Bay Area restaurants tried to pay servers a living wage and enforce a no-tips policy. Instead the food prices reflected the actual cost of service.\n\n They had to give it up because the public would not accept the higher prices and they lost too much business.\n\nAmericans love to bitch about tipping, and claim to support servers being paid a living wage, but won't put their money where their mouth is.", "Thank you.\n\nBased on the chart, it is basically southern/lower midwestern states that adhere to the federal minimum. The difference between red and blue states is telling.", "So we\u2019re ignoring the fact that\u2019s just the required federal amount? That all the states on the list that pay under minimum, pay the employee extra if tips don\u2019t get them to minimum? Like I think it\u2019s bullshit how little servers get paid, but acting as if they actually flat out are paid that amount, when it\u2019s just the required federal, and linking to page showing that a bunch of this states do not even give that little??\n\nI do not understand the obsession on this sub with downvotes even when people are technically agreeing with you.", "Yeah I agree. For the record I'm a good tipper. I just noticed there's an uptick in places that expect a tip, at least in my areas. It didn't used to be standard to tip at somewhere like a bakery, for example.

Just in less fancy clothes.\n\nThe system doesn't make sense and CEOs have just found a villainize their customers instead of paying a fair wage.\nAn incredible psychological feat actually.", "The employers often \\_don't\\_ make up the difference: \"But servers complain many restaurants often skimp on topping off their pay if they don't make enough in tips.\"  \n[https://www.npr.org/2021/03/20/977958521/so-how-should-your-favorite-restaurant-pay-its-servers-well-its-complicated](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/20/977958521/so-how-should-your-favorite-restaurant-pay-its-servers-well-its-complicated)  \n\n\nThen there are other ways restaurant employers rip servers off: https://paycheckcollector.com/legal-center-for-restaurant-employees/common-violations/", "Which is a big part of why I think the sub minimum wage should not exist, consumers don\u2019t have an easy way of knowing how much their server is making. Unfortunately most US states do pay the sub minimum wage to servers, so I always tip my servers since I don\u2019t know how much they are making and I\u2019m really not too concerned about my server making too much money. I consider it part of the cost of eating out.", "Yeah, I don't understand why it's not baked into the price like every other service or product. I know someone who owns a restaurant and offered to raise a base salary or stick to tips. He says his employees chose to stick to tips.\nSo it also seems that some servers like their pay being at the mercy of customers due to the upside.\nBut I think that's because most of us are already guilted into tipping despite the level of service (or even if you get served at all in a couple of my experiences)."]}
