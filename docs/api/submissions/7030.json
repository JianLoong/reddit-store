He invited her to his family's holiday celebrations, and she had an amazing time. She asked us to make her boyfriend's first time meeting us special. I convinced my dad to make reservations at a really nice restaurant, where we could all get dressed up.\n\nMy mom, sister and I were so excited to put on our fancy clothes and go out, and my dad was excited too, but our brother had very little interest. Our mom had to make him change twice. At the restaurant, we met the new boyfriend. He was very sweet and cute. He was very nice to all of us. Our brother showed very little interest in him.\n\nWhen my dad asked what the boyfriend did, he said he was a linguist and worked at a publishing house proofreading translations. At this point my brother perked up. He asked if the boyfriend could show a \"manuscript he'd been working on\" to \"people at the office.\" The boyfriend became uncomfortable and explained he didn't work with that arm of the publishing house. They didn't work with original works, just translations.\n\nMy brother began whining and pleading that he at least \"flip through\" the manuscript. Eventually the boyfriend gave my brother his email, but he looked very uncomfortable and the vibe of the night was ruined. Although the original plan was for everyone to return to our family home for a nightcap, the boyfriend said he needed to get up early so had to get some sleep. He and my sister left together, and the rest of us returned home.\n\nAt home I told my brother off for his behavior. He said he was \"networking\" and I \"wouldn't understand.\" I said all he did was embarrass our family on a night that was important to our sister. I said he was self-centered, and if I ever find anyone special, I won't introduce my brother to them. My brother called me a condescending bitch.\n\nMy mom said I went too far, especially since I wasn't the originally injured party. I felt he needed a wakeup call.

But I think calling out your brother for pestering someone to the point of giving in when the evening wasn\u2019t about your brother or him networking is a fair critique. And frankly he deserves for the people in his life to point out when he commits such a social faux pas and ruins the evening for not just your sister\u2019s bf, but for her and everyone else as plans got canceled as a result of your brothers behavior. \n\nIf you hadn\u2019t gone so far I might suggest that your brother reach out and apologize but I think given what you said it may not be appropriate for you to be the one to bring it up. \n\nFor clarification this is on the \u201cI won\u2019t introduce you to any of my future partners\u201d section of your argument.\n\nAlso what is with your parents. I would have kiboshed that even with my sister or with a friend I have a close relationship with  if I noticed things getting to that point. Why didn\u2019t they diffuse your brothers pestering. Or even apologize on behalf of him?\n\n\nEdit to change vote: op said her brother is 23 and frequently is rude.", "NTA. He's 23. He's old enough to accept a polite decline", "NTA, but would have been better if you said it at dinner! Your brother sounds like a spoiled loser. Let me guess: he doesn't have a job, doesn't go to school, lives with your parents and contributes nothing to the household.", "\"it's networking, you wouldn't understand\" .... No, it's not. The key factor in networking is to ensure the other person has a *positive* opinion of you. \n\nGet your brother a copy of \"how to win friends and influence people\" and tell him if he wants to \"network\" maybe he better up his social skills and learn to read people better. Sign it \"the condescending bitch\". \n\nESH, you should let him fail on his own, leaning towards NTA mostly because he reacted so poorly.", "NTA. There's a time and place for everything, and that definitely wasn't the time nor the place to impose himself upon his sister's date.Your brother is ill-mannered, tacky, and rude. His manuscript will go straight into the trash after that display of attitude. Somebody has to tell him and you only did what a sister would do-called him out, and rightly so.", "NTA but struggling to see why the brother was there in the first place he clearly wasn\u2019t interested in coming why not just let him stay at home ?", "NTA", "NTA", "Not where I thought this was going when I got to \"linguist\".  ESH though, everyone acted oddly.", "NAH. Yes you crossed a line, but it was with the best intentions. Yes he made everyone uncomfortable, but he was networking thought the BF probably has some connections. People networking awkwardly can be uncomfortable. Instead of tearing your brother down maybe help him instead. Work with him on how to network and find someone to read his manuscript.", "Where are his parents to check his behavior. They're the real assholes. They should have check his behavior at the restaurant when he was doing it. \nThe parents are the asshole. Yta.", "She said he was wrong too, but that I shouldn't have antagonized him.", "On my own part I was too embarrassed, and my brother has a habit of raising his voice and talking over people if they \"interrupt\" him, and I didn't want to cause that.", "I\u2019m an author. I was at a con once and someone tried to slide their manuscript under the stall door of my friend who is an agent. This is not networking. This is a huge boundary stomp, and this brother reminds me of that lady.", "I think you may have misunderstood OP as I first did too... The brother wanted the boyfriend to pass brother's manuscript to people at the publishing house...\n\nWhen I first read it it sounded like the brother was expecting the bf to share works/manuscripts the publishing house were working on...

He is 23.", "Im not too familiar with the bfs job but can you explain how the brother was networking because from my understanding ithiught he just wanted to see the boyfriends job", "Also someone who used to work in publishing.  I found that these people who think they're \"networking\" are also terrible writers.\n\nI'm going NTA though.", "Yes, his mannerisms changed afterwards, and he cancelled the pre-existing plans to return to our home after dinner.\n\nHe was fine before that.\n\nThis is not abnormal for my brother, but I did feel it was particularly egregious in light of our sister's request to make the night special for her boyfriend.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s considered socially awkward when you can clearly see if it\u2019s irritating someone and you keep pushing boundaries", "NTA. Bro is an adult, not a teenager.", "I\u2019m curious how you came to that conclusion- I read it as he was sulking he had to attend a family function he wasn\u2019t interested in", "Where did she say he was socially awkward? Did I miss something? This just read to me like he was being a jerk and being rude.", "The boy is 23 years old. This behavior isn't even acceptable for A TEENAGER", "He works at CVS", "What do you mean? What's the implication of him being a linguist?", "How is you calling out your brothers rude behavior antagonizing him? You held him accountable for his actions. \n\nI may not have gone with the \u201cI won\u2019t introduce you to any of my partners in the future\u201d but other than that I think it was a fair reaction. \n\nHe made someone else uncomfortable and as a result you as well. Good on you for supporting your sister and acknowledging that the situation created by your brother was inappropriate.", "I suggested it to another commenter then realized I should just mention it directly to you. You should just reach out to your sister and let her know you realize dinner was awkward and you would like to get coffee with her and her bf as a redo so that you can get to know him. I think it will go a long way to making her and her bf feel a lot better about the evening since they cut it short.", "Ok so he is generally rude then smh I get the feeling your parents enable him a bit if they are trying to act like you are at fault here.

While I get your brother for maybe not being interested. His was of networking clearly was not wanted my the BF.

Your sibling, you are always going to argue.", "Yeah your understanding is wildly inaccurate.\n\nHe didn't want to see the bf's job. The bf works at a publishing company (though in an arm that focuses exclusively on translations). The brother has written a manuscript (likely a book of some kind) that he wanted to force onto the bf to show around at work. Which isn't remotely how these kinds of things are done. If brother wants to get published he needs to get an agent, not pressure somebody who doesn't even do publishing to circulate his gf's brothers shitty novel.", "NTA.  Sometimes people have to learn their place in the social strata the hard way. I'd imagine there will be more of this next time bf and brother are around each other.

It's really rude to whine and plead for someone to read your manuscript. And it's just plain dumb to do all this to someone who doesn't even work in publishing original works!", "NTA Nagging someone to look at your book even though their company doesn't publish that kind of book isn't \"networking,\" it's being a pushy asshole and making the worst possible impression.", "YTA.", "Oh dear. I thought he was like, 16. I already thought NTA, but his actual age really seals the deal there. Additionally, is this how your mother/other family usually responds? With the whole, you went too far, don't antagonize him thing?  If so, sounds like he might either be the Golden Child (he can do no wrong) or the Missing Stair (he can do wrong, but that's just how he is and we have to work around it). \n\nAlso, I totally understand not saying something in the moment and not wanting to cause a big scene (which also makes your mom's comments even more nonsensical because at least you didn't call him out in front of everybody), but hopefully you can meet with them separately? Make sure that new boyfriend still feels welcome without \"networking\" strings attached?", "How does chastising your brother after the fact help anything?  ESH", "I'm sorry what?! I thought he was something like 12/14 I which case I would have say teen behavior bullshit but it's good to be put back in place ...\nBut he is 23 WTF, he needed more than being put in place by OP if he's this old and act like this!\n\nOP you NTA, your brother needs a reality check", "His behavior was rude, he should have asked that privately.

Brother is an embarrassment. Dude has no shame. There is a time and place.", "NTA. If your brother wants his manuscript to be published he should send queries to agents. If the agents sign him on as a client, they will send his writing to publishers. There are also independent publishers who don't require agents, but even they have specific submission guidelines.

I promise you, giving a script to the janitor that sweeps the studio lot won't get a movie made.  Offering your services as a financial consultant to the IT department won't get you an interview.  Showing off your dance moves to a musicians security guard won't get you a job in their next video.

Imagine 'networking' with your sisters new boyfriend the first time you meet them. He was definitely embarrassing.", "Because people like this don't give up. He'll send that email.
