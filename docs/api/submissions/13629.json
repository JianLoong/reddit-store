Not everyone believes in the same religion and everyone has different religous beliefs or has no religous belief at all.", "NTA\n\nLmao, it's not like you told her \"Well, I believe we're all going into the black void!\" or \"I believe your God is a LIE perpetuated by the evil!\"\n\nYu just told her people have other beliefs.\n\nHer mom sounds like a major asshole if the very concept of differing beliefs is something she didn't want her daughter to know.", "NTA.  Some of us think religion is make believe stories that encourage blind devotion.  Anyone who asks me about my religious believes gets 'I'm a second generation atheist'", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely correct.  It is ok to believe in whatever someone wants to. It is not ok to force it on them. Let her mom be mad all she wants to. You don\u2019t have to conform to someone else\u2019s belief system and you shouldn\u2019t have to to make them comfortable.  Had the daughter just bowed her head and silently prayed, that\u2019s great. But forcing it on others or coercing them to participate is wrong.", "NTA and I think you approached this with a lot of care and grace. Her Mom has a lot of bad days ahead of this is how she intends to deal with differences in her daughter\u2019s life.", "NTA\n\nJust wait until her mother finds out that some people who pray don't believe hell exists.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how old your niece is, but it\u2019s honestly never too early to teach someone about respecting other people\u2019s beliefs, just as I\u2019m sure she wants her beliefs to be respected. While I am absolutely fine with someone having a religion they believe in, I am not okay with someone attempted to convert me. \n\nWe have one nun in a family of \u2018heathens\u2019. She visits once a year or so, and is honestly a riot. Because most of the family was raised in a catholic household (mom and her siblings are in their 60\u2019s-70\u2019s), they are able to carry on a conversation about religion, but the nun never forces anything. \n\nThe last family dinner we had with her was right after two family members died tragically. The only surviving family member from that part of the family was staying with my parents for a while after losing his wife and only son. When we sat down for dinner, she asked the table if it was okay for her to say a prayer before eating. Although none of us are religious, we know it would provide her comfort, as my mom\u2019s youngest sister (who died) and her were very close. \n\nEven my step-father, who absolutely loathes organized religious, bowed his head for prayer. She knew none of us were religious, so she asked out of respect for the group. And we showed her that same respect in return. \n\nWhat your niece did was demand it from others, because that\u2019s how her upbringing told her to do. This is a lesson that should be learned, unless she wants to alienate everyone she meets who doesn\u2019t share her beliefs. \n\n\u201cI know religion is very important to you And your family.

Mom needs to address the everyone has to prayer before eating - everyone has to do as she believes.  I come from a family where we have all kinds of different religions/views.  I have personally told a cousin that myself - though my aunt was good with it and told her daughter I was right, different religions/beliefs and not everyone is going to do/believe as everyone else.\n\nWhat does she think is going to happen when her child is out in public and tries that?  A lot of people are pretty easy going about it but will not comply and some are very rude about it.  It is best she learns with family than out in public where it could get pretty heated these days.", "NTA- it\u2019s the truth. And it\u2019s important to realize that there are many belief systems and they are deserving of respect. \n\nThis is close to me right now because my kid\u2019s school friend has been told by her mother than she isn\u2019t allowed to be friends with him any more because we\u2019re an atheist family.

Nobody should try to impose their beliefs on others regardless of if they believe in God or not.\n\nYou weren't trying to change her views on if there is a God or not but just pointed out that other people have different views.

In return she needs to respect yours as well.", "NTA, you told the truth and didn't make a mockery of whatever religion her mother has her believing.", "NTA. Her mom is a judgemental fuckwad.", "NTA - Pierce the veil of indoctrination as soon as you can.
