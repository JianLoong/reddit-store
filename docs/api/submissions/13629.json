Not everyone believes in the same religion and everyone has different religous beliefs or has no religous belief at all.", "NTA\n\nLmao, it's not like you told her \"Well, I believe we're all going into the black void!\" or \"I believe your God is a LIE perpetuated by the evil!\"\n\nYu just told her people have other beliefs.\n\nHer mom sounds like a major asshole if the very concept of differing beliefs is something she didn't want her daughter to know.", "NTA.  Some of us think religion is make believe stories that encourage blind devotion.  Anyone who asks me about my religious believes gets 'I'm a second generation atheist'", "NTA. You\u2019re absolutely correct.  It is ok to believe in whatever someone wants to. It is not ok to force it on them. Let her mom be mad all she wants to. You don\u2019t have to conform to someone else\u2019s belief system and you shouldn\u2019t have to to make them comfortable.

Her Mom has a lot of bad days ahead of this is how she intends to deal with differences in her daughter\u2019s life.", "NTA\n\nJust wait until her mother finds out that some people who pray don't believe hell exists.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how old your niece is, but it\u2019s honestly never too early to teach someone about respecting other people\u2019s beliefs, just as I\u2019m sure she wants her beliefs to be respected. While I am absolutely fine with someone having a religion they believe in, I am not okay with someone attempting to convert me.\n\nWe have one nun in a family of \u2018heathens\u2019. She visits once a year or so, and is honestly a riot. Because most of the family was raised in a catholic household (mom and her siblings are in their 60\u2019s-70\u2019s), they are able to carry on a conversation about religion, but the nun never forces anything.\n\nThe last family dinner we had with her was right after two family members died tragically. The only surviving family member from that part of the family was staying with my parents for a while after losing his wife and only son. When we sat down for dinner, she asked the table if it was okay for her to say a prayer before eating. Although none of us are religious, we know it would provide her comfort, as my mom\u2019s youngest sister (who died) and her were very close.\n\nEven my step-father, who absolutely loathes organized religious, bowed his head for prayer. She knew none of us were religious, so she asked out of respect for the group. And we showed her that same respect in return.\n\nWhat your niece did was demand it from others, because that\u2019s how what her upbringing told her to do. This is a lesson that should be learned, unless she wants to alienate everyone she meets who doesn\u2019t share her beliefs.\n\n\u201cI know religion is very important to you And your family. But not everyone shares those beliefs, and that\u2019s okay. The world is filled with all sorts of people who believe in different things. If you want to pray, you go ahead.

Mom needs to address the everyone has to prayer before eating - everyone has to do as she believes.  I come from a family where we have all kinds of different religions/views.  I have personally told a cousin that myself - though my aunt was good with it and told her daughter I was right, different religions/beliefs and not everyone is going to do/believe as everyone else.\n\nWhat does she think is going to happen when her child is out in public and tries that?  A lot of people are pretty easy going about it but will not comply and some are very rude about it.  It is best she learns with family than out in public where it could get pretty heated these days.", "NTA- it\u2019s the truth. And it\u2019s important to realize that there are many belief systems and they are deserving of respect. \n\nThis is close to me right now because my kid\u2019s school friend has been told by her mother than she isn\u2019t allowed to be friends with him any more because we\u2019re an atheist family.

Nobody should try to impose their beliefs on others regardless of if they believe in God or not.\n\nYou weren't trying to change her views on if there is a God or not but just pointed out that other people have different views.

In return she needs to respect yours as well.", "NTA, you told the truth and didn't make a mockery of whatever religion her mother has her believing.", "[removed]", "NTA - Pierce the veil of indoctrination as soon as you can.

A cursory glance through the many different gospels that were excluded from the bible as we know it tells us that there was a whole lot of cherry picking going on when the religion was codified, partially at the bequest of a Roman emperor who wanted to use the church as a power base. **second edit** let that point sink in, _the bible as we know it was codified partially at the bequest of a Roman emperor who wanted to use the nascent christian church as a power base in the years after he seized power during a civil war._ \n\nSimilarly, a cursory glance through the old testament reveals a lot of really disgusting stuff. When my daughter was born, it wasn't the verses in the new testament about women being silent and deferring to their husbands that went through my mind, but the old testament verses telling the Israelite soldiers to massacre other people _down to their livestock_ but to keep the young girls for themselves. Not a lot of thinking needs to go into why the young girls were more valuable than the livestock, imo. **edit** Don't forget that Jesus, per his own words in the bible, came to fulfill the law of Moses, not to cast it aside, so those who say that Jesus' teachings of peace and love trump Moses, think again, but I am not a theologian.\n\nThe point of my comment here is that _there is no real reason to be respectful to religious people._ We don't need to defer ourselves so they can talk to their imaginary gods etc. It may be rude of us to do so, because most of us were raised in the context of the church's influence on the western world, but... why? If, before a chicken dinner, someone wanted to recite a short liturgy regarding why birds aren't real, we'd laugh them out of the house. Why should our treatment of any other religion be different?

This wasn't a bad idea at the time being the population reduction meant it would be difficult to get crops grown/harvested and jobs filled and would cause a further collapse of their world.

They needed something that would be a useful tool for claiming the high ground but couldn't be used against them. Abortion.

They have their own beliefs but keep them to themselves and we were free to choose what we wanted.\n\nI grew up atheist because I just wasn't exposed to it. Other people would tell me about going to church and their sunday school and their events like communion or other things and I was perfectly happy to not be a part of any of that, I didn't want to be - it sounded like extra work for no reason lol.\n\nMy sister is an amazing person and I like to think that I turned out alright, despite the lack of religion. We are still pretty big on values, and my father used to read is bedtime stories that dealt with virtues and stuff and just being a human being you get a lot of exposure to what it means to be a good person vs what it means to be a bad person and you don't need religion to learn or practice any of that", "Yeah, those are the kinds of people you leave behind.", "FWIW I'd be open to my 9-year-old interpretation of a Jubilee year, where all debts are forgiven every 50(?) years or so.

I mean... I have so many questions. How do goyim have bar mitzvahs? I feel like it's strange they didn't just go for actual conversion. It's not impossible to become a Jew, it just takes work.

If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\" \n\nIn other words, if you injure a pregnant woman and cause her to miscarry, you just pay a fine, but if you cause harm to the woman then the penalty is capital punishment. This implies that the unborn fetus isn't really considered a human on the same level as the mother.", "Yep- I'm not sure on when that certain point is, but even then the argument could be made that *pikuach nefesh* (saving a life) means that the life of the pregnant person is the most important thing. Saving a life is an obligation, even if the actions required to do so would violate other aspects of Jewish law. \n\nWhich, random side note, is why it annoys me so much when in like, medical shows you see the stereotype of the Orthodox Jew refusing treatment and being like \"Oh, Gd will take care of it\" because that's usually not how that effing goes!", "Oh definitely Jesus nuts. They are Christians who just piece together hodgepodge from Christianity and Judaism. I seriously think they are making it up as they go and the church they belong to is a scam.

I dont encounter them very often, but it happens (usually in the more conservative orthodox crowds). Luckily, none in my family.", "I believe they\u2019ve since canceled limbo for infants. Recent doctrines have taken the position that the intention of the mother to have the infant baptized counts, and that it\u2019s entirely possible G-d chooses to extend salvation to them. \n\nWhich I think is a good stance for the church, because it\u2019s hard to sell the idea of a loving god when said god keeps innocent babies out of paradise because the adults in their life couldn\u2019t move fast enough. I always thought Limbo was a stupid idea, because \u201che makes the rules, so can\u2019t G-d just decide who gets into heaven anyway?\u201d (My very Catholic grandmother was horrified by my disregard for doctrine, but my dad thought it was funny.)", "We are the machines, to them.", "I know it\u2019s funny because putting this all down in one place makes me realize even more so how wild it all is.

OP didn't disprove it, or tell her she believes in the wrong things.  The niece claimed they all needed to pray, OP corrected her in a perfectly respectful way.

Both of those religions have a lot of bullshit in their early history that, from the perspective of an outside viewer that doesn't have whatever faith is necessary to believe, looks a lot like arbitrary made up bullshit that the religion's founders used to achieve their very terrestrial aims. \n\nLike you can believe that Moroni like revealed the golden plates to Joseph Smith and that's cool. But isn't it the _least_ bit suspicious that when he translated them, Smith didn't even do so by actually looking at the plates? What about the other dudes who claimed to see them too? And then they just went back to Moroni? OK, let's just have some faith there, obviously Smith didn't just make them up. But in a broader context, just like during the time in which christianity evolved, there was a lot of religious action and pot stirring in the USA at that time and this wasn't the only like revealed mystery religion that popped out in that era, just one of the ones that survived in any real numbers - kind of like christianity.\n\nThis is just one of many issues, and it's just too much bs for me.", "I say religious because I mean religious.
