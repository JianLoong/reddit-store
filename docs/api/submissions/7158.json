Early this week, I received a message from M\u2019s teacher asking me to pick her up because she wasn\u2019t feeling well. I left work to get her from school. \n\nSome background information: M is speech delayed. She\u2019s been in speech therapy for almost 2 years now, and her speech has improved drastically since starting school. 6 months ago, she still wasn\u2019t speaking in complete sentences but she could communicate needs/wants etc. Now, she is nearly caught up with her peers and speaks age appropriately for the most part, but is still receiving therapy. \n\nMy aunt A (40sF) is my babysitter. She watches R while M is in school, and gets M off the bus in the afternoons. She watches them 3 days a week. A also takes care of her 2 grandkids and watches one of my sisters kids occasionally. I\u2019m the only one who pays her to babysit. \n\nWhen I picked M up from school, I was putting her in the car and she asked \u201cwhere\u2019s sissy?\u201d I told her she was at A\u2019s house and she asked \u201csissy sleeping?\u201d I told her I wasn\u2019t sure. M then says \u201cA says HATES sissy when she don\u2019t sleep.\u201d and I asked her to repeat that, and she did. So I asked, \u201cA says she hates sissy?\u201d and she says yes. Then i asked \u201cdoes she say she hates you too?\u201d She says yes. So I asked if she says she hates Z (grandson 2M) too and she says no. I ask her if A is mean to them, and she says yes. \n\nSo I went and picked up R from A\u2019s house. I didn\u2019t say anything about it when I picked her up. I honestly wasn\u2019t sure what to say at that point, all I knew was that I needed to pick my baby up and figure out the rest later. \n\nM always hates being dropped off there, and I just figured it was because all the kids there drive her crazy, and she wanted to stay with me. She\u2019s never said anything before that would make me think they were being mistreated, but she also didn\u2019t have good communication skills up until a few months ago. She would cry when I would tell her A was going to put her on the bus, but was fine when I put her on the bus. Again, I just assumed it was because she wanted me instead. There\u2019s other things too, but I\u2019ll admit that I just chalked it up to her wanting to stay with me.\n\nYesterday, I sent A a message. I told her I would find someone else to watch my kids. I didn\u2019t accuse her, or try to start a argument. I simply told her her why I didn\u2019t want her to babysit anymore. She denied it. She wasn\u2019t sure why she would say something like that, she loves my kids as if they were her own. She said, \u201cShe probably said that because she thinks if i don\u2019t watch her, her dad will.\u201d I know my kid, and she isn\u2019t able to be manipulative like that yet. She rarely \u2018tells stories\u2019 and if she does, it\u2019s something along the lines of sonic dumped her toys on the floor, not her. Then it was, maybe she heard her say that to the dog. \n\nSo, AITA for believing my 4 year old and not the babysitter?", "created_utc": 1673538911, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10a2y5r/aita_for_believing_my_4_year_old/", "score": 602, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As for her saying that A \u201chates her and R\u201d, I can\u2019t help but wonder if she did overhear A on a bad day.

But i know sometimes she doesn\u2019t want to go back to sleep when she wakes up early so it made me think that even when she don\u2019t want to go back to sleep in the mornings, she tries to make her, and maybe she got aggravated that she wouldn\u2019t sleep and she said that. \nSomething else I wasn\u2019t able to add into the post due to character count was when i went to pick her up, she was in a room with the door closed, in the pack and play asleep. A was in the other room, with her 2 grandchildren, with the door closed, also asleep. at 1:30pm. A would always tell me how good of a sleeper R is, and that she always goes back to sleep in the morning. But why is my baby in the other room, while she\u2019s in a separate room with the other 2 kids, with 2 closed doors between them? It just made me think, that she would put her in there regardless if she wanted to sleep or not, so she wouldn\u2019t cry and bother the other to kids who were sleeping. That might just be me reaching. But after thinking about the situation, it made sense to me.", "Same here, totally just fucked up my day and now I'm going to go hug my kids a little extra.", "Yeah that seems like a red flag and it does back up what 4 said. But it could also mean youngest doesn\u2019t sleep well when other people are in the room? IDK but I don\u2019t feel like this is something you ignore. At least with a nanny you could tell them up front you will have a nanny cam. \n\n4 could have meant that Aunt complains when sister doesn\u2019t sleep, not that she tells the baby she hates her, but either way it stuck with your 4 year old, so it\u2019s not a good thing IMO.", "NAH  \nI think this is a scenario of better safe than sorry. Sometimes kids just say random stuff. Or they don't report stuff accurately. It's very possible your kid overheard A on the phone complaining that she hates it when M doesn't sleep, or venting her frustration on a particularly bad day or something similar. Maybe she even told them directly \"I hate it when you don't sleep\" which is different than telling a kid \"I hate you\" (though I still wouldn't word it that way). \n\nBut in a situation where the kids are too young or unable to properly and reliably articulate what's happening to them, it's better to remove them from potentially bad situations.", "NTA.

They are the ones most likely to cause harm.", "NTA maybe kids just don't like to be told but kids are often over looked for what they do pick up on.  IF kids are right it's better to get a new baby sitter.  Either way it's simply a baby sitter.  It's not a big thing to worry about.", "NTA red flags from the start, but especially \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 when A changes the story from \"your child is lying to manipulate you\" to \"your child misunderstood me\" as soon as it became clear you'd defend M from being accused of outright malicious behaviour", "NTA\n\nAt the end of the day, if your child has misunderstood, exaggerated or (highly unlikely for a 4 year old) lied, the worst case scenario is that you have had find a new baby sitter. If you stick with your Aunt and your child was right, the worst case scenario is a lot worse than that.\n\nIf you feel the need (if you are trying to maintain a relationship) just let your Aunt know that while you understand that there could be some other things going on, you certainly don't want to make your young child believe that you are not willing to listen to her, so while you aren't trying to hurt her, you will be finding a new babysitter.", "NTA\n\nAnd THANK YOU for listening to your child. So many parents don't and its utterly disgusting and cruel. \n\nKids this age have active imaginations but there's certain things they do not say unless they've learned it from somewhere. So many people believe toddlers are capable of manipulating but they aren't. they are not capable of it. Decades of studies and research has proven this. They cannot manipulate. In order to manipulate someone has to have a specific goal and outcome in mind for personal gain. Toddlers aren't capable of that thinking. The only thing they are capable of is doing things for basic core survival such as getting love, affection, food, water, etc. They have no other agenda nor capabilities for manipulation or agendas. \n\nYou 100 percent did the right thing. You're a good momma, thank you for protecting your babies, especially when so many pathetic, loser worthless parents do not. They're lucky to have a mom who listens to them and believes them. You're setting them up for a wonderful foundation that will show and teach them that they can fully rely on and trust you. Good job <3", "We always tell our kids to tell us if anybody does anything to them that they are uncomfortable with. This helps our kids to trust us enough if they face abuse. We need to believe them when they do. At worst, she is uncomfortable there and that should be enough to change babysitter. NTA", "NTA.  Listen to your kid.  You're doing nothing wrong.  It's not like you're going nuclear on Auntie without investigating further.  You're not pressing charges or anything, you're just taking your kids out of what sounds like a bad situation.", "NTA. It\u2019s one of those unfortunate moments but think of your child first.. if your child is unhappy..", "NTA - please listen to your child.\n\nMy brother and I are 5 yrs apart so he started kindergarten just as I was born. My mother hired a babysitter for me when I was 2 months old. My brother in 5 yr old language tried to tell them that I was in danger. My parents ignored this until one day about 2 or 3 months later I was covered in bruises head to toe when my mother picked me up. Apparently I didn't want to eat that day.\n\nIt's a very short step from someone saying they don't like or hate a child to them injuring that child.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n\nBut how cute/upsetting that M was hopeful R was sleeping so A wouldn\u2019t be mean to her.

While covered in chocolate... with the container under their bed", "Yeah, agree with this, I remember lots of lies and secrets from when I was four/fiveish and I had speech issues too. It wasn't malicious, just mischievous, or not wanting parents to get in the way of me doing what I wanted. \n\nOP is NTA at all for erring on the side of caution and finding alternative childcare arrangements, because the stakes are high with abuse. But, that doesn't mean it is impossible the kid was lying, especially since after the initial statement, the kid was just answering 'yes' to leading questions.", "Oh geez, I just read thru that thread.  I'm glad I don't have kids", "Does she have a receptive language delay as well? That would make a misunderstanding more likely - telling \"I hate when you do X\" and \"I hate you\" apart can be difficult for some children.

He's 4.5. He has a good vocabulary and articulation, but he doesn't do supporting words like prepositions or pronouns, so his sentence structure was weird and took some coaching.\n\nThat could also be another reason to take what the daughter says with a very large grain of salt. My son will latch on a word and then use it when it's not the right word. Like saying he's scared of a particular food when he just doesn't like it.", "NTA. We need more moms like you. That\u2019s why all these people fucked up cause their moms didn\u2019t listen to them or take their side.", "NTA.\n\nIt's always best to err on the side of believing your children.", "NTA. You are a great parent. You listened to your daughter! You are helping her, and she'll never forget that. Yeah, she's young - but it was a moment that cements your relationship with your daughter. I think of it like this:\n\n- When you're child is little, you need to think about what relationship you want with your child when they're a teenager.\n- When they're a teenager, you need to think about what relationship you want with them as an adult.\n\nYou listened to your kid, and she's gonna go to you when she needs to again. She has your confidence.\n\nI'll take myself as an example. I'm 17, and I had an 'accident in bed'. It was mortifying for me, but due to my luck I wasn't surprised. Shit happens. My Mum was at the doctors, I messaged her and said 'call me when you've finished.' By the time she rang me I put my sheets, clothes and doona in the wash and I explained what happened. She didn't laugh, joke or anything. We're a sarcastic bunch, but we know when it's time to be serious. \n\nShe asked me what I had done since, and I told her I cleaned it all up. She was proud that I did that, and she'd see me soon.\n\nIt was a good outcome and reinforced that I can talk to my parents whenever I need.\n\nThe same goes for this instance and your kids.", "YTA\n\nSlow down and talk to the adult before you make a decision. You acted hastly and as if she was guilty. You clearly trusted her to watch M, trust her enough to have a conversation.", "NAH\n\nKids tend to be pretty suggestible and if they\u2019re asked a direct question they tend to just agree with the adult or pick one of the options presented to them. Best way is to use more open questions that allow the kid to share their story themselves, because when that\u2019s used their information can be very reliable. Sometimes they can lie too, they\u2019re kids. \n\nYou\u2019re doing what you think is best for your child, and if you think you need to take this step to protect your child, you should do it. But she also could\u2019ve misunderstood the situation.", "NTA. She has also been telling you non-verbally she doesn\u2019t like it there, which matches what she can now tell you. Our two year olds hated one daycare, and would cry at drop-off every day. Then I saw and heard some things that made me unhappy with the dc, and I switched to another one. They were happy as clams to go to the 2nd daycare. So even though they couldn\u2019t verbalize a problem, it was clear there was one. Same with your daughter. Good for you for listening to her.", "This hits home for me. When I was a child all the way until I was in 5th grade I was in a daycare. The lady who ran the daycare did some pretty horrifically abusive things and almost exclusively towards me. The other kids saw that they could get away with mistreating me at daycare and so they bullied me horrifically and even physically assaulted me to the point that one girl knocked out one of my baby teeth bashing me in the face repeatedly with a toy and no one did a damn thing. My parents didn't believe me when I said Carolyn hurts me because Caorlyn was the adult and according to her I was just clumsy. I am so scarred from what happened to me at that daycare that I could never stand to put my own kid in daycare. And that's after years of therapy. It was really bad. I have ARFID from being held down by that woman and physically force fed, with her repeatedly striking me in the face until I swallowed the food she shoved (literally) into my mouth. If I try to force myself to eat now when Im not hungry but need food for diabetes I start vomiting uncontrollably. We weren't allowed to eat lunch at daycare until we all told Carolyn how much we loved her. Just thinking of what I went through disgusts me and no one did a damn thing until I was in 5th grade and when somethingWAS done it was only done because several other parents got involved saying I was attacking their kids and threatening to murder them (which was a huge lie). The things that happened at that daycare to me have scarred me for the rest of my life in ways that therapy may not be able to help. Being heavily abused from a young age leaves permanent marks on psyche of the child in question \n\nBelieve your child.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe thing is, this isn\u2019t a one-time moment. Once you thought about it you noticed a pattern of behaviour where your kid did NOT want to be near her aunt. \n\nThis gives your daughters words more credibility. For whatever reason - your kid is NOT happy spending time with A.  If you have other avenues for childcare - use them. \n\nI might not have told A what your kid has been telling you since the truth isn\u2019t very clear. If it\u2019s completely true then it gives A time to form convincing lies and if it isn\u2019t true then it would make her feel affronted and defensive as it\u2019s a pretty big accusation. Neither option is going to yield anything useful, so I personally would have avoided telling A what your kid said and just found other childcare - keeping A as a reserve back up and just bidding my time to see if I could learn more. \n\nHindsight\u2019s always 20/20 though. \n\nRegardless - you\u2019re making the right call finding other care.

I assumed it was change of routine combined with wanting to stay with me( he dropped her off 90% since he started work later). Once she was old enough, she said that the one teacher was mean unless parents were there. I pulled her out immediately. My stomach sank and it just felt true. Trust your gut", "Preschoolers definitely lie. And they lie about stuff they know will cause a reaction. That said, it's more the nearly 5/5s stage of development and it sounds like OPs daughter isn't quite there yet. And this is too coherent for a preschoolers lie. Based on my nearly 5 it's pretty obvious when they are lying and when they are telling the truth. It's not malicious, it's a stage of development.", "Right. Listen to kids of course, but at that age their understanding of truth is much more nebulous than the average adults. Kids want to please us so it is absolutely a challenge allowing them to tell the truth without being prompted by accident. It's a learned skill.", "Yup, I ended mistrusting adults/authority figures growing up because no one would believed me/my classmates in regards to a teacher we had in 1st grade. She was older, close to retirement, and would love screaming in our faces about how she \"used to be able to hit kids like us\" at the start of her career.
