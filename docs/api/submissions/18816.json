The basement has an unfinished side that includes a boiler room, a large pantry/store room, a workshop, and a laundry room. There is also a finished side that has a gym, a small theater room, and a small apartment for guests (1 bedroom, living area, bathroom, no kitchen). The property is nearly 10 acres and has a 2 car garage, another workshop, a shed, and a large gated garden that is protected from critters & includes many cold frames for winter growing.\n\nMy relative lived in the larger of the two homes for more than 5 years while I lived in the small house. After my relative passed away, I moved into the larger house. The property is completely in my name, and I own it outright. \n\nAbout a year ago, I decided to rent out the smaller house to cover property taxes and a few other expenses. I am friendly with my lodger, but we aren\u2019t friends. Her rental agreement states she has access to her house, 1 spot in the garage, the shared sunroom, and the laundry room (along with a few other rules about limits on the number of guests she has, the limit of overnight visits, etc.). The other rooms in the basement (e.g. storage rooms, gym, workshop, etc.), aren\u2019t included and she doesn\u2019t not have access them.\n\nI do a lot of gardening and produce enough fruit & veggies to feed me and 2 families that I deliver the food to for free. Shortly after moving in, my lodger started grumbling about gardening, so I offered to let her clear another spot on the property to start her own garden. That became a whole thing because she wanted to use my garden because of the raised beds, fencing, etc. She started her own separate garden, but I think she\u2019s still salty about this.\n\nSince then she has discovered a locked off stairway from her house into the locked off part of the basement (this staircase isn\u2019t included in the agreement as part of her house that she is entitled to use), and she has discovered that the basement has a gym and a theater room. She has been making it known that she wants access to those areas and is annoyed with me that I won\u2019t give her access. \n\nIt\u2019s tense between us now, and I\u2019m pretty much set that I won\u2019t be renewing her rental agreement in a few months. Most of my friends agree that it\u2019s fair I stick to the rental agreement and not budge on giving her access to other parts of the basement, but a few of them think I\u2019m being an AH. And all my friends think it\u2019s likely that any other lodgers will be annoyed if they don\u2019t get to use the gym or theater or even extra storage space.

You modified it to allow access to the garden to grow vegetables. Bottom line, you have been accommodating.  \n\nBut she keeps pushing your boundaries. I would not recommend renewing her lease, she will continue to want more & more access to your area/home. \n\nYour home sounds lovely, you will easily replace her & her constant demands.", "NTA. It's your property, you can rent out what you like. Just make it clear that renters don't have access to certain areas.\n\nAnd hold firm with your tenant; she sounds problematic w/her complaints. Make sure you give her plenty of advance notice you won't be renewing her lease.", "NTA. It's very weird that your friends think any future lodgers would also be upset about this. If you marketed the rental property with photos of the gym or theater, then said sorry, those are off limits once someone moved in, that would be upsetting. But as long as the agreement is clear, there should be no problem.\n\nI used to live in an upstairs-downstairs duplex. My apartment included the front porch and the downstairs one had a nicer bathroom. None of us complained about not getting to use the other amenities just because there was an (always locked) indoor stairwell connecting the two apartments!", "NTA\n\nThe agreement is signed - she knew what she had access to. I think of it as though the houses were separate, in this instance, she is essentially saying she's entitled to access your house too. It just so happens there is a locked door connecting the two.", "NTA, is she offering to pay more for access to these amenities?", "NTA (my general thoughts on landlords notwithstanding (\u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ). Look at it this way, you have two houses and a tunnel connects them. Your home is the house and the tunnel. The second house is rented out. Her lease entitles her to the house. Not to your tunnel. Frankly it'd be no different than if she was demanding to sit in your living room and watch your TV. She's asking to have access to part of *your* home as part of her rental agreement. that was never part of the deal.\n\nEspecially since it sounds like she didn't even know that gym and theater existed when she signed the lease. It's not like she thought she was getting those in the lease and was mistaken or mislead by you.", "NTA. There's no reason to give her access to areas she's not renting, and dame goes with the future tenants. When you rent out one bedroom house and make it clear what includes to it, no one has a right to be salty that your living area includes gym and movie theatre. They're not renting that.", "NTA. Tell  her you may reconsider her having access to the gym and theatre but if you do it will increase the rent by (insert the percentage of increase of the living space).  See how she responds.", "NTA.  She is paying rent only for the areas you specified in the agreement.  If she had access to all the other areas her rent would be much more than she is paying, no doubt.\n\nIt doesnt matter if she is salty.  She is the one bringing all the salt.  \n\nShe seems very entitled& unpleasant as well as being ungrateful.  You didnt have to allow her a space to garden but you did.  Rather than be grateful and focusing on her area, she wanted more. Then she wanted to use your raised beds.  If you were to allow her access to the other areas, she no doubt, would feel entitled and start monopolizing the areas  and making demands that you& your guests can come back another day because she had already decided.to.use, or other such malarkey.  It would just be a nightmare to manage it, at least with this specific entitled tenant.\n\nWhen her lease runs out and you lease it to someone else, you might add something to the contract that there are other adjoining rooms that are not included in the lease, and those are your personal areas to which tenants do not have access.  That way if someone discovers the rooms and they ask for access you can point to the place in the contract where they signed that they agreed they did not have access to those rooms", "CLEAR NTA", "INFO: the stairwell is locked so how did she even find out about the other rooms unless she either jimmied the lock or went around outside peering in basement windows?", "NTA. I think it's similar to Planet Fitness. Everyone pays a membership fee, but people who pay extra get to use things like the tanning booth. Landlords who provide things like a gym on the property also charge a higher rent. So, if your tenant wanted access to that extra stuff, you could charge a higher rent. But you have the right to prevent her from using the extras since they're not part of her lease; therefore, she's wrong to expect to use them for free.", "NTA.  You went above and beyond to clear a space for her garden.  Your home, your rules, and you are perfectly entitled to reserve some of that basement space for your own private use.", "NTA she isn't renting that space she has no right to use it.", "INFO: What do you mean she's \"making it known\" that she wants access and is annoyed? Is this something she brings up over and over?\n\nI think your friends are right that lots of people would be a bit put out to find that there's a gym in the house but they can't use it. That doesn't mean you have to allow it, of course. You can't expect her not to be annoyed, but if she's asked outright and you said no, then she should drop it and not bring it up again.", "NTA. If you\u2019re rental agreement is absolutely clear on those things, it\u2019s none of her business. You let her dig up some of your yard for her garden.
