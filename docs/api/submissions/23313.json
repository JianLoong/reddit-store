(strangers and aquaintances anyway, I do care about the opinions of the people I care about, up to a point). \nThis obviously caused a lot of friction as we went to the same primary schools (schools coz we moved around a lot) When the time came for her to go to HS she chose to go to mine (in my country you pick your HS based on the type you want to go to, and there's multiples of the same type, so it's not location based). \nI told her that (a) she'd get all the worst teachers (because she would, teachers are assigned to years, with several teaching the same subject, so I knew who she was getting) and (b) that I wasn't interested in \"toning myself down\"  and wouldn't be doing it just because she chose to attend my HS (I was a heavily goth kid in HS. Less heavy now in my 30s but still \"weird\" by most people's standards, also openly bisexual and loud, opinionated, etc, which at the time was very much \"weird\" ).\nHonestly the 2 years without her were the freest and least drama filled  I'd had in years and I didn't want to have to deal with that anymore, either. \n\nWellp, she took it as a challenge, and went to my school. Then tried to make it all about her. She ended up giving herself an ulcer by the 2nd grade of HS (due to the bad teachers, she's a perfectionist) and had to switch schools at the time. Which didn't mean much for me, since that was already in my senior year (2 years apart academically). Of course my outfits, behaviour etc was a constant source of anger and unhappiness for her as well and she couldn't understand why I didn't care about being normal or fitting in. I didn't understand (and still don't) why she cares about any of that. It's literally irrelevant to me and I can't imagine changing who I am because of society's weird and often conflicting expectations. \n\nThe thing is, you can ask her to change, and she can say no. That's her right.  You wanting a seperate identity and not to be affected by hers *is* very much understandable as well, especially with the shit you're getting in your inbox. \n\nLock up your social media. Set it so only friends of friends can send you messages or try to add you. That'll cutt down on a lot of BS. \nThe best thing I can reccomend is looking visibly different from her, or attending a different college. That way, her reputation won't have anything to do with yours, and you can grow in whichever direction you want without it affecting her or her affecting you. Good luck.

Then what?", "> If you catch yourself saying something like, \u201cWell, I shouldn\u2019t have to change \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ just because she \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_,\u201d just realize that you\u2019re experiencing what she feels when you demand for her to change her lifestyle.\n\nSurely there is an easily understood contextual difference between changing your hair and making it clear to your beaus not to sexually harass your sister.", ">You can\u2019t control her, but you can control your hairstyle.\n\nThis is basically the equivalent of \"if you want to stay safe, put more clothes on\".  \n\n\nShe having to change herself to stay safe from pervs because her sister knows how to spread legs, but not explain people that her twin is not her....... c'mon........", "She shouldn't have to go into the witness protection program because of her sisters behavior. Sister should at least try to meet her halfway here.", "I mean, of all the people apart from her sister, OP probably has the biggest right/valid reason to judge. Her sister's decisions are affecting her. \n\nIt would be different if someone who was unimpacted was judging but is it right to chastise OP for judging the situation when she herself is bearing the consequences?\n\nI think OP realises her name calling was AHish but I'm not going to say she is wrong for coming to a conclusion on the situation and asking the sister to make sure her actions don't impact OP. \n\nI do think its time to end the roommate thing though", "I\u2019m convinced that a significant percentage of sub have no idea what NAH or ESH mean, especially NAH.", "Well she admitted that the name-calling was an AH move. She was asking if the request made her one. And honestly, I can sympathize. Getting those nudes because of her twin would suck.\n\nHonestly the best thing would be for one of them to do something to look different. Dyed hair or something. Even getting different places would still cause the DM issues. And maybe OP can start going by her middle name, at least on social media. Similar names and similar looks, it makes sense that they are confused for each other.", "idk, I'm a Kathleen and I get confused for Katherine, Kaitlin, ect a lot.", "Yes, there is:\n\nOne is in OP's control.\n\nThe other is not in OP's control.\n\nI completely agree with you that OP's sister \\*should\\* help by making it clear that her sister exists and shouldn't be harassed, but if she doesn't, then OP has options.\n\nWhen I say ESH, I'm not saying OP is an AH because she wants her sister to help. She's an AH because she's openly disgusted by her sister's sexual choices. The only request she should make is for some help regarding identity. The fact that she even lists her sister changing her sexual habits as a part of this is because she wants her sister to do that, anyway. \n\nShe was the one who started saying her sister should change, and then she complains when her sister suggests she could use \"some d\\*cking\". I highly doubt her sister would have said that if OP weren't suggesting that she lower her d\\*ck count.", "1. You and OP can focus on the safety issue, but it's clear that both of you are also seriously judging the sister's sexuality. Her sister can get all the d\\*cking she wants, and she doesn't deserve any judgment for that. It's ironic that OP is effectively telling her sister to tone down her sexuality, and you use the \"put more clothes on\" example to defend OP. \n2. I updated to ESH because you're right, her sister should at least tell people to leave OP alone because they're not the same person.\n3. OP's sister is not cooperating. In a purely practical sense, if safety is actually a concern, it may be necessary for OP to do things that are within her control to be safe. To the degree that OP doesn't even consider such options, it makes me wonder if it's more about being grossed out than actually being in harm's way.\n\nI can see people mistaking her for her sister in person, but unless her sister is giving people the wrong name, how are they finding OP's social media and not her sister's?\n\nShe could start her profiles with \"If you're looking for my twin sister <sister's name>, here's her profile...\"\n\nSure, in principle she shouldn't have to do this, but the reality is that her sister isn't helping, and there are steps she can take.", "Except she didn't offer to go half way either.", "But if it really bothers OP she can cut or dye her hair so they look less alike, dress differently, go by a nickname or a number of other options to distance herself from her sister without forcing her sister to change behavior. \n\nNow, the loud sex at all hours is a matter of common courtesy that should be discussed between any pair of roommates. But beyond keeping it to certain hours, going to the other person\u2019s apartment, or just trying to be a bit quieter, the sister should not feel the need to modify her behavior unless she wants to.", "You know there is more to any story when it starts with \"I don't judge.... but\"", "I acknowledged the actual situation as an ESH and know she admitted s!ut was a dick move BUT am calling out the outright misrepresentation of her own personality. Nobody who believes they have no right to judge others throws that word at another person, let alone a loved one.", "Hey Katrina!", "The confusion on social media probably is the extremely similar name. If the picture fits and the name is somewhat close i would assume its them too, and here the picture isnt close but absolutely identical.", "Exactly my point too :) I agree", "I don't know how apt this analogy is but could it be similar to the negative externalities of smoking?\n\nThe sister's actions could be compared to the second hand smoke effect that smokers have on their surroundings. OP (someone who isn't involved) is being negatively impacted. \n\nI would feel that if I was subject to bad amounts of second hand smoke, I would have the right to judge the smoker. I shouldn't have to wear a particulate mask or hold my breath to avoid breathing in the smoke. And I think that in that vein, it shouldn't be on OP to change their style. It should be on sister to inform her partners that she has a twin and that she is not to be contacted.", "I mean it was in retaliation to being called a prude. Kind of a fuck around and find out moment for op's sister", "It's true that parents do sometimes give twins similar names.\n\nEven so, you'd think they'd find the right one first instead of the wrong one. Maybe OP's sister is more creative with her social media names. If that's the case, that's yet another potential way she could help, if she chose to.", "I look nothing like my twin sister and we've got very dissimilar names. We still got confused for each other. That might be because we have similar mannerisms or because some people just allocate one shot in their brain for twins instead of two.\n\nI can't imagine how much OP has gotten mistaken for her sister with a similar name and identical looks. \n\nRegardless of that, she does not get to dictate her sister's behaviour. She is only in control of herself, not anyone else."]}
