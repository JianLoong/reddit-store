Less heavy now in my 30s but still \"weird\" by most people's standards, also openly bisexual and loud, opinionated, etc, which at the time was very much \"weird\" ).\nHonestly the 2 years without her were the freest and least drama filled  I'd had in years and I didn't want to have to deal with that anymore, either. \n\nWellp, she took it as a challenge, and went to my school. Then tried to make it all about her. She ended up giving herself an ulcer by the 2nd grade of HS (due to the bad teachers, she's a perfectionist) and had to switch schools at the time. Which didn't mean much for me, since that was already in my senior year (2 years apart academically). Of course my outfits, behaviour etc was a constant source of anger and unhappiness for her as well and she couldn't understand why I didn't care about being normal or fitting in. I didn't understand (and still don't) why she cares about any of that. It's literally irrelevant to me and I can't imagine changing who I am because of society's weird and often conflicting expectations. \n\nThe thing is, you can ask her to change, and she can say no. That's her right.  You wanting a seperate identity and not to be affected by hers *is* very much understandable as well, especially with the shit you're getting in your inbox. \n\nLock up your social media. Set it so only friends of friends can send you messages or try to add you. That'll cutt down on a lot of BS. \nThe best thing I can reccomend is looking visibly different from her, or attending a different college.

I felt misunderstood and used a lot, just because we looked a bit alike, although she was older, had a totally different name and even lived a town away. \n\nOP and her twin look alike, share the same contacts and same last name.

OP, I\u2019m an identical twin who also looks like her sister and has been mistaken for her. From how the post was written, it sounds like sister\u2019s partners are reaching out to OP because they think she\u2019s her sister, not because they\u2019re intentionally hitting on her (I apologize if I\u2019m misunderstanding and I\u2019m not at ALL saying that that reduces how terrible this experience is for OP). I say this because the reason this seems to be happening is because you look the same. As others have suggested, a change of physical appearance may need to be made (it\u2019s absolutely unfair for both parties but kind of a disadvantage of being a twin that neither party can control). I think it might be helpful also for OP to seek out her own friend circle. She says she has no friends because people only reach out to her because they think she\u2019s her sister. OP, this is when you can construct YOUR identity. We\u2019re a similar age and I\u2019m also not interested in relationships, but this is where you can branch out to other people yourself. Can you join a club at school? Something so people get to know YOU. I started doing that and I found it immediately helped because a LOT of people didn\u2019t even know I had a twin since I never brought it up. Friends aren\u2019t always going to come to you (which was a really hard thing for me to learn as a twin), but seeking out people with my interests immediately made me more confident in my identity which is so hard as a twin.\n\nAs for the sex at all hours: you are also roommates, and it doesn\u2019t seem you have a roommate relationship. My twin and I established a separate roommate relationship (instead of just twin relationship) to ensure all duties of the house were met (we also shared an apartment). You need to work together to come to an agreement on responsibilities if that hasn\u2019t already been done.\n\nETA: I also think it\u2019s imperative OP\u2019s sister inform her partners that she does have a twin sister so to double check they\u2019re messaging the right person (or verify they have the right social media before getting together).

This kind of thing rarely works in the opposite direction. As in they think sleeping with twin sisters is fine but they likely would be offended at the idea of a woman being okay with sleeping with twin brothers. Unfortunately, I've asked this question before to former friends that got me the answer. Hence, former friends.\n\nWhile informing you that you have a twin is necessary, doing it by admitting you live together is a bad, bad idea. Sleep with the guy you want and you can say you have a twin but if they get excited over it and ask if you two live together do not answer in the positive. The answer should be along the lines of \"oh, she lives with a roommate\" because it's still technically true since you're the roommate but doesn't disclose where your twin lives. \n\nAlso, saying you have a roommate instead of specifically saying you live with your twin sister is better for your safety as well which OP's sister should consider doing because that means there's someone who'd call the authorities if things go south for them.

No matter how many times they correct people, there's always going to be people that don't believe her or don't care.", ">I mean, of all the people apart from her sister, OP probably has the biggest right/valid reason to judge. Her sister's decisions are affecting her.\n\nLoads of decisions affect other people, *including* decisions that have an amoral quality (ie: lacking moral value). If I'm a person in a wheelchair and my local busses only have one spot where they can strap a wheelchair safely in, and I get on the bus at one stop, and another person in a wheelchair wants to get in at the next stop, my decision to take the bus has negatively affected her. That doesn't mean I don't have a right to take the bus. Maybe I'm taking the bus to go to the bookstore to shop leisurely and they're trying to get on the bus to go to a job interview-- it doesn't matter who's destination has more \"value\", they can't demand I get off the bus so that they can ride it. Taking a disability spot on that bus (when you yourself are disabled) to go to the store is not a immoral thing just on the fact it negatively affected another disabled person. For the record, I'm not making a comparison between these two situations here, I'm trying to point out a different situation where you would unquestionably agree with me that someone who has inconvenienced someone else is not acting immorally.\n\nHer sister has the right to her own body. That means she has a right to sleep with other people with it as much as she wants, to chose her own appearance, to  live where she wants, to go by the name her parents gave her. She cannot control the fact they were born identical anymore than OP can. Even if it negatively affects OP, none of the actions affecting her have a moral value. Her sister is doing nothing wrong. It's unfortunate that her sister's actions have negatively affected OP, but that doesn't give OP the right to make demands about how her sister lives her life.\n\nYou can only work with your problems in ways that are under your control. The hypothetical wheelchair-user on their way to a job interview can't demand I get off the bus, but they can call a taxicab if they think they can't make it to the job interview on time if they wait for the next bus.\n\nOP can make her social media private and make a policy to seek out the people she wants to add and be closed for random followers/friend requests/ect (depending on the social media she's on). She can chose to put a different name on her social media to make her easier to distinguish from her sister. She can change her profile picture to an anime character so that when people do find her they don't think she's \"someone with a similar name who looks identical, Emma may be short for Emelia, so chances are this is probably Emma,\" but \"someone who goes to the school with a similar name to my hookup so she may or may not be my hookup.\" She can dye or cut her hair, do her makeup in some dramatic way. Not all of these are dramatic life changes, and a small selection of them would probably solve at least some of the issues she's having. But her sister's life isn't under her control, and neither of them is an asshole for happening to exist in the world as she is while looking identical to another person.\n\nEDIT: And while everyone in this comments sections is going on about how OP's sister could just explain the situation to her hookups, I want to point out that this is just putting the impossible expectation of \"trying to control other people's actions\" onto OP's sister. Yes, she can say that she has an identical twin who has a similar name to her to people. But some people will still act badly despite the warning, some people will act badly because of the warning (c'mon, how many asshole college guys are going to hear \"I have a twin sister\" said within the context of a hookup and not be distracted by porn fantasies and harass OP's sister anyways). And non-asshole people will probably be turned off from OP's sister for assuming they're going to be assholes to her sister right out of the gate. If we remove ourselves from reddit's fanficy version of the real world for a second and step into the actual real world, how do any of you think you'd react if at some point in a hookup your date said, \"Btw don't harass my sister?\" You'd be weirded out. And at the end of the day, OP's sister can't control what her hookups do anymore than OP can control what her sister does.", "Exactly. I don't remember the names of half the people I've slept with cause they're just that, a one night stand. They don't matter so why remember", "Her sister can try, but none of that is going to be as effective as OP making some way to distinguish her sister. Her sister can't control what other people do-- she can make a request, but a guy who's a random hookup isn't a predictable beast. She literally doesn't know the guy. He could respond with, \"Oooh twinsies,\" and harass OP on purpose KNOWING she's not her sister. He could forget the comment in his drunk and later hungover state. He could still look at OP's social media and still think \"I'm really sure this is the right twin\" and be wrong. Or he could be a decent guy and get upset by his hookup making the assumption he's going to be an asshole.

Even if she did, if the sister doesn\u2019t let it be known that she\u2019s a twin, they may assume her sister changed her hairstyle. If I was OP and it was impacting my life that much, I\u2019d just change schools and move out. It sucks, but it seems like the sister doesn\u2019t give a shit that her choices are impacting her twin.", "Sure, been saying that the whole time.", "Well if I was being sexually harassed because of actions my sibling was taking, you damn bet I would suggest them changing their lifestyle", "I think it says more about you than it does the people having a one night stand, that you assume they can't have respect for the other after having fucked. You aren't automatically a shitty person for liking casual sex, and it's really shitty you think it does.", "Well, give yourself a hand.", "It completely sucks for OP. But she can only control herself, not her sister. She shouldn\u2019t HAVE to take actions on her own to alleviate the situation, but at least that is within her control.", "Wow!  I hadn't even thought about the things you suggested in your first paragraph. Yikes!  I agree that transferring schools might be the safest option.", "Tell 'em as you shuffle 'em out the door.\n\n\"Hey, thanks for the dick. Btw I have an identical twin with a similar name, don't bother her.\"", "Yet people eat it up", "You would be surprised, people will manage to convince themselves it's a Clark Kent/Superman thing.  \nHell, when I started wearing glasses in high school, someone in the periphery of my social circle was utterly convinced I was a twin, because I didn't wear them all the time, so there was me with glasses, and me without."]}
