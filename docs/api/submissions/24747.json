She's doing great, making great progress.. but not getting promoted. For why?", "Her bosses were like Oprah. \"You get a promotion! And YOU get a promotion! You get a promotion, too!!\" Until, suddenly, \"Oh, but not you. Maybe next year or the year after.\"\n\nAnd you somehow think it's a total coincidence that everyone who got promoted has a penis, including the people with less experience than her?\n\nYTA. At the very least, you needed to be more empathetic.\n\nBeing caught by surprise when good things happen to everyone but you is a horrible experience. You basically just told her you think it's her own fault. I hope you're looking forward to being single.", "YTA.  The 'feedback' is she was doing great and making good progress?  Did they specifically say what she wasn't doing that would have got her the promotion?  You telling her to listen to their feedback is useless if they didn't give her anything to work with.\n\nConstructive feedback would help her see areas she needs to work on - your post does not tell us what they gave as a the reason for no promotion - if there wasn't one, and they didn't give her any advice on what she could do to secure the promotion next year, then there is a problem.\n\nINFO - the people who got promoted - were they all men?  Including the graduates?  It's not clear if she was singled out here - she thinks she was, so more info needed to know if this is what she thinks it is, or if she is leaving stuff out of what she is telling you. It isn't clear from your post if you asked her about these things - you just told her to suck it up.\n\nFor the record, a lot of women have 'imposter syndrome' - we are conditioned from birth to think ourselves inferior, and the world continually reminds us this is still the paradigm - imposter syndrome is a real thing.  It does not necessarily reflect on actual performance - I have had women working with me under estimate themselves in self assessments all the time.  Even when you tell them they are great they still don't totally believe it.", "YTA. From what you say here, you haven't even asked her WHY she suspects sexism. You automatically assumed it was something else. You're not really offering advice here, just brushing off her interpretations of events that she is involved in and that you are not. In your own way, you're reinforcing the sexist dynamic present here. \n\nAnd also YTA for completely misunderstanding imposter syndrome. Some of the best, most talented, most qualified, most experienced people feel like they're absolute failures. That's why it's 'imposter syndrome' and not 'I am actually very bad at my job syndrome.'", "YTA - it sounds like she really is being gaslit and singled out. The feedback is corporate bull crap. If she\u2019s doing well why not move her up? what kind of feedback did they give her? And no offence but many men just don\u2019t get it because many never experienced sexism like this but pretty much every woman I\u2019ve ever talked to has.. If she asked for your advice maybe but it sounds like she was hoping to hear you believed and supported her, not a lesson on how to be more open minded. Maybe you need to be more open minded and actually listen to her a little better about what she needs to feel supported.\n\nEdit: Also you said in a comment that she didn\u2019t even get any negative feedback from her manager. Only that she was doing great and to keep doing great. How can they explain she didn\u2019t deserve it without any constructive feedback and how is she supposed to take your advice of having an open mind on feedback if they didn\u2019t even give her any?", "YTA\n\nFor starters, she got no constructive feedback in her performance review by yoyr account, was essentially told to keep doing what she's doing, but still watched more recent hires get a bump in front of her. That's infuriating and not help, so your advice kinda sucks to begin with.\n\nYou don't work with her and see how she works, yet immediately assumed she couldn't possibly have these experiences at 2 places (spoiler alert for male dominated fields- entirely possible). That already shows her you don't trust her narrative \n\nShe was also venting it seems and not asking for career advice.", "YTA you have no idea what is happening at her work and should just listen.", "Did she ask you for feedback or was she just venting?", "YTA. You're a man, so you will never understand her feelings or her point of view. Your advice is shit. If people with dicks that started after her were promoted and she wasn't, for what reason did you think she was passed over? Her feedback from her performance was positive. STFU and listen to your (hopefully ex) gf because she has a vagina and is clearly experienced with putting up with sexist bullshit.", "YTA \n\nI agree with you that she should be open to feedback however, you basically took the boss' side for literally no reason instead of supporting your GF when she was upset. From everything you said in the post and in your comments, it does seem, at the very least, there is unconscious descrimination. You don't work there and don't see the dynamic yourself but are seemingly ready to not believe your GF when she says that there is an issue \n\nConsider it this way: imagine you're being bullied at school as a kid. All the teachers around you write it off as the other kids joking around. You tell your parents and they say \"are you sure you didn't deserve it?\" \n\nTldr, you reacted in the wrong order based on what you've said. You should have believed her and offered support before providing advice", "Wow you're poor girlfriend. Based on your description, you are just assuming she didn't deserve a promotion (and the new graduates did!), and that there is feedback she should consider but isn't. Do you even know what imposter syndrome is? It means she's probably great at her job, even though she might be insecure about it. If she's in a male dominated field, it is a statistical probability that sexism is at play. Given the above, you're a massive raging AH for not supporting your girlfriend. It's bad enough to be surrounded by sexism at work, imagine coming home to more of it. YTA.", "YTA. Her being passed over for a promotion in favour of more junior male employees is a prime example of sexism, as is your dismissal of her concerns.", "INFO:\n\nWhat kind of job?\n\nWhat kind of performance metrics was she falling short on?", "YTA. Her manager's feedback doesn't matter because he sexist bro", "Never mind what you told your gf.  Did she ASK for your feedback?\n\nMen share issues with each other looking for feedback and solutions.  However, quite often, women are just looking for comfort; they just want to be heard.  They don't want our advice, they want us to shut up and LISTEN!\n\nAs a guy, I find this very frustrating.  \"Don't tell me these things if you don't want my input!\" used to be my response.  I have learned otherwise.  I'll ask my gf/female friends:  \"Do you want comfort or advice right now?\", and then I'll go with that.\n\nSoft YTA", "\u2026why is your username\u2026.gffailures??? Tell me how you really feel about her yikes\n\nAlso, based on what you\u2019ve said, she didn\u2019t GET feedback. She didn\u2019t get any info on what she can do to get promoted, she got a fake pat on the back and watched the new guys get promoted. The crap you said to her is as useless as what her managers said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get it next year.\u201d What are you going to say if she doesn\u2019t?

If that is not gaslighting, I am not sure what is. That\u2019s absolutely common for women in many fields. They have to work much harder to overcome stereotypes that they are just an affirmative action hire. It couldn\u2019t possibly be that they got where they are due to their education, experience, and productivity. It is only because someone wanted to put a woman in that slot (similar situation with minorities in many positions).", "So, he's right to talk out of his ass, brush off her concerns, but that he should be empathetic because women 'might have emotional feelings.'

And the only person without a promotion just *happened* to be the only woman?? Yeah, that\u2019s straight up sexism. YTA. Even though you didn\u2019t outright say it might not be sexism, all of your suggestions downplay the pretty obvious sexism involved. Also, bringing up her insecurities about her ability to do her job well as an argument as to why she didn\u2019t get promoted is an AH move. It\u2019s hard being a woman in a male dominated field. Your contributions and expertise are constantly questioned, you get talked over in meetings, your ideas get stolen, you constantly feel the need to prove you belong there, and your mistakes feel magnified as though they\u2019re confirming the sexist bias that women are inferior.

Her training people is her 'natural job' as a woman - to make sure everyone else is comfortable.  It simply isn't being recognised as part of her performance at work.\n\nFor example, I've been accused of being 'too aggressive' when my male colleagues are praised as being 'assertive' for the exact same behaviour - they got promoted, and I didn't.   These were the examples I was given - even if I acted the same way as my male colleagues, what was seen as a positive in them would invariably be seen as a negative in me - seeing it happen to other women only made that more obvious to me.   Throughout my career I have seen doors open for men, that I had to kick in to get the same level of entry.

If you really want to help your gf, then suggest she make a meeting with her manager, and ask them specifically what she didn't do that she didn't deserve a promotion, and what she can do to ensure she gets it next time around.  She needs to remain calm and unemotional about it.   Write down a list of talking points, and take notes as they have this meeting.
