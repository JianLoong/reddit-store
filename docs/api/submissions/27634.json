It's been coming to a head recently as they just found out he's been skipping PE at school, and doing the bare minimum.\nMy husband and I had a half marathon race last weekend, and my MIL was booked in to bring our daughter (4F) along to watch. MIL then had a last minute emergency and couldn't do it, SIL very kindly offered to do the same. \nThe night before, SIL called to say that instead of waiting on part of the course to see us run by and the meet us at the finish, as she was also looking after her son (and the fact she thought it would be stressful with 2 kids) that they would do something else that morning and then meet us afterwards.\nAs I want my children to get exposure to sports events, I had to insist they watch the race and gave her my reasoning as SIL just didn't understand.

I've never given her reason to think that either.\nAITA here, for (my angry MILs words) not being emphathetic when their family is going through a rough patch?\n\nEdit: I want to make it clear that I never have and never will force my kids to actually do sport.

Immersion tends to work better. Enjoy! As for the OP NTA", "There are a few things I didn't quite understand.\n\nFirstly, if her son is overweight, I don't see what that has to do with him being a spectator in a sport, it's supposed to be a fun activity for a child. If SIL doesn't like to bring her son along, or if he's uncomfortable about coming along, it points to a much more serious problem : how the hell did they manage to get this child to have such a poor relationship with his body, and for a fun activity to lead him back to weight problems. Your SIL shouldn't relate everything to her son's weight, it's very unhealthy for both him and her.\n\nMy second point is that your SIL said she found it stressful to have to manage two children. I understand her and I think you shouldn't have insisted, she's already doing you a favor by looking after your daughter and agreeing to come, you forced her to do something she wasn't comfortable with and now you're surprised she's upset.\n\nYTA", "YTA for insisting on your SIL take your daughter. It inconvenienced her and it's actually very odd that you feel so strongly that a 4 year old absolutely can not miss an opportunity to watch you run by them in a race. It all sounds forceful and toxic to me. I'm a runner,  my daughter comes along in the stroller with us for 5 km runs all the time. This weekend we did a 10km at a very busy event.  We could have taken her as a \"family experience \" but she would have felt overwhelmed.  So we left her with our in-laws. Life it about balance and reasonable expectations. You are not role-modeling that well at all.", "NTA everyone here seems to be skipping over you offering SIL an out of something she OFFERED to do by saying your brother could bring your child.", "Yta.", "I say NTA. \n\nYou had a specific plan in place to have the kids brought to the race. It's no different than if she had promised to take them to a restaurant or the park and bailed at the last minute because it was \"too much\". \n\nShe had the right to do so, since she's the one watching them, but you, as the parent, have a right to have your plans followed through. Her trouble with her kid is her own thing, it has nothing to do with you. However, if all this seems too much for her, then I would avoid asking her to watch them in the future.\n\nAnd to all those saying she's \"nitpicking\" about free babysitting, it's not about that. She didn't just want someone to babysit, she wanted someone to take her kids to the race. If she can't do the thing they agreed upon (again, not saying that's SIL fault, just an unfortunate fact) then they have the right to find a new babysitter who can follow through.\n\nAlso, your bad childhoods do not mean that her children feel the same way. Don't assume you know their home life. Everyone (and therefore, every child) is different (just like some kids feel forced to go to church and others actually enjoy it).", "NTA. She offered, you said no to her wanting to change the plan AND told her that someone else was willing to do it if she didn\u2019t want to. You did nothing wrong. Wtf is with all the y t a?

You asked for a favor and someone obliged, that was the deal.  Additionally, seeing some healthy activity would be good for your nephew, whether you\u2019re judging him or not.  Furthermore, your own child is statistically proven to be more likely to lead a healthy and active lifestyle when witnessing a parent lead by example; those odds increase almost 30% when both parents are active.  Please visit r/running or r/ultrarunning to see the studies and discuss the positive aspects of sport.  Lastly, if someone kept my child, or anyone special frankly, from seeing me at a big event like you described, I\u2019d be livid. Your family puts in just as much work during training as you do, even if they\u2019re not running - and most people don\u2019t get that.  They deserve to relish in your success just as much as you.

Your sister obviously wasn't, but didn't want to back out and seem unsupportive. \n\nI'm going with NAH mainly because you have the right to want your daughter there, SIL has the right to be worried about her child even while watching yours.\n\nI still think 4 is a bit too young to understand the significance of your race, but that's just my opinion and as we all know...opinions are moo.", "Your sil is going to watch your 4 year old for free as a favor and needs to bring her own child... and you're going to dictate what they do when she babysits? The thought of watching a road race is mind numbingly boring. And I run and have raced, I played lacrosse as an adult, I hike, I go to the gym, but never once made my kids watch any of those activities. They are smart enough to figure it out. Yta. Has nothing to do with anyone's weight issue, has to do with your silly demands of their time when doing you a favor. Trust me, your child knows you exercise, she doesn't need to watch every race that's just ridiculous.", "YTA. \u201cI had to insist they watch the race\u201d. Why? Why was it so important for your FOUR YEAR OLD  watch you for all of 30 seconds? It\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to be running along the sidelines the whole race to watch you run, she\u2019d see you as you passed or at the finish line and that\u2019s it. Your SIL was helping you by watching your child, if you really wanted your child to watch one of you run (which is really weird btw) one of you should have dropped out of the race and watched your own damn kid.

Purely because your SIL is doing you a favour so you shouldn\u2019t be so demanding.", "I\u2019m going to go more on the side of YTA, or at least ESH. Not because I think you\u2019re inherently wrong for wanting to include your family in events or for trying to promote beneficial activities to your kids, which is all perfectly reasonable but more for how you handled the situation with your SIL. The fact of the matter is your original plan with your MIL fell through and your SIL offered to step in so at that point you definitely should\u2019ve offered yourself to let her do what was convenient for her and not give her a hard time. Now conversely, if your SIL really didn\u2019t feel up to this task she should\u2019ve just stuck to her guns and said so from the get go rather than doing it and acting petulant after on her end. \n\nBut the other thing is you say you don\u2019t want your kids to see exercising and related events as a chore, but if your kids see you getting this worked up and argumentative over just one occasion I question if that\u2019ll be the effect it has. And given there will likely be many more events they can watch in the future I think you need to address why you feel so strongly about this particular one; do you actually want to try and promote this to your kids, or is this just about them watching you in your moment?", "YTA\n\nNot for making your SIL do anything, because you didn't make her do anything, she could have opted out.\n\nNo you're an asshole for pretending that running a marathon is healthy. While it's actually a stresstest of your body and you risk injuring yourself. Running more than two marathons a year is actually seen as unhealthy. \n\nFor me personally seeing people run marathons has always made me question their sanity. Standing for hours watching a marathon is probably one of the most boring things I can imagine doing and I don't think it's giving your child the positive associations you want her to have with sports. If you want her to have positive associations with sports take her to a trampoline park, an ice rink or skate rink. Play catch and tag with her, take her to the swimming pool. Lots of options that don't involve making a 4 year old stand and watch a marathon for hours. \n\nOhhh and growing up I had the role that I must always do one sitting activity. I could choose what myself, but I had to do some sort of classes that involved moving. I did swimming, dance, circus, nun chakko, Jujitsu, more swimming and probably some other stuff I forgot about.", "YTA \n\n\u201cYou had to insist my SIL watch the race\u201d\n\nHahahahahahhahahahaha\n\nIf I was her I would have handed you your kid back!

I take my children to watch their dad do sporting events and I ask him for a rough estimation of the time he is aiming for. The kids and I go off and do something (park, ice cream, sandcastles on the beach etc) and then we go to the finish line and watch dad arrive.

I'm not understanding how the sister's fam going through a \"rough patch\" with her son being overweight and refusing do exercise is in any way related to her bringing the kids to see you run (when that is in fact what she agreed to doing)? Does her son have to be protected from seeing other people exercise because...it somehow triggers him? Do other people have to hide the fact that they enjoy doing sports because he hates it..? I'm not getting it, to be honest. She agreed to do it, she was offered to back out last minute and let the brother take over, she said no ok she will do it - now what is she upset about?

That he is overweight is something brought up by OP, but wasn't necessarily a concern for the SIL when she suggested that she wasn't up to trying to bring two kids to the race, find her way around whatever traffic routes were set up to somewhere to park, find the designated spot along the route at the time suggested by OP (assuming they set up a spot/time and didn't expect SIL to stand there with the kids for 2ish hours), and keep two kids occupied/entertained until OP and husband ran by.  But OP went on a whole thing about how how important it was for kids to see parents having fun exercising, which is when the situation with the overweight son was probably associated in SIL's mind.  (Although if she was concerned about bringing the child who she has been trying very hard to show that exercise is fun to a very boring event that OP was going to act like was the most fun thing ever, I wouldn't fault her for that.)   Yeah, she mentioned she would also have her son, but I would assume that would be \"And preteens are obnoxious when they get bored\" not \"And he has such a poor relationship with his body that he couldn't possibly see a race.\"", "that\u2019s fine.

Had she had a more balanced approach, I probably would have evened out during puberty but instead I developed disorder eating, and eventually actually did get fat.  My son is an athlete but he's gone from beanpole skinny to a little chunky the last couple years (10, 11) so we just keep him in his sports, switched to stocking healthier snacks and I've made a big effort to focus on cooking healthy meals and enjoying unhealthy foods in moderation.

OP is clearly very insistent that a young child get carted along to a spot on a marathon route to see her for perhaps a minute.
