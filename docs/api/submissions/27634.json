It's been coming to a head recently as they just found out he's been skipping PE at school, and doing the bare minimum.\nMy husband and I had a half marathon race last weekend, and my MIL was booked in to bring our daughter (4F) along to watch. MIL then had a last minute emergency and couldn't do it, SIL very kindly offered to do the same. \nThe night before, SIL called to say that instead of waiting on part of the course to see us run by and the meet us at the finish, as she was also looking after her son (and the fact she thought it would be stressful with 2 kids) that they would do something else that morning and then meet us afterwards.\nAs I want my children to get exposure to sports events, I had to insist they watch the race and gave her my reasoning as SIL just didn't understand. Edit: I insisted that the plan with my daughter was to go to the race, and my brother could do it if she didn't want to anymore. She said it was fine and took the kids along, but I have now been told she's really upset that I'm rubbing in my parenting styles when she's going through a tough time of her own. \nI want it clear that I could not care less how she parents her kids, she's an amazing mum and I have zero opinion on what's going on with her son. I've never given her reason to think that either.\nAITA here, for (my angry MILs words) not being emphathetic when their family is going through a rough patch?\n\nEdit: I want to make it clear that I never have and never will force my kids to actually do sport. I'm just hoping my efforts mean that they want to do it by themselves, and not see it as a chore.

I understand wanting to impart a positive association in your kids about sports. Surely, though, missing part of your race to have fun with her aunt and cousin wouldn't derail her entire development.

You may actually believe you aren't judging your sister in laws parenting but I highly doubt that's true from the tone of your post.", "YTA, but this has nothing to do with your parenting skills or her son. \n\nYTA because your SIL jumped in last minute to help you, and your priority was not to at least try to minimize the stress on her, but instead contribute to it due to your ideals. \n\nI think you owe her an apology and a coupon to a really nice day spa nearby with the offer to watch her son, so she can relax.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s doing you a favour and you put her in a position she wasn\u2019t comfortable in, she suggested a reasonable alternative to accommodate everyone (while still doing YOU a favour), but you shot her down so\u2026.a four year old could watch strangers running in a group waiting for her parents to wave as they passed by?\n\nSomehow I don\u2019t think standing on the sidelines watching people run is going to inspire any 4 year old. \n\nIf you want to impart exercise ideals on your child, try doing something that involves them in actual activity.

You might try acting like it.", "YTA, frankly you sound rather narcissistic; why must YOU be watched, and observed at all times?", "Yta. \nShe\u2019s 4. I was dragged to \u201cwatch\u201d my dad and step mum do triathlons all through my childhood. I promise you, I wasn\u2019t watching them, I was bored stupid. We know you run and compete. Seeing you at the finish line is a great compromise. My husband does ultra marathons. The only one our kids went to was his first one, and we spent the day at the lake before going to the finish line. She\u2019s doing you a favour ffs", "YTA\n\nYour SIL was doing you and your husband a favour by looking after your daughter.\n\nYTA for demanding she does what you want to do, with her free time.

I can't imagine your SIL ever volunteering to babysit for you again.", "Your daughter is 4, I recommend mommy daughter sports. There's classes out there and otherwise online vids. Immersion tends to work better. Enjoy! As for the OP NTA", "There are a few things I didn't quite understand.\n\nFirstly, if her son is overweight, I don't see what that has to do with him being a spectator in a sport, it's supposed to be a fun activity for a child. If SIL doesn't like to bring her son along, or if he's uncomfortable about coming along, it points to a much more serious problem : how the hell did they manage to get this child to have such a poor relationship with his body, and for a fun activity to lead him back to weight problems. Your SIL shouldn't relate everything to her son's weight, it's very unhealthy for both him and her.\n\nMy second point is that your SIL said she found it stressful to have to manage two children. I understand her and I think you shouldn't have insisted, she's already doing you a favor by looking after your daughter and agreeing to come, you forced her to do something she wasn't comfortable with and now you're surprised she's upset.\n\nYTA", "YTA for insisting on your SIL take your daughter. It inconvenienced her and it's actually very odd that you feel so strongly that a 4 year old absolutely can not miss an opportunity to watch you run by them in a race. It all sounds forceful and toxic to me. I'm a runner,  my daughter comes along in the stroller with us for 5 km runs all the time. This weekend we did a 10km at a very busy event.  We could have taken her as a \"family experience \" but she would have felt overwhelmed.  So we left her with our in-laws. Life it about balance and reasonable expectations. You are not role-modeling that well at all.", "NTA everyone here seems to be skipping over you offering SIL an out of something she OFFERED to do by saying your brother could bring your child.", "Yta.", "I say NTA. \n\nYou had a specific plan in place to have the kids brought to the race. It's no different than if she had promised to take them to a restaurant or the park and bailed at the last minute because it was \"too much\". \n\nShe had the right to do so, since she's the one watching them, but you, as the parent, have a right to have your plans followed through. Her trouble with her kid is her own thing, it has nothing to do with you. However, if all this seems too much for her, then I would avoid asking her to watch them in the future.\n\nAnd to all those saying she's \"nitpicking\" about free babysitting, it's not about that. She didn't just want someone to babysit, she wanted someone to take her kids to the race. If she can't do the thing they agreed upon (again, not saying that's SIL fault, just an unfortunate fact) then they have the right to find a new babysitter who can follow through.\n\nAlso, your bad childhoods do not mean that her children feel the same way. Don't assume you know their home life. Everyone (and therefore, every child) is different (just like some kids feel forced to go to church and others actually enjoy it).", "NTA. She offered, you said no to her wanting to change the plan AND told her that someone else was willing to do it if she didn\u2019t want to. You did nothing wrong. Wtf is with all the y t a? It\u2019s not the woman had no choice.", "Holy sh*t you\u2019re not the asshole.  Please don\u2019t think you are despite the resounding amounts of votes that say otherwise.  You asked for a favor and someone obliged, that was the deal.  Additionally, seeing some healthy activity would be good for your nephew, whether you\u2019re judging him or not.  Furthermore, your own child is statistically proven to be more likely to lead a healthy and active lifestyle when witnessing a parent lead by example; those odds increase almost 30% when both parents are active.  Please visit r/running or r/ultrarunning to see the studies and discuss the positive aspects of sport.  Lastly, if someone kept my child, or anyone special frankly, from seeing me at a big event like you described, I\u2019d be livid. Your family puts in just as much work during training as you do, even if they\u2019re not running - and most people don\u2019t get that.  They deserve to relish in your success just as much as you.  They\u2019re the lazy asshole, not you.   NTA", "YTA", "YTA", "YTA.

So everything is fine.", "Well, NTA I guess. Imo you\u2019re a healthy example for her kid and perhaps he should be watching too.

Wouldn't you play games and do activities with the kids if you want to teach them that being active is fun? \n\nOP is framing this as a thing that's being done for the kid's future but it's really just all about OP having people support him at his race.

It's really hard to keep track of small kids in crowds - especially if they aren't yours).\n\nGoing to the science museum and seeing the science of the schoolyard? Absolutely FUN. Going to the park. Going on walks in the woods with someone who knows about the local flora and fauna and maybe a story or two? FUN Apple picking?
