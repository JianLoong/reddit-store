And I get it - you know what you need to do and you're ready to do it - but people don't typically use ATMs as often as they used to. There's a better than average chance that you'll get behind someone who hasn't used one in years. \n\nIf you're using one so often that it's causing you ongoing frustration, maybe a better idea would be to plan around busy ATM times?\n\nYTA", "Such a typical Londoners view on life in that you think you\u2019re the centre of the universe. \n\nI\u2019ve read all the comments that have been made so far and I\u2019m going to break it down for you so you can truly understand as you\u2019re requesting. \n\n1. No one said looking down on thieves is not good. You\u2019ve chosen to focus on that and not on the fact that your tone for this whole post has a disdain for the world. Saying things like you\u2019re \u201csurrounded by one ignoramus after another\u201d and calling people plebs makes you sound like you think you\u2019re superior to everyone else and your conception of how long it should take to use a cash point is the correct one. \n\nThat leads us to point 2:\n2. If you are frequently annoyed at how slow people go then your expectations for how long it should take to use a cash point are wrong. Most people do it around the same rate and it should be noticeably slower for you to become upset, so if it\u2019s happening all the time it means you are impatient with the average. They might be old, a tourist, have a learning disability, be having a terrible day, etc. but ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter because it isn\u2019t up to you to decide how long people take. Your choices are to wait patiently or leave the queue if it\u2019s taking too long, not shaming someone for not confirming to your desires. \n\nI don\u2019t know how you behave in real life but the attitude above is real unattractive both personally and professionally, and if you\u2019re not careful may lead to you getting a smack in the chops if you say something to the wrong person. YTA", "NTA\n\nYou can take as much time as you want with the machine for as long as you're the only one using it. Otherwise, try to stick to 1 or 2 transactions on the ATM. 10 mins is waaaaay too long to be on the machine, even for the older/slower/don't know how to use the ATM machine. The only time I've used the machine for more than 2 mins is when I had to do multiple withdrawals because the machine can only allow a certain max amount per withdrawal. I had to stay at the machine for about 6 mins and most of the time it was due to the slow processing of the machine. I had to apologize to people on the queue too but I explained that the machine is quite slow.", "Edit: NTA for saying it to move them along, but good god, this post reads like someone who is always on the go.

They won't be faster just because you are making a scene. In some cases you can make them even more stressed which can be a reason why it takes even more time for them. In my country every bank institution have their own kind of ATMs with different panels and menus. Once I had to use the ATM of another bank because I didn't have one nearby me of my own bank's and it took me almost 15 minutes to figure out how it works. (My bank's ATM has an option that offers me to choose the bank notes I want to get from the ATM and not only the amount of money. But this ATM I had to use didn't have that option. First I had to figure that out and after that I had to make 7 different take outs (entering, choosing and giving pin 7 times separately) to get the exact notes I needed).

I couldn\u2019t be further from a Londoner in terms of atypical traits and lifestyle. \n\nI\u2019m from the west of Ireland.

Londoners tend to think it\u2019s their world and everybody else just lives in it, therefore I find that the ignorance and inconsideration towards others is RIFE in this city. And even more so when I open my mouth and out comes the Irish accent.\n\nI just wanted to clear that up bc I\u2019m not going to lie, online comments and interactions usually just go over my head but that one weirdly struck a nerve.

I don\u2019t feel bad for saying that at all because why should I feel bad for frowning upon BAD people?\n\nOf course not every single person that\u2019s ever stolen something in their life is a fundamentally bad person or long time criminal and so I\u2019m not being hyperbolic here.. but I\u2019ve gotten to the point of really not caring to police my words or rhetoric when it comes to people doing shit things because before I moved here I really was under the impression that all humans were innately good but some have just made bad choices. After spending the last year homeless and sleeping rough in a Morrisons car park at times, it\u2019s safe to say that wishful thinking and naivety has been very much stomped out. \n\nI\u2019m not bitter or super cynical or anything like that now. Just going to call a spade a spade and yeah - there are thugs and plebs and ignoramuses in this world. Do I lose sleep over them?
