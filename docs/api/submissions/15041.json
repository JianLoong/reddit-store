Now that my husband and I have children (2 year old + almost newborn) she insists on staying with us for a week every 2 months so she can see her grandchildren.

I don\u2019t want to keep her from her grandchildren, but at the same time I am tired of hosting a high maintenance person every two months.

My mother also lived far away when my children were young, but when she would come for a visit, she would be HELPFUL, so her visits were a welcome relief, not nearly as frequent as every 2 months either.

In both cases, think about what you want for you. Postpartum period is THE time where we need to be selfish.", "NTA. The only people that are welcome just after the birth is the kind that would be helpful. Also, as a general rule if she is visiting her grandchild, surely she would welcome the opportunity to have grandma-baby bonding time while you guys have a date night, right? If she is unwilling to do that, even with the 2-year-old, then she is basically using your house as her holiday destination.", "Omg. \nJust the thought of someone coming to stay in my house every 8 weeks for 1 whole week makes me feel horrible.

Six weeks a year is a ridiculous amount to host an easy guest, let alone someone high maintenance.  If I were you I'd put my foot down with my husband that I'd be up for hosting in my home up to 2 weeks a year, not all at once and not for a few months after having a baby.  That's about how much I could tolerate.  You are well within your rights to tolerate even less than that.", "NTA. She is being an overbearing mooch. You are not keeping her from her grandkids. You are telling her she may not stay at your house for a week every 2 months. If she is motivated enough to see them then she can stop spending money on something else or spring for a hotel.  When you consider the fact that she turns down staying with her sister there is a clear element of the power play going on here. She is demanding she control access to your house and family on her terms, and her terms alone. Don't fall for it. Politely tell her it is her sisters or a hotel if she wants to visit. If she balks, to bad. Does your husband have your back with this?", "NTA.\n\nYour husband needs to grow a spine and tell his mother that you aren't a full service resort, that you cannot, and will not, be providing her with a room, food, cooking, cleaning, and laundry for her, like she has expected in all prior visits.

She\u2019s family - and she wants to see those babies - she\u2019ll accept your terms no matter how you phrase it. Just make sure she knows you love her after you not-so-gently tell her it\u2019s a hotel or her car. It\u2019s better to just be honest calmly vs letting it build up to the point where you explode with anger and resentment and say something in a way you\u2019ll truly regret.", "NTA. We have recently had to scale back the number of times my mom visits a year. She is now retired and would love to come every 2-3 months for around 10 days. It\u2019s too much for me, way too much for my spouse, and turns our oldest into a boundary pushing monster. We have settled on around 3 times a year. 30 days a year still seems like a lot, but it\u2019s a compromise we are willing to make. \n\nMy mom barely makes an effort to call when she isn\u2019t here and that plays into our decision too. I\u2019m usually the one who calls to check in on her. My sister and here 2 kids live 15 minutes from her and it\u2019s obvious that is where her priorities lie.

But you need to put your foot down, not just \u201cgently suggest\u201d anything. Suggesting means she can blow you off and do what she wants. Your husband needs to TELL his mother that she can stay with her sister or get a hotel, but she will not be staying with you. It\u2019s not a negotiation.
