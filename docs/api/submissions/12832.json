Mostly it\u2019s due to me feeling very unappreciated and carrying the mental load. My husband is also very laid back he is rarely on time and just moves at slow speed. Which frustrates me because I don\u2019t like to be late. \n\nWe have two kids 2f and 6mths f. I am preparing for major exams in June so lately after the kids are in bed at night I will study into the night and I have asked him to handle the mornings with the kids. When my mom picks 2f up from I usually then receive a phone call about she being untidy her hair not being combed properly or how late she went to school (they have a sign in book). \n\nLast night I packed her lunch bag and put out her clothes. He just had to change her, brush her hair, make breakfast and change the babies diaper this morning. He however slept through his alarm I had to wake up at 7:15 realise he was still asleep and wake him up. Woke up again at 7:45 realise our daughter is still asleep. I call him he\u2019s making pancakes. I tell him just make a sandwich it\u2019s late. I get out of bed and had both kids ready by 8am. He then spends the next 35 minutes watering his plants and showering so she\u2019s now late for school. \n\nHe asks me why I\u2019m annoyed and I lost my shit a bit because I talked to him just yesterday about how unhappy I am and how much mental load is on me. I tell him if he knew he had to water plants and shower he should have just made a sandwich. He tells me he made enough for me.

He may think he is helping because he is acting based on what he thinks your needs are. Raising kids requires razor sharp communications. Definitely recommend couples counseling to work on communication.", "NTA You're right he IS incompetent if he can't comb his kids hair right and take them to school on time. Personally I would divorce him or go to counseling.", "NTA\n\nThere are so many married single mothers out there. You should be able to trust he can get things done as a parent without your intervention and not be another child for you to take care of. If he wants to act like one feel free to discipline him like one girl", "NTA, but he's actually not incompetent. If he can remember to water his plants, he can remember to take care of his kids. Stop pleading, give up on reasoning with him\u2014he knows already.  Ask your mother if she can come get the kids together in the mornings just on the mornings after you've been up late studying, and just until exams are over.  (I would do this on a short term basis if one of my daughters were in your shoes.) If she can't, can you hire someone just for this period of time, or get a friend in? Don't explain anything to your husband other than that you have found someone to take the next morning on and he should expect that person to be there.  I have no idea what his goal is here, but the effect could be of you failing school, or failing to do well enough to get ahead.  So if he keeps making you to lose sleep, he needs an \"actions have consequences\" moment. Maybe a couple of his beloved plants could disappear and you could leave a note, \"let the wife sleep or the plants die.\"", "NTA\n\nHe definitely needs to understand the definition of compromise. \n\nThis sounds so familiar.  \n\nI left my daughter's Dad for this reason and got full custody of her.  \n\nIn the end he never changed.\n\nYou cannot change other people's behavior, you can only change yourself and I would reevaluate your circumstances.", "NTA - Look up weaponized incompetence. People have schedules, and if his being \"laid back\" is making your daughter late for school, that's a problem. He's *wasn't* \"doing it,\" which is why you *did* have to get up. If he was *doing it*, then she'd have been on time. She wasn't on time. Ergo, he wasn't *doing it.*", "Counseling or divorce.\n\nNTA", "NTA, very few things are frustrating as feign incompetence. Trust me, he knows what he is doing and playing stupid. I have a same one at home, but I dont have kids and we are not married so he \"snaps out of it\" as soon as I indicate that I can leave whenever I want.", "NTA. I've dealt with similar nonsense so I know how frustrating it can be.", "NTA - it's weaponized incompetence. He knows you'll get up to do all of this and he can take his sweet time making his preferred breakfast and shower. No matter what the commitment is, he should have to share the load and he's not right now.", "NTA you called him exactly what he was being", "NTA.\n\nWeaponized incompetence is a thing and your husband seems to have it down to a science.  He doesn't want to have to help.", "NTA, but are these behaviors new?  I can't imagine that suddenly after having 2 kids his habits have changed.   Did he want children?  It doesn't seem like it, for sure.  Sounds like you put yourself in a difficult situation, having two kids while still in school.  You need to sit down with him and explain how you feel and what you need from him if this is going to work.  How he handles that is up to him.  And how you react to that is up to you.  \n\nPeople treat you how you allow them to.", ">He said I was being unfair and he was doing it I didn\u2019t need to get out of bed that\u2019s on me.\n\nThe entire point of you getting out of bed is that he **WASN\u2019T DOING IT!!!!!**\n\nYou need to have a serious talk with him, no \"i don't feel like talking\", no \"i was on it\", no whatever excuse he has.\n\nTALK and let him know that this shit stops **TODAY** and if not..........put consequences to his actions. (*You know what those consequences should be*)\n\n>He then spends the next 35 minutes watering his plants and showering so she\u2019s now late for school.\n\nThat tells you everything you need to know about it.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to water the plants when you're already running late.\n\nHe just simply does not give a shit.\n\nNTA and GOOD LUCK!!!!!", "NTA. I too have a 36m spouse. This post could have been written about him. In my husband\u2019s case his mother made all his life decisions so he never learned to make them himself. She robbed him of the opportunity to make a mistake and figure out how to fix it, or learn coping skills when mistakes are made.", "NTA. Sounds like you have different parenting styles and his makes you anxious. Incompetent was a loaded term but he should take the point that either he needs to change his behaviour or it will continue to upset you. Or you need to accept being late is what your household does even if you don't like to be late yourself. It's also a real faff for schools for kids to be late so if he doesn't mind upsetting you maybe he could try to put himself in the shoes of the school staff. My daughters hair is a birds nest and she still looks adorable so the hair combing comment from your mom sounds OTT.", "NTA. I do want to point something out, kids typically don't start pre-k until ages 3 or 4. This morning stress isn't a stress that you have to have.", "NTA but let go of your daughter needing tidy hair.", "I\u2019m feeling like YTA. She\u2019s going to daycare, not real school, correct? \n\nAnd your mom calling you to say her hair is untidy? Really over the top. \n\nHaving kids is hard. It sounds like you want your husbands help but you also want total control.", "ESH if he agreed to take the kids to school on time, he should have kept to that. However, the kids are 2 & 6 months at that age it\u2019s not like they\u2019re missing out if they are at \u201cschool\u201d late, getting a little extra sleep, a good breakfast, and maybe a little extra family is more important for their development. You two should talk about what\u2019s realistic and important for the kids in the morning & if he\u2019s handling it, let him do so & don\u2019t worry about it.

Or have you changed?", "Sounds like he needs a new tool in his toolbox - competence.", "That made me chuckle thanks for that", "My daughter turns 3 in June she also has a speech delay. We made the choice with the school to place her in the pre school area where she can get a lot more one on one attention and be around kids all of whom are speaking vs the toddler area. Part of it is also routine. Not all mornings we can take her and my mom does and she goes early and settles better vs mornings he does when she\u2019s rushed and cries.", "She is in the preschool not the daycare. She has a speech delay so the decision was made and supported that she go into the preschool area since she\u2019s turning 3 in June anyway to get more one on one attention and be around kids who are speaking. \n\nPart of wanting her to go on time. Is so she can play and interact before the start of the day. Also we aren\u2019t always the ones able to take her sometimes my mom has to and it messes up her routine because they take her in on time", "That\u2019s exactly the vibe I\u2019m getting here and seeing the comment of \u201cwanting her to go on time so she can play and interact before they start the day\u201d tells me that she wants to control the situation. The kid doesn\u2019t NEED to be there at the time that she wants her there and husband knows this.", "Just because it\u2019s not as important now for the kids to be on time doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not an issue. If he can\u2019t mange his time now, how will he fair in situations where being on time is important. It\u2019s causing the wife stress as she feels she cannot depend on her husband to do a simple morning routine", "OP needs to make a timed checklist so the husband can stay on task with no excuses.", "Alright then. You're gonna have to work the system then. So here's a psychological trick. Unfortunately, our partners aren't going to just know and do what we want. So we have to kinda train out partners and they have to train us. If he did anything right thank him and compliment him for it. That will encourage him to do that thing again. It's a little step forward but once you get that momentum going it'll get easier over time.", "But are we sure that it\u2019s not because he\u2019s not meeting her demands? I can understand the frustration on her end but the 2 yr old isn\u2019t late for \u201cschool\u201d it\u2019s not pre kinder or above where being on time is vital and maybe the husband knows that and has chosen to move at his pace but she\nwants things done her way. If we were talking about a school age kid, I\u2019d totally be on her side but to me this reads that she wants things done her way. She chose to get out of bed and get them ready when he could\u2019ve done it at his pace, she didn\u2019t like his pace. So unless I\u2019m missing something here, it sounds like she\u2019s causing the stress on herself.\n\nETA: \nshe made a comment that she wants her to go at a certain time so that she can play and interact before they start the day at said school. So she doesn\u2019t NEED to be there at that time. She wants her to which is her being controlling. Also morning routines aren\u2019t simple when it comes to kids.", "Oh yes, what OP needs is more of the mental load and responsibility /s", "That\u2019s more-or-less where I am & what I can\u2019t figure out too. The question is have they had a conversation about this? Because it\u2019s important that they have clear agreement on the morning plan.", "It sounds like he\u2019s being nit picked into the high heavens. Grandma calls to tell mom that her hair isn\u2019t tidy and that she was late again that day. Something tells me that he can\u2019t do anything right so he does it how he wants because it\u2019s not going to be right anyway. That\u2019s the vibe I\u2019m going with. The age of the kid and the want for her to be there at a certain time is what makes me think that she\u2019s being the AH. Dad sucks too because he\u2019s not bending knowing that she wants things done a certain way but who knows if there is room for compromise from both ends but It doesn\u2019t sound like there is.", "Oh and grandma complaining to her can\u2019t be helping the situation.", "That\u2019s why I went with \u201cESH.\u201d Open communication & agreement is what seems to be missing.", "I just read some of OPs other posts, & grandma sure sounds like a nitpicker. Not sure why OP is taking her side on this one.", "I took a look now that you pointed that out. I\u2019m sure grandma has rubbed off on OP in some ways as well.
