Mostly it\u2019s due to me feeling very unappreciated and carrying the mental load. My husband is also very laid back he is rarely on time and just moves at slow speed. Which frustrates me because I don\u2019t like to be late. \n\nWe have two kids 2f and 6mths f. I am preparing for major exams in June so lately after the kids are in bed at night I will study into the night and I have asked him to handle the mornings with the kids. When my mom picks 2f up from I usually then receive a phone call about she being untidy her hair not being combed properly or how late she went to school (they have a sign in book). \n\nLast night I packed her lunch bag and put out her clothes. He just had to change her, brush her hair, make breakfast and change the babies diaper this morning. He however slept through his alarm I had to wake up at 7:15 realise he was still asleep and wake him up. Woke up again at 7:45 realise our daughter is still asleep. I call him he\u2019s making pancakes. I tell him just make a sandwich it\u2019s late. I get out of bed and had both kids ready by 8am. He then spends the next 35 minutes watering his plants and showering so she\u2019s now late for school. \n\nHe asks me why I\u2019m annoyed and I lost my shit a bit because I talked to him just yesterday about how unhappy I am and how much mental load is on me. I tell him if he knew he had to water plants and shower he should have just made a sandwich. He tells me he made enough for me. I said I\u2019d have preferred to sleep and not have to get up to do everything myself because he\u2019s incompetent. He said I was being unfair and he was doing it I didn\u2019t need to get out of bed that\u2019s on me.\n\nEdit: Since everyone is asking about my daughter in the comments. She is 2 turning 3 in June and has a speech delay. Every speech therapist has a waiting list and most don\u2019t want to start therapy till she is a bit older. She was not very well socialized due to Covid. When we started her at this school we (he was right there in the meeting and agreed with the decision) to put her into the pre school area where she was around kids who spoke and had one on one attention from the teacher. So they are in school. Why I want her to get there by or before 8:30 is because when we don\u2019t take her and my mom does she gets there earlier and it throws her off the mornings we take her and she\u2019s late and she can\u2019t play or interact and has to go straight into class and sit and get to whatever activities are planned.", "created_utc": 1679404661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xgl4s/aita_for_telling_my_husband_hes_incompetent/", "score": 599, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't explain anything to your husband other than that you have found someone to take the next morning on and he should expect that person to be there.  I have no idea what his goal is here, but the effect could be of you failing school, or failing to do well enough to get ahead.

Sounds like you have different parenting styles and his makes you anxious. Incompetent was a loaded term but he should take the point that either he needs to change his behaviour or it will continue to upset you.

It's their marriage after all. But did you read what OP said? She feels unappreciated & carrying mental load. OP seems to be studying on top of everything. I just find it funny that a woman who feels unappreciated have to literally compliment his husband for the things he should be doing normally. Does he need to feel good to keep doing it? It's like complimenting someone for washing the dishes they used. Lol. On top of everything, it's still her job to do these behavioral therapy that you're saying? What about her? Who got her back? People get tired too lol"]}
