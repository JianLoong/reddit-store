November and December are my busiest time of the year when I make a lot of money that allows me to work less during the year. I\u2019ve been doing this since I was 25 so I\u2019ve got a decent idea of what I can and cannot do. And focusing on work only for 1-2 months is a sacrifice I\u2019m willing to make for chill rest of the year.\n\nThis year, I\u2019ve moved in with my boyfriend (m35). Well, technically he moved in with me because i own the house so it was a no brainier for him to move in with me.\n\nWe split chores half and half. He works full time (37.5 hours a week). When he moved in, I had a talk with him letting him know that I can\u2019t do any chores in November/December and asked if he could pick up the slack because I\u2019m physically unable to do any chores as I can be working anything  between 12-18 hours a day (I take a full January off to decompress). He said he doubted I worked that much but we will see.\n\nI asked again in September and October to make sure he was aware that I won\u2019t be doing anything (I meal prepped in advance) and I felt he kind of dismissed me.\nMid November, we had an argument about my chores not being done and I reminded him of what I told him.\n\nHe said that he thought I wasn\u2019t being serious and told me there\u2019s no way he\u2019d do 100% of chores because he\u2019s working too. I said fine, don\u2019t do my chores, they can wait until I have time. That\u2019s how it was when I lived alone, no problem, I don\u2019t make much mess anyway.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t happy but dropped it.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen each other much because I\u2019ve been working so much but he\u2019s been more and more pissed off and blew up at me today regarding the chores.\n\nHe said I had to have a better work life balance and to grow up because the house was a mess. I told him if it was a mess it was his fault because I barely leave my office.\n\nHe called me a lazy bitch. I told him k didn\u2019t have time for arguing and went back working.\n\nHe stood in front of my locked office door shouting how he couldn\u2019t believe I was bei mg serious about not doing chores and it was an asshole move to leave it all to him.\n\nHe thinks I\u2019m a major asshole for basically disappearing for 2 months and following through with not doing chores. \n\nAm I really the asshole for saying I won\u2019t do chores and following through?\n\nSorry for any typos, I\u2019m on mobile and my autocorrect hates me.", "created_utc": 1670182217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcj17j/aita_for_saying_that_i_cant_do_any_chores_in/", "score": 16683, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And it\u2019s not always a work reason, there could be health issues, the birth of a child, travel and a billion other things that come up.

NTA", "Nta- you gave him a warning, and it sounds like he just isn\u2019t cleaning up after himself. Tell him to start cleaning as he go (if he can) or just deal with his mess.

I'd end things immediately if my partner ever called me that. Wow..", "NTA- he\u2019s not respecting you or your job. Additionally, he should be paying you rent.

RUN!", "NTA\n\nThis is YOUR house. You have also been very clear with him about what to expect leading up to the holidays with your online business. If he doesn't like it, he needs to live in his own place. I can't even imagine tolerating him calling you a lazy bitch when he's living in YOUR home! WTF!", "NTA. Girl this man is living in the house you own and he won\u2019t help out with chores so you can continue with the business that allows him to live there. \n\nYou told him and he chose to assume you were lying.  Honestly this should be all you need to know. \n\nI know people with businesses like this. I just expect not to have any meaningful interaction with them from mid-Nov until the New Year. \n\nYou need to be aware that if you plan on having children with him this is exactly how he will be. \u201cI doubt looking after a new born is *that* much work, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d \n\nAlso, the behavior you are describing and the language he is using towards you is abuse. \n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA.

Only one of you seem to be communicating and that\u2019s not him. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou told him, repeatedly. He chose to blow that off. Then when the reality hit of what you had repeatedly told him, he called you names and told you to grow up. In your house. \n\nIt\u2019s not even about whether you could do the chores or not.

He moved into your house and your life, you told him from the beginning and reminded him ever so often and he doesnt have the capacity to understand? He didn't believe you? Sounds like a him problem. Does he need a maid to clean up his mess? \n\nI would throw him out, clearly communication is not a good fit for him and in the future you will not be able to talk about things that are even more important. Everyone needs a spouse that understands and supports them, not this childish shit.\n\nThe correct approach from his side would be him saying this, THE FIRST TIME YOU TOLD HIM: I understand, okay, i can pick up these chores in those two months, however i can, and maybe if you have a little time we can do a fast cleanup together so we could have a nice home for Christmas and then deep clean in January. I am glad you are doing something you love and i want to support in in every way i can.", "Gurl, dump this guy and kick him out of your house. NTA.", "NTA! \nYou are barely leaving your office, what mess could you have aside from laundry? \nWhat are your chores and what are his?", "NTA. He sucks, the way he reacted is horrible and shows zero respect for you. I wouldn't want to live with someone like that. On top of that it's mainly his mess and you had done food prep beforehand. You were prepared and warned him.", "NTA at all. \n\nHe was warned before he moved in with you. You told him the terms of cohabitation during this time of year. He seemed ok with them until it was time to follow through. \n\nOP, I would be very, very reluctant to continue this relationship if he doesn\u2019t realize this is your life. My husband is a political consultant during election years. He had 13 clients this year (the most he\u2019d ever had). I\u2019m a virtual teacher so I work from home. I knew without him even having to tell me that I would have to step up and take care of some extra stuff around the house, and I gladly did it because I know that his work means a lot to him. And sure, the money it brings in doesn\u2019t suck. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to beg or even repeat yourself to defend your work. Your work has gotten you to a very stable place in life and you should be proud of that. I would think being your partner, he would be too. \n\nYou definitely deserve better, OP", "NTA I bet it isn't even that much to do. Between not listening to you, living at your house, insulting you, and not cleaning his own mess, I don't see any redeeming qualities.", "NTA.\n\nHe sounds awful. Kick him out & change your locks.", "NTA. You were clear and upfront about the situation before moving in together and you haven\u2019t even expected BF to pick up your slack, given you said it can wait til January. \n\nI don\u2019t like the sound of him tbh, seems like he thought you\u2019d adapt everything around him, even though you were clear beforehand. Did he think his golden dick would make you give up your career? \ud83e\udd14 how dare he tantrum at you about your BUSINESS in YOUR house?! \n\nHe verbally abused you and tried to stop you working, what would he have done do your office door wasn\u2019t locked? All because you aren\u2019t cleaning? Does he actually do his fair share of chores? Is this because he doesn\u2019t have your attention? What has he done in previous years when you\u2019ve been this busy- how can this have been such a shock to him? \n\nPleas dump his crappy ass- there are no answers to the above questions that will excuse his behaviour.", "NTA. You told him how it would be and he's pissed off that you were honest. Maybe he needs to move out if he has such a big problem with it.", "NTA\n\nYou absolutely explained your *routine* and he didn\u2019t believe you, that\u2019s on him. It\u2019s also on him to be appalled to do chores as if he wouldn\u2019t be doing 100% of the chores if he lived on his own; you\u2019re not changing his routine for him, he shouldn\u2019t for you. He literally lives in your house, you\u2019re allowed to establish rules when letting someone into your space.", "NTA. This guy doesn't listen to you, doesn't believe you, and screams vile insults at you for doing exactly what you said you'd do, because he chose not to listen. You have a successful business and own your own home, you don't need a disrespectful AH in your life calling you a lazy bitch for not cleaning up messes that are largely HIS doing right now. Kick his ass to the curb and find someone who actually listens to you and respects you.", "NTA. He moved in to have someone take care of him and clean up after him. He got pissed when he realized his fantasy wasn't going to come true.\nEdited for spelling", "NTA. He can get out of your house talking to you like that. He didn\u2019t take you seriously and now he\u2019s suffering for it. That\u2019s on him.", "Soooo how long have you been together? Surely he would know that you work basically all through November and December, unless y\u2019all haven\u2019t been together that long. And his attitude is really funny, because I work anywhere from 40-50 hours a week, while my husband has a full time job and is in grad school, so I do most of the chores. Yeah I WFH so I try to do as much as I can on my breaks, and while it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s absolutely manageable. He works 37.5 hours a week. Even if he leaves the house, he can absolutely help out and do the chores. That\u2019s called being a partner. And it\u2019s only for a couple of months out of the year. He can go live somewhere else with that attitude. NTA.", "NTA. I work for a business that is technically seasonal. My summers are hectic. My winters are much calmer, and just like you said, you do a deep clean in January, and thats about where I am now.\n\nI live by myself, so I will admit that I compensate in the summer by having a cleaning service come in once every couple weeks just to make sure nothing goes absolutely disgusting.\n\nYou've said he seems unwilling to have another discussion, so it may be all moot, but I'd suggest that if/when you do you might want to consider offering to do more in your slower months...or if you can afford it, hiring someone to come in during November and December. Who knows, maybe you can BOTH take November and December off from chores....", "NTA he can get tf out", "NTA, but you would be if you didn't kick him out.", "NTA, give him the keys to the street.", "NTA and there is no situation in which it\u2019s okay for your partner to call you a lazy bitch. I hope you reconsider the relationship.", "NTA sounds like his true colours have finally shown...and since you're cooped up in a office 12-18 hours a day...who's making the mess??", "NTA time to file an eviction", "Info: why are you letting a disrespectful person who calls you a bitch while living off the fruit of your labour mooch off you", "Nta tell if if he doesn\u2019t like it he can leave.  By the way does he pay you rent?  You could engage a cleaner for your two month duration period.  Inform him if he keeps being aggressive about the issue you will eject him from the property.", "NTA\n\n\nHow much can that be? Especially if you told him, to just leave yours undone. \n\n\nI assume you would do everything in january if you have the month off. \n\n\nI just cant grasp that you talked and talked and talked about it and he just ignored it.", "NTA - but your bf sure is. Focus on your work and do your best, let him stew on it. Then once January hits, sit him down and make him understand how busy you were and that it will happen every year. If he is not prepared for that, than he is not prepared to live with you, simple as that.", "NTA, are you charging him rent?", "NTA and sounds like you guys moved in after dating less than a year which is always a big risk to take.\n\nA good compromise would be to hire a maid for those 2 months, but honestly if he's reacting this way it doesn't sound like it's about the chores it's about how he can't control what you do.", "NTA, and I think you should end your relationship.", "NTA\n\n\nFirst you told him, and he invalidated you.\n\n\nThen you reminded him, and there was physical evidence of your seriousness, and he blew you off again.\n\n\nThen he blew up at you for having told the truth.\n\n\nThen he told you to \"grow up\" (likely at high, sneering volume, in your own home) and called you a lazy bitch.\n\n\nYou're kind of an asshole to yourself for tolerating his entire act, and then still letting his contempt for you simmer in the place you earned your peace.\n\n\nIt must be a sign of how gradually he's broken you down, continually disbelieving you to your face, that it's even a question in your mind that you're in the wrong.\n\n\nHis remaining chore is packing and removing his stuff, his issues, and his person. He's revealed himself, and there's no coming back. One day you'll look back and cringe at when you tolerated that kind of disrespect anywhere, much less in your own home. Could be today.", "NTA\nSo he dismissed what you were saying multiple times and then got mad because that is what happened?\nHe sounds horrible. If he didn't dismiss what you were saying then you could have planned together and how to fix the issue, be it hiring extra help during that time, or doing minimal chores while you are busy, etc. But he didn't bother to discuss it with you cause he didn't believe you? What the hell?\n\nAnd then he got mad at you and called you horrible names. That's not ok. He does not sound like a pleasant guy.\n\nI don't think you are an asshole at all, you told him multiple times what was going to happen. He didn't take you seriously. That is on him. \n\nI don't think it's relevant, but what chores were not done because you were busy?", "NTA. File an eviction notice and kick him out. You told him ahead of time and he's acting like this. Get him out!", "That man is ridiculous, you are NTA. A good partner would step up and ask how they can help and make things easier he called you a bitch.", "I mean surely you don't have many chores if you are in your office all day!? If he is making mess why isn't he cleaning up after himself?! I can maybe understand dishes being a shared thing, but like in our house whoever makes dinner the other does dishes but that is dependant on both eating said dinner. I would honestly be rethinking this relationship especially after screaming outside your office.", "This isn't about the housework is it? He sounds horrible.", "NTA \n\nYou gave him plenty of warning, it\u2019s his fault for not listening/believing you.", "NTA.  You gave him warning, how much could you be contributing to the mess if you\u2019re working so much and you offered the compromise that you said you\u2019d do it when you could later in the month.\n\nRegardless, any reasonableness your BF had went out the window when he called you a bitch.  \n\nThis is a man who does not respect you", "Tell him to move out by the end of the week.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And in addition to your boyfriend being a jerk, and also doesn\u2019t seem very bright. Free rent and basically all entertainment coming out of your own budget as well? And all that isn\u2019t enough for him, because you should be cleaning up after him, too? Wow. And then to verbally lash out with profanity and screaming when you don\u2019t cave to his demands\u2026 that\u2019s unacceptable. Sounds like this dude has an unfillable, leaky cup, and nothing will ever be enough for him. If he can\u2019t increase his contribution for 2 months, even though that ultimately benefits HIM as much as you, his judgment is majorly impaired. He sounds like an immature dummy.

I hope you meant  EX boyfriend.", "Someone called me that and threw tantrum when I had explicitly told them what would happen, happened?

He will probably begin to hold you back and he will always have this hang up.", "NTA. Couples support each other. He\u2019s being a crybaby. He knew of your work commitment, and you could take up some extra in slack months to make it up. I\u2019d have said E S H, but his attitude tells me he\u2019s the one in the wrong here, completely. \n\nI work 4 days/week, my wife works 5. On my day off (Friday) I do the basic house cleaning and most laundry (she has some things that require special handling that I don\u2019t do). I\u2019m more of a clean-freak and did this when I was single before we met. She does groceries and cooking. When one of us has something come up, the other picks up the extra to help out.

As a person who has been married 10 years and with my husband for 14, we trade off covering for each other when we need it. Before we had kids housekeeping was really just going behind ourselves doing general upkeep. Then there was weekly bathroom cleaning and the floors. I don\u2019t understand how messy the house could be if you\u2019re occupied with work 85% of the time. That means the mess has to be coming from him.", "NTA\n\nHe screamed outside your door while you\u2019re trying to do the job that pays for the roof over his head. Speaking from experience, this gets worse not better. This is not one of these issues where he doesn\u2019t understand and if you just explain it a forth time, he\u2019ll suddenly respect you. He won\u2019t because that\u2019s not who he is and not who he wants to be. His behavior is reflective of who he chooses to be. Believe him.", "NTA. If you guys just moved in and he feels comfortable calling you a lazy B**** there's no future for you and him. He can't respect you in your own damn house, he doesn't even pay rent. Let him go and find someone else.", "NTA. Seems like its his mess, he can take of it. You gave him plenty of notice. He seems like a major AH tho\u2026", "NTA. He \u2018thought you weren\u2019t being serious\u2019, when by now if he\u2019s serious enough you (perhaps unwisely) moved him in, he should know how your life and work cycle works,called you a lazy bitch when you\u2019re working your ass off 12-18 hour days, and shouts outside your office door while you\u2019re working instead of cleaning up what you say in comments is predominantly his mess.   What exactly are his good points?", "NTA. Don\u2019t let any man call you a bitch unless he\u2019s already packed his bags and has a taxi waiting outside for him. Bye bye.", "NTA. My wife started a remote job recently and told me she would have to devote a lot of time to learning the job (she operates at either 100% or 0%). We had a discussion about what each of us were willing to give until she was comfortable and could resume normal contributions. We came to an agreement and life went on. \n\nYour husband dismissed your needs and your voice. It may be time to have a discussion about his behavior, not yours.", "NTA- relationships are give and take. You meal prepped for a few months worth of food and warned him multiple times this would happen. A normal, caring partner would see your workload and try to step up the amount they\u2019re doing to help out. After your stressful time, you would do something to help them out. It\u2019s about balance. \n\nIt looks to me like you do a full deep clean in January AND you then fund most everything the rest of the year on top of normal household duties. Am I also right in assuming you cook since you\u2019re the one who meal prepped for months of food? That seems more than fair. \n\nMy question to you to think about: if things were to go south in life and you needed help longer than 2 months, would this man stick around to help you and care about you? Think mental illness, physical injury, sickness, etc. Those things can and do last longer than what you\u2019re describing. Will he be there for you?", "NTA - you gave him plenty of warning and it was a condition when you moved in together. He didn\u2019t want to believe you. \n\nWe all make sacrifices in a relationship and through life. His reaction is not a good sign for your relationship in the future. \nIs he going to expect you to have a full time job, raise kids and take care of the house all on your own? Just because he thinks you can do it if you try enough?", "NTA. Not only did you give him plenty of warning you two have been dating long enough for him to be well aware that you pretty much drop off the face of the earth to pump out holiday orders. If he assumed you were exaggerating, that is on him, not you. \n\nDoes he have a day off any time soon? If so tell him you want him to come watch you for a few hours because while it may not work, him being your unobtrusive shadow might finally drive home how much work you are doing. Also feel free to include your post office run in his shadowing.", "NTA. And keep your workroom door locked. He may be the type that would go in and remove all your work things.", "NTA as you did set the boundaries from the get go but Y T A for staying with this dude. He expects you to clean the mess that he makes and he doesn\u2019t even pay rent.

November and December are my busiest time of the year when I make a lot of money that allows me to work less during the year. I\u2019ve been doing this since I was 25 so I\u2019ve got a decent idea of what I can and cannot do. And focusing on work only for 1-2 months is a sacrifice I\u2019m willing to make for chill rest of the year.\n\nThis year, I\u2019ve moved in with my boyfriend (m35). Well, technically he moved in with me because i own the house so it was a no brainier for him to move in with me.\n\nWe split chores half and half. He works full time (37.5 hours a week). When he moved in, I had a talk with him letting him know that I can\u2019t do any chores in November/December and asked if he could pick up the slack because I\u2019m physically unable to do any chores as I can be working anything  between 12-18 hours a day (I take a full January off to decompress). He said he doubted I worked that much but we will see.\n\nI asked again in September and October to make sure he was aware that I won\u2019t be doing anything (I meal prepped in advance) and I felt he kind of dismissed me.\nMid November, we had an argument about my chores not being done and I reminded him of what I told him.\n\nHe said that he thought I wasn\u2019t being serious and told me there\u2019s no way he\u2019d do 100% of chores because he\u2019s working too. I said fine, don\u2019t do my chores, they can wait until I have time. That\u2019s how it was when I lived alone, no problem, I don\u2019t make much mess anyway.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t happy but dropped it.\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen each other much because I\u2019ve been working so much but he\u2019s been more and more pissed off and blew up at me today regarding the chores.\n\nHe said I had to have a better work life balance and to grow up because the house was a mess. I told him if it was a mess it was his fault because I barely leave my office.\n\nHe called me a lazy bitch. I told him k didn\u2019t have time for arguing and went back working.\n\nHe stood in front of my locked office door shouting how he couldn\u2019t believe I was bei mg serious about not doing chores and it was an asshole move to leave it all to him.\n\nHe thinks I\u2019m a major asshole for basically disappearing for 2 months and following through with not doing chores. \n\nAm I really the asshole for saying I won\u2019t do chores and following through?\n\nSorry for any typos, I\u2019m on mobile and my autocorrect hates me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's not exactly fair that he picks up your slack for 2 months, workload or not. Can you hire help? He should have believed you and flying off the handle is completely beyond the pale.", "ESH.

He should have taken you seriously and insisted on a different solution instead of ignoring your warnings.", "ESH. You came to him all, \"I'm not going to do any chores for two months out of the year, you have to do everything,\" which tbh is ludicrous. Sorry, you do contribute to mess, unless you are literally pooping in a litterbox in your office, mopping yourself with baby wipes, never eating, etc. Humans contribute to mess. \n\nYou swooped in like his manager and gave a command, \"this is how it will go.\" He was stunned by your high-handedness, I would be, too, and that's likely why he thought you were exaggerating.\n\nYou're in a committed relationship now, you don't get to run the household by fiat. \n\nFor his part, he shouldn't have tuned you out and pitched a fit. He's worse than you are. \n\nSo y'all need to fix it if you want to keep this relationship. Or dump him, that's more than justified.\n\nSit down and figure it out.

It sounds like you tried your best to communicate that this was coming.\nThe idea of splitting responsibilities 50/50 in a relationship is great, but it\u2019s rarely realistic all of the time. \nWhen I was writing my thesis, my partner picked up way more than their share of the chores for a period of time because that\u2019s how a real partnership looks sometimes. \nI can see why some people wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who had this type of schedule for two months a year. But the way he\u2019s handling this is not appropriate. Calling you a lazy bitch is a one strike, you\u2019re out type of offence IMO.", "NTA - Seriously some major red flags here.

I know that if my partner called me a bitch, for no good reason, I would immediately end things.", "Big red flag. NTA. This guy gives me bad vibes.", "NTA, and holy cannoli with the marinara flags.   \nYou communicated with him repeatedly regarding what was to come, met with disbelief, and denial.

And the weather can do you dirty with the drop of a snowflake - or billions. \n\nYou gave him fair warning. You meal prepped. You contain your own foot print in your house.

You don't stop eating which makes dishes and/or trash even when everything is meal prepped, you still need to use the toilet and hopefully shower, your presence makes dust, etc. Just because you are okay with the level of mess you accumulate over two months doesn't mean that your partner needs to be, OR that they need to take on 100% of the chores for that time period. \n\nA *compromise* would have looked something like hiring someone to come clean for you during that busy time and/or picking up a larger share of the chores during your lesson busy time instead of splitting them 50/50.", "NTA.

HOWEVER, his way of dismissing you when you warned him and his behavior now that the reality has set in is ***not*** okay.\n\nYou need to consider if this is worth salvaging. If you decide it is then the two of you need to sit down at some point and talk about how you are going to handle next Nov and Dec. Could you afford someone to come in and help you those two months?

And just because you were fine with living in a messy house for a few months, you did that when you were alone and not living with someone.

People work and take care of their houses all the time. Hell, I worked 80 plus hours a week for a decade and, while my house was by no means perfect, I got things done.\n\nHis calling you a lazy B is unforgivable.

He makes a mess and expects to only clean up half of it.  \n\nOP is locked in her office for 60 days, has meals that can be popped in the oven, dishes in the dishwasher probably even runs it when it\u2019s full, does laundry as needed but probably wears the same clothes since she doesn\u2019t leave the office much, showers when needed.  With all this in mind that\u2019s not much of a mess.  Laundry would be the biggest thing but as a woman I have clothes that are deemed stay home clothes and I probably would only need to do laundry maybe twice in those 60 days if it was absolutely necessary.  When those 60 days are over and OP can breathe laundry gets done, the bathroom gets a deep clean, runs a vacuum in the office and does a full dust down of the house.  No problem!\n\nBF has to do his own laundry, clean his dishes or run the dishwasher if it\u2019s full, take out the trash while OP is in seclusion.  The problem os BF probably wants her to clean up his snacks he left all over the house, old pizza boxes, soda/beer cans, random trash, dishes that he used but didn\u2019t rinse off and put in the dishwasher so now they are rock solid with food scraps, picking up random clothing from all over the house.  I bet his friends have made comments about how the house looks when he has them over and he\u2019s embarrassed. Bet the friends make the comment that OP is just as messy as he is so he should be used to it.  BF probably figured splitting the chores 50/50 would work since he makes 90% of the mess.  \n\nHave a service come during your 60 days and have him pay 50% since he won\u2019t be doing his half of the chores when the service comes for 60 days.  If he doesn\u2019t like that idea have him move out and send him a bill for the service to come and clean up after he leaves because you know he\u2019s not cleaning that mess.

Although not directly related to this AITA, OP owns the house and BF doesn't pay rent. Fine.  They both split all bills, however OP said she pays for trips and meals out... not sure how that is splitting costs.  Also, it's not related to the AITA... and I feel too many are saying N T A simply because OP owns the home.\n\nBeing in a relationship and part of being an adult means cohabitation and being clean and sanitary.  BOTH parties have to contribute.  I can't understand how OP thinks that meal prepping for 2 months leaves no mess... like honestly, how does one survive on prepped food for 2 months?  Do you own an industrial freezer?  What does the BF eat for Nov and Dec?\n\nI also don't understand the comment about working for 12 or 18 hours a day without any free time.  Honestly, this isn't my life, but I know I've worked long work hours and still had \"free time\" to clean up after myself.  Any amount of work still leaves time for personal self care and you still need to shower, exercise and go outside for abit, or hang out with friends, or even watch TV/have screen time.\n\n Another item I struggle with is that OP only works 2 months a year, with a do nothing period in Jan. So in effect OP doesn't do any adult  related duties for 3 months.  OP didn't comment that during the rest of the year they pick up the slack and do more house work and chores.  This for me is the biggest obstacle.... if OP covered extra work for 9 months and then I'd be more reasonable to the 3 months off.\n\nAnyways, bad situation for both.

When a person works from home but their partner doesn\u2019t, the partner acts like the other person is not doing anything.

This may not be the issue with him, but since it's so common & he shares so many traits with men who have masculinity issues (being aggressive, insensitive & dismissive of you & your workload), it's definitely something you need to be aware of & watch out for.", "My husband and I are both messy.

So why doesn't he just hire a cleaner if it bothers him so much? I cannot believe the amount of abuse here.
