To be clear, I do not feel entitled to these things, but he wasn't contributing AT ALL financially.

The baby is due this month. They live in another state. I also have an issue with my step mom, who I view as selfish, lacking boundaries/ability to respect boundaries, and can never admit fault. She played a part in my dad leaving me and my sister at ages 8 and 5. She has treated me as less-than, many times.\n\nI feel that my dad is sending the message that me and my sister were not worth sticking around for, and that he'd just start a new family anyways, knowing that he'd be around even less for us. He knew she wanted kids and lied and said they'd never consider it. I feel SO bad because I know the baby didn't have a choice in being concieved, but I'm not comfortable being a part of their life.

Your Dad is the asshole from the sound of it. A parent is supposed to make sure their kid is provided for. My mother would work 3 hobs and skip out on meals so that I could eat. Whereas my deadbeat father was living the high life  on camping trips, going out buying vintage cars. Never had anything to do with me UNTIL he had to start paying child support. When that stopped, so did the visits. He went to have 3 other children all spoilt with things I never had. I don't want to associate with them at all they aren't my family. But he wants me to. So being the better person I bought them birthday presents and xmas presents. \n\nIt's not the baby's fault. Definitely your Dad's.", "NTA. You're never a butt hole for your feelings which are valid.", "NTA. Your dad and step mom are the gatekeepeers for anyone seeing the baby and you prefer to distance yourself from them for the reasons you mentioned. That is your personal choice and nobody else can take that choice away from you. But along with that means no relationship with the baby and as long as you feel justified in your choices, nobody has the right to criticize them. And you should not feel guilty.\n\nA lot of times when their is estrangement in a family one person does not fully know why the other person is not part of their life.  If your dad does not know, maybe writing a letter explaining your decision will explain it to him and give you some closure on this issue.", "NTA.  First off you are entitled to finacial support from your father while you were growing up.  Its called child support.  Sounds like he was a dead beat dad.", "While it's not the baby's fault, said baby comes with your Dad and stepmother, both of whom you prefer not to deal with. It is what it is.

So even if you do not want to associate yourself with the stepmother and the father, it'd be good if you sticked with your siblings. \n\n\nAnd since you're older you can be a positive model for it, so that it won't turn up being like the stepmother for example.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My grandfather has always been a selfish, cheating racist prick.

And he turned that kid even worse than him. Grandfather is the only great grandparent of my children still alive, but they've never met him cause everything revolves around him and his son.

It's one thing if they grew up together and act like real siblings, but if they don't, it's not the same as a full sibling. It's someone with another parent, another set on grandparents/cousins.", "YWBTA\n\nAs you stated, it's not the babies fault. Further, you have first-hand experience with how crappy the babies' parents will be. \n\nThere will be 21+ years between you and this sibling, you'll be more of an aunt. Nothing needs to be done all that soon. Visit occasionally starting by the toddler years. This is about building a relationship with the child, not babysitting for your dad or being forced to buy gifts. \n\nBe a friend, you know this kid is going to need some good people in their life.", "Unfortunately you can miss what you never had when dealing with messed up parents.

Never met mine, only spoke to her twice over the phone and all she had was demands. The first time she asked to meet me, but demanded I drive 2 hours to her home and wouldn\u2019t meet me halfway. Second time was to demand I pay her tuition because I have a good job.

It is a rollercoaster and tends to dredge up alot of childhood feelings. Take your time and remember to be kind to yourself during this time.\n\nI love my little brother more than life itself and have a decent relationship with him, but it doesn\u2019t mean that my relationship with said parent and stepmother has improved much.", "NTA", "At will presence\n\nNta\n\nJust cut him off", "For sure, OP is definitely NTA.
