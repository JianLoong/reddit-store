You are right: Lily will never become responsisible if people keep enabling her to live a certain way.", "NTA - And yes she gave up her right to be young and do whatever she wants when she had a child. She can still be young and have fun, permitted she can afford to and have proper babysitting, but not at everyone else's expense. Also like you said work from home doesn't mean that you have free time or a vacation. You are still working and can't take care of a young child while doing so. And even if you did really at the end of the day it's not your responsibility. You are also right the she's never going to grow up if everyone keeps enabling her. Stick to you guns. It is definitely your parent's responsibility (not saying that they should enable or change their minds) more so than it is yours, so why isn't your grandma attacking them instead of you?", "NTA. I think your parents are right that Lily needs to face reality sooner than later.... Obviously, you family members are still cognization of the situation and will intervene before any real harm comes to Thomas. But I would not be bailing her out with her problems till she wakes up and smells the roses and actually takes some steps towards responsibility.

As others have pointed out, the longer everyone enables her, the worse it\u2019s gonna get.", "NTA - as you said, she forfeited the right to the usual 20s life when she had a baby. You did not have a baby and are free to explore life as a childless 20s person. She doesn\u2019t seem to realize that WFH is still work. Her child is not in any way your responsibility. It seems like she has been spoiled and needs some tough love.", "NTA.

She thinks/believes she is owed something from the world.  Only when she loses this as her religion can she learn to be responsible for herself and the child she brought into the world.

I have to take those days off (my schedule is flexible so it works ok) \n\nThis is not on you.", "NTA this why my partner and I, as much as we want children, don't have them yet. Once they're here, they need to be a priority because they didn't choose to come into this world. I'm sure your sister would love the carefree years of her 20s but she does have a child who needs her. She's had help and plenty of notice. She needs to step up and be a parent, also maybe talk to baby's dad and see if she can get support there.", "NTA\n\nUnless your WFH job really is a paid vacation, you won't be able to WFH and watch a 2 year old at the same time. You'll fail at one or both, most likely. So unless she expects you to quit your job entirely, that's not an option.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister does not want to be a parent.

If you are working, you can't be caring for a child; at least one of those two things is going to suffer because you're trying to do both at once.", "NTA\n\nYour sister absolutely does not need more leisure time to get pregnant again.", "Exactly.\n\nYou stop getting to be a kid after you have a kid. \nLily needs to grow up and step up.", "Retail doesn't exclusively mean clothes- she could have had a job offer at ikea or a large mall that offers babysitting for shoppers.", "The only company I worked for (pre pandemic) that had a WFH policy enforced it pretty rigorously. To WFH you had to file a plan, and if you had kids, it had to include child care (or if kids were being looked after by someone else in the home, the worker had to have a space that was not open to  kids eg a home office.) \n\nThe employee manual said, very bluntly,  \"we are not paying you to take care of your kids. You are paid for working a specific schedule,  which includes billable hours, and during that time, we expect your undivided attention.\" They had to be hardass about it because billing for time was done on a  real-time basis and billing a client for time doing ANYTHING else could be considered fraud.  For our governmental clients it could even lead to criminal charges. They would be against the company,  not the employees,  but as one might imagine it was not a good idea to even open the door to that kind of thing. \nR\nIn reality, some supervisors were more chill and would look the other way if kids were occasionally not in childcare due to having sniffles or whatever. Some employees could flex their time to put in their non-billable hours when their kids were asleep,  but for others, the hours were fixed.\n\nIn general, people who abused WFH lost that privilege pretty quickly, especially if clients or other contacts could hear kid noise in the background.\n\nI heard that the rules got a little more flexible during COVID, but I had coworkers who were even fired for abusing WFH."]}
