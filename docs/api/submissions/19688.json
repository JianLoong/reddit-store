You are right: Lily will never become responsisible if people keep enabling her to live a certain way.", "NTA - And yes she gave up her right to be young and do whatever she wants when she had a child. She can still be young and have fun, permitted she can afford to and have proper babysitting, but not at everyone else's expense. Also like you said work from home doesn't mean that you have free time or a vacation. You are still working and can't take care of a young child while doing so. And even if you did really at the end of the day it's not your responsibility. You are also right the she's never going to grow up if everyone keeps enabling her. Stick to you guns. It is definitely your parent's responsibility (not saying that they should enable or change their minds) more so than it is yours, so why isn't your grandma attacking them instead of you?", "NTA. I think your parents are right that Lily needs to face reality sooner than later.... Obviously, you family members are still cognization of the situation and will intervene before any real harm comes to Thomas. But I would not be bailing her out with her problems till she wakes up and smells the roses and actually takes some steps towards responsibility. Has she just been begging family, or has she actually, say, researched local daycares?", "NTA! Paternal grandma is a piece of work. As others have pointed out, the longer everyone enables her, the worse it\u2019s gonna get.", "NTA - as you said, she forfeited the right to the usual 20s life when she had a baby. You did not have a baby and are free to explore life as a childless 20s person. She doesn\u2019t seem to realize that WFH is still work. Her child is not in any way your responsibility. It seems like she has been spoiled and needs some tough love.", "NTA. She's the one who decided to have a child and therefore she's the one responsible for meeting all of that child's needs and that includes childcare.", "If everyone is so concerned about the well being of the child, why isn\u2019t cps involved? Or if your friends are that concerned, why can\u2019t they help??", "NTA. She needs to take that job yesterday or get her own WFH job.", "NTA - Even if you were willing to do so it is not possible to work from home and take care of the kid at the same time.", "NTA\n\nThere is no solution for Lily except life.  She thinks/believes she is owed something from the world.  Only when she loses this as her religion can she learn to be responsible for herself and the child she brought into the world.  Oh btw:  WHERE is Thomas's father/family?  Lily has a history of bad choices and grandma just doesn't/can't see it (and if she could help probably would have a different opinion)", "NTA working from home is just that your working. Your not suppose to be chasing a toddler.\n\nLily is the adult she needs to figure it out. Her baby her responsibility.\n\nStop letting people guilt and manipulating you into taking care of your sister and her responsibilities. Lily needs a hard dose of reality.", "NTA \n\nShe decided to have a child. She has options. There is always private adoption if she does not want to parent.", "Nta. I'm truly sorry for the child but even if you really wanted to do this the vast majority of people (me included) find it impossible to do their jobs while watching a small child. I have to take those days off (my schedule is flexible so it works ok) \n\nThis is not on you.", "NTA this why my partner and I, as much as we want children, don't have them yet. Once they're here, they need to be a priority because they didn't choose to come into this world. I'm sure your sister would love the carefree years of her 20s but she does have a child who needs her. She's had help and plenty of notice. She needs to step up and be a parent, also maybe talk to baby's dad and see if she can get support there.", "NTA\n\nUnless your WFH job really is a paid vacation, you won't be able to WFH and watch a 2 year old at the same time. You'll fail at one or both, most likely. So unless she expects you to quit your job entirely, that's not an option.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister does not want to be a parent. At 2 she still has a bit of time to put the kid up for adoption and he won't remember too much.", "NTA\n\n\"so she begged me to return to working from home so that I could provide childcare for Thomas. I told Lily no.\" ... Really the only reasonable answer here. YOu need to focus on WORK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My paternal grandma called me a bad sister and aunt\" .. don't listen to that Ah, this is ridiculous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"A few of my friends told me I should be more concerned about Thomas and how my refusal to help will impact him.\" .. tell them THEY can help and babysit, or shut up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: Don't enable her, don't ruin your life for her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if you are concerned for Thomas, call CPS.", "NTA Lily will figure it out once she exhausts all other avenues of escape. If you cave now prepare to raise a child that isn't yours, as to grandma and friends just let them know you're sorry they feel that way and of course you'll be there for emergencies but raising your sister's child is not your job, it's your sister's.

Why hasnt anyone done anything.", "NTA - she had a child and not anyone else so it\u2019s her responsibility.  Your paternal grandmother is completely wrong that you have any responsibility to look after your adult sister. Your sister is an adult who had a child so should start behaving like an adult and take responsibility.

If there is a time that you deem reasonable (ie 2 weeks) for you to watch the baby while on the waitlist, do that.  (You are not obligated to do so, just a suggestion.)  If there are social services in your area that she hasn't taken advantage of, go with her if you want. Do not do anything FOR her.  You cannot want for people what they dont want for themselves.  She needs to decide for herself what she can and cannot handle.  Also, a note, she may make decisions you dont agree with. Hold your tongue unless the baby is in real danger.

How in the world are you suppose to do your job and take care of a 2 year old? Just because you work from home, your job is somehow vastly different than being in an office?
