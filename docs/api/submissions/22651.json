If your gf has been sick for a week & feeling worse maybe she needs to see a doctor. \n\nDid she expect you to just stare at her? I\u2019m not certain what she wanted you to do.

NTA\n\nShe's sick, she's not a baby that needs 24/7 supervision.", "are you an asshole for... answering a few texts while your girlfriend takes a covid test she said she didn't want any help with? no. NTA. are you not allowed to talk to anyone else because she's sick? she sounds crazy.", "NTA , Your GF reads as being very high maintenance", "NTA.\n\nSo does she just expect you to be her servant for a week?  Does she need constant attention while she waits the 15 minutes for the covid test results?\n\nI'd be happy to leave and not come back until she is healthy and rational", "INFO: How would she explain why she kicked you out?  If it was really just because you spent 2-3 minutes harmlessly answering a message from your brother and nothing else, that\u2019s so over the top ridiculous that I\u2019m surprised you need to ask here whether you might be TA.", "This is a relationship issue\n\nAnd how old are you two. You dont sound like teenagers but this doesnt sound like adults", "NTA.  Hopefully she is just out of character due to illness.  You are going above and beyond.   Risking your own health even. Do you think she\u2019ll care for you if you catch what she has?\n\nObviously if she kicked you out and is fine, she\u2019s not so deathly ill that she can\u2019t care for herself for 2 minutes", "Too high maintenance, I had COVID and I took the test alone, quarantined alone, etc... Sounds like she has to always be the center of attention. DTMFA and find a better GF.  NTA.", "NTA.\n\nWhat does she want/expect from you? Are you just supposed to sit there, and chant some weird thing, or perform some weird ritual, so the COVID test comes back negative? This girl sounds pretty self-absorbed and high-maintenance. I get the impression you could do better.", "NTA.

She sounds tiring to be round at the moment.", "NTA. She refuses your help and then blame you for not being here. I really do not get it... Any underlying issue? Did the test turn positive and that was her reaction?", "NTA. What more does she want from you?", "RED FLAG ALERT.  Take the hint and don't go back.  She sounds mighty needy.", "I fail to see how being kicked out of her place is a bad thing... you are finally free of her frankly immature behavior. She is a adult woman she do not need you to be completly at her call like some kind of slave... NTA and ask yourself if she would have helping you for a whole week if you were very sick", "NTA. She sounds incredibly needy, and was probably expecting you to grovel once she got mad. I\u2019d be having a serious talk with her about that behaviour.", "NTA\n\nGetting mad at you after she refused your help and then kicking you out after not giving her emotional support is immature.", "NTA, unless she's repeatedly asking you to do something, and you just keep using your phone, you did nothing wrong.", "She's TOXIC.", "NTA, she sounds childish.", "NTA. This is ridiculous.", "NTA. May be good to reflect on your relationship so you\u2019re not too codependent on each other", "NTA. Good luck with that one...", "Wow your gf sounds like a pain NTA and reconsider your relationship", "No, NTA. I hope you don't go back.\n\nBy no means do I endorse using the cell phone while you are in someone else's home, but this merited a very, very light boundary check.", "Oh hell no.

Second time was a couple month ago, and I'm still easily out of breath and exhausted altho all other symptoms are gone. Covid can be tough long term. So if her test was positive, could explain. If not, doctor indeed.", "Ffs I need emotional support to take a Covid test, this sh*t is horrible XD but doesn't justify kicking someone's out specially after refusing all support they proposed. Nta.", "Does she have access to health services on campus?", "Most university campuses have health services for students that provide basic care and pharmacy services.

She would get mad if I checked my phone while she was checking her phone, even if I started after her and finished first.\n\nShe's gotten way better at this since it was pointed out.

Your gf is a bit too needy if she freaks out over a 2-3 minute text. It's not normal to have to walk on eggshells to keep a gf from freaking out over texting your brother. Dump her, you're young.

Not everybody goes from having mommy or daddy take of their boo boos to expecting their spouse to take care of that role. It\u2019s a completely different thing how one comforts a sick child than how they should treat a sick adult. \n\nIt sounds like girlfriend still expects the kind of attention/pampering one gets from a parent. \n\nIs it nice to have friends/family/partners to look in on us and help us when sick? Of course! But adults should be appreciative and not ask for unreasonable accommodations. Needing to be babied is an unreasonable accommodation.", "NTA.  This is an entitlement issue.  I doubt it will get better, unfortunately.", "NTA, but your girlfriend is a childish one. \n\nShe wanted to take the test by herself\u2026 but she also needs emotional support to take it?
