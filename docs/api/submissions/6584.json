He fell apart.  I went to go live with my aunt because he was not doing well.  So I basically list both parents in one go.  He came to visit me every once in a while and after about two years he did come and get me.  He had met my stepmother and he wanted a family again.  I wish he hadn't.  \n\nMy stepmother isn't a terrible person.  She was actually pretty nice.  She didn't try and replace my mom.  And she was fair in how she dealt with myself and her daughter who was my age.  \n\nMy father however ove compensated a lot.  He would give my stepsister anything to try and win her over.  The year we turned 16 he bought us a car to share.  But she monopolized it and would only let me have it when her mom insisted I get a turn.  My dad would tell me to just let her have it.  \n\nI eventually just stopped using it at all.  I got scholarships and got out of the house as soon as I could.  When I graduated from college I approached my dad about getting the money my mom left me to put a downpayment on a house.  He told me that there was only like $5,000 left.  \n\nThis was really strange.  I did receive an allowance from my dad while I was at school.  It was great because it meant I didn't have to work.

And pay for the insurance on her car which it turns out he also bought out of that money.  \n\nI was, and honestly still am, furious.  I had him show me the account.  There was actually a little over $6,000 the n it.  I took it all.  I used it to get an apartment in town and neve went back to his house.  \n\nI have done well since and finally own my own home.  I am married to an amazing woman and we are building a great life together.  \n\nMy stepsister on the other hand is kind of a screw up.  She was recently arrested for drunk driving again. So her trial is coming up and if she completes an inpatient treatment for her alcoholism she may get probation rather than incarceration.   \n\nMy dad doesn't have any money to help her. She doesn't have any money either.  So my dad approached me.  I said no thank you.  He said if I didn't help her then he would have to mortgage my childhood home.  So I told him that he could have all the money my mom left for me.  \n\nHe is mad at me and says that I don't understand what he went through to get where he is.  \n\nI told him that neither him or the kid he sucked up to with my money were my problem.  \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit. \n\nI'm not looking for validation.

Not because you did anything wrong, but because you're using muscles you never used before. It takes practice to get to the point where you can be comfortable prioritizing yourself without being like \"Wait am I being selfish?\".
