My dad would tell me to just let her have it.  \n\nI eventually just stopped using it at all.  I got scholarships and got out of the house as soon as I could.

She doesn't have any money either.  So my dad approached me.  I said no thank you.  He said if I didn't help her then he would have to mortgage my childhood home.

Not because you did anything wrong, but because you're using muscles you never used before. It takes practice to get to the point where you can be comfortable prioritizing yourself without being like \"Wait am I being selfish?\".
