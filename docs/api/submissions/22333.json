I\u2019m not feeling so good so I went for a nap at 5pm. My husband said he might join me soon as he was also tired. \n\nAt 7pm I woke up from my nap to find my husband coming in the room to nap. I asked him how long he wanted to sleep for and he said about an hour, maybe more. Whenever he says this it\u2019s more like 2 hours and it\u2019s very hard to wake him. I said \u201cwhat about dinner? I\u2019m hungry and you said you were going to make something special\u201d. He said \u201cwell I\u2019m tired, I\u2019ll make it later.\u201d I pushed and said I don\u2019t want to have dinner at 11pm, it\u2019s an elaborate meal so either he can sleep now and we just order in or he can cook and I\u2019ll help. \n\nHe said I\u2019m being selfish for telling him he can\u2019t nap, and I need to be more flexible and eat late, he didn\u2019t want me to order in or make my own dinner while he was asleep. All I\u2019ve eaten today is a bowl of cereal at 12pm. It\u2019s now 8.15pm, I\u2019m starving and he\u2019s asked me to leave him to make dinner on his own and is clearly mad at me. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA: people seem to be missing the point I made about not wanting to eat dinner at 11pm, we usually eat at 6-8pm at the latest. Yeah I could\u2019ve had a snack or made myself dinner but he was insisting to get up at 9pm and start cooking the same meal. If I\u2019d let him nap I\u2019d have to eat dinner at 11pm which would upset my stomach.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nJust thought I\u2019d add an update, he got up and cooked because he didn\u2019t want me to order in. We ate, we\u2019re fine, he kind of understood why I was pissed and said he agrees we shouldn\u2019t be eating so late.

Piss poor time management on his end and he should have just been honest and said he didn\u2019t feel like cooking anymore. I would have ordered or made myself what ever I wanted and made a night of it.\n\nTo people calling you selfish eff them. You were promised a nice meal that you didn\u2019t have to cook you were clearly excited for it and ended up disappointed because your husband who you trust to follow through let you down.

I say NTA because you did offer to order food if he wanted to take a late nap.

He wants to sleep in a way that makes it so you can't eat dinner until late, and you don't want that (and who does). \n\nIf, when you had asked about dinner, he had said \"sorry, let's raincheck that dinner and just eat separately\" then I'd say N A H, because of course he can change his mind about cooking or when he wants to eat versus when you do. But he won't change the plan when he also had hours to nap and should have an idea of when a reasonable dinner time is. You gave him options that included him napping, but he is insistent that it be only HIS way and you be \"flexible\" when you don't need to be. You can eat when you are hungry, just like he can nap when he is tired. \n\nSo just make yourself dinner. Eat whatever you want and when he gets up, he can make himself food. Done.", "NTA.

If he wanted to cook a special dinner that wouldn\u2019t be ready until 5 hours past when you expect to eat, he should\u2019ve told you that. A 2 hour nap at 7 is also unusual unless you are on a weird sleep schedule (sometimes with babies and on call jobs, you sleep whenever and wherever you can.)

You didn\u2019t deny him a nap. You simply denied his nap + eating dinner four hours late. What the heck was he doing for two hours??  And some folks are saying that your decision to only eat cereal is your fault and you should just snack. You made that decision rightfully assuming you would be eating dinner around 7. You have every right to want dinner at a reasonable time instead of snacking. And you provided an alternative of ordering take out so it\u2019s not like you forced him to cook. And he wanted you two to eat together so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re just helpless and can\u2019t/won\u2019t feed yourself.

I know I make dinner every night and jump at the chance when my husband offers to cook.  I would be relieved at first, take that nap and then not be mad but disappointed because I would feel like he promised something and was not following through.  So I feel like your emotions make sense because I would feel that way as well.  \n\nI would let him nap and take care of myself for dinner that night.  If he still wants to cook when he gets up he can.  But you had the conversation of not wanting to wait till 11pm to eat and he chose to nap after you expressed your concerns.  \n\nNone of this sounded like a fight to me, just normal every day married life of figuring out dinner and who has offered to do it.  He's not really the a-hole either though... but I know I would be disappointed.  \n\nSorry, I know that is a lot to say I understand your emotions in this situation.

You don't get to have someone make you a special meal and dictate when it's made and if he can sleep first. Yta.\n\nI truly don't believe that you would get an upset stomach from eating late.

He chose not to make the dinner he promised before late napping knowing that eating late upsets your stomach (which is a punishment & not something nice imo). Now he can accept the consequences & make his special dinner tomorrow at a reasonable hour if he truly wants to do something nice for you & not just himself. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with him napping if he's tired.

Here\u2019s the thing:  he can want all the things but that doesn\u2019t mean he gets them.  If he wants to sleep, he doesn\u2019t get the right to tell you to wait until he\u2019s up to eat.  I wouldn\u2019t even entertain this bullshit.  \n\nHe could have slept and you could have eaten while he slept.  It shouldn\u2019t even be something to bicker about.

The important thing for me is that your husband made a promise. You're not unreasonable for expecting him to keep it.

You were promised a meal and you eat at specific times. He was procrastinating and now you won\u2019t eat until late. Order in anyway then have his meal as a late night meal. I feel your frustration because my husband will do this kind of thing to me and it\u2019s super irritating.", "NTA but this is weird.

What an incredibly strange set of things to fight about.", "You do realize that you don\u2019t have to comply with what he\u2019s asking, right? I understand not wanting to upset your spouse, but it\u2019s pretty unreasonable for him to ask you to skip dinner while you\u2019re hungry and he naps. If you are hungry, just eat dinner.

He can be mad and you can be full.", "You could have literally just ordered takeout and eaten it while he was napping, and then told him when he woke up. Like you said, you shouldn't be with a person if you have to hide stuff from him. \n\nYou should have eaten, and then when he woke up upset you should have expressed your upset at the situation and how hungry you were and needed to eat. If he's upset with that, then there's a problem. It truly sounds like the root of the problem is a fear of confrontation because you absolutely could have eaten while he was not awake. There was nothing stopping you other than yourself. \nAnd if HE had stopped you from eating, then he has bigger problems than food, honestly.", "You said husband, which means you two are grown adults who can make your own personal choices.

OP has been asked *repeatedly* on this thread \u201cwhat will happen if you eat without him,\u201d and she has not indicated physical *or* verbal abuse.  She said he would have been angry.\n\nSurely you know that people in relationships can get angry with one another without being abusive.  And I hope you understand that both parties can actually be engaged in a passive-aggressive battle, and that the loudest person is not always the winner or the abuser.\n\nSo, feel free to step down off of your moral highground.  OP is not sharing anything that indicates she is abused.  She does, however, seem to be engaged in a back and forth with an *equally* unreasonable partner.\n\nNarcissists and passive-aggressive men *and* women get away with their bullshit by relying on people to overlook their passive-aggressive and intentionally provocative low-key actions.
