This was despite the fact that we were now in our thirties, so we weren\u2019t exactly students anymore.\n\nSo that kind of hurt, but whatever, I respected his decision and left him alone.

If he wants to forget those years and move on then respect it. \n\nLater on when you and your fellow coworkers go to the bar you buy a round for everyone BUT him.

You got petty acted like college kid again. You got a free pass as it was a minor slight in the grand scheme of things but he was right. What you did was a dick move.

That's some mean girl shit right there.\n\nThe offer to buy a round is the same rule, like if I go out after work and my disliked coworker is there I'm still buying her a round if it's a group offer. It would be very nasty to exclude her in addition to just being a bad look.\n\nYou're telling it like it was you with some long standing friends being barged in and interrupted. That's not the case though and I think your behavior was needlessly unkind and petty.\n\nThis guy had bad experiences at that time in his life, enough that he wants to distance himself and said as much. I don't think those feelings are all that invalid for a lot of people, like there is a phase in my life I have no desire to see people from again. It doesn't mean I want to be so stuck in that feeling that I can't go out and be social and enjoy the new things in my life. \n\nFor you to punch back and play kiss the ring when the social paradigm of what you're describing is its an open invitation then kick the guy out is ah behavior.

Did he? What made you think he expected a drink from you?", "You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions here. Your feelings were hurt so you told him hey I\u2019m not buying you a beer when he may have not wanted you to buy him a beer. Ehhh", "How hard would it be for OP to ignore his \"friend\" and just go about socializing.  Or even, I don't know, trying to mend the fence.  I feel like OP was gaslighting this \"friend\" of his by inviting everyone out and then publicly shaming him.\n\nDefinitely bully material.", "How can he tell OP he doesn't want to interact with him and also hang out with his coworkers that include OP? Those are conflicting.", "Your reading comprehension is shit huh, they were people OP met at a volunteer event and the group went to a pub together after, then this dude just sits at their table", "Exactly my thoughts", "Could you C&P the part where OP \"declared an entire pub off limits to someone\", please? I've read the post  a few times and I still can't find it.", "Oh please. The word enemy isn\u2019t exclusive to literal warfare.", "NTA - I guess that u/roymondous just likes to argue, because I certainly think that he made it clear that he didn't want anything to do with you, even if it wasn't just you.", "\u2018I want nothing to do with you, and I am going to pretend not to know you\u2019\n\nThis isn\u2019t in the OP. Did he word for word say this? Cos your OP was general for everyone at school.\n\n\u2018How did I publicly humiliate him?\u2019\n\nWow this is a weird twisting of logic and victim blaming. You cannot publicly shame the dude by telling him to leave in front of everybody and then shit on the dude when he\u2019s gone to everyone else to explain your actions and not say you did not publicly humiliate him. Did you politely request he leave? Did you kindly explain the situation to the others and not shit on the dude afterwards? The only question is whether this assholery was justified\u2026 and so far, absolutely not. This could all have been done privately. You *chose* to make it publicly.\n\nJust as you repeatedly choose to ignore whether the complaint was made before or after you did this to him.", "I did no such thing. Minor speculation and that is it.", "OP openly told everyone he worked with they were getting a free drink but the other guy in the story. That is one hell of a thing to do. Just creates drama where none is needed. Some folks are putting an immense amout of effort to ignore OP's actions.", "Right, like people never have private struggles with drugs or alcohol or mental illness that was not properly under treatment. No one has ever behaved in a way that causes embarrassment or shame or brings them back to place they never want to be again and even their association causes them pain.\n\nAnd the whole he made it up? That's an odd assessment of the situation from 9 minutes? Of interaction.\n\nI no shit worked with a gal with prominent self harm scars who had a full blown 911 level panic attack from seeing a FRIEND of her childhood bully. People carry things and scars we don't see or appreciate. It would have cost you nothing more than a beer to be nice and be gracious.\n\nYou seem hellbent on hearing you're not the AH. You certainly won't hear it from me but I just hope the guy didn't have some internal dialogue of ok maybe it was hard then but OP wasn't a dick so... \n\nAnd if this is this guy's place of employment I think it would be a HUGE AH move to continue to volunteer there. You don't have to be there, stakes are next to 0 for you but it's his livelihood.", "I think they're saying *he* tried to get *you* kicked out by snitching", "It was the group at orientation, so he was likely there for the same reason the OP was. To socialize with the group. You can socialize without a drink, or he could have bought his own.", "Why would that even matter. I wouldn't want someone who was so rude to come and sit with me.\n\nThe guy made it pretty clear he didn't want anything to do with OP so he can find somewhere else to sit.", "Dude literally told the event coordinator he's not a team player over it, he wanted the free drink", "Him: \"I want to move on from what I did in school, I don't want to deal with the baggage. I have a career and I want to focus on that. So I don't know you.\"\n\nMe: \"But you do know me.\"\n\nHim: \"Yes, but I don't know you.\"\n\n>Just as you repeatedly choose to ignore whether the complaint was made before or after you did this to him.\n\nWhy are you obsessed with this point? Of course he complained after, why would he complain before?\n\nEdit: You blocked me because you can't deal with the fact a guy you don't know is  irrational? You're a complicated person, I'll leave it at that.", "The other guy wasn't there when he made the offer.  He wasn't part of the original group, and why would he be since he wants nothing to do with anybody he went to college with, unless, apparently, he can get a free drink?  He should have at least asked if it was o.k. if he joined them.", "No", ">A couple hours later when we were all done I had met a few people who were actually sociable and we decided to go across the street to a pub. I was in a good mood and told them the first round was on me because I had a good day.\n\n>So we go over to the pub and that guy shows up and sits down at the table.\n\nI think you read the post wrong or something.", "So you make a habit of demanding people GTFO in *group settings* because they were mildly rude to you *one time*? That's honestly ridiculous behaviour.\n\nThis was a volunteer joining a group of fellow volunteers from the same organization for a drink at the pub. Unless OP had a clear reason to believe the guy expected a free drink, he was being pretty aggressive IMO.", "Also not what was in the OP. In OP, it was general. You decided to take that personally and continue to interpret it quite differently. \n\nWhy am I \u2018obsessed\u2019? Cos you ignoring that point clearly means something was off. And the way you presented it *again* twisted things. So he complained after you publicly humiliated him in front of other people. Sounds fair. You know exactly what you\u2019re doing by twisting things so others go to your side. This appears to be a theme for you. \n\nOverall. Something went down at school. And there is a whole lot more to the story than your side of things. That you felt entitled to publicly humiliate someone because of this means you behaved like an asshole. Don\u2019t buy the guy a drink? Sure. Tell the guy to fuck off in front of everyone? No. Asshole. \n\nFor future reference the more human thing to do next time would be to talk to him privately asking why he joined the table then and what was up. \n\nI won\u2019t debate this anymore. This is a vote thing. And my vote is based on the OP and based on the twisting of things here in comments. Even here, you are changing the story repeatedly to suit your needs of looking like the good guy. You behaved like an asshole. What is unclear is if the other guy did as well. \n\nGoodbye.", "Touch\u00e9\n\nBut he also claim the guy wasn\u2019t around the group so again he wouldn\u2019t have known", "You\n\n>So you make a habit of demanding people GTFO in group settings because they were mildly rude to you one time?\n\n\n\nOp\n>I asked what are you doing here, I\u2019m not buying you a drink. You don't know me.\n\n\n\nBut go off", "We found the guy!", "Ew. Condescending much?", "I think it's a good thing that you are giving up, because you are making no sense.  I don't see that OP was twisting things.  You're just inventing the idea that \"Something went down at school.\"  So, if OP asked the other to step aside, and quietly told him to leave, no-one else would have thought that anything was odd?/s. The guy sat himself down at a table without being invited or asking permission, after he told the guy who was buying the drinks that he didn't want to see anyone that he knew from school.  I'd say that was sadly lacking in manners.", "Found the guy who wanted a free drink lol", "No, but he walked into the pub and saw a group of people sitting at a table - OP, and the rest who didn't know the man. He chose to just sit down instead of like, I don't know... asking if it was alright if he joined. \n\nWhile OP didn't necessarily have to say what he did, there wasn't anything inherently wrong here. Why should somebody have to share a table with someone who, just earlier that day, claimed he didn't want to know him or be associated with someone he went to school with? \n\nBecause manners? How about no.", "Wow, I slightly exaggerated, sue me. Asking someone \"What are you doing here?\" in a group setting is aggressive as fuck.\n\nIf the guy went expecting a free drink, fine. If not, OP was a dick.\n\nNotably, OP has ignored multipe questions asking for clarification on that matter.", "Always when people try to paint themselves in a good light by leaving out information", "\u2026 they did know him. They\u2019re coworkers. By OPs own admission no one else had issue with him\n\nYou can be civil with people who don\u2019t want to be your besties. It\u2019s called being an adult", "Have you read his other comments...?"]}
