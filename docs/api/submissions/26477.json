I 100% know the guy.\n\nI went over to say hi and he was sort of evasive about saying anything to me. I was initially confused because I thought we were on good terms. When I said, \u201chey man, it\u2019s me from school\u201d he said he knew who I was, but apparently once graduation was done he decided to \u201cmove on\u201d from school and be done with it. He told me he wanted to deal with adults and wanted nothing to do with people he went to school with. This was despite the fact that we were now in our thirties, so we weren\u2019t exactly students anymore.\n\nSo that kind of hurt, but whatever, I respected his decision and left him alone.

If he wants to forget those years and move on then respect it. \n\nLater on when you and your fellow coworkers go to the bar you buy a round for everyone BUT him.

You got petty acted like college kid again. You got a free pass as it was a minor slight in the grand scheme of things but he was right. What you did was a dick move.

That's some mean girl shit right there.\n\nThe offer to buy a round is the same rule, like if I go out after work and my disliked coworker is there I'm still buying her a round if it's a group offer. It would be very nasty to exclude her in addition to just being a bad look.\n\nYou're telling it like it was you with some long standing friends being barged in and interrupted. That's not the case though and I think your behavior was needlessly unkind and petty.\n\nThis guy had bad experiences at that time in his life, enough that he wants to distance himself and said as much. I don't think those feelings are all that invalid for a lot of people, like there is a phase in my life I have no desire to see people from again. It doesn't mean I want to be so stuck in that feeling that I can't go out and be social and enjoy the new things in my life. \n\nFor you to punch back and play kiss the ring when the social paradigm of what you're describing is its an open invitation then kick the guy out is ah behavior.

I don't think he ever anticipated running into someone out in the wild and having to actually deal with it.", "He wanted to sit there because the other coworkers were there. He shouldn\u2019t be completely outcast from everyone just because he doesn\u2019t like one person. \n\nWell I assume he didn\u2019t want to be friendly with OP because OP is the 30 year old man who declared an entire pub off limits to someone who didn\u2019t want to be their friend. Likely a personality trait OP has been carrying since college when the guy knew him", "I'm not sure, but I can't think of any other reason he would just happen to go to the pub with them and sit at their table. If he didn't know about the drink he also wouldn't have known they were going to the pub, surely. Seems like a hell of a coincidence to me, I guess.", "Never heard of rounding I guess, have you?", "Oh, in an edit, lol", "NTA for not buying him a drink...\n\nBut you might have been the AH for telling him to leave the table... don't think you've provided enough detail, context, nuance, etc.. someone may have invited him who hadn't shown up yet, or maybe just passed on the word that some people were going to the pub...\n\nYou don't owe him a drink, but sounds like you went too far not letting him hang out with the group...", "1) so you don\u2019t know if anyone else invited him \n2) you had to explain to them why he wasn\u2019t allowed. Meaning everyone else was fine with it \n3) who cares he doesn\u2019t want to be your bestie. It was a decade ago\n\n4) your a grown ass adult. Even if everything went down like you said it did you still acted like a child", "Honestly, be the bigger person. You are volunteering with the aim of helping students. Presumably so is he. You knew you would continue to see him while you were volunteering. There were many more mature ways to handle this without being a doormat and without coming off as a jerk to other people who might otherwise only have this incident to judge you on.", "Lol. My entitlement to what? Respond to a post asking for opinions?", "He didn\u2019t decide to buy a round until after they were at the pub. The guy just sat at a table full of his coworkers", "Strong disagree. Even if you were in class with someone all day (but not talking to or interacting with them at all, as in this case) you *ask* before sitting down at their table. \"Hey folks! Mind if I join you?\" \"Hey! Steve said you were heading over here. He's should be along in a couple minutes. Is it alright if I pull up a chair?\" \n\nYou don't just plop yourself down without so much as a by-your-leave. I'm an autistic who sometimes still has the emotional intelligence of a mashed potato, and I still know that!", "How is telling a grown adult who told you they wanted nothing to do with you for absolutely arbitrary reasons that you won't buy them a drink childish?", "Bigger person? He told me he wanted nothing to do with me. Why on earth would I want to appease someone like that?", "You think OP apparently owed him a space at the table. He did not.", "That\u2019s not what you said though \u201cwhat the hell are you doing here!\u201d isn\u2019t simply not buying someone a drink \n\nNow share with the group. Did your wife suggest volunteering so you could make friends?", "If that\u2019s how you truly feel, why are you asking if you were the asshole to kick him off the table?"]}
