I believe that someone being associated with a friend doesn\u2019t automatically make them a friend in turn. I prefer gradually growing comfortable with new people and eventually becoming friends. \n\n2) This might make me the AH because they want to be friends with me, can seem like I don\u2019t accept them being partners with my friend, or dislike them altogether.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you don\u2019t want sally, and other friends S/O are planning to go, either make it a guys trip or deal with Sally. I think it\u2019s valid to not want to be trapped in a car for hours on the off chance you and her don\u2019t get a long. But that\u2019s the other beauty of it\u2026 you\u2019re not the one dating her. But it\u2019s also valid for George and Sally to want to both be included in the friend group and activities.
