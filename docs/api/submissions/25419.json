He should\u2019ve accepted your first answer.", "Your car, your rules.  I wouldn\u2019t go on a road trip in your car, though, too much stress!\n\nWhen my kids were small, we had a strict rule. Rest stops, adults sat at a preferably picnic table, and ate, kids\u2019 food stayed in the bags, while the kids raced around. We picked where we sat so kids *could* run around.  Jumping jacks and other exercises if necessary, depending on venue.  But, they needed the gross motor activity.  Then, back in the car, hand out the kids\u2019 food.   Seriously, I wasn\u2019t wasting any stopped time out of the car with the kids holding still!  Kids eat in the car!  \n\nHowever, OP, you do you!", "NAH I don't think you're necessarily an AH but I personally wouldn't enjoy hanging out with you. I can see why the friend didn't vibe with your uptightness. I think it's fine to have your rules but appreciate it may isolate you from people who are not so anal.", "We tried the no eating in our car.until we had to make it from Wisconsin to Florida in 24 hours and I have to eat 6 times a day(I don't really eat meals 6 times a day. I snack then eat dinner) because of the medication I take.", "NTA. I occasionally eat in my car but I don't make a habit out of it. I like my car to smell nice and food inside defeats that,  especially McDonald's. Your car, your rules. If you went thru the drive thru there might be an argument, but eating inside a restaurant is totally reasonable", "NTA it is a new car, it is your rule, you as the driver needed to eat safely without driving, you had an available table.  Let him be mad.  When he has a new car he will feel the same.  We just got a new vehicle after having my last one for 15 years.  My biggest rule was we are not eating in the new vehicle especially because when we did in the past my kids would drop food and we had grease stains all over the carpets that I never could get out.  This new vehicle cost way too much to have it ruined by food.  So never again.  Now if you had no other option of where to eat and it was raining out I might make an exception but there was a table and you were able to eat and get back on the road.", "NTA. Your car, your rules.", "It's your car, your rules. But I don't like smells so I don't like eating in car for that reason. My car isn't even brand new! I understand your stance. NTA.", "I had a client that i didn't care if she ate in my old Honda. I gave her a couple of chances when i got my brand new car. She effed up twice and got chocolate stains on my seats. I told her afterward that she was no longer allowed to eat in my car. She freaked out on me but i stayed true. \n\nNTA. You have the right to keep your new car clean.", "NTA you guys could have gone to a public park or somewhere else to eat instead of the crowded restaurant as well instead of your car. Let him be mad.", "You are stupid for even asking reddit. Obviously NTA.", "Nta. \n\nYour car your rules. It doesnt matter if its new or not.\n\nI would have told him to stop being snobby and eat inside lol", "NTA, even if previous cars didn't have the rule. Some stains can't be detailed away.

Plus since you're going camping, you don't want any chunks of food in your car depending on the type of wildlife in the area. \n\nI'm taking my daughter on a trip in the Adirondack Mountains (upstate NY) next week & while we aren't camping, my reservation email from the lodge we're staying at literally has all these disclosures I have to sign upon arrival that they are not responsible for bears or any other wildlife damage to yourself or personal property.

Your car, your rules.", "I mean he can have opions on it but its your car and you have every right to set those rules. He can get another ride if its a big problem.\nAs long as he has enough chance to eat and drink outside of the car it should be fine. Its a bit unfair if you wont stop for people to eat and drink but other than that its totally fine.\n\nI hate crowded places inside, too much noise but i have no problem eating standing or having a little picknick next to the car. Same with stuff like music volume and smoking thats up to the driver/ owner of the car.", "Nta your car your rules. \n\nNext time you'll be road tripping in your car, you should let people know your rules beforehand. This will give them the opportunity to drive their car.", "NTA\n\nBut consider you might be able to prevent this kind of thing by discussing it before you decide where to stop for a lunch break so everyone knows what\u2019s coming and you can pick a spot together where everyone is reasonably comfortable.", "If he was petty enough to let that ruin the rest of your trip I would rethink being friends with him. Nta", "I don't have food in the car no no no nta", "NTA. Your car your rules. I ask everyone who comes into my house to remove their shoes.

That should've met both of their criteria.", "i don\u2019t think dude even really had a problem that there was alot of people it reallyyy sounds like he jus wanted to get his way with it", "This. Something I've realized as I get older....people don't like being told no, even if it's over something trivial.", "And some people don't feel comfortable eating in their car. The friend could have eaten his food in the parking lot if he is so socially inept that he cannot eat at a table inside a restaurant because there are other people around.", "I have that same rule for my car. If you are smoking, you aren't getting in.", "I've never been too bothered about eating in the car and mess, unless I've just cleaned it recently. I'd only had my car a couple weeks when I went on a trip and there was someone with me and friend also on this trip who we'd never met but needed transport and lived near me so we arranged beforehand. Anyway we stopped for snacks/toilet break and then sat in the car eating before I would drive again. The new friend was literally hanging out the car and I questioned him, he was like 'the car is clean and I may make mess' and my friend literally laughed and told him he should have seen my last car and how it's only clean because it's new.

I\u2019ve nearly fainted while driving less than an hour away once. I will not ever plan a drive longer than that without at least SOMETHING with me in case I start seeing stars and need to stay conscious long enough to pull off somewhere safe. \n\nBut I\u2019m also super particular about who I let drive me so I\u2019m almost always the driver. Thus I can eat as many granola bars and drink as much Gatorade as my heart desires lmao", "From what they said it seems like he doesn't value other people's property. When OP said they didn't want to ruin their new car he should've stopped right there. Like I said I'm a car guy and could be biased but to other people a car is just a car and they have no sentiment to one.", "To be fair he said he wanted to eat in the car, not necessarily while moving.

It's been 3.5 years get over it.", "For me it depends on *how* a person vapes. It seems like people with rigs like to hit that shit hard and everyone in a 15 foot radius can smell and see it. I also know a few that smoke on those little sticks and take small poofs, which I don't mind in a car at all because frankly if they're in the backseat I can't even tell unless they're blowing it up towards me. Smell doesn't stick with vape either.", "that mcdonalds got AC in it no point to eat outside", "I wear shoes inside cause my feet hurt if I walk around barefoot. Plantar fasciitis.

It means he/she doesn\u2019t want someone dropping food all over, using the seat as a napkin and spilling shit in their brand new car. Their friend sounds rude af. Toddlers have better manners when eating in the car than OPs friend does. It\u2019s ridiculous that OP had to point it out in the first place. Don\u2019t get me started on how the friend tried to argue against it.

The juuls werent even that bad but the new elf bars and such smell SO BAD!!", "Yk I personally can\u2019t smell it when I\u2019m vaping but my girlfriend can tell what juice it is just by the smell haha.
