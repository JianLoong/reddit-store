We went to a small mall, half the day on the bench. It was window shopping.\n\nShe is obese, her ankles are swollen from her weight. The connection between her weight and not walking far without a break is very obvious.\n\nPost:\n\nI will try to keep this short. I have three girls and we still like to do girl trips for the day. My son got married to a girl named Beth. Now before her first kids she was average weight and after it got a lot worse. Her only kid is 8 years old at this point and she hasn\u2019t lost the weight. It\u2019s bad enough that she needs constant breaks walking. \n\nI used to like her and now I don\u2019t due to how she acts. Everywhere we go with her it is constant complaining that she is tired. The last girls trip to the mall was spent sitting on a bench half the day since she needed constant break. If you try to leave she will go on about abandoning her. It\u2019s annoying.\n\nI invited the girls to go to a farm for pumpkin patch and pick some apples. It has big orchards and a ton of walking. We went it was a great time and some pictures went on Facebook. I got a call from Beth asking why she wasn\u2019t invited. I lied saying it was just a family trip and she accused me of lying.\n\nI had enough and told her the truth. I told her she wasn\u2019t invited due her weight. That she forces us to stop all the time and it ruins the trips most days since we don\u2019t get to do half the stuff. She called me a jerk and hung up.\n\nI am getting texts from my som saying to apologize but the girls are on my side and are sick of having trips ruined since we have to wait for her all the time.", "created_utc": 1696857401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173rk9a/aita_for_telling_my_dil_she_wasnt_invited_due_to/", "score": 6857, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nope. I can understand your response.\n\nNTA \u2014 Beth pushed too hard so you pushed back. That\u2019s on Beth. Beth was trying to guilt you. \n\nETA \u2014 about the lying \u2026. If you boldly ask someone why you were not invited to go apple picking or anyplace else in the world \u2026. Chances are very good that it\u2019s not going to be for magical & wonderful reasons \u2026 the honest answer will always be because we did not want to include you. Best not to ask the question or push too far. Just accept the kind answer.", "I\u2019m not as small as I used to be. If I know there is a lot of walking in an activity I am being invited on\u2026I decline and say you know my knees are just not up to it. She needs to use her own common sense. MIL calls and invites her to do a 5 mile hike\u2026she knows she can\u2019t do it\u2026say maybe next time we can do something. MIL calls and says we are going to the mall for lunch and window shop. Say sure that\u2019s great I will join you for lunch and then leave\u2026you know I\u2019m not much for walking the mall.", "NTA. There needs to be balance. Beth needs to bow out of things that too physically taxing for her, use mobility aids so that she doesn't hold up the entire group and not complain when others opt not to spend most of the activity time waiting on her.\n\nWhen you do include her on things, hopefully you choose things that don't require much walking and when you do need to leave her, don't cave to her whining. Tell her you love her and you'll meet back up in 20 minutes or rotate who gets to sit with her. \n\nI think her attitude more than her weight is going to keep her excluded. And I hope her 8 year old isn't being left out too.", "\"are sick of having trips ruined since we have to wait for her all the time.\"\n\nAt the risk of being called fatphobic, good for you.  **NTA**\n\nWhy should your trips revolve around her?  ***Why should you be forced to plan outings  that are within your DIL's step limit?***  Finally, you're free to only invite your actual daughters to things, too.\n\nYou aren't blocking her from any and all family gatherings.  She just got blocked from this one, which I hope is the first of many trips you and your daughters have been putting off for her sake.  Get out there and see the world. It's  lovely.", "I'm going to say that you are mostly NTA. It sounds like she does slow you down, and that is a problem for the activity you were doing. It sounds like you were looking forward to doing everything and weren't willing to give any of it up.\n\nAlso, she pushed you for an answer, and you gave it to her. But you didn't \"not invite her\" because of her weight. It was because of her capabilities. \n\nI'm a large woman, and I can walk circles around people half my size. I hike trails, I run 5ks, I work on my feet all day, and a pumpkin patch with an apple picking orchard would not require me to sit through most of the day. I know a lot of other large people who are similarly motivated. \n\nMy recommendation is that the next time she wants to come with you on a trip that requires more walking than she can handle, let her come, but don't stop for her. If she starts complaining, tell her that she can take a break if she wants, and you will meet back up with her, but you're not tired, and you are going to do X. Tell her that it's okay for her to take a break every time she starts complaining. She'll either take a break by herself or decide she doesn't want to do these types of activities with you. Or, possibly start working on her stamina so she can keep up.", "So I recently lost 60 lbs. 40 more to go. \n\nAnd NTA. I can't tell you how many places I couldn't go to. How much walking I could do BEFORE I allowed my weight gain that I could no longer do. I could see how it affected things and friends and I got so mad at myself. I was embarrassed and disgusted. \n\nI had heart failure. I had pulmonary issues.\nI GOT OFF MY ASS AND DID  SOMETHING. \n\nNow im bench pressing 50 lbs (for now), i ran a 5k over the weekend (first in 3 years). And I bike 4 times a week if I can. \n\nSorry but NTA. I get having kids makes things harder. But she is g the first to go through this and she won't be the last. I got help. I swallowed my pride (like a good little fat girl) and got help. \n\nMaybe this will be her wake up call.", "I'm overweight and I completely see OP'S point. Whenever we go anywhere, I spend most of the time either sitting on a bench, in a cafe, or in the car, depending on where we go. I just read ebooks while I wait. I like to go on trips with the family but I don't mind being \"\"abandoned\"\", in fact I prefer it, rather than thinking I'm spoiling it for them.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but I would have explained nicer.\n\nMaybe frame it like you are looking out for her. \n\nSorry didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to do all that waking. Last time we walked a lot, you needed lots of rest and complained the whole time.\n\nThat leaves it open for her to realize her own shortcomings. And if she says she wants to go, you say ok, but we aren\u2019t taking a bunch of breaks.", "NTA. Her weight isn't the problem really, her attitude is.\n\nI'm disabled and I can't walk far: I'm not very mobile and in a helluva lot of pain. It means outings inevitably wind up with me needing to sit a bunch, and even then I get steadily worse throughout the day.\n\nSo...I ensure my phone has charge and something to read, and when I need to sit, I sit and tell whoever I'm with to keep going and I'll either pick back up with them in a bit, or wait for them to come back around. It's always said and done with zero manipulation, though I sometimes have to persuade ppl to bugger off cos they feel a but bad about leaving me - though after a few trips ppl do get it. But I'll happily show them my books, my snacks, etc, and tell them to take some cool pics or something for me to see later.\n\nSometimes my wife will insist on staying with me, and that's cool, I know she does it for her own reasons not cos I'm guilting her into it. But generally even she will head off and come back in a bit.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get across is there are ways to do this thing where, for whatever reason, you need to sit a bunch and none of them need to involve guilt trips and manipulation.\n\nOP you may need to express the issue more clearly - that it's not the weight, it's that she insists on basically ruining trips out because of it. You're not fat shaming. Hell, I'm fat cos I can't frickin walk! It's nobody else's problem, any more than my chronic pains and lack of mobility are anyone else's problems. My wife shares them with me out of love, but even she knows she can go do stuff when I can't \ud83e\udd37\n\nPlus, and my final point I promise, you are never obligated to take anyone, outside of your kids, on a trip. Doesn't matter why. You don't have to. And your kids are unhappy when she comes along. They're your priority, and their enjoyment comes first. Like, don't throw them under the bus as the reason or anything, just know that putting their needs first is the right thing to be doing.", "INFO do you invite her to girls days that don\u2019t involve a lot of walking?", "It\u2019s not because of her weight it\u2019s because of her inability to keep up. NTA but gotta explain it better.", "I guess I'll get ready for a bunch of pitchforks pointed towards me but hard NTA. You and your girls deserve to be able to enjoy your trips without having to keep up with constant nagging and complaints. They way you described your DIL, she must be obese or have some heart condition if she can't function normally. Being sick or obese is not her fault but being a selfish prick and not being mature and understanding enough to realise that her presence ruins half the trips for everyone else definitely is. She needs to get her entitlement in check and most likely her health too. You did good drawing the hard line because some people can't take a hint.", "It is because she whines and complains and wants everyone to be limited like she is. All she would have to do is be pleasant and set it up so she takes breaks and meets up with the rest of you later. It is not about her limitations, it is about her demanding that no one else gets to go at their own pace. I have physical limitations and try my hardest not to temper other\u2019s activity when I can\u2019t do things. It is possible in fact it is a lot more fun. I\u2019ve learned to do more sedate things places so I enjoy myself too.", "NTA. She insists on going to all events, then complains and won't let anyone go on without her to keep having fun. If she was the least bit considerate about it and tried to compromise I'd change my vote- but since she's not and just wants everyone to suffer with her, NTA.", "This isn't about her weight, it's about her making the trips about her and refusing to let you have a good time because of her FOMO.  She's the one who needs to address her inability be good company on the daughter trips.  If that means she needs to lose weight, fine, but your issue isn't with her weight- it's with her being an absolute energy suck and spoilsport.\n\nClarify that to your son and DIL.\n\nETA: NTA", ">Finally, you\u2019re free to only invite your actual daughters to things, too.\n\n\u201cFinally an excuse to be free of this fake family member\u201d is tripping over possibly the only way to be the asshole here", "NTA. Lots of people saying OP shoulda said something about stamina not weight. In the moment it\u2019s tough to pick all the perfect words to avoid Reddit cleverness, but the rest of the convo included that her weight stopped her from doing things which made it pretty clear it\u2019s not cuz DIL is unattractive for weight, her weight is stopping her fitness.", "Nta. You are free to invite who you want for whatever reason.", "So I\u2019m not going to give a judgment, but going to say that that level of fatigue isn\u2019t normal and it\u2019s worth considering an underlying medical condition.\n\nI\u2019m considered obese (40-42 BMI) and live a very sedentary life in addition to a chronic pain disease but I can go for a day in a pumpkin patch and apple orchard without having to sit down, much less walking around a mall.", "YTA - Why couldn't you talk to her about this like an adult earlier and say some trips aren't for her and how you feel without snapping and telling her she ruins the trips.  I think this was mean.", "As a fat person myself NTA at all. If you\u2019re going to make the entire group stop every little bit because you\u2019re tired you\u2019re stopping the entire group from doing what they wanted to do. I\u2019m in a wheelchair not because of weight I have a genetic condition that causes my joints to dislocate so I can keep up quite well however if I had to walk I\u2019d be in trouble and have to stop but would NEVER suggest anyone was abandoning me just because they wanted to keep going. When we get together as a family we plan things for the people who do lots of walking and those of us who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to stay back and then we plan things that everyone can do. There is zero reason to hold back the entire party just because you can\u2019t keep up. If you want to join in on every single event start figuring out a way to keep up or take your breaks alone and catch up later.", "ESH. You said it was about her *weight*, when it is actually about her complaining and wanting everyone to cater to her. You didn\u00b4t like how she couldn\u00b4t keep up and would want you guys *to stop for her*. If she sat on a bench and didn\u00b4t halt the activity, would you have been this annoyed? Its her *attitude* that you don\u00b4t like, not her weight. \n\nI don\u00b4t blame her for being angry that you told her it was about her weight. Since then she thinks its fatphobia-issue when its really a don\u00b4t-ruin-our-trip issue. You made it about appearance when it was about her attitude around her stamina.\n\nYou could have invited her but set the boundary that she would have to either keep up or deal with having to take a break on her own. That way she would have been invited, but it would have been \"on the contract\" that she would have to entertain herself if she fell behind.", "ESH. The problem isn't her size per se, it's her fitness. If it is size itself, the you are the AH. But what you complain about is that she can't fully participate and holds you back.  Fat people can be physically active. Instead of telling her that her lack of fitness was the issue, you focused on her size. This was both hurtful and inaccurate unless you have been dishonest about your reasons, with us and possibly yourself.\n\nAnd DIL was a bit over the top, probably because you hit a sore spot", "I think this is less about her weight and more about the complaining and wanting everyone to accommodate her. If she can't handle all of the walking, she shouldn't go.", "Heres the thing; i dont think you actually have an issue with her weight, this is really about how she acts. \n\nIf you had first told her it was about how she acts tho, she likely wouldve have blamed it on her weight and still said that you were being fatphobic (which is never okay but again not what i think that youre doing) \n\nYoure NTA but i think the relationship with her and your son wont improve until shes ready to own how she acts and have a conversation about it", "This is why I no longer put any of my events on Facebook. Someone is always hurt they were excluded. Even on my birthday I ask others not to share anything. Time for all these adults to grow up.", "I think you could have said it better.  She doesn\u2019t have enough stamina for some of your outings. My bmi is in the obesity range. I can walk all I need to and at a fast clip for shopping or virtually any outing that doesn\u2019t involve an incline ( like a hiking trail). My three sport athlete son says I walk too fast.  So while I definitely need to lose weight for my overall well being ( heart , joints , digestive system etc) I would not slow anybody down on a shopping trip due to my weight.", "NTA. Thry dont need to be involved in all of them especialy if they cant handle the outing.", "I\u2019m overweight and say NTA. \n\nJust because she can\u2019t do things doesn\u2019t mean the rest of you shouldn\u2019t be able to. She\u2019s not entitled to an invitation to every outing.", "OP is kind of a weight snob. She states that her son's wife was average weight before they had kids, but after the kids, it got worse. \n\nNot, it got bad, it got worse. Implies that she already thought average weight was bad.", "ESH\n\nI am fat. I weigh 250 pounds at 5'6\". However, I am constantly standing and moving for 10 hours a day at my job. (I only sit for part of my 30 minute lunch.) I frequently take my niece and nephew to places that involve lots of walking like museums, zoos, parks, and, yes, pumpkin patches. I would never spend half the time sitting if I were on a window shopping outing at a mall. I also wouldn't be upset if someone didn't invite me to window  shop at the mall, because  I wouldn't enjoy it in the slightest.\n\nYour issue with your DIL isn't her weight, but her inability or unwillingness to fully participate. If you hadn't invited her, but said that it was because she hasn't enjoyed activities with lots of movement in the past, you'd be 100% fine. It's the blaming it on her weight that I take issue with.\n\nShe, of course, is an asshole for not participating in outings she is invited to and then getting upset that she isn't invited on those outings.", "You\u2019re not the asshole. You may come off as insensitive but the truth is the truth, it not your job to soften the blow. You weren\u2019t just randomly attacking her for her weight, it\u2019s the limitations that she has because of it.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA. It\u2019s a tough thing for her to hear, but it\u2019s the truth. Sure you could have been a little more gentle and not mentioned the weight directly. Like \u201cYou always need to take a lot of breaks when a lot of walking is involved, so I didn\u2019t think you would enjoy it.\u201d\n\nHowever her weight is not only affecting her. It\u2019s ruining the fun for others. I\u2019m sure it hurts, but it sounds like she needed a wake-up call.\n\nMy mother (not overweight) is a lifelong smoker who had a quadruple bypass several years ago. When I moved abroad from the US to a European country, she came to visit me. I was so happy to have her here, but it was very mentally exhausting because she can\u2019t walk very far without having to stop. So all the activities we went to were very long and drawn out. We didn\u2019t get to do half the things I wanted to show her. I don\u2019t get to see her very often anymore, but if I did, I would have to draw the line with her like you did with DIL.", "NTA\n\nThe truth needed to be said.", "Definitely NTA. I will feel terrible if my girlfriends had to wait for me when we are hiking or downtown, hell no, nobody got time for that. She wants to go along, she needs to get herself in the appropriate shape so she can keep up. It\u2019s not that hard. A walk 30 minutes a day will do that. If she doesn\u2019t want to, that\u2019s on her, but no one else has to suffer for it.", "NTA\n\nI say this as a fat guy.  Being fat sucks and is, for most of us, a choice.  I started walking and could barely make it around the block.  I'm up to 2.5 miles most days.  It's hard work.  It's tough.  Before I did the work to get where I'm at, I was your DIL.  It sucked.  It was hard to watch everyone else just go about their day like nothing, but I couldn't because I was carrying so much extra weight.  I knew it was my fault, but that didn't make it sting less.  \n\nYou're not an asshole for not wanting to stop your and your daughters fun because someone isn't fit enough to walk around the mall.  I'm of the mindset that we need to stop coddling us fat people.  Don't be mean to us, but stop coddling us.  Being fat is unhealthy.  Period.", "YTA.

It\u2019s not your job to baby sit her or coddle her", "ESH.\n\nI want to be clear here - I think there is only one issue here for you:  You are referencing her weight specifically.\n\nHer weight is not the issue;  her level of fitness is.\n\nI'm classified as morbidly obese.

Sure, she still may have gotten angry but at least nobody could reasonably accuse you of just being mean. Next time I would take some of the other commenters\u2019 suggestions and invite her but keep going without her even if she decides to stop.", "It's perfectly legitimate to consider people's physical abilities to do something when you're planning an outing. So you are NTA in recognizing that a strenuous physical day trumping through an apple orchard would be difficult for your DIL. \n\nBut...

Your disgust with her is so obvious in the way you describe her and I'm sure that it comes across in every interaction you have with her.\n\nYou could have called her and explained the level of physical activity that was going to occur on the outing, and then follow that up by saying you had concerns about her comfort level and that therefore you think it would probably be better if she did not go on the trip.

Comment on the behavior that brings people down, i.e., negativity, constant breaks, not being able to do everything you want to do because she insists you stay with her. But not her weight.

My father (who is normal weight and exercises) noticed he was getting tired and couldn't physically do much. Turns out he needed a triple bypass. You are allowed to do things that are active, but you went about this in a really bad way.

The last girls trip to the mall was spent sitting on a bench half the day since she needed constant break. If you try to leave she will go on about abandoning her. It\u2019s annoying.\n\nI invited the girls to go to a farm for pumpkin patch and pick some apples. It has big orchards and a ton of walking. We went it was a great time and some pictures went on Facebook. I got a call from Beth asking why she wasn\u2019t invited. I lied saying it was just a family trip and she accused me of lying.\n\nI had enough and told her the truth. I told her she wasn\u2019t invited due her weight.

I either don't go places I know I can't handle or I pregame a few ibuprofen  and make it work. You are NTA.

You are still NTA for wanting to enjoy your trip.", "You would have been better to just say this.\n\nAfter all, it's not ultimately about her weight, it's about her behaviour (which is indirectly caused by her weight. Probably.)\n\nYou could have directly addressed the behaviour without the fat shaming. She's not really 'too fat', she's 'too inactive'.\n\nWon't call you TA though because you have a good point. Just could have delivered it better.", "I have health issues and get exhausted easily, it\u2019s something that I\u2019m working on taking control of. However, if I was invited somewhere and couldn\u2019t keep up I would encourage the others to continue and we could meet later, even if that meant I spent the day solo and met at the car to go home. \n\nI think it perfectly reasonable to not invite her if trips are constantly hindered because of her", "Totally understandable. Definitely NTA.\nIt seems your breaking point isn\u2019t even the fact that she wants breaks, but that she also expects the rest of you to sit with her when she takes them. That is unreasonable.\nI tend to be a people pleaser, but even the best concession I would give her in your shoes is that while she is invited again, she has to understand that she will likely be taking her breaks alone, especially if she needs more than one.\nHaving said that, there is nothing wrong with you wanting time with just your daughters, especially is DIL doesn\u2019t fit the vibe.", "NTA but\u2026I would not have mentioned weight. I would\u2019ve said \u201cbecause you don\u2019t like to be as active and when you want to rest and we want to keep going, you make us feel guilty.\u201d  But you were put on the spot.  Also, you are entitled to go places with just your daughters and shouldn\u2019t have had to defend that.", "I\u2019m fat and I approve of what you did. My weight has fluctuated over the years and somethings I just can\u2019t do. So you know what if I had to sit out I did it alone.", "Honestly, I currently have an injury that prevents me from walking a lot and I need frequent breaks. I totally understand that I should not do certain things right now because I bring others down. Your DIL needs to recognize that not everything is about her.", "Not being able to join my friends and family on activities is the number one reason I went through a weight loss journey. It wasn\u2019t so I could \u201cbe thin and look good.\u201d It was so I could hike, bike, run, go camping, go out dancing, travel and see the world without getting exhausted. \n\nWe only have one life to see and experience as much as possible. So many people are not able to give them selves the gift of that kind of freedom. So if DIL is able to, why wouldn\u2019t she??\n\n(I know it\u2019s hard and daunting to begin the path fitness and weight loss. I\u2019ve been there. But I just remember ever week feeling physically better than the one before it, and that alone made the effort worth it.)", "You're not wrong.", "seriously - not everything is for everyone, and it's her fault that activities with walking aren't for her.", "And see that's the issue.\n\nIf she were fat and fit enough to keep up it wouldn't be a problem. \n\nIf she were unfit and didn't mind sitting alone while other people went on when she needed a break, it wouldn't be a problem. \n\nIt's being unfit and selfish enough to demand that other people sit around when you have to.", "Agreed with OP of this thread, but I would approach slightly differently.\n\nI'd still invite her but be VERY clear what the plans are and tell her you won't be slowing down for anyone (even if its obviously just her). Hopefully she either learns quick, or might have an ah-ha moment of realizing she needs to get in shape.", "Look, tell her that she can come to things like the orchard if she understands that the group isn't moving at her pace.", "As a fat person with chronic pain, NTA. I'm not sure why she needs to sit so much if her only issue you know of is her weight. I feel for her kid5 probably don't get to do as much as they'd like with their mom.\n\nIt's okay to have separate outings, too. If you're going somewhere that involves more sitting, great! But her attitude about holding up the group sucks, and it is probably the worst part of the situation by a lot.", "As an obese person with arthritis, NTA at all. I love going on outings! If I go somewhere and need a break, that's on me. I never make someone stay behind with me. I'm an adult and can sit by myself until you're done or I'm ready to rejoin. If she can't manage, then that is on her. She has no right to ruin your outings because she can't keep up. May I suggest maybe making smaller, easier outings with her (i.e. Those wine & painting things, a movie, etc), and say future ones with a lot of walking are just mother/daughter days?", "When I first started reading the post, I thought of my mother in law, who is a larger woman, maybe 350? Not entirely sure. Great lady, but not active at all. When you got to the apple orchard part I knew I had to share. \n\nWe regularly get together with the greater family and if it\u2019s anything somewhat physical, MIL backs out for one reason or another. Recently the plan was to go apple and pumpkin picking. We were surprised to see MIL there!\n\nAfter walking around the orchard and loading all of our apples into a cart that I was pulling, we stopped at the main storefront for some food. When we got settled I happened to look at MIL who was red in the face and sweating bullets. This was a 65F degree day. We honestly thought she was having heat stroke or worse for a while and it became a whole thing. She is doing fine now. \n\nSo no, you are NTA , as you said if she makes you wait near the bench for her that\u2019s borderline manipulation. If she didn\u2019t take breaks it could have ended similar to how it did with my MIL.", "It sounds like she doesn't even enjoy those trips. It's tough, but sometimes you just have to cut out the negativity for your own mental health. I've had to do the same with people in my family. \n\nThe only thing I would have done differently was to not say that it was about her weight but about her attitude. She sucks the joy out of everything you all do and is not actively engaged.", "The part where she gets upset if y\u2019all leave her is where I ended up not on her side. I understand her wanting to be included but it\u2019s not fair of her to expect for everyone to wait on her because she\u2019s not capable of keeping up. \n\nI do wonder if this woman is ok, like\u2026 mentally. Bc it sounds like the answer is no. \n\nAlso depending on how you worded it to her depends on whether or not you could\u2019ve been nicer.

I know she would complain but you\u2019d get over it real quickly.", "You are completely within your rights to not do things with her that she's not capable of. If she were willing to take a break while you guys continued on, I'm guessing that wouldn't be an issue. \n\nThe problem isn't her weight, though. It's her attitude. The problem is that she wants everyone else to be as limited as her. \n\nI'm fat. I hike, forage for food, go to amusement parks, play soccer, garden.

DIL was in the wrong and she needs to either work on improving her stamina or deal with not being invited to certain outings due to her limitations.", "Yeah I'm pretty big but when we go on hikes I don't make people wait for me, but also don't see the need for resting so often that it ruined the whole experience.  Mall walking and needing a rest? That's crazy.", ">we would have loved to take you, but it's very physically demanding\n\nThis is a fair take, to be honest.", "Even if she was in great shape or was a more active larger person who could handle the trip, her attendance still isn't required if OP wants to just go do something with her daughters. I think the expectation to tag along is also an issue in itself.", "Honestly I agree with this. One of my close friends is relatively overweight and we were planning on going on a trip with another friend who wanted to go on a hike. She and I discussed the different routes, one was one mile and not a huge incline but my friend said she was nervous she was going to be unable to do it because of her weight and would need a lot of breaks. We kinda ended up deciding that the two of us would go without our other friend which sucks but there\u2019s no way she would have been able to do this without significant breaks. \n\nIt isn\u2019t meant to be mean it\u2019s just realism. There is definitely a way to discuss it though. NTA - just a difficult situation.", ">There is nothing fatphobic about this.\n\nMild disagreement, and here's why.  \"We didn't bring you because we are sick of taking breaks all the time and listening to you complain\" is addressing the actual problems--she could solve them by not bitching about resting on a bench alone, or she could solve them by getting into better shape.\n\nMy mom, who is skinny as a rail, spent 60% of my childhood trips to beaches and amusement parks sitting on a bench with a book by herself because she wasn't in physical condition to keep up with my dad and brothers.  In her case it was a bad back and she never complained about it.\n\nI'm leaving open the idea that DIL could be lazy and whiny at ANY weight, you know?", "Yup. I was that skinny annoying person once upon a time who could not keep up on a hike to save my life. It took a lot for me to get my stamina up and it ebbs and flows regardless of my fluctuating weight.", "This! I\u2019m average size in a fun size package. I love joining in on things but I know my abilities. I have asthma, a heart thing and a bad back\u2026you\u2019d never know from looking at me but I don\u2019t make it other people\u2019s problem. I have no problem catching up or waiting.", "Hey thanks!!!! I am proud. I'm struggling a bit now but I won't be deterred lol. \n\nA lot had to change. I miss somethings. Like pizza and wine. But I've gained so much positivity and activity that it's not even worth it.", "Thanks! Back at ya. Yea it feels so good. So what's crazy is I'm still heavier (scale) then my lowest weight but my blood work and all that is perfect. That's so motivating to me. I was pre everything bc of diet choices. Now I'm do healthy it helps me move better. And the doctors say the weight will keep going down if I keep eating healthy. It's amazing how much easier things are lol", "Thank you. That's very kind. And encouraging! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc", "Pre pandemic I was getting into lifting. But I was eating terribly so I don't think I did as well as I could have.

And the medal lol\n\nHonestly? 99% of my gym experience is positive. To begin I would suggest a YMCA or that type of center. They'll have a lot of low impact beginner stuff that you can increase on. \nAsk someone who knows about weights bc if you want toning you might want some low weight/higher rep combo. \n\nBut I am no expert. That's just been my experience.", "That's amazing  it took me twice. And some tough love. Congrats!!!!", "Congrats!!!! The change is an adjustment but the benefits do out weight anything else!", "Exactly. Plenty of overweight people can still walk around without getting tired. \n\nThe problem is that the DIL can't keep up with basic everyday exertion. OP should've focused on that. It's 100% possible (might be unlikely, but it's possible) that the DIL can strengthen herself and improve her condition *and not lose any weight at all*. With how OP framed it, even that won't be enough to get invited on \"girls' day out\" trips.", "As the planner for basically anything, I always gauge people's ability to walk a lot and I've known very overweight people who have great stamina and don't struggle to keep up.\n\nAt the same time, I've known average people who just obviously live sedentary lives because theyre stamina is nonexistent and they get tired quickly.\n\nYes it's most likely the weight in OP's case but that isn't the issue they have, it's the cause. The cause isn't yours to worry about, I don't care WHY someone can't keep up, I only care that they can't.", "So if you are damned either way, the best thing is to pick the course where you look least bad.", "Right?!? The lack of compassion on this thread is really, really alarming. I understand why OP feels the way she does, but nowhere does she say they\u2019ve even had conversations about why she hasn\u2019t lost the weight. It could be medication, depression, denial. A number of things. I hope she never has anything happen to her that changes her body or makes it hard for her to maintain her lower weight.", ">She is due a bit of respect and dignity.\n\nSo is OP, who DiL bullies when they go out and demands she be included in everything.", "Scrolled way too long to get to this.", "Redditors are so awful. I am both the fittest person in some friend groups and the fattest person in other friend groups and I\u2019ve experienced both sides of the spectrum. I\u2019ve also experienced holding back because of other constraints, like my friends are sick, or they have their children with them for the day, or they have to be home early for whatever reason, because we\u2019re all adults with needs and responsibilities. \n\nWhen you invite people to spend time with you, you do whatever is in the least-abled person\u2019s abilities. You never, *ever* choose an activity or a restaurant or an event that the invited people can\u2019t do. My friend has gout? I don\u2019t invite him to seafood restaurants and get huffy when he complains there\u2019s nothing for him to eat and he\u2019s still hungry. I\u2019ll find a fried chicken restaurant or BBQ joint or trendy noodle bar instead. My friend has her kids? Then we don\u2019t go to the bar, we\u2019ll stay in and have drinks and play board games instead. My friend has $5 in his bank account? Then we\u2019ll pack food from home and carpool to a picnic. Somebody hikes really slow? Then we hike at THEIR pace and we pick hikes with easy to moderate difficulty levels that we think THEY can accomplish, and we plan for lots of extra time and breaks.They got to be home early? Then we start early. It\u2019s so simple! \n\nIt\u2019s easy, and it doesn\u2019t stop me from doing what I want to do, I just save the more strenuous or adult or seafood-laden activities for another time with another group of people. Or I do things on my own. Or I do the more strenuous things with the more able-bodied people in the group on days that the less able-bodied people would be unavailable anyway, so that they\u2019re not missing out on time that we could have all spent together. The point of hanging out with the people I love is not the fun activity, it\u2019s the quality time. I\u2019m not inviting them because I want to go out and spend money, I\u2019m inviting them because I want to be with them. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine being invited to things with people that allegedly love me, only for them to be upset they\u2019re always having to wait for me, or for them to want to ditch me because I can\u2019t keep up. Even my skinniest, most athletic friends that I\u2019ve known less than a year would never treat me like that, and this is that poor woman\u2019s family treating her this way. They\u2019re fucking awful.", "It's usually people who have never had to deal with that much weight or medical issues like the ones being faced in whatever story.

Cleaning house- nope I can pay someone to do that. Babysitting grandson one day a week-yep. Just plan low activity days before and after. If people want to go hiking- have fun.

What have your doctors said causes this? I can't figure out why suddenly I have all of these strange things and this swelling doesn't make any sense.

She either has to keep up, stay home, figure out a way to take breaks and meet up later, or leave early if she needs to at the very least. But she sounds high maintenance and self-centered.

You can also push your thumb into a swollen area for like a minute, and take a pic of the dent so they can see what level of swelling you're talking about. I also had reynaud's so to show that (and make my camera stop trying to color correct me) I would put someone else's hand near my skin or if I had an unaffected patch of skin, put that next to it, so you could see the purple / bluing.\n\nIt's really hard to show your symptoms in a doc's office. You're in a 70 degree room, sitting for at least 30 mins, in a comfy chair. Pictures help tell your story.\n\nAll that being said, some doctors just suck. Get a referral to a rheumatologist. That's step 1. If they refuse to refer, ask them to note that refusal in your chart. They'll sometimes change their tune if it's going on paper.\n\nDocument all your symptoms for your rheumo. Print it out, bring it with you. Ask for it to be put into your chart, too. It takes a while sometimes to figure out what is wrong with you; don't get discouraged. As long as they are trying, and you're getting tests & other referrals to help narrow it down, keep on course.\n\nIf your rheumo is NOT trying or doing anything beyond standard bloodwork (CBC w diff, SED rate, standard blood panels) after visit 2, fire your rheumo. My third rheumo in 3 years finally was the good one. I left her office with 6 referrals. We ran me through the ringer (hematologist, oncologist, allergist, sports medicine PT, dermatologist, gastro, pulmo, etc). I had 2 surgeries and I dunno how many CT scans and biopsies and tests in 6 months. We found a whole bunch of goodies (hence the pack), but the dang dermo was the clincher. Biopsy of a lil elbow dryness and surprise! It's psoriasis. That was the puzzle piece to make sense of the tests and symptoms. Psoriatic arthritis. Without all that, I wouldn't have known that I have crohns, Sjogrens, joint hypermobility disorder (strongly suspect hEDS but apparently genetic testing is hard to get), extensive diverticulosis, and some shit I'm probably forgetting ontop of psoriatic arthritis.

I dont need to have the support while walking most of the time (i only get uneasy on my feet if it's a severe pain day), but it helps me manage the pain when walking or standing too long. \n\nI agree. This sounds like more than just her weight. What -exactly- makes her need the break? Is it just being tired, or are there aches and pains, too? She definitely should see a doctor to see if anything else is going on. Honestly, if it is just the weight, she might benefit from having more support with that as well. If she gained the weight from having her child and the child is now 8, then maybe some extra help from a nutritionist or something might help in that regard too. \n\nOverall, though, this all could have been dealt with with more sensitivity.

If you want to go you are invited, but please understand that if you get tired, you'll have to catch up with us if we're not ready to rest' or something like that. Even that sounds a little mean, but it's much better than saying 'hey, we didn't invite you because you're fat and you ruin outings' or wondering why she wasn't invited. Even when I knew I couldn't do certain things, it made me feel loved and remembered to be invited. My family knew WHY I couldn't always go, but I'd try at times and just...catch up, or wait somewhere for them to return so I could still spend time with them.\n\nLosing weight is very difficult, and some can't do it (or do it well/healthily) for many reasons. Be it genetics, mental health issues, pain...try to maybe understand her more. (Though, shitty-ass behavior is NOT acceptable, no matter how sick/mentally ill/in pain/out of shape one may be.) If you talk to her and she continues to be shitty, then at least you tried to understand/be nice, right?", "Definitely time to see a doctor, too. Get her bloodwork done, test for deficiencies in nutrients or an endocrine issue. A doctor might also recommend physical therapy instead of just going to the gym, if the issue isn't just that she lacks endurance, it's that she's feeling pain. A PT has more training than a gym instructor on how to ease into super gentle exercises, and if there's something else potentially contributing to the pain, they can help deal with that.", "Yeah, I wonder if she has something else going on. Depeesssion, thyroid. Autoimmune arthritis\u2026but of course obesity can also just make your hurt. The swollen ankles specifically need looked into to see if her heart is functioning alright. I hope she has talked to a doctor.\n\nWith that said, she also needs to realize how her physical abilities affect her capacity to do things. I have some physical disabilities. You wouldn\u2019t know by just looking at me but it limits my abilities to do things. It sucks. But I evaluate my capabilities and try to make sure I don\u2019t interfere with someone else\u2019s enjoyment. But there are also times that others try and make sure to include me. \n\nOP is NTA for going to the event with just her daughters without her DIL because her DIL can\u2019t keep up. She could have phrased it to her DIL in terms of her ability though. Also, she can do things with her daughters without her DIL.", "Right? OP says she \"hasn't lost the baby weight,\" but even someone who gains the absolute most possible during 9 months of pregnancy and then some wouldn't be this incapacitated. Maybe OP was trying to mince her words, but this sounds like the activity limit of someone who is 500+ lbs, not someone who just packed on some pounds", "For sure. I'm an obese male but walked 36 miles in 6 days when I visited Portugal. This person must be grossly, morbidly obese to have such problems and needs to get checked out.", "Yep. I have many friends who are \"obese\". They do hot yoga, swim laps, hike for hours, practice karate, and bike on the peleton every day. Having excess adipose tissue doesn't mean there isn't a fuck ton of muscle underneath.", "Why do people keep commenting this? OP flat out said they did try to be tactful and kinder but Beth dragged it on and called him a liar. Not to mention years of accommodating her with no commentary at all. I\u2019m sorry but being obese doesn\u2019t mean you get to play by toddler rules when you\u2019re a full blown adult.", "This. I was overweight and pretty active, but all of a sudden I was exhausted all the time and couldn\u2019t keep up. It ended up being fibromyalgia. You can\u2019t just assume it\u2019s the weight. \n\nI know OP is tired of accommodating her inability to keep up, but I need to go with ESH here. OP for assuming it\u2019s just the weight and the DIL for expecting everyone to keep it to her pace all the time\u2026", "I complained to multiple doctors that I was tired. Couldn't make myself get up. I put on weight. I spent 6ish years going doctor to doctor to be told if I just exercised I'd lose weight or if I ate less. I was barely eating but since I had no energy I was eating fast, easy food so weight was flying on (PCOS too so I have to be careful what I eat). \n\nI finally, finally got answers earlier this year. I had to go to a neuro for a disorder that I am now on meds for and they sent me to an endo who tested my vitamin d levels. They were incredibly low that my pcp was shocked. I've been taking over the counter and now training for a marathon and practicing with my kids for their soccer games. Earlier this year I was drained just walking to the post office.

I was also so tired, I'd literally fall asleep anywhere. People stopped inviting me to things because I physically couldn't do them. \n\nIt had nothing to do with my weight and everything to do with the fact that my body was a swollen, fatigued, nutrient deficient mess. I wasn't even at my highest weight when this happened, but I was quickly gaining because of it. \n\nGetting my thyroid under control with meds has been huge. I noticed when I was over medicated because I remembered what it felt like to be normal. When my TSH was 94, I couldn't remember what normal felt like. I couldn't remember a day when I woke up with energy or a day my feet and ankles didn't feel like they were going to burst.", "Yes I just made a comment as well that I don\u2019t think this girl is just overweight - I think she\u2019s ignoring something underlying.", "Recently my MIL told me when we first met she was expecting me to be unable to do the hiking we\u2019d all planned on (we went to visit and they live near the mountains). I was like 220 (at 5\u20193) at the time and had zero problem keeping up. Fat doesn\u2019t have to mean immobile. This girl needs to see a doctor and get moving before she ends up in a wheelchair.", "Awesome for you! I've recently been losing weight too! However, like you even when I was my biggest I was still really active. I have a 7yo boy and there are 5 other kids on the street that he plays with. So I am/was always out there with them and our furbaby. \n\nFor about a year whenever I went to the Dr I'd let them weigh me but asked them not to tell me (because I was getting discouraged about my weight). Anyway last week I was at the Dr and told her I didn't want to know unless I had lost some (now I had already figured I had lost some because some of my clothes were fitting better or getting saggy). Turns out that in 6 months I've lost 35lbs! Still got a ways to go, 20 year high-school reunion coming up, lol. \n\nAgain congratulations! I hope your journey keeps going well for you \ud83d\ude42", "I\u2019ve also lost a significant amount of weight. At my lowest, I was <129lb (which is very small for my height/build). I was constantly fatigued as I was lacking in nutrients. It can go both ways.", "The same thing happened to me...at my highest weight I could pretty much keep up, then I lost 130lbs and my immune disorder kicked into high gear and now I walk with a cane at 53!  It sucks so much!", "2 months ago I was swimming and had energy like crazy. Now between September 7th-28th I have had 3 surgeries and an amputation and I can't even make it through a quick trip to the store without being wiped out.", "Yeah I knew a large woman who walked 5 miles to and 5 miles from work.", "I'm still huge, unfortunately, but I can easily(ish) walk for five or six hours in a day. I'm not saying weight might not come into Beth's particular equation, but there's every chance there's more factors in play.", "Same. Still have long COVID. Still can\u2019t run but I could run obese before COVID. I visibly overheat immediately if you make me speed walk. Doing housework too fast still requires a shower. There is so much wrong but I\u2019m a healthy weight now so people have no idea.", "I haven\u2019t been clinically obese but pretty close and even then I could do activities like this without trouble. I now have issues with fatigue and while I work out and am in some ways fairly fit and have a physical job, the fatigue wipes me out bad when it hits. I also have fat friends with far more energy than me that hike and go dancing, etc. I say all that because being fat or obese does not on its own mean someone can\u2019t walk for hours a day. I wonder if DIL has healthcare access (or the time with all the kids!) to look into this? Fatigue is soooo hard to get treated, at least in the US, especially for women, especially for fat women. \n\nOP sounds really fatphobic for equating weight to stamina. Does she even like DIL? I would be hurt if I was being excluded from family fun like this, although I also get that certain activities are beyond my abilities \u2014 is there a fair mixture of family outings or are they all so active that DIL can\u2019t ever go? I think there is a lot more to deal with than \u201cweight\u201d and I hope OP wants to work through this. I love physical activity too so I get it, but any of us can become disabled at any time, and I think it\u2019s really important to make sure you\u2019re not damaging your relationships by consistently excluding a family member.", "Exactly this! At my biggest I was 200 lbs. This was going from about 105-110 to 200. I was at the time a daycare/pre-school worker. I was on my feet 8 hours a day, running up and down stairs all day, up and down off the floor, playing with children, chasing them around the playground, pushing them on swings, carrying the younger ones when necessary. There was no breaks or sitting on a bench to rest for half the day. It was constant go go go. This definitely sounds like DIL has more going on then just being overweight.", "100% agree. At my heaviest, I weighed 304 pounds. I also played tennis four days a week and could walk for miles without stopping. Meanwhile, my mother, who at the time was half my weight, would have to take her car to drive three blocks because she had so much swelling from her autoimmune that she couldn\u2019t walk. When you are at the point that you can\u2019t walk a few steps, it\u2019s not the weight. There is something else that is the overriding cause to mobility problems.", "Yep. Having insulin resistance will leave someone exhausted because the energy isn't getting into your cells. When I was 170 lbs I was exhausted all the time - even being very active, because my body wasn't getting enough energy. PCOS sucks. Now I'm 235lbs and I have way more energy because I take metformin. I'm not diabetic. But because I was \"skinny/fit\" no one cared to actually test me for anything and just told me to sleep more, exercise more, and lose weight. Even when my BMI was within normal range. It's infuriating.", "Sorry, but I have a genuine question, with no malice intended.\nHow are you over 300 pounds if you are physically active? Theoretically, the larger you are, the easier it is to lose weight as it drops off faster. So if you are burning x amount of calories a day, you should be accidentally be losing weight.\nI really do want to understand jow this is possible.", "I'm a size 20 and do something similar! Around 20,000 steps a night it is ridiculous to use weight as an excuse", "There's a whole sport where the majority of athletes are obese.

It wouldn't matter if Beth were thin but easily fatigued and made everyone constantly stop with her and complained whenever they tried to go ahead.

You definitely see the super fat people at Wal Mart that can't get around without mobility aids. On the other end you have people like halfbor bjornson that are also fat looking but can pull a fucking airplane. Not all fat people are built the same.\n\nBeing fat it will take more force to just move around. If you do that a lot your muscles will catch up. But if you just get fat and stay super sedentary, your muscles or even bones may not catch up and you end up with mobility issues", "LMAO this is pants on head insanity. You're splitting hairs (poorly) to make yourself feel better. It just isn't the case. We aren't discussing someone squatting 600lbs fat this is lazy unproductive fat and you know it.", "1. Pulling extra weight around does not make you athletic. Sorry. Maybe you feel like you have solid muscles under it all but your organs and joints are still strained and under duress. That\u2019s not healthy no matter how much you try to convince yourself. We all have muscles under our fat. It\u2019s not a special condition of being overweight.\n\n2.

It is that she can't keep up, expects other people to accommodate her when she can't keep up, and has a crappy entitled attitude. \n\nNone of those things are because she is fat and these comments are full of people with examples of how they are fat and can either keep up or make a point not to be entitled and hold others back.\n\nYou could be entitled and holding other people back because you're older or because you have any other kind of health condition and the answer would still be that your attitude and entitlement are the real issue. \n\nFat, like old or ugly, comes with a whole set of societal judgements that there is no reason to get into here. It isn't helpful, it isn't kind and it isn't the issue. \n\nThe MIL is mad and that is fair, but making it about her weight was lashing out and landing a low blow. Her attitude and her mobility are two clear things she can work to improve. Focusing on those, even as you express your totally justified frustration, is honest while still being kind and helpful.", "I\u2019ve been reading all of this wondering fibro too.
