Most of the stuff I wanna do is outside, they hate being outside. My stepkids are always saying how everything I like is so gay. I dont need those vibes on my birthday call me immature I dont care, my birthday is super important to me. \nWhatever lol my boyfriend says he understands and will plan to have their mom keep them that weekend but my mom and my sisters told me I sound like a bitch not wanting to include them so I wanna hear some opinions thanks :)", "created_utc": 1693638362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/167vo07/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_my_stepkids_on_my/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why are you dating someone with kids when you want a lifestyle that doesn't factor in how kids are?", "He probably just wants *all three of his kids there*. Because that\u2019s what you are.

The kids will never stop complaining until they have kids of their own and the complaints will just change. Most of the time until they have kids of their own they will come before you.

You have the right to celebrate your birthday any way you want but your boyfriend is a parent first. This is not the relationship for you.", "NTA\n\nA parent can still prioritize their children & be a good parent without making their children the singular focus of their lives. Parents often make time for themselves for adult only stuff (not sex stuff). And it\u2019s completely reasonable and does not mean you are not accepting of your partner\u2019s children if you don\u2019t want the children on every date with you. \n\nYour boyfriend literally wanted to make you & a 9 year old have a joint birthday celebration (would he suggest that if he was dating a woman closer to his age?). That\u2019s unreasonable. You aren\u2019t trying to take away the 9 year olds bday, it\u2019s the next week. You just want to have an adult 24th birthday event.

Frankly that's up to you. You didn't come here to ask our opinions on your realtionship. \n\nHere's my question where is Mom in this. Do the kids live with her most of the time? Is it possible for the kids to go to her place for a day? \n\nIf none of this is possible YTA... sorta Kids are to young too be by themselves. What needs to be done is purchase a charger that can be charged so they can hook their phones into it. You live with the kids they go with you unfortunately\n\nIf they can go to Mom's a friend or just not come over (depending where they live) then not the AH. If other things can be done for the kids boyfriend is the AH for insisting on combining the 2 birthdays. A 23f and 12m have next to nothing in common. It truly depends in this case on your living situation", "OP sounds immature to be honest. Bf's kids will always be more important.

One is almost a teenager. That's a difficult stage to navigate. \n\nI am wondering if you are living together yet? Also becoming a stepparent is difficult.
