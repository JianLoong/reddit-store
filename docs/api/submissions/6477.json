We agreed to announce the engagement at the family Christmas party. My sister and her husband, who are both a couple years older than me, are also there. My sister and I have generally always gotten along, although her husband can tend to come off as a little rude at times, but he\u2019s never outright been a dick.\n\nSo we do a little gift exchange, and at the end of it, my fianc\u00e9e and I decide to make our announcement. So I say my piece, and everyone\u2019s excited about it. It was a nice moment that I was proud to have.\n\nThen my sister stands and holds up an unopened gift for our mother. Mom opens it, and it\u2019s a framed ultrasound image showing that my sister is pregnant, about a month along. It\u2019s a happy moment and I was happy to share in it. But after that, the pregnancy was all anyone talked about for the rest of the day, and the days after that. It was like they had completely forgotten about my fianc\u00e9e and I being engaged.\n\nI felt like my fianc\u00e9e had been cast aside. I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene at the party, because I was happy for my sister. Then every day of the following week, all anyone wanted to talk about was the baby.\n\nFinally, New Year\u2019s Eve came along. The party we have for that switches hosts every year, and it\u2019s my sister\u2019s house this time. My fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t want to go to that party because she felt uncomfortable. So I called them, and my brother in law answers. He asked me what was up, and I told him we weren\u2019t going to be able to make it. He tried to change my mind, saying \u201cyou and your girlfriend can come along\u201d. Like he had forgotten, or hadn\u2019t even acknowledged that we were engaged. I reminded him of our engagement, to which he said he couldn\u2019t have known since everyone was so excited about the baby. I hung up on him then, and tried to just move on from it.\n\nThen my sister called and asked me why I was upset about her baby. I told her I wasn\u2019t upset about it. I said it hurt when our family seemed to care more about her baby to the point that my fianc\u00e9e and I being engaged may as well have not happened because no one acknowledged it. She told me to grow up, and said it was selfish of me to avoid coming to a party becuase I was jealous of her happiness. I said that it wasn\u2019t that I was jealous, like I said I\u2019m happy for her that she\u2019s having a baby. But while she\u2019s taking a step in her life, I\u2019m also taking a step in my own life. I\u2019m engaged to a woman that I love and that I am prepared to spend the rest of my life with, and it feels like no one has acknowledged or respected that. Afterwards, she said I was being dramatic and that people would be more than happy to care about it when the wedding happened. Then she said I should quit whining and come to the party. I told her that I didn\u2019t want to go to a party hosted by someone who wouldn\u2019t be as happy for me as I am for her, and I hung up.\n\nEDIT: My anger was most definitely misplaced in this situation, it isn\u2019t my sisters fault that things happened how they did, and I should have handled the situation better.\n\nEDIT 2: Just so new people are aware, I have called my sister and we\u2019ve both apologized to each other. I\u2019m going to see her this weekend, so everything is going well.", "created_utc": 1672850170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10380zr/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_sisters_nys/", "score": 4542, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should have waited to let you have your moment and then given your mother the gift.  She also should have announced that she didn\u2019t know you were announcing your engagement and didn\u2019t want to compete but we had the same idea and here mom, we have 1 more gift for you.  \n\nI think you should also tell her what BIL said on the phone as evidence that she overshadowed you to the point that he couldn\u2019t remember.  \n\nAs a compromise ask if she can have a special toast or announcement for you guys so you can get some of that attention.", "YTA.\n\nYour sister made no effort to overshadow your engagement.  She had the framed ultrasound wrapped up as a gift before you even made your announcement in front of the family.  The overshadowing was just your family\u2019s naturally greater excitement over the pregnancy.  You\u2019ve got no right to be salty over this.  Grow up and be happy for your sister.", "NAH It's an unfortunate situation. It is fair for you to feel upset that your engagement is not getting the attention it deserves. However if you think missing your sisters party will get things back on track then I fear you may be mistaken. This is more likely to cause a bigger rift between you. You may need to decide is your engagement news more important to you than your relationship with your sister", "I can\u2019t decide between NAH or E S H here, so I\u2019ll err on the side of the positive. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re blaming your sister for announcing her pregnancy at Christmas\u2026just that you\u2019re upset that no one in the family really acknowledged your big news after her announcement. I understand how this would hurt your feelings. Refusing to go to her NYE party seems more like a punishment though\u2026which (if so) isn\u2019t the way to go for something that was likely unintentional. Either way, Your sister could have been more sympathetic to your feelings though. If my brother had shared the feelings you shared with me, I would have bent over backwards to make sure that he and his fianc\u00e9e felt more love and has more attention. Offered to through you an engagement party or to make the NYE party an engagement party. Not sure why she\u2019s doubling down when it\u2019s not necessary.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I get why most are saying you're an AH or that everybody sucks, I also think that most are completely missing how far along your sister is and how much she is jumping the gun here. Most doctors wait until at least 6 weeks for the first ultrasound and most doctors also recommend not telling ANYONE until 12 weeks (3 months) to ensure the pregnancy is stable and viable. Sure, it's nice to be able to take advantage of having everyone in one place for an announcement like a pregnancy (just like you wanted for your engagement), but your sister is letting her desire for the spotlight override doing what is best.\n\nCompounding it is your brother in law completely ignoring the fact that you're engaged and your sister completely ignoring how you felt, you know that going to the party would only have been more fawning over them and ignoring of you and your fianc\u00e9e.\n\nI think you made the right decision not to go and were right to stand up for your fianc\u00e9e when she was uncomfortable with how things turned out. In the end, you are choosing to create a new family with her and she should generally be a priority over the rest of your family.", "YTA .. but just for the part of pouting that no one's celebrating your announcement.\n\nYou could not have expected the announcement as much as she did not expect your announcement.... \n\nLet's say the order of announcements was reversed ... She went first..  would you have even made your announcement?\n\nAnd if yes, think she'd be reacting this way?\n\nYou ain't happy for her unconditionally from the way I see it", "NTA\n\nObviously the announcements overlapping was just an unfortunate coincidence, but it is lame of everyone to just completely not care about your engagement.", "EHS: you mostly, but your sister and her husband do sound pretty dismissive and like they genuinely don\u2019t care that much. Which is weird, when they\u2019re insisting you care endlessly about their family growth? Idk, this all seems like a lot of pettiness on each end.\n\nAlso if you don\u2019t feel like your sister supports you, it\u2019s also OK to not wanna be around her and to limit or lower contact. **But this post reads like you are simply mad at her because the announcements coincided, when it seems like the real reason is you don\u2019t feel acknowledged as much as she is.** If you\u2019re not close then you also don\u2019t have to show up to these events where in you feel like you\u2019re forced to interact with people you don\u2019t want to anyway.", "Your feelings are understandable. I don't think people read these posts entirely before they go off on some rant. No, neither of you could have known you were going to make life changing announcements at the same time. NAH on that one.\n\nI think what people are missing, is that no one in your family bothered to take notice of the engagement because they were baby happy. Now, I get being happy to have a baby, but like weddings, the world does not stop revolving. IMO the family failed the OP by making them feel that their news didn't warrant any further acknowledgement because...baby.\n\nI also think your sister was a slight AH for not picking up on why you would be upset, and instead of letting you know she heard you, she started shaming you.\n\nYou are NTA for feeling like you do. Have you tried sitting them all down in a room and explaining that they sidelined your news in favor or your sisters? Maybe explain that you are disappointed that they didn't share with you the joy and happiness they so freely placed on your sister, and that it's possible to be happy for two people at once without making one of them feel like an outcast.\n\nSo, I get it and no, I don't think you overreacted. However, take the time to let your family know why and then move on with plans for your wedding.", "Nta granted the timing of both announcements were not the best but your sister and her husband shouldn\u2019t be acting so nonchalant over this \u201chow could I have known everyone was so excited for the baby\u201d when you (going off of context) had clearly told everyone before they announced their pregnancy. Your sister I understand where she is coming from wanting you to be excited for her but telling you \u201cthey\u2019ll be excited for you when it\u2019s time for the wedding\u201d is just sucky.", "INFO: Did she know you were going to propose? I can't decide who is being rude here because firstly I don't know if there was intention to supersede your announcement. I feel like these are two big revelations and at the same moment, it can be a lot to process.\n\nBeyond that, what are the relationships like in your family? Are people fond of your fiancee? Are you a black sheep or is your sister considered the darling of the family? These all matter because maybe there is a bit of family politics coloring the reaction.", "YTA! Congrats on your engagement, but it's not your sister's fault. \nOn a more sarcastic note: I hope you don't plan on getting married 9 months from now...", "NTA.  It would have been NAH because you can\u2019t control your feelings, but the way your BIL acted when you called him pushed him firmly into AH territory. What happened at Christmas was unfortunate, but totally dismissing your feelings is intentional and cruel. You won\u2019t change their minds, but I would talk to your parents about this. Don\u2019t make it a comparison to your sister or you won\u2019t get far, focus on how it\u2019s really been hurting you that no one in your family has taken the time to celebrate or acknowledge your engagement. Maybe you could have an engagement party so you can get a moment to celebrate with your family and friends?", "I'm leaning towards a soft YTA.\nShe didn't upstaged you, no one could have known that you both would make a big announcement the same night. It's just too bad, and the fact that everyone cared more about the baby than your engagement isn't her fault either. I get that you were disappointed though, and your BIL definitely seems like an ass.", "NTA. Initially it was N A H but how your BIL responded when you called him makes them the AHs. \n\nChristmas may have felt like you got tossed to the side after your sisters announcement and I\u2019m sorry that was your experience for you and your fianc\u00e9e. \n\nI appreciate that you decided to just call to decline the New Years invite rather than making a huge dramatic issue.\n\nYour sister and BIL are AH for their response. An engagement is a huge life changing event just like a new baby which shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. \n\nCongrats on your engagement!\n\nEdit: thanks for the kind award!!", "I am somewhat on the fence between ESH and NAH but leaning more to the ESH side. You all would\u2019ve been solid NAH as how would you know your sis was going to announce pregnancy or she know you\u2019re announcing the engagement. Sure it sucks it worked out that way but they weren\u2019t intentionally trying to one up you. \n\nYour feelings of the matter are valid but don\u2019t be angry at your sis. The words afterward between the two sides are what make you guys go into AH territory. You\u2019re looking to pick a fight and while BIL\u2019s wording was probably not ideal, he certainly should\u2019ve been more tactful.", "YTA.  Both of you planned a surprise.  It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that you announced the same day.  What makes you the asshole is pouting because you don\u2019t feel you got the attention you deserve and refusing to attend New Years party.  Grow up.  It\u2019s not a competition.", "YTA since you didn't own the moment and your sister was within her rights to announce her news at a large family gathering too. It's not as if the gathering were in your honor, which would be different.", "YTA. They had just as much right to announce their news as you did. It's not their fault that your family is more excited about a baby than about an engagement. Most people would be.\n\nBe happy that you're engaged. It's something that not everyone gets to experience ever.", "Gonna say YTA\n\nYou decided to pick the family Christmas dinner and gift exchange to propose to your fiance. Your sister opted to do the same thing for her pregnancy announcement.\n\nYou're acting entitled and refusing to share what was literally a group event.\n\nCongrats on the engagement. You definitely come across jealous and insecure not being the sole center of attention.", "You're completely overreacting and you're quite the AH. You saw no problem with making a huge announcement at a Christmas event. And that's just great ... really, I hope you and your fiancee are really happy together. But you seem ticked off that your sister and her husband ALSO chose to make a big life announcement at the same party. She wasn't trying to overshadow you ... in fact, it seems to me that neither of you knew of the other's announcement. Are you suggesting that you can use family events for big news but she can't? Or that she should have taken the ultrasound image back after you announced your engagement? Other people's reactions to these \"competing\" bits of news is not your sister's fault. And as for your BIL accidentally calling your fiancee your gf? Slip of the tongue. Grow up.", "NTA - It baffles me how you\u2019re expected to be happy for everyone but no one\u2019s going to be happy for you because it\u2019s \u201cselfish\u201d.", "Esh, neither of you guys were aware of the other announcement. Your feelings are understandable however directed at wrong people. It should be towards your family not your sister. However your sister took your feelings of no one being excited for you as not being excited for her. When that is not the case.", "ESH. With only older siblings I know that at every step you are overshadowed. Great day in school? Shut up, we heard those stories about grammar school often enough, lets hear some high school stories. Something happening in HS? Shut up, uni stories are more interesting. Uni story? Shut up, sibling is getting married ... And now you have engagement? Shut up baby is more important.  \n\nAnd they are right. And you are right.", "ESH- you for thinking a christmas party is your engagement party and your family for being so excited about your sister's pregnancy they aren't acknowledging your engagement.", "ESH for making a holiday about themselves. Can\u2019t you just all be happy for each other?", "For me it was a clear NAH until your bil made that asshole comment. That weighed it down in your favor. \n\nNTA.", "NTA if the fiancee doesn't wish to go, you don't go! Been married 40 years now and my experience is \" happy wife, happy life.\" Goes for fiancees as well.", "I actually don't think you're the asshole here. It's okay to feel like you and your fiance have been pushed to the side because essentially that's what happened. I mean, to the point where your BIL even forgot ? like damn , that's a real sad feeling for sure. \n\nNAH", "NAH,\n\nI think you are overreacting but I get that it\u2019s because you are hurt because your engagement was literally forgotten with your sisters news. I don\u2019t want to say Y T A for that reason.\n\nYour sister hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nIt's sad that no one will acknowledge your milestone. Of course a baby trumps an engagement but there seems to be 0 excitement to you news.\n\nBut what makes your sister and BIL assholes is how they reacted to you on the phone.", "ESH. It sucks that both announcements were secretly planned on the same day. But it was an honest coincidence so it's really not okay for you to get mad about it. However, it was an asshole  move for your family to completely ignore your big announcement and fawn over your sister the way they did. They should have celebrated you both, and I think it's valid that you and your fiance feel shoved aside by their reaction. Your BIL is an asshole for referring to your fiance as \"girlfriend\" and then basically saying how he forgot you two were engaged. SIL is an asshole for completely dismissing your feelings.", "NAH but just for the poor timing as both OP and his sister could not possibly  know they both plan a big annoucement at the same time. That said, I understand that he can be salty after this night and the following falling out with his. His engagement his not only onvershadowed and even casted aside.", "NAH. Neither of you planned to upstage the other. If it makes you feel any better, I\u2019d have found the engagement news a lot more exciting\ud83d\ude04", "Oooo...tricky.  Leaning towards YTA but a soft one.  If this evening was centered around you and your fianc\u00e9 then it's cut and dry (they'd be totally in the wrong), however, this was a Christmas party where no one specific person was the honored guest.  \n\nIt really sucks that your sister stole the limelight and you are in no way obligated to attend a party where you feel uncomfortable, however, it's important to acknowledge why you're upset and from what you've said, you're upset because you feel you should have gotten at least equal attention to your sister and now feel completely forgotten. That would also hurt my feelings too.\n\n(Gentle) YTA because you've taken something that was not directed at you specifically and turned it into a bigger issue than it should be. I'd let it go and plan an engagement party where all the attention should rightfully be focused on you and your fianc\u00e9. Big congratulations, btw!! :)", "YTA - being pregnant is not overshadowing an engagement.  This is super entitled.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to be upset, you\u2019re allowed to not want to go to the party. They\u2019re allowed to be excited, they\u2019re allowed to be disappointed or upset that you\u2019re not coming to the party. The best thing you can do is continue to be excited for yourself and your sister. Try to move on from this and let it go. What\u2019s done is done and while it sucks, there\u2019s no need to let it come between you and your sister. Maybe throw an engagement party so you can give your fianc\u00e9 the attention that you want her to have.", "YTA. She did literally nothing wrong at any point in your post. \n\nShe didn't know your news, she had the exact same idea as you to announce something when her whole family was gathered. \n\nEveryone in the family cared more about her news than yours, because it's far more exciting news. But that isn't something she did. You can't be mad at her for the reactions of other people to her (far more) exciting news. \n\nWas your BIL at the announcement? Because he should have known if he was there,  and it's mildly insensitive for him to forget. If he wasn't there, then it's really not that major that he forgot.", "A little bit YTA. An engagement is like fiction, whereas a baby is very real. I don't blame people for being more interested in the baby news.", "Yta\n\nThere is more than enough happiness to go around. And honestly I would be upset with the rest of the family more than your sister.\n\nIt's their reaction.  If this is the first grandbaby it's going to be a huge deal.\n\n\nBy not going to the party you are starting a war of sorts. \n\nYou cannot control when other people have life changing events. All you can do is be happy and live your best life. \n\n\nYour fiancee is going to be a member of the family, the last thing she should want is to start off with some petty behavior.  Go and enjoy yourself.", "YTA you don't get to be the only ones that make big announcements at family events. You don't own that right. People will be more excited about a baby naturally, than a wedding. You had a nice moment, but you really wanted the whole night.", "ESH. Yes you are overreacting because sister  didn\u2019t know you were going to announce at Christmas. The party rotates yearly, again not planned around the baby or your engagement. Sister was an AH for being so dismissive and your fianc\u00e9e is an AH for being a bit insecure and childish about the whole ordeal.", "Sorry, YTA.  \n\nIt\u2019s exciting for you to be planning a wedding and intending to get married,  but a first grandchild/child/niece or nephew is going to be more exciting for most people.  This isn\u2019t just making a plan (that truthfully could change) for a wedding at some possibly distant future point, but another human life that is on the way in 8 months.  \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the timing of your announcements worked out the way it did, and you and your fianc\u00e9e can be excited and celebrate your engagement any way you\u2019d like, but you can\u2019t control the level of excitement of others.  Try to put that jealousy aside, it\u2019ll make you crazy.", "Difficult  \nNTA\nBut neither is sis for 80% of this.  She could not have known your announcement as she was focused on her own. She's mounted as much expectation and hype internally for her thing as yall have for yours.  On the basis of announcing her thing when you announced yours. She is NTA. Nor are you.   \n  \nHypothetically: what if it were flipped and no one cared about her baby? What if the story on AITA was that she's acting hurt about not being acknowledged and suddenly skipping out parties because of it? Would that be fair to you? Would you consider her to be unreasonable?   \n  \nPeople aren't assholes for not acknowledging the value of your engagement. They are who they are and it's unfair for you to place expectations on them about how much they should or shouldn't care. True love and closeness isn't a series of rules or transactions. It's what people do for you without obligation.  \n  \nWhat you can do, to serve yourself in this situation, is focus on those that acknowledge the value of your engagement. Lean in when people show love and support. And make do without it when they don't.   \n\nRegarding your emotions: \nYou're being vulnerable to her and she's invalidating those emotions. This is the real transgression. Can't force her to be a better person or nicer. The best thing you can do is communicate that it hurt. Then move on. Should give distance not as a means of retaliation or to send a message, but to protect yourself from being hurt in the future.  \n\nDon't set up a system of \"I expect this from you\", say \"it hurt a bit. I'm getting over it\"", "My guy, it was an engagement announcement, your sister didn\u2019t interrupt the proposal or the wedding. A baby is a bigger deal. Move on.", "YTA. Your sister did absolutely nothing wrong. It's a shame that instead of being excited and happy for your sister you're complaining that you want even more attention.", "You do not hijack other people's events to make announcements. \n\nLet me repeat that: you do *not* hijack other people's events to make announcements. \n\nFamily holidays *can* have a *little* bit more leeway if you are willing to treat it as just sharing some news, and not expecting to be the center of attention. \n\nSo a big ESH for both you and your sister for each trying to make Christmas about *you* and *your* news. \n\nBut an extra Y. T. A. for you because you are acting like a sore loser about it. \n\nYou want to be the center of attention? Great, throw yourselves an engagement party. But don't sulk just because people were more excited about a new baby coming (especially if, as I suspect, this is the first grandbaby and you are the second sibling to get married)", "ESH- You for being some dramatic (your sister is right), your sister for thinking the world revolves around her, your BIL for brushing off your engagement, your family for focusing only on the baby, and your fianc\u00e9 for not being unwilling to go to the NYE party.  I think it sounds like you are ALL suited to each other!", "YTA, did you get engaged to get accolades from your family, or because you love your girlfriend.", "YTA. Are you so needy and so much begging for attention as to not go to a party because they \u201cstole your thunder\u201d?\nGrow up. A pregnancy is far more important than an engagement.", "YTA but softly. Your sister and bil are also kind of assholes, but also softly on their part too.\n\nThe only thing your sister is the asshole about here is maybe her harsh words but even then I'd say lighty for her too.\n\nI'll be honest, your sister didn't upstage you in any way. I know in the comments you said that you understood this and it was a poor choice of words so i'll glosss over that, but you can't upstage something you don't know about. \n\nSo onto my real point. For one, congratulations! No matter my opinion on this post I'm happy regardless and I hope you and your fiances wedding is wonderful :) \n\nI think, and this is coming from someone both childless and fianceless, that the family rather understandably got caught up in what I can assume (?) is the hype of the first grandchild/niece/nephew/etc and while it sucks that your announcement got a bit blindsided it's kind of understandable (?) in the way that one of them is a tangible object that's coming in 8 months and the other is a wonderful and lovely concept that will be brought together in an undisclosed amount of time. \n\nI can only hope that when the edding planning properly starts and it comes closer to the big day the hype will be focused then, as that's where I'd personally look to see some real excitement and engagement at my own, well, engagement. \n\nThat's not to say you and your fiance aren't valid in feeling hurt, but I deinfitely think it's been blown out of propertion on both sides. I hope you get a chance to sit down with your sister, I think you'd regret it more having this become an issue and ruining both events for each other, over reconciling and enjoying your engagement and her pregnancy as a united family :)", "YTA. It sounds like your sister didn\u2019t mean to upstage you since the ultrasound gift was already wrapped before you announced the engagement. Did you expect her to just hide the gift and defer the news she had planned to announce? \n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9e will get plenty of attention as you go through the wedding planning process. There\u2019s lots of good news here, everyone should be happy for each other.", "NTA. And I\u2019ll get crucified for this. \n\nI\u2019m only saying this cause since they are HOSTING the New Year\u2019s party, they could have waited to give you guys your day. Like it wouldn\u2019t have hurt them to let you and your fianc\u00e9 to have your moment, since literally 7 days later they could have had their moment at their party.", "YTA - while you're not required to attend any party (it's an invitation, not a subpoena), refusing to attend because of this was petty.\n\nYou both planned surprises.  Everyone was happy for both of you.  It wasn't like you told your news and then everyone acted like it was NBD and refused to congratulate you or your sister purposely upstaged you.  There's enough happiness for everyone out there - it's not a finite resource.\n\nBut weddings and babies are...different.  No one is going to care as much about your wedding as you and it's not going to be a sustained excitement, even if there had not been a pregnancy announcement happening in the near vicinity.  People will be excited initially, but since they aren't the ones getting married, they just keep on living their lives and get excited as additional wedding events come up (shower, bach parties, the actual wedding day).  It may seem like the baby news cut things short for you (and maybe it did slightly), but you probably would have discovered very shortly that the initial excitement you received was going to be fairly short-lived regardless.  It doesn't mean they aren't happy for you nor does it mean they are \"less happy\" for you than they are your sister - but it's just the kind of news that doesn't impact their lives in the same way and you're not going to see exactly equal responses, even if their happiness is equal.", "NTA definitely wrong timing \nNo one's in the wrong here, if it were reversed and your engagement overshadowed her pregnancy she would've been upset as well. You couldn't have known she was gonna announce that and viceversa.

This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed. This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo I\u2019m a guy and I recently proposed to my fianc\u00e9e about midway through December. We agreed to announce the engagement at the family Christmas party. My sister and her husband, who are both a couple years older than me, are also there. My sister and I have generally always gotten along, although her husband can tend to come off as a little rude at times, but he\u2019s never outright been a dick.\n\nSo we do a little gift exchange, and at the end of it, my fianc\u00e9e and I decide to make our announcement. So I say my piece, and everyone\u2019s excited about it. It was a nice moment that I was proud to have.\n\nThen my sister stands and holds up an unopened gift for our mother. Mom opens it, and it\u2019s a framed ultrasound image showing that my sister is pregnant, about a month along. It\u2019s a happy moment and I was happy to share in it. But after that, the pregnancy was all anyone talked about for the rest of the day, and the days after that. It was like they had completely forgotten about my fianc\u00e9e and I being engaged.\n\nI felt like my fianc\u00e9e had been cast aside. I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene at the party, because I was happy for my sister. Then every day of the following week, all anyone wanted to talk about was the baby.\n\nFinally, New Year\u2019s Eve came along. The party we have for that switches hosts every year, and it\u2019s my sister\u2019s house this time. My fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t want to go to that party because she felt uncomfortable. So I called them, and my brother in law answers. He asked me what was up, and I told him we weren\u2019t going to be able to make it. He tried to change my mind, saying \u201cyou and your girlfriend can come along\u201d. Like he had forgotten, or hadn\u2019t even acknowledged that we were engaged. I reminded him of our engagement, to which he said he couldn\u2019t have known since everyone was so excited about the baby. I hung up on him then, and tried to just move on from it.\n\nThen my sister called and asked me why I was upset about her baby. I told her I wasn\u2019t upset about it. I said it hurt when our family seemed to care more about her baby to the point that my fianc\u00e9e and I being engaged may as well have not happened because no one acknowledged it. She told me to grow up, and said it was selfish of me to avoid coming to a party becuase I was jealous of her happiness. I said that it wasn\u2019t that I was jealous, like I said I\u2019m happy for her that she\u2019s having a baby. But while she\u2019s taking a step in her life, I\u2019m also taking a step in my own life. I\u2019m engaged to a woman that I love and that I am prepared to spend the rest of my life with, and it feels like no one has acknowledged or respected that. Afterwards, she said I was being dramatic and that people would be more than happy to care about it when the wedding happened. Then she said I should quit whining and come to the party. I told her that I didn\u2019t want to go to a party hosted by someone who wouldn\u2019t be as happy for me as I am for her, and I hung up.\n\nSo what do you guys think?

My guess is no, so why not? Is it because people were more excited for her? If so, that isn't her fault, that's just what people were more excited about. \n\nShe didn't do anything intentional here, you both just had plans to announce things at an event that neither of you were in charge of, so both of you just have to deal with it.", "YTA.\n\nOne time, my parents and sister and her now-husband came out to eat with me to celebrate my birthday.  I was planning, while we were all together, to come out to them, and let them know I was dating a woman.\n\nThen, before I got a chance to come out, my sister announced her engagement.  So I didn't say anything for fear of overshadowing her announcement.  But then I suddenly had a ticking time bomb where I had to host another personal get together as soon as possible to get the whole family back in the same room again, because I have to come out to them before I come out to the rest of the family, and I have to come out to the rest of the family soon enough that there's another family event I can attend with my girlfriend before my sister's wedding, because then I'd be making a big scene and overshadowing her wedding.  It was hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not make a major announcement at a family gathering for another purpose if you aren't willing to share the spotlight.  You don't get to call dibs if you didn't throw the party.  You want it to be all about you while your sister shuts up about her pregnancy?  Throw a dinner party on a Tuesday and announce it then.  You've made the event just for this, it's all yours.  But Christmas is for everybody.  Everybody wants to take advantage of the fact that the whole family is together to tell them important things in person.  You don't get to call dibs on Christmas and neither does your sister.", "YTA.

Please realize that no one will be as excited about your engagement and wedding as you and your fianc\u00e9. Excited for you, happy for you\u2026? Yes. But as excited and happy as you two are?

If your fianc\u00e9 is this upset that she feels uncomfortable being around your family now because she feels a baby announcement overshadowed the engagement announcement and took away the spotlight from you two,  I can only imagine how upset she will get if she feels something else overshadows or takes away the spotlight during wedding planning or the actual wedding.

Not everyone waits to tell people - most don't.", "The difference is OP made his announcement first.\n\nSo, if the expectation (and I'm not saying it is here, but it usually is) is one big announcement per event, then the sister should have held off once OP made his engagement announcement.", "I know, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m saying that I, or both of us, could have handled it better. Me especially.", "Thank you.

But people do it all the time. The sister was telling family, not the world. These are the people who you\u2019d want to support you if you do miscarry, which is why I told my family early. But honestly, many people don\u2019t really expect miscarriages with first pregnancies and get too excited to contain it.  It doesn\u2019t matter why people do it. People do do it though and Op\u2019s sister had just as much right to share her news as Op did.", "I have had 2 miscarriages and told people the first time before 12 weeks and i told people the second time before 12 weeks.

Weird that you think otherwise.", "When did I once say that??", "Honestly, I completely missed the fact that it was already a wrapped gift in their presence.\n\nI dunno. If the sister could have removed it stealthily, that might have been a good idea.\n\nAt the very least, though, they (the sister/family) could have actually cared about OPs news, even after the pregnancy announcement.", "He didn't. And I'm not saying he did.\n\nBut generally speaking, when one person makes a big life changing announcement like that, the polite thing to do, IMO, is hold off on your own and let them have their moment.\n\nIt's not that OPs or the sisters announcement was more important than the other, it's just that big announcements like that are deserving of their own moment.", "I\u2019m talking in hindsight here.

On the other hand, it\u2019s a little concerning that you\u2019re angry at all. \n\nWhere would the \u201cappropriate\u201d place for your anger be, in your opinion?

Also the idea of doing NYE with family past 15yo sounds terrible to me in general, plus everyone's allowed to be a little butthurt about something once in a while if they don't harass others over it.

True both sides could learn and plan better and it seems like your mind is made up. \n\nKeep in mind though based on how your sister is acting: If you\u2019re looking for a child free wedding be prepared for pushback from them.

A lot of people think baby trumps wedding I guess? You are perfectly entitled to skip out on a party if you want but I hope you don\u2019t hold onto the resentment because both announcements happening at the same time were accidents.

Neither of them respected your no, and then further made assumptions about things. \n\nWhen you talk to sis, open by asking her what exactly her husband said to her because I bet there's a difference of perspective and he painted the conversation differently on purpose so she would call to convince you to come to the party.", "NTA.

So no one gave two flying squirrels about us, and literally spent the rest of the trip going through baby gear with his sisters and talking about the babies. I was very excited for her obviously but it was a little annoying (especially since I had had to book PTO for this trip, and wouldn\u2019t have done so for a baby prep adventure) and disappointing because we had been told to hold off on celebrating our engagement until we could do it with the out of town family. It was nobody\u2019s fault, just life\u2019s timing.\n\nEveryone kept saying they would focus on our wedding once the babies came but predictably then his whole family said they were too busy helping with the twins to do anything for the wedding.

Inconsiderate yes but he\u2019s also having a baby and the most important thing in his life right now is that baby and your sister. \n\nIt would be a shame to start your engagement off this way by not showing up to this party.

We've been married for almost 28 years.", "It was her mom's Christmas gift.  Is she just supposed to say she forgot them?", "Why? Simply because they beat them to it and planned their announcement earlier in the night? It's a family event; it's the perfect time for family to trade their announcements.

Great!", "This is weird. \n\nBut also, why couldn\u2019t BIL just apologize for forgetting about the engagement?

Both can be important.", "It's not hostile, it's callous because this was legit less than a week after it being announced, and BIL straight blamed the baby announcement for forgetting. So, very easy to be miffed at. OP had already said he wasn't going, the best thing to do was to apologize then move on- this isn't exactly something that can be changed. Sister, however, absolutely should not have called and confronted OP because feeling upset that your family didn't seem as happy for you is kinda a natural reaction and not anyone's fault. Calling and confronting to both dismiss OP's feelings and blame him for having them is pouring gas on a fire, especially when OP was not confronting sister on it. Seriously, all he and his fiancee wanted was a little space for a bit. That's fine.", "Well, but would you defend yourself by saying you couldn't know because your news was more important?

My SIL bachelorette party which I wasn\u2019t invited to, was conveniently scheduled for my 30th birthday. So none of my husbands family attended because they were all busy with wedding stuff. A year later pregnant, more fawning. Then we get engaged, and got married, and the fanfare that we received was the equivalent of a toy trumpet being squeezed one time.  My in laws didn\u2019t even know where we were having the ceremony\u2026  it only gets better from here. I was diagnosed with breast cancer 6 months after we were married and I also found out I was pregnant. It didn\u2019t work out\u2026 they were ok about it, but honestly what happened after I didn\u2019t expect.  She then gets pregnant again, while I\u2019m going through chemo etc. I decided to tell her that I\u2019m happy for her but extremely sad for me, and basically asking her for some kindness and compassion. She was cruel to me and told me my life and my feelings are not her responsibility\u2014but given the prior experiences no one faulted me. At first.  When I lost my marbles from depression and continuing treatment for cancer, my lovely MIL meets us at dinner and proceeds to have a one on one conversation with my SIL belly who was sitting right across from me.

OP I\u2019m sorry that your sister decided to ruin your announcement with a baby announcement. I understand that both should be celebrated but she should\u2019ve let you have this one. At least for another day or two. Like why did she have to ruin your moment in the lime light? She could\u2019ve let you have Christmas and then announced the baby at new years for example. Everyone and their mother knows that a baby announcement trumps anything.

At least you have each other and if the engagement means the world to the two of you then that\u2019s all that matters. And congratulations, I just got married my beautiful husband last night \ud83d\ude01", "Honestly, I think ESH. \n\nI think you and your fianc\u00e9e kinda suck - it reads like you\u2019re putting a lot of anger and blame about this on your sister and it does not belong there. The way everyone else focused on the pregnancy is not on her, and the fact that you framed the title as her overshadowing you indicates that you\u2019re blaming her more than necessary. Additionally, while it\u2019s completely within your rights to not go to the party, I think going and re-announcing your engagement (maybe with your sister\u2019s go-ahead) or consistently referring to your fianc\u00e9e as your fianc\u00e9e might have been a smarter move to remind people of what happened. The way you handled this, I think your family will focus more on what they perceive as childishness on you and your fianc\u00e9es part rather than on the engagement. That doesn\u2019t mean you suck, just that you could\u2019ve handled this better. \n\nWhile I do get that it\u2019s hurtful, I also think your BIL forgetting that you got engaged is a forgivable mistake, considering how much else he has going on as a soon-to-be first time parent. He could and should\u2019ve reacted more gracefully to your reminder and apologized, though, which is why he sucks as well. \n\nYour sister very obviously did not plan to overshadow you or steal your spotlight - considering the ultrasound pic was framed and wrapped, this is clearly something she planned in advance and didn\u2019t decide to do on the spot because she thought \u201cYeah, let\u2019s ruin their moment\u201d. She also didn\u2019t know you were engaged or planning to announce your engagement. Still, she could have handled the situation better by not telling your families immediately after your announcement and instead giving you a bit more time to shine and field questions. Additionally, the fact that either she or her husband turned \u201cI wish people had paid more attention to my engagement\u201d into \u201cyou\u2019re upset about my pregnancy\u201d is a sucky move. Although I get that maybe she feels like she is getting unfairly punished for other people\u2019s actions here, it also sucks that she does not understand why you\u2019re upset and is stating that people will care about you taking a big step in your life once there\u2019s the actual wedding, thus downplaying your engagement. In general, it reads like she\u2019s twisting your words here quite a bit, so she also kinda sucks.\n\nBut I think your other family members suck most. They\u2019re adults, they should be able to focus on, talk and be happy about more than one thing. I do get that the initial excitement about the pregnancy lead to it dominating the conversation on Christmas evening, but they should have kept in mind that you\u2019re engaged to be married and asked you and your fianc\u00e9e about it in the week afterwards.\n\nSo yeah. Y\u2019all could\u2019ve behaved better, but I hope you can figure this out in time to have a really beautiful wedding.

She could have waited and presented her announcement later.. If I was her, I would postpone my announcement to the new year's party, which is literally one week later, leaving that week for the parents to be happy about the couple. Because in this way, even if she announced it later that evening, it would unfortunately overshadow his announcement anyway, as indicated by his whole family obsessing about this afterwards.", "You don\u2019t have to wait to tell people.

The baby is literally not visible.  Hell, I have a scan at 5 weeks 3 days and baby was a tiny dot, that was it.\n\nAlso women should not have to hold off telling because of gestational age.

Maybe he misunderstood and that was the 8 week viability.", "LOL", "He was also there, sitting with my sister", "Yet she\u2019s expected to improvise when he jumped out in front. Presumably you think he should have waited some arbitrary time if he\u2019d been a little slower?", "A Christmas party is big enough for multiple happy announcements. Only assholes think otherwise.", "I would have done the same!", "Exactly. That\u2019s just basic, \u2018not everything is actually all about me Me ME\u2019 decency. \n\nAnd it\u2019s why I say NTA, OP. Both Sis and BIL\u2019s attitudes when you explained your reason for skipping their shindig say that they WERE cool with jacking your moment.", "I just hit 'reply' with the exact same message...sister could have waited.", "Sister had time to get an ultrasound and get it framed, she is clearly farther along than four weeks.", "Most 4 week pregnancy\u2019s don\u2019t have an ultrasound\u2026.even if you have fertility issues, they still usually wait until 6 weeks minimum (even then it is not common).  I had a rash of miscarriages, and at 4 weeks we were repeating blood tests every 2 days, and then ultrasound at 7 weeks.  With the first, they didn\u2019t even want to schedule an appointment until after 8 weeks.", "Well, people can announce a pregnancy whenever they want.", "She said that sister had an unopened gift which means sister always planned on announcing it.", "Um please read OPs update in the comments. I think the main culprit is the BIl and his lack of tact when speaking to people. OP and sister seem to be fine", "That's fair. I mean I guess it depends on the family. When/if my partner and I ready to have kid, I sorta want to put an ultra sound photo as a present mainly because I have a history of infertility (may have been fixed, I don't know until I try for another) and because no one expected my partner to want/have a kid and his parents would love another grandchild.\n\nBut not to overshadow anyone, only because it really would be a surprise, but we'd communicate with other family members just in case.", "Yes I feel like they must have misunderstood. Announcing at 4 weeks is basically they found out a few days ago, right? She must have found our 4 weeks ago and decided to announce now. The dates really do make a difference, I think, in this case.", "If you go to one of those \"hello baby\" places (private \"for fun\" 3d ultrasounds) and tell them you think you are about three months along but dont know for sure, they will do it for $100.  I've had lots of friends do this because they were either unsure how far along they were or KNEW they were only like 6 weeks and wanted the ultrasound pic to make announcements.  She could have for sure gotten one done at that type of place.", "Okay so he must have been engrossed in his moment but like that doesn't mean he needed to be so stupid in responding back. \n\nHonestly you and your sister could have sorted it out yourselves, but your BIL should stay out of communications between the two of you since he's leaving out alot of stuff and is kinda an ass when talking to you. Like i get he is having a kid but like he was there when you announced your engagement not like he wasn't there. I find more issue with his behavior than you or your sister. \n\nI like your update btw very calm and hope you and your sister settle this and move forward.", "A very self-centered gift.", "Hmm, I am 8 years older than my cousin and we both gave birth for the first time, 2,5 months apart. In my culture though, we do not pay this much attention to these things.", "Yup. I had an ultrasound at 4 weeks,1 day, which was a big anomaly and I\u2019m still not sure why my OB\u2019s office scheduled it then. It was too early even to figure out the due date. There was a gestational sac. That\u2019s it. 1 week, 6 days later we found out there were two babies. SURPRISE.", "It actually states his sister held up the unopened gift that she had for their mom... the way it reads, mom didn't even know about the last gift.. I'm assuming that since he mentioned he & fiance made the announcement after gifts that no one knew about the last gift except his sis & bil..", "That's true.   However,  if I was in her shoes,  I would delay my announcement since they all would've gotten together again in a week.   They both deserved to receive attention.   It's unfortunate that OP's family couldn't celebrate both.   The family are truly the AH  in this situation.", "The one month seems to based on OPs assessment of the scan.  You cannot see anything at one month on a scan.  Even at 5.5 weeks, you see barely more than a dot.\nI suspect the sister is further along than op thinks.", "They thought it was over so they made their announcement but sister was holding off to give a surprise gift to their mother which frankly she should have given DURING the gift exchange not after it was done.", "Whoa whoa whoa, where did I condemn anyone?", "The fact that the entire family was very happy to hear the baby news tells me otherwise. Why was this announced self-centered?", "I might have my youngest around the time he has his oldest but I don\u2019t see it happening for awhile.

I had it confused entirely. But I\u2019m gonna leave it as is so people don\u2019t get confused when the post says differently than what everyone else is talking about.", "It's not a heartbeat at 6 weeks, it's just the signal from the electronics being fed back to the monitors. Prior to that point, the cells don't have enough sufficient impedance to reflect the signals.", "My brain got stuck on Group Chat lol", "I was trying to work out if I'd missed that OP or their partner were trans and the GC sister wasn't supportive of the engagement or something", "I'm thinking a combo. Sister could've delayed a day, or even just a couple of hours vefore announcing. \n\nBIL seems like a real piece of work, though.", "I was rereading the post and all of OP\u2019s comments trying to find where he said his sister was a TERF", "If you feel like no one cares about your engagement bc of the pregnancy than you should be mad everyone else.

So yeah, it\u2019s on me.", "I proposed at least two weeks before Christmas, it wasn\u2019t a last second thing. Although, my sister most likely knew about the pregnancy before that. All around, bad timing. But, I called her today, and I\u2019m going over there this weekend. So far it sounds like we\u2019re gonna be ok.", "My fianc\u00e9e caused nothing. It was all on me and how poorly I handled it.", "The same goes for the sister then doesn\u2019t it? If OP shouldn\u2019t have announced his engagement at Christmas then the sister should have waited as well. Also, if it was me and someone else had just made a major announcement, I would wait until the next day at least to announce mine.", "So OP should have planned his own announcement...doesn't that go the same for the sister?  In the spirit of 'recognition', would it have hurt her to quietly tell hubby 'hey...let's do our announcement at New Years'?", "I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. JS\u2026. NTA for me and typically people don\u2019t announce they\u2019re pregnant til 3 months or later since lots of people miscarry before then.", "Well, he forgot they were engaged. Sounds like he either selectively remembers to suit his agenda or he is just legitimately forgetful of \"small\" details", "Agree with you.  My brother announced he and his wife were expecting at the family gathering where I planned to announce husband and I were expecting. \n\nI delayed my announcement and told just my parents privately many hours later so they could have the double excitement but I didn\u2019t draw attention from my bro. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard.", "I agree up until the phone call. There was definitely no way for either of them to know about each other\u2019s surprises, but OP is allowed to be hurt about his sister just dismissing him.", "Actually, seeing those answers I don't thinks so. That really was right on top of your announcement. So she really was stepping on your toes.\n\nBut there have been a lot of posts lately where someone claims someone else deliberately upstaged their \"moment\" when they didn't have a valid claim to stand on. Like the newly engaged woman who was chastised for wearing her engagement to a holiday party because her sister's BF was going to propose.", "Yeah.  It\u2019s not the sister\u2019s fault that she also planned an announcement or how everybody else reacted. But she and the BIL also minimised the engagement. Imagine if somebody said to them - what need to be excited about being pregnant, we\u2019ll just wait until the baby comes.  Sure the wedding and birth will be MORE exciting than their respective announcements, but it doesn\u2019t mean people should be excited equally about the prospect.", "Exactly! Great comment.", "I agree. If you make an announcement at an event that you didn't plan and that is specifically for something else, you can't then be upset if someone else does the same, or if people are more focused on the actual reason for the event, in this case Christmas. And BIL's comment was shitty but likely provoked by OP having a strop about having to share the spotlight. So it's a big ESH from me.", "\u2764\ufe0f Throw yourselves a little engagement party and give yourselves the moment you wanted.", "Nah, dw about it. Most people will see your update!", "That's what I was thinking.", "Neither of one of them is an AH for making their announcement at the party. You\u2019re right, OP screwed up her announcement as much as she screwed up his, because they both chose the same time and place to announce it. Neither one could have known what the other was planning. However the family is definitely an AH for being incapable of celebrating two people At once, and I think the sis and BIL can get an AH vote too for essentially saying \u201cwell obviously the baby is more important, so you can\u2019t expect us to remember your news.\u201d What could\u2019ve been a fun day for everyone and a bit of \u201comg we\u2019re so alike we had the same plans\u201d turned into a competition for love/attention.", "Sure, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t put a modicum of effort into being happy for two people (couples) at once. And to flat out say \u201cwell your news isn\u2019t as important so why should I have remembered\u201d is such an AH statement. Just because families are often more excited for babies doesn\u2019t mean they can completely dismiss non-baby news and not be called AH.", "When I got engaged most family members gave a hug, asked to see the ring, how he proposed, photos if possible, and maybe discussed plans on dates or ideas for the wedding. Like I\u2019m not saying we had multiple hour conversations but it was definitely more fun and interactive than \u201cwhat a pretty ring!\u201d And then complete subject change. Not to mention the BIL told op that he couldn\u2019t be expected to even *remember* the engagement because of the baby. Yeah, that\u2019s definitely AH-y.", "I mean, I think most people would have played it by ear and waited to announce a different day? It\u2019s generally considered a social faux pas to upstage a major life announcement with your own life announcement, intentionally or not.", "And in this case she told her immediate family at Christmas and you called that premature and strange. I don\u2019t find it strange at all", "Yes, but why not wait a couple of hours at least just so OP could enjoy his and his fianc\u00e8s moment for just a little bit?", "I get you, lol.  Announcement for 1 at a family gathering.  Announcement for 2 via snail mail because I didn't have the energy to do all the phone calls and there were no events coming up (and we lived in multiple states at that point)", "Pretty sure 4 weeks is either an assumption or a fib.", "Try re reading the post. That is what not happened in that conversation.", "What's the point of any announcement but to draw attention to that which you are announcing?  If it is self-centered to want that attention, all announcements are self centered, including the pregnancy announcement immediately after.", "Lol that's such a ridiculous argument. There's obviously a huge difference between \"we're engaged\" and \"dad just fucking *died* right in front of us!\" haha.\n\nAnd as someone else pointed out, \"a Christmas party is big enough for multiple happy announcements. Only assholes think otherwise\".

Your sister\u2019s pregnancy didn\u2019t cease to exist after the announcement, and I doubt you want to wait until that baby graduates college to announce your own big life milestone lol \n\nYou\u2019re handling this wonderfully! It sucks your family can\u2019t be happy for you, but you\u2019ve got a whole metric ton of internet strangers who are very excited for you\u2014congratulations to you and your fianc\u00e9! Enjoy this period in life :)", "It doesn't even take years of psychological damage. It's as simple as the same reason you don't propose at someone else's wedding. Let the person/couple have their moment in the spotlight.\n\nOP's sister is an asshole. She knew she was hosting New Years and everyone would be there, so once OP made his announcement she should have respected him enough to postpone her own announcement by a week.\n\nShe's also only a month along as well, which is pretty damn early to make an announcement.", ">Mu question is why, after he made his announcement, did she not just wait to make hers? \n\nBecause she had it planned as her gift to her mom?\n\nWhy should she not do what she planned just because brother made an announcement?", "Or even waited until just before dessert, so at least some time would be spent on OP.", "So it seems deliberate - there was a gift exchange and at the end of it OP announced his news.\n\nAfter his announcement his sister took a leftover gift and made her grand announcement. \n\nThe order is strange to me. Should the gift be received already?", "The announcement was wrapped as a Christmas present for her mother. She wouldn't have had a present for her mom I guess.", "Great point. Yup, that makes sister and BIL the AH", "Yeah, how did they get an ultrasound ? My doc was desperately trying to see the location when I was 4 weeks (history of endometriosis and stuff so they wanted to rule out ectopic) but we could only see the gestational sac by week 5. Not before that !", "The only people who don\u2019t genuinely announce pregnancy until like 12 weeks are high risk women, women who\u2019ve lost babies before and women who are anxious about losing it but other than that it\u2019s okay to announce it whenever \n\nI announced when I found out at 9 weeks.\n\nBut I think a baby is way more exciting than an engagement.", "Wouldn't people notice she had a gift she was about to give that she then took back?  The sister obviously had it all planned out to be during the gift exchange and waiting would have been weird if anyone spotted it (though OP doesn't say whether they did or not).", "Considering it was on the verge on their baby announcement, it's understandable that he forgot or hasn't paid attention to your announcement and simply put his foot in his mouth when he tried justifying himself.  \n\n\nIn any case, congrats to you all !", "You were right.

They had all night", "I think it\u2019s plausible she held back the gift to make sure it was the last thing opened, but I\u2019m with those who think it would have been kind of the sister to wait and let OP and his fianc\u00e9e have their moment.", "I had one at 5 weeks, but that's because I was bleeding and there was a reason to check.  They couldn't even see yet if there was a baby there, just a gestational sac.", "Yeah they were handing out gifts and her sister had wrapped this up in advance.

Everyone was celebrated. \n\nAnd then in the year we had our kid, he also got three new cousins.\n\nWhen you have two gigantic families, there\u2019s always multiple big life events going on.

They have doubled down that they are self centered and your milestones don\u2019t matter (have to wonder how their engagement announcement was received).  I would recommend, however, watching the timing of your wedding activities.  I can just see bridal shower is gender reveal, and your wedding will be constantly revamped to accommodate either very pregnant or new mom.  \nI hope that at least some of your family has reached out, and also hope your fianc\u00e9e has a better family", "NTA. Neither of you are the AH really but their response was extremely tone deaf, especially brother in law. She had no idea you were going to announce it and you had no idea she was either, and it\u2019s not her fault people reacted the way they did. But she could have put some effort into being more empathetic towards the situation, and she\u2019s definitely the AH for that. Her and her husband. \nIt\u2019s just an upsetting situation. I suggest doing the wedding after she has the baby though!!!!", "Nta, she knows she doesn't care about your engagement and confirmed it when she said people will care when you get married.", "NTA because of the second half of your post.

I wouldn't go to their party after that comment.", "NTA", "NTA, because when they went to announce their engagement, the sister then held up a gift for their mother of her ultrasound. Then, everyone proceeded to talk about the baby and forget what was supposed to be a happy moment OP. I think that was wrong of the sister for what she did then everyone turning their attention to her baby. His fiancee then felt uncomfortable and cast aside, so no, OP is NTA for not wanting to attend his siter's NY's party.  \n\n\nThen again this is my opinion.", "NTA. Your sister did that AFTER you announced your engagement. I\u2019d say she should have kept it inside until the New Year\u2019s party to let you have your moment at Christmas. I\u2019m sorry that she\u2019s such a selfish a-hole. Congrats on your engagement btw. \u2764\ufe0f", "You seem like a great and level headed dude. You will make a fine husband, uncle and father. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to feel slighted, but ultimately family\u2019s love is not finite. Your sister\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t take away happiness and excitement from you, just adds to it but in somewhat distracting way. NTA, but you shouldn\u2019t take offense even though I see why you feel slighted.", "NTA BUT- this is why people have their own event to announce big news. I agree with other posters. When I got engaged, both sets of parents were there, but that was my husbands choice- we had planned on calling our parents immediately after the proposal to tell them as both sets knew it was happening. Then we made a list of people we had to call before we made a big announcement. I understand you assumed everyone would be together at Christmas so this would be a good time, but I would\u2019ve definitely told parents and siblings before the big announcement and let them know your plans, or planned a special dinner at Christmas that you hosted and made your announcement. Likewise, your sister should\u2019ve done the same- I\u2019ve personally seen so much family drama and rifts happen because of poorly handled announcements- when you don\u2019t share with anyone ahead of time, you run the risk of having your spotlight taken away or things going wrong. You rolled that dice and so did you sister.\n\nYour family is TAH because they should be capable of being more excited about multiple things, especially your parents. I can understand how a baby announcement would over shadow an engagement - a new life tends to trump anything else. So your sister is TAH for not waiting with her own announcement once she heard yours. She should\u2019ve pulled you aside after, congratulated you and explained her situation. She should\u2019ve waited for a different moment in the celebration or even a different day- assuming that wasn\u2019t possible, she should\u2019ve given you a heads up. But that\u2019s neither here nor there. It happened because of poor planning and communication on both you and your sisters parts.\n\nThe real issue and real AH is the BIL and family for being so forgetful and dismissive of your own happiness. You\u2019re right that there\u2019s room in everyone\u2019s hearts for happiness for both of you- and your sister should get that.\n\nI may get slack for this but a baby is bigger than an engagement\u2026 and a baby will always overshadow anything else. But people who love you should have enough capacity to celebrate both. That being said, you need to let this go or it will fester and create a rift and drama around your wedding and the birth of your niece or nephew. Chalk it up to poor planning and learn your lesson for the future. Move on so you can all continue to enjoy the happiness that comes with these life changes", "NTA Op\u2026 But this does feel like the beginnings of an elopement \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. Your family are AH's for immediately acting like your engagement announcement didn't just happen. Your sister and BIL are AH for what they said in the phone calls afterward.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get how some people are saying your the a.h. You told everyone that you and your gf are now engaged. Then your sister literally right after gave a gift to your mom to say that she is pregnant. Your sister did overshadow your engagement. She could have waited like an hour or so to give your mom the gift and say the announcement or even waited for the New Year\u2019s party. Your sister is the AH for saying your jealous. You are allowed to celebrate being engaged. You have a right to be upset with your sister and bil to not even acknowledge your engagement. I\u2019m guessing if your sister announced first then you would have waited right? I would haven\u2019t gone either to the NyE party it clearly shows your sister doesn\u2019t care about your feeling. It seems to me that your sister is almost like the golden child and has to be center of attention. I mean neither of you knew both were going to announce big news but your sister certainly overshadowed your engagement and clearly didn\u2019t care about your feelings but that is me. An Engagement is just as big a pregnancy announcement.", "The only A-H is the brother-in-law", "NTA.\n\nYou overreacted a bit. Neither of you could have known the other had an announcement ahead of time. I was ready for you to be the asshole until the phone calls. \n\nYour BIL can absolutely be expected to remember that you got engaged. Your sister can absolutely be expected to give your life events even a modest acknowledgement. You are not selfish or entitled for expecting these things.", "NTA but mostly because 1. You didn't say why you weren't going until prodded for an answer and still reiterated you're happy about the baby and 2. BIL and sister's conversations alone make them the bad guys. BIL could not have possibly forgotten already that she's fiancee and not girlfriend and that he \"couldn't have known because everyone's excited about the baby\". Wow, I must be a genius to be excited for my favorite shows and events and still remember people and things around me, huh? And your sister saying you were jealous when that wasn't the reason at all.\n\nI will say, though, she didn't purposefully upstage you, you had the unfortunate luck of presenting smaller news first than your sister's bigger news (that's not a dig, I just think engagement interest only involves the announcement, wedding planning, then wedding, and after that will only be interesting to the couple with events like honeymoon and anniversaries, but a baby will continue to have milestones for longer than that.)", "Nta, brother in law sounds like an ass", "NTA, but this is really dumb.", "NTA. I was not sure how I felt about this situation until the conversation with sister and BIL went on New Years. Like obviously neither one of you would have known about the others announcement, but BIL's comment was really rude and sister didn't do much better to try and make him feel better and get him to come.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister perfectly illustrates the issue with your family.

Maybe a minute and a half total?\n\nAnnouncing at the same event, that's just coincidence, this timing however  makes your sister totally TA. She should have waited. Enough for you to enjoy your moment. 30 minutes at least. Maybe wait till NYE.  The way she did it, you have every right to be annoyed about it.\n\nI see that you have apologized to her, but frankly this requires an apology from her to you two. Has she apologized for ruining your announcement with her self centered timing?", "Exactly, it wouldn't have mattered how long she waited on that day. The announcement would have 'stolen' the attention from the OP and the reaction would be exactly the same.", "Same. I have a friend whose sisters were expecting a baby and one getting married and you know how the family celebrated it? By saying, \"We are growing in two different ways this year. X is having a baby and Y is getting married. That means we will get a new baby and a new son. So excited to see my kids celebrating two important milestones.\"", "Some families aren\u2019t able to be happy for 2 people my 21st birthday happened during June 2020 so major covid my in-laws said come over it will just be the 5 of us all not working quarantined and we will have dinner and drinks. I was excited sil showed up announced her pregnancy with tshirts didnt include me in the shirts and then no one even sang me happy birthday. They legit forgot. I left", "That comment has no business....making me ugly laugh. It just did!! I have tears of laughter. Yes I know I'm British but no sarcasm here honest mate it just hit my funny bone and I have no one to share it with so please take my poor comedy gold \ud83e\udd47 award.", "Is it normal that your sister is the center of attention in your family and you play second fiddle and get ignored, or was this a one off? \n\nI find it quite narcistic to steal your moment by announcing within minutes of you, and then to call you dramatic for being rightfully annoyed.\n\nGood you made peace, but keep an eye on it and stand up for your fianc\u00e9e if necessary in the future."]}
