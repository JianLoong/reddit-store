We agreed to announce the engagement at the family Christmas party. My sister and her husband, who are both a couple years older than me, are also there. My sister and I have generally always gotten along, although her husband can tend to come off as a little rude at times, but he\u2019s never outright been a dick.\n\nSo we do a little gift exchange, and at the end of it, my fianc\u00e9e and I decide to make our announcement. So I say my piece, and everyone\u2019s excited about it. It was a nice moment that I was proud to have.\n\nThen my sister stands and holds up an unopened gift for our mother. Mom opens it, and it\u2019s a framed ultrasound image showing that my sister is pregnant, about a month along. It\u2019s a happy moment and I was happy to share in it. But after that, the pregnancy was all anyone talked about for the rest of the day, and the days after that. It was like they had completely forgotten about my fianc\u00e9e and I being engaged.\n\nI felt like my fianc\u00e9e had been cast aside. I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene at the party, because I was happy for my sister. Then every day of the following week, all anyone wanted to talk about was the baby.\n\nFinally, New Year\u2019s Eve came along. The party we have for that switches hosts every year, and it\u2019s my sister\u2019s house this time. My fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t want to go to that party because she felt uncomfortable. So I called them, and my brother in law answers. He asked me what was up, and I told him we weren\u2019t going to be able to make it. He tried to change my mind, saying \u201cyou and your girlfriend can come along\u201d. Like he had forgotten, or hadn\u2019t even acknowledged that we were engaged. I reminded him of our engagement, to which he said he couldn\u2019t have known since everyone was so excited about the baby. I hung up on him then, and tried to just move on from it.\n\nThen my sister called and asked me why I was upset about her baby. I told her I wasn\u2019t upset about it. I said it hurt when our family seemed to care more about her baby to the point that my fianc\u00e9e and I being engaged may as well have not happened because no one acknowledged it. She told me to grow up, and said it was selfish of me to avoid coming to a party becuase I was jealous of her happiness. I said that it wasn\u2019t that I was jealous, like I said I\u2019m happy for her that she\u2019s having a baby. But while she\u2019s taking a step in her life, I\u2019m also taking a step in my own life. I\u2019m engaged to a woman that I love and that I am prepared to spend the rest of my life with, and it feels like no one has acknowledged or respected that. Afterwards, she said I was being dramatic and that people would be more than happy to care about it when the wedding happened. Then she said I should quit whining and come to the party. I told her that I didn\u2019t want to go to a party hosted by someone who wouldn\u2019t be as happy for me as I am for her, and I hung up.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Am I overreacting?", "created_utc": 1672850170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10380zr/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_sisters_nys/", "score": 155, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should have waited to let you have your moment and then given your mother the gift.  She also should have announced that she didn\u2019t know you were announcing your engagement and didn\u2019t want to compete but we had the same idea and here mom, we have 1 more gift for you.  \n\nI think you should also tell her what BIL said on the phone as evidence that she overshadowed you to the point that he couldn\u2019t remember.  \n\nAs a compromise ask if she can have a special toast or announcement for you guys so you can get some of that attention.", "YTA.\n\nYour sister made no effort to overshadow your engagement.  She had the framed ultrasound wrapped up as a gift before you even made your announcement in front of the family.  The overshadowing was just your family\u2019s naturally greater excitement over the pregnancy.  You\u2019ve got no right to be salty over this.  Grow up and be happy for your sister.", "NAH It's an unfortunate situation. It is fair for you to feel upset that your engagement is not getting the attention it deserves. However if you think missing your sisters party will get things back on track then I fear you may be mistaken. This is more likely to cause a bigger rift between you. You may need to decide is your engagement news more important to you than your relationship with your sister", "I can\u2019t decide between NAH or E S H here, so I\u2019ll err on the side of the positive. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re blaming your sister for announcing her pregnancy at Christmas\u2026just that you\u2019re upset that no one in the family really acknowledged your big news after her announcement. I understand how this would hurt your feelings. Refusing to go to her NYE party seems more like a punishment though\u2026which (if so) isn\u2019t the way to go for something that was likely unintentional. Either way, Your sister could have been more sympathetic to your feelings though. If my brother had shared the feelings you shared with me, I would have bent over backwards to make sure that he and his fianc\u00e9e felt more love and has more attention. Offered to through you an engagement party or to make the NYE party an engagement party. Not sure why she\u2019s doubling down when it\u2019s not necessary.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I get why most are saying you're an AH or that everybody sucks, I also think that most are completely missing how far along your sister is and how much she is jumping the gun here. Most doctors wait until at least 6 weeks for the first ultrasound and most doctors also recommend not telling ANYONE until 12 weeks (3 months) to ensure the pregnancy is stable and viable. Sure, it's nice to be able to take advantage of having everyone in one place for an announcement like a pregnancy (just like you wanted for your engagement), but your sister is letting her desire for the spotlight override doing what is best.\n\nCompounding it is your brother in law completely ignoring the fact that you're engaged and your sister completely ignoring how you felt, you know that going to the party would only have been more fawning over them and ignoring of you and your fianc\u00e9e.\n\nI think you made the right decision not to go and were right to stand up for your fianc\u00e9e when she was uncomfortable with how things turned out. In the end, you are choosing to create a new family with her and she should generally be a priority over the rest of your family.", "YTA .. but just for the part of pouting that no one's celebrating your announcement.\n\nYou could not have expected the announcement as much as she did not expect your announcement.... \n\nLet's say the order of announcements was reversed ... She went first..  would you have even made your announcement?\n\nAnd if yes, think she'd be reacting this way?\n\nYou ain't happy for her unconditionally from the way I see it", "NTA\n\nObviously the announcements overlapping was just an unfortunate coincidence, but it is lame of everyone to just completely not care about your engagement.", "EHS: you mostly, but your sister and her husband do sound pretty dismissive and like they genuinely don\u2019t care that much. Which is weird, when they\u2019re insisting you care endlessly about their family growth? Idk, this all seems like a lot of pettiness on each end.\n\nAlso if you don\u2019t feel like your sister supports you, it\u2019s also OK to not wanna be around her and to limit or lower contact. **But this post reads like you are simply mad at her because the announcements coincided, when it seems like the real reason is you don\u2019t feel acknowledged as much as she is.** If you\u2019re not close then you also don\u2019t have to show up to these events where in you feel like you\u2019re forced to interact with people you don\u2019t want to anyway.", "Your feelings are understandable. I don't think people read these posts entirely before they go off on some rant. No, neither of you could have known you were going to make life changing announcements at the same time. NAH on that one.\n\nI think what people are missing, is that no one in your family bothered to take notice of the engagement because they were baby happy. Now, I get being happy to have a baby, but like weddings, the world does not stop revolving. IMO the family failed the OP by making them feel that their news didn't warrant any further acknowledgement because...baby.\n\nI also think your sister was a slight AH for not picking up on why you would be upset, and instead of letting you know she heard you, she started shaming you.\n\nYou are NTA for feeling like you do. Have you tried sitting them all down in a room and explaining that they sidelined your news in favor or your sisters? Maybe explain that you are disappointed that they didn't share with you the joy and happiness they so freely placed on your sister, and that it's possible to be happy for two people at once without making one of them feel like an outcast.\n\nSo, I get it and no, I don't think you overreacted. However, take the time to let your family know why and then move on with plans for your wedding.", "Nta granted the timing of both announcements were not the best but your sister and her husband shouldn\u2019t be acting so nonchalant over this \u201chow could I have known everyone was so excited for the baby\u201d when you (going off of context) had clearly told everyone before they announced their pregnancy. Your sister I understand where she is coming from wanting you to be excited for her but telling you \u201cthey\u2019ll be excited for you when it\u2019s time for the wedding\u201d is just sucky.", "INFO: Did she know you were going to propose? I can't decide who is being rude here because firstly I don't know if there was intention to supersede your announcement. I feel like these are two big revelations and at the same moment, it can be a lot to process.\n\nBeyond that, what are the relationships like in your family? Are people fond of your fiancee? Are you a black sheep or is your sister considered the darling of the family? These all matter because maybe there is a bit of family politics coloring the reaction.", "YTA! Congrats on your engagement, but it's not your sister's fault. \nOn a more sarcastic note: I hope you don't plan on getting married 9 months from now...", "NTA.  It would have been NAH because you can\u2019t control your feelings, but the way your BIL acted when you called him pushed him firmly into AH territory. What happened at Christmas was unfortunate, but totally dismissing your feelings is intentional and cruel. You won\u2019t change their minds, but I would talk to your parents about this. Don\u2019t make it a comparison to your sister or you won\u2019t get far, focus on how it\u2019s really been hurting you that no one in your family has taken the time to celebrate or acknowledge your engagement. Maybe you could have an engagement party so you can get a moment to celebrate with your family and friends?", "I'm leaning towards a soft YTA.\nShe didn't upstaged you, no one could have known that you both would make a big announcement the same night. It's just too bad, and the fact that everyone cared more about the baby than your engagement isn't her fault either. I get that you were disappointed though, and your BIL definitely seems like an ass.", "NTA. Initially it was N A H but how your BIL responded when you called him makes them the AHs. \n\nChristmas may have felt like you got tossed to the side after your sisters announcement and I\u2019m sorry that was your experience for you and your fianc\u00e9e. \n\nI appreciate that you decided to just call to decline the New Years invite rather than making a huge dramatic issue.\n\nYour sister and BIL are AH for their response. An engagement is a huge life changing event just like a new baby which shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. \n\nCongrats on your engagement!\n\nEdit: thanks for the kind award!!", "I am somewhat on the fence between ESH and NAH but leaning more to the ESH side. You all would\u2019ve been solid NAH as how would you know your sis was going to announce pregnancy or she know you\u2019re announcing the engagement. Sure it sucks it worked out that way but they weren\u2019t intentionally trying to one up you. \n\nYour feelings of the matter are valid but don\u2019t be angry at your sis. The words afterward between the two sides are what make you guys go into AH territory. You\u2019re looking to pick a fight and while BIL\u2019s wording was probably not ideal, he certainly should\u2019ve been more tactful.", "YTA.  Both of you planned a surprise.  It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that you announced the same day.  What makes you the asshole is pouting because you don\u2019t feel you got the attention you deserve and refusing to attend New Years party.  Grow up.  It\u2019s not a competition.", "YTA since you didn't own the moment and your sister was within her rights to announce her news at a large family gathering too. It's not as if the gathering were in your honor, which would be different.", "YTA. They had just as much right to announce their news as you did. It's not their fault that your family is more excited about a baby than about an engagement. Most people would be.\n\nBe happy that you're engaged. It's something that not everyone gets to experience ever.", "Gonna say YTA\n\nYou decided to pick the family Christmas dinner and gift exchange to propose to your fiance. Your sister opted to do the same thing for her pregnancy announcement.\n\nYou're acting entitled and refusing to share what was literally a group event.\n\nCongrats on the engagement. You definitely come across jealous and insecure not being the sole center of attention.", "You're completely overreacting and you're quite the AH. You saw no problem with making a huge announcement at a Christmas event. And that's just great ... really, I hope you and your fiancee are really happy together. But you seem ticked off that your sister and her husband ALSO chose to make a big life announcement at the same party. She wasn't trying to overshadow you ... in fact, it seems to me that neither of you knew of the other's announcement. Are you suggesting that you can use family events for big news but she can't? Or that she should have taken the ultrasound image back after you announced your engagement? Other people's reactions to these \"competing\" bits of news is not your sister's fault. And as for your BIL accidentally calling your fiancee your gf? Slip of the tongue. Grow up.", "NTA - It baffles me how you\u2019re expected to be happy for everyone but no one\u2019s going to be happy for you because it\u2019s \u201cselfish\u201d.", "Esh, neither of you guys were aware of the other announcement. Your feelings are understandable however directed at wrong people. It should be towards your family not your sister. However your sister took your feelings of no one being excited for you as not being excited for her. When that is not the case.", "ESH. With only older siblings I know that at every step you are overshadowed. Great day in school? Shut up, we heard those stories about grammar school often enough, lets hear some high school stories. Something happening in HS? Shut up, uni stories are more interesting. Uni story? Shut up, sibling is getting married ... And now you have engagement? Shut up baby is more important.  \n\nAnd they are right. And you are right.", "ESH- you for thinking a christmas party is your engagement party and your family for being so excited about your sister's pregnancy they aren't acknowledging your engagement.", "ESH for making a holiday about themselves. Can\u2019t you just all be happy for each other?", "For me it was a clear NAH until your bil made that asshole comment. That weighed it down in your favor. \n\nNTA.", "NTA if the fiancee doesn't wish to go, you don't go! Been married 40 years now and my experience is \" happy wife, happy life.\" Goes for fiancees as well.", "I actually don't think you're the asshole here. It's okay to feel like you and your fiance have been pushed to the side because essentially that's what happened. I mean, to the point where your BIL even forgot ? like damn , that's a real sad feeling for sure. \n\nNAH", "NAH,\n\nI think you are overreacting but I get that it\u2019s because you are hurt because your engagement was literally forgotten with your sisters news. I don\u2019t want to say Y T A for that reason.\n\nYour sister hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nIt's sad that no one will acknowledge your milestone. Of course a baby trumps an engagement but there seems to be 0 excitement to you news.\n\nBut what makes your sister and BIL assholes is how they reacted to you on the phone.", "ESH. It sucks that both announcements were secretly planned on the same day. But it was an honest coincidence so it's really not okay for you to get mad about it. However, it was an asshole  move for your family to completely ignore your big announcement and fawn over your sister the way they did. They should have celebrated you both, and I think it's valid that you and your fiance feel shoved aside by their reaction. Your BIL is an asshole for referring to your fiance as \"girlfriend\" and then basically saying how he forgot you two were engaged. SIL is an asshole for completely dismissing your feelings.", "NAH but just for the poor timing as both OP and his sister could not possibly  know they both plan a big annoucement at the same time. That said, I understand that he can be salty after this night and the following falling out with his. His engagement his not only onvershadowed and even casted aside.", "NAH. Neither of you planned to upstage the other. If it makes you feel any better, I\u2019d have found the engagement news a lot more exciting\ud83d\ude04", "Oooo...tricky.  Leaning towards YTA but a soft one.  If this evening was centered around you and your fianc\u00e9 then it's cut and dry (they'd be totally in the wrong), however, this was a Christmas party where no one specific person was the honored guest.  \n\nIt really sucks that your sister stole the limelight and you are in no way obligated to attend a party where you feel uncomfortable, however, it's important to acknowledge why you're upset and from what you've said, you're upset because you feel you should have gotten at least equal attention to your sister and now feel completely forgotten. That would also hurt my feelings too.\n\n(Gentle) YTA because you've taken something that was not directed at you specifically and turned it into a bigger issue than it should be. I'd let it go and plan an engagement party where all the attention should rightfully be focused on you and your fianc\u00e9. Big congratulations, btw!! :)", "YTA - being pregnant is not overshadowing an engagement.  This is super entitled.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to be upset, you\u2019re allowed to not want to go to the party. They\u2019re allowed to be excited, they\u2019re allowed to be disappointed or upset that you\u2019re not coming to the party. The best thing you can do is continue to be excited for yourself and your sister. Try to move on from this and let it go. What\u2019s done is done and while it sucks, there\u2019s no need to let it come between you and your sister. Maybe throw an engagement party so you can give your fianc\u00e9 the attention that you want her to have.", "YTA. She did literally nothing wrong at any point in your post. \n\nShe didn't know your news, she had the exact same idea as you to announce something when her whole family was gathered. \n\nEveryone in the family cared more about her news than yours, because it's far more exciting news. But that isn't something she did. You can't be mad at her for the reactions of other people to her (far more) exciting news. \n\nWas your BIL at the announcement? Because he should have known if he was there,  and it's mildly insensitive for him to forget. If he wasn't there, then it's really not that major that he forgot.", "A little bit YTA. An engagement is like fiction, whereas a baby is very real. I don't blame people for being more interested in the baby news.", "Yta\n\nThere is more than enough happiness to go around. And honestly I would be upset with the rest of the family more than your sister.\n\nIt's their reaction.  If this is the first grandbaby it's going to be a huge deal.\n\n\nBy not going to the party you are starting a war of sorts. \n\nYou cannot control when other people have life changing events. All you can do is be happy and live your best life. \n\n\nYour fiancee is going to be a member of the family, the last thing she should want is to start off with some petty behavior.  Go and enjoy yourself.", "YTA you don't get to be the only ones that make big announcements at family events. You don't own that right. People will be more excited about a baby naturally, than a wedding. You had a nice moment, but you really wanted the whole night.", "ESH. Yes you are overreacting because sister  didn\u2019t know you were going to announce at Christmas. The party rotates yearly, again not planned around the baby or your engagement. Sister was an AH for being so dismissive and your fianc\u00e9e is an AH for being a bit insecure and childish about the whole ordeal.", "Sorry, YTA.  \n\nIt\u2019s exciting for you to be planning a wedding and intending to get married,  but a first grandchild/child/niece or nephew is going to be more exciting for most people.  This isn\u2019t just making a plan (that truthfully could change) for a wedding at some possibly distant future point, but another human life that is on the way in 8 months.  \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the timing of your announcements worked out the way it did, and you and your fianc\u00e9e can be excited and celebrate your engagement any way you\u2019d like, but you can\u2019t control the level of excitement of others.  Try to put that jealousy aside, it\u2019ll make you crazy.", "Difficult  \nNTA\nBut neither is sis for 80% of this.  She could not have known your announcement as she was focused on her own. She's mounted as much expectation and hype internally for her thing as yall have for yours.  On the basis of announcing her thing when you announced yours. She is NTA. Nor are you.   \n  \nHypothetically: what if it were flipped and no one cared about her baby? What if the story on AITA was that she's acting hurt about not being acknowledged and suddenly skipping out parties because of it? Would that be fair to you? Would you consider her to be unreasonable?   \n  \nPeople aren't assholes for not acknowledging the value of your engagement. They are who they are and it's unfair for you to place expectations on them about how much they should or shouldn't care. True love and closeness isn't a series of rules or transactions. It's what people do for you without obligation.  \n  \nWhat you can do, to serve yourself in this situation, is focus on those that acknowledge the value of your engagement. Lean in when people show love and support. And make do without it when they don't.   \n\nRegarding your emotions: \nYou're being vulnerable to her and she's invalidating those emotions. This is the real transgression. Can't force her to be a better person or nicer. The best thing you can do is communicate that it hurt. Then move on. Should give distance not as a means of retaliation or to send a message, but to protect yourself from being hurt in the future.  \n\nDon't set up a system of \"I expect this from you\", say \"it hurt a bit. I'm getting over it\"", "My guy, it was an engagement announcement, your sister didn\u2019t interrupt the proposal or the wedding. A baby is a bigger deal. Move on.", "YTA. Your sister did absolutely nothing wrong. It's a shame that instead of being excited and happy for your sister you're complaining that you want even more attention.", "You do not hijack other people's events to make announcements. \n\nLet me repeat that: you do *not* hijack other people's events to make announcements. \n\nFamily holidays *can* have a *little* bit more leeway if you are willing to treat it as just sharing some news, and not expecting to be the center of attention. \n\nSo a big ESH for both you and your sister for each trying to make Christmas about *you* and *your* news. \n\nBut an extra Y. T. A. for you because you are acting like a sore loser about it. \n\nYou want to be the center of attention? Great, throw yourselves an engagement party. But don't sulk just because people were more excited about a new baby coming (especially if, as I suspect, this is the first grandbaby and you are the second sibling to get married)", "ESH- You for being some dramatic (your sister is right), your sister for thinking the world revolves around her, your BIL for brushing off your engagement, your family for focusing only on the baby, and your fianc\u00e9 for not being unwilling to go to the NYE party.  I think it sounds like you are ALL suited to each other!", "YTA, did you get engaged to get accolades from your family, or because you love your girlfriend.", "YTA. Are you so needy and so much begging for attention as to not go to a party because they \u201cstole your thunder\u201d?\nGrow up. A pregnancy is far more important than an engagement.", "YTA but softly. Your sister and bil are also kind of assholes, but also softly on their part too.\n\nThe only thing your sister is the asshole about here is maybe her harsh words but even then I'd say lighty for her too.\n\nI'll be honest, your sister didn't upstage you in any way. I know in the comments you said that you understood this and it was a poor choice of words so i'll glosss over that, but you can't upstage something you don't know about. \n\nSo onto my real point. For one, congratulations! No matter my opinion on this post I'm happy regardless and I hope you and your fiances wedding is wonderful :) \n\nI think, and this is coming from someone both childless and fianceless, that the family rather understandably got caught up in what I can assume (?) is the hype of the first grandchild/niece/nephew/etc and while it sucks that your announcement got a bit blindsided it's kind of understandable (?) in the way that one of them is a tangible object that's coming in 8 months and the other is a wonderful and lovely concept that will be brought together in an undisclosed amount of time. \n\nI can only hope that when the edding planning properly starts and it comes closer to the big day the hype will be focused then, as that's where I'd personally look to see some real excitement and engagement at my own, well, engagement. \n\nThat's not to say you and your fiance aren't valid in feeling hurt, but I deinfitely think it's been blown out of propertion on both sides. I hope you get a chance to sit down with your sister, I think you'd regret it more having this become an issue and ruining both events for each other, over reconciling and enjoying your engagement and her pregnancy as a united family :)", "YTA. It sounds like your sister didn\u2019t mean to upstage you since the ultrasound gift was already wrapped before you announced the engagement. Did you expect her to just hide the gift and defer the news she had planned to announce? \n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9e will get plenty of attention as you go through the wedding planning process. There\u2019s lots of good news here, everyone should be happy for each other.", "NTA. And I\u2019ll get crucified for this. \n\nI\u2019m only saying this cause since they are HOSTING the New Year\u2019s party, they could have waited to give you guys your day. Like it wouldn\u2019t have hurt them to let you and your fianc\u00e9 to have your moment, since literally 7 days later they could have had their moment at their party.", "YTA - while you're not required to attend any party (it's an invitation, not a subpoena), refusing to attend because of this was petty.\n\nYou both planned surprises.  Everyone was happy for both of you.  It wasn't like you told your news and then everyone acted like it was NBD and refused to congratulate you or your sister purposely upstaged you.  There's enough happiness for everyone out there - it's not a finite resource.\n\nBut weddings and babies are...different.  No one is going to care as much about your wedding as you and it's not going to be a sustained excitement, even if there had not been a pregnancy announcement happening in the near vicinity.  People will be excited initially, but since they aren't the ones getting married, they just keep on living their lives and get excited as additional wedding events come up (shower, bach parties, the actual wedding day).  It may seem like the baby news cut things short for you (and maybe it did slightly), but you probably would have discovered very shortly that the initial excitement you received was going to be fairly short-lived regardless.  It doesn't mean they aren't happy for you nor does it mean they are \"less happy\" for you than they are your sister - but it's just the kind of news that doesn't impact their lives in the same way and you're not going to see exactly equal responses, even if their happiness is equal.", "NTA definitely wrong timing \nNo one's in the wrong here, if it were reversed and your engagement overshadowed her pregnancy she would've been upset as well.

This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed. This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nSo I\u2019m a guy and I recently proposed to my fianc\u00e9e about midway through December. We agreed to announce the engagement at the family Christmas party. My sister and her husband, who are both a couple years older than me, are also there. My sister and I have generally always gotten along, although her husband can tend to come off as a little rude at times, but he\u2019s never outright been a dick.\n\nSo we do a little gift exchange, and at the end of it, my fianc\u00e9e and I decide to make our announcement. So I say my piece, and everyone\u2019s excited about it. It was a nice moment that I was proud to have.\n\nThen my sister stands and holds up an unopened gift for our mother. Mom opens it, and it\u2019s a framed ultrasound image showing that my sister is pregnant, about a month along. It\u2019s a happy moment and I was happy to share in it. But after that, the pregnancy was all anyone talked about for the rest of the day, and the days after that. It was like they had completely forgotten about my fianc\u00e9e and I being engaged.\n\nI felt like my fianc\u00e9e had been cast aside. I didn\u2019t want to cause a scene at the party, because I was happy for my sister. Then every day of the following week, all anyone wanted to talk about was the baby.\n\nFinally, New Year\u2019s Eve came along. The party we have for that switches hosts every year, and it\u2019s my sister\u2019s house this time. My fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t want to go to that party because she felt uncomfortable. So I called them, and my brother in law answers. He asked me what was up, and I told him we weren\u2019t going to be able to make it. He tried to change my mind, saying \u201cyou and your girlfriend can come along\u201d. Like he had forgotten, or hadn\u2019t even acknowledged that we were engaged. I reminded him of our engagement, to which he said he couldn\u2019t have known since everyone was so excited about the baby. I hung up on him then, and tried to just move on from it.\n\nThen my sister called and asked me why I was upset about her baby. I told her I wasn\u2019t upset about it. I said it hurt when our family seemed to care more about her baby to the point that my fianc\u00e9e and I being engaged may as well have not happened because no one acknowledged it. She told me to grow up, and said it was selfish of me to avoid coming to a party becuase I was jealous of her happiness. I said that it wasn\u2019t that I was jealous, like I said I\u2019m happy for her that she\u2019s having a baby. But while she\u2019s taking a step in her life, I\u2019m also taking a step in my own life. I\u2019m engaged to a woman that I love and that I am prepared to spend the rest of my life with, and it feels like no one has acknowledged or respected that. Afterwards, she said I was being dramatic and that people would be more than happy to care about it when the wedding happened. Then she said I should quit whining and come to the party. I told her that I didn\u2019t want to go to a party hosted by someone who wouldn\u2019t be as happy for me as I am for her, and I hung up.\n\nSo what do you guys think?

But being upset about it? yeah, YTA.", "YTA- you didn\u2019t tell anyone that you were going to make a grand announcement at your family Christmas and neither did she.

My guess is no, so why not? Is it because people were more excited for her? If so, that isn't her fault, that's just what people were more excited about. \n\nShe didn't do anything intentional here, you both just had plans to announce things at an event that neither of you were in charge of, so both of you just have to deal with it.", "YTA.\n\nOne time, my parents and sister and her now-husband came out to eat with me to celebrate my birthday.  I was planning, while we were all together, to come out to them, and let them know I was dating a woman.\n\nThen, before I got a chance to come out, my sister announced her engagement.  So I didn't say anything for fear of overshadowing her announcement.  But then I suddenly had a ticking time bomb where I had to host another personal get together as soon as possible to get the whole family back in the same room again, because I have to come out to them before I come out to the rest of the family, and I have to come out to the rest of the family soon enough that there's another family event I can attend with my girlfriend before my sister's wedding, because then I'd be making a big scene and overshadowing her wedding.  It was hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not make a major announcement at a family gathering for another purpose if you aren't willing to share the spotlight.  You don't get to call dibs if you didn't throw the party.  You want it to be all about you while your sister shuts up about her pregnancy?  Throw a dinner party on a Tuesday and announce it then.  You've made the event just for this, it's all yours.  But Christmas is for everybody.  Everybody wants to take advantage of the fact that the whole family is together to tell them important things in person.  You don't get to call dibs on Christmas and neither does your sister.", "YTA.

Please realize that no one will be as excited about your engagement and wedding as you and your fianc\u00e9. Excited for you, happy for you\u2026? Yes. But as excited and happy as you two are? No, probably not. If your fianc\u00e9 is this upset that she feels uncomfortable being around your family now because she feels a baby announcement overshadowed the engagement announcement and took away the spotlight from you two,  I can only imagine how upset she will get if she feels something else overshadows or takes away the spotlight during wedding planning or the actual wedding.

If you opened the door for life changing announcements at a family holiday, then you can't be pissed when someone else does it too.

You guys need some communication improvements.", "You have to remember that the news of a grandchild is much bigger than the announcement of an engagement.", "YTA. Neither of you knew the other was making an announcement and neither of you owe the other a heads up. However, you can't hold it against her. She's not holding your engagement against you for overshadowing her announcement. \nIf it was unintentional then I think you should let it go.", "YTA.\n\n\nTo put it simply neither of you knew of the others' announcements, and neither of you can control how others act. You can only control how YOU act and you've decided to take your frustration of how others reacted out on your sister which IMO isn't warranted as she did nothing to you. \n\n\nInstead of taking your frustration out on her you need to talk to your other family members because frankly your sister is right, you need to grow up.", "YTA your family can celebrate both at the same time.

Keep up this behavior and expect that no one will want to celebrate your wedding as you are acting as a child.", "This is why people need to plan their own events, instead of attempting to hijack existing ones, if they want to be the center of attention when making big announcements.

Neither of us could have known about each other, and I had thought about that. As I say in the post, I am absolutely happy for her pregnancy, I guess it\u2019s just this feeling of my engagement being swept under the rug. But I would agree if you\u2019re suggesting that information could have been shared among us a little better.\n\nI also kinda feel like being more forthcoming with her about it would have helped, and in that regard, that\u2019s my fault for not doing it.", "Disagree - if I was the sis I would have waited maybe 30 minutes or something before sharing my thing.

Congrats on the engagement.", "It would bring a whole new meaning to \u201c it takes a village\u201d", "1) I\u2019ve been pregnant myself.\n2) she\u2019s not taking any risk a MC is going to happen weather you tell people or not.\n3) she clearly didn\u2019t do this just because OP shared news otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have the wrapped framed sonogram would she.\n4) if you get fertility treatment, if you pay privately, if you are high risk or if you have pain due to a cyst on the ovary you have Early scans. \nIf anyone doesn\u2019t know about pregnancy here it\u2019s you", "not quite true re-preg tests.  a blood HCG test will detect pregnancy literally hours after conception.  And a urine test can detect as soon as HCG spills over into the urine, which varies.  For most, you do not need a missed period, it's usually much less than a week after conception (they detect at 25 mcg, which is very, very little and a highly sensitive and accurate test.  Not everyone waits to tell people - most don't.", "The difference is OP made his announcement first.\n\nSo, if the expectation (and I'm not saying it is here, but it usually is) is one big announcement per event, then the sister should have held off once OP made his engagement announcement.", "I know, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m saying that I, or both of us, could have handled it better. Me especially.", "Thank you. Honestly, I thought I\u2019d just get angry all over again, but this experience has been very helpful in recognizing my own flaws. I\u2019ve taken it up with my fianc\u00e9e, we\u2019ve talked it out, and I think we\u2019re gonna be ok. Now I just need to talk to my sister about it.", "I think I would have just been more confused than angry lol. Like \u201cwow, sis, you pulled a pregnancy out of nowhere!\u201d I honestly would be impressed. I might have to mention this to her when the dust settles and we\u2019re passed this.", "Yes it would \ud83d\ude05", "If you know all this shit already, why are you insinuating that the sister should have told earlier? And I didn't do any of those things you listed off, so of course early scans weren't a thing.\n\nRegarding MC, why would you want to announce before 12 weeks?\n\nOther Person: \"How's the baby?\"\n\nPregnancy Announcer: \"Oh. I miscarried a few weeks ago.\"\n\nHaving that awkward, painful conversation an unknown number of times sounds like fucking hell. It happened to a coworker of mine and she was in a bad place for a while.", "So what should the sister have done?\n\"Yeah, Mom, I have another present for your, but I cannot give it to you because OP got engaged\"", "One when did OP ever say that was the rule of there family.\n2) the sister had the gift ready for her mother so she had it planned too why was OPs news more important than hers.", "It's Christmas. The expectation is to eat, drink, open presents and be merry. OP wasn't owed anything since it's an event for the entire family. If every single member of the family had brought a gift to announce some random milestone in their life, then they should have the same freedom as OP.", "No you\u2019re not, I\u2019m sorry but your behaving like your sister did something wrong when she literally did the same thing as you.", "Why some one else would isnt the issue.  But people do it all the time. The sister was telling family, not the world. These are the people who you\u2019d want to support you if you do miscarry, which is why I told my family early. But honestly, many people don\u2019t really expect miscarriages with first pregnancies and get too excited to contain it.  It doesn\u2019t matter why people do it. People do do it though and Op\u2019s sister had just as much right to share her news as Op did.", "I have had 2 miscarriages and told people the first time before 12 weeks and i told people the second time before 12 weeks. Did it hurt to have to tell them the awful news. Yes. But equally so I also had a wonderful support network. People can tell people they're pregnant whenever they want to. Weird that you think otherwise.", "When did I once say that??", "Honestly, I completely missed the fact that it was already a wrapped gift in their presence.\n\nI dunno. If the sister could have removed it stealthily, that might have been a good idea.\n\nAt the very least, though, they (the sister/family) could have actually cared about OPs news, even after the pregnancy announcement.", "He didn't. And I'm not saying he did.\n\nBut generally speaking, when one person makes a big life changing announcement like that, the polite thing to do, IMO, is hold off on your own and let them have their moment.\n\nIt's not that OPs or the sisters announcement was more important than the other, it's just that big announcements like that are deserving of their own moment.", "I\u2019m talking in hindsight here. I acknowledge that I overreacted, and I\u2019m glad I posted this because it\u2019s given me clarity on the situation. I feel a lot better about it, and I realize that my anger was misplaced.", "My sister has been very excited about this, and honestly despite everything, I\u2019m still happy for her. I\u2019m hoping to clear the air becuase I do want to support her and show her how happy I am. It\u2019s a baby after all.", "I agree, they should have paid attention to both.", "Are you saying that OP\u2019s sister should\u2019ve held off on giving their mom her gift? She had an ultrasound picture wrapped in a frame. What do you think would\u2019ve been the right way for the sister to handle it?", "Yeah well if that was the case they were already there to celebrate Christmas together so if OP wanted the attention to be only on him then maybe he should of hosted his own event", "That\u2019s a good show of self-awareness, considering where you started from. On the other hand, it\u2019s a little concerning that you\u2019re angry at all. \n\nWhere would the \u201cappropriate\u201d place for your anger be, in your opinion? Because frankly your sister is right. You\u2019re being dramatic and immature because your surprise announcement didn\u2019t play out the exact way you envisioned. People will honor you plenty at your wedding, but in the meantime, if you and your fianc\u00e9e get this keyed up about people not kissing the ring, you\u2019ll make everyone needlessly miserable, including each other.", "Honestly, I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t hold off. It wouldn\u2019t be right of me to tell her to not give our mother a gift like that.", "I agree with that. But I don't think he's the asshole for being upset that his big news was overshadowed like that.\n\nEspecially given this later conversation with BIL, which proved that OP was right and that his news was overshadowed -\n\n> He tried to change my mind, saying \u201cyou and your girlfriend can come along\u201d. Like he had forgotten, or hadn\u2019t even acknowledged that we were engaged. I reminded him of our engagement, to which he said he couldn\u2019t have known since everyone was so excited about the baby."]}
