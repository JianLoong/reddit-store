{"id": 30661, "submission_id": "17rpoot", "title": "AITA for showing up to the wedding even after bride said she didn't want me there?", "selftext": "This involves me, JJ (Bride) and Calvin (groom).\n\nCalvin and I grew up together as sandbox kids/neighbors. Took baths together, spent every waking moment of the first 14 years of our life together from preschool to trips our parents would take us on. Our parents always said we were destined to get married and even as kids, Calvin would always say I'd be the one he'd get married to. High school, we grew apart. There was no bad blood, we just had different interests and I was an unattractive nerd while he was star of the football team as clich\u00e9 as it sounds. We'd still see each other on occasion through holiday parties and neighborhood dinners.\n\nNow we're 30. I feel much better about myself and have found success in my single life. Calvin then announced he was engaged a year ago to JJ. There was a holiday party with our families again and my parents went (I was out of town). Apparently both families and Calvin mentioned me when sharing his baby photos and that they always thought it would be us engaged. It didn't seem to be in a bad way, just kind of a joke. According to my mom, afterwards, JJ seemed to be really intimidated by me and the past.\n\nApparently the families are still hanging onto the idea that I still wanted to marry Calvin. Sure, I was a tiny bit disappointed but it was like letting go of a childhood crush on Peter Pan, I'm not heartbroken about it and don't feel like anything was taken from me.\n\nMove on to JJ. She found me on facebook and contacted me saying that she would appreciate if I didn't go to the wedding because she saw me as an 'ex' despite us never having a relationship. I left it on read and went anyway to support my friend and he was thankful I was there. Wished them well at the dinner table and went back to minding my own business and chatting with the other neighbors, Calvin's family, etc.\n\nJJ reached out to me again and told me she was really disappointed in me and that me being there ruined her image of having a perfect wedding. I haven't shared this with anyone and don't think I will. I don't feel close enough to Calvin anymore to put a damper on his relationship. She seemed nice enough from what everyone's said, so that had me thinking if I really did ruin her wedding by being an AH and showing up anyway.\n\nETA: Yes, I was invited! Sorry, missed that bit of information.\n\nETA 2: Calvin's parents and my parents are best friends for life/neighbors. We will always have that connection to Calvin and JJ. My parents treat JJ like a daughter in law as well since Calvin has pretty much been like a brother, despite not being close anymore. It's a complicated situation\n\nETA 3: I'm going to stop replying to comments, thanks for the input everyone. I've read through each one and I'm still a bit torn. Unfortunately, I can't do anything about the situation now. Would I have changed things? I don't know what evil would have been best to choose. None of the options seemed like a winner in my book and drama is something to leave in high school days. Drama is exhausting to keep up with especially when you're just turning 30. Did I have a crush on him? Yes, a little kid crush. Did I want to marry him? No. Did it bother me he was marrying someone else? No. I mourned our childhood for a moment but that was it. We're two very different, adult people at this point in time. No point in obsessing over it. But to clear some things up, for those who are also confused, I'm FTM trans. I don't appear male due to lack of hormones and also an unaccepting family so I will always be a woman to them and 'wife material' to whomever. I've received a few messages, positive and negative, and in my own fashion, I don't think it's a good idea to respond to hostility. If it upsets you like it upset JJ, oh well. There's nothing I can do about JJ's situation now. Have at it reddit and have fun with the comments and debates! It's been a doozy to read.

But I hope you've been talking to whoever has \"apparently\" been talking about how you wanted to marry Calvin and shutting that shit down", "NTA. She fucked this up for herself very badly by not communicating her feelings to her spouse, like an adult does. Attempting to unilaterally uninvite her spouse's close friend without telling him is her childish mistake to own. \n\nIgnoring it is probably what I would have done \u2014 sounds like you're close enough to him that you wanted to be there, but not so close that you'd wade into drama between him and his wife. Sadly, I'd probably continue to keep my distance. If she or anyone ever really presses you for a response, I think it's totally fair to say that you were really uncomfortable about her doing this behind Calvin's back, didn't know how to engage with it without creating drama right before the wedding, and figured you'd respect the wishes of your actual friend while keeping a respectful distance, which is what you did.", "We\u2019re you invited? If yes, NTA. Their marriage is doomed if she\u2019s writing to you instead of being honest with him, or if she was honest and he ignored it, either way!", "INFO: You don't actually say it so I have to ask: you did receive an invitation to the wedding, yes?", "I feel like the people who suck the most here are the parents who decided their young children should get married. Speaking from personal experience, it\u2019s a toxic way to grow up. You were children playing in the sandbox, not looking for a spouse.", "Info:  Have you ever met JJ before?", "NTA since you were invited.\n\nI would have told Calvin, though. JJ is very insecure, and I wonder if that will continue to show up during their marriage.", "JJ went behind Calvin's back and asked you to not go to the wedding?\n\nO_O Bruh.\n\nThat's some really big insecurity.  Here's the thing, my husband invited an ex girlfriend to our wedding...he told me about it and his reason for wanting her there was that her seeing us get married would make it crystal clear to her that she had no future with him. I had zero problem with her being there, she was a really sweet, pretty girl but I wasn't threatened by her in any way. We all had a great time and that was that.\n\nYou are NTA. You are a lifelong friend of the groom. He would have wondered why your weren't there if you don't show up. \n\nETA: And honestly, with her insecurity issues popping up this hard right at the beginning, I wouldn't be surprised if there are other massive issues in their relationship that are about to be revealed now that they're married.", "i find it unsettling and very red flaggy that she would privately message you rather than talk to her husband about it.  i wish him the best, she sounds sly, insecure, and controlling.  you don't need to share it with anyone, IMO.  it'll open a can of worms that doesn't necessarily need to be opened.  definitely NTA.", "I think you should have checked with Calvin and that it's a bit weird to go to a wedding when you know that the bride or groom doesn't want you there.\n\nOverall though, the problem is with them for sending you mixed messages. That doesn't bode them for their marriage if she couldn't bring it up and decided to sneakily tell you not to come or if she did and they couldn't figure it out between themselves. It's a red flag for controlling behavior on her part, which was a reason to let him know. \n\nIt's a bit shitty and immature of the parents to still be hung up about their kids not getting together and to let it known, when he's marrying someone else.\n\nNTA, I hesitated with E S H but while I'm not sure you took the best course of actions, it sounds like you were well- intended and meant to avoid drama.", "ESH\n\nyou should have brought it up to Calvin to get it all straightened out.  If you don't feel close enough to Calvin to share this, you shouldn't feel close enough to take it for granted you are going to the wedding.  But I'm not sure why you say you don't feel close enough to Calvin to have mentioned this, but you are apparently close enough to still be in the loop with the parents.  And whether she is right or wrong, she's a co-host of the event and if she disinvites you, I mean it's her event along with Calvin's  \n\nbut yea, it's just as immature to intentionally ignore this and cause more drama instead of addressing the issue. Going on to claim that you aren't close enough to discuss this seems insincere. You spent the whole rest of the post describing how close you were and presumably just had to go because you were that close.", "I can't call you an AH because you officially had an invite. But if a spouse reached out to me asking me not to go, I'm not going out of respect for that person on their wedding day. \n\nI was going to go ESH , but I don't know if JJ talked to the husband about it or not.", "NTA\n\n> me being there ruined her image of having a perfect wedding.\n\nHow fragile that image must be!", "NTA and a big yikes for their marriage if she\u2019s that insecure\u2026although maybe she\u2019s insecure because his family CLEARLY aren\u2019t fans of hers\u2026double yikes.\n\nThe thing with the albums and the comments is just so so weird. \n\nIn any case- not your circus, not your monkeys.\n\nI would be tempted to mention it to a mutual friend though- someone you trust not to be dramatic and who can keep it under their hat for now, but if JJ starts making a pattern of bullying people she\u2019s insecure around, someone will be able to give the poor husband a heads up that it\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s been weird and crazy. I\u2019d just always want the best for a childhood friend even if we\u2019ve grown apart.", "ESH\n\nIt's pretty uncool that she let her insecurity get the better of her like that, but why would you decide your feelings are more important that the BRIDE'S?", "ESH. If you don\u2019t feel close enough to Calvin to even bring this up, why did you feel the need to go? Especially knowing the bride didn\u2019t want you there?!", "Absolutely not the asshole. Calvin wanted you there and it\u2019s his wedding too. It\u2019s not all about the bride. She was being petty and sounds like she doesn\u2019t even really know you.\n\nI am a bit on the fence about whether you should tell him. If you\u2019re telling the truth and have no lingering feelings that is. If you have feelings then don\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m on the fence because this is a bit of a red flag for her to ask you not to come but on the other hand anxiety and insecurity can be super hard on someone. So usually I\u2019d err on the side of caution and not tell him.\n\nStill think NTA", "NTA. The \"joke\" about you marrying your friend in front of his bride was really inappropriate, but you played no part in that. Plus, it was very gracious of you for not sharing what she said. All you did was support a friend in his wedding, nothing more.", "YTA.  Why would you go go a wedding where the bride specifically doesn't want you?  Yes it's Calvin's day but it's her day too and even if her reasoning seems weird to you she didn't want you there.\n\nAren't you enjoying single life.  Go do that.", "YTA, by leaving her on read and not taking a chance to clarify how platonic your relationship with her husband was you let her believe the family\u2019s embellished tales. I also can\u2019t imagine showing up to a wedding I was explicitly not wanted at, regardless of family relationship to one side, that\u2019s just bizarre to me. \u2014If Calvin or family were to ask why you didn\u2019t go you could just be honest and say you respected JJ\u2019s wishes and didn\u2019t attend, then you wouldn\u2019t have looked bad and the ball would be in her court.", "YTA. If the bride says you're not welcome there that pretty much trumps the original invite. I'm also confused why you still wanted to go given you say how you no longer are that close with the family.  Part of the time you're saying he's like a brother but then you say you won't ever tell him about this since you no longer feel close to him. Lots of conflicting signals.", "NTA. You handled it as well as you could, and it would have made way more drama if you didn't go.\n\nYou might firmly point out to both parents that it's not nice to keep perpetuating the \"we thought they'd get married\" thing, especially to Calvin's wife. That has to stop. It's kind of mean and I'm sure contributed to her insecurity about having you at the wedding.", "NTA. I think you ignored her message with class and turned up to support your childhood friend. Any possible drama has gone the way of the fairies, whereas Any other actions would have resulted in more drama than it's worth. Class act", "His family sucks and clearly made her feel bad, but she's the one who didnt talk to her soon to be husband on the issue and instead went behind his back to try make you not come. Nta", "NTA", "They shouldn\u2019t be getting married if she is insecure about having another \u2018potential suitor\u2019 there (for lack of better word.) He chose her: You get that; she should get that. You are NTA. It\u2019s weird she didn\u2019t speak to her husband about this \u2018issue\u2019. I predict  they won\u2019t be married in 10 years because a couple who are insecure and don\u2019t communicate don\u2019t usually do well. But fingers crossed they are the exception!", "You were invited. You attended. Nobody did anything embarrassing or hostile. The bride stupidly couldn't let a total non-event lie, and exposed her jealousy in a nonpublic, but stupid, way. You haven't told anyone about it, and you won't.\n\nThat adds up to a pretty clear NTA.", "Nta. It seems to me you made the least drama-free choice! If she wanted to, she could\u2019ve discussed it with her then fianc\u00e9, but instead she brought it to you via messenger, not even a face to face discussion. I kinda get it though, she didn\u2019t want to make assumptions & possibly lead to a huge fight & possibly the end of the relationship. But she could\u2019ve had the maturity to talk about to you in person. And let\u2019s say you were to show that message to Calvin, he would\u2019ve confronted her and then everyone knows & bam, drama. Or let\u2019s say you decide not to go, then everyone is left wondering and the truth comes out. I mean I think the truth is going to come out regardless, but at least it didn\u2019t sour the wedding day. So yea, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. You were in delicate situation & I think I would\u2019ve done the exact same thing.", "NTA. you won\u2019t even mention her behavior to anyone and tbh i think that proves you\u2019re not trying to be petty in any way. you were invited, and the groom is the one who is your friend. \n\ni think maybe if he had also asked you not to go i\u2019d feel differently, but she clearly did this behind his back", "NTA. Fck JJ. End of story.\nPS: Wish you all the best in your life!", "NTA. I see JJ as the problematic one here. Oh dear, she's really disappointed in you, how will you live with yourself? If her wedding has been ruined, that's drama of her own making.", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s projecting her insecurities. You were invited by him and his family, and they wanted you there.\n\nThis is a \u201cher\u201d problem that she\u2019s making a \u201cyou\u201d problem", "I\u2019d say NTA because JJ is hella insecure and if she doesn\u2019t even want to tell Calvin she doesn\u2019t want you there then why should you pretend and make up excuses for your absence on her behalf? She was just hoping you would go away and not have to actually acknowledge that she is so insecure. The day wasn\u2019t only about her, it was about Calvin too and he wanted you there. JJ\u2019s issue is between her and Calvin. \n\nAlso, I would just ignore the messages from JJ and not even acknowledge it. You will see them in the future if your families are as close as you say\u2026she will just have to figure out that you\u2019re not a threat and will likely move on to the next girl she feels threatened by.", "NTA. If bride did not want you there, she should have ensured that you were not invited to the wedding and/or asked Calvin to disinvite you.", "Idk if you\u2019re ta, but I\u2019m also not sure why you would go to a wedding where either the bride or groom didn\u2019t want you there\u2026.. it\u2019s not super kind. I", "NTA, since you were invited to the wedding. JJ sounds like an insecure person.", "NTA - JJ is ridiculous. You didn't even date, and are not in close contact. You've done nothing wrong. It would have been weird if you didn't go, and would have made it seem like you were hung up on him. She sounds incredibly insecure.", "Unpopular YTA from me.  You haven\u2019t talked to him in a long time, remember the fun from the past, leave it in the past.  He is loving on with his wife, she would feel more comfortable if you weren\u2019t there, and you went because that\u2019s what you wanted.  The wedding is about them starting their new lives together, and you haven\u2019t been a part of that since you hadn\u2019t even met her.", "NTA. If she keeps this crap up, I'd be showing it to Calvin. He was the one that invited you. Her 'perfect' wedding was just her not wanting any sort of reminder of someone else that was important to the groom before her\n\nEdit: Swapped JJ for Calvin.  My bad", "NTA! You were an invited guest,  your families have been friends for years, not to mention you and the groom were once very close friends. The bride had no business going behind the groom's back and asking you not to attend. You went, offered your congratulations, and had fun with out intruding on the celebration. Very classy on your part!\n\nGo and live your best life and never give them (especially the disappointed bride!) another thought!!", "If you received an invitation: NTA\n\nIf you didn't receive an invitation and weren't invited: YTA", "NTA. You were invited!!", "NTA. You were invited, and you attended. You aren't an ex, so the bride was out of line in persisting in viewing you as one and uninviting you (probably without telling Calvin). The real villains in the story are the relatives who said all that BS about you and Calvin getting married in front of JJ. That was a lousy thing to do and set you on the wrong path with JJ.", "NTA\n\nYou were invited. It\u2019s not just JJs wedding, but Calvin\u2019s as well. He wanted you there, so you went.

That makes a huge difference. NTA, and I wonder how Calvin would feel knowing his wife told his childhood best friend not to come to the wedding because she considered you to be an \"ex.\"", "NTA.  I think you should at least show your parents, so they know what you\u2019re dealing with they welcome her into their home and functions they host.", "NTA because instead of talking to her fianc\u00e9 about her very real concerns, she came at you secretly. You had a right to go, so you did.\n\nHis and your family are AHs though for \"joking\" in front of JJ that they always thought you and Calvin would wind up together.

They would use it as further proof that you are still in love with him since you had no other good reason for not attending a family event that you and your parents were invited to.

Yeah, that would be a shitty way for him to communicate, but there\u2019s a lot of couples that have this dynamic.\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d say you\u2019re an AH, but I can\u2019t imagine going to a wedding when one person in the couple has asked me not to, and the other person in the couple is someone I haven\u2019t really been friends with in years. I would immediately assume that he just probably was too nice to tell me about what his fianc\u00e9e wanted, so that he let her be the \u201cbad guy\u201d even though she had his support in doing so.\n\nI\u2019m more leaning ESH because I feel like he made his now-wife the \u201cbad guy\u201d, but you also bought into him creating that dynamic.", "NTA, tell JJ you'll marry Calvin when he's single again", "It's both our families. Calvin's parents and my parents. My parents are those kind that brush it off if you try to shut things down but now that the wedding has happened, I imagine it won't be happening much anymore.", "More importantly, OP needs to show Calvin how petty his new bride is.", "That's pretty much it. I didn't want any drama to happen before wedding time, during, or after and didn't want to be that rude neighbor either that just doesn't show up for the wedding when the rest of my family is going to be there, too. \n\nBut now I'm dreading the upcoming holiday parties.", "Oh, yes! I think the invites were before the holiday party but tbh I don't fully remember the timestamp the invites were sent out but did receive one!", "Was looking for this comment. I\u2019d say op will have another shot in a few years after the divorce.", "Whoops! Yes, I did receive an invite! Though I do believe the invites went out before the holiday party.", "Not outside of the wedding and facebook!", "This! Agree, it\u2019s not just JJ\u2019s wedding! Making that decision on her own without consulting Calvin points to possible future communication issues. \n\nHad you mentioned to your family that she uninvited you, yes that would have caused more drama that just showing up. NTA", "It's... hard to explain. We'd really only see each other and talk at those parties after high school which was once or twice a year. We've both changed as people and this kind of drama seems like it's straight out of high school years. Our parents are still best friends with one another to this day and still neighbors, so there is still a strong connection to the family regardless of our friendship. It's more like cousins/uncles/aunts than anything at this point. \n\nWe're also southern, so I've got it hammered into me to be kind to thy neighbor and whatnot and have been there to celebrate each others accomplishments in life like graduation, etc, so it would feel a little wrong to not go to the wedding either because there's so much history, if that makes sense.", "seriously.  there is too much contradiction about not feeling close to him, but describing in great detail how they are close. if you can't talk to him about this, then clerly you aren't that close and if you aren't that close, you shouldn't assume you are such close friends that it's worth overriding the bride's attempt to disinvite you.", "Op probably felt like she should go due to family dynamics. Afterall, sounded like OPand her entire family were invited. If OP skipped the wedding, the two families wpuld likely ask why she didnt go. Why should OP need to lie and absorb that drama?  If bride wants to officially uninvite one of her husband's guests, groom needs to on board.", "Yeah. This is my takeaway. That leapt out at me.", "It's like a cousin. You're family. I consider Calvin family like a cousin, regardless if we still talk much or not. Even if you don't see or talk to your cousin for years outside of business casual conversations and over a few holiday drinks, you'd still want to show up to support them on an important day.", "That's where I'm torn, too. I don't know whether it is insecurity or anxiety that caused her to reach out, and Calvin and I don't even message one another anymore. Haven't even after cellphones were invented. We'd just show up at each others house until highschool. It would feel a little odd to talk to him about it.", "She did if she and Calvin aren\u2019t saying anything to there parents to stop it", "If it\u2019s equally their day, why does the bride get to determine who comes and who doesn\u2019t if they were invited by the groom? The correct answer is the bride should have spoken to the groom but she didn\u2019t because she knew it was wrong.", "Plus it's creepy that the first thing she mentioned is that she took baths with the groom", "I agree and OP is, as you put it, a true class act.\n\nNTA", "JJ is the girl. She'd be showing it to Calvin", "Agreed, NTA. JJ was the one Calvin married, so she needs to take the win and grow the f\\*\\*\\* up!", "For everyone's sake I hope not", "They were engaged at the holiday party when your families were showing pictures of the two of talking about it. Why would the fact that they\u2019re legally married change anything for people who \u201cbrush it off\u201d when they\u2019re told they\u2019ve done something fucked up?\n\nAlso, do your parents actually think of JJ as a daughter in law? Because it is especially weird for them to do that if that\u2019s true. But it seems far more likely that they don\u2019t actually feel that way", "she\u2019s not petty she\u2019s insecure, and rightfully so. imagine being engaged to someone and pretty much everyone around y\u2019all are fantasizing about them being with someone else. idk why everyone acts like it\u2019s wrong to be insecure, it\u2019s a normal feeling most people experience. she\u2019s only wrong for uninviting op without her fianc\u00e9\u2019s knowing.", "Good luck! If you're in a stressful situation, I do think you're entitled to confide discreetly in your support system, potentially including family. But that ofc depends on having family who are gracious and tactful instead of drama-mongers, which can be... rare.", "Slight YTA from me. I know I'm the minority but someone you never met messages you requesting you don't go to her wedding and you ignored her and showed up anyway. I would feel differently if you and the groom were still close but sounds like you haven't been close on over a decade. \n\nIn her mind all she knows about you is how everyone in his family wishes it was you up there and not her. When she asked you not to come you could have tried to make her feel more comfortable about you coming but instead you said screw it I'm just going anyway.", "Well it feels to me it would be unkind to blatantly ignore you neighbor when they tell you I'd prefer you don't come to my wedding. Even if you were determined to go, I think the kind thing would be to reiterate you will be going so she's not taken by surprise on her wedding day.  There is no excuse for leaving her on read. you could have explained to her what you just explained to me. Better yet, you could have told all this to your friend so they can talk and hash out the issue.", "She doesn\u2019t need to lie. She could have reached out to the groom and said something. The \u201cnot wanting to cause drama\u201d piece is irrelevant. Parents already caused drama by telling JJ they thought her fianc\u00e9 was going to marry someone else.", "But you knew your family and his are always saying they wished you guys got married you could also say to them to stop doing it because it\u2019s gonna hurt and probably the DIL isn\u2019t coming over to visit if there doing this all the time and the same with Calvin both of you guys should have said anything to both your families", "Not if there spouse asked me not to. But I guess that\u2019s just me.", "That\u2019s totally fair. If you see shady stuff maybe tell him if you\u2019re in the position to do so, otherwise their life, their marriage.", "\"I'm interested in... dating... engaged to JJ,\" should have been MORE than sufficient for people to get that it needed to stop.

If my friends fiance called me as asked me not to attend I'd talk to my friend but I wouldn't show up.", "Edited! Thanks for letting me know", "I hope not either. It got old LOL", "Over a stranger who has barely seen her soon-to-be husband in years, never dated him, and has no current involvement with his life?\n\nReaching out behind his back to uninvited her?\n\nWhining about how this one person's presence, who is not a threat to the relationship, completely ruined her fairy tale?\n\nNo, this is petty.", "We're southern LOL Nagging and bragging about family members is in the blood.", "I didn't know a proper way to respond to be honest. It rubbed me the wrong way, yeah, but I didn't want to respond in a negative fashion and I may be an AH in the regard that I find it almost impossible to fake a kind response if it's not genuine so I ignored it. I didn't go to spite her. I was also afraid that if I didn't go, I'd be guilted to death by my family and his parents since I had no valid excuse and I'd also feel bad if he wondered why I chose not to come so I went just to appear and sign the book and congratulate them and minded my business.", "If the bride didn\u2019t tell the groom that she uninvited his friend, then it just makes the friend look shitty for not showing up. To everyone except the bride. \n\nI guess she could take the hit and just be known as an asshole for the rest of her life. Or she could tell the groom and start a bunch of drama.\n\nThe bride really put her in a bad situation by doing it behind the groom\u2019s back.", "Either option just feels like a straight ticket to drama town.", "I'm glad for the y-t-comments because the more I think about it, I can't imagine going to a wedding the bride asked me not to attend. Or at least, not knowing this woman, talking to her or my friend, the groom, about it. I feel bad for the bride tbh", " If she reached out to the groom before the wedding, it would have made the situation 10x worse. The Bride would be even more upset after confronted by the groom.Then third parties without context may even think OP is trying to start something.\n\nOp's parents starting drama with their comments doesn't mean that OP is starting drama. I agree that OP can and should have a talk with her parents to stop those unnecessary comments but that is an entire different issue to the wedding invite.", "Yess thankyou", "I feel I have to disagree with you. I\u2019m being uninvited by someone I don\u2019t know because she feels that my friend and I basically dated because of how close we were and how close our families are. I need a better reason to not show up for a special occasion for my close family friends other than the bride is insecure with a past friendship where nothing seemingly happened.", "The stranger has parents that are close enough to the couple that, according to OP, they view JJ as a daughter in law. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually that crazy to think \u201cI don\u2019t feel awesome about this\u201d. I don\u2019t think she did the right thing but  the idea that she\u2019s completely out of order for feeling the way she does is unkind to me.", "I don\u2019t know how others don\u2019t see this. She put you in a really bad spot by doing it behind the groom\u2019s back. Then it falls on you to either look like an asshole for not going or having to create drama by telling your friend you were uninvited.", "There is a lot of things you could say that are in between being negative and not saying anything. Because it's not \"impossible\" to say you never dated her fiancee and barely seen him since you became adults. That's very easy to do but you chose the route that was easier for you. \n\nSidenote. Would have given you more credit if you said you wanted to be there for your friend. Instead it sounds like you just worried about what everyone would think about you.", "And maybe he was guilted into inviting you. \n\nYTA. The bride reached out to tell you she didn\u2019t want you to come and you still went. You were uninvited at that point. What YOUR parents want or his parents want do not matter. The only ones who matter are the bride and groom. Your entitlement to how you think you fit into his life is gross. People change and you even said you two aren\u2019t close.\n\nI think you did do it out of spite, especially since you admitted in a comment hoping yall would still get married. Asshole.", "You actually had a valid excuse. If anyone asked, just tell them or show them her message. If Calvin is your family then you should have been able to ask him about her first message. How do you know he didn't agree with JJ about uninviting you?", "> If the bride didn\u2019t tell the groom that she uninvited her friend, then it just makes the friend look shitty for not showing up. To everyone except the bride.\n\nAbsolutely! That's why I suggested \"you could have explained to her what you just explained to me. Better yet, you could have told all this to your friend so they can talk and hash out the issue.\" talking it out avoids the issue you brought up. I don't know why you are being so dramatic and suggesting OP never speak about it to anyone for the rest of her life. OP started drama already by going without saying anything. Better to resolve the drama before the wedding rather than let it play out at the wedding, don't you agree?", "Yea, that train is taking off either way.  but it's better they deal with it before the wedding instead of being surprised at the wedding.  Once they get married that's hard to undo.  You let them get to the point of no return without saying anything.", "As a fellow southerner, I would advise you to loop your parents in on these messages. Drama is probably still stirring, and you don\u2019t want them to find themselves in a difficult situation unawares. Plus, southern mamas have a way of sorting things, for good or for ill. \ud83d\ude02", "Because she's insecure about a childhood neighbor?", "We do.  Because I'm not petty enough to ruin someone's day because of my preferences.  It's not that big a deal to me because it's not my big day.", "Lol, true true true, but the whole point of this sub is to ID the asshole! So if you're going to provide consideration for the POV of the injuring party, be savvy! Lol\n\nYes, it's obviously fair for the girl to be unsettled and trying to act to address what is unsettling. As a woman, I can understand why her first instinct is not to confront 2 sets of parents making those crap comments--even the OP does not manage to find a way to shut that shit down, I get it. We all know why OK Boomer became a saying! Lolol. But seriously, secretly uninviting someone is....bullying plain and simple. The guest list is decided by the couple, not by one making a unilateral decision and then the other making a secret opposite unilateral decision.", "How do we know it was behind the groom\u2019s back?", "Christ, Reddit is brutal LOL \n\nObviously yes I wanted to be there for my friend. He's like a cousin/brother. I'll never forget growing up together or how the he locked me in the bathroom because I beat him at Hi-Ho Cherry-O when we were 4 or how we always tried to murk each other on the inner tubes behind the boat. Of course I wanted to be there for him. \n\nThe other truth of the matter is, is that our families NAG and will always nag about everything and anything and if I didn't go, I'd hear it the rest of my life as well!", "Path of least resistance is actually fine sometimes.", "If the groom also didn\u2019t want her there then the bride wouldn\u2019t have had to sneak her a FB message. She was avoiding having the discussion with him and wanted to avoid looking like the awful, jealous fianc\u00e9.", "She would not have had to sneak the request through a FB message if he agreed.", "She didn\u2019t start any drama by going. She left it up to the couple to discuss any insecurities without involving her in it.", "Hell, if it's going down that path...  it will happen anyway in another form. Maybe I'm wrong and she really is a nice girl. Calvin's parents and my parents are best friends for life. My parents hold JJ in high regards and are like a 2nd pair of inlaws and speak highly of her, so it could have been a fluke. I don't know.", "But it\u2019s my close family friend\u2019s day. If my presence, someone who is the daughter of the people who treat her like a daughter in law, is enough to ruin her wedding day, then I feel she may need to seek counseling to work through the insecurities she has because she has a long marriage ahead of her where she\u2019s not communicating her insecurities to her partner.", "*I didn't go, I'd hear it the rest of my life as well!*\n\nHonestly, you were damned if you went, and damned if you hadn't. Actually, my guess is that if you hadn't gone, lots of people were going to notice and it would make the situation hella awkward. It's ironic but it's probably better you went because it could have led to JJ's insecurity rearing its ugly head. Then EVERYONE would know.", "So you be ok going to someone's wedding who doesn't want you there because your family would complain.  That seems to be the main reason you went. Plus you had the opportunity to get to know her and make you presence there welcomed.

Or you could have just gone to the ceremony and skipped the reception, or maybe just avoid a direct contact from the bride, who asked you not to come. \n\nI get that you wanted to avoid drama but trying to pretend you had two options ignores so many alternatives.", "You need to ignore this chain of comments honestly.  \"Oh it's HER wedding\" \"the BRIDE'S wedding\".  So not only do they don't think the groom that you've known basically your entire life isn't important enough to have input, they even insinuate that he was guilted into inviting you.  They don't even grant the groom enough humanity that he would be allowed an informed opinion.", "How do we know they didn\u2019t have the conversation? Maybe Calvin didn\u2019t want to tell her. \n\nWe don\u2019t know bc OP doesn\u2019t know. Bc instead of reaching out to Calvin to ask and clarify, she just did what she wanted. Nice story though. Good try.", "It wouldn't have hurt to double check. OP says she never met JJ before the wedding in person, sometimes FB is the easiest form of contact. The reasoning she keeps saying is that their families would've nagged her endlessly. There are better reasons to use.", "This post clearly describes Facebook drama between her and the bride. I don't know what you think drama is.", "So if you believe conflict will happen inevitably, why would. You not warn your supposedly good friend before he gets married?

I'm not in the wedding party.  \n\nBut some people are unable to put the needs of anyone above themselves if they are technically allowed to do something. \n\nAnyways I hope OPs friend and his wife have a great life.

Any family who knew the groom in his childhood would surely at least have heard of OP and how close they are.

If they actually discussed it, HE would have let her down easy and explained that her presence would make the bride uncomfortable. And then she could also tell the family that\u2019s why she\u2019s not going.

If you acknowledge that it\u2019s equally both their days, one person shouldn\u2019t have sole veto power over those that are invited by the other party. In a healthy relationship, it\u2019s discussed and a reason as to why that person is no longer wanted at the wedding is explained. In an unhealthy relationship, nothing is discussed and someone just goes around making decisions for both of them without considering the feelings of their partner.

Or if you leave it, you may find that there is plenty of opportunity to tell her this if she is very salty towards you and there are comments at the next thing you both attend.\n\nShe hasn't told Calvin her fears by the sounds of it and she needs to.  Calvin should do a lot to shut down the inappropriate comments from his and your family because they do need to take her insecurity into account.

Surely if he knew and supported it, he would have been part of officially uninviting OP, or both let OP know that they didn\u2019t want them there if there would have been family friend drama with the parents if there was an official un-invitation.", "Because it\u2019s not her place to get between their marriage. FFS is that really something you would want to deal with?", "Ok let\u2019s say it went the way you propose.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t the bride just say in her message \u201cwe discussed it and both think it\u2019s best you don\u2019t come.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t have to slyly beg her not to. The story you\u2019re coming up with just doesn\u2019t fit with the information we know.", "Yes.", "Yes. Because OP didn't cause a scene at the wedding, she said hello and kept away. There are possibly only two people who know about the message unless either party shared it. They could continue on as though nothing ever happened unless the bride complains about it and shows herself. Talking about it before hand would have caused endless drama, this scenario is actually the least drama filled if the bride can contain herself.", "And how was the bride being emotionally mature here? She went behind her fianc\u00e9\u2019s back.", "Ridiculous\u2026 the bride should have been upfront with the groom\u2026 speaks volumes for the trust in their relationship\u2026 you seem petty to think that OP should have just not gone because of the lack of trust between the couple. This world is soft. They\u2019re getting married and the bride is worried about someone he never dated\u2026 recipe for success.", "By OP\u2019s own admission, she was hurt when she realized her Peter Pan proposed to someone else. Despite OP and the guy never having dated themselves. She was too invested in the parents talking about them being together and thought they would manifest it with no chemistry there. Bc let\u2019s be real, he would have made a move at multiple points if he were ever seriously interested in OP. She was nothing but a friend to him their whole lives. Sucks for the bride that she got something else painted in her mind bc of the family\u2019s reckless comments. Talking like that around someone\u2019s SO is just tacky without reaffirming that their relationship is real to them.", "For a brief moment, yes? It was literally over in 5 minutes. Less jealousy and more so letting go of childhood and accepting that we're different people now.", "You don\u2019t think telling your friend that their partner went behind their back and uninvited you because they are insecure about how close you two used to be isn\u2019t going to cause strife in their relationship? Lmao you also think that their partner who went behind their back to tell you not to come to their wedding because they consider you an ex despite never even coming close to dating will be okay with you talking, chatting, and hanging out other places with their partner? Lol k."]}
