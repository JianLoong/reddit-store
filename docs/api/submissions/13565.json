NTA, and do not buy a house with this guy.  If he wants to buy a house have you there as a tenant, that's fine.  But you are thinking very smartly here about the potential need for an escape plan if this goes south.  FWIW my advice would be the same even if there was no kid involved, but your son makes it even more important that your living situation is not tightly bound up with your boyfriend.", "NTA It's completely insane to buy a house with someone that has no legal commitment to your relationship. Renting is not a waste of money especially when you are in a precarious position.", "NTA   \n\n\nI think it's totally logical, especially if you haven't been together for that long. House is a huge commintment. Maybe, if he wants a house that bad, he buy one himself and then you just can pay rent/cover bills, I feel like that would fit both of you.", "NTA - you should recommend he buys a home and sets up a rental agreement for you if this is how you feel. If that's the route you go, he should also look at setting up a prenuptial agreement so that when you do finally decide if he's the right guy, you don't get half his house right away.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a child and a huge responsibility. You need to put yourself first and make decisions which seem most comfortable and practical for you and your child.\n\nDon\u2018t let anyone pressure you into it. You can still buy a house later.", "NTA - don't do anything you're not comfortable with.\n\n\nAlso, who the heck can buy a house at 20/22?  What? Most people still in college", "NTA\n\nBut why not let him buy the house? His name will be on everything. You can live there, paying rent. \n\nIf things go south, you can move out.", "NTA for needing to rent for a while longer. But I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as not having trust for your partner, and maybe thinking of it in those terms is a bit of an impediment. \n\nIf you aren't ready, you aren't ready. Perhaps there is a compromise - such as that you get a 12-month lease together in order to ensure you can live together successfully - and then move towards trying to buy. Or maybe you look for a home together that he buys with an agreement that you will rent from him, but tread carefully with that as that makes him your landlord and your name isn't on the title of ownership. \n\nIMO he should not force this. You're both so young and as you noted you need to also prioritize the stability and wellbeing of your son.", "NTA.\n\nRenting isn't always a waste of money.\n\nYour reasons are totally valid on their own, but also consider this: renting gives you a chance to learn what you want or don't want in a house, without the commitment.", "NTA. Although I think he is right (depending on your country's economy) you still shouldn't move in with him. If you plan on moving in together, you could also let him buy a house on his own and pay your part of the mortgage in form of rent to him. Wouldn't make a difference for you and he would have his house. Just be clear about numbers beforehand. If you can't afford paying half of his mortgage rate, then it doesn't work.", "OK. You are currently living with your parents and your 2 year old son. Before your son was born, you moved in with your son's father, and he was abusive etc. So, understandably, you are nervous about moving in with your new bf.\n\nWhat is your bf's proposal? Is he proposing that he should buy a house, and you should move in with him, or is he proposing that the two of you should buy a house together?\n\nYou need to talk about your feelings with your bf. It sounds like you haven't actually done that. You're nervous about becoming entangled in home ownership with your bf before you're certain that it will work out, and before you intend to make a lifelong commitment to each other. Given your experience, this is an understandable concern. You need to talk to your bf about that. \n\nBecause he's right - given a set of assumptions that might quite likely be true, it would be \"stupid\" to not buy a house. You're not arguing with that statement, and he doesn't understand that. \"Do it right\" is a completely meaningless statement. You need to sit down and talk with him about your experiences and your feelings and concerns. (And in the long term, renting for a year before you buy isn't such a big deal financially.)\n\nNAH", "NTA.  Buying a house is a huge step and investment and should really only be done when 2 people have committed a lifetime to each other.  Note that it doesn\u2019t matter if they are married.  Whatever kind of commitment they want to make that\u2019s right for them is fine.  Renting an apartment is absolutely throwing your money away but it\u2019s worth it to test the waters.  If he wants to buy a house on his own and ask you to move in that might be an idea.  You can see how he treats you in that arrangement and, if it works out, you can always refinance the house so you can add your money and name to it.", "NTA. You've been with this person for a year and a half and aren't sure if you're ready for a long-term commitment and don't want to lock yourself into a situation you might not be able to get out of easily. Completely fair.", "NTA\nHow is he planning to buy a house at 20 anyway?", "NTA for not wanting to buy a house with your BF.  You should NEVER buy such a major purchase without being legally married.  Mainly because if the relationship goes south, you have such a mess.\n\nBetter to rent a place and make sure things will work out, at least in the short term.    \nIf he insists on buying a home, then you pay him rent in the amount you\u2019d pay for your share of rent in a home you like.  So, if rent of an apartment where you want to live would cost you $500 and you agree that your share for you and your child would be $350, then you pay him $350 for rent in the house he buys and HE ALONE obligates himself to.  \n\nMeanwhile, make sure you have an escape plan, just in case your relation ship doesn\u2019t work out.", "NTA. Here's the thing- you two are not even living together yet but are \"steadily\" having an argument \\*and\\* he's apparently talking to his mom about it. He's trying to strongarm you into buying a house. You seem to have a good head on your shoulders- you don't want to make a 30 year commitment to someone just yet. \n\nAlso, houses are crazy expensive right now. He must have a great paying job or family money for a down payment. Sure, buying a house is usually the better option, but you two are not on the same page and you should not get financially committed to him until you are on the same page", "NTA. Never buy a house with someone you aren't married to. If you break up or he stops paying rent, you and your child and screwed. You're right to rent for now, especially if you can't afford to buy a home and pay the mortgage by yourself.", "NTA. \n\n Maybe find a rent to own place?", "NTA\n\nIf that's his only reasoning, then he donest know wtf he's talking about.\n\nOwning a home carries a load of extra costs that take most people by surprise, and anyone you can call to get it fixed is going to charge you.\n\nYou're NTA for not accepting bad, uninformed reasoning to be talked into a decades long financial commitment.", "NTA\n\nIf you dont want to rent, dont rent. If he wants to buy a house he can do that without you. You have your reasons for renting and they're valid.", "NTA - you have WAY too much to lose here, you\u2019re right to be cautious. If he\u2019s so determined to buy, let him, and you can have a tenancy situation, but definitely get a contract of some sort drawn up to state terms. So if he changes his mind, or things go south, you and your kid don\u2019t end up homeless. Your brain is still developing at your age so I wouldn\u2019t be in any rush to move faster.", "NTA especially when you factor in mortgages, property taxes, utilities, maintenance and up keep, (in some areas) HOA\u2019s, etc. He is young and might not have thought out all of this. There is a lot more to home ownership than people think", "NTA. Feeling as you do. Rent is not a waste.  You're playing it safe. And at 20 and 22 do you both have a good down payment saved. Plus, what's the backup plan if a job falls through. More on the table than you BF thinks.", "Why are you making a 20 year old play house with you?

There are advantages to renting, such as upkeep, maintenance, lower rent, etc.  Buying a house locks you into a huge commitment.  Are you prepared to handle the exterior and interior routine upkeep?  Maintenance?  Insurance?  Higher payments (unless you're looking to buy a dive)?  There is no need to rush into this.  We live in a mobile society, and renting gives you that flexibility.  It's worth thinking about.", "NTA.  Typically, if you can\u2019t guarantee you will live in a place for at least five years, it is cheaper to rent.  Between down payments and taxes and upkeep and routine maintenance and paying closing costs twice, it is more expensive than people think and can be an anchor on your future.  I know so many young professionals who moved on and got stuck with the anchor of a house 2-3 jobs back.  You are severely limiting your job prospects when you should be at your most flexible to take advantage of opportunities.\n\nYou have lived on your own.  You know the learning curve.  He will move in with you and expect you to do things like his mom.  He doesn\u2019t know what it is to have all the responsibilities and no oversight.  You are right to be worried about living together and the fact that he doesn\u2019t recognize that demonstrates the issue.\n\nFinally, you are making a huge financial commitment to someone with no legal relationship to you.  That means this is purely a business transaction, not a social one.  You are making an investment in your financial future, not building a home.  Hire a lawyer and protect yourself accordingly.  \n\nIf he really wants a house, let him buy one and pay him a fair roommate rent with a signed lease.  You want to rent.  So that is what you should do.", "NTA, until the BF becomes a fianc\u00e9 who then becomes a hubby you shouldn't buy a house with him. If he can afford a house that's great, but never forget the upkeep and all the other bills that come with owning a home.

There are **locks** to change, in case the previous people made extra keys, and lots of **small hardware things** to change.  There's **painting and repairs** that you don't see before you move in.  There's getting an **inspection** done, and maybe getting a **specialty inspection** done so he doesn't buy a lemon.  There's all the little things the inspections shows that need replaced. There's having **a fund to replace the furnace, or the roof, or get rid of termites, or dry rot,** because anything you uncover might have hidden issues under it; inspections do not catch it all.  There's having that fund cover **plumbing issues** that only showed up after you move in, or finding out that your **electric needs work** done.  Houses cost money, not just a mortgage, but **a constant bit of investment, improvements, repairs,** and making the place work for you.   There's **things like mowers and cleaning supplies, fire alarms and extinguishers, house insurance, yard tools** and things.  Even with house insurance, there's disasters that will cost you.\n\nNot only that, owning a house means **weekly chores** that must be done.

Moving in with a guy when you have already chosen an abusive guy before him is a big risk, as you have a much higher chance of picking the exact same type of guy again. Always, always stick to logic when making decisions. Always have good reasons for doing something. Do not be persuaded against logical decisions by someone who says, 'don't you trust me, if you cared about our future you would do this, don't you love me, if you were invested in the relationship like I am you would want to do this, you obviously don't care about me, you don't care about your child or you'd want him to grow up in a house we own, not a rental etc etc.' Statements like these are manipulative, emotional blackmail and are based on his feelings and not logic and are controlling and big red flags.
