But you are thinking very smartly here about the potential need for an escape plan if this goes south.  FWIW my advice would be the same even if there was no kid involved, but your son makes it even more important that your living situation is not tightly bound up with your boyfriend.", "NTA It's completely insane to buy a house with someone that has no legal commitment to your relationship. Renting is not a waste of money especially when you are in a precarious position.", "NTA   \n\n\nI think it's totally logical, especially if you haven't been together for that long. House is a huge commintment. Maybe, if he wants a house that bad, he buy one himself and then you just can pay rent/cover bills, I feel like that would fit both of you.", "NTA - you should recommend he buys a home and sets up a rental agreement for you if this is how you feel. If that's the route you go, he should also look at setting up a prenuptial agreement so that when you do finally decide if he's the right guy, you don't get half his house right away.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a child and a huge responsibility.

But I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as not having trust for your partner, and maybe thinking of it in those terms is a bit of an impediment. \n\nIf you aren't ready, you aren't ready. Perhaps there is a compromise - such as that you get a 12-month lease together in order to ensure you can live together successfully - and then move towards trying to buy. Or maybe you look for a home together that he buys with an agreement that you will rent from him, but tread carefully with that as that makes him your landlord and your name isn't on the title of ownership. \n\nIMO he should not force this. You're both so young and as you noted you need to also prioritize the stability and wellbeing of your son.", "NTA.\n\nRenting isn't always a waste of money.\n\nYour reasons are totally valid on their own, but also consider this: renting gives you a chance to learn what you want or don't want in a house, without the commitment.", "NTA.

If you plan on moving in together, you could also let him buy a house on his own and pay your part of the mortgage in form of rent to him.

Is he proposing that he should buy a house, and you should move in with him, or is he proposing that the two of you should buy a house together?\n\nYou need to talk about your feelings with your bf. It sounds like you haven't actually done that. You're nervous about becoming entangled in home ownership with your bf before you're certain that it will work out, and before you intend to make a lifelong commitment to each other. Given your experience, this is an understandable concern. You need to talk to your bf about that. \n\nBecause he's right - given a set of assumptions that might quite likely be true, it would be \"stupid\" to not buy a house. You're not arguing with that statement, and he doesn't understand that. \"Do it right\" is a completely meaningless statement.

Whatever kind of commitment they want to make that\u2019s right for them is fine.  Renting an apartment is absolutely throwing your money away but it\u2019s worth it to test the waters.

Here's the thing- you two are not even living together yet but are \"steadily\" having an argument \\*and\\* he's apparently talking to his mom about it.

There is a lot more to home ownership than people think", "NTA. Feeling as you do. Rent is not a waste.  You're playing it safe. And at 20 and 22 do you both have a good down payment saved.

There are advantages to renting, such as upkeep, maintenance, lower rent, etc.  Buying a house locks you into a huge commitment.  Are you prepared to handle the exterior and interior routine upkeep?  Maintenance?  Insurance?  Higher payments (unless you're looking to buy a dive)?  There is no need to rush into this.  We live in a mobile society, and renting gives you that flexibility.  It's worth thinking about.", "NTA.  Typically, if you can\u2019t guarantee you will live in a place for at least five years, it is cheaper to rent.  Between down payments and taxes and upkeep and routine maintenance and paying closing costs twice, it is more expensive than people think and can be an anchor on your future.

There's having **a fund to replace the furnace, or the roof, or get rid of termites, or dry rot,** because anything you uncover might have hidden issues under it; inspections do not catch it all.  There's having that fund cover **plumbing issues** that only showed up after you move in, or finding out that your **electric needs work** done.  Houses cost money, not just a mortgage, but **a constant bit of investment, improvements, repairs,** and making the place work for you.

If he has not had experience living out of the family home then it is going to put even more pressure on the relationship.  \nIf this is the case OP I would be saying \"no\" even more.

Those amounts are pretty standard for my area. MCOL-HCOL.  I paid 5k for a furnace 7 years ago. Mid level.  So it would definitely cost more now.  Got several quotes for a roof last year.  All around 15k.  This is for a small split level.  Definitely not a mansion. That house was appraised for 550k (3bed, 2bath ~1800sq ft)\nIt cost 15k to repair our deck and another 10k for landscape work.", "What is MCOL-HCOL?

BC province.  It could be worse. I could be living in Vancouver area where we would looking at over a million for a single family home.or 750-900k for a 2 bed condo. \n\nThe costs I highlighted are for basic work.

Let him buy it on his own if he wants it. You have a daughter to think of, he doesn\u2019t.\n\nI made that mistake when I turned 18, and pregnant. I bought a house with my then boyfriend and father of my son. He left us. I could not afford the house, and had issues because it was under his name too. In the end, it got repo, and ruined my credit. I had to give my daughter up for adoption, and she is doing great with her new parents. \nMy ex is now together with another woman, living with his parents in a bad part of town.\n\nThis is your life if you buy a home with him.", "NTA.

Right now housing affordability is more or less the worst it has ever been in history. How is a 22 year old with a two year old child and a 20 year old going to afford buying a house?
