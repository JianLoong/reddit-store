He'll have to get himself up and put himself to bed without help. It's worthwhile practicing this beforehand, which really means starting now.\n\nLet him fail. Let him stay up until 3am playing on his phone in his room, and learn how rotten it feels to try and think for a full day of school after 3 hours sleep.

I had a bright social life and regularly hung out with my friends on weekends. I didn\u2019t drink excessively or do drugs because I had no desire to, it wasn\u2019t rebellious or cool because I didn\u2019t have the strict limitations inflicted upon me that my friends did.

I get that you\u2019re trying to set him up for success, but you are hobbling his ability to self regulate and make appropriate choices on his own. \n\nI have two sons (14 & 19) and they both were given the same general directions once they started high school. I prefer them to turn off their electronics an hour before they plan to go to sleep in favor of a quiet activity (reading, drawing\u2026anything without a screen). I have suggested a target bedtime for them and explained my reasoning (what time the school bus arrives, optimal sleep hours according to sleep science, etc), but ultimately I leave it up to them to figure out on their own.  I only step in if a problem appears. \n\nFor example, my younger son went through a spell where he would miss the bus almost every morning. At the end of the week, I sat down with him and TOGETHER we took a look at all the contributing factors in missing the bus.

When I got to highschool  I didn't have a curfew, a set bedtime, or electronic restrictions but I learned to make my own schedule and how to balance fun/school early on so when I got to college it wasn't a complete shock and I managed to balance work/school/fun successfully.

These rules are good when they're young and still figuring things out, but the older they get the more you need to \"let them off the leash,\" so they can learn their own limits.

The reason you should let your teen have more responsibilities and privileges as they get older is because you are preparing them for adulthood. \n\nYour son is going to be at a disadvantage to his peers when he goes to college.  The other kids will have learned how to manage their time and the importance of getting enough sleep, because they\u2019ve had the chance to mess up when they were younger and see how a lack of sleep impacts them.  Your son won\u2019t be like this. He\u2019ll be experiencing \u2018freedom\u2019 for the first time. He\u2019ll be making his mistakes surrounded by kids who have already passed that stage. He\u2019ll be playing catch up\u2026emotionally, maturity wise, and developmental stage wise. \n\nA good example is kids that aren\u2019t allowed to date. They go off to college and have no idea how dating and relationships work. They are at the \u201chold hands with a boy/girl\u201d stage while most of their peers passed that stage years ago. It\u2019s not even about being sexually active (plenty of kids don\u2019t become active until college) it\u2019s about building emotional maturity and confidence. Those kids never got the chance to do that in a relationship where their partner was also at the same age.

He doesn't know if he works better with timers or without, with bullet journals or whiteboard lists or post it notes. Do you think he'll magically know how to manage his time in a year? Will he keep your stretch schedule or will he throw it away with this first breath of freedom ever. \n\nYou should've started easing up on this shit when he started middle school. Him dropping in GPA cause he's learning time management skills is a lot lower stakes in middle and high school than in college. I have ADHD, in middleschool I stayed up til 4 am playing games or reading, I dealt with the consequences of not having enough sleep for a few weeks or months, and I learned how much sleep I was willing to lose for a few hours of gaming, and I rolled it back. I eased up to falling asleep at around 1ish am,  I was still tired but I learned what balance I was okay with.\n\n(And as a very small aside, biologically speaking teenagers circadian rhythms are wired so that they do not feel tired until very late, they're nocturnal by default.

Being open and honest is fundamental to this process and you should not be encouraging him to hide his feelings so that you're not \"thrown under the bus\". I've told my therapist thoughts that I would NEVER tell anyone else. Their entire job is based on not judging their clients. \n\nFor example a (good) therapist isn't going to hear your son say that he wants more freedom and think \"oh what bad parents this kid has\".

He withdrew and shut them out of his life.\n\nOne day his mother told me\"If we go on forcing him, we'll lose him\". They decided to just let him be and show nothing but love and support.

You can\u2019t go from bed time at 9 no pho e in bed to here is the world you do you I ll see you in a few months when term is over \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Just be prepared to get contact cut-off when he turns 18 :')", "Sigh. YTA. I was treated this way at 17, it doesn\u2019t help.", "YTA.    \n\nPut yourself in his shoes. What were you like when you were 17? At that age I had my first heartbreak, I met great people who are still my friends, I partied, I did stuff that normal teenagers do. I\u2019m telling you this as someone who was 17 only 3 years ago. I had friends whose parents were that strict, and let me tell you the moment those kids tasted a little bit of freedom...    \n\nHe\u2019s mature enough to understand right from wrong and even if he does make some kind of mistake that\u2019s completely normal! How will he learn otherwise?    \nAnd by the way, you\u2019re treating him like a 10 year old, I don\u2019t even know 14 year olds who have to be in bed by 10pm.    \nHe\u2019s one year away from being a legal adult.", "Yta", "YTA. Now is when he should be learning his own time management techniques for moving out and going to college. At 17, I\u2019d already moved out and was living alone. Stop treating him like he\u2019s in middle school. He needs to be able to function as a responsible adult shortly and you\u2019re handing him none of those tools", "He\u2019s 17. He thinks you\u2019re treating him like a 14 year old, really you\u2019re treating him like a 5 year old.", "You are trying to keep too tight a rein on him.  Expect him to go off the rails when he goes off to college or development mental health issues because he hasn't learned enough about life.  I wish I was exaggerating, but sadly I've seen both.  YTA", "ugh YTA. let me tell you a fun little anecdote: i have an incredible relationship with my grandmother (who raised me) because she allowed me to have freedom when i could drive, trusted me, and gave me the opportunity to be honest and communicative, and let me do what i want under the pretenses that i let her know where i am and who im with in case anything happens. however when i was younger, i \u201chated\u201d her for being strict, and it encouraged me to act out as a rebellious gesture to try to limit her effort to control me. you are pushing your son away. do not be surprised when he doesn\u2019t call or text while he is in college, and don\u2019t be surprised when he goes off the rails once he is out from under your roof. good luck, your son deserves boundaries and privacy. you sounds like the type of parent who is emotionally incestuous and feels threatened by your sons girlfriends", "Dude your kid is 17 and a senior? Does he have the absolute worst GPA? Is he on the fast track to a life under a bridge? Hell by the time I was 17 my parents just wanted me to get 6 hours of sleep and wake up on time to drive myself to school. Back the fuck up and let your bear adult son be a bear adult. Y'all do realize if y'all signed with him he can enlist? But he can't play a couple of games and have his phone? What y'all gonna be at his house at 4 in the morning 20 years from now laying out his clothes and making breakfast? Yta let the hell up and give him some personal space", "My parents treated me like this over a 2 year period. No phone in bed, bedtime, 1hour of laptop use everyday, including homework. Safe to say I found a way around all of that and just resented them so so much more. You are not reasonable.", "NTA  - I'm a high school teacher and parent of teenagers. All the responses saying he can suffer the natural consequences are forgetting that most 17 year olds will make the rest of the family suffer along with them by being irritable the next day. You are teaching him how to care for himself. He can \"practice\" having the phone overnight this summer, before he leaves for college, if that's his next step.", "Let him make his own decisions so that he can learn natural consequences. YTA", "Yes, yea you are!", "Hard agree. I was kept under lock and key, and when I hit 18 I was left to \u201cfend for yourself, you\u2019re an adult now\u201d and kicked out of the only home I had known since 10 years old when I was adopted by them. Went to live with bio mom, got hooked on one night stands, smoked weed with random strangers, partied like a 2000s Fake ID holding teens in a club movie, eventually moved out of there to a bigger city, dropped out of college to be a stripper and started to experiment with coke, meth, you name it I tried it. My boss was probably some mafia guy, always had shady shit going on but I had an apartment funded by him and a job that paid for all the food I had. Place got shot up while I was there, so I ran and moved in with another friend rent free, crashed there for a few months, drunk off my ass and assuaged by a \u201cgay\u201d guy who\u2019s dad blamed me and kicked me out. Now I\u2019m stable thank GODS but fuck man, if they had given me even the slightest bit of control in my life\u2026. Even now I struggle to make decisions for myself because I\u2019m legit terrified someone will get mad at me for the choice I make, even the smallest thing alike what fast food stop we wanna hit on a road trip (wife and I take turns) and yes, I am in therapy for this. OP, unless you want your son to become a drug addled party kid with no direction in life and no means to an end on how to fix it\u2026 I suggest you loosen up on the reigns. He\u2019s 17, he\u2019s mature enough to make his own decisions and learn the consequences of those choices. One more year and he\u2019s a legal adult. I can almost guarantee your household is a \u201cour house our rules\u201d place. Hell leave and ignore you for the rest of your life if you don\u2019t start being proactive about his mental health and learning how to be emotionally AND mentally mature. u/throwaway5720120", "I\u2019ve been this kid. OP is setting up his child to rebel. YTA", "The blue light thing is an urban myth, or at least not proven/disproven yet. Apparently at most they estimate maybe 5-10 mins extra before sleep. Mostly it\u2019s the stimulation you\u2019re getting from what ever is on the blue light. He needs to learn to self regulate his stimulation. Harder with adhd but also easier now with all the easily accessible info and tricks for adhd coping.

Don't you understand the concept?", "These are the rules for my kid, too. She's a responsible and self reliant young person.", "I just has to let my parents know who, where, and what, otherwise they let me do as I wished. I am a very boring person so they never felt it was necessary to crack down.", "Why is his bf being trans at all relevant? Are you saying it because you can't cope with him being gay?", "If he fails in college, it will be mostly because of how you raised him", "See, that's the thing. \nYou can offer him self regulation in order to prep him for college and adult life but can combine that with still achieving his grades. \nIt'd be a good compromise, don't you think? \n\nI think we often forget that kids and teens are humans as well and he seems very smart and concerned about the right things, tbh. I'm impressed! \n(Also he might game with his friends so it might be a mix of gaming but also socializing with his griend group).", "Then why on Earth are you treating him like a toddler who can\u2019t be responsible?", "I wonder if they're in denial about him being gay and want to point out the bf isn't REALLY a guy (in their brains)."]}
