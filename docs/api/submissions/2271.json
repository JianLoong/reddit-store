He'll have to get himself up and put himself to bed without help. It's worthwhile practicing this beforehand, which really means starting now.\n\nLet him fail. Let him stay up until 3am playing on his phone in his room, and learn how rotten it feels to try and think for a full day of school after 3 hours sleep.

I had a bright social life and regularly hung out with my friends on weekends. I didn\u2019t drink excessively or do drugs because I had no desire to, it wasn\u2019t rebellious or cool because I didn\u2019t have the strict limitations inflicted upon me that my friends did.

I get that you\u2019re trying to set him up for success, but you are hobbling his ability to self regulate and make appropriate choices on his own. \n\nI have two sons (14 & 19) and they both were given the same general directions once they started high school. I prefer them to turn off their electronics an hour before they plan to go to sleep in favor of a quiet activity (reading, drawing\u2026anything without a screen). I have suggested a target bedtime for them and explained my reasoning (what time the school bus arrives, optimal sleep hours according to sleep science, etc), but ultimately I leave it up to them to figure out on their own.  I only step in if a problem appears. \n\nFor example, my younger son went through a spell where he would miss the bus almost every morning. At the end of the week, I sat down with him and TOGETHER we took a look at all the contributing factors in missing the bus.

When I got to highschool  I didn't have a curfew, a set bedtime, or electronic restrictions but I learned to make my own schedule and how to balance fun/school early on so when I got to college it wasn't a complete shock and I managed to balance work/school/fun successfully.

These rules are good when they're young and still figuring things out, but the older they get the more you need to \"let them off the leash,\" so they can learn their own limits.

The reason you should let your teen have more responsibilities and privileges as they get older is because you are preparing them for adulthood. \n\nYour son is going to be at a disadvantage to his peers when he goes to college.  The other kids will have learned how to manage their time and the importance of getting enough sleep, because they\u2019ve had the chance to mess up when they were younger and see how a lack of sleep impacts them.  Your son won\u2019t be like this. He\u2019ll be experiencing \u2018freedom\u2019 for the first time. He\u2019ll be making his mistakes surrounded by kids who have already passed that stage. He\u2019ll be playing catch up\u2026emotionally, maturity wise, and developmental stage wise. \n\nA good example is kids that aren\u2019t allowed to date. They go off to college and have no idea how dating and relationships work. They are at the \u201chold hands with a boy/girl\u201d stage while most of their peers passed that stage years ago. It\u2019s not even about being sexually active (plenty of kids don\u2019t become active until college) it\u2019s about building emotional maturity and confidence. Those kids never got the chance to do that in a relationship where their partner was also at the same age. This creates a big experience/maturity imbalance when they start dating. \n\nIf you\u2019re strict with phone/bedtimes, I\u2019m betting you\u2019re strict with social activities too. Just be aware this can handicap your child as they transition to adulthood. You don\u2019t need to let your child run around with no rules, but you need to give them the chance to learn how to be responsible for themselves. And that really only comes with practice.", "Most phones & tablets have blue light filters that you can turn on. If his device doesn't have one, there are add-on filters. I think they stick on like a screen protector.", "Yeah, that is true. I do feel like 10 is a little early for a 17 year old to go to bed. My 12 and 14 year old go to bed at 10 on school nights. It doesn\u2019t make you an AH though. Just be careful not to be too restrictive which can cause them to go overboard at 18 or the first chance they get. They need to be able to regulate themselves by then.", "This comment just shows that you and your wife are treating him like a toddler. Having a bedtime for a 17 yr old also says that you do not trust him enough to know his own body. Do you take his phone at bedtime too? That\u2019s very disrespectful. Especially since other comments you\u2019ve made said he is a good kid and a good student. \n\nDefinitely YTA.", "It's not throwing you under the bus if it's true.", "Why do you think he threw you under the bus? Are the household rules a secret? He is 17 and you don\u2019t trust  him with the small decisions how is he supposed to have the confidence to deal with the larger decisions. I have a 15 year so I get how hard it can be to relinquish control but is it better for him to fail at home with a safety net (you and mom) or on his own when the consequences will be more severe?", "That's not really throwing you under the bus, that's just expressing what he wishes. \n\nI do think it's time to give him more privileges but maybe also more responsibilities...? My now 17 yr old doesn't have a bedtime or any set schedule. He does have rules though- getting to school on time (he drives himself), keeping his room slightly clean, laundry done weekly (and put away, which seems to be a problem area lol), pay his bills, school before work but he does work right now (if his grades go down significantly, he'll be forced to quit). I prefer him home by 10pm on school nights but as long as he lets me know where he is, I'm okay with it... same with the weekends, no actual curfew but I need to know where you are. (Sometimes he works until 11 on school nights).", "Bringing up valid complaints in therapy isn't throwing you under the bus. The point of therapy is to find and solve the problem, not to protect failing parenting  (yeah, I'm talking about you). How are you helping him to be an independent adult?", "Does he get in trouble a lot or are you just strict?", "What he speaks to his therapist about is none of your business as long as nobody\u2019s safety is in jeopardy.  Please let him at least have freedom of thought if you can\u2019t allow him the normal freedoms of the average 17 year old.  \n\nThe tighter you try to hold onto some things, the more damage you cause.  He sounds like a good kid, hasn\u2019t he earned your trust?", "Why was a parent present during therapy?", "Your son isn\u2019t throwing you under the bus when he\u2019s being honest about his feelings with his therapist.", "What do you expect your son to do once he graduates highschool?", "I don\u2019t think you limiting his screen time before bed is bad but what else did y\u2019all do that was so strict it caused him depression? \ud83d\udc80", "Here\u2019s what you and your wife are missing. It\u2019s not about privileges, it\u2019s about teaching your kid how to make decisions, about managing their resources (including tins like energy, health, etc), abs taking responsibilities for natural consequences. \n\nHad you and your wife slowly provided him with autonomy and agency over things like curfew, bed time, etc\u2026 starting at about 15 - he would have been able to test out making good decisions and bad decisions and the consequences of both of those things in a *safe* environment, where he had the cushion of the two of you to help talk him through things, help moderate him and advise him in his decisions and make sure he follows through in commitments even if he\u2019s\u2026 I don\u2019t know exhausted or hungover from bad decisions. \n\nHe would have felt a sense of autonomy and like you trusted him, but he\u2019d also know he can trust himself to make good decisions when he\u2019s in his own next year in college. \n\nInstead, you prevented that. So two things are likely to happen. First, his first taste of any of his own agency is also going to be the first time he had no supervision AND no support. The most common response kids have to this is\u2026 well over doing it. \n\nThe second us he\u2019s going to be sent it into the world and discover that in college he needs to make ALL the decisions (bed time, go to class, get drunk, use condoms during sex, actually turn in school work and study\u2026 etc. etc. Or not do those things.) all the time - with no guidance (and gets sue not going to trust the two of you to give him haha off guidance because you\u2019ve been nothing but over controlling) and he\u2019s going to discover that suddenly being saddled with all of that is often overwhelming and exhausting. Because you and your wife failed to help him begin to do all that \u201cwith training wheels\u201d as a teen it\u2019s going to be that much harder for him. \n\nHe didn\u2019t \u201cthrow you under the bus\u201d at the therapist, he talked about what he\u2019s struggling with and the therapist made it clear that YOU are making a mistake by having a stranglehold on him as if he\u2019s not about to be an adult. You felt blindsided, not by your kid or his feelings, but because the therapist agreed with him and not you. \n\nYour job was not to restrain him, it was to teach him to be an adult. YTA if you don\u2019t get your head in straight and start doing that, because your strict parenting isn\u2019t helping him, it\u2019s only going to hinder him.", "Having a flashback to my freshman roommate whose mom called every morning at 6 am as a human alarm clock and who came every weekend to do my roommate's laundry and ORGANIZE THEIR CLOSET.", "He has ADHD and gets hyperfixated. Sometimes he won't stop thinking about the game he was playing and he can't sleep.", "We did let him go to his boyfriend's house yesterday. (Trans, ftm) Its mostly during the weekends but when he is here with him, door stays open. We are not as restrictive with his social activities. Thank you for the advice.", "He mentioned that to my wife recently. He said he believes that once he goes to college, not being used to \"having freedom\" will cause him to not have self-regulating skills, which we somewhat understand.", "By getting in trouble, are you referring to school discipline or us punishing him?", "Maybe it was a family therapy session", "YIKES! I wonder how that roomie turned out...", "And that somehow stops before 9pm?", "I have ADHD and you can't control whether you're going to fixate on something OR what you fixate on.\n\nSometimes I fixate on the shadows on my ceiling at night. Sometimes its on all the stuff that's happened during the day. Sometimes its on a conversation I had 3 weeks ago.\n\nThis is not how you manage ADHD, and he's of an age now where he needs to work out what works for him. Since he's not neurotypical it may not be what works for most kids.\n\nFor example, gaming can be a way to self soothe and self medicate. Our brains constantly want dopamine and gaming is a quick way to get it. You need to trust him to put in processes that help him stop when he's got what he needs (not ban the games outright).\n\nAlso almost all ADHD people I know are night owls, because our systems are dysregulated. You're probably doing him more harm then good by forcing him to go to bed before he's ready to sleep. Hell, he's probably fixating on something because he can't sleep and has no other stimulation because he's lying in bed trying to sleep.", "yeah that happens. but he should learn to deal with that on his own. by his age I was (usually) able to corral my ADHD brain weasels and sleep, but I also take melatonin and sometimes drink chamomile tea to help me sleep. you've gotta let him figure out a system that works for him", "That\u2019s good. Keeping the door open is a common rule that I bet his friends all have too. And it\u2019s awesome that you\u2019re accepting of his boyfriend. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re restrictive about the phone/bedtime because of his ADHD. Some parents get so used to managing their child\u2019s symptoms that it\u2019s really hard to step back and let their child learn to manage their own symptoms. Especially when they know their child will struggle.  \n\nYou sound like a good parent, just struggling a bit. I think your son going to therapy is great. Maybe you and the other parent can have sessions with him on occasion about how to move forward and have less restrictions while still making sure he\u2019s doing well.  As long as you all care for each other, and treat each other with respect, your son will end up just fine.", "He\u2019s totally right. You should try to let him regulate himself. See how he does. See if his grades slip. You can\u2019t hold his hand next year.", "My parents had a strict sleep schedule for me. It did me ZERO fucking favors when I got to college and many of the courses in my major were only available from 6-10:30 pm, with the computer lab for those courses only reliably available after classes were done for the day until 1am.\n\nIt isn't even about self regulation. It's about living in the realm of reality.", "Either or.", "You got me there.", "I understand. He is incredibly intelligent, he's in the top 10% of his class. We don't want his grades to slip, and we are afraid if we let him have his phone in his room/game excessively it will hurt his grades.", "He is a fantastic student. Never gotten in trouble once, 3.8 GPA. 32 ACT, 1420 SAT. Top 10% of his class. As for us punishing him, if he disobeys then we will take things away.", "Do you think maybe you could explain your reasoning to your son, and discuss and create reasonable rules, routines and how to manage it, but not punish or enforce rules for a time period and see what happens? If he's going away for college, he's going to need to know how to self regulate and manage his time, so having you create and enforce those rules without you there.", "I doubt that will happen.", "You have zero trust in your son. He has excellent grades and you aren't allowing him age appropriate independence because you're afraid his grades *might* slip?? As in NOT \"we tried it before and it went terribly\"???\n\nGrades aren't the end all be all. Where are these child's life skills? Have you bothered cultivating those? Self control? Regulation? Understanding natural consequences? All of those skills are learned through age appropriate independence.", "Would you rather his grades slip a little bit now while he's in high school, or in his freshman year of college when he has less structure and support?", "Wow talk bout helicopter parents. This kid is like students I've seen in college. They finally have leash off them and either do one of two things. Party like crazy or low contact with family because they babied them.\nYou do know your 17 year old is probably being bullied. No.. not probably is. Because mommy and daddy has to have a bedtime for him and he can't play video games with his friends if he has them.", "Do you value your sons personality and mental health? Cause all I\u2019m seeing are the  academics and that he\u2019s obedient - which doesn\u2019t scream \u201cI love and support you unconditionally\u201d to me, it instead sends the message \u201cwe care but with conditions\u201d", "Yikes then yes YTA and way beyond too strict.", "I will talk to my wife about it. I got absolutely obliterated in these comments, so I think it probably is time to ease up. Thanks for your help.", "Also grades aren't everything. Good grades don't mean much if you're social skills are so poor that you can't interview well, don't work in teams very well. They also won't help if you can't self regulate your emotions, or set your own boundaries, or motivate yourself to do your work.\n\nIt's pretty easy to get a certification that will let you work. It's harder to learn how to be an adult."]}
