Most times, our cans weren\u2019t picked up or the bags next to the cans would be ripped apart and then our landlord would get mad at us for making the area in front of our apartment \u201cmessy\u201d. \n\nWe moved out of our junior year apartment in June. In cleaning out my room, I had gathered a few bags of clothing that I wanted to donate and I put them in the hall outside my room. Roommate asked what I was doing and I let her know. She nodded and walked away. A day or two later, bags of clothes were outside of her room.\n\nWhen my mom was coming to pick me up, I took the bags of clothes to donate to my car. My roommate asked if I could take her bags of clothes to throw out. She was flying home and couldn\u2019t take them herself. I asked her if she meant donate. She shook her head no, saying that these clothes \u201cwere personal\u201d to her and she didn\u2019t want to know other people were wearing them. I rolled my eyes but said sure.\n\nWhen I got home, my little sister (16F) asked to go through the clothes before they were donated. I said yes. That afternoon, I took all of the bags of clothes to be donated \u2014 including my roommates. I figured she\u2019d never know, and what she didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt her. \n\nAnyways, flash forward to now. She comes to visit. My sister is wearing her shirt. Roommate recognizes it but says \u201cOh, I used to have it\u201d. Sister spills the beans that it was from the bags of clothes. Now my roommate isn\u2019t talking to me because she said her clothes were special to her and she wanted them thrown out. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that deep, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to throw out perfectly good clothes. \nAITA for donating clothes instead of throwing them out?", "created_utc": 1689947509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155onlp/aita_for_donating_my_roommates_clothes/", "score": 1810, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You wouldn't even know if they were suitable for donating without letting your sister open the bags to rummage through first. It's not about donating vs. throwing away, it's about the fact you essentially agreed one thing (even when you checked she said throw them out, and you still took them, so any reasonable person would take from that that you agreed to do her the favour she asked and throw them out for her) and did another thing directly contrary to her wishes.", "YTA. You\u2019re old enough to know better. This is negligence, plain and simple. In these situations, you ALWAYS cover your ass. Be more discreet. Warn your sister that your roommate is crazy. Lie. Say the bags got mixed up and apologize profusely for being a silly billy. Don\u2019t be an AH to yourself. Now you have an unnecessary headache. Shame on you.\n\nEdit- Like another commenter said, the anger probably is probably more due to a breach of trust, rather than the donation itself. As someone who used to have a similar roommate, be more discreet or just refuse if it\u2019s against your principles. It\u2019s not worth the drama, even if it is a ton of clothes. \u2639\ufe0f", "YTA- You know what her wishes were. You lied that you would do what was requested (throw them out) because \"what she wont know what hurt\"", "\nShe explicitly said she doesn\u2019t want her clothes donated. You decided you don\u2019t give a shit and donated them anyway and figured she\u2019d never find out. Like how are you not the asshole? \n\nIf you had such an issue with those clothes being thrown out, then don\u2019t just roll your eyes and say sure to your roommate. Talk to her about it, argue with her if needed. But remember that its still her clothes and she has the right to decide how her own things get disposed off.\n\nInstead you just made yourself into a liar. You showed her that you were willing to ignore her wishes and lie to her face if you thought you knew better.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t talk to you either if I was your friend. Quite frankly, I wouldn\u2019t trust someone who\u2019d do something like this. Sure its just clothes, but if someone was willing to lie to me over some dumb clothes, its kind of hard to continue trust that person on anything else knowing that they\u2019re perfectly willing to lie to me and disregard my wishes to get their way.", "YTA, she is also being unreasonably possessive over her own clothing and it probably has to do with the fact that she's an only child never had to share her entire life, but either way, her clothes, her choice.\n\nYou specifically asked her if she wants to donate her clothes.\n\nShe made it clear as day no.\n\nYou literally just had to add after her saying no \"I'm not going to throw perfectly good clothes out, if you are letting me deal with these clothes, I will be donating them.\"\n\nand then it'll be perfectly fine with your actions.\n\nInstead, you said \"sure\" while your actions choosing to ignore her clear as day instructions as to what to do with her clothes without communicating with her, and quite frankly, it's going to create trust issues.\n\nedit: just because something is not deep to you, doesn't mean it's also not a big deal to someone else.

It\u2019s laughable to think she had a valid reason for this. \n\nIf we really want to get technical, it wasn\u2019t a lie at all. Once something is trash then it\u2019s up for grabs so all OP was doing was legally claiming trash. I highly doubt that her friend specified that it need to physically be put in a landfill and left there forever. Now that OP has said trash in their possession, they are free to donate it.

You think you\u2019re shutting down my argument by presenting a hypothetical, implying that I should have already taken it into account.

In this comment I explicitly said \u201cThey\u2019re not blind, they will pick up on a volunteer\u2019s disgust or reluctance, and it\u2019s demeaning. It\u2019s supposed to be a place of safety.\u201d\n\nYou feel the need to specify \u201ckeeping her mouth shut\u201d and \u201cnot gawking,\u201d but how in the hell are you gonna guarantee that the ignorant privileged girl who would rather throw out her clothes than donate them and doesn\u2019t understand why that is a problem is *NOT* going to gawk at them?! In case it is not abundantly clear, I am speaking from experience here. People who get dragged into these scenarios generally do NOT hide it well. \n\nDeliberately trying to somehow get around this or suggest that it doesn\u2019t matter the approach as long as these people get their laundry done and their food ladled by a compassionless zombie then we have somehow sufficiently fulfilled our \u201cmoral standard\u201d gives me the same feeling as when I hear people say \u201cjust take them to a homeless shelter.\u201d\n\nAs for the REST of your complaint\u2026 I have, actually, demonstrated this. And the argument is pretty conceptually basic.  Lemme copy and paste my exact wording one more (third) time (in a row):\n\n> The point of a homeless shelter is to give them as much dignity in their living situation as possible. **Bringing in a rich person to be humbled and realize how good they have it in comparison is the precise opposite of that.**\n\nThe very foundation of it, the approach in itself is an insult to their human dignity. It just is. Full stop. \n\n> you\u2019re arguing semantics without a point, and it reeks of virtue signaling.\n\nThe semantics ARE the point. Everyone\u2019s answer to spoiled rich people is \u201ctake them to a homeless shelter so they can really FEEL their privilege.\u201d But how often does someone actually take the time to do that? Stop being lazy and acting like dragging them to see homeless people live in poverty is the answer. Grow a damn pair and engage with them yourself, do some work of taking them to task yourself, and not by dancing around the point or leaving it up to homeless people to make it for you.    \n\nThis person began by saying \u201ctake\u201d them to a homeless shelter to \u201csee how they live.\u201d That\u2019s not just a semantics issue. That reveals that the overall motive here is to teach this rich young woman a lesson. And I have SEEN this approach be offensive to the dignity of people at homeless shelters. There are other ways to hear from the impoverished, the formerly homeless, aid workers, etc about her privilege. At the very least do this BEFORE taking her to a homeless shelter to volunteer her time. \n\nAnd you phrasing it as \u201clearning from\u201d the people at the shelter.. they\u2019re not there to *teach.* That\u2019s the point. Engaging in meaningful conversations with those who are willing to have them is valuable, but this can\u2019t be the front line in teaching someone a lesson if you\u2019re not sure they\u2019re actually open to learning one. \n\nAnd it\u2019s funny you call it \u201cvirtue signalling.\u201d Because that\u2019s what I think every time someone says \u201ctake them to a homeless shelter.\u201d Speaking of semantics and virtue signalling, it\u2019s amazing that everyone arguing with me is using unnecessarily sophisticated and sometimes superfluous language. Come on. \u201cLargesse?\u201d \u201cSolipsistic?\u201d \n\nSpeaking of which\u2026\n\n> Immanuel Kant didn\u2019t say \u201cnever treat people as a means,\u201d he said \u201cnever treat people simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.\u201d  \n\nGood thing Immanuel Kant is the supreme authority on what is or is not offensive to homeless people. \n\nAnd way to act like I\u2019m somehow not keeping the \u201cend\u201d of positively impacting the homeless in mind, when that is all that my arguments have done, and they managed to do it *without* using random people at a homeless shelter as a \u201cmeans\u201d for achieving it. \n\n> If a woman being taken to see people in order to change her attitude causes her to start helping those people, this action has satisfied this ~~time tested moral standard.~~ [vague quotation from a dead guy].\n\nI\u2019m actively defending human dignity AND advocating for these populations, encouraging people to do something and suggesting a variety of specific ways to approach checking privilege while doing the least harm. And you\u2019re ..
