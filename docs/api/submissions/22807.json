Three living arrangements later, a couple other roommates along the way, we\u2019re still very good friends. That said, she\u2019s very mad at me right now. \n\nPrior to the story it\u2019s important to note that we had countless issues with the trash pick-up this year. Most times, our cans weren\u2019t picked up or the bags next to the cans would be ripped apart and then our landlord would get mad at us for making the area in front of our apartment \u201cmessy\u201d. \n\nWe moved out of our junior year apartment in June. In cleaning out my room, I had gathered a few bags of clothing that I wanted to donate and I put them in the hall outside my room. Roommate asked what I was doing and I let her know. She nodded and walked away. A day or two later, bags of clothes were outside of her room.\n\nWhen my mom was coming to pick me up, I took the bags of clothes to donate to my car. My roommate asked if I could take her bags of clothes to throw out. She was flying home and couldn\u2019t take them herself. I asked her if she meant donate. She shook her head no, saying that these clothes \u201cwere personal\u201d to her and she didn\u2019t want to know other people were wearing them. I rolled my eyes but said sure.\n\nWhen I got home, my little sister (16F) asked to go through the clothes before they were donated. I said yes. That afternoon, I took all of the bags of clothes to be donated \u2014 including my roommates. I figured she\u2019d never know, and what she didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt her. \n\nAnyways, flash forward to now. She comes to visit. My sister is wearing her shirt. Roommate recognizes it but says \u201cOh, I used to have it\u201d. Sister spills the beans that it was from the bags of clothes. Now my roommate isn\u2019t talking to me because she said her clothes were special to her and she wanted them thrown out. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that deep, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to throw out perfectly good clothes. \nAITA for donating clothes instead of throwing them out?", "created_utc": 1689947509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155onlp/aita_for_donating_my_roommates_clothes/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has she never heard of hand-me-downs in families???", "My vote definitely represents my own humble upbringings, but NTA. There is no reason to throw them out, plain and simple. Wasting anything is ridiculous, whether it\u2019s food, water, or material possessions.", "NTA. This \u201cif I can\u2019t have it, no one can\u201d is wasteful and childish.", "NTA. Once an item is designated as trash, it\u2019s fair game.", "Not necessarily the asshole, but just a really dumb idea. \n\nIf you know your friend doesn\u2019t want other people to wear her clothes, why on gods green earth would you let your sister take some? You set yourself up for this. \n\nYour friend is ridiculous and wasteful. I think the best thing you could have done was donate it somewhere and then lied. You could have said you threw it away and she likely never would have known the difference. She was asking you to do her a favor, the least you could have done is pretend you actually did what she said. She\u2019s comfy, you\u2019re comfy, the end. \n\nNTA but you can\u2019t be surprised when she gets upset that you went directly against her wishes when doing her a favor in such an obvious way. Come on lol.", "NTA. Your lie totally wasn't worth it, for either of you, since you knew her position. That quibble aside, your room mate is ridiculous, IMO. Clothing in good condition should be passed to someone who'll use it, not thrown in a land fill, FFS. (ETA: If it's personal, it's a keepsake and should be, you know, kept...)", "NTA.\n\nDid you technically not do as she asked? Sure. But she is asking a favor of you, not really explaining it, and then throwing out perfectly good clothes for no reason. If it was that important to her she should have explained why, or done it herself", "NTA. I just cannot abide calling you an AH. She was doing a terrible thing by being so wasteful. She filled up 6 garbage bags full of clothes and wanted them to be put in the garbage. I am sure she went home and bought new clothes and is going to toss them out as well. Obviously I know corporations are making the worst of the environmental impacts and disasters, but it doesn\u2019t mean you should be so wasteful.

I\u2019m just gonna gloss over the fact that her request was weird as heck, but I don\u2019t really think you did anything wrong honestly. \n\nShe can\u2019t still own them when she\u2019s given them to the landfill. That\u2019s not really how it works is it?  I bet there\u2019s some law on the  books that would clear this all up actually. I\u2019m just not going to go look for it myself.", "NTA. If she was so adamant about throwing things away she could have done so herself. It seems weird and greedy to throw things out rather than let others have the benefit of them. It is also bad ecologically.\n\nMaybe you shouldn't have let your sister sort through the stuff first, or given her a heads up about wearing the stuff while roommate was around.\n\nI guess technically you were wrong, but I don't know if I would want to live with that person again. (I've worked at an animal shelter and people have wanted their animals put down rather than adopted out. Because they were theirs. This is like a mild form of the same thing. It creeps me out.)", "Well this is a 50/50 to me. Your rm didnt want her clothes to be worn by others but you didnt listened to her but some people out here need it.\nNo a holes here", "ESH. Your roommate is ridiculous, but you did lie to her and then also were dumb to let someone wear an item right in front of her. Maybe she has some weird hangup about seeing the clothes. You didn\u2019t behave in a trustworthy manner.", "INFO\n\nWhy didn't she want the clothes donating?\n\nThrowing them away seems wasteful especially if they were good quality.", "NTA it was wrong to let her think you did as she wanted. however seeing that she had no issues with others borrowing and nothing was sentimental she\u2019s kinda TA for demanding perfectly good clothes be thrown in the trash.  that mindset of because she didn\u2019t want the things anymore no one could have them is off putting and comes across as spoiled", "Nta", "You lied and your roommate is just ridiculous,  being possessive of clothes she was literally sending to the landfill and that she left for you to deal with. \n\nI should say  E S H but her preference for binning the clothes rather than risk her precious garments being in someone else's closet is too irritating for me. NTA", "ESH. She sucks for not being willing to donate the clothes, but the fact is you lied directly to her face and it is reasonable for her to be angry at you for that. If you weren't willing to throw the clothes away you should have just told her to deal with them herself", "It\u2019s people like your roommate that are absolutely killing the planet with wastefulness. \n\nNTA - keep looking after your neighbors, family, and less fortunate. Those that willfully waste deserve no heed to their entitled demands.", "NTA. There\u2019s already so much trash in the world. But I can understand why she\u2019s angry. You violated her trust in a way. Even if throwing away perfect good clothes seems nuts to us, it was important to her. I would sincerely apologize if the friendship is important. You did lie to her.", "NTA", "YTA here, not a big one though.\n\nIt all seemed pretty innocuous until you told her you would throw them out and then didn't. \n\nIt might be something small to lie about but it doesn't seem like there was really much reason for it? I personally wouldn't be as upset as she seems to be about the situation but I assume she's mostly upset at the break of trust rather than the specific scenario in question.", "Those clothes were not yours to dispose of as you wished, she said she wanted them thrown out instead of donating and by taking them you agreed to do as she asked - and then didn't. You wouldn't even know if they were suitable for donating without letting your sister open the bags to rummage through first. It's not about donating vs. throwing away, it's about the fact you essentially agreed one thing (even when you checked she said throw them out, and you still took them, so any reasonable person would take from that that you agreed to do her the favour she asked and throw them out for her) and did another thing directly contrary to her wishes.", "YTA. You\u2019re old enough to know better. This is negligence, plain and simple. In these situations, you ALWAYS cover your ass. Be more discreet. Warn your sister that your roommate is crazy. Lie. Say the bags got mixed up and apologize profusely for being a silly billy. Don\u2019t be an AH to yourself. Now you have an unnecessary headache. Shame on you.\n\nEdit- Like another commenter said, the anger probably is probably more due to a breach of trust, rather than the donation itself. As someone who used to have a similar roommate, be more discreet or just refuse if it\u2019s against your principles. It\u2019s not worth the drama, even if it is a ton of clothes. \u2639\ufe0f", "YTA- You know what her wishes were. You lied that you would do what was requested (throw them out) because \"what she wont know what hurt\"", "\nShe explicitly said she doesn\u2019t want her clothes donated. You decided you don\u2019t give a shit and donated them anyway and figured she\u2019d never find out. Like how are you not the asshole? \n\nIf you had such an issue with those clothes being thrown out, then don\u2019t just roll your eyes and say sure to your roommate. Talk to her about it, argue with her if needed. But remember that its still her clothes and she has the right to decide how her own things get disposed off.\n\nInstead you just made yourself into a liar. You showed her that you were willing to ignore her wishes and lie to her face if you thought you knew better.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t talk to you either if I was your friend. Quite frankly, I wouldn\u2019t trust someone who\u2019d do something like this. Sure its just clothes, but if someone was willing to lie to me over some dumb clothes, its kind of hard to continue trust that person on anything else knowing that they\u2019re perfectly willing to lie to me and disregard my wishes to get their way.", "YTA, she is also being unreasonably possessive over her own clothing and it probably has to do with the fact that she's an only child never had to share her entire life, but either way, her clothes, her choice.\n\nYou specifically asked her if she wants to donate her clothes.\n\nShe made it clear as day no.\n\nYou literally just had to add after her saying no \"I'm not going to throw perfectly good clothes out, if you are letting me deal with these clothes, I will be donating them.\"\n\nand then it'll be perfectly fine with your actions.\n\nInstead, you said \"sure\" while your actions choosing to ignore her clear as day instructions as to what to do with her clothes without communicating with her, and quite frankly, it's going to create trust issues.\n\nedit: just because something is not deep to you, doesn't mean it's also not a big deal to someone else.

At that point she had them in bags and out in the hallway. If you're throwing it away anyways, why not donate the good clothes?", "Because once she\u2019s thrown them out they\u2019re no longer hers. Consciously adding to landfill waste rather than repurposing the clothes would be an ah move", "Love that people actually came to defend the wastefulness here. Your privilege is showing hard. I\u2019d veto this any day of my life if it means somebody who needs clothes gets them instead of letting them rot in a dump. Sometimes one has to do something against other\u2019s wishes and it doesn\u2019t make them TA just because it isn\u2019t what was asked.", "Then she could have thrown it away herself if she was that worried about donating \ud83d\ude44", "One man's trash is another man's treasure. Once someone has deemed stuff trash and made it obvious they don't want it anymore it's wrong to let that shit go to waste when millions of people struggle to buy things they need like clothes. What if it was food that was still completely edible like unopened cans of vegetables and unopened box meals? Wanting to keep items other people need out of their hands _despite not wanting or needing the item yourself_ makes you an asshole, especially if the only reason you don't want to help others is because \"well it was mine first and even though it won't be anymore because I literally do not want it, I still don't want you to have it\".", "She needs to get a grip.  Take her to visit a local homeless shelter so she can see how some people actually live.", "He said he didn't want anyone else to wear them, but there was no way to guarantee that once you put them in a landfill other than incinerating them, he didn't. I'm just going to point out that his request was weird, but I don't really think you did anything wrong to be honest.", "it\u2019s really not that big of a deal your roommate is being ridiculous. throwing away bags of clothes would have made you an ah", "Then yeah, YTA", "Mild NTA, I would also hate wasting perfectly good clothes knowing they could be given away or donated so someone else could use them. So I understand why you did what you did.  \n\n\nBut your roommate was clear about what they wanted, and you lied to them. If you were uncomfortable with throwing away perfectly good clothes, then you could have argued with your roommate or refused to do it, and make her do the deed.   \n\n\nI don't think lying to your roommate is justified by the fact you thought it was a waste.", "I think the point is maybe you should've just told her that. Commenter is saying the issue might be that you lied, not necessarily the actions themselves but that you lied to her. I'm upset when my loved ones lie to me. You probably should've just explained it to her instead of lying.", "Then instead of taking the bags you should have said you were happy to take them to be donated but if she wants to just dispose of them she can take them out to the trash herself. Not essentially agree to her ask and then ignore and deceive her. It's the principle not the actual thing that happened.", "friend probably didnt realize OP would steal her garbage.   I'm sure she will be more careful now.  YTA OP", "She hadn\u2019t thrown them out yet. She was relying on OP to throw them out. OP agreed then decided fuck that.\n\nIf you want to consider her the asshole as well for being wasteful, be my guest. That still doesn\u2019t change the fact that OP lied to her. There\u2019s no getting around that.\n\nWhilst you can judge people for refusing to donate, you can\u2019t force them to donate and certainly cannot deceive people to get them to donate. I\u2019m concerned for anyone thinking this is an okay thing to do. \n\nSome decisions are not yours to make regardless of how correct you think you are. Anyone who thinks being correct gives them the right to make these decisions for others is an asshole.", "I think I made it clear that it's not the action, it's the deceit. \n\nI already provided a solution that can more than likely allow the clothes be donated without lying.", "I think I made it clear that it is wasteful and sometimes you have to go against wishes of others which doesn\u2019t make you TA. Her friend may think so but she is wrong in thinking so too. You really think it\u2019s \u2018deep\u2019 to be weirdly possessive and wasteful because you grew up spoiled and expect those around you to comply?", "yes it is wasteful. In some cases, it is more ethical to go against the wishes of others, and that doesn't mean you have to lie about it especially when the clothes belonged to her. If you're not going to follow her wishes, the least you can do is to be truthful to her. \n\nI am not her friend, therefore I will not assume things. I don't know the backstory, I am not her brain. Therefore, I will not pretend like I know or not if it's deep to her. And whether or not these feelings of \"deep\" is right or wrong, I even more so have no right of judging until I talk to her about it, but either way, as long as it presumably exists, it's valid in existence.", "Not sure why you keep trying to stick by the friend. I think we could have come to an agreement on ESH but for whatever reason you seem to think the friend would be able to justify why she\u2019d rather have them in the dump than have other people wearing her clothes. It\u2019s laughable to think she had a valid reason for this. \n\nIf we really want to get technical, it wasn\u2019t a lie at all. Once something is trash then it\u2019s up for grabs so all OP was doing was legally claiming trash. I highly doubt that her friend specified that it need to physically be put in a landfill and left there forever. Now that OP has said trash in their possession, they are free to donate it. If her friend saw some random rocking her clothes because they dug them out of the trash, would OP be TA there too? Friend is unreasonable and OP was smart to ignore. Should have taken the \u2018trash\u2019 out herself."]}
