Most times, our cans weren\u2019t picked up or the bags next to the cans would be ripped apart and then our landlord would get mad at us for making the area in front of our apartment \u201cmessy\u201d. \n\nWe moved out of our junior year apartment in June. In cleaning out my room, I had gathered a few bags of clothing that I wanted to donate and I put them in the hall outside my room. Roommate asked what I was doing and I let her know. She nodded and walked away. A day or two later, bags of clothes were outside of her room.\n\nWhen my mom was coming to pick me up, I took the bags of clothes to donate to my car. My roommate asked if I could take her bags of clothes to throw out. She was flying home and couldn\u2019t take them herself. I asked her if she meant donate. She shook her head no, saying that these clothes \u201cwere personal\u201d to her and she didn\u2019t want to know other people were wearing them. I rolled my eyes but said sure.\n\nWhen I got home, my little sister (16F) asked to go through the clothes before they were donated. I said yes. That afternoon, I took all of the bags of clothes to be donated \u2014 including my roommates. I figured she\u2019d never know, and what she didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt her. \n\nAnyways, flash forward to now. She comes to visit. My sister is wearing her shirt. Roommate recognizes it but says \u201cOh, I used to have it\u201d. Sister spills the beans that it was from the bags of clothes. Now my roommate isn\u2019t talking to me because she said her clothes were special to her and she wanted them thrown out. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that deep, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to throw out perfectly good clothes. \nAITA for donating clothes instead of throwing them out?", "created_utc": 1689947509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155onlp/aita_for_donating_my_roommates_clothes/", "score": 754, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You set yourself up for this. \n\nYour friend is ridiculous and wasteful. I think the best thing you could have done was donate it somewhere and then lied.

I\u2019m just gonna gloss over the fact that her request was weird as heck, but I don\u2019t really think you did anything wrong honestly. \n\nShe can\u2019t still own them when she\u2019s given them to the landfill.

You didn\u2019t behave in a trustworthy manner.", "INFO\n\nWhy didn't she want the clothes donating?\n\nThrowing them away seems wasteful especially if they were good quality.", "NTA it was wrong to let her think you did as she wanted. however seeing that she had no issues with others borrowing and nothing was sentimental she\u2019s kinda TA for demanding perfectly good clothes be thrown in the trash.  that mindset of because she didn\u2019t want the things anymore no one could have them is off putting and comes across as spoiled", "Nta", "You lied and your roommate is just ridiculous,  being possessive of clothes she was literally sending to the landfill and that she left for you to deal with. \n\nI should say  E S H but her preference for binning the clothes rather than risk her precious garments being in someone else's closet is too irritating for me. NTA", "ESH. She sucks for not being willing to donate the clothes, but the fact is you lied directly to her face and it is reasonable for her to be angry at you for that.

You did lie to her.", "NTA", "YTA here, not a big one though.\n\nIt all seemed pretty innocuous until you told her you would throw them out and then didn't. \n\nIt might be something small to lie about but it doesn't seem like there was really much reason for it? I personally wouldn't be as upset as she seems to be about the situation but I assume she's mostly upset at the break of trust rather than the specific scenario in question.", "Those clothes were not yours to dispose of as you wished, she said she wanted them thrown out instead of donating and by taking them you agreed to do as she asked - and then didn't. You wouldn't even know if they were suitable for donating without letting your sister open the bags to rummage through first. It's not about donating vs. throwing away, it's about the fact you essentially agreed one thing (even when you checked she said throw them out, and you still took them, so any reasonable person would take from that that you agreed to do her the favour she asked and throw them out for her) and did another thing directly contrary to her wishes.", "YTA. You\u2019re old enough to know better. This is negligence, plain and simple. In these situations, you ALWAYS cover your ass. Be more discreet. Warn your sister that your roommate is crazy. Lie. Say the bags got mixed up and apologize profusely for being a silly billy. Don\u2019t be an AH to yourself. Now you have an unnecessary headache. Shame on you.\n\nEdit- Like another commenter said, the anger probably is probably more due to a breach of trust, rather than the donation itself. As someone who used to have a similar roommate, be more discreet or just refuse if it\u2019s against your principles. It\u2019s not worth the drama, even if it is a ton of clothes. \u2639\ufe0f", "YTA- You know what her wishes were. You lied that you would do what was requested (throw them out) because \"what she wont know what hurt\"", "\nShe explicitly said she doesn\u2019t want her clothes donated. You decided you don\u2019t give a shit and donated them anyway and figured she\u2019d never find out. Like how are you not the asshole? \n\nIf you had such an issue with those clothes being thrown out, then don\u2019t just roll your eyes and say sure to your roommate. Talk to her about it, argue with her if needed. But remember that its still her clothes and she has the right to decide how her own things get disposed off.\n\nInstead you just made yourself into a liar. You showed her that you were willing to ignore her wishes and lie to her face if you thought you knew better.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t talk to you either if I was your friend. Quite frankly, I wouldn\u2019t trust someone who\u2019d do something like this. Sure its just clothes, but if someone was willing to lie to me over some dumb clothes, its kind of hard to continue trust that person on anything else knowing that they\u2019re perfectly willing to lie to me and disregard my wishes to get their way.", "YTA, she is also being unreasonably possessive over her own clothing and it probably has to do with the fact that she's an only child never had to share her entire life, but either way, her clothes, her choice.\n\nYou specifically asked her if she wants to donate her clothes.\n\nShe made it clear as day no.\n\nYou literally just had to add after her saying no \"I'm not going to throw perfectly good clothes out, if you are letting me deal with these clothes, I will be donating them.\"\n\nand then it'll be perfectly fine with your actions.\n\nInstead, you said \"sure\" while your actions choosing to ignore her clear as day instructions as to what to do with her clothes without communicating with her, and quite frankly, it's going to create trust issues.\n\nedit: just because something is not deep to you, doesn't mean it's also not a big deal to someone else.

In some cases, it is more ethical to go against the wishes of others, and that doesn't mean you have to lie about it especially when the clothes belonged to her. If you're not going to follow her wishes, the least you can do is to be truthful to her. \n\nI am not her friend, therefore I will not assume things. I don't know the backstory, I am not her brain.

I think we could have come to an agreement on ESH but for whatever reason you seem to think the friend would be able to justify why she\u2019d rather have them in the dump than have other people wearing her clothes. It\u2019s laughable to think she had a valid reason for this. \n\nIf we really want to get technical, it wasn\u2019t a lie at all. Once something is trash then it\u2019s up for grabs so all OP was doing was legally claiming trash. I highly doubt that her friend specified that it need to physically be put in a landfill and left there forever. Now that OP has said trash in their possession, they are free to donate it. If her friend saw some random rocking her clothes because they dug them out of the trash, would OP be TA there too? Friend is unreasonable and OP was smart to ignore.

It's an object that you're willing to throw out, why should you care what happens to it later at all?
