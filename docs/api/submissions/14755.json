He insulted you and she said nothing. You're the only one who isn't TA.", "NTA. This would have not started if your gf's brother world have not mocked you for your refrainment from driving. The guy literally went straight out and insulted your 'manhood'. He brought a knife, you retaliated with a shotgun. If he can't take it, he shouldn't have dished it out.", "NTA but don't stick around.", "I say NTA, he insulted you, and you matched. He couldn't take it, fuck him and that family.", "NTA - hahahaha this is a text book FAAFO scenario. No notes, 10/10 response. You brought a nuke to a knife fight, and maybe bro will think twice about insulting other people\u2019s manhood again.", "NTA\nYou need to stand up for yourself when you are bullied. And you your girlfriend cannot understand this, that's too bad for her. You're better off without her in this situation.", "NTA. Dump the girl, she sounds like someone you don\u2019t want to be associated with.", "Nice work. Bullying behaviour needs standing up to. Although quietly leaving might have been the diplomatic route, I still think NTA. You were being mocked as a guest. That's not on and your GF should've managed the situation to avoid you needing to.", "NTA\n\nI don't get how it's possible what we read so many similar stories here. Provided that OP didn't hide any details, why are so many disrespectful to others yet take it so badly when they receive a reaction?\n\nOP, your answer after someone laughed at you due to a medical condition is absolutely normal. If your girlfriend can't understand your reaction, I'm sorry but I'm not sure if there's a solution. I hope you two sort it out", "NTA if you dish it. You gotta be able to take it", "Probably time to say goodbye to this relationship.

Looking down on people like that makes you TA too", "ESH\n\nnot convinced you didn\u2019t say awful stuff to brother first considering the meltdown you had.  Could have just said nm and walked home without alienating your gfs fam and kept the \u2019bigger person\u2019 status.", "ESH. (everyone sucks here)\n\nYou are lightly TA because of your comment. However the brother clearly is one because of his gender roles bullying.\n\nYour GF is siding with him by not standing up for you.\n\nHer dad is TA by not telling his son to knock off the bullying, as well as demanding an apology from you but not from his son.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
