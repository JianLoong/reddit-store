You are not in the wrong, however you did handle the situation with both the brother and your girlfriend badly. That relationship wont last", "ESH, obviously.

Genius!", "Disagreed. The brother was laughing at the guy's manhood, and when told it was because of a disability, he doubled down. That's fucking low and deserves what he was told. It was the perfect comeback if the father lost it, he was probably feeling insecure about it and OP caught on to that.", "Agree 100%", "You sound like those posters in schools saying you're as bad as your bully if you defend yourself with an implied \"rather than taking it quietly\"", "How was I supposed to act in your opinion?", "Normally I am one of the take higher ground folks but OP was a guest in this house. Her brother is allowed to be rude to him, about his disability no less, and he is supposed to bite his tongue?

He handled this way better than many would have, he said what he had to say, and damn OP it was so wittily said! and left. \n\nNTA", "Hard disagree, here. Mildly obnoxious would've just been something about being that age and not driving, maybe. This brother was clearly acting out in a hard, toxic, \"masculine\" way because OP was dating his sibling. There is intended malice behind this which I find insane for, as far as I can tell, the first time the brother met OP.\n\nDid OP come back hard? Maybe. Was it even necessary as opposed to just walking out? Maybe not. However, OP explained the reason for not driving, and it's a damned good one, but the brother kept on and nobody else stepped up. So, with that, should the girlfriend have stepped in against her brother? Yes! Should the parents have stepped in solely on the basis that OP is their guest (not to mention the bf of their daughter)? Hell yes!\n\nDo two wrongs make a right? No. Does.the bully deserve to be stood up to? Yes! Especially when the bully's family is perfectly okay with that happening.", "Think of it this way, you don't have to deal with the awful family for the rest of your life now.

In my language it sounds *perfect*.\n\nNTA!", "NTA. Be glad. You didn't even say anything that harsh. And if her brother bought his degree he's the one who exhibited class privilege.", "It may not feel like it, and of course no one here knows the relationship like you, but i think you dodged a bullet, even if it may not feel like it atm NTA", "You mean fortunately. Why would you want to be with someone who lets their family insult you? You can do much better than that.\n\nNTA and let's hope she never dates someone who's blind, has seizures, or an environmentalist.", "Honestly it sounds like this would not be the last time this happened..  So you are probably better off.  Is it worth being harassed potentially every time you visit her family.", "Yeah cause badly making fun of someone\u2019s medical condition is roasting them. Also, he knows all of the words in his language and some in yours, so you\u2019re in no position to insult his English", "You don't defend yourself by acting the same way", "They\u2019re probably going to say something stupid like \u201cYou should have walked away with your head high\u201d.", "If your \"what should i have done\" question was not just a rhetorical rejection, i was advocating for (1) thinking about where someone else might be coming from (insecurity that his sister is seeing a guy with more education), (2) better educated people really really have no business making fun of the different speech patterns of less educated (do you admire white college graduates who make fun of black dialect?), (3) kindness rarely is the worst response to an insult that does you no harm, and (4) from a purely selfish interest, trading insults with her brother is hardly likely to improve your relationship with this girl. Learning how to deflect a mild jeer and de-escalate might actually be a life skill of future value. \n\nI see that my opinion has been severely downvoted: redditors tend to applaud self-righteous verbal one-upsmanship, so i should not be surprised.", "Of course the brother was inhospitable and rude. I acknowledge that you share the majority opinion. I just think belittling a less educated person for their less educated speech pattern is not something to be proud of.", "And the awful girlfriend. Her family being sacred means her brother can make fun of OP all he wants even though OP had a reasonable explanation?", "Its perfectly justified to do so, being a doormat and letting bullies walk over you isn't a virtue.", "Like somebody else posted: it says a lot about you how you act when you're angry. \nI am not saying you can't defend yourself or get up and leave for being disrespected.\nBut being classiest, racist, sexist.. whatever is not ok just because the other person is TA themselves", "I disagree. If they don't get treated the same way they treat others, they will never learn", "Well I disagree with you on that.\nTwo wrongs don't make a right"]}
