My MIL is more of a piece of work than I thought.\n\na couple days after I posted that, I showed my wife the comments, warts and all. to her credit, she was \"apologetic\", in that she knew her mom was in the wrong but had gotten so used to the behavior that she was hesitant to correct it.\n\nI said that we probably needed to rip the band-aid off if her mom was going to come back next year, and she agreed, very reluctantly.\n\nI should note something about my wife's family: they don't really \"argue\" in the way that you or I understand it. They complain to each others' faces, loudly, and then no one changes their mind, and then it's buried until it flares up again. \n\n(This is something my wife and I have worked through very thoroughly over the course of many years, and it is probably why MIL's marriage recently fell apart.)\n\nanyway, so we get on a call with her and bring up her grievance, with me as a silent speakerphone partner. and she is still *apoplectic* about it, for reasons that I frankly do not understand at the time. She starts talking herself in wild circles about what she perceives happened (which was not particularly accurate, but I don't much care, I just want harmony next time she visits) and finally my wife says something to the effect of \"mom, what are you actually upset about?\"\n\nAnd finally we get to the actual crux.\n\n>I'm really just disappointed that my son in law would speak to me like that.\n\n>>Mom, he had asked you to leave the kitchen several times and you wouldn't.\n\n>**I'm seventy years old and I know my way around the kitchen, and some respect for it would be nice.**\n\nso that's what it was. You were all right: it was a stupid fucking power play about her being a guest instead of in charge.\n\nto my wife's eternal credit, she used the phrasing I recommended: \"mom, next time you're here, **you need to respect the boundaries we set.**\" MIL says \"fine\" and hangs up and ignores my wife for three weeks, but was all sunshine the next time they talked. \n\nNow I know that I will need to meticulously set those boundaries with my words, and then enforce those boundaries if she breaks them. But honestly, I don't know what I expect going forward. it's at least nice to know what the actual problem was. Thanks to all who helped me see what was really going on.", "created_utc": 1682545961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1300uqc/update_aita_for_confirming_my_mils_suspicion_that/", "score": 2353, "replies": ["#[Link to the original post in case you missed it](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112fowi/aita_for_confirming_my_mils_suspicion_that_i/)"]}
