Of course I may be reading too much into it and MIL might just be stupid and not misogynistic. Twins are not two of the same person, but maybe she never bothered getting to know any of the twins in her family.\n\nPerhaps you should assume the best and take MIL out for a fun evening of whatever food and activity she absolutely detests because someone else would enjoy it so she needs to learn to enjoy it too.", "NTA...\n\nShe wants them to 'act the same' bc they are twins? Wtf? They aren't toys?", "NTA once the gift is given, the receiver can do whatever they please with it.", "NTA but your husband is for turning this into an issue for his family.

The purpose of the gift is to make the recipient happy, and in that spirit, switching was the right thing, and a mature adult would understand that. The fact they are saying you are the AH for making the kids happy show they had nefarious (and frankly ridiculous) motives.

Your mother-in-law is manipulative and your husband needs to grow a spine and stand up for his wife and children!", "NTA. your mother-in-law has some very strange reasoning, and your husband is a bit protective. i don't know why this is, and i'm not willing to say that it makes her a bad person, or that it was even a bad thing to do. trying to restrict you from switching is, though. swap them and tell her that she can't make your children change, and tell your husband that he should put his children before his mother.", "NTA.

Twins need a some individuality! To often we are just talked about as twins, but not who we are or what we like individually!", "NTA\nEven the closest twins are still individuals. It's unhealthy to want them to \"be the same.\"\n\n Plus. It's up to them what they do with their own property, regardless of if it's a gift or not. Kudos for supporting them wanting to switch. and double kudos to your kids for being polite in front of guests.", "You're NTA. Gifts are meant to be enjoyed be the recipient. Your MIL deliberately ignored your children's interests for no good reason.", "NTA for letting the kids swap presents but ESH for how everything else was handled. There was no reason to bring it up around her, unless she had directly asked. Even if it wasn\u2019t at a volume you thought others could hear you, it just didn\u2019t need to be said right then. That being said she also shouldn\u2019t be trying to force your kids into having the same interests", "NTA trying to force twins, or any siblings, to be the \"same\" is how you make both kids feel like they're not individuals and only live in each others shadows.\n\nIf she wanted to help them enjoy each others hobbies, she could have asked Matt to draw his sister a monster truck or something, or asked Matila to \"bring\" Matt his art supplies in her trucks, THAT'S engaging them in each others activities without being manipulative jerks about it.", "NTA. Next year swap at home or let them do it in front of MIL. Kids like what they like. Make sure to send pictures of Matilda playing cars and Mat drawing.

I hate when husbands side with their mothers no matter what.", "NTA I have boy and girl twins and they couldn\u2019t be more different. Mine are toddlers but the personality and interest differences are so obvious. This is sketchy af.", "NTA your husband lowkey sucks for letting that slide.", "YTA for making drama out of something as trivial as children trading toys.

But I have also met sexists that weren't homophobic.)\n\nBut yeah, I wondered the same thing. wonder if that makes us the asshole for assuming sexism? lol", "She didn\u2019t go down and shout it to everyone, plus grandma should hear it since she done it deliberately with no regards to what the kids wanted. They\u2019re twins, if they\u2019re forced to grow up having to be exactly like one another that\u2019s just going to cause resentment to whoever\u2019s trying to force them. GM sounds horrible", "I admit I'm just assuming the homophobia here as I see a whole lot of overlap when it comes to attempts to enforce \"traditional\" gender roles.    Dig deep enough and it almost always gets to  \"I want my son to be a real man and not turn out gay.\"  But fair point, that's not a certainty.\n\nAs for the later question, I think we're just going by the odds.   Families wanting opposite sex fraternal twins to act alike is not a common thing--truthfully, I've never heard of it (identical twins, sometimes you do see that kind of weirdness.)    Families trying to push their kids into \"acceptable\" gender roles is extremely common.", "I'm calling BS on the grandma 'wanting them to be the same'. She wants them to conform to gender norms. Good on OP for not acceding to this.

You need to have a fight with your husband about him not doing right by you and the kids, an actively putting your kids into situations where they're supposed to make his mother feel good at their direct expense.", "NTA.

The \u201cexplanation\u201d was an excuse.", "I mean because it is a family issue, he overtly told the poster that he let his mother do this to their kids. The issue here is that he is not on his kids side, he's on his mom's side. He's chosen a team, and it's the wrong one because he's a parent and a partner, not her son first", "Unfortunately it sounds like he has a spine, he's just chosen his mother over his partner and his kids and is willing to fight them and tell them that they need to give his mother what she wants", "I mean I'm not sure that explanation is actually less damning than sexism. Like sexism sucks but it's at least semi normalized in most cultures whereas the reason she gave makes her sound like a crazy person.", "Yep. Color me surprised \ud83d\ude44", "I mean she should look bad no matter what the reasoning is, she went out of her way to give her grandkids gifts they didn't like because she wants them to be the characters that she wants. She's not treating your kids like they are people and it's both of y'all's job as their parents to make sure they are treated right.", "I have also met some very sexist gays and lesbians.\n\nI think the word we are all looking for is bigot.", "Yeah, they\u2019re both pretty sick.
