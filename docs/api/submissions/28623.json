She wanted to spend time with you and her sisters in law, opening her heart to you, and you completely shut her down.

Personally if I'm ever fortunate enough to have any children, I'm very grateful my own mother was a narcissist and I don't seem to have the blood attachment you do. If I ever have kids, they won't be biological and I will still love them all equally.\n\nReally, the difference itself has to do with how you choose to treat them and the time you've known them. Far less to do with biology than you might think.\n\nPut it this way, if you've known a friend your entire life and hang out with them more than your entire family, who are you going to be more attached to?\n\nBlood is what we make it.

Hear me out.  \n\nFrom your replies to comments, even a blind person could see how much you dislike your DIL.  You vehemently dislike her and your disdain just drips off every word.  I'm sure she knows you don't like her.  It's sad.  I was the DIL my in laws didn't like, and I can empathize with what your DIL is feeling.\n\nAre you required to involve her in your little family traditions?  No.  Not in the slightest.  And you're not TA for not inviting her.  You want this to be some special bonding time with your adult daughters because you were (and let's admit it, are) probably an emotionally unavailable dad.  You don't seem to be in contact with feeling like empathy, kindness, generosity, or basic decency because otherwise you would have either offered an invitation to her or you would have been kinder in how you put up your boundary.\n\nPutting up a boundary like not wanting her to come because you just want your biological family there is reasonable and understandable.  Saying what you did, and how you said it was unnecessarily cruel.  I'd bet my 11th toe you were cruel on purpose so she never has the audacity to think she's welcome in your family ever again let alone in the first place.  \n\nAnd buddy, who counts how many hours they've spent with in laws or \"found family\" (whatever tf that is)?  75 hours?  My god man, I have cousins who I know I haven't spent that much time around and I still love them dearly and treat them with kindness.  It's not that hard.  It's 2023.

Gifts at birthdays and holidays, favors, planning events - you should get NOTHING from this woman ever again. From the sounds of it you probably can\u2019t expect much from your son either.

When the daughter in law and your son drift away and don't bring kids by or spend as much time with your family, just remember that you made sure to set a line in the sand that she is an other and not your daughter. They will end up mirroring the line in the sand you drew, and eventually they won't feel the urge to cross it at all. I've seen this happen a couple of times in my cousins and best friends families where the dads had similar traditions. Now grandpa sees his grandkids and one of his sons maybe once a year, and daughter in law doesn't show up at all. Why spend time on family who doesn't see you as family?", "YTA.

This is something that I can understand being exclusive when kids are children, but not when they're married adults. Families grow.

The way we see it, if we exclude our newest family member, that sends a message that she's expendable and can be gotten rid of or treated like crap because she's \"not really family\". My mother, aunt, and another aunt (by marriage to my mom's brother) just called each other sisters. They were very close and never missed a girls day together. The concept of in-laws just doesn't really cross our minds in our family. We call them bonus family instead.\n\nIdk, it could just be my family.

This wasn\u2019t an intentional exclusion to a new thing. Pushing was her own fault.

Grandma, her daughters, her daughters' in law, their daughters, and their daughters' in law.  I went this year (I'm a daughter in law of a daughter in law) and it just felt so wonderful to be included in with his family.

You aren't an actual daughter to your in laws, and never will be. \n\nThe DIL here is the one that overstepped boundaries and then argued.

It is pretty ridiculous to think you're invited to a personal family tradition that has nothing to do w/ you, it's not a family bday or vacation or any event that would involve everyone. Her husband also has his mother-son time so she could've been invited to that if she wanted. I feel like ppl are allowed to have separate family outings that don't involve everyone esp when those outings are traditions from before someone came into the family and I don't think this means they hate the person or don't consider them family.
