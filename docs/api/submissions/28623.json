No. Would it be a nice gesture? Yes (if your daughters agreed). Could you maybe have handled the situation better?

Yes. Do things that foment inclusion. Doing things with just your daughters is fine. But you now also need to find other separate ways to include your dil. She may not be your daughter, but she is part of your family.", "NTA and reason is because if i was her I wouldn't have asked. If I was wanted somewhere I'd get an invite.

Those dates were set up so you could spend time with your kids, not her. There is no reason that she would be going.

Would it absolutely crush you? Does she have a good relationship with her own father? Maybe she is missing some of that care in her life. I'm not saying YTA but am saying that there is an opportunity to maybe just make your DIL smile.", "NTA.  As this has been a tradition YEARS in the making, it isn't like you just have a daughters' lunch and deliberately didn't include her, definitely NTA.  I understand how she could be confused, she just wanted to be a part of things.  Maybe talk to your daughters and see if they want to expand this to in laws in the future.

I will say, however, that I had the greatest MIL in the world and one of the reasons is that she immediately included me and her other DIL in most of the girls events that she did with her daughter, like lunches and shopping trips. (Not every time, they also had some mother daughter events alone). Because she accepted me so completely in the family, even though she has now passed, my SIL and I are still incredibly close, actually closer than I am to my bio sister. Our children are as close as siblings and the entire extended family gets along beautifully with no drama.", "I feel sorry for Sue.  You say she is a nice girl and it sounds like for some reason she thought she was included in this event as part of the family, (group post?  invite or info from her husband?).  IDK how you actually handled the conversation but you make it sound as if you were quite blunt whereas perhaps you could have handled the situation better.  I imagine she feels rejected, embarrassed, and family relationships will suffer because of what appears to be a lack of tact on your part.  If this is the case, YTA.", "Nta. Certainly could have been handled much more tactfully, but nta for her not being invited. Just the asshole for how you told her.", "NTA.

It a cultural thing. In my family all daughters in law are like daughters.

Jesus christ.", "You're certainly going to create some issues for her in the future...\n\nWe are our own trauma and it sounds like you're deliberately causing her trauma.\n\nWhy do you choose to treat your DIL differently than your own blood? Sure, you've known your biological child longer, but why are you okay mistreating someone else simply because they aren't blood? They are still your family.", "lol NTA\n\nThis is a tradition with your daughters, not anyone else. \n\nShe is mighty entitled to invite herself like that.", "NTA\n\nshe and your eldest are obviously hard of understanding!\n\nThis is a simple premiss, you have a tea date with your daughters. I am not sure what either of them are missing in that. She is not your daughter.\n\nDoes your wife still have Mum Son dates? Perhaps she could explain it to your eldest!", "NTA\n\nI get that she wants to be a part of the family tradition, but this is something special you do with just your daughters.  Perhaps take your son and DIL out for a nice dinner for time to time, but she can't invite herself to this.  That's not how it works.", "NTA. It's really lovely that you still do this. Other people can't invite themselves, no matter how much fun it sounds.", "YTA.  100%.", "I would go with ESH here. \n\nDIL is the AH for coming in between him and his daughters when he clearly doesn't want her to.\n\nHe is the AH by the way he replied. He could have politely said no and not \"she isn't my kid\".\n\nSon is the AH too by expecting his wife to be in the same place as his sisters. It's just not possible.", "NTA. She\u2019s rather entitled to assume she would be invited. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you wanting time with just your own kids. She doesn\u2019t need to be involved", "Soft Esh. She was presumptuous as hell and you could have been more considerate.", "ESH. She should have had your son ask you instead to gauge your reaction, and not let this blow over this way. It's obviously a very important time you've established with your daughters, and having an outsider come in is off-putting and out of line for you, which is okay.\n\nThe reason I say ESH is because she was coming from a vulnerable place and wanted to fit in the family dynamic somehow. She wanted to spend time with you and her sisters in law, opening her heart to you, and you completely shut her down. Perhaps explaining to her tea time is a sacred time with your daughters only, but that you all could do a different activity would have been a better way to handle it.", "NTA - relationships are built, not demanded.", "NTA. Ask your son how she even heard that it was happening and why she would think she was invited.", "If one of your actual daughters assumed the DiL was invited then this isn't the SUPER SPECIAL EXCLUSIVE BLOOD RELATIVE ONLY thing you assumed.  \n\n\nThe hardest thing about having kids grow and move on to new phases of life is that the relationship shifts. What was tradition when they were in the house might be a bit different when they've moved out and different again when they marry and start their own families. Adding a daughter in-law is another evolution.   \n\n\nI'll add that anytime you say insist that someone isn't \"really\" part of your family because they are by marriage that YTA. She knows what the relationship is; she thought it meant more to you than it does.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to feel more like a part of the family, forcing herself into plans that are a tradition for your kids is not a good way to do it.", "INFO: are these dates more for you or for your daughters? It sounds like the oldest invited your DIL, probably as a gesture of good will and an opportunity to make her feel like part of the family. If your daughters wanted her there then you come off as at best a bit dense, and at worse needlessly cruel and uncompromising.", "NTA\n\nIt's a daughter-father thing.\n\nYou son should have stopped his wife himself.\n\n>I told her this is just a thing between me and my daughters. She repeated that she is my daughter in law\n\nWhy did she insist?

It does seem kind of weird. \n\nI probably would have asked the daughters before rejecting but making it clear that you wouldn\u2019t tell her you talked to them. \n\nIts very family specific. My Mom does stuff with my sisters (we are all adults if that matters) and she does invite mine and my brother\u2019s wives. However, we don\u2019t live close so its not all the time.

He isn\u2019t the asshole here - the bare minimum obligation is surely to welcome the daughter in law to family events? Not to long standing traditions that he has to bond with his kids - maybe in time the daughter in law will be involved but that feels like it has to happen organically not just I am your daughter in law ergo I am invited.", "Yikes. Personally if I'm ever fortunate enough to have any children, I'm very grateful my own mother was a narcissist and I don't seem to have the blood attachment you do. If I ever have kids, they won't be biological and I will still love them all equally.\n\nReally, the difference itself has to do with how you choose to treat them and the time you've known them. Far less to do with biology than you might think.\n\nPut it this way, if you've known a friend your entire life and hang out with them more than your entire family, who are you going to be more attached to?\n\nBlood is what we make it. So, I'll ask again, why are you okay treating your wife's kids differently?", "Crying doesn\u2019t make a person right.

It's slightly ambiguously written.  \n\n\nIn any event, once she knows about it (and from other comments seems to have heard about in in a GC) then it would, again, be a kindness to include her. There's no actual harm in doing so.", "you told her several times before she got the message. Her crying is not down to you", "It was mentioned in the kids groups chat because the youngest was asking her sibling which tea place sounds better. Also it has never been a problem before.
