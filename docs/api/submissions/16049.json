Giving birth is is a difficult and personal process. For the health of the baby and yourself you need to focus on the delivery and keep stress levels down. Having someone hanging around that you're not comfortable with can lead to pregnancy complications and poor delivery outcomes. These statements have been proven by research.

What matters during your delivery is having support, and his presence isn't going to do anything for you in that regard. While you're in a vulnerable state besides. Maybe you're willing to let him be in the waiting room to see the baby afterwards, but that's your choice. It's your body going through this experience, and your physical and mental wellbeing are more important than his ego. I hope you have a family member or close friend to be with you? Not only can they support you during the delivery, but they can have your back and help enforce boundaries afterwards.\n\nHe gave up his opportunity to be in a position of support for you when he decided to end the marriage.

He can come over and take over baby duty so you can shower, rest, eat, etc. He can keep the oldest kiddo out of your hair while you're trying to do baby care. Anything other than offers to legitimately help are only motivated by selfishness. And having a little breathing room to get settled first is not too much to ask. \n\nYou are not in the wrong.
