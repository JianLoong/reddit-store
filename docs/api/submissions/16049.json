The person carrying and giving birth to the baby has all the say in the world about who can be around and for what parts and as primary caretaker, you\u2019re well within your rights to maintain a safe and stress-free place for yourself and your kids. Him wanting to stay with you while also wanting a divorce and seeing other people is emotionally dull and entitled.", "Nta- but he definitely is. If his behavior wouldn't affect his ability to contribute financially, I would tell his commanding officer that he's having an affair. You are literally pregnant with his 2nd child & he pulls some shyt like this? You deserve better, clean his pockets out, and go nuclear in divorce court. Request half of his pension along with enough child support & maintenance for you  to have a significant level of comfort.  Hell- I would even use his affair as leverage   to get everything you desire to his discomfort.  Actions have consequences & you hold all the cards. Fck that guy.", "NTA. Don\u2019t feel guilty about putting your needs first as you get over a very hard breakup while preparing for having a baby. He messed this up for himself and now has to deal with the consequences.", "\u2018NTA -Don\u2019t stop his access to the first child while you are still pregnant, but he lost the right to stay in your home. \n\nHe has no rights to be in delivery. This moment is not about him, this isn\u2019t even about the baby. The baby won\u2019t come out and instantly say \u201cwhere\u2019s my dad?\u201d  This moment is yours and yours alone. You have the right to only have people around you who support you. You don\u2019t need a person who hurt you anywhere near you when you are at your most vulnerable.", "NTA. Giving birth is is a difficult and personal process. For the health of the baby and yourself you need to focus on the delivery and keep stress levels down. Having someone hanging around that you're not comfortable with can lead to pregnancy complications and poor delivery outcomes. These statements have been proven by research. Be honest and totally blunt with him. If he wants to not be a deadbeat dad and do what's best for his kid, he needs to stay away until you've delivered and had some time to recover.", "There are lots of ways for him to not be a dead beat dad that don't include imposing on you during and after a major medical event. What matters during your delivery is having support, and his presence isn't going to do anything for you in that regard. While you're in a vulnerable state besides. Maybe you're willing to let him be in the waiting room to see the baby afterwards, but that's your choice. It's your body going through this experience, and your physical and mental wellbeing are more important than his ego. I hope you have a family member or close friend to be with you? Not only can they support you during the delivery, but they can have your back and help enforce boundaries afterwards.\n\nHe gave up his opportunity to be in a position of support for you when he decided to end the marriage. This was *his* choice. And if he doesn't look at it as anything besides that, and more like his \"right\" because he's the father, his motivations are out of line. \n\nYou know how he can be present? He can come over and take over baby duty so you can shower, rest, eat, etc. He can keep the oldest kiddo out of your hair while you're trying to do baby care. Anything other than offers to legitimately help are only motivated by selfishness. And having a little breathing room to get settled first is not too much to ask. \n\nYou are not in the wrong. Putting aside your feelings for the kids doesn't mean you don't get to have reasonable boundaries. Stand your ground, mama. NTA.", "NTA. He\u2019s still thinking about what is best for him.  He doesn\u2019t get it both ways, to dump you but also expect to live in the family home and be the birthing partner.  It sounds like he\u2019s cheating emotionally at least.  Don\u2019t make yourself be around him, it\u2019s too hard.  Rip off the bandaid.\n\nPS: your career as it is impressive even if you don\u2019t go further.  He\u2019s being a jackass to imply going to OCS makes him somehow more accomplished and driven than you.  He\u2019s drinking the military koolaid they are feeding them at OCS about how they are better and brighter and saving the world.  This dummy is going to graduate, look around and realize he lost his family for a rahrah speech that he and his new crush fell for.", "NTA. I don't think this is an unfair boundary to set. You're not preventing him from seeing your shared children, just ensuring you have an emotionally safe environment to recover from giving birth.", "NTA!  If you don\u2019t have close family near you, get your besty to be there, and other of your girls to stand guard near the delivery room.  His ideas about imposing on an emotionally & physically vulnerable person, when HE is responsible for said vulnerability?  Well he can stick them right up his clacker!!!", "You may want to research the 10/10 rule.  If you\u2019ve been married to a service member for 10 years, there are additional benefits for you.  Sorry I don\u2019t have all the details, but it\u2019s worth you looking into before moving ahead with a divorce.", "NTA.\n\nBut you need legal advice before you handle this. Assuming that you are co-owners of the house and depending on the laws where you are, you may not be able to stop him being in the house. I am not saying this to tell you you\u2019re morally wrong, but to prevent you from running in to any issues.", "No. Don'tet him back in. He probably cheated while you were pregnant and feels guilty about it. Let him drown in his guilt.\n\nThink of you. Take care of YOU. If you're too stressed and miserable over your situation with him, you won't be able to mentally be there for your kids. Your kids are important, you need to be there for them. He needs to find his own way to be there for them, but this should not be at your expense!\n\nNtA! \n\nI hope everything works out for you!", "NTA\n\nThe pregnant person gets to decide who they want supporting them in the labor & post-partum period", "NTA  \nUnless in severe economic circumstances initiating divorce means separation.  Separation means he doesn't get to stay in the house with you all.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m going to give it to you straight as an ex-defence employee. He was cheating on you.\n\nThe amount of boys who go through enlistment training, cheat on their partners and then dump said partners AFTER training (have to keep them around to send care packages and pay the bills after all ) is ridiculous. \n\nBirth is a vulnerable time, so no he doesn\u2019t get to be there if that makes you uncomfortable. Send his ass to a hotel.", "Did he get the house in the divorce? If so, I think it'd be pretty difficult to legally keep him out. If not, he doesn't have the right to just stay there when he wants.\n\nNTA for feeling that way though. Stress can be pretty unhealthy for an unborn baby.", "NTA. You don't get to have your cake and eat it too.", "NTA I hope you have other people around you, who care for your daughter while/after birth giving and for you. Everything you should think about is yourself and your children. He made his choice, now he has to deal with the consequences.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU get to set the guest list at your birthgiving. ANd YOU Get to decide who visits you after giving birth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \"Am I wrong for telling him to get a hotel instead of coming back to the house to see his daughter and soon to be son?\" .. But yopu really should get the divorce FAST, and go for court setting the custody agreement and child support payments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: When he has moved out, DO NOT LET HIM move back in even for a day. THat will weaken your position art court. What if he decides not to move out again?", "NTA, he created this situation. You should absolutely not bad mouth him to your children; but you do not need to let him bully you into staying in the same house. He can get a hotel and make arrangements to see the kids at a neutral site. If you are in the divorce process now, please make sure to get as much visitation detail (as in not visiting them in your home)  in the agreement as possible.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
