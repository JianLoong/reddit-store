Send him a small gift or call on a holiday.  What you do now until he is 18 matters.  If he plays a sport or performs in a show, try to go to a game or show.  It matters to him while he is young.  Be there for him in a way your family did not know how to be there for you.  Doing so in the younger years makes a difference.  It sets the relationship for later if he will have fond memories of you and want to be with you.  10 year olds like adults.  Teens less so.  Show up now if you can.  Enjoy and get to know him.

I respect that you not only took advantage of your second chance but you\u2019re kicking butt still reaching higher goals. But don\u2019t expect your loved ones to fall all over themselves in the future when you have more time and focus.", "You know, college campuses have free mental health services right?\n\nI went to school as an adult and it was really hard - I was either in classes, working, or studying. But there are still holidays and breaks so there is some downtime to focus on family and come out of the school fog for a bit.\n\nYou missed ten years of your nephew's life. That's pretty effed up. I get the priority of education, but there should also be some balance.", "I hope you have a support system to rely on OP.working hard for your education is so great, but people generally allso need people. \n\nThere has to be balance in your life, and I hope you succeed and graduate but also find the time and effort to build up the other parts of your life too.", "I don't think you're an asshole because you prioritized yourself and well being", "You could tell your sister that phones go both ways", "Yta. Over educated. Get a job.", "NTA\n\nYour priorities are in the right place. What could have been a nice outing was ruined by your sister. You could have had some bonding time with your nephew then if she hadn\u2019t stormed away. \n\nThe truth is that you are a busy adult student and professional with your own life. You aren\u2019t going to be able to spend as much time with your nephew as you had in the past and that\u2019s okay - it doesn\u2019t mean that you love him, or the rest of your family any less.", "NTA, but having done my BA with three kids and a job, and my graduate degree several years later while working full time, I don't understand how you have had absolutely no time for family.  A few hours for a family dinner once a month on one of those \"admin\" days would not have severely impacted your education.  It's not that you prioritized your education, you pretty much slammed the door on family for your education.  \n\nThat doesn't make you an AH, but at least acknowledge the fact that you've ignored at least your sister and nephew for the last 8 years, even while apparently living in the same town.  You're not obligated to be involved with family, of course, but you should at least be able to understand your sister's point of view.", "NTA", "NTA but you might want to reframe how you think about it. You aren't choosing education over your family, you're choosing to go low-contact with your family. This is understandable. If you were as bad at 16 as you seemed, and now you're doing much better, cutting your family out a bit might have been a good idea. But like, it's more complicated than \"I'm getting my education so I don't have time for family.\"", "What a lot of people don't understand is how all consuming graduate education can be. I have two master's degree, and worked on a doctorate. I didn't know a single fellow grad student who was married at the beginning of their education who was \\*still\\* married by the end. And they weren't \\*all\\* assholes - it's just the nature of grad studies. You immerse yourself into a field of study, and exclude anything that isn't that. Doesn't mean you don't care, just that you don't have the bandwidth to deal with specialized education \\*and\\* a spouse/partner or family at the same time. I think you're NTA, but realize that other won't necessarily agree.", "NAH - I get that you\u2019re putting your education first, but I think you should also try to get to know your nephew. I didn\u2019t really know my cousins growing up because my family moved around a lot when I was a kid\u2026 your sister isn\u2019t wrong for wanting you to know your nephew and you\u2019re not wrong for wanting to further your education. \n\nMy brother is in medical school on the other side of the country from my sister & nephews, and he tries to call at least once a month at minimum to keep in touch.\n\nI live in a different country, and have for the past 4 years, and I FaceTime them when I can to get to know them.", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe your family anything.", "Mostly NTA, but what about holidays and over summer break? Are you saying that you could never spare any time at all to see family then either?  I find that a stretch.", "I am going to have to disagree and say the OP is a bit of an AH.\n\n  \nFor me the main sticking point is the 10 year old Nephew did not recognise the OP AND the sister lives in the same city (or general area).\n\n  \nI get the OP is busy and needs to focus on her education.\n\n  \nOn the other hand if 10 year old does not recognize you at all then that means you have not seen them for years.\n\n  \nKeep in mind the Sister did not make a comment about baby-sitting or going out of the OP's way to visit or stay over or vice-versa.\n\n  \nShe commented that the OP is apparently so busy that a 10 year old does not recognize her. \n\n  \nMy niece and nephew live in another country, I did not physically see them before they were 7+. They still recognized me when I did from Face-Time calls and a few birthday presents etc...\n\n  \nIs the OP that tremendously busy that a few Video-Calls is too much? \n\n  \nBy the same token how is her (lack of) relationship with the rest of her family? Does she stay in any contact at all? \n\nHonestly it sounds like OP has gone No-Contact and just never bothered to formalize things.", "NTA\n\nWhy wasn't she making any effort?  You know arrange time with you? invite you to holidays.  Do something to help you doing these years you've worked your A$$ off?\n\nShe wanted you there to babysit and make her life easier.", "NTA. You are self funded, you prioritise.", "NTA. BTW - your sister could probably easily invite you over for a meal or two. I'm sure you'd appreciate the gesture and you'd be able to build a relationship with your nephew. But, since she seems super toxic, probably best to just nod when she says stuff like that. Given your childhood, it might be best to establish clear boundaries for your own well-being. First one might be - don't spend time with people who make you feel bad when you didn't do anything wrong. Those people suck.", "I totally think my kids are the most important thing on the planet, but I'm self aware enough to realise my partner is the only one who agrees with me! \ud83d\ude02\n\n\nMore the point, in this tech age it takes almost no effort to snap a quick selfie and send a life update. My kid sees one grandparent once a year at best due to geographical inconvenience - we video chat and share photos so this could never happen! I'd say all the adults suck at communication but definitely NTA.", "Especially when want free babysitting! Which is, I suspect, what the sister is unhappy about not getting from OP.", "Unless they\u2019re thoughtful. I don\u2019t expect anyone to love my kids like I do, I do expect people to put more important things first. Hell, they can put whatever first it\u2019s not my business. They make those choices. The result is OP isn\u2019t super close to her nephew at the moment. Once her PhD is done, who knows. I know plenty of people with various non-medical PhDs and they have plenty of free time *now.* When they were getting their PhD they didn\u2019t have hardly any, and when they did they were working, studying, or doing work for their PhD. Considering the amount of money they spent to get it, I\u2019d sure as hell hope it was priority one.", "I'm gunna be completely honest, the kid is 10, and where has OP been? College has breaks have they not been to a family events in that entire time, no Christmas, no Easter,  no summer. Plus, with phones and computers, it takes 2 seconds to see each other's faces and say hey. I went through college, and my brother got his masters we live in different states his kids know me well and love me, it take nothing but a small amount of effort. OP doesn't ever actually explain why they ghosted their whole family except for repeating because school. That is messed up with breaks even when working you have time or can make time. OP choose not to and wonders why their family is a bit cold and calling them an A. They are, for no valid reason, they gave, cutting off their family.", "Eeeeh.\n\nI was absolutely ready to vote N T A off the title. Your education should come before your nephew.\n\nBut OP lives close enough to her sister and nephew to bump into them randomly and yet sees them so rarely her nephew literally does not know what she looks like? He's ten years old. Ten year olds can recognize people they see once a year at a single holiday. Heck, my father's family lived in another country growing up. We saw them for one holiday *every other* year and I still recognized all of them (which is liked 24 people). \n\nI don't think sister is an asshole here. It would hurt my feelings too if my brother (I don't have a sister) didn't care about me enough to spend any time with me (or my family) for years on end. I love my brother, and it would just suck if it was clear he really didn't care about me (or my kids) back. \n\nIt's one thing to be busy with school. I get that. But there are school breaks and getting together enough to be in living memory isn't a huge ask.", "Taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot.", "Exactly! I was overseas the first year of my niece\u2019s life and this was before Skype. I came home, my SIL said who\u2019s that and my niece walked right up to a photo of me and pointed\u2026 it works both ways.", ">Making your way in the world today takes everything you\u2019ve got\n\nTaking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot.\n\nWouldn't you like to get away?", "I don't think OP did anything wrong but there is a pretty big difference between revolving your life around your nephew and knowing him well enough that he recognizes who you are when you cross paths in public.", "Grad students make poverty money. On top of the unbelievably demanding schedule, OP is probably working on weekends just to eat. One of my partner\u2019s MFA classmates was rationing ramen packets until their next (tiny) paycheck hit. They make like $1200 a month.", "I'm in grad school now, getting a master's in Special Education, and I can assure you, YES, I am skipping almost every party and holiday to keep up with my program. I am also a teacher full time, so I have NO time for my family these days.", "I agree with you. I am five hours away from my nephews and nieces. I do get there a couple times a year, but they have always known who I am. My siblings have pictures, talk about us to them, and I have not had an instances in feeling disconnected. OP could have made an effort to call or send a quick card over the years. Still NTA.", "OK, but what were the family dramas from OPs childhood? There's obviously more to this whole situation.  Maybe there's childhood trauma influencing things, not just \"education as an excuse\". Maybe OP doesn't recover well from family visits. Maybe OP focusses on study to avoid backsliding into unhealthy behaviours. Maybe OP isn't good with kids and hasn't been raised to know how to establish the connections you are taking for granted.", "tbh this, sure putting your education first is your perogative but you cannot tell me that in 10 years you have literally never had any time to spend with your nephew.", "Yeah I don't think she's neccesarily wrong for how she's lived her life, but it does seem like she is really crutching on her education as an excuse to ghost her family (for whatever reason, sometimes you gotta do what you need to for your own sake). From the sound of it though it sounds like she hasn't even MET her nephew really, and if she was able to run into them at the store it's not like she has the excuse of living too far away to pop in occasionally for a family event.", "And what does it matter?\n\nShe's mot obligated or required to spend time or have a relationship with her nephew.", "I can't speak to OP's motivations, but sometimes it just works out that way, it's not a deliberate choice.  I did the college + PhD thing, and it definitely resulting in having some younger family members who I barely know.  I was gone for ten years, I pretty much missed the foundational part of their lives, only really being around at the holidays.  It wasn't deliberate, but I made a choice about prioritizing education over family.\n\nNow they're adults and I can have a conversation with them, but will probably never be close.  That's just life sometimes.  Sending a text or card at birthdays doesn't make up for time spent in person.  \n\nIt sounds like OP is local so that changes the dynamic, but just wanted to share an experience.", "It can't she didn't see her family because she didn't want to", "Her nephew not recognizing her doesn\u2019t make her an asshole tho \ud83d\udc80 regardless of reasons for being occupied, how is that morally wrong?", "I was thinking the same thing. In a 10 year span OP doesn\u2019t FaceTime or pop in every now and then, birthday parties , holidays etc.? This is either a shit excuse or OP isn\u2019t being transparent about the real reason why she has little to no contact with family.", "All of your relatives view your kid as just some random stranger's kid? That's deeply weird.", "Super weird your family doesn't gaf about your kid", "How about... Money? Having summer full time job or even two?", "Grad students make poverty wages during the academic year. During summer breaks, they\u2019re most likely working so they can afford to spend the rest of the year making *very*, ***very*** little money. On holiday breaks like fall or Christmas, they still have academic obligations. Theses, proposals, grading their own students (grad students teach a *LOT* of GenEd courses).", "PhD students don't really get summer breaks.  If anything you're taking the break from classes to get research done.", "Because if you want a relationship with your nephew or niece you have to actually care about them? I'm not showing my kid pics of my sister who doesn't care about them.  Op is a stranger to this kid because she wants to be. This isn't on the sister at all", "There's absolutely no way I'd let my kid have a relationship with a random relative that ignored them their entire childhood", "I moved away from my family for higher education.\n\nWhen my child was very young, I made a picture book of the relatives and we would go through it so my child would recognize them in the future.  Its not hard.", "She said she was always working whenever not in class,  to put herself through school,  with 1 admin day for studying (and any other appts). Very limited time.  I do find it weird that she didn't spend any holidays at all, but OP also said she had a not great childhood.   She didn't give details, but if it was traumatic, I can see why she wouldn't try to reconnect.", "Wouldn't you like get away, where everybody knows your name?\n\nI know I should be thinking \"Cheers\" but I can't help but immediately go to \"Adventure Time\".", "That\u2019s a lot different. Her nephew is 10 and has no idea who she is .\n\nThis makes me think she hasn\u2019t seen her in at least two years . This is not bad in itself but if she actually likes her sister or nephew more effort is needed .", "Literally. I don\u2019t know what people are talking about. Her sister is not asking her to babysit her son but to see them at once a year is very normal .\n\nIf you don\u2019t want a relationship with your sister it\u2019s fine but if you do , she should definitely make more effort", "She may have had little spare time, that she probably wanted to spend otherwise than looking at sister's child. Not all people are into kids that much. She may have used her little free time to simply relax.", "What matters is she\u2019s using her education as an excuse to have nothing to do with her family. That\u2019s the AH part. If she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with them, that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s her choice. There\u2019s no way in hell that in the decade since her nephew was born, she had no free time to visit with family. There are considerable breaks between semesters, plenty of time to visit with family and friends if she wanted to. So yes, using her education as an excuse to ghost her family is the AH part of this. Maybe she doesn\u2019t care about her family. That\u2019s her choice, but using her education as an excuse is just terrible", "OP is an asshole because they refuse to acknowledge that multiple behaviors and choices led to this outcome not simply a prioritization of education.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic example of people not wanting to take responsibility and accountability for the way their life is.  \n\nRegardless of whether or not choosing to be uninvolved is asshole behavior I am addressing the lack of personal accountability to the outcome for which OP is an asshole.", "She's an AH cuz she just won't admit she doesn't care about them lol cut them off. Let them go. Sorry excuse for an aunt", "So not education related", "Summer full time jobs still have days off. She\u2019s NTA for  working on her education, but she\u2019s an AH for using it as an excuse to ghost her family. In a decade she couldn\u2019t be bothered to visit them during holidays or birthdays? FaceTime? Her family obviously lives in the same area if she ran across her sister and nephew at the store. She made the decision to go no contact. She doesn\u2019t care about her family and that\u2019s fine for whatever reason.

But actively choosing to not have a relationship with your sister's son whatsoever is an ah move.", "How does she not care about them?? lol not having time to visit doesn\u2019t mean she not doesn\u2019t care about them", "It is, because someone has to pay for that education.", "I just read the start of op's post, 1st paragraph, she states that she had pretty bad childhood where she didn't really talk out issues, didn't feel comfortable to do so. I see this pattern repeat itself. And her sister being all accusing doesn't help op to open up.", "If a 10 year old doesn't know who you are it's because you don't care. Even if Op doesn't have time to visit a phone call takes 10 minutes and can be done while driving or walking somewhere. A birthday and Christmas gift can be pretty inexpensive and shows the child you care.", "So it is not education related", "Right, I get that. But using her education as an excuse is the AH part. If she didn\u2019t want to see her family, own up to it. She\u2019s an adult and had been working on her education for a decade.

She can prioritise whatever she wants or needs. Also, if she lives in America, summer job is clearly education related. People there have to have them, in order to not drown in debt.", "It's not like her sister's kid will pay for her studies\ud83d\ude02or her sister. If her sister is so against that, she's welcome to chip in.", "So she didn't prioritize her education she just didn't want to see her family", "She prioritied her financial stability. Her family could have helped out. They didn't bother.", "You sound incredibly out of touch", "How do we know they didn't help her?", "Based on what", "Cause then she'd probably call them.
