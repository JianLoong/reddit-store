Send him a small gift or call on a holiday.  What you do now until he is 18 matters.  If he plays a sport or performs in a show, try to go to a game or show.  It matters to him while he is young.  Be there for him in a way your family did not know how to be there for you.  Doing so in the younger years makes a difference.  It sets the relationship for later if he will have fond memories of you and want to be with you.  10 year olds like adults.  Teens less so.  Show up now if you can.  Enjoy and get to know him.

Rather than totting up the hours of her time just to prove to a bunch of internet strangers why she could not POSSIBLY have had a relationship with sister and nephew, she should look at why she didn't try. The findings would be a good opening to have a heart-to-heart with sister, and mend/salvage what positive relationships she might be able to find in parts of her family.", "OP mentions every spare time is used to earn enough money to cover school and her living expenses.  Her family isn't helping in anyway - it's possible she's NC with mom and dad due to her *\"not great childhood\"* and doesn't feel the need to participate in family holidays, I totally understand why she would prioritize her livelihood over making nice with family.", "OP has very little free time.

Tight family relationships weren't likely modeled.  Parents would have been working to keep these bonds intact in a healthy family too.  Maybe help financing college and holiday travel.  Not a surprising outcome but it's not totally on the OP IMO.", "Agreed, and depending on the family environment she grew up on I fully support that, I just don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t say it here on Reddit - we aren\u2019t the ones she needs to pretend to lol", "Then why didnt OP said that?

OP's sister can remain mad then, while pointing the finger at OP and not getting what she claims she ultimately wants - a relationship between her son and her sister.\n\nBut OP has no obligation to deprioritize her education for someone else's wants, just as OP's sister can choose not to help build a relationship between the two.\n\nIt just seems odd that OP's sister claims she wants them to have a relationship, gets mad that they don't, blames OP that they don't, and does nothing to change it.", "Of course she's allowed, that's not the question. She can make her own decisions and still be a bit of an asshole, which she is.

None of us have any issue with this, nor do we think he\u2019s an Asshole.", "He doesn't know her though.  And I get we're doing the Reddit \"every man is born an island and you don't owe anyone anything\" thing, but if you actually are interested in your family, you need to invest some time and effort in them.\n\nOP just doesn't seem that interested in her family, which is fine, but it's not because of her education, it's just because she doesn't care about them.\n\nI say this as someone who has 3 degrees and spent a lot of time in university libraries on a pretty complicated education.", "Ok, but tomorrow those friends might decide that they don\u2019t owe you their time either. Or they might move away or decide to focus on their family. It\u2019s pretty easy to end up old and lonely if you cut off everyone who is no longer useful to you. I would rather not burn my bridges with people who are part of my community for no real reason.", "Well we can only make judgements here based on the info provided. It's expected that there will be differences of opinion, but I think it's mildly asshole-ish. It's really not hard to show up to a family gathering for a few hours on a holiday, and it kind of seems like she just didn't want to be bothered.", "Again, it isnt about obligations.", "But you can recognize him from a lineup, right?", "So because she\u2019s busy in college and working enough to survive while in college, she is an asshole and doesn\u2019t care about her family \ud83d\udc80 yeah that\u2019s not realistic. He didn\u2019t recognize her, doesn\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t know her.\nI feel like that would apply to your own kids that you chose to have or your partner but not your sister who also doesn\u2019t choose to go out of her way to bring her nephew to visit you, has her own life to live and the kids she chose to have. \n\nCongrats? Just because if you wouldn\u2019t care about your family if you didn\u2019t buy them gifts or see them often, doesn\u2019t mean no one else cares when they don\u2019t.", "Reddit seems to be so concerned with how people spend their time.", "Not everyone has the best family structure.  You don\u2019t owe your family your time.", "Choosing to spend her time the way she needs to between work, school and personal life doesn\u2019t make her the asshole. \n\nWhen I was in grad school and working my time was very finite.  She\u2019s been in undergrad, grad school and post grad for man years.   She\u2019s had to work with little time for a long time and has made sacrifices with that time.", "Doesn\u2019t matter if I can or I can\u2019t.  I don\u2019t feel obligated to his time.  I don\u2019t feel offended if he chooses not to participate in things.  It\u2019s his choice and it affects me exactly zero percent.", "if the kid can't pull his own aunt from a line up, he doesn't know her.  He knows she exists, but also knows she doesn't really want anything to do with him.\n\nShe doesn't care because she made no effort at all to even be recognizable to her own sister's kid.\n\nI was busy in college for about 8 years - I still made time to at least talk to my cousins in a country halfway around the world from me.  This Aunt hasn't shown her face to her nephew since he was born.\n\nIt's not about gifts.  It's just showing effort in some way - can't show up; give something small, a greeting card can be mailed and takes no time from your busy schedule.\n\nShe showed no effort at all.", "\n>So because she\u2019s busy in college and working enough to survive while in college\n\nCountless people are able to do both. OP is letting her education be an excuse for her disinterest in her family. Whether that's justified or not, who knows, that's for OP to handle.\n\n>yeah that\u2019s not realistic\n\n Your family being upset with you for not caring about them is unrealistic? Maybe that's the case for you and OP, but that's far from \"normal\". If OP has a genuinely abusive family and that's why she's so detached, then she should have said that in the post. \n\n>Congrats? Just because if you wouldn\u2019t care about your family if you didn\u2019t buy them gifts or see them often, doesn\u2019t mean no one else cares when they don\u2019t.\n\nI'm so confused by this lmao. If you applied your own logic right here on OP, then you'd also be saying that OP doesn't care about her family.", "And they're fully in the right for calling you an asshole for feeling that way", "It kinda does matter a bit if you want to make the claim that you are \"family\".\n\nEDIT:\nI get the concept of not being entitled to someone's time.  But at the same time, some reciprocity is important in every relationship.  If you have children and your brother-in-law never takes a second to interact with your kid in a decade, to the point your kid doesn't recognize him, would you not be a little bit miffed?", "Based on the fact that you\u2019re refusing to acknowledge that working was to FUND THEIR EDUCATION and therefore directly related to OPS EDUCATION. So yes, putting funding their education first is the same as putting their education first. \n\nI hope you\u2019re doing this on purpose otherwise it\u2019s just disappointing."]}
