At this point I have a nephew who was 18 months old at the time. I was supporting myself through college so when I wasn't at college I was working and I only had one day off which I used as a study/admin day. As a result I didn't see my family a lot. \n\nAfter I graduated I did a masters which was a 2-year course and that was Monday to Friday and I had to work weekends as I was supporting myself so I rarely saw my family. \n\nI've now moved on to completing a PhD which requires me to dedicate 80% of my time on this and I'm also working weekends just so I can pay the bills and put food in my belly. I'm in my final year and I'm not going to sit here and pretend its been an easy ride throughout my education. \n\nOn Monday I was in town and bumped into my sister who was with my nephew (he's around ten now) he didn't even recognise me as his aunt. I had some time to spare before I had to go back to college and we took my nephew to the park. \n\nWhilst my nephew was playing with the other kids at the park my sister said I'm an asshole because my own nephew doesn't recognise me as an aunt because I've barely been around him and I'm always focused on my education. I said to my sister that I feel bad for him but I'm not going to be apologetic for putting my education first as I think anyone would put their education first. \n\nAs soon as I said this she grabbed my nephew and left the park so I walked back to college as I had to access the campus to do some things.

Did she offer to make you some meals, invite you to dinner, send you pics of nephew?  Her interaction with you was more a drive-by shooting than a visit with family.", "I\u2019ve 2 nephews I don\u2019t see much as they live far. My sister has said that although I don\u2019t see them much they emulate me and they look up to me in so many ways. You are being a role model even though they don\u2019t see you much. She should have been maximising your interactions and pointing out to them how far you have come and how well you are doing. Unfortunately she doesn\u2019t have that type of parenting skills. Keep doing what you are doing so they know it\u2019s possible and achievable when you put the work and dedication in. Especially one of their family members.

You didn't drop out of your Ph.D. program or quit the job you need to by luxuries like food so you could gaze at him for hours at a time every day?

Now, if you ignored your own children, that\u2019d be a different story.   \nYou built a life that you wanted. You placed education first, most people would not. That doesn\u2019t make you wrong, it makes your choices unusual for most.   \nThe thing you cannot expect is that you\u2019ll have a close, loving family when/if you have your children.", "NAH I think typical graduate students are able to juggle school and family. I think you didn't have that luxury and did what you had to do. Congratulations on your success.", "ETA. You have had an enormous amount of school, but you can still stay in touch with family while doing so. People go through the same path as you have being married and having their own children. I did more than 2 years of school while working full time and a single mom of three kids. I worked in a college at a university so I am aware of what is needed to reach each of your degrees. You had the time & availability if you had wanted it badly enough.  \n\nI haven\u2019t seen my ex SIL and family in years yet her girls know who I am, including the one who was less than six months old when we separated. This is 100% because their parents made an effort to make sure their daughter\u2019s know who is the mom of their cousins. Your sister could have done the same. \n\nIt is a shame that you don\u2019t have a better relationship with your nephew.", "You didn\u2019t need to match her comment with a negative comment.  You could have said I would like to know my nephew.  You can still get to know him.  It\u2019s not too late.  Put a reminder in your phone when his birthday is.  Send him a small gift or call on a holiday.  What you do now until he is 18 matters.  If he plays a sport or performs in a show, try to go to a game or show.  It matters to him while he is young.  Be there for him in a way your family did not know how to be there for you.  Doing so in the younger years makes a difference.  It sets the relationship for later if he will have fond memories of you and want to be with you.  10 year olds like adults.  Teens less so.  Show up now if you can.  Enjoy and get to know him.  It doesn\u2019t have to take a lot of time.  Just a desire to know him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your education is the single most important achievement during a large part of your life. If you have to do it by yourself with no help from family, there is not much time to socialize. Your sister chose to have a child. Whether or not this child regcognizes you as his aunt or not is unimportant in the wider scope of things. You, on the other hand, finishing your education at the level you desire is perhaps going to take everything you have.
