I\u2019m sure they\u2019re frustrated at having to repaint their roof, and haven\u2019t yet come to the realization that it\u2019s their own fault.

Preventing that is what the regulations are for.", "I would normally have said it\u2019s an ah move to cost them money like that, but white metal roofs are ridiculously reflective. They knew the rules and lied. NTA v", "I mean, when you knowingly violate regulations (as they did), the risk you run is that you will be compelled to fix the thing that you did wrong. If you think the regulation should be changed go ahead and fight city hall about it. However, those regulations are usually in place for a reason. Many folks in the comments are dismissing how problematic the color white can be in bright sun. Those of us in snowy regions are well aware that bright sun on white (in our case, usually snow) can be literally blinding. Snow blindness is essentially a sunburn in your cornea. The extreme example would be looking directly at a welding arc without a welding helmet, or staring directly at the sun without sunglasses. The neighbor\u2019s roof would obviously not fall within that extreme, but the same effect is taking place. The same function that makes it so attractive as a roof color for cooling the dwelling is exactly what makes it somewhere between unpleasant and actively dangerous for neighbors- all that UV radiation from the sun is being reflected off the roof away from the house- and directly into OP\u2019s eyes.\n\nBottom line is, they knew they weren\u2019t allowed to do this thing, they decided to do the thing anyway, and they got caught. OP is NTA for ensuring that they play by the same rules as everybody else. They\u2019re not special; the rules *do* apply to them too.", "NTA.  They were blinding you and they broke the regulations.\n\nYour city is wrong (IMO) to require a black roof, though - it contributes to urban (or even sub/exurban) heat island effect. There is probably a compromise (grey maybe?) they could have achieved to reduce blinding and offset some of the potential heat absorption.", "yeah no, they were inconsiderate\n\nnta\n\nETA they knew they were wrong to do it --or they wouldn't have lied about it.", "I mean I think I would have tried to talk to them myself first, but if that didn\u2019t work I\u2019d ultimately do exactly what you did anyways.

You might have been able to have playdates?", "NTA but how did they know you made the complaint?", "NTA. Are they avoiding just you or all of the neighborhood? Do they know you called?", "Definitely the asshole - if you didn't go and speak to them first to explain the impact it was having on you and that it doesn't meet the code.  If after trying to work with them you then went to the city you wouldn't be the asshole.\n\nBut you're more a coward than an asshole", "YTA. People like you are the fucking WORST.  Imagine being offended by the colour of a roof.", "NTA\n\nBut did you seriously think that you could be friends after that?\n\nYou got what you wanted. The roof is repainted.\n\nThe consequence of that is that your neighbor wants absolutely nothing to do with you.", "ESH I guess as a neighbour I would have made friends and talked through the problem with them before going legal. I also would have tried to put anti glare contact on my windows first.

I'm just guessing because we live directly above them. There are other houses next to us, though.", "I don\u2019t think it was a required color.

In direct sunlight a white roof is blinding and theres a reason its against the cities code. OP is not the asshole in any way here", "Ever heard of snow blindness?", "I was thinking they used white instead due to energy conservation, since white roofed dwellings use less energy to keep cool.

I get that it's better for energy bills, but when you live in a community and your house is in such a position where if you paint your roof white it'll blind your neighbors and make it so they can't even be outside on their own damn property, then you need to learn to think about other people and not just yourself.", "Unless the roof blinds passing drivers, which could be fatal.", "I don't know to be honest.
