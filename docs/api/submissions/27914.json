If you think the regulation should be changed go ahead and fight city hall about it. However, those regulations are usually in place for a reason. Many folks in the comments are dismissing how problematic the color white can be in bright sun. Those of us in snowy regions are well aware that bright sun on white (in our case, usually snow) can be literally blinding. Snow blindness is essentially a sunburn in your cornea. The extreme example would be looking directly at a welding arc without a welding helmet, or staring directly at the sun without sunglasses. The neighbor\u2019s roof would obviously not fall within that extreme, but the same effect is taking place. The same function that makes it so attractive as a roof color for cooling the dwelling is exactly what makes it somewhere between unpleasant and actively dangerous for neighbors- all that UV radiation from the sun is being reflected off the roof away from the house- and directly into OP\u2019s eyes.\n\nBottom line is, they knew they weren\u2019t allowed to do this thing, they decided to do the thing anyway, and they got caught.

They were blinding you and they broke the regulations.\n\nYour city is wrong (IMO) to require a black roof, though - it contributes to urban (or even sub/exurban) heat island effect.
