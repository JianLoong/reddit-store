But that's what your neighbors get for living somewhere with neighbors. The countryside is a much better lifestyle, no one gets to boss you around about what to do with your own home.", "Not sure if YTA, but you're definitely the snitch.", "NTA because I can see how white would be blinding at times\n\nHowever, I also understand why they wouldn\u2019t want to associate with you. You aren\u2019t an AH because of that though, they made the choice to lie in their paperwork.", "NTA", "Yta", "NTA.  It was distracting and broke city codes. I mean,  you could have filled ballons with paint and thrown them onto their roof, but your way was faster. They're lucky the city just made them paint it, not tear it off.", "Some council regulations are stupid but they're there for a reason. They could've applied for permission but chose to defraud the system. They're lucky they didn't get their occupation certificate taken off of them.", "YTA if you wanted to preserve the relationship with your neighbors, you should have talked to them about their roof before taking it to officials.", "With no context? YTA. \n\nIf there was context? YTA", "ESH. First you complained for your benefit do you are self serving.  Second, the city official should be fired for releasing private information to a third party.  That was none of your business  but I see why you added it to fulfill your self justification. They should follow codes. However after your non-neighborly snitching, I do not blame them for wanting nothing to do with you.", "YTA bc it doesn\u2019t sound like you even tried to talk to them b4 you snitched on them. These violations come with fines etc and you know that so you should have realized this wasn\u2019t going to go over well. If you approached them and they acted like jerks and refused to change it then fine, call the city but that shouldn\u2019t have been step one.", "YTA. It sounds like you didn\u2019t talk to them at all and just went to the city to rat on them. Not only did you cost them money, you embarrassed them. No wonder they want nothing to do with you.", "NTA they lied on the application so they obviously knew they were doing something wrong", "NTA\n\nThey lied and got caught. This is their own fault.", "They knowingly broke the rules, which apparently are there for a reason. What else was OP supposed to do?", "I do agree that it's better to live somewhere else if you don't want to follow regulations.", "Why?", "They didn't live there for several months, there was no way we could contact them. They city wouldn't give us their information either.", "I'm wondering what we should have done then. Just lived with the roof? \n\nBut I do agree that the city shouldn't have told us that they didn't follow regulations.", "There aren't any fines for something like this in our country.", "I\u2019d normally agree with this approach but c\u2019mon, no one is going to re-tile their roof based on a polite suggestion. Contacting the regulator was appropriate here. It\u2019s not like this created a criminal record.", "Any cost is their fault for lying on the paperwork in the first place. Yes some city/HOA rules are stupid, but some are there for a reason. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.", "They didn't live there for several months, there was no way we could contact them. They city wouldn't give us their information either.", "\u2026\u2026How are you planning playdates when they aren\u2019t there for several months????", "Then what would happen if they refused to repaint?", "I find that hard to believe but even if true you forced them to fix this on your timeline without even a hello, how are you, welcome to the neighborhood. There\u2019s no guarantee they would have been receptive but now we\u2019ll never know. Calling the city was always an option but again it shouldn\u2019t have been option one.", "They're living here now, but weren't in the past when the roof issue happened, which is why I made the post...?", "They could have refused but then they can't sell the house.", "It would\u2019ve been one thing if they flat out didn\u2019t know, but they lied on their paperwork about what color they\u2019d be painting it. Any fines would\u2019ve been 100% their fault.", "Yes they lied for whatever reason but I doubt it was to blind their neighbors. Many folks bend rules and sure if they get caught they deserve their consequences. But you don\u2019t make a happy, healthy, safe neighborhood dynamic if you can\u2019t use your words like an adult and speak to them directly. Like I said the neighbors could have been jerks or they could have apologized/fixed it and it would be a fun meet cute for the kids to tell when they explain in the future how they\u2019ve been best friends since they were 3. Now there is no chance of that. And if you\u2019ve been online for a minute I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen some posts about nightmare neighbor feuds. OP technically threw the first shot by ratting them out instead of at least trying to work it out beforehand.", "They didn't live there for a few months, there was no way we could contact them. They city wouldn't give us their information either.", "Ok that\u2019s fair. I take it back bc if you can\u2019t contact them there\u2019s not much you could do and who knows they could have taken a year to move in. Edit your post to reflect that bc that makes a difference. I\u2019m changing to NTA. \n\nThat said maybe a peace offering and an apology but tell them \u201cwe had no way to contact you and just assumed it was a mistake. Sorry for the inconvenience but I hope we can be friendly neighbors\u201d and if they are still mad well that\u2019s their problem.", "How do the neighbors know it was you who said something?", "That's the thing, we did bring them a gift to welcome them to the neighborhood and I wanted to say sorry but my husband (a local of the country we're living in) said we shouldn't mention it because it would be awkward.\n\nThey don't know it was exactly us that contacted the city but since we're the house directly above them, it's easy to guess.\n\nEdit: I also defer to what my husband says is right to do since I'm a North American living in his East Asian country.", "I am just assuming because we are directly above them and the husband won't let his kid play with ours. But my kid is also half-foreign (I'm North American, my husband is East Asian, we're in East Asia) so that could be it as well. I don't know.", "Ok yeah again it sounds like there is a lot more context we need. At this point just play it by ear. Who knows maybe the kids will become pals anyway and hopefully the neighbors will come around. Good luck and glad you got that fixed bc the thought of the white blinding roof made MY eyes hurt!", "Yes, it's kind of a complicated situation, especially considering the culture, and now I am kind of regretting posting on here. \n\nBut I appreciate your kind words and I also hope the kiddos will naturally get along and somehow the adults can mend our relationship."]}
