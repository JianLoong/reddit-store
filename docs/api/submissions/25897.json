(I make a nice amount and since I have no kids and no partner, I was happy to splurge.)\n\nThe next birthday I got custom stuff from pottery barn. It was this birthday that my sister seemed to latch to the idea that I would go above and beyond every birthday.\n\nThird birthday was a tiny driveable car. Fourth was an American girl doll trip. Fifth was an ipad. I didn\u2019t object to the gift ideas my sister gave, I was happy to spoil my niece. \n\nWell this year for her birthday my sister didn\u2019t tell me what she wanted. I asked a few times but she said she was \u201cin between ideas\u201d When I heard nothing back, I got her a Nintendo switch since I remember her saying she wanted one.\n\nCut to the party last Friday. We\u2019re gathered around watching her open gifts when my sister passes her an envelope. Knowing it wasn\u2019t the gift I brought, I thought nothing of it until she opened it. She gave her mother a look, my sister whispered something, and my niece started screaming. \n\nThe envelope had a picture of Mickey Mouse. My sister had just told her I was taking her to Disney World. \n\nI sat there kinda stunned and expected it to be a joke for a minute. However everyone started to cheer and it became obvious there was no joke. \n\nI tried to meet my sisters eyes but she avoided mine.

I didn\u2019t want to ruin the day, and the words rushing my mind surely would. I wanted to just make a quiet exit but of course, my sister followed me. She was confused on why I was leaving, and most importantly why I was mad. She kept saying that this was what my niece really wanted and there was no way I would ruin her party by leaving. \n\nI stared. Waiting for her to realize how insane of an ask this was. Her expression remained the same so I simply said \u201cNo I won\u2019t be the one to ruin it. You now get to tell her the trip is simply not happening.\u201d And walked out. \n\nI got a ton of calls from my sister and my parents and after talking, my family thinks I shouldn\u2019t have walked out and worse, most of the family think I should do it. Price aside, as someone who has never travelled solo with a kid, especially in a place like Disney, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable. \n\nI was okay buying her pricey gifts but this will be well over what I normally spend. I know I didn\u2019t help the problem by agreeing to buy what she asked for but at least to me, a trip should be discussed beforehand. \n\nI\u2019m torn. Since I can afford to should I just do it?

This is blackmail, and thousands.\n\nTell everyone who pressures you that Sister will be happy they have volunteered to do this trip. That gives them the same choice Sister gave you. If they keep it up, give them a time out. Your entire family has lost its mind thinking this is in any way okay. They need to learn to respect you.\n\nP.S. Future presents to Niece might be better if they are attention instead of money. Help her build a treehouse, take her camping, teach her to sew. She will love and remember that you made time for her.", "NTA and no don't do it! This will just be the beginning. Take a stand now. Your sister will continue to extort you if you don't stop this and your family telling you you're wrong are ridiculous. This is entirely on your sister.", "NTA, your sister is taking advantage of you and using her own child to guilt you. Make sure your niece knows who was behind this nonsense before your sister poisons her against you. And don\u2019t take her to Disneyland, at least not until she\u2019s older", "You are a very nice and convenient ATM. your sister tried to \"defraud\" you. Crazy and totally unacceptable.", "nta", "NTA. \n\nA way to handle it at the time \n- excuse yourself to bathroom \n- send group text to the family members plus sister present \"this is the first I've heard of a Disney trip. Firstly I'm not able to take her, secondly the trip will cost $xxxxx. To avoid disappointing her I would be happy to contribute a share of xyz if everyone else contributes. If you're all not on board with this I think it's cruel to let niece believe this trip will happen. Let me know what you all think\". \n\nThen return and remain at the party as though everything is normal. That way you don't ruin the party and everyone gets to enjoy being suddenly on the hook for sister and niece.", "NTA. Your sister is another story. Do not take her on a trip to Disney because your sister is the one who caused this situation. Let her take the fallout. \n\nThe entitlement your sister has towards YOUR money is mindblowing! Something like this just demonstrates that your sister only sees you for what you can do for her. And if your parents and whoever else is telling you that you should do it don\u2019t get how wrong this is, then I feel sorry for your niece", "Nta. She purposefully left you in the dark and made you look like the bad person. I have neices too and i would not feel confident taking them to Disney all by myself either", "you are not the asshole and your sister is in the wrong her and u shouldn\u2019t be doing something that makes u feel uncomfortable and not spend more money because your sister wanted to be selfish and not tell you what your niece wanted for her birthday", "\"Almost\" a trap? \nIt WAS a trap!\nDon't let your sister get away with it.\nAs others already have said, your sister will keep expecting your niece getting the nice expensive gifts from you, and if she has got the audacity to pull this stunt once, she'll most likely do it again.\nYou need to enforce your boundaries now.\nFor good.", "When niece and sister looked at you I would have said \"I knew nothing about this trip, you bever told me what niece wanted so I brought her a switch, it's this present here\" then walked out if sister went hostile.\n\nYou definitely handled this better than I would have, and as much as it sucks for your niece right now, I think you need to pull back on the expensive gifts. NTA but your sister is  trying  to make you one in everyone's eyes. She knew you would say no, that is why she set up her trap and her sneaky entitlement is why she deserved your reaction.", "You need to keep refusing and don\u2019t dare give in- you were set up by your sister and then she tried to use your niece and being in front of everyone to manipulate you.  That\u2019s all levels of fucked up.  \n\nA switch for a 6 year old is an amazingly generous gift.  A trip to Disney is freaking ridiculous\n\nI\u2019d be switching the way you approach gifts going forward.  Something small for her to play with and then things like paying for her soccer or dance classes.  Or take her to a concert or Disney on ice or something.  This would be it for me, I\u2019d be distancing myself from my sister if she pulled that\n\nYou\u2019re her aunt and want to have a loving relationship with her, if her mom teaches her to look at you as a piggy bank that will ruin any good relationship you could have with her.  Walk it all back for your own sake, quality time over presents is the way to go", "Absolutely, it was a trap. She figured you'd just go along with it rather than disappoint your niece. No way in hell should you take a six year old on a trip like that. \n\nI don't know where you live relative to Disney or if this was just supposed to be a one day thing. I just know that a six year old is almost certain to have a meltdown at some point because mommy and/or daddy aren't there. \n\nMy parents had to come in the middle of the night to pick me up from my grandma's at about that age. I loved my grandma. Nothing had happened, I just suddenly wanted to be *home*. I was in the same town, so not a huge deal. Maybe hundreds of miles away? Nope. Very. Very. VERY. Bad. Idea. NTA and stick to your guns.\n\nAnd if they were expecting you to pay for the whole family? Yeah, fuck that sideways.", "Did you take back the switch?", "You need to set some boundaries with your sister  now and stick to them.", "Guess what? Your sister expects you to pay for college, and your niece\u2019s wedding!", "Why don\u2019t your parents take her. NTA", "You don't want to spend your money and time on a luxury item for your niece. This isn't like you're withholding money for lifesaving treatments.\n\nNTA. Her kid will fine not going to Disney.", "Then they should be happy to help out their struggling single daughter and take their grandchild to Disney.", "Do not do anything for this trip.  If you give in to their blackmail once they will never stop.", "Your sister has balls of steel and a pea sized brain!", "I'm wondering what the follow up for a Disney trip is?  By the time the kid is grown up, OP will have bought cars, trips around the world, and a new house for the kid to live in too.   The sky is the limit until OP says no."]}
