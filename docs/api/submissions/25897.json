(I make a nice amount and since I have no kids and no partner, I was happy to splurge.)\n\nThe next birthday I got custom stuff from pottery barn. It was this birthday that my sister seemed to latch to the idea that I would go above and beyond every birthday.\n\nThird birthday was a tiny driveable car. Fourth was an American girl doll trip. Fifth was an ipad. I didn\u2019t object to the gift ideas my sister gave, I was happy to spoil my niece. \n\nWell this year for her birthday my sister didn\u2019t tell me what she wanted. I asked a few times but she said she was \u201cin between ideas\u201d When I heard nothing back, I got her a Nintendo switch since I remember her saying she wanted one.\n\nCut to the party last Friday. We\u2019re gathered around watching her open gifts when my sister passes her an envelope. Knowing it wasn\u2019t the gift I brought, I thought nothing of it until she opened it. She gave her mother a look, my sister whispered something, and my niece started screaming. \n\nThe envelope had a picture of Mickey Mouse. My sister had just told her I was taking her to Disney World. \n\nI sat there kinda stunned and expected it to be a joke for a minute. However everyone started to cheer and it became obvious there was no joke. \n\nI tried to meet my sisters eyes but she avoided mine.

I didn\u2019t want to ruin the day, and the words rushing my mind surely would. I wanted to just make a quiet exit but of course, my sister followed me. She was confused on why I was leaving, and most importantly why I was mad. She kept saying that this was what my niece really wanted and there was no way I would ruin her party by leaving. \n\nI stared. Waiting for her to realize how insane of an ask this was. Her expression remained the same so I simply said \u201cNo I won\u2019t be the one to ruin it. You now get to tell her the trip is simply not happening.\u201d And walked out. \n\nI got a ton of calls from my sister and my parents and after talking, my family thinks I shouldn\u2019t have walked out and worse, most of the family think I should do it. Price aside, as someone who has never travelled solo with a kid, especially in a place like Disney, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable. \n\nI was okay buying her pricey gifts but this will be well over what I normally spend. I know I didn\u2019t help the problem by agreeing to buy what she asked for but at least to me, a trip should be discussed beforehand. \n\nI\u2019m torn. Since I can afford to should I just do it?

Future presents to Niece might be better if they are attention instead of money. Help her build a treehouse, take her camping, teach her to sew. She will love and remember that you made time for her.", "NTA and no don't do it! This will just be the beginning. Take a stand now. Your sister will continue to extort you if you don't stop this and your family telling you you're wrong are ridiculous. This is entirely on your sister.", "NTA, your sister is taking advantage of you and using her own child to guilt you. Make sure your niece knows who was behind this nonsense before your sister poisons her against you. And don\u2019t take her to Disneyland, at least not until she\u2019s older", "You are a very nice and convenient ATM. your sister tried to \"defraud\" you. Crazy and totally unacceptable.", "nta", "NTA. \n\nA way to handle it at the time \n- excuse yourself to bathroom \n- send group text to the family members plus sister present \"this is the first I've heard of a Disney trip. Firstly I'm not able to take her, secondly the trip will cost $xxxxx. To avoid disappointing her I would be happy to contribute a share of xyz if everyone else contributes. If you're all not on board with this I think it's cruel to let niece believe this trip will happen. Let me know what you all think\". \n\nThen return and remain at the party as though everything is normal. That way you don't ruin the party and everyone gets to enjoy being suddenly on the hook for sister and niece.", "NTA. Your sister is another story. Do not take her on a trip to Disney because your sister is the one who caused this situation. Let her take the fallout. \n\nThe entitlement your sister has towards YOUR money is mindblowing! Something like this just demonstrates that your sister only sees you for what you can do for her. And if your parents and whoever else is telling you that you should do it don\u2019t get how wrong this is, then I feel sorry for your niece", "Nta. She purposefully left you in the dark and made you look like the bad person. I have neices too and i would not feel confident taking them to Disney all by myself either", "you are not the asshole and your sister is in the wrong her and u shouldn\u2019t be doing something that makes u feel uncomfortable and not spend more money because your sister wanted to be selfish and not tell you what your niece wanted for her birthday", "\"Almost\" a trap? \nIt WAS a trap!\nDon't let your sister get away with it.\nAs others already have said, your sister will keep expecting your niece getting the nice expensive gifts from you, and if she has got the audacity to pull this stunt once, she'll most likely do it again.\nYou need to enforce your boundaries now.\nFor good.", "When niece and sister looked at you I would have said \"I knew nothing about this trip, you never told me what niece wanted so I brought her a switch, it's this present here\" then walked out if sister went hostile.\n\nYou definitely handled this better than I would have, and as much as it sucks for your niece right now, I think you need to pull back on the expensive gifts. NTA but your sister is  trying  to make you one in everyone's eyes. She knew you would say no, that is why she set up her trap and her sneaky entitlement is why she deserved your reaction.", "You need to keep refusing and don\u2019t dare give in- you were set up by your sister and then she tried to use your niece and being in front of everyone to manipulate you.  That\u2019s all levels of fucked up.  \n\nA switch for a 6 year old is an amazingly generous gift.  A trip to Disney is freaking ridiculous\n\nI\u2019d be switching the way you approach gifts going forward.  Something small for her to play with and then things like paying for her soccer or dance classes.  Or take her to a concert or Disney on ice or something.  This would be it for me, I\u2019d be distancing myself from my sister if she pulled that\n\nYou\u2019re her aunt and want to have a loving relationship with her, if her mom teaches her to look at you as a piggy bank that will ruin any good relationship you could have with her.  Walk it all back for your own sake, quality time over presents is the way to go", "Absolutely, it was a trap. She figured you'd just go along with it rather than disappoint your niece. No way in hell should you take a six year old on a trip like that. \n\nI don't know where you live relative to Disney or if this was just supposed to be a one day thing. I just know that a six year old is almost certain to have a meltdown at some point because mommy and/or daddy aren't there. \n\nMy parents had to come in the middle of the night to pick me up from my grandma's at about that age. I loved my grandma. Nothing had happened, I just suddenly wanted to be *home*. I was in the same town, so not a huge deal. Maybe hundreds of miles away? Nope. Very. Very. VERY. Bad. Idea. NTA and stick to your guns.\n\nAnd if they were expecting you to pay for the whole family? Yeah, fuck that sideways.", "Did you take back the switch?", "You need to set some boundaries with your sister  now and stick to them.", "Guess what? Your sister expects you to pay for college, and your niece\u2019s wedding!", "Why don\u2019t your parents take her. NTA", "You don't want to spend your money and time on a luxury item for your niece. This isn't like you're withholding money for lifesaving treatments.\n\nNTA. Her kid will fine not going to Disney.", "Then they should be happy to help out their struggling single daughter and take their grandchild to Disney.", "Do not do anything for this trip.  If you give in to their blackmail once they will never stop.", "Your sister has balls of steel and a pea sized brain!", "I'm wondering what the follow up for a Disney trip is?  By the time the kid is grown up, OP will have bought cars, trips around the world, and a new house for the kid to live in too.   The sky is the limit until OP says no.", "How entitled is your sister? And how entitled is she going to make your niece. The stories in the house must be **don\u2019t worry auntie richie rich will buy it for you**. It\u2019s time to start choosing the gift yourself and not taking your sisters ever more expensive gift ideas anymore.", "NTA but stop buying exorbitant gifts for a 6 year old. You\u2019re setting yourself up to be drained by your sister with the pretense of \u201cbut niece deserves it\u201d. No five year old needs a damn tablet and she certainly shouldn\u2019t be expecting you to front the entirety of a trip for a child you did not create. I would pull back on gifts and start spending more along the lines of what your sister could afford. Do not back down and do not feel guilty, it is not your job to bankroll this child\u2019s life.", "I'm sorry, but after this stunt, I would set some hard boundaries with the sister and niece. Limit the present amount to generous but not over the top. How about dinner out, baby mani etc, things you could do together. \n\nI would also baulk at the Disney trip.\n\nStand your ground.", "NTA.  Your sister's behavior here was unhinged.  What kind of person does this??  \n\nShe is using you and being, at best, thoughtless regarding you and her daughter.", "NTA. She is taking advantage of you and tried to do it in public so you\u2019d have to do it. \n\nStop buying expensive presents.", "NTA. Your sister sounds insane and so does anyone that agrees with her. If she wants Disney so badly for her daughter, she can save up and take her herself. More like however, she wanted a super expensive gift experience for her daughter PLUS free time to herself. How selfish to put this all on you.", "No, you should not. \n\nI can't even imagine - I'm sorry but your family has major issues thinking this is okay and trying to coerce you to do this. \n\nThis is also horrible for your niece. Your sister has major moral judgment issues. She is the AH. \n\nI would communicate a firm no, and be very frank that this was completely disrespectful to you and her daughter. And that she is troubled if she doesn't get how F-ed up this. Not only the principle of this - but also, you are not their money tree. You are happy to gift your niece things - but in the capacity that you can and on your own terms. This was a betrayal. Your sister lacks basic ethics and morals to think this is an OK thing to do. \n\nI would step away from your family for a while. I feel bad for your niece who has a manipulative mom. This is not how you parent! \n\nAlso, in the future, be more pared down with gifts for your niece. I think it's kind and generous to give more when you can - but the intention of your sister has been shown. \n\nI think you should also go to therapy to learn more about boundaries with your family. I get they are family - but this is completely not normal.\n\nAlso - while your niece is definitely entitled to gifts - if your sister is struggling she should have asked for cash gifts to assess the best use of funds for her daughter (tbh no guarantee she would dedicate it to her daughter) or set up an education savings account to help her down the line. You have to make sure the $$ is going to the niece though. Instead of this splashy kid car, why not $$ directed at a college fund and smaller gifts.", "NTA. \u201cDear family, while it\u2019s true that I do have some solvent funds I do not have thousands of dollars worth of solvent funds which is what you all are trying to bully me into spending. If you wish [niece] to have this trip, you may all pool together money for her and [sister] to go. I will not be taking part in such an endeavor, neither via donation nor as a participant in such a trip. I had purchased her a switch, which I currently regret not taking with me when I left [niece\u2019s] party so as not to ruin the day for her. I was neither asked to fund nor even told about the existence of such a trip. Going forward, any gifts to [niece] that come from me will be chosen by me only, and will be given to her from my hand. Any attempts to pull another stunt like this WILL be summarily rejected and quite publicly. You do NOT get to decide nor dictate how MY money and generosity gets used.\u201d If this statement doesn\u2019t get your family to back off even a little bit, follow it up with \u201cYou have given me no choice but to reduce or completely cut contact with you.

You\u2019re clearly NTA. Are you going to keep being so nice to sister and niece? poor girl she didn\u2019t do anything but now she expects auntie big bucks to take her to the mouse and keep buying her these extremely generous gifts.

She knew exactly what she was doing when she said she didn't have an idea. \n\nThe trouble with a Disney trip I'd thstvyoud be expected to increase your spending each year to outdo it.

Put a stop to this now before you wind up,paying for,her college too. These are supposed to be gifts, not requisitions.", "NTA this is just psychotic of your sister and the rest of your family don't sound much better. You probably need to go NC for a while at least", "Your sister is going to spin this on you and make sure your niece believes ou recinded your gift. You need to get ahead of that. I'd suggest telling your niece that as she's now a 'big girl', this is your last present, and it's for ONE ticket, hers and hers alone. Once her mum has saved up enough for the hotel and her own ticket, they will have a fabulous time together and you can't wait to see the photos.  Tell your niece her mum misunderstood about you going as well. Sis will never take her, but the niece won't then blame you.\n\nNta.", "Absolutely NTA.  If you do give in then you are a pushover. You need to set clear boundaries and remember this is all your sisters fault, do not leave family guilt you into this!", "Nta \u2026.

Your sister is an Olympic class user and manipulator. I mean, WTF!  And your family are completely blind to the walking atrocity she is. Wtf is wrong with these people. Your sister's behavior is soooooooo far out of line in such an obvious way, I wouldn't even know how to explain how awful this is to them.  Maybe hire some kind of counselor to explain how and why this behavior is so batshi*.\n\nDo not fold. If you give in to this, then you may as well just give her copies of your credit and debit cards.", "Your sister and parents think your niece should get a trip to Disney?  Then they can take her.  And pay for it. They set a trap for you, took advantage of your generosity and are trying to guilt you into doing it.  They should all know better.\n\nIt might be time to set a few boundaries about what you are and are not willing to do when it comes to gifts.

No way.  NTA", ">I would try to find away to have a conversation with your niece. Yes your sister will have to tell her their is no trip, but she will most likely blame it on you and that will impact your relationship with your niece.\n\nThis is a very good idea.", "No. Her sister should've asked if she'd consider it. When she said no, that should be the end of it.", "If you don't set boundaries now, you'll be on the hook for college and her wedding. Time to take a HUGE step back.
