(I make a nice amount and since I have no kids and no partner, I was happy to splurge.)\n\nThe next birthday I got custom stuff from pottery barn. It was this birthday that my sister seemed to latch to the idea that I would go above and beyond every birthday.\n\nThird birthday was a tiny driveable car. Fourth was an American girl doll trip. Fifth was an ipad. I didn\u2019t object to the gift ideas my sister gave, I was happy to spoil my niece. \n\nWell this year for her birthday my sister didn\u2019t tell me what she wanted. I asked a few times but she said she was \u201cin between ideas\u201d When I heard nothing back, I got her a Nintendo switch since I remember her saying she wanted one.\n\nCut to the party last Friday. We\u2019re gathered around watching her open gifts when my sister passes her an envelope. Knowing it wasn\u2019t the gift I brought, I thought nothing of it until she opened it. She gave her mother a look, my sister whispered something, and my niece started screaming. \n\nThe envelope had a picture of Mickey Mouse. My sister had just told her I was taking her to Disney World. \n\nI sat there kinda stunned and expected it to be a joke for a minute. However everyone started to cheer and it became obvious there was no joke. \n\nI tried to meet my sisters eyes but she avoided mine. My niece was starting to pick up on me not being excited so my sister finally looked at me and said \u201cTell her! You get to see the castle!\u201d \n\nIdk the most about Disney but I do know that\u2019s it\u2019s a lot amount more then what I spend on her. \n\nI knew better than to make a scene so I mustered up a smile for my niece and excused myself. \n\nOnce I hit the hallway I turned towards the door. I didn\u2019t want to ruin the day, and the words rushing my mind surely would. I wanted to just make a quiet exit but of course, my sister followed me. She was confused on why I was leaving, and most importantly why I was mad. She kept saying that this was what my niece really wanted and there was no way I would ruin her party by leaving. \n\nI stared. Waiting for her to realize how insane of an ask this was. Her expression remained the same so I simply said \u201cNo I won\u2019t be the one to ruin it. You now get to tell her the trip is simply not happening.\u201d And walked out. \n\nI got a ton of calls from my sister and my parents and after talking, my family thinks I shouldn\u2019t have walked out and worse, most of the family think I should do it. Price aside, as someone who has never travelled solo with a kid, especially in a place like Disney, I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable. \n\nI was okay buying her pricey gifts but this will be well over what I normally spend. I know I didn\u2019t help the problem by agreeing to buy what she asked for but at least to me, a trip should be discussed beforehand. \n\nI\u2019m torn. Since I can afford to should I just do it?

Dont do it. I understand why youre considering it. But what precedent will it set with your sister, if you follow thru with her extravagant promises? Somehow you have to make sure its clear it was never your intention to take her to disney, otherwise your niece will be heartbroken at you. Its not your fault, but your sister needs to take responsibility for this. How unbelievably shitty of her.", "NTA- tell your parents to take her", "NTA - your sister is definite TA for ~~writing~~ forging a check she couldn't cash.

But the part about travel and travelling alone with a kid -- if you have never done that before, that is not just something you shake out of your sleeve. Like... I have a niece and nephew too and they have never spent the night without their parent, much less been alone with me in possibly stressful situations.

Your poor niece. 100% on your sister though.", "Is your sister hoping for a vacation *from* her daughter?

Your sister deliberately set you up to take your niece on a trip that will cost thousands without ever discussing this with you. Her behavior is the epitome of entitled.

I bet she's expecting you to take her as well!\n\nTime to stop buying what your sister suggests and only buying what you want to.  I have two older sisters that don't have kids, and I was thrilled when they chose to spend $30 or $50 on my kids.  I didn't feel I could reciprocate (since they don't have kids), so there were times when they would take my kids for a week (they lived 4 hours away) and I'd give them money towards whatever they did.\n\nMan, I'm so mad at your sister, what a spoiled brat she is!

Your sister is trying to take advantage of you and purposely announced things that way to FORCE you into doing something you didn\u2019t agree to.
