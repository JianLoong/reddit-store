I understand you were asking whether it's healthy/safe to drink breastmilk produced by someone not related to you.

Of course human milk is safe for humans to drink.", "YTA. I think if you don\u2019t recognize how invasive that question is you may need to talk to a therapist/social worker who specializes in helping people who have deficits in social skills or understanding social norms.

Otherwise, if the parent is fighting off an illness at the time, you\u2019d actually get a supply of their antibodies from the milk, so it could conceivably make you healthier. That\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s so strongly encouraged to breastfeed babies for as much of their infancy as possible.", "I'm kind of tough to rattle... and that question would put me on edge.  Asshole?  Maybe... but definitely WTF were you thinking and how did you not know how creepy and inappropriate that question was?", "YTA. Dude, Google exists.

I probably would have joked with you.

If she is uncomfortable about questions she shouldn\u2019t be talking about it in the break room. It could be taken as harassment, however back to the not discussing it in the break room\n\nI would apologize even if you are NTA. You obviously offended her though you weren\u2019t trying. A simple, I was told that you thought I was making fun of you yesterday. I wasn\u2019t trying to, what you said made me wonder and so I asked. I was trying to learn more about something I don\u2019t have much information on and I can now see how that could be take another way than I intended. I will find a different way to answer any questions in the future.", "NTA for enquiring as you were intrigued and wanted to learn, the YTA part is that you didn\u2019t read the room and worded it soooooo wrong.", "INFO: did you apologize for asking in that way? And if so how did you apologize", "NTA but only because you sound super naive.  You asked what would happen if YOU drank her milk.  Which is creepy AF dude, especially when you remember that it's an actual fetish (not mine but I don't kink shame).  What I think you meant to ask was: what would happen if someone other than the baby consumed breast milk? Is it like blood where the wrong match can be fatal?  The answer is no, it's not (ie wet nursing).  You owe Kate a huge apology", "YTA. What the heck!", "NTA - this comes across to me as more curiosity/making conversation. If you were already talking about breastfeeding then I don\u2019t see how you asking that question was making fun of her but learning more about it.", "NTA - Idk why this would be a weird question. It shouldn\u2019t be a private or unnatural topic anyway - you were wondering whether humans would get sick from drinking another\u2019s milk - id probably just laugh and tell you to educate yaself", "YTA - You never need to talk (even in round about way) about co-workers breasts or in this case their by products.\n\nJust puts her in weird spot and you in potential HR violation.", "NTA\n\nIf Kate didn't want to discuss breastmilk, she shouldn't have brought it up. \n\nKate really wasn't a good person to ask though, unless you're all pediatric doctors or human lactation consultants.\n\nJust because she produces milk, doesn't mean she would know anything about its risks and safeties.", "Nta \nI\u2019ve breastfed two babies, and personally would not have been offended by this. As I read it, you were just curious about how breastfeeding works. I don\u2019t get how this is making fun of her unless you left something out. Talking about wet nurses is also not offensive. Personally I think it should be something that is normalized to talk about. \n\nBodies are crazy and breast milk gets formed to meet the nutrients of the specific baby. But it is not harmful to share - women donate their extra supply for babies of moms that can\u2019t produce enough. If you watch the documentary (un) well on Netflix there\u2019s an episode about weightlifters that but breast milk to drink for its nutrient benefits. People also make soap and bathe their babies in it and a whole bunch of other things.", "YTA.\n\nThis whole conversation is inappropriate.\n\nYou don\u2019t randomly ask someone what would happen if you drank their bodily fluids. Personally, I would prefer if you didn\u2019t ask me something like that even if it isn\u2019t random.\n\nWhile breast milk is food and therefore different from other bodily fluids it\u2019s still being created from someone\u2019s body. That creates both physical and emotional connections to the act of creating milk, something many women struggle with only to then also feel shame for struggling. It\u2019s not shameful but it is personal. \n\nBreastfeeding women are also well aware of how many people fetishize breastfeeding. People harass breastfeeding women all the time and turn it into something sexual. \n\nIn short, your question was not only invasive but likely hit a ton of nerves.\n\nYou then follow this up with a conversation with your coworker about wet nurses, something you both flippantly talk about without understanding any history with the practice. Different cultures have different traditions and legacies when it comes to women nursing other people\u2019s babies, including still being practiced. Not all of those legacies are positive. \n\nHowever, even excluding those connotations, what you did was ask someone about drinking their breast milk and then had conversation in front of that person about how women can be hired to nurse others.\n\nYour coworker likely felt you were judging her because your questions and conversation, from the  outside, make it seem like you find breast feeding to be an strange, antiquated thing that you could wrap your head around.\n\nYou talked about breastfeeding the same way you would talk about using a gramophone. Or, guessing by your age, a fax machine. \n\nThe problem is that this isn\u2019t an antiquated thing, is  actually extremely common, and, most importantly, *it is a choice made by the living person in front of you about their body.*\n\nYour coworker went from thinking you might be prepositioning her to thinking you found her to be a fact you briefly found interesting.\n\nThere are respectful ways to ask about breastfeeding. This wasn\u2019t it.\n\nPlease start thinking before you speak. A little thoughtfulness goes a long way.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you asking questions about someone's breast milk?\n\nMYOB and you'll be fine.", "NTA. You could have stated the question a lot better and perhaps you should explain that to the mother.

Sometimes we blurt out something dumb, it happens. But then we have to apologize for that! \n\nYTA.", "YTA. You need to Google these questions instead of asking your coworkers. You came off as rude, oblivious, and insensitive.", "After it cleared up? Absolutely NOT.\n\nYou did make that seem creepy if anything. That\u2019s a mega \u201cwtf moment\u201d. Aside from that, no. It seems like you were genuinely interested in if there were any cons or pros to it. And another coworker answered your question. \n\nI personally don\u2019t understand how she took it as you making fun of her.", "Its just food. But, it would creep me out of any of my coworkers expressed a desire to drink my breast milk. YTA because time and place and circumstance should be respected.

If the context you've described is true, then you asked a pretty innocent question, with open minded curiosity, and your colleague got the context as they followed up with their thoughts.\n\n It seems like the lady whose breast milk that was discussed might be a bit sensitive to the topic. It might be worth apologising to her as a kindness.", "NTA as a woman who has nursed three kids for more than three years each. \n\nI would have thought that was an interesting question. You didn\u2019t ask if you could suck her boobs and it was a hypothetical question. \n\nTo answer your question. No it would not make you sick or anything.

He kind of likes it.", "YTA.  \n\n\nBreast milk is often called \"white gold\", because it has high value to the baby, but also because it represents a huge amount of work on the part of the mom.  \n\n\nEven though you were only thinking out loud, and trying to understand, your original question comes across as if you actually might try to drink her breast milk, which is creepy and weird.    \n\n\nBreastfeeding and breast pumping are both fairly personal activities, and Kate understandably doesn't want you talking about it, speculating about it, or giving her any grief about it.  \n\n\nIt would be like loudly speculating about someone's bathroom or sex habits.  Yes, everybody poops.  But we don't talk about it in public.  \n\n\nYou should apologize to Kate, and then never bring it up again.", "I'm going with mild YTA because you sound like you might have been dropped on your head as a child.", "Info: what the actual f is wrong with you that you thought these were appropriate questions to ask AT WORK?", "I'd say NAH\n\nThe way you've described it, you just had an honest question and blurted it out without warning, which shocked your colleague. Your other colleague engaging in the discussion sounds natural as well, but made the first colleague more uncomfortable. \n\nYou should speak to your breastfeeding colleague and apologise for how you asked the question, and explain that it was genuine curiosity. Also offer to not discuss breastfeeding around her again unless she initiates the discussion.", "NTA. The original phrasing was creepy, but your explanation of what you were really trying to ask seems reasonable. She probably thought you were making fun of her because in her mind  the question was too dumb to be earnest. I would apologize to her and say that you weren't trying to make a joke - just accidentally asked a 'dumb question\" due to not knowing anything about breastfeeding.", "The same people who claim breastfeeding should be public and everyone should be okay with it are now saying you can\u2019t ask questions about how it works. To ME breastfeeding is completely normal in all aspects so being asked a question to ME is also normal. Sure apologize for the way you asked the question, it wasn\u2019t your intention to make her feel weird or like you\u2019re making fun, but I\u2019m completely confused about how asking something like that is wrong. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for asking the question, even though it was presented wrong, and I don\u2019t think your coworker who spoke about wet nurses is an asshole either. I would definitely steer clear of asking Kate more questions as she doesn\u2019t seem comfortable answering. Let her talk and ask someone else next time.", "Bro are you dense? Ofcourse YTA. Who the fuck asks questions like that? Have you been living in a basement that u find it difficult not to vocalize all your thoughts? Jfc", "NTA. bruh moment for sure.

Yes it's a weird question but I don't see why she thought you were making fun of her. \n\nAnd body builders drink breastmilk all the time. Not all of them but some definitely do.

It's healthier than drinking cows milk.", "NTA But maybe a little socially awkward!", "If Kate is not a good friend, then you engaged in some light-hearted workplace sexual harassment. I mean, you engaged in light-hearted workplace sexual harassment, the question is if Kate is a good enough friend to let it go and forgive you for being an idiot. YTA.\n\nEdit: I don't know why I'm clarifying this. But I hope you know breasts are looked at sexually in most societies. And in all fairness there is reason to believe there are biological reasons for breasts to be associated with sex. When everything about breasts is associated with sex then I hope you're not too surprised that people in this world have breastfeeding kinks. You'd have to be extremely naive summer child to not have guessed that is something that happens. An adult drinking breastmilk is associated with sexual kinks because there is no reason otherwise. Kate would feel extremely uncomfortable being told you want to use her baby's nutrition in a kinky activity. Hell, it doesn't have to be breast milk, any comment about drinking any bodily fluid while completely harmless would be creepy as hell. Sweat, saliva, boogers. Just what were you thinking.", "Nta: because you asked an intrusive thought and didnt recognize the question being a weird question makes you lack understanding.

However, you should apologize to her.", "To be honest, you completely sunk the conversation with your introduction. There's no way to recover from \"what would happen if I drank your breast milk?\".\n\nIt seems like you maybe had a genuine question about whether it was safe for babies other than the mother's personal baby to drink her breast milk (best keep the question to babies. Adults drinking breast milk tends to be a sexual perversion, and that makes it very much inappropriate for a work conversation.) And if you had phrased the question that way, you'd have been fine. And Lauren's answer was correct - wet nurses have been a thing, and there's no general biological incompatibility between one mother and another mother's baby,\n\nIt's generally not recommended because of the risk of passing on disease (you don't know if the other mother has something that you can catch via breast milk), but other than that risk, there isn't a problem.\n\nBut you chose to introduce your personal self in to the question, and cast yourself in the role of pervert. You can't recover from that. You need to stop digging!\n\nAnd because of that, YTA.\n\n(Breastfeeding is an intimate sharing between mother and child, and individual mothers will have different levels of comfort with them feeding another child, or their child feeding from another woman. I know some women who more or less interchangeably fed each other's babies (one would babysit, and if the guest baby was hungry, she would feed them), and other women who would be horrified by the suggestion that another woman could feed their child. Whether it is medically safe, and whether the mothers concerned would be OK with it, are completely different questions.)", "NTA. Some serious snowflakes on here", "YTA How old are you?

It won't hurt you.  Mother's milk is live cells though, it contains all the stuff to help the infant grow and fight off illness that is going around.
