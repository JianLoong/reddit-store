My (29F) friend, Sarah (27F), has turned into an absolute bridezilla, and her wedding planning has been nothing short of chaos.\r  \n\r  \nSarah has always had a strong personality, but since getting engaged, her behavior has become increasingly erratic. She announced that her wedding would be a grand fairy tale, complete with a lavish ball gown for all the bridesmaids. The problem was that the dresses she picked were way over the top and made us look like walking caricatures.\r  \n\r  \nI tried to talk to Sarah about how uncomfortable and impractical the dresses were, but every time I raised a concern, she would throw a tantrum. She accused me of not supporting her special day and threatened to uninvite me from the wedding. It was impossible to reason with her when she was in that state.\r  \n\r  \nAs the wedding planning continued, Sarah's demands became more outrageous. She changed her mind about the theme multiple times, making it nearly impossible to keep up with her ever-changing vision. One minute, it was a fairy tale, and the next, it was a tropical luau.\r  \n\r  \nShe would snap at her bridesmaids over the smallest details, and we all felt like walking on eggshells around her. It was no longer about celebrating her love but more like appeasing her tantrums.\r  \n\r  \nOne day, she had a complete meltdown because the flower arrangements weren't the exact shade of pink she wanted. She yelled at her family, the wedding planner, and even the florist. It was an embarrassing scene that left everyone feeling uncomfortable.\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't bear the thought of wearing that ridiculous ball gown and becoming part of her wedding circus. So, I decided to be honest with her once more, explaining that her behavior and demands were becoming too much for me to handle.\r  \n\r  \nBut instead of understanding, she erupted into another tantrum, screaming that I was a terrible friend and that I was ruining her wedding. She threatened to cut ties with me and said she would never forgive me for not supporting her dream day.\r  \n\r  \nIt hurt me deeply that she was willing to throw away our friendship over a dress. It was clear that her wedding had become more about her ego and less about celebrating love with her friends and family.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, I made the difficult decision not to be a bridesmaid in Sarah's wedding. I knew it would cause more drama, but I couldn't compromise my self-respect for her unreasonable demands and tantrums.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I'm feeling torn and upset. Should I have just swallowed my pride and gone along with her outrageous demands to keep the peace?", "created_utc": 1690748075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dv6fq/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_themed_dress_to_my/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

By refusing to wear the dress, I may have come across as unsupportive and uncooperative, potentially hurting the bride's feelings and causing unnecessary tension and conflict during her special day. It could be seen as prioritizing my own comfort and preferences over the bride's desires, which might be considered selfish and inconsiderate in the context of a wedding.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It is weird that you think your opinion of her wedding aesthetic matters more than hers and if she only had people like you constantly shitting all over her choices and preferences and trying to make it all about them rather than helping their friend make a day that was all about her the experience she hoped for by supporting them maybe that\u2019s why she was losing her cool. Part of being in a wedding is agreeing to a look the bride is going for. There\u2019s a reason why there is a long lore of hideous bridesmaid dresses. The fact that you say \u201cevery time\u201d you brought it up makes it clear that you just weren\u2019t the right friend to have in her wedding party. It sounds like you were never \u201ccelebrating your love\u201d because you were too busy criticizing her planning because it wasn\u2019t what you wanted for yourself.", "NTA.  It sounds less like it was a problem with the theme (although, eww) and more that there wasn\u2019t a concrete plan, her attitude was less than favorable, and if she wants to use expelling members of her wedding party as a threat, you are nta for pulling out voluntarily.", "OMG no.

That said, bride has no right to be rude and a jerk to her family/friends/etc. However, it\u2019s pretty standard that bridesmaids outfits are relatively ugly and virtually useless after, whether themed or just a color you don\u2019t ever wear. As a bridesmaid, if money isn\u2019t an issue, then I wouldve just sucked it up to wear the ugly dress and have a backup outfit for the reception if it was uncomfortable to wear. Sure it\u2019s ugly, but you\u2019re not the only one in it and it\u2019d make your friend feel loved and supported. If you don\u2019t wish to be her friend though because of her recent behavior, that\u2019s one thing. But 1) weddings are hell honestly and every decision a bride makes feels like it has to be meaningful and supported tbh, and 2) it\u2019s just one day of an ugly dress.

Suck it up, and get through whatever is left of the wedding planning/wedding in one piece (if possible) and then end the friendship \n\n2.
