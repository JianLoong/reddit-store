My (29F) friend, Sarah (27F), has turned into an absolute bridezilla, and her wedding planning has been nothing short of chaos.\r  \n\r  \nSarah has always had a strong personality, but since getting engaged, her behavior has become increasingly erratic. She announced that her wedding would be a grand fairy tale, complete with a lavish ball gown for all the bridesmaids. The problem was that the dresses she picked were way over the top and made us look like walking caricatures.\r  \n\r  \nI tried to talk to Sarah about how uncomfortable and impractical the dresses were, but every time I raised a concern, she would throw a tantrum. She accused me of not supporting her special day and threatened to uninvite me from the wedding. It was impossible to reason with her when she was in that state.\r  \n\r  \nAs the wedding planning continued, Sarah's demands became more outrageous. She changed her mind about the theme multiple times, making it nearly impossible to keep up with her ever-changing vision. One minute, it was a fairy tale, and the next, it was a tropical luau.\r  \n\r  \nShe would snap at her bridesmaids over the smallest details, and we all felt like walking on eggshells around her. It was no longer about celebrating her love but more like appeasing her tantrums.\r  \n\r  \nOne day, she had a complete meltdown because the flower arrangements weren't the exact shade of pink she wanted. She yelled at her family, the wedding planner, and even the florist. It was an embarrassing scene that left everyone feeling uncomfortable.\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't bear the thought of wearing that ridiculous ball gown and becoming part of her wedding circus. So, I decided to be honest with her once more, explaining that her behavior and demands were becoming too much for me to handle.\r  \n\r  \nBut instead of understanding, she erupted into another tantrum, screaming that I was a terrible friend and that I was ruining her wedding. She threatened to cut ties with me and said she would never forgive me for not supporting her dream day.\r  \n\r  \nIt hurt me deeply that she was willing to throw away our friendship over a dress. It was clear that her wedding had become more about her ego and less about celebrating love with her friends and family.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, I made the difficult decision not to be a bridesmaid in Sarah's wedding. I knew it would cause more drama, but I couldn't compromise my self-respect for her unreasonable demands and tantrums.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I'm feeling torn and upset. Should I have just swallowed my pride and gone along with her outrageous demands to keep the peace?", "created_utc": 1690748075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dv6fq/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_themed_dress_to_my/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

By refusing to wear the dress, I may have come across as unsupportive and uncooperative, potentially hurting the bride's feelings and causing unnecessary tension and conflict during her special day. It could be seen as prioritizing my own comfort and preferences over the bride's desires, which might be considered selfish and inconsiderate in the context of a wedding.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I hope someone tells her how unreasonable she is.", "NTA I think what you may be experiencing is something more like grief. I've had to cut off many close loved ones for various reasons like addictions and unchecked mental illness and that feeling remains for a while. Its the loss of the friendship or what you thought the friemdship was. You need to decide if you're willing to put up with the behavior or not. If not you need to stand firm. She will most likely not change for the wedding and will continue to spiral. It's your choice whether you want a relationship like that in your life but it's definitely not healthy or acceptable behavior. You can always go LC too.", "NTA. Nope, nope, nope. Her vision has caused her to become myopic.  If your pulling out of the role doesn't cause her to think about her recent actions and come to her senses, there is not much more you can do.", "You're NTA.

I understand the stress of a wedding but\u2026. you stuck by her side with all of the changes + tantrums and she has the audacity to call you a terrible friend and throw the friendship away? I believe Sarah needs a deeper look at herself in the mirror for treating you and the bridesmaids like props. You made the right call to not be there.", "NTA\n\nYou have now declined to be a participant in her production, so you can sit back and enjoy the show from the seats. \n\nOr not.
