I knew Saul was a vegetarian and my ex became one as well about a year into dating him. Still, she would cook meat for the boys. Once Saul moved in after the wedding, he said he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with any meat in the house at all. I didn\u2019t see much issue with this at first. Their home, they can do as they please. All I care about are my boys being fed and remaining healthy, which they are.\n\nThen my ex became upset that our sons are not following a vegetarian diet. At her house, they have no choice, really. But my wife and I serve a variety of foods. There\u2019s not meat every night, but at least 3-4 times a week, you can guarantee a dish will include it. If the boys stated they wanted to become vegetarians, I would respect it and find a way to make sure they were maintaining a healthy diet. However, neither of them want to be.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that at my ex\u2019s, they complain that they can\u2019t eat meat. Even if they go out, my ex and Saul will only let them order vegetarian items. In the beginning, I did try to explain different houses have different rules but eventually just let them vent. I also told my ex that this is her circus to handle, because she and Saul are making the rule.\nLast week was my birthday, so my wife took me and the boys to my favorite steakhouse. They went back to their mom\u2019s on Sunday afternoon. She sent me a long rant text stating that the boys were requesting burgers and when she said no, they said \u201cbut dad let us have steak last week\u201d. She asked that I stopped serving meat in my house and letting them order it at restaurants. I said I wasn\u2019t going to do that unless they told me that they wanted to follow a vegetarian diet. She claims that I am making her job harder. When I told her that she\u2019s making her own job harder, she got mad and called me an asshole.\n\nThe people I\u2019ve spoken to are split. All agree that I should be able to feed my kids whatever (within reason) but some feel I should try to make my ex\u2019s life easier.

They get double the experience that way, BUT ONLY if they are respectful of moms rules while at moms house.  \n\n\nReframe the whole thing as a positive, and establish that dad giving them meat isn't dad fighting mom (Which prompts the kids to pick a side).
