We split time 50/50, they\u2019re with me 2 weeks a month, then with her the other 2. A couple of years ago, she began dating this guy \u201cSaul\u201d and they got married a few months back. I knew Saul was a vegetarian and my ex became one as well about a year into dating him. Still, she would cook meat for the boys. Once Saul moved in after the wedding, he said he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with any meat in the house at all. I didn\u2019t see much issue with this at first. Their home, they can do as they please. All I care about are my boys being fed and remaining healthy, which they are.\n\nThen my ex became upset that our sons are not following a vegetarian diet. At her house, they have no choice, really. But my wife and I serve a variety of foods. There\u2019s not meat every night, but at least 3-4 times a week, you can guarantee a dish will include it. If the boys stated they wanted to become vegetarians, I would respect it and find a way to make sure they were maintaining a healthy diet. However, neither of them want to be.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that at my ex\u2019s, they complain that they can\u2019t eat meat. Even if they go out, my ex and Saul will only let them order vegetarian items. In the beginning, I did try to explain different houses have different rules but eventually just let them vent. I also told my ex that this is her circus to handle, because she and Saul are making the rule.\nLast week was my birthday, so my wife took me and the boys to my favorite steakhouse. They went back to their mom\u2019s on Sunday afternoon. She sent me a long rant text stating that the boys were requesting burgers and when she said no, they said \u201cbut dad let us have steak last week\u201d. She asked that I stopped serving meat in my house and letting them order it at restaurants. I said I wasn\u2019t going to do that unless they told me that they wanted to follow a vegetarian diet. She claims that I am making her job harder. When I told her that she\u2019s making her own job harder, she got mad and called me an asshole.\n\nThe people I\u2019ve spoken to are split. All agree that I should be able to feed my kids whatever (within reason) but some feel I should try to make my ex\u2019s life easier.

I would never expect others not to eat meat if they want to.  \nIf someone ask ill happily discuss why i dont eat meat but i dont want to impose my opinon on others if they dont ask for it.  \nWhat im getting at is that its perfectly fine for your ex and her hubby to be vegetarian and eat vegetarian at home, even serve your kids vegetarian foods but they shouldnt try to force you to become one, or your kids for that matter.", "NTA As a vegan, I think the best way to make your kids eat nothing but burgers for the rest of their is to try to force them into a meatless diet.

I don't think a court system would consider not paying for meat entrees abuse. \n\nHowever, what this is setting Mom up for is looking like the bad guy to her kids, and THAT is what she is mad about. Kids like meat, Dad allows meat-eating while Mom/Saul do not. Honestly, if what they want is the kids to be vegetarian of their own volition, this is not the way to go about it at all.
