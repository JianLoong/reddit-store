I did forget to mention that the teachers pet is the favourite for all teachers because the studio owner is her god mother.

They deal with enough outside of class. \n\nBeing fat phobic sadly has been in the dance world for decades and is only now starting to change. That was uncalled for. Dance is excellent form of exercise, self confidence and strength. I would have told said teacher to get bent back in my day. \n\nYour former teacher sounds like they were of the \u201cold school\u201d thought process where all of us girls had to be under a certain height and weight which I cannot even begin to describe to you the amount of damage that caused. \n\nDance, of any kind, should be fun! Whether it\u2019s your career path or not. The dance master or mistress if they feel a student warrants extra attention should be doing private lessons so as not to disrupt a class. Favourites is unfortunately still a problem but that is also changing to give everyone a fair shake at doing their best.\n\nI repeat you did nothing wrong. Standing up for others is fine thing and when I was still dancing/teaching I would have been proud to have you as my student! \n\n\nIgnore the others and while you\u2019re at it I would another chat with you studio owner about this because it\u2019s creating a hostile environment.\n\n*edited for a word", "NTA and good for you.
