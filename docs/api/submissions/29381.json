He had a new girlfriend Amy (28F) right off the bat. Amy lived in another country, but at some point she moved here to live with John. I have zero problem with her being from abroad, and from everything I\u2019ve heard about her she seems like a nice person. I heard they got married at some point lately.\r  \n\r  \nWe have shared custody of our daughter Ella (11F) and she stays with me every other week and John every other week. Eventually I started asking John for me to meet his new girlfriend. John has told me what she does for living and some things like that, and Ella sometimes mentions her. I know she\u2019s a decent person and I\u2019m not worried about anything. I would be fine with just having a cup of coffee once with Amy and John and chatting for 15 minutes to get to know one another a little. I think I have the right to know at some level what kind of person my child lives with. I also think it would be good for Ella to see the adults in her life getting along. I would\u2019ve liked that when my parents divorced. John has avoided arranging us meeting for years. Most of the time he says they\u2019re so busy, every time I ask it\u2019s a bad timing. We live in the same city. About a year ago we had agreed a date we would meet, but I had a sudden car problem and had to cancel. After that John told me he doesn\u2019t feel good about me and Amy meeting, that it feels like an interrogation. That\u2019s not my intention. I get that it will be a bit awkward. But it would be for Ella\u2019s sake. I wouldn\u2019t mind getting together for Ella\u2019s birthday etc., but if they don\u2019t want to do that it\u2019s ok. John\u2019s always been a private person and I can respect that. I don\u2019t want to overstep boundaries. But I think this is someting people do when co-parenting.\r  \n\r  \nI don\u2019t know why he is so firmly against us meeting. I\u2019m not an impulsive or aggressive person, I don\u2019t have a history of starting unnecessary drama. He says he just doesn\u2019t think us meeting is necessary. I\u2019ve explained why this is important to me. I don\u2019t also feel like it\u2019s my place to contact Amy directly. John has had a tendency to bend the truth a bit here and there (e.g. him an Amy probably were in contact well before our divorce). I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something he doesn\u2019t want to come up if we meet. I honestly don\u2019t care, whatever it might be. I\u2019ve dealt with the past and have no interest in any drama. I just want to make thing work the best for Ella.\r  \n\r  \nI have a great new relationship. My boyfriend (38M) lives with me now. He has a son who lives with us every other weekend. The son\u2019s mom wanted to meet me when we first started dating and I agreed. It was awkward. But I respect and understand that she needed that as a mother. I\u2019ve asked if John would like to meet Sam, and he doesn\u2019t want to. They\u2019ve met a couple of times briefly during Ella\u2019s pick ups.\r  \n\r  \nSo am I being unreasonable for wanting to meet my ex husbands new wife that lives with my daughter half of the time?", "created_utc": 1697878632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cy9fn/aita_for_wanting_to_meet_my_ex_husbands_new_wife/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes exes do this because they have lied about what happened and don\u2019t want to get caught out.", "Nta John seems extremely unreasonable. It is perfectly normal and logical to meet your ex\u2019s spouse. Your child should see a healthy relationship between you and your ex along with his current spouse. You should all be going to school events, sporting events, etc.", "NTA and I think this is totally normal.  I dated someone with children and I met his ex wife before I even met his kids, right as things were starting to get serious.  She ended up being such a lovely person.\n\nIs there a way you can arrange to meet Amy at pickups?  I think it's imperative you know who your child is living with.  Also, what if John isn't around and there is an emergency?  You two need to be able to communicate.", "NTA. Very reasonable to want to meet her. She\u2019s going to be a big part of your daughters life, so that makes sense. Sounds like your ex has something to hide? Maybe make it clear you don\u2019t care if they\u2019ve been together before the divorce etc.", "NTA but if ex is dead set against it notice you can do but just ask your daughter if she likes step mum and step mum treats her well.

I certainly wouldn\u2019t have been as a dad.", "It sounds to me like your ex is being unreasonable. You have every right to know the person whom your daughter lives with 50 percent of the time.", "NTA Of course you want to meet a woman your child will be spending a lot of time with.\n\nJohn doesn't want her to meet you because he's told her a lot of lies about what an unreasonable demon harpie you are.", "NTA.  \n\n\nJohn is definitely hiding something about their relationship from you, and wants to be sure it never comes to life.", "NTA . I think it's weird how against it he is. I think he is worried what might come out in a conversation.", "NTA you are being completely reasonable. The sweetest parenting I ever saw was at work.  Both moms and dads were at the hospital for their child\u2019s tonsillectomy.  On the way out of the hospital both Moms were walking out together chatting like best buddies to coordinate taking care of their daughter during her recovery. I felt like she was such a lucky child to have that much support.", "NTA. Where I am, it's not actually unusual for it to be witten into divorce decrees that parents get to meet other parent's new partners. It's not a big deal, except that he's making it weird for some reason.", "NTA. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to want to meet your child\u2019s step mom. What is your ex hiding? Maybe he is lying to his new wife?", "NTA\u2026sorry, but I cannot believe all the YTAs here.  What parent in their right mind does not want to meet any other adult in their child\u2019s life as much as your exs new wife will be?   The only reason you are being pushy is because of your ex.  What exactly is he trying to hide? And why?  I would not even ask him anymore.  I would show up at their door, preferably when he is at work, introduce myself and just say that you wanted to meet the person who has become important in your child\u2019s life and get to know them in case you ever have to talk to each other regarding said child.  Let the chips fall from there.", "NAH- I think it's reasonable that you would want to meet her.

I don't know why your ex has a problem with it, but try not to worry. From all reports you've had she seems like a decent person, and most likely you'd have heard from Ella by now if that wasn't the case.", "NTA the time line is a bit dodgy I bet she was an ap and didn\u2019t know so meeting you your ex will be found out.", "Honestly I think you are being a responsible Mother, if my child was living with someone 50% of the time I would want to meet them too.

You cannot ask for that. If he\u2019s an unfit father then sue for full custody. If he\u2019s a fit father trust him to have his daughters interests in mind when picking his new spouse. It\u2019s been years, Ella is happy and content, there\u2019s zero NEED for you to meet. To keep pushing for it (and it sounds like you have asked a lot of time over the years), to make it about Ella (when she doesn\u2019t seem to care, so is it your own curiosity or sense of self?), \u2026 is a bit of an AH move. But not a hard AH, let\u2019s go with soft AH.", "At this point YTA. You need to drop it now.\n\nYou just have to accept John's no as an answer and accept that he has a sound judgement in who he married is a good person and good to your daughter.\n\nFurther explaining my stance, one meeting with Amy would change nothing but seem like a bit of a control move and quench your curiosity. That's it. Because all you've heard about Amy are just good things. You wouldn't be able to judge her character over 1 meeting. And it's curious, that you think something might come up if you meet, if you have no intention but to meet up over coffee.", "NTA\n\nIt's completely unreasonable for someone who is at least occasionally watching your child to not meet you. Is there some reason you can't just reach out to her?", "NTA - I think your request is very reasonable, he is also not unreasonable to say no.\n\nEverything you have heard gives you the impression that she is a good person, and you have no concerns about her. However seeing is believing, that is all you are asking.\n\nHowever his continued resistance with out an explanation is telling. As a man, I can tell you he has something to hide. Either from you, but more likely from her. I suspect there is something that he has not been completely honest with her about you, and if you were to meet, and form some kind of relationship it may come out. This is going to cause him problems, so he is avoiding it, its that simple. \n\nJust ask him, \"is there something you have not told me, or her you are concerned might come out. We are divorced, it does not matter to me, and I have no desire to cause problems in your relationship\"? I am sure he will lie, but you can read his body language. Good luck to you.", "NTA. It is not unreasonable for you to want to meet someone your daughter lives with half the time and will no doubt be significantly involved in her life. John seems very odd that he\u2019s so against it and also that he doesn\u2019t want to meet your partner, again someone who will be involved your daughters life why wouldn\u2019t you want to know who that person is?", "NTA \n\nNot gonna lie, I would\u2019ve pushed long before now. Why *aren\u2019t* you concerned??? If my ex refused to allow me to MEET the person my child was living with every other week of their life, that would be a huge red flag. Honestly, you don\u2019t seem concerned enough.", "NTA. She\u2019s from out of the country? Can\u2019t meet her? He\u2019s hiding something about her.", "Nta he's hiding something. He probably told her you were awful", "YTA because you keep pushing it.  And it feels like you want to meet to find out information because you think their relationship started before you guys got divorced.  \n\nAlso, because you are soooo insistent that you don\u2019t want to start drama makes me feel like it is highly likely you will.", "YTA, nobody is obligated to meet you and you have no \"right\" to it either. You need to drop it.", "At this point yes, yta. You've admitted you know a little about her already and that she sounds like a nice person. If anything you pushing like this is probably what's causing the reluctance. Back off and see what happens.", "Definitely NTA. It\u2019s totally reasonable to want to meet her, but most importantly it\u2019s a good thing for your child to know that there is a healthy relationship between you three.", "YTA.

There has been no indication from your child as to any problems, and you have made it about you and protecting your own sense of security. Your ex doesnt need you to be judging his new wife, which is all this is\u2026its like you are interviewing her or something to see if she is fit for the job. What if she is different than what you expected (say she has a bunch of piercings and face tattoos that may not be your cup of tea\u2026would you be OK with that? And if not, what would you be able to do about it besides causing a problem, just to make yourself feel better?)\n\nYou come across as being high and mighty and extremely judgemental as to who is or is not appropriate to be in your daughter\u2019s life.

It was awkward and a little uncomfortable, but it needed to be done because I needed to be sure that my children were safe and being well taken care of.", "NTA I think you should reach out to her yourself.", "What do you expect to learn in a short meeting? I get the desire to get a sense of who she is since she's around your kid so much, but an awkward conversation over a cup of coffee isn't really going to tell you much. \n\nThe ongoing resistance to the meeting tho, that says plenty.", "YTA You need to get your desire to have control under control. Your ex is as every bit a parent as your daughter. Which means he can choose who his daughter is around as much as he wants without your input during his time.\n\nThere are no issue of safety or mistreatment concerns at play here so butt out. Try exploring why you are being so controlling in therapy. Focus on that. Focus on better a better mom and girlfriend. Get a hobby. But butt out of your ex\u2019 s life.", "NTA This was a condition of our custody agreement when we split", "NTA, I wouldn't want my child to be around someone I don't know.", "NTA for wanting to meet her. It's logical, though not necessary, because you've already said you're sure she's a good person, and even that you're both equal parents, he is able to bring whatever women into your daughter's life he wishes to (he can bring whatever people into her life he wishes, as can you). He's not wrong that it's not necessary, but it is nice and it can be helpful and if you can all get along it makes things like birthdays, graduations and wedding(s) easier later because everyone can get along nicely rather than being snippy. If he won't play ball, it's not worth pushing it, just be civil any time you do come across her, but maybe accept he's not going to go out of his way to make it happen because it's not something he thinks is important.", "NTA.

Would you be OK with this? Not likely, because human nature is to care more about what\u2019s important to you more than maybe a different interest that your kid picks up from their ex\u2019s new man.

Coz if it was so OP would have mentioned it. So from the co-parenting front all seems to be fine. \n\nIt's not like OPs request was completely denied. They had set up a meet and she dint make it. It's also possible that the ex is trying to avoid it because OP is pushing so hard for it. Maybe it's making him uncomfortably coz while OP says it's for the sake of the child it's possible for conversations about their past to come up and he doesn't want to open a can of worms. In OPs own words she is in a good relationship and so is he. \n\nIt's not wrong for OP to want to meet Amy but pushing it seems unnecessary given the daughter is doing fine.", "I think it's more appropriate to handle this between parents. I don't want to walk over John with this and go straight to Amy, that would cause a lot of anger for his part and I'd like to keep things civil.

I have directly said to him that if there's something that he fears might come up, it really really doesn't matter to me. I have no need to dig the past or get upset about something he might have not told me. I also have no need to try to hurt his current relationship.

And she certainly has a right to meet the person living with her kid.", "Yeah, this isn't about wanting to judge anyone. Just trying to be a responsible parent and make my daughter feel content and safe knowing that all the adults in her life know each other on some level, get along and take care of her together. I don't know if I stressed it enough in my post, but I am by no means trying to veto their relationship or have any say in their lives. I have zero need to \"do something\" even if I wouldn't like her, which I don't think will happen. This is about co-parenting. I wouldn't feel any need whatsoever to meet her if we didn't have a kid whose life she is involved in.", "I think it's appropriate to handle this between the parents. Reaching out to her would cause drama, which I don't want.", "Ehh, honestly I don\u2019t think the meeting matters. Even if it was at drop off and it was just a quick round of pleasantries. This woman is most likely going to be in her child\u2019s life for a long time. There shouldn\u2019t be an issue with meeting up.\n\nIf I was a parent, I think I\u2019d be pretty insistent too. That because I felt like I needed to, but that I would truthfully just want to see the kind of person is with my daughter on a day to day basis.", "I tried to make meeting me as easy and as possible for them, and less intimidating by suggesting a short casual meeting.", "I find her ongoing insistence interesting. It comes across as her wanting to get a feel for her replacement.", "I have very much butted out of John's life. But I haven't butted out of my daughter's life, and Amy has become a part of Ella's life.\n\nYou think I'm controlling - would you then say John is not?", "Amy might be someone you know", "After reading your comment I think that Amy is someone you know and that's why he doesn't want you to meet her.", "INFO: Does she never come to Ella's school events (back to school night, sports games, recitals, whatever)? Seems like an organic way to meet would be at a school thing for Ella--which you should all be attending.", "It must be something with his new girlfriend then. I knew a guy who cheated on his pregnant wife of 15 years with a younger woman from his work. Apparently he told his side piece that she was emotionally abusive towards him, making him sleep on the sofa, saying she doesn\u2019t treat him well.\n\nCould be something similar where he\u2019s lied about his relationship with you to get with her and he doesn\u2019t want her finding out. \n\nIn which case you should definitely keep pushing to meet her!", "If you\u2019re truly ok with that, please don\u2019t ever have children because that\u2019s an absolutely unacceptable attitude for any parent.", "But then again, she chose to marry a man who has a child and she is now a part of the kid's life. One would think she'd anticipate a situation like this just might come up. It usually does, as this is normal co-parenting thing in my book. But I don't know for sure who's the reluctant one with them, and that's again a thing that is not my business to even know. Outcome is the same.", "You\u2019re not divorced are you? We don\u2019t get to decide or control what happens when they are with their other parent as long as they are safe. It\u2019s sucks but the ex said no.", "Yeah, I know it might come off as pushy. But this is important to me and he knows it. I've dropped the subject for months at a time during there years to give them space. It's funny how this has become a problem about me being pushy, when his rejection to a thing I think is not a big deal, is the cause I need to keep asking. Ella is doing fine and I would be far more pushy if I would suspect there's something to worry about. But I don't.", "The problem is that he is refusing to let you meet. I'm not  sure how you can meet her if  he refuses to  facilitate that meeting.", "\"Hide\" may be too strong of a word, but clearly he is concerned about something with you meeting.", "Honestly? With the way this post is phrased I get the feeling they probably have crossed paths at pick up etc. What it sounds like OP wants is a sit down girl chat, and I don't think that's needed necessarily.", "And ending with that bit about being in a great new relationship makes me think maybe she's jealous of new wifey etc.", "Your ex doesn\u2019t want to, enough said! He said no, so its no. You do NOT have a \u201cright\u201d. If you feel you do, call your family law attorney and pay to try and get them involved. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear your ex doesn\u2019t want you in his life at all. Get the hint", "It\u2019s been years. It\u2019s not happening if it\u2019s up to John. At this point, you\u2019ll meet her at a graduation or your daughter\u2019s wedding", "I know her name and she is not someone I know.", "No. But then pretty much neither does John. I agree, that would be a good way to meet.", "I have a son and yes OP is AH. And those who think it\u2019s ok to meddle with her ex is horrible.", "I have no need to be able decide or control anything in their lives. I have no illusion that I would be in a place to have any control over them, nor would I even want to do that. What is to be gained? I think meeting with your child's new step parent even once is a normal thing to do while trying to do a good job co-parenting. I didn't think this would grow up to be a question about control. Might this be what he thinks it is, me making a power move, and says no to meeting?", "What if she doesn\u2019t want to meet?", "Nope. I have not once seen her in a pick up situation. I've seen her a couple times from the distance in a store/mall, and I wouldn't have known that was Amy without her being there with John. At those instances I thought it would be kinda weird and give crazy ex vibes for me to run after them and introduce myself, and that I would meet her properly later on when John felt ready for it. Now if I'd see them somewhere I would absolutely take the chance to meet her so no one has to stress about this anymore.", "Ahh, I can understand that then. If that\u2019s the case then I definitely don\u2019t think there\u2019s a relative need for them to meet.\n\nOp might also be trying to sneak in a \u201cso when did you two meet?\u201d Question to see if her suspicions (that she brought up in the post) of her ex husband cheating are valid.\n\nBut yeah, I can see your point, and if that\u2019s the case then I agree, no need.", "It\u2019s not about meddling. I ask you if you split up and you had 50/50 custody wouldn\u2019t you want to meet the person that your partner moved into their house as they were then going to be a big part of your sons life. I would and it would work both ways I would expect my ex to meet my partner if I moved in someone else.", "That\u2019s not meddling, do you even know what that word means? It\u2019s bizarre that a parent would move a new spouse into the home & refuse to let the coparent meet them. If they had a terrible relationship with supervised exchanges or something that would be different but he\u2019s hiding something & whatever it is could be dangerous to the child.", "Wouldn't  you think he would have mentioned that by now? Regardless, she's watching over OP's kid. OP deserves to meet her.", "There's also the contradiction here:\n\nJohn has told me what she does for living and some things like that, and Ella sometimes mentions her. **I know she\u2019s a decent person and I\u2019m not worried about anything.** I would be fine with just having a cup of coffee once with Amy and John and chatting for 15 minutes to get to know one another a little. **I think I have the right to know at some level what kind of person my child lives with.**\n\nShe knows she's a decent person, but that disappears because she has right to know \"what kind of person\" her child lives with? OP sounds like the overbearing Ex.", "I have no plans to ask her that or anything else about their relationship. That's none of my business. My current bf's ex actually asked me some questions about where and when did we meet with my bf, and I found it a bit strange. I wouldn't have wanted to discuss that with her, even though they have split up many years ago so there's no implications, and I bet she was trying to think of something to talk about. I don't want to make Amy or John feel uncomfortable in the same way. I would like to talk about Ella (they have some common interests with Amy, like shoes) and get to know Amy a bit in the surface level, and of course getting to know each other goes both ways if she has something she would like to ask me.", "No. I would trust that my ex would have my sons interest in mind the same that he would trust me if have some else be part of my life. Insisting I meet his new partner is meddling. It\u2019s obscene to even think about it. If he offers for us to meet then that\u2019s different.", "I think saying she doesn\u2019t want to meet her might make it worse. He may be more comfortable taking the \u201cblame\u201d so to speak.", "Oh well. She still needs to meet her."]}
