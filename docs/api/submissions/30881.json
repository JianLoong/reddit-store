My parents don't work, they both are disabled and are unable to. The request said it was something that the kids wanted, but when I asked my kids about it today because I didn't know they had access to a phone.

Apparently they were given phones at some point. My parents phone numbers were programmed in, but my phone number wasn't programmed in and I wasn't told that they had phones either. I talked to them about the dangers of randomly requesting money and explained that if they wanted to do anything for their mom to come to me that way we can figure something out. It's weird because my ex went our entire 7 years and hated my parents they never talked. To this day my mom isn't allowed to pick my children up from school because of my ex fighting so hard against it in my parenting plan.", "created_utc": 1699835729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tydcq/wibtah_if_i_ask_my_kids_not_to_ask_my_parents_for/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids can't set up a cash app account, meaning there has to be an adult behind it. Also, no 8 year old asks for *three hundred dollars* for their moms birthday present. To an 8 year old, $20 is enough for everything. \n\nTell *your parents* to ignore any future requests. Help your kids pick out something small or do something homemade for mom's birthday.\n\nNTA", "NTA but word it correctly. \n\nI think it\u2019s great that they want to get their mom something. They need some kind of allowance, otherwise it\u2019s usually the other parent that takes them out to get something. Give your kids guidance on how they should handle this situation in the future.", "YWNBTA -  It's great that the kids want to get their mom something for her birthday, but hitting up grandma and grandpa for money isn't the way to go about it. \n\nCashapp in general isn't the way to approach it. I think if you explain to them that your parents aren't able to help with stuff like that they should understand. \n\nAlso that is a lot of money for a gift from some kids. I don't want to make assumptions, the kids are young enough that they may just not understand how much money that really is, but it seems like there is a chance this is spurred on by the mother, in which case that's a major issue that you will need to deal with.", "Not at all! Your children need to understand boundaries. Your phone is one of them. Explain you can help them get her a small gift, or even help them make a gift for her. \nMoney should not be their problem or discussed around them. They should remain innocent and happy. Explain that grandma isn\u2019t going to just give out money either , and possibly use this time as a learning lesson. Money comes from hard work, not from family.", "Maybe take your kids shopping for a present for her from them.  You can put a price limit, give each kid the same amount and help them shop.  Same with Christmas.", "NTA.\n\nYour kids need to learn that you do not ask people for money--especially such a huge amount of money--and that you're sure their mother would be delighted if they drew her a picture and picked her some flowers.\n\nAnd then get your lawyer to send her lawyer a strongly worded letter dissuading this type of behaviour. Also, start keeping a diary of these things for future court appearances.", "NTA.  The easy way to do it is to say \"your grandparents don't have money so we can't ask them.  Come to me if you need or want money for anything.  They're going to deny the request\".", "NTA. If it was your kids that actually sent the request, they need to learn that just sending a money request on venmo is not okay or the right way to get money from people. I mean, they didn't even talk to your parents first? That's rude. With that said, I have to wonder if their mom is actually the one behind it. Is that more likely?\n\nIf I were in your shoes, i'd tell your kids that if they want money they need to earn it. Maybe you can set up an allowance they can earn through chores and whatnot. Otherwise, homemade gifts can cost very little and will hold more sentimental value.", "NTA ex sounds like she is taking advantage of your parents and using your children as pawns. \nYou'll need to be very careful how you phrase it so that it doesn't become a bigger thing. Maybe you and the kids can make ex some homemade bday presents while you talk about asking for money. \nBut I suspect that ex sent the request and the kids were coached into what they told you.  Either way, you need to put a stop to it now or it might become a regular thing.", "NTA I would tell them not to, but give them 20 bucks or so to pick out something  smaller  for her.

Yes you need to talk to them about not using your cash app. Then you need to discuss with them what they would like to do for her birthday. It would be nice if you helped them get her something. Part of raising children is teaching them a loving spirit. Maybe help them make something. Maybe help them get a small gift if that\u2019s all you can afford. But that\u2019s my opinion and you don\u2019t need to help them get anything. Just a kind gesture.", "Nta\nAnd while being calm just tell your kids that they are not to ask your parents for money. And $300 for a present for their mom, sounds like she put them to it. You pay $1,600 for their care support and insurance every month. That's enough and you have to take care of them fully with food and clothes when they're in your care..\n\nJust be nice when you tell them but you need to set that boundary even with that young.", "NAH. Your kids were trying to do something nice, and they might not understand how much $300 is and that your parents can't afford it. Sounds like this is a good opportunity to teach them the value of money. (Not what you're asking but your ex is an A for giving your 4 and 8 year olds phones without consulting you. Coparenting means making important decisions like that together. Personally I think that's way too young for a phone.)", "NTA. Sounds like MOM needed cash and used the kids.I really disdain parents who use kids as pawns for their own dishonest schemes", "NTA. But watch your step. The kids should not be made to feel guilty for this. It is their mother's fault.", "NTA.  Might be time to talk about an allowance though.", "You cannot do what your ex did and involve the kids. Your ex asked them to get that money, and she\u2019ll look bad for doing so.\n\nJust talk with your parents, who are adults, and tell them to ignore requests for money.", "I talked to the kids. I explained that since they were using cash app like a texting app everything they said something they were requesting. Money. They said that their mom set the account up and put it on their phones for them to use.", "Yeah, I'm trying to stay out of the courts. The last time I went the only thing that saved me from owing back support is that anytime I sent her money for use with something rhe kids needed I kept track of it through cash app and had years of receipts to show the judge.", "Yeah it's been rough. I'm trying not to be made into this hateful demon by them. So im really careful about what I do and what I say.", "I do too, that's why I didn't get them one. Any device they use at my house emails me exactly what they access. I don't do unsupervised electronics with them.", "NTA - kids that age do not need access to a cash app. Also, they are at the age where making a gift is totally acceptable. Talk to them about making something and then buy or gather supplies to do so.", "I'm guessing CashApp's terms of service don't even let kids that young use the app.\n\nThat is super shady on ex's part and I'd relay it to my lawyer", "Keep track of this one and any potential future CashApp requests by screen shots and handing over to your lawyer or the family court judge, as most folks don't set transactions to private and anyone can see them.\n\nA child can't set that up or use it. It's definitely your Ex being shady.\n\nPut your number into their phones - or at least get theirs so you have something when you ex erases yours.\n\nNTA. That's pretty sketchy."]}
