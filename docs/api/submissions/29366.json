I have a decent relationship with my MIL, compared to a lot of the horror stories I hear from friends, she\u2019s quite sweet and warm. She is, however, a little\u2026 over-controlling? Overprotective? I\u2019m not sure of the exact word, but she has very strong ideas about things and no sense of boundaries. For example, when she stays at our house she takes over the kitchen completely and insists on cooking all our meals. She cooks wonderfully, but she won\u2019t let me help her at all, and puts everything away in the wrong places - and then insists that her way is more logical. \n\nShe only really comes for holidays, though, and I do like her a lot. So I don\u2019t mind putting up with these mild annoyances. I\u2019m currently pregnant with our little girl, who will be born in a few months. This is a miracle - I really didn\u2019t think it would happen, especially so late, but we got lucky. When my MIL heard, she was super excited and said she would come over to help us get ready for the baby. She offered to stay for the next 6 months or so to help out, because my husband and I both work long hours and it will be hard to handle the baby on top of this. She is also pretty emotionally invested in this, because she truly sees herself as part of our family. She arrived a few days ago and set herself up, then she started with the cleaning. \n\nI like collecting things from garage sales and such. Things like little sculptures and books and baskets, stuff a lot of people would consider utter junk. Our house is definitely overstuffed, but it\u2019s reasonably tidy and doesn\u2019t seem like a hoarder\u2019s house or anything. My MIL, on the other hand, likes everything surgically clean. Yesterday I came home from work to find the house like a war zone, she went through my cabinets and cleared out everything she considered junk, and had apparently made several trips to goodwill before I got home. I was really angry and I asked her why she would ever do this. She said the house has to be tidy for the baby, and that it would be \u201cdangerous\u201d for the baby to be in my cluttered house. \n\nThen she took the next huge bag of stuff and tried to walk out the door. I kind of lost it, and I told her she could get out right now. She was shocked that I was serious, and she said she doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go and it\u2019s so late. It was about 9:30. I booked her a hotel room and called a taxi. \n\nMy husband came home an hour later, and when I told him what happened, he was furious with me. He says I disrespected his mom and was ungrateful for everything she\u2019s trying to do for us.

What your MIL did crossed every line for a guest in anyone's home, and, in fact, you could make a very good case for theft of your belongings. If your MIL truly wanted to help you, she would have asked before she touched a single thing and would have accepted it if you told her \"no\" for any action she wanted to do. Instead - she did everything while you were away, when she knew you could not object or tell her no.\n\nYou also have a husband problem. He made a vow to \"forsake all others until death do you part\" - and it looks like he is not doing that now - it looks like he is choosing his mother over you. He should have been enforcing the sanctity of the two of your home against her overbearing ways all along. And you need to get this worked out now before the baby comes, or your MIL is going to be running your home, not you.", "NTA.

Cause this is wild.", "NTA\n\nWTF?! Seriously w.t.f., who thinks it's in any way acceptable to throw out someone else's stuff like that?", "NTA, but who in their right mind invites their mom/mil to stay at their house **six months** before the baby is due? That\u2019s insane, sorry. And with what she previously did, her taking over was to be expected. (Not her throwing stuff away, that\u2019s also insane.)", "NTA \n\nBut as ever you don\u2019t really have a mil problem as a partner problem. \n\nIf someone comes in and disrespects your home and literally throws your stuff away he should have your back\n\nI think you were wildly optimistic with her staying to \u2018help\u2019 when you already know she\u2019s over controlling and takes over in your own home. \n\nMark my words draw those boundaries before the baby arrives\u2026 as I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll have strong opinions on what to do there", "NTA\n\nYour husband needs to learn that his mum can\u2019t steal your property and throw them away. \n\nHow would your husband feel if you packed up his stuff and gave it all to charity?", "NTA - but your MIL wants to be a mom raising a baby again, your baby.  If you allow her to stay, you will change the relationship with your child forever.  She will never allow you to bond with your child, cook a meal, whatever.  She is taking over your house and she will take over raising your baby.\n\nThis isn\u2019t going to work.  Throwing her out  at 9:30 at night was not the best way to handle this, but her tearing your house apart as if she is in charge and it\u2019s her house is just as wrong.\n\nJust because you like or tolerate your MIL in small doses doesn\u2019t mean it is healthy for you in large doses or permanently.  She isn\u2019t coming for 6 months.  She to,d you 6 months because by that time she will be embedded in your house and won\u2019t leave.\n\nYou and your husband need to have a talk about all of this.  You and your husband and the little human you are growing.  Your life will change with this baby.  You are growing the little human for 40 weeks.  You will have a bond with your baby, you won\u2019t want to leave your baby.  You won\u2019t want to consistently work long hours because you will miss your baby and want to get home quick to be with your baby.  There are no words to adequately describe what you will feel physically, emotionally, and mentally once your baby is born.  My husband and I had high tech, high energy careers.  I travelled a lot for my job.  Totally type A take no prisoners in my career.  When I had our son, everything changed.  I hated traveling all the time, I preferred to be home.  I went from being the in the office or on the road to working from home 3 days a week and having my SIL babysit the other 2 days.  She would babysit more often when I had to travel.  When our son got to be 3 and we wanted him in preschool, I changed positions to eliminate the travel to twice a year because my husband couldn\u2019t control his travel, but I could by changing positions which involved a pay cut, but tolerable because it was important to put the needs of our child first.\n\nYou cannot be an effective parent to your child and develop a bond with your child if you have a MIL that wants to take over your house.  It\u2019s not going to work, she will make you feel incompetent, she already does\u2026 she will take over everything including your baby.  I suspect that is not what you want.  She can\u2019t help herself, it\u2019s who she is.  She doesn\u2019t allow you in your own kitchen when she visits.  Do you really think she will allow you around your own baby??  If you want her raising your child, that\u2019s fine, that is what happens in some cultures, the parents work and the grandparents raise the children.  So as you don\u2019t get to raise your own child, but you will raise your grandchildren, unless the now adult child moves out\u2026. If you want to raise your own child your way, your MIL cannot live with you.  You need to figure out an alternative for child care.", "NTA\n\nYou have a JNMIL and you need to get your husband on the same page as you because this is only going to get worse, not better, when your baby gets here. She will take over there too.", "nta, dont let your mil stay for 6 months. shes supposed to be here to help out and LOWER STRESS for the expecting mother, not THROW HER SHIT OUT and micromanage. she is doing the opposite of helping. you got her a hotel room and a taxi, now its time to tell your husband she aint staying and get him to back you up on this w the convo with his mother", "MIL knew as she did it that she did not have your consent to decide to throw away your belongings. This is a huge step over the line of what is acceptable for a houseguest.That\u2019s why she did it when you were at work. It\u2019s a breach of trust. \n\nI don\u2019t know if there was a better way for you to handle this, but your husband is not giving you support. Certainly you need to handle this before the baby arrives. Maybe this will help establish the boundaries that have been lacking previously.

And congrats, you do have a horror story with your MIL just like everyone else on this sub. :)\n\nYour husband is a bigger problem here, though.

Tell him you will make a list of boundaries that she will not be allowed to cross if he wants to have her visit again. Especially with the baby.

Let her know the boundaries and if she crosses them she will be asked to leave", "NTA... \n\nAs much as I appreciate an uncluttered home, you don't throw away someone elses belongings. \n\nSend husband to hotel along with his mother for the lack of support.", "NTA. \n\nYou have a husband problem though since he didn't back you up when you kicked a robber out of your home!\n\nAnd I've never heard of anyone treating a thief as kindly as to rent them a hotel room and a taxi b4 so how much more nicely did the hubs expect you to treat his criminal mother?", "NTA, she disrespected you.

If they'd done similar things in the past without comment (e.g., was stuff in your kitchen thrown out after MIL was in there?) and you suddenly toss them to the curb....they might be very genuinely hurt and confused. \n\nI think there might be a lot more going on here that we're being told.
