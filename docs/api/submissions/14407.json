We met each other online when we were both starting in college first and second year, ages 20 and 21. We lived in completely different parts of the world and we had a good long distance relationship for 4 years. Finally we got to start building a life together and had to decide on a lot of hard decisions about our future. In the end we decided we would live in my wife's home country, I would rather go through the culture shock of moving to a completely different climate and culture than make my wife do that when she doesn't want to. Our life together and our marriage has been great in my opinion and we really do love each other.\n\nNow in the past we have talked a couple times about the fact that my wife as a baby, about 3-6 months old, had her ears pierced and that it is very common in her country. When ever this topic came up, I always told her my opinion on it and said, I don't want to get our babys ears pierced. Basically our arguments were these:\n\nMe: I don't think we should pierce a babys ears untill they are able to decide for themselves if they want that. And I am worried about the piercings as they will need constant care for a while and have to be very careful with contact with them. Also I feel it might be uncomfortable for the baby and she could not tell us that.\n\nHer: She had that done to her when she was a baby, and even though she stopped using the earrings when she was old enough to choose so. In her opinion it looks beautiful on a baby.\n\nI always hoped we could reach some kind of compromise on this but after few times we forgot about the whole thing. Now recently after our daughter was born, the subject of piercing her ears came up again and I told her what I had said before. My wife said she wants them pierced and as we tried to figure something out she got angry and said \"The mother shouldn't blindly obey the father in what he wants\". I am sure she didn't fully mean what she said and it was just a lot of emotions for what ever reasons. I would want to believe I have been as good of a partner to her as possible over the years and I always want to try understand her point of view and try to make compromises. Now as I think back it's hard for me to think of any things where the compromise wouldn't be heavily in her favor instead of mine. I have always been willing to sacrifice something for her and honestly I don't mind it. But in this thing as it's about our child, I do not want that for her untill she can decide herself. My wife also told me she would pierce the ears with or without my consent. Am I the asshole gor not wanting that and should I just let her do it even if I am truly worried about the piercings and would be very uncomfortable seeing our baby with the earrings.", "created_utc": 1681066061, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12grvs1/aita_for_not_wanting_my_babys_ears_pierced/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

May be time to start rethinking the marriage because she is straight up going to ignore your feelings on a lot of things. \n\nNTA", "NTA. In your case it\u2019s more important for the child to decide if they want to get piercings once they are older, and they will be responsible on their own to take care of them while healing.\n\nThey are your child\u2019s ears and not yours or your wife\u2019s. As long as you would support your child if they personally want them in the future, I see no issue with making sure the decision is fully theirs and not just your wife\u2019s.", "On the one hand, I want to say N T A as someone who works in the body modding industry, no, you should not be piercing a baby's ears. They cannot consent, they can't prevent themselves from touching the wounds which can lead to infection, and it can permanently disfigure your child's ears as they aren't even done developing yet and can (and will) change shape as they grow older. I approach this topic the same as circumcision, just because something is \"part of a culture\" doesn't mean it isn't incredibly outdated and proven to be dangerous, especially when these practices are done to infants who cannot consent or take proper care of the wounds.\n\nHowever, if it's something that's culturally relevant to your wife then **this is something you should have talked about before having a baby.** Her saying \"the mother shouldn't blindly obey the father\" has nothing to do with this. This is a conversation that both parents need to be able to come to an agreement on because it involves their child's health and safety.\n\nThat being said, please, be careful if your wife does try to get your child pierced without your consent. Most professional piercers will **not** pierce baby's ears due to the risks involved that I outlined above - so it might result in her going to someone who *isn't* a professional with standards and that can cause even more health risks and problems (especially if it's someone who uses a piercing gun).\n\nI implore you to do your research on piercing baby ears and share it with your wife, you *do* deserve to have an opinion in this as it concerns your baby's health. The child's health and safety should be placed above placating personal wants. It's not wrong for your wife to want to honor a tradition or her culture (if that's what's going on), but some traditions really aren't healthy and are only upheld because \"my grandfather did it and his grandfather before him\". It's 2023 now, we know better and can do better.\n\nEDIT: I'm making my vote NTA now because your wife is trying to do it behind your back. This is something you two need to come to a middle ground on because it's concerning the health and wellness of your child that you made together. And her trying to do it without your consent is not only cruel, but could result in the baby getting pierced by someone who isn't a professional or trained in the industry.\n\nEDIT 2 because I had missed addressing this part:\n\n>Now as I think back it's hard for me to think of any things where the compromise wouldn't be heavily in her favor instead of mine. I have always been willing to sacrifice something for her and honestly I don't mind it. But in this thing as it's about our child, I do not want that for her untill she can decide herself.\n\nConsidering you moved to her part of the world to make it easier for her and, as you said, you feel like you've been sacrificing a lot, this whole piercing situation just seems like a reflection of a bigger issue - your wife doesn't care about your input as a partner and husband, it's all about what she wants whether or not you agree to it. It has nothing to do with her not wanting to be \"subservient\" to you because she's literally the one steamrolling all the decisions, thus putting *you* in the position that she's afraid to be in (which is projecting). This is something that should be addressed with a third party (such as a counsellor or therapist) because it very likely WILL continue to be a problem in the future.", "NTA it's a pretty clear violation of bodily autonomy and consent. How do we tell girls their bodies are their own if we ok unnecessary body modifications. It's always given me the ick. How does waiting hurt? Is there a reason they want children to be pierced other than the blind adherence to tradition?", "> My wife also told me she would pierce the ears with or without my consent.\n\nNTA. This is not okay. Your say is equally as important as your wife's and by default, you should do nothing if there is no consensus reached.\n\nI will go against the grain and say I don't think piercing a baby's ears is necessarily inappropriate or not okay - parents get their kids braces, circumcise their kids, and do all sorts of other cosmetic things to their kids for cultural reasons. I don't actually have a problem with that, and if you and your wife agreed to do it for cultural reasons, that would be okay in my book. (And no, Reddit, I am not looking to have a debate about braces or circumcision, please.) \n\nBut it is not okay in a parenting relationship for one parent to say \"don't do this, I am not OK with it,\" and for the other parent to just barrel ahead and do it. It sounds like your wife thinks of herself as somehow more important than you or more authoritative than you in making choices for your children, when in fact, it should be an equal partnership. That needs to change.", "NTA.\n\nMost places in my country willing to pierce babies are places that use old equipment that isn't well maintained or proper for piercing procedures as they can lead to long lasting nerve damage because the individuals who use the equipment are not properly trained whatsoever. I'm not sure about your country, but for those reasons alone I'd say that it is unsafe to pierce a child's ears unless you are absolutely sure you can get it done at a genuine piercing parlor of some kind - yes, that means a legitimate tattoo and piercing shop that you have vetted extensively, NOT some outlet store with an old piercing gun they have lying around. Even then, I'd say that child should still be old enough to have a say in something that will permanently scar their body.\n\nHer lack of ability to respect your concerns and the fact that she clearly sees your infant as a doll is worrying.", "NTA \nI feel like body piercings aren\u2019t appropriate for a child that age? I mean maybe it\u2019s a culture thing but why is it necessary for a child to have jewelry like that.. Plus infection risk/the child could rip them out/choke, etc.\n\nIf she goes and does it anyways, you guys might need to have a third party to get involved to negotiate things, eg counseling or something, that doesnt seem very healthy lol\n\nEdited for wording", "NTA, I agree that you should wait until the child is older and can decide for themselves.", "NTA. I think people should have autonomy over optional/cosmetic decisions. The earring holes will grow back if she doesn\u2019t constantly wear them, but the scars on her earlobes will be permanent.\n\nYour wife saying she\u2019ll pierce the baby\u2019s ears without your consent is very worrying.", "NTA, piercing a babies ears is fucked up. Idk why people do that shit. Yeah let\u2019s stab a needle through each ear cuz it looks cool. Plus she said she would pierce the ears with or without your consent\u2026.does she not realize that you\u2019re an equal parent? Dads aren\u2019t second class citizens, you have a say in this too. I\u2019d reconsider this marriage.", "NTA \n\nWait until she gets old enough to ask. If she grows up and doesn't want pierced ears, she will have marks where the holes closed up, they may not go away completely.", "NTA, I (f39) had them done without permission when I was a baby. I don't care they did it but I don't see the point. I would wait until the kid can decide, it's her ears, nobody else's.\nWhere is your wife from? Maybe it's cultural? Most of my friends did it to their baby cause (sadly) it's very common in Spain.", "INFO: is she getting pressure from other family members about this? Obviously, since her own ears were pierced as a baby, her mother and other family believe that it's the thing to do. Ear piercing may not be what you are actually arguing about - is this really all about her family accepting her marriage to you?", "Nta. Teaching your child bodily autonomy is a good thing", "Nta if she feels that she shouldn\u2019t blindly have to obey you how does she feel about taking the decision away from your daughter?  That seems very hypocritical.  It doesn\u2019t matter what either of you want, the only one who has a say in getting her ears pierced is your daughter and she can\u2019t consent.  They do take a lot to keep clean, it\u2019s easy for them to done uneven and she may not want them.  There is no good reason to pierce a baby\u2019s ears.", "NTA. You don't pierce a baby's ears.

Not. Do. It. \nYou're NTA. \n\nI got my ears pierced when I was less than 6 months old, and now I'm older, I regret it. I never wear earrings because the placement of the holes on my ears is too high up to look nice on me. \nIt doesn't look natural or good on an infant. They're literally babies and should not be put into a cycle of \"conventional beauty standards\" \nYou wouldn't paint their nails, give them a wig, or let them wear a necklace, so why would you give them earrings? \n\n\nWhy would you take a perfectly beautiful human baby and poke holes in it? \n\nIt's not okay. It's weird, and once she gets older, she will resent you for it....", "NTA. Your concerns are understandable. Piercings can close, but the tissue is damaged permanently. It sort of reminds me of the arguments for vs. against circumcision. On one hand there's the aspect of keeping with tradition, but on the other hand you are making a choice with a lifelong impact on someone's body without their consent.", "NTA. \nThis isn't about the piercing at all, it's about the inability to agree on a relatively minor thing about your child. Bigger disagreements are almost inevitable and I really suggest you use this opportunity as a warning shot to sit down and talk this out. If need be, with a therapist. Your future self will thank you for this.", "I agree with the bodily autonomy consensus.\nI would also add that ear piercing still growing children results in permanent holes/scars that are asymmetrical in adulthood. (I worked at one of those mall stores that pierced ears and hated torturing children for money b/c parents thought it looked cute).", "NTA. Her reasons are vanity yours are your child's comfort. Piercings are painful, need regular cleaning and can get caught on things. All that just so a baby (who is probably already perfect) can look cuter to your wife.", "NTA...her body her choice and by her I mean your baby.  My mother and father had the same fight.   I didn't get my ears pierced until I was 17.", "Info: what is the religious or cultural significance of ear piercing for your wife? I am strongly leaning toward NTA but I am not sure if this is akin to a case where you married a Jewish woman and are getting upset about circumcision, only lower stakes.", "NTA\nYou don't poke holes into a baby for cute looks without the kids having a say. IMO it's cruel to hurt a baby for no good reason.", "NTA. Leave your babies ears alone until they're old enough to decide for themselves. The mothers belief that \"it looks beautiful\" is completely irrelevant.  It's a child, not a doll. I'm not even sure this is legal in my country.

Would that also be a \"he can make that decision when he's older\" (barring medical issues/complications), or is that an \"it's my culture to do this/I like how it looks, so we're doing it\"? \n\nI'm on your side that this is something your daughter should get to choose when she's older, but I want to make sure you don't have a double standard here. \n\nAlso, if you end up compromising on this, make sure your wife takes your daughter to a medical facility or real piercing studio where they use a sterile, single-use needle. No piercing guns at the mall!! If she can't find a medical professional or piercing professional (a real professional, not \"I took a 1 hour course from Claire's University\") willing to do this to a baby, that's a sign.", "I wonder how the people talking about bodily autonomy here feel about circumcision....\n\nESH\n\nYou two come from different cultures. In her culture, it seems it's normal to pierce a baby's ear. You are not considering it cultural, but rather aesthetic, but something to be cultural doesn't have to be written in a holy book, but rather be a widespread occurrence.\n\nBeing in a relationship with someone from another culture requires being open minded and understanding. It seems neither of you are like that.", "NTA\nDon't let her do the to your kid, is a stupid practice people without a brain do.", "This is a tough situation to navigate - I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a realistic compromise here, because you\u2019re either piercing the baby\u2019s ears or not. And there could be familial pressure on her side.\n\nHowever, I do think it is important that one parent can\u2019t unilaterally decide how your (plural) child is raised. \n\nTo me, a child\u2019s consent to a cosmetic procedure is important, so I\u2019m with you on this one.\n\nNTA. Possibly NAH, but this will be a contentious issue no matter the outcome.", "NTA - culture or no, if bodily autonomy is infringed upon, it's bad.", "Absolutely NTA. Bodily autonomy and consent are critical concepts for kids to learn, especially for girls (at least in the heteronormative patriarchy I live in). So the fact that you\u2019re aware of this and trying to live those values early is commendable. Also, one of the beautiful things about being a parent is that you don\u2019t have to do things the way they were always done; you get to choose which things from your respective pasts to carry forward into your new family.\n\nIMO the values of consent and bodily autonomy outweigh aesthetics by a mile.

My mum  pierced my ears and my sister\u2019s ears when we were babies.

The  point is that we both told her she should have waited until we were old enough to decide for ourselves.", "NTA. You aren't saying never, you're saying let her decide when she's old enough to have an opinion. Your wife is saying it makes a baby pretty. That's not a good enough reason not to wait. And it's certainly not a good enough reason for her to get it done without your consent. \n\nTell your wife that your baby is already pretty and earrings can't possibly improve on that. And that you can revisit the issue later when the baby is no longer a baby, but capable of making a meaningful choice about this. Piercing ears always hurts - some people prefer to do it to a baby because they think the baby won't remember. But imo that's not good enough reason to do it just for aesthetics. Earring holes can grow in, but depending on how long they've been there, they may never fully do so without leaving scar tissue.\n\nIt sounds like this is a cultural thing for her, but it's a bodily autonomy thing for you. Try expressly phrasing your objections in that way - it's not just earrings, but any major permanent cosmetic modifications to your baby that you are vetoing on principle.

They\u2019re not as safe or sanitary and have very little training. It\u2019s also very easy to get the piercings uneven this way without anyone noticing until the kid is older (this happened with my niece). \n\nI recommend googling a lot of info and going over it with your wife. If she\u2019s choosing this hill to die on, make sure it\u2019s a fully informed one.

I read a story where here in the US at a popular mall place employees have to pierce the ears of an infant/ child even of they scream their heads off and verbalize they don't want to (if they're old enough to speak). Also it could be a potential choking hazard if they come out and baby end up putting it in their mouth. \nPerosnally I feel that the no trumps the yes as this is technically body modification.

Is this a ritual that has spiritual importance to your wife?", "If it is cultural for her I see no reason not to do it. If the child doesn\u2019t want them when she grows up it\u2019s easy to stop wearing earrings and let the holes close. \n\nMy mother was of the no earrings ilk and my dad is from a culture where babies ears are pierced.

She brought SIL, SIL's daughter in law and granddaughter to the salon. Once there they said they were there for ear piercing. DIL didn't want to stay and expected my aunt to.

Spouses should try to work through things as much as possible and fully consider the other person's feelings and reasoning.\n\nThat said, each marriage DOES need a way to get past the impasses. Usually the couple chooses one person to be the tiebreaker in various situations. For example, I am the tie-breaker when it comes to finance issues. My wife is the tie-breaker when it comes to education issues.\n\nThe catch is that while the tie-breaker gets more power in these decisions, they *also* have to take full responsibility if the decision turns out to be the wrong one. They also usually have to be involved in all of those kinds of decisions day-to-day so that they can stay informed.\n\nSo the two of you need to figure out who gets to be the tie-breaker when it comes to the kid. Just remember that if it's you, then you are going to be on the hook for the other decisions about the kid. Do you want to be responsible for most of the day-to-day care and decisions about your daughter? If you don't have the time for that, then you need to let your wife be the tiebreaker.\n\nNAH\n\nEdit: I just noticed that she said she's going to do it no matter what you say, so I'm changing this to NTA but you both need to still talk through the leadership role when it comes to the kid because there are more impasses ahead.

On the other hand, if it\u2019s so popular in your country it\u2019s more likely the professional piercers will work on infants.\n\nRegarding hygiene- it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier for YOU to keep the piercings clean on an infant than it is for a toddler/kid to keep them clean. Because you\u2019re responsible and you\u2019re already bathing them, and because kids are awful at it. \n\nThose concerned about babies tugging on the earrings are correct- and why you should avoid hoop earrings which are popular on babies in some countries.\n\nSo what age would be acceptable to you?

We met each other online when we were both starting in college first and second year, ages 20 and 21. We lived in completely different parts of the world and we had a good long distance relationship for 4 years. Finally we got to start building a life together and had to decide on a lot of hard decisions about our future. In the end we decided we would live in my wife's home country, I would rather go through the culture shock of moving to a completely different climate and culture than make my wife do that when she doesn't want to. Our life together and our marriage has been great in my opinion and we really do love each other.\n\nNow in the past we have talked a couple times about the fact that my wife as a baby, about 3-6 months old, had her ears pierced and that it is very common in her country. When ever this topic came up, I always told her my opinion on it and said, I don't want to get our babys ears pierced. Basically our arguments were these:\n\nMe: I don't think we should pierce a babys ears untill they are able to decide for themselves if they want that. And I am worried about the piercings as they will need constant care for a while and have to be very careful with contact with them. Also I feel it might be uncomfortable for the baby and she could not tell us that.\n\nHer: She had that done to her when she was a baby, and even though she stopped using the earrings when she was old enough to choose so. In her opinion it looks beautiful on a baby.\n\nI always hoped we could reach some kind of compromise on this but after few times we forgot about the whole thing. Now recently after our daughter was born, the subject of piercing her ears came up again and I told her what I had said before. My wife said she wants them pierced and as we tried to figure something out she got angry and said \"The mother shouldn't blindly obey the father in what he wants\". I am sure she didn't fully mean what she said and it was just a lot of emotions for what ever reasons. I would want to believe I have been as good of a partner to her as possible over the years and I always want to try understand her point of view and try to make compromises. Now as I think back it's hard for me to think of any things where the compromise wouldn't be heavily in her favor instead of mine. I have always been willing to sacrifice something for her and honestly I don't mind it. But in this thing as it's about our child, I do not want that for her untill she can decide herself. My wife also told me she would pierce the ears with or without my consent. Am I the asshole gor not wanting that and should I just let her do it even if I am truly worried about the piercings and would be very uncomfortable seeing our baby with the earrings.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The same PP I got my ears pierced at. I judged those parents hard!\n\n\u201cIt looks beautiful.\u201d No it looks weird. It looks like your baby is rebelling against you before it can speak or walk. Piercings require a lot of constant care after they\u2019re put in, and a fussy baby isn\u2019t gonna be on board with it at all. There\u2019s tons of risk with infections and something going wrong.

It is just fucked up to do that to a baby.", ">Babies don\u2019t consent to anything you do to them. Parents make decisions all the time that babies don\u2019t consent to.\n\nActually, there's a wonderful philosophy created by Magda Gerber called RIE, and it's all about how we can be respectful to infants. It's a practice I used in my work with children and with our own son. You can model respectful interactions even at infancy. Consent is often given --or not-- through the nonverbal cues of the infant and requires us to pay attention to our own behavior and motivations for why we want our babies to do what we want them to do. In other words, your baby might not be happy to have a diaper change, but you do it as respectfully and soothing them as much as possible with empathy for the fact that something is being done TO them that they don't enjoy. It's a different mindset, for sure. If you are curious, I've got a link. I love the teaching part of helping children to learn to care for themselves in a respectful way.   \n\n\n[https://magdagerber.org/magdas-writings/magda-gerbers-basic-rie-basic-principles/](https://magdagerber.org/magdas-writings/magda-gerbers-basic-rie-basic-principles/)", "Well here's one for ya. I hate that my ears were pierced as a baby. My parents forced me to wear earrings for years so that \"the holes don't close\". I hated wearing earrings, would take them out as soon as I could each day at preschool, and then get in trouble for taking them out. Now, as an adult, I almost never wear earrings. Literally don't remember the last time I did. The irony is that my holes never close up, no matter how long I go between wearing earrings. \n\nMy daughter did not get her ears pieced as a baby, and I won't allow it until she's old enough to ask for herself, and take care of them by herself.", ">I\u2019ve never heard of a woman being mad that she had her ears pierced young.\n\nThey do exist, you just haven't talked to the ones who had to live with excessively scarred ears or blood diseases after the fact. Not to mention, getting pierced \"young\" doesn't mean getting pierced as a baby, the minimum age for most piercers is around 9 because at least most 9 year olds can still understand what they're getting done and can follow general aftercare rules like \"no touching\". Babies can't do that.\n\nJust because a baby \"can't consent to anything\" doesn't mean it's a free pass to make body modifications to said baby for no reason beyond your own vanity and \"personal preferences\". It's a purely aesthetic body modification that comes with no benefit to the baby but *all* the risks and consequences if something goes wrong. It's not worth making the baby look \"pretty\" in your own eyes, babies aren't dolls for dressing up.", "I hate the fact that my ears were pierced young. I apparently jumped at the sound of the piercing gun and my bottom holes are completely uneven. To get it fixed now would be complicated. I ended up getting second holes to wear earrings and look good.", "My niece had her ears pierced as a baby and despite careful care by her mother, had repeat infections.

But honestly there really isn\u2019t a compromise.", "As I understand, it is just a very common thing that is considered beautiful. I remember when it first came up she was very surprised I had never seen a baby with pierced ears before.", "I love your breakdown of this, thank you!", "Woah! Hold your horses. \nMen absolutely can and do get their ears pierced. \nGender has nothing to do with this.", "No, most girls don't get it done as babies everywhere.", "Every time I see an infant with pierced ears, I just kind of do this mental, \u201cOh, they\u2019re those kind of people.\u201d", "I think the look cute honestly, still didn\u2019t do it though and she\u2019s 10 now and doesn\u2019t want them which is fine by me.", "Eh I don\u2019t think she will have it done somewhere unsafe. Op mentioned moving to their wife\u2019s country. Paired with the other context of the story it seems like the wife is from a county where piercing a babies ears is the cultural norm (probably South America or parts of Southeast Asia). Since it\u2019s so prevalent it\u2019s not going to be done at a Claire\u2019s like it would in the US. Many South American countries have it done at the hospital. It used to be done immediately after birth and the child would get small pure gold hoops. Now it\u2019s more commonly seen at the appointment following the child\u2019s first or second birthday. \n\nAs someone from one of those cultures (who had it done as a baby and tbh kinda loved it since I wasn\u2019t the one who had to deal with aftercare) I\u2019d say it\u2019s just one of those culture shock moments where it\u2019s perfectly normal to the wife (to the point where it\u2019s very possible the kid will be subjected to bullying in that country if they don\u2019t have theirs ears pierced) but seems crazy to OP and other foreigners. \nIf your wife is from one of these cultures, it could be that she might not even know the history behind it as now a days it\u2019s just a given that baby girls in certain cultures will have their ears pierced so this could be a good time for both of you to learn about the history behind it to make an informed decision on if this is a tradition your daughter will participate in. Unsure about SE Asia but in Latin cultures, piercing a babies\u2019s ears is a ritual similar to how some places have rituals surrounding the first haircut. It\u2019s usually done with a needle by a medical professional (often a nurse or midwife directly after birth) and the baby is given gold studs or hoops by the grandparents. It symbolizes many things depending on the type of earrings and who gives them/puts them on the child but some of the most common ones are: a version of the evil eye keeping negativity away from the baby until their intuition develops, a connection to their ancestors (especially in countries where the gold is mined), wishes of good health and prosperity for the baby, and a symbol or even gift of future wealth since the baby will eventually grow out of their first pair of gold earrings and once that happens, they can be sold or saved in case the child ever needs funds. When given by grandparents (or even parents as is more common now) it\u2019s essentially a promise that the baby will always be taken care of (not in mine but I know in some cultures it\u2019s a way of saying the baby is \u201cclaimed\u201d by people or love them or promised to a religion which keeps negative spirits/corruption away). It\u2019s kinda the cultural/ritual equivalent of a grandparent starting a 529 for a kid. \n\nThe core issue here isn\u2019t the piercings, it\u2019s the wife steamrolling OP\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s important to remember that the baby is in a special position where they get to grow up with two culture\u2019s so this decision will set the precedent of what will happen when those culture\u2019s views don\u2019t align. If you were ever going to pick a hill, it should be this one. Not the hill that your baby can\u2019t get their ears pierced but the hill of how you and your wife make choices when it comes to the baby. \nAs far as choices go, this is a pretty easy one to start with because there are so many options/compromises (getting them done now, waiting until x milestone (such as the baby being able to decide for themselves or is an adult etc\u2026)) even if you both agree to have it done now it\u2019s an opportunity for your wife to explain her reasoning, the importance of it to her culture, and for you to become involved in the culture and process or vise versa if you both decide not to do it. \nThis is the start of hundreds of choices that your wife and you will have to make in regards to your child so it\u2019s important to start off on the right foot and have a conversation about how you\u2019re going to approach conflicts like this (may even be helpful to have a third party present like a Telehealth or in person therapist). These things will continue to come up and odds are you\u2019ll have to continue to adapt the way you approach decisions as your relationship and child matures but not being respectful and going behind each other\u2019s back the way your wife is telling you she will is bound to cause issues both now and down the line.", "From how OP phrased it, the fact they \"forgot about it\" seems less like they actually had a discussion about it and more like something that just came up in passing ages ago that they clearly didn't revisit before the child was born.\n\nMentioning it once god knows how long ago before the baby was born is not the same as \"talking about it beforehand\".", "Circumcising an infant is never medically necessary.  Find a new comparison.", "Yea, I don't know any either.\n\nAt most I can list a few artists who might be okay doing that kind of work on a minor assuming that minor is at least like... 13 or so and has all the necessary paperwork to prove that all main custodial guardians give an okay (as in: both mother and father would need to sign on a dotted line). Even then, I know some shops won't even bother doing work on any minor for anything because it can be seen as a bad look by others.", "If it is so special then why did she stop wearing her earrings?", "Yeah NTA then. It is a decision that should be made together and indeed preferably with the input of your child.", "That\u2019s exactly OP\u2019s position now, and therefore by definition is not a compromise between OP\u2019s position and his wife\u2019s position.", "Clip on earrings for an infant?  Sure, if you want them to choke and/or swallow them.", "But that still carries the issue of being done without consent, and can carry a greater risk of infection/damage because children that age are more likely to play with new piercings than a young infant who is still figuring out how to control their arms and hands. \n\nI am in no way saying the answer is to pierce her ears (none of my kids got any piercings until they asked for them and were old enough to take care of them).  It\u2019s just rubbing me the wrong way that OP is framing this as an issue for \u201ccompromise\u201d and implicitly criticizing his wife for not compromising when there is no reasonable compromise option here.", "Part of the reason you likely haven't seen it before is because less and less parents are doing it now fully understanding that it's an unsafe practice. Not to mention most legitimate professional piercers with standards won't pierce babies anyways because they know the risks involved and that the child cannot consent, not until they're at least old enough (around 8 years old for most piercers but it varies by country and regulations) to understand what they're about to go through. Piercings are a body modification process that come with risks of excessive scarring, infection, and contracting bloodborne illnesses such as HIV and hepatitis - risks that are only mitigated by ensuring it's done by a professional in a sterile environment with sterile tools, on clients who are capable of following aftercare instructions after they've gone home.\n\nWe did what we thought was fine back then because we didn't know better. Now we know better, so we do better.", "I'm on the fence with this and will have to go with NTA. I'm a big believer in personal autonomy for even infants (no cutting/piercing until they are old enough to decide they want it, unless it was for medical reasons, and this isn't that).

I had mine pierced before kindergarten and only had them in for two years before it was just a hassle. Plus, hair and hairbrushes can get snagged on them. They can get torn with little-kid rough play.

The issue isn't that there isn't a middle ground, the issue is that OP's wife seems to have a history (from what OP said) of putting OP in the position of making sacrifices and bending on his wants and needs in favor of what *she* wants - and that's being compounded by the wife saying she'll get the baby's ears pierced anyways with or without his consent as if his input as the baby's father and co-caretaker doesn't matter (which it does, especially when it comes to piercings which doesn't benefit the baby in any way but CAN come with severe consequences for the baby only if things don't go smoothly.)", "In all probability yes, but it doesnt mean a man couldn't possibly understand having pierced ears.", "And it\u2019s a part of some people\u2019s culture to stone women for having premarital sex.\n\nDoesn\u2019t make it right.", "Something being a cultural practice does not make it sacrosanct.

I fervently believe that permanent cosmetic changes should not be made to a person\u2019s body without their informed consent. A baby is incapable of informed consent.", "So is genital mutilation\u2026 so\u2026", "So is genital mutilation and child weddings, does the fact that those are part of some peoples culture make it okay?", "What an stupid culture...", "Almost always.\nI married one that didnt, he is circumcised for that exact reason. \nIt was very medically necessary.", "I have not once advocated for having the baby\u2019s ears pierced.", "At that age, they typically use a locking or screw-on earring back that is pretty hard to get off, especially without good two-handed fine motor control that infants lack.", "You are assuming OP is a reliable narrator.", "Yep. I have a relative who works in the ER who\u2019s seen a LOT of babies and toddlers brought in when their skin has grown over the flat earring backs. They have to cut them out. Put me off the idea entirely.", "Sure. Welcome to /r/AITA."]}
