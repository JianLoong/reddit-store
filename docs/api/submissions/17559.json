It all started to go south when she started having kids. She thinks if she has a kid we ALL have to help her. I was 15 watching my nephew until 4am as she was ignoring my calls on a school night. Would say she gonna be gone for 1 hour and comes back in 3-4. Since then I do not help with kids or give money. She does not have the financial resources to raise all these kids. \n\nAll of her kids were paper babies, as in the baby father would marry her, get her pregnant, and then leave once they got approved for papers. The oldest has his dad in his life. He\u2019s a good dad. The other two dads are not.They do not give her money or help out with the kids. She has a tendency of asking anyone and EVERYONE for money.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for about 11 months. He lives with me and tends to help out everywhere in any way he can. He\u2019s a kind person. The type of person my sister is tends to take advantage of people like that.

And gets gifts for the kids during holidays and birthdays. \n\nIt started to go downhill when she would go to him to talk about me when me and her would have arguments. Tell him \u201cgood luck when you have kids with her.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t date her.\u201d Etc. I didn\u2019t say anything but it annoyed me.

She wants to take advantage of him and I won\u2019t allow that. They still can take in person just no pm. So, AITA For removing my sister off my boyfriend phone?\n\n\nEdit: I DID DISCUSS IT WITH MY BOYFRIEND PRIOR TO REMOVAL. I did not go behind his back. He agreed with me it was for the best and let me do the removing so I would take the heat when she questioned it. I wouldn\u2019t do it without his permission.

Would you let your S.O. Disrespect your siblings ?", "What confrontation? He\u2019s blocking her from his phone. He\u2019s not confronting her. And who said anything about disrespecting your siblings? You can have a confrontation without being disrespectful.\nHe doesn\u2019t need to \u201cgo off\u201d on her either.
