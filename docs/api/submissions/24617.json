Yo dad and sister sucks. NTA", "NTA. Your father did not do his job to protect you and he sounds like he chooses to remain blissfully ignorant of that. At this point, you could probably shout it from the rooftops and he will not hear it, because it does not agree with the image he has of himself.

Your sister ruined her reputation, not you. Sounds like you know this already, but I want to stress that the behaviors you listed ABSOLUTELY ARE ABUSIVE. Your father should be ashamed of himself for not giving either of his daughters the help they need.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t received the support you deserve from your dad, and that you had to put up with your abuse for as long as you did.

Both your dad and your sis can tap what they sow. And maybe your family will push to get your sister some kind of treatment.\n\nI would just forward any nasty texts from them to the whole fam. Keep it all out in the open. And move and cut contact with her as soon as you can.", "NTA. And now you start screenshotting the verbal abuse from your sister and posting that on every social media you have and tag all your family.

I was fed up.\n\nI didn't yell, I didn't scream. I just packed my bag and left, late at night, without telling anyone, leaving a note apologizing to my aunt. They didn't know I'd left until late the next morning. This was pre cell phones, so they had no way of contacting me until I got back, over 24 hours later.\n\nSo then my brother was exposed in front of the whole family, bc they had to explain why I wasn't there.\n\nMy parents agreed I'd been poorly treated. I didn't talk to my brother for six months until he apologized. His behavior changed completely thereafter, to his credit. I guess he finally figured out he had to get over whatever juvenile bullshit was driving him.\n\nSometimes you have to draw a line.", "Publicly, but it's close!", "Thank you"]}
