You were abused.  Your sister had issues that needed to be dealt with.  Your dad is a crappy parent and is trying to pretend he wasn't.  Tell anyone you wish about how you were treated.

Anyway, NTA.", "Mine did too. He thought it was hilarious to physically abuse me. He would punch me as hard as he could. My mom never believed me and actually accused me of making it up. Then she saw the bruises one day - I didn't show her then she just saw them and was shocked. Asked what happened I told her again he's been hitting me and she was like why didn't you tell me? I DID!! I said you didn't believe me. She confronted him about it when he came home and of course he denied it. I can't remember what happened. But I do know she was being abused by a family member as a child and loves to tell anyone who will listen that nobody believed her. One of the last time I bothered speaking with her she went on about how her mother didn't believe her I said well what was she supposed to do? I told you what was happening to me and you didn't believe me. If it's ok for you to think I'm lying about my own brother physically abusing me why is it not ok for your mother not to believe you? She dropped the issue.\n\nDear Parents: kids don't USUALLY make things up for the shit of it. Even if what they said is a lie there is a reason for it. Talk to your kids and listen to them!

If your sister didn't want to ruin her reputation then she shouldn't have been such a psycho bully growing up.

I'm sorry for what she put you through.", "NTA This is your truth and you have a right to share it with your family just as your dad had a right to share his view and your sister has a right to her opinion.  You are all equally members of the family.  That's what happens in families.  You share your business, disagree, people take views and everyone moves on.  If your dad and sister don't want this brought up then they shouldn't tell their version in the presence of your sisters' victim.", "NTA. The way your dad and sister reacted shows that no real progress has been made by either of them so you're not digging up anything.", "No, your SISTER ruined her own reputation...

Not that I did much good at that point.  I literally ran away from home few weeks later.  I was way old to be doing so.  The parentification is also hard.", "Nta do yourself a favor and go no contact when both of those losers", "Indeed, keeping someone awake for days at a time is literally defined as torture.  \n\nSleep deprivation is considered a form of torture because it has serious and lasting effects on a person's health and well-being.

Add it on there!", "[removed]", "NTA.\n\n>But now my sister said I ruined her reputation\n\nYou have done that yourself, Anakin!", "NTA. At all. I had an abusive older brother. Violently and psychologically abusive. You have no obligation to protect anyone\u2019s reputation by keeping silent about what you went through. Your dad certainly never tried to protect you.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t sought therapy for these experiences, I would highly recommend it. What you went through was not teasing; it was absolutely abuse and you deserve to work through that in a space where you are believed and cared for.\n\nI\u2019m glad you received some sympathetic messages from other family members. It sounds like at some some relatives have your best interests at heart.", "NTA.  You need to text or email your sister, or some sort of written correspondence, and tell her to stop contacting you and that what she is doing constitutes harassment.  I'm not sure if you're in the US but, in virtually every state in the US, if what she is texting you is verbally abusive, then she's in violation of criminal harassment statutes.  Print out screen shots of the verbal abuse, go down to your local police department, and file charges against her.  \n  \nThat ought to stop the harassment real quick and, if not, she'll just be digging the hole she's in deeper.", "NTA you didn't 'ruin' her reputation you just made sure people knew who she really was. if the truth damaged her then she can reconsider her life.\n\nif she's still living with you. sister or not-it is abuse. if she does it again. call the police.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister actively abused you throughout your childhood, and your father is no better for enabling her behavior. \n\nIf I were you, I would just cut all ties with those two.", "NTA.  Your sister doesn't have a reputation to ruin.", "NTA. They're not good people.\n\nYou okay?", "NTA\n\nthey can call the whambulence and cry about it, but it doesn't change the fact that they both disregarded how you felt for years and blame everyone else but your sister for her behavior.", "NTA sister or not it's abuse and assault, if she does it again, call the police.", "Out of curiosity, how did you mother respond to that last bit? Because that level of call out would either lead to massive amount of self-reflection and empathy (hopefully for you, but hell, maybe even for her own mother), or she would just turn around, put her head in the sand, and tell herself that of course her situation was different.", "My older sister was also physically abusive to me. When we became adults, I made it clear that I was able and would kick her behind, she stopped. However, she became more covert in the verbal abuse. We both had daughters. That abuse became generational and covert. Until I found out about it.\n\nHope OP blocks both of them.", "She gave up arguing with me I suspect because she saw the logic of what I was saying but still wanted to continue blaming her mother because it was easier. And tbh I don't not blame grandma for not believing her but I was just trying to get her to realize that she did the same thing to me. And fundamentally I can see how someone you knew your whole life as being who you see them, and having that challenged and rejecting it. But you're no better off for ignoring the issues and denying them. She always believed him when he denied having done anything and even went as far as accusing me of menstruating \"it's that time of the month huh?\" because you know women aren't allowed to have upset or negative feelings outside their menstrual cycle right?\n\nAnd she actually did try to argue hers was different. My brother was physically hitting me and leaving bruises but she was being SA'd by her uncle as a child - but again my point is that abuse is abuse in all forms and she told us to tell her if someone was hurting us. I did and she didn't believe me."]}
