I have been growing it for the better part of three decades, however, my wife and I agreed that we have more than enough for me to retire and so I am.\n\nSome backstory: Back when John was in high school I gave him a job at my business, and soon after he started he asked if I could give his friend Sam (32M, now, 17 when he started) a job as well. John was not interested in the work and quit after 4 months, and I will whole heartedly admit that that was very painful at the time, but Sam loved the job. He continued to work throughout college where he went into the same field as me, and I gave him a promotion when he completed his studies. Sam is very much my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I see him as my second son. John studied finance and, after working at some other places, asked me if I could give him a job. I did and he's extremely good at what he does. I love the fact that I get to work with the both of them.\n\nI took my wife, John, Susan and Sam out to dinner last week to tell them my plan for retirement. Sam will take my place and own 60% while John and Susan would each get 20%. I have never seen John so furious. He asked how I could choose Sam over him, my own flesh and blood. He also said he's the one who studied running businesses and that he should be the one in charge. I told him that he has only worked for me for a few years and already quit once, whereas Sam has been working for me for 15 years, knows all the clients, the products and the production team, and has their respect. He then I asked if he had my respect and I told him of course, he's the best at what he does, but that doesn't mean he's the best fit for being the boss. My wife and Susan tried deescalating the situation but John left in huff and hasn't been talking to anyone but Susan since.\n\nI know John's hurt, but Sam is the better choice since he's been working directly under me for years and knows the ins and outs better than anyone but me. I've tried talking to John and apologizing, but he won't let me. AITA?\n\nedit: Some people keep asking why I gave Susan the same amount and what her relation to the business is. She's worked off and on as a contractor and, especially since she has kids of her own, I wanted to give her some financial stability. It's the same with John, as he's never expressed any interest in running the place and came back to work for me because he got laid off and had a hard time finding another job, I wanted to ensure some financial stability for him while making sure Sam was the one in charge.", "created_utc": 1681064606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gr7ej/aita_for_leaving_my_business_to_my_prot\u00e9g\u00e9/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be obvious to most people that this should be a conversation to have over a long period of time, individually with each of the three concerned parties. Announcing the completed decision was bound to set off some unpredictable feelings.\n\nBest solution as I see it would have been to *sell* the business, at a below market value, to the three of them in exactly the proportions you suggested. But only after individually explaining your plan to each of them & getting their feedback (starting with Susan because she's the one most removed from the business, but most likely to be able to predict her brother's reaction), and tweaking the plan based on their input.\n\nBut now, you've created a rift between them and it will be incredibly difficult for them to operate as partners. You'll have to talk to them again, and find a way to show John that he's not second fiddle to your \"second son\"", "Who is going to keep the business running best so it could be passed down to the next generation?\n\nYou would know that answer more than anyone and made your choice. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

It\u2019s a business and the honest answer is, Sam will be better at running it and taking care of it. He knows the business and the work. My money is on John selling it in a year because his heart isn\u2019t in it or cutting sam out because he\u2019s jealous. \nJohn isn\u2019t entitled to a thing", "The very fact that John believes that the blood relationship should factor into the management of the business is proof that he is not the right person to own it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You made your decision based on business acumen, experience, and customer relationships. Your son expected you to make your decision based upon DNA. you behaved like an astute businessman instead of a spraying tomcat and you should take pride in that.", "NTA. He never should have assumed he would be made head of things when you eventually stepped down/died and from the sounds of it you never gave him that implication \n\nThis might be hitting harder simply because he knows and is friends with Sam but ultimately if someone else had come along and been in Sam's position you'd have done things the same way \n\n\nAt the end of the day 15 years and being well involved with the day to day running out ranks being your son with I'm guessing a handful of years involvement", "NTA\n\nJust because you have children does not mean a business should automatically be handed to Them. It sounds like John\u2019s a much better employee now compared to when he was in high school (I should hope so, but that isn\u2019t always the case), but Sam sounds as if she\u2019s been a part of all aspects of this business throughout these last fifteen years and is truly passionate about it.\n\nI personally would have made the percentages a bit different, since you never mentioned your daughter working at the business, and she gets an equal amount as the sibling who does work there, but whatever.\n\nBut just because you aren\u2019t the Ahole doesn\u2019t mean your relationship isn\u2019t potentially permanently scarred from this decision, as well as Sam\u2019s relationship with him. Still, this is your legacy you built, and you should absolutely leave it for the person you have the most faith in keeping it alive.\n\nThere is a fair chance you will no longer have a relationship with your son again. Not saying that\u2019s right or wrong, it just is. John has a right to feel like he\u2019s been replaced by his (former) friend in your eyes.", "Just wondering how you gave the business.\nSounds like Sam now owns the business and has full control. This is a complex arrangement that could tear the business and your family apart. \n\nI think you should have talked about it with your children before giving it to someone outside the family. I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t. Is it because you already knew John would disagree?", "NTA. Going to school and \u201cstudying how to run business\u201d does not qualify one to takeover an established business more than the one whose been there for 15 years actually leaning the business and the industry. \n\nYou maybe could have gone about it a better way, but, question - what\u2019s Susan\u2019s involvement in the business?", "NTA.

At that age many kids buck against what their parents do or want - its totally normal. So Im not surprised he left. BUT he came back. He studied something that would add value to the business and he came back and worked for you.\n\nSecondly: You are giving Susan  -- who did absolutely nothing for the business, equal share to John who has been working for you and contributing to the business. How is that fair?\n\nLastly: Sam may have worked for you all these years and may know all the ins and outs of the business, however at no point did you ever have a conversation with John (and Susan ) about leaving the business to Sam, so it would be a natural conclusion that you would be leaving this business that you have built up, to your own children.\n\nIs there any way you can leave the ownership of the business to John and Susan equally BUT with a clause that Sam is to run it or be in charge of it for however long he wants? Something like that?\n\nIf you had done this to me, I wouldnt be hurt, Id be quitting the business and opening up a rival business and putting yours in the ground. Nor would I be speaking to you again. Not because you didnt leave the business to me, but because you announced this without even a discussion with me -- blindsiding me. \n\nAs far as you and John are concerned, Im pretty certain a mere apology isnt going to cut it.", "My husband has a business. My son has worked for my husband during summers since gr. 10 and from May to August while in university. He also worked for 3 years straight, as he tried to figure out what he actually wanted to do. He never wanted to take the business over, BUT, it was always discussed. We never assumed our son would OR wouldn't want to run it. We've talked about it ever since our son started working. Now, it's likely that my son-in-law will take it over. Again, we TALKED about it. I think YTA for not talking about it, and I think you're being unfair to your son, judging him based on high school behaviour. He's currently working for you and you said he's doing a good job. Why are you giving your son the same shares as your daughter, who seems to have had nothing to do with the company? How is that fair?", "NTA - You can choose how you would like to split the company however way you like.  I don't think being flesh and blood means they are entitle to the company by default.", "Ooofff, this is hard.\n\nI'm going with NTA, but, I'd recommend you change the percentages.\nYour son doesn't want to \"less\" than Sam in ownership. I think \"equal\" would be better.\n\n\nI would give Susan 20%\n\nI'd give John 37%\n\nI'd give Sam 37%\n\nI'd keep 6%.\n\nThat way they have equal ownership but neither has more than the other.\n\nI'd also put a clause in the contract that says when Susan wants to sell, it needs to be 50/50 to each.\n\nThat way you have longer to decide who will be the majority owner later on when you transfer your 6%>", "INFO\n\nit is possible your son made a decision about his life path to please you, as you said he did not enjoy the work as a younger person and then came back. \n\nif this is true, it would be infuriating from his point of view to (possibly) choose your major and go back to your dad's business to gain approval or perhaps financial security, only to be usurped by someone who is not family. This is possibly a conversation you should have had with your son a long, long, time ago. \n\nIs it possible that your son has been under the wrong impression for many years? Is it possible this could have been avoided by having a simple, but uncomfortable, conversation years ago? Have you ever explicitly let him know that he should follow his own life path, and that you expect him to make the bulk of his own money? It sounds silly but if you have given up things, made compromises based on an outcome that you assumed was assured, it would be absolutely infuriating to learn otherwise at the last hour. \n\nOf course, it is perfectly reasonable that you chose the best candidate for the future of your business.", "INFO:\n\nWhen you son asked for a job, was it because he had an interest in eventually running it?\n\nHas he shown any interest in running it?\n\nHow long has he worked there now?\n\nHad you taken the time to discuss his interest in taking over the family business prior to your decision?\n\nHas Susan shown any interest in the company? Has she ever worked there?\n\nAny particular reason why Susan would get the same amount of shares as your son?\n\nAs for your opinion on his decision not to work there when he was a teenager, to me it's completely understandable that your son didn't want to follow in the family business *when he was a teenager*, so holding his decision against him feels a bit harsh.\n\nMy question on that last part then is very basic. Is it possible your son didn't come back to the business because of how hurt you were when he decided to go about his life without you? Did you perhaps place a stigma on the notion of him returning to work for you which inevitably caused him to not return so quickly after college?", "NTA. I completely understand your decision. Your son should be glad that you give him something, not to cry that someone else, who actually deserves more, gets more.", " YTA- because John did sacrifice more than Sam. And way more than Susan. Being the child of an entrepreneur is hard. I know I am one. The amount of sacrifices families make and the stress the family takes on when business is slow is immeasurable. And you gave Sam a significant controlling share of the business to boot.\n\nYou just made a dangerous business decision. If John is a good businessman, he can still screw over Sam, and will likely go NC with you.", "Info what's the problem? You get to give your business to this person and your kids are not obligated to have a relationship with you", "YTA. Imagine not giving your business to your son.", "NTA and you are doing good work for no partaking in nepotism but i fully understand Sam's anger. He's the asshole but not a huge one", "No.", "Well that title seems a bit misleading as it implies you're not giving your kids anything when intact you \nare.\n\nINFO\n\nFirst you mention john worked for only 4 months then quit but then during the dinner you mentioned he only worked for a few years at your company then left.\n\n\nSo which one is it? 4 months or a few years???", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
