I have been growing it for the better part of three decades, however, my wife and I agreed that we have more than enough for me to retire and so I am.\n\nSome backstory: Back when John was in high school I gave him a job at my business, and soon after he started he asked if I could give his friend Sam (32M, now, 17 when he started) a job as well. John was not interested in the work and quit after 4 months, and I will whole heartedly admit that that was very painful at the time, but Sam loved the job. He continued to work throughout college where he went into the same field as me, and I gave him a promotion when he completed his studies. Sam is very much my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I see him as my second son. John studied finance and, after working at some other places, asked me if I could give him a job. I did and he's extremely good at what he does. I love the fact that I get to work with the both of them.\n\nI took my wife, John, Susan and Sam out to dinner last week to tell them my plan for retirement. Sam will take my place and own 60% while John and Susan would each get 20%. I have never seen John so furious. He asked how I could choose Sam over him, my own flesh and blood. He also said he's the one who studied running businesses and that he should be the one in charge. I told him that he has only worked for me for a few years and already quit once, whereas Sam has been working for me for 15 years, knows all the clients, the products and the production team, and has their respect. He then I asked if he had my respect and I told him of course, he's the best at what he does, but that doesn't mean he's the best fit for being the boss. My wife and Susan tried deescalating the situation but John left in huff and hasn't been talking to anyone but Susan since.\n\nI know John's hurt, but Sam is the better choice since he's been working directly under me for years and knows the ins and outs better than anyone but me. I've tried talking to John and apologizing, but he won't let me. AITA?\n\nedit: Some people keep asking why I gave Susan the same amount and what her relation to the business is. She's worked off and on as a contractor and, especially since she has kids of her own, I wanted to give her some financial stability. It's the same with John, as he's never expressed any interest in running the place and came back to work for me because he got laid off and had a hard time finding another job, I wanted to ensure some financial stability for him while making sure Sam was the one in charge.\n\nedit 2: First a point of clarity: nothing has actually been signed yet and I'm still in charge. Susan came to the house and we just had a long discussion. She's been talking with John and she told me he feels like this is me telling John that Sam is my real son. I asked her if she felt the same way. She doesn't but she sees how it looks to John. I then asked her what she thinks I should do, and she told me I should lower her share and give it to John. She said he would rather give him the money then watch him disappear from the family. I also asked if she knew whether he actually wanted and/or expected to run the business. And as far as she knew he didn't and was surprised at how poorly he reacted. Before she left I asked her to try and get him to have a conversation about this and she told me, \"sure, but don't count on it being soon.\" ", "created_utc": 1681064606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gr7ej/aita_for_leaving_my_business_to_my_prot\u00e9g\u00e9/", "score": 536, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be obvious to most people that this should be a conversation to have over a long period of time, individually with each of the three concerned parties. Announcing the completed decision was bound to set off some unpredictable feelings.\n\nBest solution as I see it would have been to *sell* the business, at a below market value, to the three of them in exactly the proportions you suggested. But only after individually explaining your plan to each of them & getting their feedback (starting with Susan because she's the one most removed from the business, but most likely to be able to predict her brother's reaction), and tweaking the plan based on their input.\n\nBut now, you've created a rift between them and it will be incredibly difficult for them to operate as partners.

It\u2019s a business and the honest answer is, Sam will be better at running it and taking care of it. He knows the business and the work. My money is on John selling it in a year because his heart isn\u2019t in it or cutting sam out because he\u2019s jealous. \nJohn isn\u2019t entitled to a thing", "The very fact that John believes that the blood relationship should factor into the management of the business is proof that he is not the right person to own it.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Still, this is your legacy you built, and you should absolutely leave it for the person you have the most faith in keeping it alive.\n\nThere is a fair chance you will no longer have a relationship with your son again.

John has a right to feel like he\u2019s been replaced by his (former) friend in your eyes.", "Just wondering how you gave the business.\nSounds like Sam now owns the business and has full control.

At that age many kids buck against what their parents do or want - its totally normal. So Im not surprised he left. BUT he came back. He studied something that would add value to the business and he came back and worked for you.\n\nSecondly: You are giving Susan  -- who did absolutely nothing for the business, equal share to John who has been working for you and contributing to the business. How is that fair?\n\nLastly: Sam may have worked for you all these years and may know all the ins and outs of the business, however at no point did you ever have a conversation with John (and Susan ) about leaving the business to Sam, so it would be a natural conclusion that you would be leaving this business that you have built up, to your own children.\n\nIs there any way you can leave the ownership of the business to John and Susan equally BUT with a clause that Sam is to run it or be in charge of it for however long he wants? Something like that?\n\nIf you had done this to me, I wouldnt be hurt, Id be quitting the business and opening up a rival business and putting yours in the ground. Nor would I be speaking to you again.

Now, it's likely that my son-in-law will take it over. Again, we TALKED about it. I think YTA for not talking about it, and I think you're being unfair to your son, judging him based on high school behaviour. He's currently working for you and you said he's doing a good job. Why are you giving your son the same shares as your daughter, who seems to have had nothing to do with the company?

This is possibly a conversation you should have had with your son a long, long, time ago. \n\nIs it possible that your son has been under the wrong impression for many years? Is it possible this could have been avoided by having a simple, but uncomfortable, conversation years ago? Have you ever explicitly let him know that he should follow his own life path, and that you expect him to make the bulk of his own money? It sounds silly but if you have given up things, made compromises based on an outcome that you assumed was assured, it would be absolutely infuriating to learn otherwise at the last hour. \n\nOf course, it is perfectly reasonable that you chose the best candidate for the future of your business.", "INFO:\n\nWhen you son asked for a job, was it because he had an interest in eventually running it?\n\nHas he shown any interest in running it?\n\nHow long has he worked there now?\n\nHad you taken the time to discuss his interest in taking over the family business prior to your decision?\n\nHas Susan shown any interest in the company? Has she ever worked there?\n\nAny particular reason why Susan would get the same amount of shares as your son?\n\nAs for your opinion on his decision not to work there when he was a teenager, to me it's completely understandable that your son didn't want to follow in the family business *when he was a teenager*, so holding his decision against him feels a bit harsh.\n\nMy question on that last part then is very basic. Is it possible your son didn't come back to the business because of how hurt you were when he decided to go about his life without you? Did you perhaps place a stigma on the notion of him returning to work for you which inevitably caused him to not return so quickly after college?", "NTA. I completely understand your decision. Your son should be glad that you give him something, not to cry that someone else, who actually deserves more, gets more.", " YTA- because John did sacrifice more than Sam. And way more than Susan. Being the child of an entrepreneur is hard. I know I am one. The amount of sacrifices families make and the stress the family takes on when business is slow is immeasurable.

(self.AmItheAsshole)\n\nsubmitted 3 hours ago * by Flaky_Arugula_167\n\nI (58M) have two kids, John (32M) and Susan (29F), and I started a business back in my late twenties after they were born. I have been growing it for the better part of three decades, however, my wife and I agreed that we have more than enough for me to retire and so I am.\n\nSome backstory: Back when John was in high school I gave him a job at my business, and soon after he started he asked if I could give his friend Sam (32M, now, 17 when he started) a job as well. John was not interested in the work and quit after 4 months, and I will whole heartedly admit that that was very painful at the time, but Sam loved the job. He continued to work throughout college where he went into the same field as me, and I gave him a promotion when he completed his studies. Sam is very much my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I see him as my second son. John studied finance and, after working at some other places, asked me if I could give him a job. I did and he's extremely good at what he does. I love the fact that I get to work with the both of them.\n\nI took my wife, John, Susan and Sam out to dinner last week to tell them my plan for retirement. Sam will take my place and own 60% while John and Susan would each get 20%. I have never seen John so furious. He asked how I could choose Sam over him, my own flesh and blood. He also said he's the one who studied running businesses and that he should be the one in charge. I told him that he has only worked for me for a few years and already quit once, whereas Sam has been working for me for 15 years, knows all the clients, the products and the production team, and has their respect. He then I asked if he had my respect and I told him of course, he's the best at what he does, but that doesn't mean he's the best fit for being the boss. My wife and Susan tried deescalating the situation but John left in huff and hasn't been talking to anyone but Susan since.\n\nI know John's hurt, but Sam is the better choice since he's been working directly under me for years and knows the ins and outs better than anyone but me. I've tried talking to John and apologizing, but he won't let me. AITA?\n\nedit: Some people keep asking why I gave Susan the same amount and what her relation to the business is. She's worked off and on as a contractor and, especially since she has kids of her own, I wanted to give her some financial stability. It's the same with John, as he's never expressed any interest in running the place and came back to work for me because he got laid off and had a hard time finding another job, I wanted to ensure some financial stability for him while making sure Sam was the one in charge.", "ESH - to be clear, there's nothing wrong with leaving the business to whoever you want. It's your business, and your kids are grown adults who aren't entitled to any of it. And you have an obligation not only to your family but also to your employees, and if Sam will do a better job with the business, you have to look out for them to. Your son also seems entitled. \n\nThat being said, you get an ESH because it seems like you went about it the worst possible way, especially when I don't understand why it's necessary? You could've retired and left Sam in charge, while keeping ownership of the business. No reason why you can't be retired and the owner. That would've allowed you to push this decision off, possibly decades, to see how both Sam and John did with the company longer term. Instead, you locked into this decision now, which seems I'll advised. You also should've spent more time talking to them individually.", "Make a deal to sell the company to Sam, maybe a down payment and money pd monthly until the price is paid off. Then your son and wife can get their inheritance (in due time of course).", "I don\u2019t agree with everyone saying your daughter should get less than your son. My only question in this is why couldn\u2019t you split it 33/33/34 if that\u2019s what it\u2019ll take to keep Sam in charge? Did Sam really need to get three times more than your own offspring? And this is about inheritance, why did you announce this to your children and Sam at the same time?", "NTA but personally I would have given more a 40 , 30, 30 split that way it is a needed 2/3 vote to do anything massive I the business but still keeping the person 'in charge' who is running day to day who has the most intrest of the company at heart. They way you have done it means your kids have no control and under 50% between them so no veto power and essentially losing it as the family business ans gives them no security.", "NTA", "YTA.  This is a family asset, and you are gifting it to an employee for no apparent reason whatsoever.  You are clearly confused about management vs. ownership.  If you own a business and you have a good employee or manager, you keep them as a manager.  If you have family, they inherit the ownership of that business regardless of who is selected to as manager.  By your same logic, if you have $1 million in the bank and you like the bank manager, then the bank manager should inherit 60% of the $1 million.  This is a bunch of ridiculous nonsense.  If you want to cut your children off and gift the family business to an employee, be a man and tell them your cutting them off.  If I was your son I would tell you, respectfully, I don't want the damn 20%, and don't even put my name in your will.", "Control and ownership are not necessarily the same thing.\n\nThink about how much your business is worth, I don't know how much that is, $100,000, half a million, 5 million, 10 million, whatever it is. Most parents usually leave their inheritance to their children or family members. Now imagine you didn't own a business, but had that same dollar amount in the bank and then announced randomly to your children that you were giving 60% of it away to your protege at work. However you think they would feel about that, is at least partially how they feel now.\n\nYou could give your protege 20% and each of the kids 40% but with provisions that your protege is in charge. Maybe his shares have 10 times voting rights or something, talk to your lawyer, they are hopefully smart and you probably pay them a lot of money. Giving him a sizable chunk of ownership does actually seem like a good idea so that he is motivated to keep the company growing and profitable so giving him a percentage like that is actually a boon to your kids in this case.\n\nNow if they're upset about control, that's another question that's a little more difficult, but the fact that you've pre given away a large chunk of their inheritance probably does rub them the wrong way.", "This is so very similar to this other thread! https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g5ktm/aita_for_calling_my_son_ridiculous_for_asking_me/\n\nI feel the same way about both situations.

But by mixing up questions 1 and 2 you've really screwed things up with your son. Honestly, this may be irrecoverable at this point, but if it weren't I would focus on assigning an appropriate value to the business, creating a circumstance wherein Sam can buy in and lead it, but (eventually) giving the value of the business to your children. Because you're retiring, another approach might be to continue to own the business and it's profits and have Sam run it.

There might be enough hurt feelings building over years of being second to completely sever op from their biological son. It would definitely have gone over a lot better if he had been talking to his son first about this instead of springing it on him. He might even be thinking op loves the suck up friend more than he loves his own son. Although I hope that when op gets old, his second son will be taking care of him. His son more than likely won't be. We are not entitled to inheritances, but they sure make good incentives to care for crotchety old relatives.
