{"id": 14388, "submission_id": "12gr7ej", "title": "AITA for leaving my business to my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 instead of my children?", "selftext": "I (58M) have two kids, John (32M) and Susan (29F), and I started a business back in my late twenties after they were born. I have been growing it for the better part of three decades, however, my wife and I agreed that we have more than enough for me to retire and so I am.\n\nSome backstory: Back when John was in high school I gave him a job at my business, and soon after he started he asked if I could give his friend Sam (32M, now, 17 when he started) a job as well. John was not interested in the work and quit after 4 months, and I will whole heartedly admit that that was very painful at the time, but Sam loved the job. He continued to work throughout college where he went into the same field as me, and I gave him a promotion when he completed his studies. Sam is very much my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I see him as my second son. John studied finance and, after working at some other places, asked me if I could give him a job. I did and he's extremely good at what he does. I love the fact that I get to work with the both of them.\n\nI took my wife, John, Susan and Sam out to dinner last week to tell them my plan for retirement. Sam will take my place and own 60% while John and Susan would each get 20%. I have never seen John so furious. He asked how I could choose Sam over him, my own flesh and blood. He also said he's the one who studied running businesses and that he should be the one in charge. I told him that he has only worked for me for a few years and already quit once, whereas Sam has been working for me for 15 years, knows all the clients, the products and the production team, and has their respect. He then I asked if he had my respect and I told him of course, he's the best at what he does, but that doesn't mean he's the best fit for being the boss. My wife and Susan tried deescalating the situation but John left in huff and hasn't been talking to anyone but Susan since.\n\nI know John's hurt, but Sam is the better choice since he's been working directly under me for years and knows the ins and outs better than anyone but me. I've tried talking to John and apologizing, but he won't let me. AITA?\n\nedit: Some people keep asking why I gave Susan the same amount and what her relation to the business is. She's worked off and on as a contractor and, especially since she has kids of her own, I wanted to give her some financial stability. It's the same with John, as he's never expressed any interest in running the place and came back to work for me because he got laid off and had a hard time finding another job, I wanted to ensure some financial stability for him while making sure Sam was the one in charge.\n\nedit 2: First a point of clarity: nothing has actually been signed yet and I'm still in charge. Susan came to the house and we just had a long discussion. She's been talking with John and she told me he feels like this is me telling John that Sam is my real son. I asked her if she felt the same way. She doesn't but she sees how it looks to John. I then asked her what she thinks I should do, and she told me I should lower her share and give it to John. She said he would rather give him the money then watch him disappear from the family. I also asked if she knew whether he actually wanted and/or expected to run the business. And as far as she knew he didn't and was surprised at how poorly he reacted. Before she left I asked her to try and get him to have a conversation about this and she told me, \"sure, but don't count on it being soon.\"\n\nEdit 3: I am sick of all the comments saying I don't care about my kids. My wife doesn't see it that way. My daughter doesn't see it that way. Yes, I wasn't always present in their lives and, yes, my business did take priority at times, but I did my absolute damnedest to be there as much as I possibly could. I made time for graduations, sports events, and other big milestones and events as best I could and I was there for most of them. I may not have been present at all times, but I did my best to try to be. \n\nAlso, Sam is not a \"complete stranger\"", "created_utc": 1681064606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gr7ej/aita_for_leaving_my_business_to_my_prot\u00e9g\u00e9/", "score": 1791, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But only after individually explaining your plan to each of them & getting their feedback (starting with Susan because she's the one most removed from the business, but most likely to be able to predict her brother's reaction), and tweaking the plan based on their input.\n\nBut now, you've created a rift between them and it will be incredibly difficult for them to operate as partners.

It\u2019s a business and the honest answer is, Sam will be better at running it and taking care of it. He knows the business and the work.

At that age many kids buck against what their parents do or want - its totally normal. So Im not surprised he left. BUT he came back. He studied something that would add value to the business and he came back and worked for you.\n\nSecondly: You are giving Susan  -- who did absolutely nothing for the business, equal share to John who has been working for you and contributing to the business. How is that fair?\n\nLastly: Sam may have worked for you all these years and may know all the ins and outs of the business, however at no point did you ever have a conversation with John (and Susan ) about leaving the business to Sam, so it would be a natural conclusion that you would be leaving this business that you have built up, to your own children.\n\nIs there any way you can leave the ownership of the business to John and Susan equally BUT with a clause that Sam is to run it or be in charge of it for however long he wants? Something like that?\n\nIf you had done this to me, I wouldnt be hurt, Id be quitting the business and opening up a rival business and putting yours in the ground. Nor would I be speaking to you again.

Now, it's likely that my son-in-law will take it over. Again, we TALKED about it. I think YTA for not talking about it, and I think you're being unfair to your son, judging him based on high school behaviour. He's currently working for you and you said he's doing a good job. Why are you giving your son the same shares as your daughter, who seems to have had nothing to do with the company?

This is possibly a conversation you should have had with your son a long, long, time ago. \n\nIs it possible that your son has been under the wrong impression for many years? Is it possible this could have been avoided by having a simple, but uncomfortable, conversation years ago? Have you ever explicitly let him know that he should follow his own life path, and that you expect him to make the bulk of his own money? It sounds silly but if you have given up things, made compromises based on an outcome that you assumed was assured, it would be absolutely infuriating to learn otherwise at the last hour. \n\nOf course, it is perfectly reasonable that you chose the best candidate for the future of your business.", "INFO:\n\nWhen you son asked for a job, was it because he had an interest in eventually running it?\n\nHas he shown any interest in running it?\n\nHow long has he worked there now?\n\nHad you taken the time to discuss his interest in taking over the family business prior to your decision?\n\nHas Susan shown any interest in the company?

Is it possible your son didn't come back to the business because of how hurt you were when he decided to go about his life without you? Did you perhaps place a stigma on the notion of him returning to work for you which inevitably caused him to not return so quickly after college?", "NTA. I completely understand your decision.

(self.AmItheAsshole)\n\nsubmitted 3 hours ago * by Flaky_Arugula_167\n\nI (58M) have two kids, John (32M) and Susan (29F), and I started a business back in my late twenties after they were born. I have been growing it for the better part of three decades, however, my wife and I agreed that we have more than enough for me to retire and so I am.\n\nSome backstory: Back when John was in high school I gave him a job at my business, and soon after he started he asked if I could give his friend Sam (32M, now, 17 when he started) a job as well. John was not interested in the work and quit after 4 months, and I will whole heartedly admit that that was very painful at the time, but Sam loved the job. He continued to work throughout college where he went into the same field as me, and I gave him a promotion when he completed his studies. Sam is very much my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and I see him as my second son. John studied finance and, after working at some other places, asked me if I could give him a job. I did and he's extremely good at what he does. I love the fact that I get to work with the both of them.\n\nI took my wife, John, Susan and Sam out to dinner last week to tell them my plan for retirement. Sam will take my place and own 60% while John and Susan would each get 20%. I have never seen John so furious. He asked how I could choose Sam over him, my own flesh and blood. He also said he's the one who studied running businesses and that he should be the one in charge. I told him that he has only worked for me for a few years and already quit once, whereas Sam has been working for me for 15 years, knows all the clients, the products and the production team, and has their respect. He then I asked if he had my respect and I told him of course, he's the best at what he does, but that doesn't mean he's the best fit for being the boss. My wife and Susan tried deescalating the situation but John left in huff and hasn't been talking to anyone but Susan since.\n\nI know John's hurt, but Sam is the better choice since he's been working directly under me for years and knows the ins and outs better than anyone but me. I've tried talking to John and apologizing, but he won't let me. AITA?\n\nedit: Some people keep asking why I gave Susan the same amount and what her relation to the business is. She's worked off and on as a contractor and, especially since she has kids of her own, I wanted to give her some financial stability. It's the same with John, as he's never expressed any interest in running the place and came back to work for me because he got laid off and had a hard time finding another job, I wanted to ensure some financial stability for him while making sure Sam was the one in charge.", "ESH - to be clear, there's nothing wrong with leaving the business to whoever you want. It's your business, and your kids are grown adults who aren't entitled to any of it. And you have an obligation not only to your family but also to your employees, and if Sam will do a better job with the business, you have to look out for them to. Your son also seems entitled. \n\nThat being said, you get an ESH because it seems like you went about it the worst possible way, especially when I don't understand why it's necessary? You could've retired and left Sam in charge, while keeping ownership of the business. No reason why you can't be retired and the owner. That would've allowed you to push this decision off, possibly decades, to see how both Sam and John did with the company longer term. Instead, you locked into this decision now, which seems I'll advised. You also should've spent more time talking to them individually.", "Make a deal to sell the company to Sam, maybe a down payment and money pd monthly until the price is paid off. Then your son and wife can get their inheritance (in due time of course).", "I don\u2019t agree with everyone saying your daughter should get less than your son. My only question in this is why couldn\u2019t you split it 33/33/34 if that\u2019s what it\u2019ll take to keep Sam in charge? Did Sam really need to get three times more than your own offspring? And this is about inheritance, why did you announce this to your children and Sam at the same time?", "NTA but personally I would have given more a 40 , 30, 30 split that way it is a needed 2/3 vote to do anything massive I the business but still keeping the person 'in charge' who is running day to day who has the most intrest of the company at heart. They way you have done it means your kids have no control and under 50% between them so no veto power and essentially losing it as the family business ans gives them no security.", "NTA", "YTA.  This is a family asset, and you are gifting it to an employee for no apparent reason whatsoever.  You are clearly confused about management vs. ownership.  If you own a business and you have a good employee or manager, you keep them as a manager.  If you have family, they inherit the ownership of that business regardless of who is selected to as manager.  By your same logic, if you have $1 million in the bank and you like the bank manager, then the bank manager should inherit 60% of the $1 million.  This is a bunch of ridiculous nonsense.  If you want to cut your children off and gift the family business to an employee, be a man and tell them your cutting them off.  If I was your son I would tell you, respectfully, I don't want the damn 20%, and don't even put my name in your will.", "Control and ownership are not necessarily the same thing.\n\nThink about how much your business is worth, I don't know how much that is, $100,000, half a million, 5 million, 10 million, whatever it is. Most parents usually leave their inheritance to their children or family members. Now imagine you didn't own a business, but had that same dollar amount in the bank and then announced randomly to your children that you were giving 60% of it away to your protege at work. However you think they would feel about that, is at least partially how they feel now.\n\nYou could give your protege 20% and each of the kids 40% but with provisions that your protege is in charge. Maybe his shares have 10 times voting rights or something, talk to your lawyer, they are hopefully smart and you probably pay them a lot of money. Giving him a sizable chunk of ownership does actually seem like a good idea so that he is motivated to keep the company growing and profitable so giving him a percentage like that is actually a boon to your kids in this case.\n\nNow if they're upset about control, that's another question that's a little more difficult, but the fact that you've pre given away a large chunk of their inheritance probably does rub them the wrong way.", "This is so very similar to this other thread! https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g5ktm/aita_for_calling_my_son_ridiculous_for_asking_me/\n\nI feel the same way about both situations.

But by mixing up questions 1 and 2 you've really screwed things up with your son. Honestly, this may be irrecoverable at this point, but if it weren't I would focus on assigning an appropriate value to the business, creating a circumstance wherein Sam can buy in and lead it, but (eventually) giving the value of the business to your children. Because you're retiring, another approach might be to continue to own the business and it's profits and have Sam run it. You'd probably need to enable him to buy some portion of it.\n\nYou should discuss these issues with a financial planner and a lawyer.\n\nI'm sorry to say that I agree with the YTA votes, as I know you meant to do what you felt was best. But the points others have made that you lack emotional intelligence in the way that you broke this to your son are correct.

Sam can still be in charge and get a stake, but damn 60% ouch. That was John's friend he brought in, this would be hurtful to anyone. I agree the way he reacted was bad, but I can't even imagine his shock.", "He hasnt he said so in a comment", "Exactly. His children are more likely to have financial stability through the business if someone who knows the ins and outs of it is running it, rather than him giving it to his child(ren) who would be more likely to run it into the ground.", "And what's this Sam isn't family and was originally no more than a friend of Johns bullshit?\n\nMy girlfriend was originally a stranger I had never met. Anyone who thinks family is bound by blood relation is an idiot, if OP considers Sam as a second son then Sam is his family.", "Thank you for that nuanced and well thought out counter argument.", "Yeah, I'm kinda upset seeing a lot of these comments. There's employees at stake here who trust OP and for him to make the best choices for the company. \n\nThe person actually working diligently for a long period of time should be the one to get the position, not the one that's just related to the owner.", "Wondering if John\u2019s unconscious feelings around Sam have anything to do with his big reaction/feeling like OP \u201cchose\u201d Sam over him? \n\nI could see John having been a bit jealous of Sam\u2019s closeness with his dad over the years\u2026? \n\nAnd/or I could see John as being perhaps a bit pompous about it all (bc of that envy, or for some other reason) and having thought of Sam as \u201cjust the help\u201d, or as beneath John somehow? So it\u2019s an insult to John\u2019s pride/ego that the lowly worker, \u201cwho only got the job because of me\u201d, actually earned enough respect from dad to be a threat/oust the \u201crightful heir\u201d/blood son? \n\nOr maybe both? And a dash of whatever else is going on in John\u2019s head? \n\nIdk, I get how things not turning out as John would\u2019ve hoped could feel really challenging to him, but jeepers, I feel for Sam in all this!? Dude poured 15 years of his life and spent years in school to progress towards what he likely thought was a solid career (whether or not he ever considered the possibility of actually inheriting the business) and now he\u2019s faced with potentially having to choose between his dear friendship and the career he\u2019s worked so hard for? And it might even be that there\u2019s no friendship to salvage, if John was truly so self-important as to subconsciously think less of Sam because of something as arbitrary/unmerited as genetics, and now no matter what happens, his job is inexorably tied to someone who thinks he\u2019s owed more because of nothing more than having been born to OP?  \n\nWonder what Sam thinks of all this? \n\nSure hope everyone can get humble and work through this with empathy and compassion.", "How is it screwing over his children if they each get 20% while sitting on their asses while the other guy does all the work?", "You\u2019re 100% right and most people here never worked in private sector. Make Sam CEO, sure, but keep ownership in the family. Everyone acting like running the company and owning the company is the same thing", "Stuff like that mostly happened in situations where there weren't kids or the protege got part ownership.\n\nVery rarely did companies change ownership stakes while children were involved etc.  \n\nPartnerships happened a lot.  But change in majority owner outside the family was rare.  \n\nThat's how the billionaire families all starter and now they run things like.", "Will Sam come visit you in the retirement home when you\u2019re old? Your kids certainly won\u2019t if you do this to them.", "My pleasure \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "It's confusing that you conflate control/running a business with owning it.  He can still be a highly paid CEO. You can even give him a share (I'd do 5 or 10%) as a nice gesture.  But he doesn't have to have ownership to run it", "Nope, fuck that.  This would allow John and Susan to throw a fucking fit and sell the company out from under Sam.  Any discussions regarding future equity should involve Sam directly.", "I don't have any particular opinions on the situation, it just rubs me wrong that this commenter called Sam a suck up. Dude wasn't a suck up, he was grateful for the job and worked his ass off to show it & progress.", "I\u2019m guessing that OP was imagining a retirement spent in the company of his loving family\u2026 I suspect the regardless of the outcome, this has created a very large rift in the father-son relationship (likely with the son thinking he\u2019s been \u201creplaced\u201d by Sam). I\u2019m not sure if this relationship will survive this.", "Then why did he have kids at all? He should have just found a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to bring into the business he spent so much time on.", "This is not an inheritance, this is the running of company with presumably other employees too , by placing it in the hands of who he thinks is the most competent to run it and by giving Sam the majority of the shares, he guarantees that the two children wont push Sam out after OP is gone and appoint themselves as CEO. This is a good and fair decision both for the business and its other employees.  \n\nBy giving them 20% each John and Sue will receive their share of the profits of the company without even needing to work for it and on top pf that will certainly inherit the other assets owned by OP when he passes , that will be their inheritance. \n\nJohn\u2019s outburst and threat to abandon the family so much so that his sister is now willing to forgo her share simply to appease him, doesnt speak well of his character.  NTA OP, your son has shown what sort of mettle he is made of.", "family owned businesses ar just like every other company profit is there bottom line john given the chance will sell the company to finally have some money to fuck all", "Lmaoooo who knew you would have to say, inheritance is not about qualification.", "It\u2019s *not* an inheritance- the OP isn\u2019t dead. He is passing his business on. When he kicks the bucket sometime down the road, I doubt Sam will be getting a share of his home or savings or be a beneficiary on his life insurance.", "> Inheritance is not about qualification. \n\nNo its not, but then this isn't strictly inheritance - its succession planning within a business where the owner does what is in the best interests of maintaining and growing the business.  Beyond having a job in the business, from what the OP wrote, John doesn't appear to have an interest in the core product of the business.\n\nWhat the OP's children will inherit when OP dies will be their inheritance and by the sounds of it, it will probably be a lot.", "This is exactly what's going to happen, and Sam could laugh all the way to the bank. \n\nAnd all these other \"NTA\" voters are going to go \"b-b-but it wasn't inheritance if OP gives it away before his death!!!!1!!\" even though I guarantee they'd be pissed if their parents gave their mortgage-free house to the neighbor kid.", "Is your business really more important than your family?\n\nThink several comments already gave you alternatives to keep Sam running the business but maintaining the company in the family. \n\nAlso regarding John, it\u2019s very complicated to work for your own father, & seems it didn\u2019t work out so well when he worked there as a teenager - you don\u2019t really clarify what happened - therefore not surprised it wasn\u2019t his 1st choice after college. Then to just compare John & Sam in equal terms seems a bit unfair.", ">OP\u2019s priority is the welfare of the business rather than his kids.\n\nYou do realise the two are connected, right?", "It\u2019s *not* inheritance. OP isn\u2019t dead or dying. He is passing on control of the business to someone else who is passionate about the business and most likely to keep us successful. His children were not entitled to become to leaders of the business, nor had they ever shown interest in becoming the COOs. Sam has helped the business be a success. The 20% each adult kid is getting is likely to be a much higher dollar amount with Sam running it than if either of them suddenly took over. They both will still have whatever jobs they otherwise had. They weren\u2019t getting 20% before! Now they are.", "When it comes to his business he\u2019s a boss first, dad second. It\u2019s the son that is unable to see that. The two are only connected because the son expects endless handouts. That\u2019s not a good quality to have as a ceo."]}
