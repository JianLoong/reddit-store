{"id": 5653, "submission_id": "zvdq9f", "title": "AITA for kicking family out on Christmas over what they said to my daughter?", "selftext": "I (48F) and my husband (48M) have two children: Randy (22M) and Eve (19F). Eve was diagnosed with autism when she was in elementary school. She does school online currently, and can do some basic tasks by herself, but me and my husband have to do a lot for her (cook for her, drive her places, etc.) She recently started doing her own laundry, which we're very proud of her for, but it took like four years of learning and encouragement. We love her and know we'll have to care for her. \n\nEve loves toys. She especially likes dolls and little interactive animal toys. For Christmas, we had my parents, my two sisters and their husbands, my one sister's 15 year old daughter, and my mom's sister and her husband. \n\nRandy got a few games he wanted, plus a new laptop he needs for his classes next semester. Eve got dolls, a small dollhouse, some pajamas, some stuffed animals, and the big gift was a interactive horse toy that you can braid the hair of and things. Eve was overjoyed, and played with it up until it was time for lunch. \n\nI didn't notice anything before, but at lunch, my mom was looking over at my sister, Brianna, and her daughter, Marissa, like they had done something wrong. I helped my daughter get a plate of food, got her a juice box, and went to get my own food. I then heard yelling and my daughter crying and went back to the table. Turns out Marissa had told Eve she's childish and shouldn't want toys anymore, and needs to grow up, and my sisters both agreed! Marissa told her that she should be braiding her own hair instead of a toy's fake hair, and make herself pretty instead of making a toy pretty. My mom and my father were horrified, and they had apparently heard Marissa and Brianna express this earlier and told them they were being insensitive and will be in trouble if they tell me, my husband, or Eve that. Randy, the great brother he is, took Eve away from the situation and up to her room to calm down. \n\nI, as calmly as possible, explained for the millionth time that Eve is autistic, her brain works differently, and if you were with her daily, you would see that her toys actually help her learn social skills, regulate her emotions, and calm her down. Brianna then said that I \"baby\" her too much. We make meals for her, get her food, buy her toys, and drive her everywhere, when we should just \"force\" her to learn on her own. Brianna said that because she does school, she's \"normal enough to live on her own\" (the exact words). I told Brianna, Marissa, and Brianna's husband to leave. My other sister and her husband tried to defend them, saying that if I just \"cut the cord\" Eve would learn how to survive. I told them to leave too. \n\nMy husband is with me, as is my father, but my mother said I took it too far by kicking them out and saying I'm never letting them around Eve again. They really hurt Eve Luckily she's still playing with her toys, so they didn't seem to ruin her love of them, but she's been sad and crying all day. I just put her to bed and started crying myself once she wasn't able to see me do it. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Added names instead of just initials. Fake names, of course, but hopefully it's easier to follow now. Addressing some common concerns: \n\n-I got Eve her food because she has pretty severe motor delays- she's about on the level of a five year old. Normally I try to let her get her own food, and if she makes a mess I clean it up, but since there were platters of food (think buffet style on a kitchen counter) that if she spilled would make a hazard on the kitchen floor where people could slip (and my mom has had two knee replacements, so if she slips...that would've ruined Christmas even more). Her making a mess while eating isn't a worry because I can clean it later and nobody is going to be walking under the table to slip on it. \n\n-We've worked with specialists since Eve's diagnosis to figure out the right way to both care for her and foster independence. From some testing last year, specialists believe Eve is at the level of a 4 or 5 year old socially, 5 years old motor skills, and academically 14- the problem is she doesn't appear to have the cognitive ability to apply what she learns in school to the real word- for example, Eve could read a book and identify a character is mean because they don't understand, but she can only understand that my sisters and her cousin are mean, but not really why. Her language fluctuates from non-verbal, to verbal with the language capability of 2 year old, to verbal with the language capability of a 5 year old. Her academic ability is an outlier, but the specialists don't seem too alarmed by it, so we aren't either.", "created_utc": 1672024497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvdq9f/aita_for_kicking_family_out_on_christmas_over/", "score": 4181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ask your doctor for advise with regard to specialists in areas that would benefit Eve. Have you ever considered letting your sisters spend a day with Eve to help them understand her strengths and limitations? Have they had opportunities to tend Eve as you and your husband do on a full time basis? Maybe if they had to experience it, they would not be quick to judge your choices. Good luck to all of you.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry about your ignorant and insensitive family members.  They owe you an apology.", "NTA.  You did good protecting your daughter and that will matter much more in the long run in your household and to your daughter. \n\nAlso what in the world is wrong with a 19 year old regardless of their circumstances wanting to play with toys.  Sounds like a very boring life if at 19(or any age really) suddenly the toys just get cut off forever.\n\nAny chance the ones who made the comments about your daughter and the toys and such is jealous of your daughter?\n\nAlso its good to teach any child about stuff like housework and not just cutting them out to learn on their own as was suggested.", "NTA. My 2 eldest are ASD also, and I would have thrown hands, so you are definitely one up on me. Lol\n\nI've cut contact with my family over the same types of issues.\n\nYou sound like you're doing everything you can to gelp Eve. I hope she perks up soon and forgets her cousin being awful.", "Obviously NTA\n\nI think people who do not live with a developmentally delayed person really do not get what it is like. They think maybe the person just needs some extra tutoring because they learn slowly. They imagine something like their own brain, only you have to work a little harder or longer to do the same things. They don't get that this other person's brain is wired very differently from theirs and that there are things they cannot do no matter how hard they try. \n\nWe need so many more parents' accounts and first-hand accounts from autistic people because that is the only way to understand what \"autism\" is really like, instead of what outsiders think it is.", "Thank you.  Exactly.  I can't believe what I just read.", "Here is my poor person award \ud83e\udd47\nThese parents are following the experts \n\nNTA \n\nGood for you OP \n\nI've worked with autistic children in a setting and  not all autistic people have the same needs.\nI'm glad you are doing what your child needs.

I\u2019m glad someone could advocate for your kid. I\u2019m autistic, although admittedly \u201chigh functioning\u201d, and even I would be delighted by a dolls house. My mum also has to cut some food for me because it\u2019s just too difficult. I\u2019m glad Eve had people who will do the same for her.\nThose who said you baby her clearly don\u2019t care enough to know anything about her and need to grow up and learn that not everyone is the same. End of story. Keep sticking up for your girl and don\u2019t listen to anyone who tells you you\u2019re wrong unless they can show you a medical document proving what they say", "My best friend has an autistic child.  I have often thought that she is handling things with great love and sacrifice but not great outcomes.  I would do things very differently.  I have never told her this.  I don't live with her.  I don't know her struggles.  I trust that she has made the very best choices she could with the information she has.  My job is to support her and encourage her.  \n\nKeep on doing your best for your child.  Maybe your are right, maybe other people are right.  You can only do your best and it is clear that you are.  Your daughter is lucky to have you as parents.  No one knows your child as well as you do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nI'm proud of you, mama bear.  I have one on the spectrum, and I would have needed bail money if someone said that crap.  Good for you!", "NTA here at all. Your sister and niece are though. I\u2019m autistic and in my 30s and still have my plushies at my house. If someone wants to come in and tell me I\u2019m not enough of an adult they can go get bent. You sound like a good mom and you\u2019re doing a good job protecting your daughter and your reaction was completely appropriate to the circumstances.", "NTA.  Your situation makes me angry for you and your daughter.  A long time ago I was in an argument with someone (actually my boss) who said something which boggled the heck out of me.  I believe my response, although completely inappropriate for my situation, would have been awesome in yours.\n\n\u201cWhat, are you stupid or something?\u201d", "Bravo!  You are raising your daughter the best way you know how!  I am happy that your husband supports you.  Of your sisters, ignorance is not a permit to butt in and be mean.", "Good job momma!! I will cut off the entire world including my own mother if they hurt my child! The family we CREATE will always be more important than the one we come from.", "NTA but I would let them see her one more time if they want to say that they are sorry", "NTA!!!!", "NTA. I have no words for the situation. I'm just floored.\nSuper glad to hear you, hubby, and some extended family is being super supportive and protective of Eve! Keep up the awesome work!\n\nNever apologize for doing what is good to take care of your family. Merry Christmas!", ">she has my number\n\nMost phones these days do have caller ID.  Tell yourself this: it's okay to not answer the phone when she calls.  Let it go to voice-mail, which you don't even have to listen to if you don't want to.  (Listen long enough to know it's not an emergency, then stop the playback.)  \n\n\nIt's okay to look after your own interests.    \nAnd hang in there, you *can* do this.", "Also autistic adult here, and I also do a lot of \u201cnormal\u201d adult things, but it\u2019s harder than it looks.
