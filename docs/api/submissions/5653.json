E was diagnosed with autism when she was in elementary school. She does school online currently, and can do some basic tasks by herself, but me and my husband have to do a lot for her (cook for her, drive her places, etc.) She recently started doing her own laundry, which we're very proud of her for, but it took like four years of learning and encouragement. We love her and know we'll have to care for her. \n\nE loves toys. She especially likes dolls and little interactive animal toys. For Christmas, we had my parents, my two sisters and their husbands, my one sister's 15 year old daughter, and my mom's sister and her husband. \n\nR got a few games he wanted, plus a new laptop he needs for his classes next semester. E got dolls, a small dollhouse, some pajamas, some stuffed animals, and the big gift was a interactive horse toy that you can braid the hair of and things. E was overjoyed, and played with it up until it was time for lunch. \n\nI didn't notice anything before, but at lunch, my mom was looking over at my sister, B, and her daughter, M, like they had done something wrong. I helped my daughter get a plate of food, got her a juice box, and went to get my own food. I then heard yelling and my daughter crying and went back to the table. Turns out M had told E she's childish and shouldn't want toys anymore, and needs to grow up, and my sisters both agreed! M told her that she should be braiding her own hair instead of a toy's fake hair, and make herself pretty instead of making a toy pretty. My mom and my father were horrified, and they had apparently heard M and B express this earlier and told them they were being insensitive and will be in trouble if they tell me, my husband, or E that. R, the great brother he is, took E away from the situation and up to her room to calm down. \n\nI, as calmly as possible, explained for the millionth time that E is autistic, her brain works differently, and if you were with her daily, you would see that her toys actually help her learn social skills, regulate her emotions, and calm her down. B then said that I \"baby\" her too much. We make meals for her, get her food, buy her toys, and drive her everywhere, when we should just \"force\" her to learn on her own. B said that because she does school, she's \"normal enough to live on her own\" (the exact words). I told B, M, and B's husband to leave. My other sister and her husband tried to defend them, saying that if I just \"cut the cord\" E would learn how to survive. I told them to leave too. \n\nMy husband is with me, as is my father, but my mother said I took it too far by kicking them out and saying I'm never letting them around E again. They really hurt E. Luckily she's still playing with her toys, so they didn't seem to ruin her love of them, but she's been sad and crying all day. I just put her to bed and started crying myself once she wasn't able to see me do it. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672024497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvdq9f/aita_for_kicking_family_out_on_christmas_over/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And they're mean, so they don't deserve ponies anyway).", "NTA, but Oh my god(s), have you seen Rapunzel? When Mother Gothel says \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cThe world is dark, and selfish, and cruel. If it finds even the slightest ray of sunshine, it destroys it!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's talking about people like your sister and her horrible joy-sucking family. There's absolutely nothing wrong with liking \"childish\" things at any age, and, well, they're not only ableist, but the way they talk, it seems they're also hella sexist too... if your son got games it kind of surprises me they see dolls as childish but not video games, and the fact their argument is that she should be able to do chores and make herself pretty... They're probably jealous that you're allowing your daughter to just be herself.\n\n Yeah, I wouldn't let her near my children either.", "NTA. M was being cruel. And your sisters should understand your daughter better by now.", "Don't mind me, I'm just screaming NTA at the top of my lungs.", "They saw you cutting the cord. That's why they were yeeted the fuck out.\n\nDon't accept anything from them but a sincere apology. Any of them. No contact until then. They clearly need to be babied so they can tame their undeveloped emotions, so it's probably worth giving them the parent treatment of \"Don't come back until you know why what you did was wrong\"", "That is horrible what they did to E. Your daughter sounds bright and amazing. She is learning. I don\u2019t understand how ignorant you sisters and niece are. They don\u2019t want to understand. You have nothing to apologize for. Maybe getting kicked out will teach them compassion or the very least E can have some peace.", "Absolutely NTA and thank you for being an amazing parent to your kids. I have autism and know I'm \"high functioning\" which I hate that term but it's easier to explain in short words to others to say essentially, I get it. But just because I appear to function well (I'm actually not, I'm suffering the whole time it's just an invisible struggle) doesn't mean I don't actually need constant support. They clearly don't understand autism and are ableist AF. You seem to know what you're doing and how autism actually works so please continue to work with her as you have been. Your sister and her daughter have no idea how messed up their version of treating her will be. Newsflash, you can't just be \"forced\" out of autistic behavior.", "NTA! You know your daughter and what she needs. They just have their own frivolous opinions. Not your problem. Good parent to this kid and NTAl", "I FEEL this so hard. My daughter is intellectually disabled/autistic and 22 yo.  She's on par with a 6 yo. \n Today my mom gave my wife and older daughter both handmade quilts and handed her an envelope with $50 in it. Money means nothing to her.  She immediately asks \"where's my quilt?\"  She didn't bring her one because she didn't think she would want one.  WTF?  It broke her heart to be excluded.  She had mini meltdown.  My parents blazed home.  Mom has been apologizing over text.  I was so livid I didn't speak to anyone for a half hour trying to calm down.  They just have no fucking idea what our life is like.\n\nEdit: sorry, NTA.", "NTA you did a good job as a parent and the brother too I applaud you both", "NTA - they were needlessly cruel to your daughter.  They\u2019re lucky all you did was kick them out.", "NTA fk them, all of them. They are awful and without the attempt at proper education and a very very thoughtful apology, I\u2019d be letting them know that you\u2019ve outgrown your relationship with them and you\u2019ll see them at mutual events for your parents and nothing more. To put it in a rude way to match their attitude, they mocked and bullied your DISABLED CHILD!", "NTA, quite frankly they\u2019re being ableist. You seem to be a great Mumma though, keep up the good work.", "YES.", "> relevant xkcd comics\n\nExcellent choices there."]}
