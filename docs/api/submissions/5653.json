E was diagnosed with autism when she was in elementary school. She does school online currently, and can do some basic tasks by herself, but me and my husband have to do a lot for her (cook for her, drive her places, etc.) She recently started doing her own laundry, which we're very proud of her for, but it took like four years of learning and encouragement. We love her and know we'll have to care for her. \n\nE loves toys. She especially likes dolls and little interactive animal toys. For Christmas, we had my parents, my two sisters and their husbands, my one sister's 15 year old daughter, and my mom's sister and her husband. \n\nR got a few games he wanted, plus a new laptop he needs for his classes next semester. E got dolls, a small dollhouse, some pajamas, some stuffed animals, and the big gift was a interactive horse toy that you can braid the hair of and things. E was overjoyed, and played with it up until it was time for lunch. \n\nI didn't notice anything before, but at lunch, my mom was looking over at my sister, B, and her daughter, M, like they had done something wrong. I helped my daughter get a plate of food, got her a juice box, and went to get my own food. I then heard yelling and my daughter crying and went back to the table. Turns out M had told E she's childish and shouldn't want toys anymore, and needs to grow up, and my sisters both agreed! M told her that she should be braiding her own hair instead of a toy's fake hair, and make herself pretty instead of making a toy pretty. My mom and my father were horrified, and they had apparently heard M and B express this earlier and told them they were being insensitive and will be in trouble if they tell me, my husband, or E that. R, the great brother he is, took E away from the situation and up to her room to calm down. \n\nI, as calmly as possible, explained for the millionth time that E is autistic, her brain works differently, and if you were with her daily, you would see that her toys actually help her learn social skills, regulate her emotions, and calm her down. B then said that I \"baby\" her too much. We make meals for her, get her food, buy her toys, and drive her everywhere, when we should just \"force\" her to learn on her own. B said that because she does school, she's \"normal enough to live on her own\" (the exact words). I told B, M, and B's husband to leave. My other sister and her husband tried to defend them, saying that if I just \"cut the cord\" E would learn how to survive. I told them to leave too. \n\nMy husband is with me, as is my father, but my mother said I took it too far by kicking them out and saying I'm never letting them around E again. They really hurt E. Luckily she's still playing with her toys, so they didn't seem to ruin her love of them, but she's been sad and crying all day. I just put her to bed and started crying myself once she wasn't able to see me do it. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672024497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvdq9f/aita_for_kicking_family_out_on_christmas_over/", "score": 625, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with liking \"childish\" things at any age, and, well, they're not only ableist, but the way they talk, it seems they're also hella sexist too... if your son got games it kind of surprises me they see dolls as childish but not video games, and the fact their argument is that she should be able to do chores and make herself pretty... They're probably jealous that you're allowing your daughter to just be herself.\n\n Yeah, I wouldn't let her near my children either.", "NTA. M was being cruel.

But just because I appear to function well (I'm actually not, I'm suffering the whole time it's just an invisible struggle) doesn't mean I don't actually need constant support. They clearly don't understand autism and are ableist AF. You seem to know what you're doing and how autism actually works so please continue to work with her as you have been.

Count your blessings, and tell them they can stay out of your lives if they can\u2019t wrap their head around basic humane decency.

Your daughter sounds like a high support needs autistic. She may eventually be able to do a lot of chores and self care things herself, but may never be able to actually function on her own. Even as someone with lower support needs, I find it hard. I can't imagine how scary that would be for her. She needs you, and you are providing what she needs. From your post, it sounds like you are encouraging your daughter to expand what chores she can do for herself without pushing her too far.\n\nYour sisters and niece are incredibly ableist, and have not bothered to understand what autism means. If they've even bothered looking it up at all, they've certainly gotten their information from poor sources (iykyk).
