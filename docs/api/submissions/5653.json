E was diagnosed with autism when she was in elementary school. She does school online currently, and can do some basic tasks by herself, but me and my husband have to do a lot for her (cook for her, drive her places, etc.) She recently started doing her own laundry, which we're very proud of her for, but it took like four years of learning and encouragement. We love her and know we'll have to care for her. \n\nE loves toys. She especially likes dolls and little interactive animal toys. For Christmas, we had my parents, my two sisters and their husbands, my one sister's 15 year old daughter, and my mom's sister and her husband. \n\nR got a few games he wanted, plus a new laptop he needs for his classes next semester. E got dolls, a small dollhouse, some pajamas, some stuffed animals, and the big gift was a interactive horse toy that you can braid the hair of and things. E was overjoyed, and played with it up until it was time for lunch. \n\nI didn't notice anything before, but at lunch, my mom was looking over at my sister, B, and her daughter, M, like they had done something wrong. I helped my daughter get a plate of food, got her a juice box, and went to get my own food. I then heard yelling and my daughter crying and went back to the table. Turns out M had told E she's childish and shouldn't want toys anymore, and needs to grow up, and my sisters both agreed! M told her that she should be braiding her own hair instead of a toy's fake hair, and make herself pretty instead of making a toy pretty. My mom and my father were horrified, and they had apparently heard M and B express this earlier and told them they were being insensitive and will be in trouble if they tell me, my husband, or E that. R, the great brother he is, took E away from the situation and up to her room to calm down. \n\nI, as calmly as possible, explained for the millionth time that E is autistic, her brain works differently, and if you were with her daily, you would see that her toys actually help her learn social skills, regulate her emotions, and calm her down. B then said that I \"baby\" her too much. We make meals for her, get her food, buy her toys, and drive her everywhere, when we should just \"force\" her to learn on her own. B said that because she does school, she's \"normal enough to live on her own\" (the exact words). I told B, M, and B's husband to leave. My other sister and her husband tried to defend them, saying that if I just \"cut the cord\" E would learn how to survive. I told them to leave too. \n\nMy husband is with me, as is my father, but my mother said I took it too far by kicking them out and saying I'm never letting them around E again. They really hurt E. Luckily she's still playing with her toys, so they didn't seem to ruin her love of them, but she's been sad and crying all day. I just put her to bed and started crying myself once she wasn't able to see me do it. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672024497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvdq9f/aita_for_kicking_family_out_on_christmas_over/", "score": 1559, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is lucky to have you as her mom", "NTA My dearest friend has a son who is developed delayed her MIL believed if she sent him to a normal private school he would be normal and because he went to  a special Ed school that's why he wasn't normal you keep advocating for your daughter", "Beats me how any adult can be so dim-witted  \n\n\nI suppose your niece gets a bit of leeway; having a parent so stupid has probably held back her own mental and emotional development", "NTA dealing with people like your sisters are the reason some of us autistic folk become shut ins (shut in referring to not leaving the house)\n\nIt\u2019s rather typical for autistic people to have interests that seem immature. How does it hurt anyone? One of my interests is Disney and my daughter and I collect pop funkos together. My 11 year old son with higher support needs has an interest that is typical or pre schoolers. He is ver much his age in most respects outside of this interest. When you don\u2019t allow people to live people to live happily as themselves it\u2019s an invitation for mental health concerns.\n\nIt sounds like you are doing a great job in terms of slowly and respectfully teaching her the skills she needs in life whilst respecting who she is. She doesn\u2019t need to be independent tomorrow. 19 is still young.\n\nI and we\u2019re you over the top. Not in the slightest. Your daughter will know you have her back now", "NTA, never let them around her ever again. What they said is horrible and clearly demonstrates willful ignorance as well as a lack of empathy. If they were willing to try n bully her the moment you just left the room then imagine scenarios where you weren't there at all. They are terrible and your mom needs to realize that what you did was necessary inorder to protect your child", "NTA...you did the right thing. I have a husband who has aspergers and how you stayed so calm and didn't get into a screaming match is beyond me. What they did was very insensitive. However it does sound like you are babying her to much. If you were able to get get her to do laundry, then she should be able to get her own food and drink herself. The toys, if it helps her out, it helps her! However she is 19 not 2 I'd have her get her own food from now on. Same with putting your daughter to bed. She should be able to do that now herself.", "NTA, you were protecting your child from a bunch of insensitive twats", "NTA, The ignorant part of your family seems really stubborn if they don't have the capacity to understand that your daughter has different needs than other people and I am sad to hear that they can't see the love and care there that seems in the right place. However your Husband and son acted admirably  with their actions along with you (the dad also seems to have the heart in the right place). Hope your daughter enjoys her presents and doesn't lose the passion for that what makes her happy because of ignorant words from seemingly ignorant people. I wish you happy holidays and hope you enjoy the them with those closest to you.", "NTA. Also a lot of places have modified curriculum for kids too. Being asses on Christmas", "NTA but jeez do your sisters suck. It's almost 2023, how do they not understand what autism is?", "NTA only people who can be kind and respectful are allowed in my house which means my in-laws aren\u2019t allowed for this kind of ableist BS", "nta. you know what your daughter needs better than any of them do, and i'm glad you stood up for her instead of letting them make her feel bad for being who she is.   \nyou're never \"too old\" for toys as long as you continue to get joy out of having them around. i'm in my early thirties and i have more stuffed animals than i can count because they are soft, cute and bring me comfort.", "NTA\n\nBtw I'm almost 30, on the spectrum and have CPTSD. I lived alone since I was 18, put myself trough school and worked until physical disability and CPTSD made it impossible. I had a nice big plushie that I had since I was four. I don't have it anymore because it makes the rounds of the people I love that need him. Currently with me in my bed are a plushie I got from a friend when I was 17 because she saw me admiring it, my dog and two squishmallows I acquired this year because hugging them helps me trough panic attacks. There's nothing wrong with adults doing whatever makes them happy as long as it doesn't harm others (i.e. behave like your sisters)", "NTA and may I say you\u2019re a wonderful mother! I\u2019m 39 years old and that horse toy sounds awesome!", "NTA and even if you were, who cares?", "Hard NTA, take it from someone with Autism, you are doing great Mama bear. It isn't easy learning how to socialize. Being able to grow at our own pace with people who support us is actually a big deal to someone with Autism. Please tell your daughter that I think she's doing great and not to listen to the meanies. Keep being you. If they don't like it, that's their problem", "NTA\u2026screw them\u2026judging by your post and the reaction of your son you seem to be doing an amazing job as a mom", "NTA you're a better person. If snot nosed brat started telling me how to do something they would be in a world of pain", "NTA.\n\nI have acquired neurodivergence and have learnt now, that **the most** important thing for my wellbeing is to be around people who not only accept me as I am, but who also actively support me to be able to participate in a world that isn't built for disabled people. You 100% have done the right thing by your daughter. To expose her to any more of that horrific behaviour would not be having her wellbeing as a priority, which it absolutely must be, especially because of who she is and how she experiences the world. \n\nI hope that you can see how many internet strangers are proud of you, your son, and your husband. I know it's really nothing to mitigate the pain you must feel of knowing your family have behaved so hurtfully, but you parented exactly how your daughter needed you to parent that day, which is more than can be said for many, many others.", "NTA - Im autistic too, thanks for standing up for your daughter. You seem like a parent that respects her limits but are helping and encouraging her to further develop on her own terms. I know a lot of people in our community would have needed parents like you are to your kids. Your relatives seem to not understand what a disabilty is or what this specific one really entails.. there is only so much explanation one can do. At this point it seems they just dont want to understand. Maybe you can reduce the contact or at least dont let them near your daughter for the time being.", "NTA. I'd never let those people anywhere near me again if I knew them and I don't have an autistic child.", "Hey mama OP you did nothing wrong and you did a great job protecting your child. Nice to know that your son did a great job protecting her so you both are NTA. You both saved her Christmas too\n\nYou guys deserve better. Time for you to stop the invites and cut the cord off until B and M learn how to be kind and respectful. It won't surprise me if they have done the same to other people like E which is not okay", "NTA-my 22 year old son is autistic. You are doing everything right to help your daughter grow. I would have done the same thing. I always love it when people who are ignorant try to tell me how to rear my child, like they are some kind of expert. Have they told you that if you had spanked her, she would be better?  I get that occasionally.", "NTA your house, your rules. Maybe they will learn to respect people especially when they\u2019re under that persons roof.", "NTA big time. But your sisters and niece are. \n\nIf they don\u2019t understand or have enough knowledge about something to form an informed opinion, they need to listen to others (you & your family) who have way more knowledge and experience. It\u2019s embarrassing on their part and they should be ashamed of themselves. \n\nYour daughter is so lucky to have such amazing parents and brother that protect her and take appropriate care of her. As someone with a non-verbal autistic sibling, I know how hard and frustrating it is to try to explain to people the situation without them even making an effort to do a basic Google search. Go you guys! And sending you lots of love", "NTA. Your daughter is incapable of doing all these things by herself and it's time your other family members realise that or fuck off.", "If your family doesn't understand your parenting, they need look no further than R, who immediately acted with empathy and helped E avoid those hurting her and helped calm her down. \n\nIf anyone has any reason to feel frustrated about a child being given different attention or \"babying\" it would be the neurotypical sibling who might feel envy, missing some of that attention. R's response was not agreeing and saying yeah its tough that E gets extra help and attention. He heard their criticism and gave E more because she was hurting. What a guy. \n\nNTA. Your kids are great people. Those who refuse to understand that don't need a seat at their table.", "NTA.\nYou are nicer than me. If they reiterated the statement that I needed to force my daughter to learn to survive, I would tell them they need to force theirs to learn some manners.", "NTA. Most of your family, including your mother, are just major dicks. Good job telling them to leave. Who do they think they are to tell you how to deal with your own child. The level of ignorance is astounding.", "NTA.  You're never the asshole for protecting your daughter.  Stick to your guns, and don't them back in your life until they pull their heads out of their asses.", "I\u2019m an adult autistic woman, I do a lot of \u201cgrownup\u201d things - grocery shopping, cooking, holding down a full time job - and then spend most of my evenings chilling in a pile of plushes. I love them, I love the feeling of their fabrics, I love how squishy they are. I can\u2019t describe the comfort they bring me. Everyone needs and deserves an outlet, even neurotypicals benefit from a break in being Super Serious Adults all the time. \n\nIf your daughter finds happiness and comfort from tending to her dolls that\u2019s wonderful. Being autistic often feels like needing to find a balance between being traditionally functional and accommodating autistic soothing/comfort (which often gives you the rest/peace you need to be able to function). Taking that away from her would likely only decrease the rest of her functioning, and cause her distress. It hurts nobody just to let her enjoy what she enjoys, and I\u2019m so glad for her that she has parents (and a sibling) who know and respect that. I\u2019m sorry but your other family members are either stupid or wilfully ignorant, you can\u2019t tough love autistic traits away, it\u2019s baked into our genetics and the ways our brains work. Being able to feel safe and secure in her own home is more important than sparing idiot\u2019s feelings, NTA.", "NTA I know a 50 yo lawyer at the top of his professional game\u2026 who uses toys for his bipolar. They are on his desk and throughout his home. He collects them packaged too.", "Absolutely nta!! You are a wonderful mother and I applaud you for protecting your daughter", "NTA. Your sister is a major AH. As someone who's autistic, \"cutting the cord\" only works to lose even more executive functionality.\nI'm an adult and I live alone, and I still need help on a regular basis. So much so that I'm going to have help the municipality when it comes to cooking, cleaning, and hopefully budgeting. At 19, I also couldn't do my own laundry and I had a lot of problems fixing myself food, among other things. I also like typically toys (soft toys for me), and video games that target a younger demographic (for example I just discussed a game with my 9 year old nephew. We play a lot of the same games).\n\nKeep doing what you're doing for E, and thank you for protecting her from your sister and niece!", "NTA\n\nYeah, cutting the cord with this part of the family would be a good idea.", "NTA. Don\u2019t change mama bear!", "Oh Jesus, NTA. But your naming scheme is awful. I had to read this thrice just understand what was going on", "Being the parent of a child on the spectrum is a balance. No two are exactly the same, so they do need to learn balance and independence; it\u2019s true. The kids also need a break and allowed to be themselves and whatever quirk they have; allow them to indulge. People without kids with Autism only know what they read or see on television, it\u2019s not that easy. \n\nWe have a son (19) with DS and our Autistic (17) and  they both are successful (IMO) I\u2019m education. We have always treated both as \u201ctypical\u201d kids but\u2026 we know neither will be 100% but they don\u2019t know. Our families support our parenting and they give in to them more than we do. Lol. OP\u2019s family just seem clueless and don\u2019t care to learn. If they tried to understand they could help more than hinder.", "NTA.  Your sibs are toxic and your parents need to understand as PARENTS that you are protecting your child.  They had a heck of a lot of nerve doing that to her.  I would not let them around her anymore.", "NTA. They have zero insight but feel entitled enough to lecture you on how to raise a daughter with a condition they know nothing about and upset her at Christmas, too. What horrible people.", "I don't think they understand autism. They need to be educated about this.", "NTA - Do you baby your daughter? From what you say, yes you do. Do your sisters or I have to live with your daughter and manage her special needs? No.", "Agree NTA. OPs her mother and knows her child - when she's ready to move to other things, same as the laundry - they will know. \n\nThough mods - perhaps including in the rules to use fake names rather than initials would be a good idea. It's super hard to read and comprehend when you need to recall initials of multiple peeps. I know people do it for privacy but it gets a bit confusing", "I agree with this, someone would of left with a bruised head if that was me though because they're disgusting and disrespectful.", "OP your mother should agree with those ableists AH of she's defending them instead of realizing how horrible and damaging were their actions and words. Go LC with your mother, if she doesn't get why it was so wrong she shouldn't be close to your child. \nYour sister should try to educate herself before attack someone (shouldn't have attacked your child, that's so fck up).\nNTA.", "I'm not sure you do, but please don't associate being autistic with being mentally disabled. You can be autistic, lack in executive function and have a high IQ. E seems to have a special interest around toys (not uncommon) and to suffer from executive function in certain aspects of life, but that doesn't make her mentally disabled.", "Oops. Should say \u201cIn education\u201d.", "Just like with cancer or a broken leg! If you\u2019d just stop babying them/yourself you be up and about. \nStop being such a whiner! <s>", "So this is what I\u2019ve been doing wrong with my autistic son all these years! When I think of all the time I\u2019ve wasted teaching him to speak and all the money on specialists\u2026 I\u2019m so angry I could spit! NTA and I\u2019m in awe of your self control and horrified at their ignorance and lack of compassion and the fact that they obviously haven\u2019t even googled the basics of autism to try to understand."]}
