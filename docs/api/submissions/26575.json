Even if your teacher leaving for a rehearsal was professional behaviour the school knew about (I very much doubt it) you should not have been expected to pay for lessons you didn't receive. Adults complaining behind your back about work-related stuff is totally TA bejaviour.\n\nIf your friends say anything just tell them that she's complaining about doing the work she was paid to do.", "NTA.  You paid for lessons that your teacher never showed up for - totally unprofessional on her part.  At a bare minimum, your teacher should have not taken your money.  You were right to tell your mom.", "NTA. Mom is paying for this, you\u2019re entitled to those lessons.\n\nAlso\u2026.she\u2019s shit talking you behind your back?  Tell Mom about this too so this unprofessional nitwit gets the riot act read to her (you\u2019re 17, you should actually be the one telling her to keep her mouth shut though. You put up with that horseshit?)", "(English is my third language, I apologize for any mistakes) \nNTA. You're paying for a service they fail to provide in compensation. If I'd been in your shoes, I'd make an attempt to regain that money back, as they were at fault for failing to provide the lessons. Honestly, I wish you'd told your mother even that first time.. If they truly didn't have time for your lesson, they should have declined / recompensatied your money  for those times.. Or found a substitute. Your teacher saw a free money-grab, and took it. They got petty and bitter once the consequences of them taking advantage of you caught up to them. \n\nAlso, your teacher shouldn't be telling you that it 'sounds terrible'. They should be working towards helping you and giving advice on how to improve something you could've done better. The entire point of you being there is to better your skill, not that you started out as a natural-super gifted talent at creating the most amazing piece seen by mankind. It's completely unprofessional of her, and while I'd like to think the best of people and that this was just worded poorly.. This is backed up by the fact she went to 'backtalk' you to other students and people, who have no business being even aware of your situation.. (even ignoring the fact she was the cause of the issues). She is acting like an actual petty, angry child who didn't get her favorite toy; when she is supposed to be your teacher.. She isn't suppoded to judge you, she is supposed to help you learn and improve. You're not paying for a judge. Your paying for a teacher. And you're certainly not paying for this toxic entitled behaviour. You couldn't have been less of an AH in this situation if you tried.  \n\nTLDR; Strong NTA for OP. Teacher is petty, and acting more like a judgemental child than a teacher. Clear signs of toxic behaviour.. Teacher is TA here.", "NTA. Her behaviour is in appropriate and charging you lessons when she did not appear is not ok.", "NTA\n\nYou need a new singing teacher.

If she had rehearsal that conflicted with your lesson (which definitely does happen with professionals) then she should have come up with a new time with you, not just told you too bad so sad. And the badmouthing is just unacceptable. She\u2019s being so unprofessional and I think your mom needs to be told again so that the higher ups in the school know how she\u2019s acting.", "NTA and have the teacher reported for gossiping to students", "NTA and you should complain again that she is now complaining because this is totally unprofessional, she was not doing her job and has the audacity to complain about being called out?", "Nta Your mom paid for the lesson. You are entitled to receive it.", "NTA at all and the school needs to know that the teacher is continuing to retaliate against you. They are very unprofessional and should have arranged for someone else to cover your class.", "nta. and you should tell your mom that you are now hearing that your teacher is complaining about you. your teacher is being paid and skipping her job. now the complaining. it\u2019s highly unprofessional.", "Nta. She should not be collecting payments for lessons you aren\u2019t receiving!", "NTA, your singing teacher is grossly unprofessional.  If she wasn't coming to your lessons, she should have been charging you for lessons, as she literally did nothing to earn the money.  If she was in a production that took up your regular singing time, then she should have arranged a different time, since obviously she could as she did after getting called out on it.  On top of that, she absolutely should not be complaining about you to other students because the school found out she wasn't actually doing her job that she was charging people for.  \n\n\nHow old is this woman?  Because she acts like a bratty teenager.  Honestly, I would suggest going back to the school *again* regarding her continued, unprofessional behavior of bad-mouthing you to the other students because she was expected to do her job.", "NTA. You were paying for a service you didn't receive. She clearly didn't communicate with the school about her absences or you would have had a sub/been given a refund. That's on her, the same way it's on me if I decide to blow off my job to go be in a play. Let your mom know she's badmouthing you. She is the one that messed up; if she can't accept that and be professional then she doesn't need to be working there. Please don't feel bad- all of this is her making choices. You aren't responsible for the consequences of those choices.", "NTA, and this warrants another call to the school. Teachers do NOT complain about one student to their other students, ever. That's unprofessional as all get-out and an ethical violation. Talk to your parents again. The school needs to put a stop to this ASAP.", "NTA\n\nThe teacher is the one being the unprofessional AH here.", "Tell your mother immediately. The voice coach was stealing from you/your mom and is unprofessional. NTA.", "NTA. You did the right thing and you're singing teacher sucks. she wasn't even going to make up the missed classes. she's only made up one so far. She still has another one to make up and now she's mad because she probably got reprimanded at the school.", "Teacher here! That's not professional and if this was through the school I'd be contacting the principal!!!\nNTA", "NTA and what an unprofessional teacher talking behind her pupils back to others\u2026 disgusting attitude. \n\nShe should make sure she is doing her duty and what\u2019s she\u2019s paid to do.", "NTA, the teacher was paid for a service that was not delivered. That's theft.", "NTA Complain to the school behind her back. Bet that gets around to her like her gossiping to kids (how professional!) did to you. Call her a thief to the school, too, because that is what she is. Taking money for services not rendered... from a kid. Make sure if she has input into your grade that you don't let her tank you.", "This reminds me that when i was a kid and had swimming lessons and the teacher every lesson left me alone to go dating some student that was been taking lessons too... \n\nWell, lets say that he didn't stay in that school for long haha", "Hell no. NTA.", "NTA. Your teacher should have rescheduled all of the lessons IMMEDIATELY when she realized that she would miss them, even if you weren\u2019t paying extra for them. The fact that you were paying extra makes it worse.", "NTA. Taking money for lessons that are canceled is stealing at the very least. Your teacher is exceptionally unprofessional talking about you. I hope your mother follows up on this latest example of her lack of professionalism.", "NTA. I booked a series of lessons last fall (voice and trumpet combo) and prepaid because that\u2019s how the school had it set up. And my teacher always made sure we had make up lessons when one of us had to miss a lesson. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done professionally. Had I been paying lesson by lesson, I would not have had to pay for a lesson unless a make up lesson was provided. She also didn\u2019t communicate about missing the second lesson, another thing that\u2019s not professional. Finally, talking about you to other students? That\u2019s out of line as well. Please ask your mother to report this if you don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it yourself.", "NTA.  A teacher should never try to get a kid to keep a secret from their parents, and talking about a student behind their back - especially to other students?? Hell no.", "Exactly. And the moment when she started backstabbing you was the moment you needed to escalate this to your principal.\nTeacher needs to be put in her place, that's the principals job.\nNTA, obviously.", "I just want to say that for English being your third language, this was written extremely well! Also, you are AMAZING to be able to know three languages!!", "I\u2019m concerned that this teacher is the one who\u2019s going to grade her performance - op needs to tell mom EVERYTHING that is going on and get the principal to sit on the performance.", "NTA, and she is acting extremely unprofessional. I'd go back to your mother and ask for her help escalating this to the administration. Your teacher should not be badmouthing you to the other students.", "NTA tell your mom that she's retaliating against you. Use that word, it's a big legal no-no.", "NTA. Your teacher is both an adult and a professional. She should have called your mother first and let her know she wouldn't be able to attend those lessons, not gone through you. The fact that she continued to accept payment for those lessons is also ridiculous. Tell your mom about the bad mouthing and see about making an appointment with the principal together. Make sure the school is aware of her behavior and attitude.", "NTA. You were paying for the lessons, and she had an obligation to appear. That she further began to talk shit about you to other students just proves she's an unprofessional hack, and you should absolutely escalate this to your principle. She's behaving abominably, and shouldn't be allowed to teach if this is how she's going to act. Plus, her behaviour is having a direct impact on your grade! Don't let her take advantage of you.", "NTA she\u2019s unprofessional as hell, report her once more.", "obviously you\u2019re NTA, wtf.", "NTA. Make sure your mother is aware of EVERYTHING. The teacher should have rescheduled your lesson (ie the catch up lesson), not just missed it altogether.  That's just odd on her behalf.  Your mother needs to know everything and so does the school because the teacher might downgrade you out of spite. It's so weird that a TEACHER is complaining about you to other STUDENTS. It's a weird situation. You're absolutely right to tell your mother. A grown adult is trying to manipulate and character assassinate a child. (I know at 17 you're practically an adult and frankly sound more mature than the actual adult teacher, but for the purposes of your education and the relationship with the teacher, she is the adult and you are the child.)", "so your teacher is taking money for services not performed\n\nso your teacher was not providing lessons which she knows the lack will affect your grade/future\n\nso your teacher is blaming you and slandering you behind your back.\n\nNO you are NTA and this needs to be told to your mum/school.  She is behaving in a unprofessional manner(and technically she's stealing/fraud/contract breach--one of them).", "Absolutely NTA. You are paying for a service, if your teacher isn\u2019t performing the service she shouldn\u2019t get paid. My kids take violin/viola lessons for the same teacher. She occasionally has to cancel lessons for her own music performances. She doesn\u2019t expect to get paid for canceled lessons.", "NTA.  And tell your mom.  About the gossip.  The school needs to act.  And reign in this teacher.  And quickly.", "NTA but tell your mom she's badmouthing you; she owed you 2 lessons and it sounds like she expected to be paid for missing them.\n\nShe absolutely shouldn't badmouth you.\n\nIt isn't clear to me whether these are private lessons through a teacher at your school or a private music teacher; if your teacher is employed by your school or a private music school, her employer needs to know that she skipped out on lessons, expecting to be paid for them and is bad-mouthing you to your peers.\n\nIf she's self-employed, your mom needs to find you another singing teacher if the class continues, get a refund for the class that wasn't made up, tell her it's simply inappropriate to a) miss lessons and expect to be paid; b) miss lessons so close to a performance; c) badmouth students and d) leave a bad review and tell your friends parents she skipped lessons just before your competition and badmouthed you for expecting make-up lessons and only giving you one of 2 missed.", "Why is the teacher even allowed to accept money for tutoring her own student? This situation should never have been allowed to occur. In our school district, teachers cannot tutor-for-pay any student who is in their class, pod, or team.", "also OP/OP's mom needs to find her a new teacher and get a return of all money where services were not rendered.", "Different teachers. The school music teacher is the one that told her that her pieces weren't good . Mainly because she hasn't been getting the tutoring she needs!", "Because it's not the teacher? Sounds like it's someone who contracts throught the school", "No, this is a singing teacher. Like private lessons. NIT the music teacher who is grading her", "It doesn't sound like they are the same teacher. She takes lessons and the teacher of those lessons was dipping out and now talking about her to her other students, not her music theory instructor at the school she attends", "That wasn't clear to me; I couldn't tell if this was a teacher at the school, a teacher at a music school or a self-employed music teacher."]}
