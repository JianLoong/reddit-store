Even if your teacher leaving for a rehearsal was professional behaviour the school knew about (I very much doubt it) you should not have been expected to pay for lessons you didn't receive. Adults complaining behind your back about work-related stuff is totally TA bejaviour.\n\nIf your friends say anything just tell them that she's complaining about doing the work she was paid to do.", "NTA.  You paid for lessons that your teacher never showed up for - totally unprofessional on her part.  At a bare minimum, your teacher should have not taken your money.  You were right to tell your mom.", "NTA. Mom is paying for this, you\u2019re entitled to those lessons.\n\nAlso\u2026.she\u2019s shit talking you behind your back?  Tell Mom about this too so this unprofessional nitwit gets the riot act read to her (you\u2019re 17, you should actually be the one telling her to keep her mouth shut though. You put up with that horseshit?)", "(English is my third language, I apologize for any mistakes) \nNTA. You're paying for a service they fail to provide in compensation. If I'd been in your shoes, I'd make an attempt to regain that money back, as they were at fault for failing to provide the lessons. Honestly, I wish you'd told your mother even that first time.. If they truly didn't have time for your lesson, they should have declined / recompensatied your money  for those times.. Or found a substitute. Your teacher saw a free money-grab, and took it. They got petty and bitter once the consequences of them taking advantage of you caught up to them. \n\nAlso, your teacher shouldn't be telling you that it 'sounds terrible'. They should be working towards helping you and giving advice on how to improve something you could've done better. The entire point of you being there is to better your skill, not that you started out as a natural-super gifted talent at creating the most amazing piece seen by mankind. It's completely unprofessional of her, and while I'd like to think the best of people and that this was just worded poorly.. This is backed up by the fact she went to 'backtalk' you to other students and people, who have no business being even aware of your situation.. (even ignoring the fact she was the cause of the issues). She is acting like an actual petty, angry child who didn't get her favorite toy; when she is supposed to be your teacher.. She isn't suppoded to judge you, she is supposed to help you learn and improve. You're not paying for a judge. Your paying for a teacher. And you're certainly not paying for this toxic entitled behaviour. You couldn't have been less of an AH in this situation if you tried.  \n\nTLDR; Strong NTA for OP. Teacher is petty, and acting more like a judgemental child than a teacher. Clear signs of toxic behaviour.. Teacher is TA here.", "NTA. Her behaviour is in appropriate and charging you lessons when she did not appear is not ok.", "NTA\n\nYou need a new singing teacher. One who acts professionally and reasonably.\n\nGood luck with your performance!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
