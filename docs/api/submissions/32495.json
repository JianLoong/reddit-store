Wow, he looked at the stereotype of the lazy asshole husband who makes the wife get his family presents, went \"oh challenge accepted,\" and decided to top it by adding \"reject the gifts my wife picks,\" and then add \"just take shit from my wife and regift it to them?\"  Well isn't that just the perfect shit cherry on the crap sundae.\n\nNTA and tell him to go pick his own present for his mom - from the store, not your closet.", "NTA\n\nWhy would he want to give mom a second-hand watch that wasn't even his to offer?

No one should ever attempt to give away your things. He can buy her a brand-new watch if he's so concerned that she should get one for Christmas.", "NTA  Sorry, deciding to \"gift\" his mother a possession of yours just screams cheap.", "You're NTA, and your husband definitely is.  I would recommend that you bow out of any holiday shopping for his family, nephews and nieces on his side - you shop for your side, let him shop for his.  Let him know that starting this year, this is no longer a chore you're able to accommodate.  And lock up your valuables ;)", "nta\n\nAre you sure that your house was burgled?(reddit conspiracy mode).\n\nYour husband seems to think that your belongings are his and that you don't deserve to have them.

Oh, there's one you don't use. - Not thinking about the emotional attachment you may have.\n\nLet it go.", "YTA, just for keeping going. Neither position is wrong, and it shouldn't have been such a big issue to suggest it, given that he accepted your 'no' immediately. It seems to me that you are attached to these watches because you lost do many other family gifts with the burglary, and so you are hyper protective of them. That's fine. But he accepted your answer.", "ESH.\n\nYou for not letting his (admittedly stupid) suggestion go; and him for letting you do the shopping for his mother but rejecting gift after gift.\n\nI'd say you were also a bit of an asshole for continuing to shop for his mother under those circumstances, but it sounds like you like your MIL and you know he'd fuck it up. lol", "YTA.  You told him no and he was okay with it and left it at that?  What\u2019s your problem?  His relationship with his mom in this matter doesn\u2019t effect you.  I can imagine a lot of scenarios that I\u2019d be happy to get a used watch, an old Breitling watch would be the best gift I\u2019ve ever received, if anyone was that thoughtful, for example.  Clearly you wouldn\u2019t appreciate a gift like that, but a lot of people would.", "YTA:  You said no and he said ok and then you decided to argue on behalf of his mother.  Do you know if she would be offended or you simply think she would since you would be offended.  \n\nBecause I'm thinking in my life and if i gave my dad a barely used very nice watch he would be happy with it.  Even if he finds out it used to belong to me.  Maybe his mom is the same way", "YTA. He asked, and you said no, and he said fine, and you wouldn't let it go, and he apologized, and you're still bent for some reason. What are you looking for exactly?", "ESH. He returned 3 items you picked without just going out and buying the gift himself? Rude. But you already won this battle and carried on complaining. Also rude.\n\nAs an aside you and he have crappy communication if he doesn\u2019t already know the sentimental value of those watches to you, you can\u2019t figure out after the first couple of goes what the problem is with the gifts you chose, and you can\u2019t express your feelings in a way that lets him know that you\u2019re upset without feeling the need to harp on about it for hours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t understand these A.H verdicts- this is a weird request and absolutely bares questioning.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about why specifically _this_ time? Sounds like OP buying gift options is one of the norm (whole other issue) so what prompted this \u2018off-hand\u2019 suggestion?", "NTA his family isn't superficial but he made you return the first three options? So just he is the superficial one? Why are you shopping for his mother just for him to reject what you've chosen? Definitely don't give her one of your watches and make him do his own shopping from now on.", "That's what I was thinking too.  It reminds me of the division of holiday preparation in my house growing up.  My father complained about the Christmas gifts my mother bought for his family, he bitched about the Christmas tree every year.  He did absolutely none of the planning, the shopping, the writing of Christmas cards, the wrapping of gifts, the mailing or delivering, the cooking or cleaning or decorating (except for putting the tree in the trees and and complaining).  My mother did everything, including all the normal household chores and childcare, on top of her full time job as a teacher.  So my head went immediately to what an absolute lazy bastard.  I know I have my own issues ;)", "I\u2019d go get a bunch of his stuff and start wrapping it up as gifts for my family.

Especially when one was a gift to you. Wtf. You're NTA, if he really wants to give his mother a watch he can go buy one to give her.", "You're not crazy. Those are your watches and have sentimental value. If he wants to regift something he can give his Mom something of his. Criminey! NTA by the way.", "And that would be on him. There is no point in you doing extra work. It is not your job it is his job. Make him learn from his incompetence", "That's on him. You're busy with other things it's the least he can do.  My siblings got nothing  while my husband gotten gift cards for years. It's  kinda disappointing  how we (I am) less then him .", "And yet he still apologized. Agree to disagree, accept the apology for the misstep, and let it go is a great option! He was unintentionally insensitive, not guilty of committing some kind of a crime.", "Does an insincere apology still qualify as such?", "For this type of petty misunderstanding, a thousand times yes! More people should try it, instead of dying on every hill trying to prove who was \"right\" in what is essentially a difference of opinion. They're both right. They're both wrong. I can definitely see apologizing for upsetting her, but not necessarily thinking the reaction was proportionate to the offense or that I had to agree that I was in any way insulting my mother (?). I see where she's coming from, but why she's deliberately escalating it is unexplained.", "Anybody willing to regift from their partner\u2019s stuff should absolutely be getting the side-eye.

Don't show hubby or tell him about it. \n\nAlso, I really hope Santa brings you a nice stocking full of stuff you actually want this year. My guess is you'll have to buy it and stuff it yourself.  But I hope it's filled with fun stuff.", "Wow! \n\nOk, first of all, NTA bc your husband was just being lazy about it. And hella weird. \n\nBut just so you know- I would be THRILLED if I was gifted a vintage LV or Burberry watch! Absolutely beside myself!! \n\nI spend all my money on my kids. It\u2019s what I want to do and what they deserve. But that means that I, having been a mom for 20 years already with 13 more years to go before my youngest is 18, don\u2019t have anything. I missed the chance to buy myself that stuff. I\u2019ll still die happy never owning a single piece of LV or Burberry but I\u2019m still a person. I love and appreciate beautiful things- even if they are used. ;) \n\nThere are plenty of us that would appreciate the hell out of those watches for one reason or another so don\u2019t worry too much about that.", "NTA look the problem here isn\u2019t that the watch is used, the problem is it isn\u2019t your husbands to give away.  Sometimes \u201cused\u201d property can be thoughtful or meaningful. You need to have a talk about boundaries and disrespect in assuming he can take your belongings and give them away.

Nta", "NTA but if I were you I would put those watches in a safe deposit box.\n\nI personally would love a vintage watch as a gift but one that had been chosen for me or had a personal meaning, not just a random regift.", "NTA.  Personally I love finding great deals on used items and totally don't mind getting a gift that was previously owned if it's an item that can be passed well from person to person. My parents are always finding great furniture for my household, I give them ideas of things to look out for on their hunts.  But that's not the same as \"I don't use this anymore here I guess it's your present\" which is what your husband seems to want. Also it's not his to pass on.", "Even if the family is not \u201cbrand conscious\u201d or \u201cdoesn\u2019t mind\u201d it still seems not right to gift something like that under the guise of a Christmas gift.

So he returned them.. if I don\u2019t do it then she won\u2019t end up with anything and as a fellow mom I feel like that would hurt that my kid didn\u2019t get me anything but got dad and the other son something", "Yeah I will probably have to go get something on my own so she gets something. And so that I get something. I appreciate the sentiment and I think I will get a ton of fun me stuff this year", "Thank you, I thought it was really skeevy too .. not sure how he was so blas\u00e9 about it though..", "I don\u2019t even know. I don\u2019t think I can just drop it since the expectation will be there.. it would just be a bad situation for me", "I appreciate this sentiment and if the watches were not sentimental and I knew her well enough to know that she would also have this same perspective, I think it would be fine if I was giving out of my own personal belongings. I think him trying to ask about giving my belongings away was no cool.", "His perspective was that he didn\u2019t give it away, he was \u201cjust asking\u201d to see if he could. Which I think is essentially getting to the same point, that he felt like he could give away my belongings but I was the hurdle he had to get by\u2026 smh", "I think that would be different because it\u2019s your parent and it\u2019s your own belonging. \n\nI know that in my family I\u2019ve tried giving my mom lightly used item like a sun hat after I got a different type and my dad was offended on her behalf and she never used it once. With that background and knowing they are the same generation and ethnicity as my parents it\u2019s hard to assume they would act differently, especially since it\u2019s not from their son but technically would be a used item from me, the daughter in law.", "Haha you would get along with him.", "I think that would be different because it\u2019s your parent and it\u2019s your own belonging. \n\nI know that in my family I\u2019ve tried giving my mom lightly used item like a sun hat after I got a different type and my dad was offended on her behalf and she never used it once.

Bc I\u2019m over here literally cocking my head to the side trying to see what angle he was coming from- and I can\u2019t see it! \n\nI just don\u2019t get it\u2026", "The fact that he considered giving away your belongings makes him the ah\u2026.you are right it is exactly getting to the same point. He was a jerk and is trying to defend/deflect and make you feel like you\u2019re in the wrong when you are not", "Probably not, because he didn't consider your feelings in his idea. I've moved past that in relationships and *always* ask before offering advice. Sometimes the problem doesn't need to be fixed. \n\nBut whatever.", "Why is he so focused on getting rid of your stuff? He doesn\u2019t have to share your sentimentality, but this feels disrespectful if he knows you hold onto stuff that has meaning to you", "If only things worked this way..", "This was my thinking.. I don\u2019t know why purchasing a new watch wasn\u2019t the first thought to come to him", "Because if I don\u2019t no one would get anything remotely thoughtful", "You consider those watches family heirlooms, then lock them out of your husband's reach. You may find them missing someday. NTA.", "It would be on him for sure, but for the sake of kin keeping it is de facto my reluctant job .. ugh maybe I just forget it and do nothing I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just tired", "That is sad, but I am in the same boat. I hope you treat yourself this year, even if it\u2019s just a ridiculously overpriced Starbucks drink inspired from TikTok", "Let him take the flack and reputation hit for it then. Don\u2019t let it be a reflection of your own self. Don\u2019t cover for him to make him look good. \n\nI rode my husband for weeks for addresses for his side of the family and his personal friends for baby shower invitations. He didn\u2019t do it by the time they really, really needed to be mailed asap that day I asked one last time. I texted him a digital copy of the invitation and told him good luck. No longer my task to assist with and he is now enabled to handle it solo - the rest is on him. If anyone is offended by the lack of invite or the texted photo, that\u2019s his problem to deal with.", "O_O I would hope not, especially after this blowout conversation but will keep it in mind, thank u"]}
