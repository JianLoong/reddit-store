Wow, he looked at the stereotype of the lazy asshole husband who makes the wife get his family presents, went \"oh challenge accepted,\" and decided to top it by adding \"reject the gifts my wife picks,\" and then add \"just take shit from my wife and regift it to them?\"  Well isn't that just the perfect shit cherry on the crap sundae.\n\nNTA and tell him to go pick his own present for his mom - from the store, not your closet.", "NTA\n\nWhy would he want to give mom a second-hand watch that wasn't even his to offer? Is he just being cheap? Does his mom love watches? Very strange.", "NTA, just because you don't wear them often doesn't make them less sentimental or less yours. No one should ever attempt to give away your things. He can buy her a brand-new watch if he's so concerned that she should get one for Christmas.", "NTA  Sorry, deciding to \"gift\" his mother a possession of yours just screams cheap.", "You're NTA, and your husband definitely is.  I would recommend that you bow out of any holiday shopping for his family, nephews and nieces on his side - you shop for your side, let him shop for his.  Let him know that starting this year, this is no longer a chore you're able to accommodate.  And lock up your valuables ;)", "nta\n\nAre you sure that your house was burgled?(reddit conspiracy mode).\n\nYour husband seems to think that your belongings are his and that you don't deserve to have them.  Was anything of his stolen?", "Ew, suggesting you give his mom a secondhand watch. That's so unclassy. Though your watches do sound very cool. NTA.", "No AH here\n\nHe made a suggestion, you said no and he dropped it. It's over.\n\nSome people like to solve problems, and your guy may be one of those. \n\nNeed a watch? Oh, there's one you don't use. - Not thinking about the emotional attachment you may have.\n\nLet it go.", "YTA, just for keeping going. Neither position is wrong, and it shouldn't have been such a big issue to suggest it, given that he accepted your 'no' immediately. It seems to me that you are attached to these watches because you lost do many other family gifts with the burglary, and so you are hyper protective of them. That's fine. But he accepted your answer.", "ESH.\n\nYou for not letting his (admittedly stupid) suggestion go; and him for letting you do the shopping for his mother but rejecting gift after gift.\n\nI'd say you were also a bit of an asshole for continuing to shop for his mother under those circumstances, but it sounds like you like your MIL and you know he'd fuck it up. lol", "YTA.  You told him no and he was okay with it and left it at that?  What\u2019s your problem?  His relationship with his mom in this matter doesn\u2019t effect you.  I can imagine a lot of scenarios that I\u2019d be happy to get a used watch, an old Breitling watch would be the best gift I\u2019ve ever received, if anyone was that thoughtful, for example.  Clearly you wouldn\u2019t appreciate a gift like that, but a lot of people would.", "YTA:  You said no and he said ok and then you decided to argue on behalf of his mother.  Do you know if she would be offended or you simply think she would since you would be offended.  \n\nBecause I'm thinking in my life and if i gave my dad a barely used very nice watch he would be happy with it.  Even if he finds out it used to belong to me.  Maybe his mom is the same way", "YTA. He asked, and you said no, and he said fine, and you wouldn't let it go, and he apologized, and you're still bent for some reason. What are you looking for exactly?", "ESH. He returned 3 items you picked without just going out and buying the gift himself? Rude. But you already won this battle and carried on complaining. Also rude.\n\nAs an aside you and he have crappy communication if he doesn\u2019t already know the sentimental value of those watches to you, you can\u2019t figure out after the first couple of goes what the problem is with the gifts you chose, and you can\u2019t express your feelings in a way that lets him know that you\u2019re upset without feeling the need to harp on about it for hours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Give him something lying around the house for Christmas and see if he enjoys it.", "NTA. And your husband should be buying a gift for his mother, not you.  Be ready for the fall out when he forgets.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand these A.H verdicts- this is a weird request and absolutely bares questioning.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about why specifically _this_ time? Sounds like OP buying gift options is one of the norm (whole other issue) so what prompted this \u2018off-hand\u2019 suggestion?", "NTA his family isn't superficial but he made you return the first three options? So just he is the superficial one? Why are you shopping for his mother just for him to reject what you've chosen? Definitely don't give her one of your watches and make him do his own shopping from now on.", "That's what I was thinking too.  It reminds me of the division of holiday preparation in my house growing up.  My father complained about the Christmas gifts my mother bought for his family, he bitched about the Christmas tree every year.  He did absolutely none of the planning, the shopping, the writing of Christmas cards, the wrapping of gifts, the mailing or delivering, the cooking or cleaning or decorating (except for putting the tree in the trees and and complaining).  My mother did everything, including all the normal household chores and childcare, on top of her full time job as a teacher.  So my head went immediately to what an absolute lazy bastard.  I know I have my own issues ;)", "I\u2019d go get a bunch of his stuff and start wrapping it up as gifts for my family. In fact, his gifts would all be stuff from his closet. \u201cWell, you seem to like shirts like this\u201d.", "When they last came to visit he noticed her watch band was getting old. So when he saw mine that \u201cI didn\u2019t wear very much at all\u201d he got the idea", "That was what I said!!!! But he said that his family is not so superficial and uptight about things like if a gift is new or unused. And I was like\u2026 it\u2019s not uptight, it\u2019s just regular decency when you are gifting something ? He was acting like I was crazy", "lolll then no one would get anyyyythinggg everrrr", "Glad I'm not the only one that made this connection.", "She needs to lock them up", "Probably because his apology lacked sincerity? \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t think you cared about them\u201d like that\u2019s an accepted reason to attempt to go shopping jn your spouse\u2019s drawers for family gifts\u2026", "He doesn't get to regift your property. Especially when one was a gift to you. Wtf. You're NTA, if he really wants to give his mother a watch he can go buy one to give her.", "You're not crazy. Those are your watches and have sentimental value. If he wants to regift something he can give his Mom something of his. Criminey! NTA by the way.", "And that would be on him. There is no point in you doing extra work. It is not your job it is his job. Make him learn from his incompetence", "That's on him. You're busy with other things it's the least he can do.  My siblings got nothing  while my husband gotten gift cards for years. It's  kinda disappointing  how we (I am) less then him .", "And yet he still apologized. Agree to disagree, accept the apology for the misstep, and let it go is a great option! He was unintentionally insensitive, not guilty of committing some kind of a crime.", "Does an insincere apology still qualify as such?", "For this type of petty misunderstanding, a thousand times yes! More people should try it, instead of dying on every hill trying to prove who was \"right\" in what is essentially a difference of opinion. They're both right. They're both wrong. I can definitely see apologizing for upsetting her, but not necessarily thinking the reaction was proportionate to the offense or that I had to agree that I was in any way insulting my mother (?). I see where she's coming from, but why she's deliberately escalating it is unexplained.", "Anybody willing to regift from their partner\u2019s stuff should absolutely be getting the side-eye. Especially when their apology was \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care. My family isn\u2019t as uptight about stuff like this.\u201d", "Ok, my bad."]}
