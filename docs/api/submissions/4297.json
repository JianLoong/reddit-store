The only explanation we ever got was his ADHD that caused it. \n\nI was absolutely terrified of a repeat when I had my second, but knew that my husband (by then my oldest was almost 8 when I had my second) would help me when he was home (he works away often), but I had a miracle child that slept through the night at like 3 weeks old (6-8 hrs straight, we tried a few time to wake for a feed but omfg he would hear nothing of it and become soooooooo cranky the next day I said fck it, he'll wake if hungry) he's 6 now and LOVES his sleep (still sleeps 12-13 hrs a night, he sometimes wakes for a bathroom run but goes right back to bed) and is a monster if he gets anything less. \n\nAll kids are different, and 8 months is not necessarily abnormal that a baby wakes up that often, but definitely talk to his pediatrician about it to make sure there's no medical reason.", "NTA\n\nYour husband sounds like he\u2019s already check out of your joint life, agree to the separation, you\u2019ll still be doing it all but it won\u2019t annoy you so much and will be better for your mental health than having to deal with his disrespect and lack of care.", "NTA.

We were both students when our oldest was born. I was in a grad program that was all afternoon classes. Our daughter was, and still is, a night owl. She would often go to sleep around 1 am. My husband had classes at 8 or 9 and I had nothing until 1pm. That meant that I stayed up and played fed and hung out with her and got her down between midnight and 1am. He got up with her around 6am and handled feeding and changing while I got some sleep. If he couldn\u2019t get her back to sleep before he had to leave then he would wake me up, but she would usually go back to sleep and he\u2019d leave for class. I would get her up in time to get ready before my classes (I taught classes and took classes) and we would do our hand off depending on our schedules that day. It worked really well for her and it split the workload between us. We would trade off in the evenings depending on our deadlines coming up and grandparents would watch her sometimes when we both had a a really heavy week. \nIf yours is waking up by 10:30 then that sounds like a pre bedtime nap at 8/8:30pm and it needs to be cut out probably, sorry.

Make sure he\u2019s getting a full bottle too right before bed so hunger isn\u2019t the issue constantly waking him up. I might get a saucer toy or jumper for him to play in during that time too as you move that very late nap. Since you can sleep in to some degree putting him down a bit later might let you sleep more in the mornings. \nHubby also helped make this kid so he gets to help with the resulting work that comes with babies.
