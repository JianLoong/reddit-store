(:**\n\nSo, for context, my (21f) roommate (23f) and I have been friends for a couple of years and just moved in together this summer. Before we moved in, we had the conversation about bills and all that, and had agreed to split everything 50/50. \n\nFast forward to just days after we move in, her car breaks down and she asks if she can use mine while it\u2019s being fixed. I had no issue with this and allowed her to use it just asking she help with gas, which she said she would do. After about a week, it was determined that her car wasn\u2019t worth fixing, so she junked it while I was at work, and told me when I was off that she had done so. I\u2019ll admit, I was a little stressed as I\u2019d been the one paying for most of the gas despite driving less than her, and on top of that she hadn\u2019t even asked if it was okay for her to sell her car, just assuming she\u2019d continue to use mine. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few months since then, and I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I have to wake up and tell her if I have a doctor\u2019s appointment, work, etc because she\u2019ll just be out with my car without saying a word to me. I also have gotten in my car at 5:30am for work and found it below E multiple times, and I haven\u2019t always had money then to fill up my tank.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m extremely stressed out, so I\u2019ve tried to talk to her about it, but she gets upset and blows me off. She even lied about putting gas in as well when I brought up that me and her bf are the only ones putting in gas, despite her using my car way more than I do.\n\nTonight was the final straw though. She picked me up from work as she\u2019d used my car during the day, and she told me she had family stuff tomorrow and I need to ask my dad for a ride home from work. My dad lives about 45 minutes away and has no reason to come to the town I live in. Let alone just to give me a ride home. I pointed this out and she seemed unhappy with that answer, saying she\u2019d see if she could find a ride but she can\u2019t promise anything. \n\nShe already owes me a good chunk of money for gas, and at this point and I can\u2019t handle the additional stress from having to constantly be left on  E, not having my car to run errands, go to work, the extra gas money, etc. So, someone suggested I just only put enough in to drive myself to work and home. \n\nI feel though like doing this might make me TA though because I did originally let her use my car, and the plan was even that I\u2019d sell mine to her and get myself a newer one (this hasn\u2019t happened yet), as I\u2019ve been wanting to do that for a while now. Also, I do make more than her as work between 40-60 hour work weeks while she works between 10-16, so she doesn\u2019t have much to contribute while still having spending money. (Both of our schedules are by choice). \n\nI didn\u2019t put gas in tonight despite being at a quarter tank, and I\u2019m not planning to till I\u2019m on e and need to get to work.\n\n**edit for context**\n\nmy bills are also much higher than hers (including car insurance which she doesn\u2019t pay for), hence why I work much more than she does. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1668070995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yr9qru/aita_for_leaving_my_car_on_e_so_my_roommate_cant/", "score": 174, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I added work because at 15 hrs/week she\u2019s got time to work things out. You offered her help and she has taken advantage of that.\nI understand you\u2019re roommates and that makes things worse when wanting to be confrontational but it needs to happen.

She can make her own arrangements. Set things up how you need and want them to be.

You aren't her only option and it's not your responsibility.", "If she crashes or damages or abandons your car because she doesn't put gas in then you are liable. \n\nShe is being aggressive about just filling it up which she should be doing along with paying you for continued use. \n\nShe will never pay you if she crashes it, that could be thousands you owe. She would not replace or even chip in for a new car. Even just speeding and parking tickets would go to you as the owner and you'd have to try and prove she was driving and then sue her personally to maybe get the money back. \n\nYou are really gambling on nothing bad happening because she is currently proving that she is not to be trusted.", "Give her 3 options:\n1. Buy your car from you immediately\n2. Stop using your car entirely and return any keys\n3. (Not recommended) Start a log of gas purchased and make it clear that you have complete priority and she can use it only when you don\u2019t want or need to, and only if she also pays you mileage and proves she is properly licensed and insured.

Let alone the money for the gas.\n\nBe firm, have a backbone and demand what is rightfully yours to begin with.", "She knows that you don\u2019t like conflict and she\u2019s using that against you. You MUST stand up for yourself, eventually she\u2019s not going to allow you to use \u201cher\u201d car at all. Take your key back! She\u2019s costing you money for gas and would financially set you back if she ever gets in an accident. Your car is also depreciating faster because of her constant usage.", "She reacts like that because she knows you don't like it and will try to avoid it in future.

This will only get worse and she is bleeding you dry - don't let her bark you into a corner.", "tell her she\u2019s not on your car insurance. You don\u2019t feel comfortable taking any more risks.  Consider not renewing your lease either and move on", "I wonder the same thing. In a way, it must be freeing to live that way \u2014 thinking only of oneself.

It\u2019s long overdue.\n\nOP, this is an optional problem.", "> But honestly, how do these people live with themselves?\n\n\nEither extremely comfortably due to the fact that everyone else in n their lives are doing all the heavy lifting, or super stressed out about the prospect of their webs coming crashing down if any of the people they are taking advantage put two and two together.", "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you actually have a friendship. \n\nFriends don\u2019t blatantly take advantage of friends in the way she is doing to you. \n\nThis also isn\u2019t a \u201cpetty\u201d matter. She is routinely taking what is most likely your most valuable physical asset without asking permission, or even giving you a heads up, and forcing you to find other means of transportation, all because she doesn\u2019t feel the need to get a new car (because she thinks of your car as hers at this point).", "She's not your friend, she's a user and she's using you.

Such an annoying hassle. You need to find a more direct way of saying \"you can't use my car, you need to ask every time\".", "Then she needs to get herself a car. Well, right now she has one, YOURS. You're the one without a car.", "Woops missed that line. I think you need to take possession of the keys and only hand them over on a case by case basis. The fact that your car was unavailable to you at times when you needed it is unacceptable. Then you can establish a clear timeline on when the vehicle is back.", "Because then I feel bad because I want her to have a life and be able to go out for things she wants/needs", "It is where I live (:\n\nAnd ik I just try to talk to her and she just won\u2019t have a conversation with me about it :/", "True! I definitely almost missed one today that I needed to get cleared for a new job \ud83d\ude05", "Stop people pleasing and stand up for yourself. She's going to keep taking the piss until you do.

I'd bet she's counting on you to feel guilty so she can continue to take advantage of the situation. \n\nThis isn't a topic that needs her input. You're completely in the right to just let her know this arrangement isn't working for you so she'll need to figure something else out. Period, no explanation required no matter what your agreement was before. Bringing up a possible arrangement for gas or offers to continue to share will just give her the opportunity to take advantage of your misplaced guilt. \n\nShe would have to figure this out anyway if she didn't have you -  like any other adult. Enabling her boundary crossing isn't doing either of you any good. Good luck!", "Then she needs to get herself a car. Well, right now she has one, YOURS. You're the one without a car. You just pay the insurance and petrol and maintenance for the car, but it's hers. Until you simply tell her to give the keys back, you will have to get another car for yourself.\n\nDo you get how twisted and weird that sounds?", "Stop being a doormat. Your roommate is actively degrading your quality of life. Have an adult conversation with her about the car and how she's taking advantage of your kindness. She can get a bicycle if she can't afford a car.", "Sometimes you have to have conversations that other people don't want to have.\n\nIf she won't have a conversation about asking before taking your car you can have the conversation where you take back your key.\n\nIs she aware that she is choosing to end your friendship through her selfish behaviour?", "Then leave her a note that says she either needs to stop using the car or pay up. \n\nYou dont need a conversation, this is your car, you can unilaterally decide who can and can't use it", "Because she knows she's way out of line.", "When u do see her, tell her u can no longer abuse me for my car.", "Doing that will send a clear message of who is in control here.", "Ah! Good point! I just want to be an adult and go to her as one. But if she\u2019s not willing to have the conversation then I don\u2019t have much choice.", "So be an adult and go to her. There's no conversation to be had here - you're telling her you're setting a boundary around your property. None of that requires her input. If she doesn't listen and takes the car out without your permission, call the cops and report the car stolen."]}
