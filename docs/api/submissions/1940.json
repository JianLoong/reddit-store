(:**\n\nSo, for context, my (21f) roommate (23f) and I have been friends for a couple of years and just moved in together this summer. Before we moved in, we had the conversation about bills and all that, and had agreed to split everything 50/50. \n\nFast forward to just days after we move in, her car breaks down and she asks if she can use mine while it\u2019s being fixed. I had no issue with this and allowed her to use it just asking she help with gas, which she said she would do. After about a week, it was determined that her car wasn\u2019t worth fixing, so she junked it while I was at work, and told me when I was off that she had done so. I\u2019ll admit, I was a little stressed as I\u2019d been the one paying for most of the gas despite driving less than her, and on top of that she hadn\u2019t even asked if it was okay for her to sell her car, just assuming she\u2019d continue to use mine. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few months since then, and I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I have to wake up and tell her if I have a doctor\u2019s appointment, work, etc because she\u2019ll just be out with my car without saying a word to me. I also have gotten in my car at 5:30am for work and found it below E multiple times, and I haven\u2019t always had money then to fill up my tank.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m extremely stressed out, so I\u2019ve tried to talk to her about it, but she gets upset and blows me off. She even lied about putting gas in as well when I brought up that me and her bf are the only ones putting in gas, despite her using my car way more than I do.\n\nTonight was the final straw though. She picked me up from work as she\u2019d used my car during the day, and she told me she had family stuff tomorrow and I need to ask my dad for a ride home from work. My dad lives about 45 minutes away and has no reason to come to the town I live in. Let alone just to give me a ride home. I pointed this out and she seemed unhappy with that answer, saying she\u2019d see if she could find a ride but she can\u2019t promise anything. \n\nShe already owes me a good chunk of money for gas, and at this point and I can\u2019t handle the additional stress from having to constantly be left on  E, not having my car to run errands, go to work, the extra gas money, etc. So, someone suggested I just only put enough in to drive myself to work and home. \n\nI feel though like doing this might make me TA though because I did originally let her use my car, and the plan was even that I\u2019d sell mine to her and get myself a newer one (this hasn\u2019t happened yet), as I\u2019ve been wanting to do that for a while now. Also, I do make more than her as work between 40-60 hour work weeks while she works between 10-16, so she doesn\u2019t have much to contribute while still having spending money. (Both of our schedules are by choice). \n\nI didn\u2019t put gas in tonight despite being at a quarter tank, and I\u2019m not planning to till I\u2019m on e and need to get to work.\n\n**edit for context**\n\nmy bills are also much higher than hers (including car insurance which she doesn\u2019t pay for), hence why I work much more than she does. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1668070995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yr9qru/aita_for_leaving_my_car_on_e_so_my_roommate_cant/", "score": 1334, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not her car, and you as the owner are responsible for her actions while driving it. You need to protect yourself.", "Have you checked that she is even covered under your insurance?

I added work because at 15 hrs/week she\u2019s got time to work things out. You offered her help and she has taken advantage of that.\nI understand you\u2019re roommates and that makes things worse when wanting to be confrontational but it needs to happen.

First, quick question. You mentioned she doesn\u2019t pay for car insurance so does that mean she\u2019s not even insured at all as a driver? Because if that\u2019s the case, she\u2019s driving your car as an uninsured person and most insurance companies do not allow someone to drive another persons car if they aren\u2019t on the owners insurance unless they are insured by another company and of a certain age. \n\nAlso, if she\u2019s uninsured then how does she even have her license still active?\n\nFor example I was on progressive for a long time under my mom\u2019s name and was a listed driver and also had my own car. But when I would go somewhere with my grandma, she\u2019d let me drive her car and she is insured with Allstate. When we called them to find out the logistics, they said that as long as I had verbal consent from my grandma and that I was insured through another company then it was okay for me to drive her car. But if I was not insured and was under the age of 25, even with verbal consent, I wasn\u2019t allowed to drive her car. I know that probably sounds weird but that\u2019s how they explained it to us back when I was 18. I\u2019m 29 now so it could be different now. \n\nBut if she is uninsured then you will be responsible for any tickets or damages to your car as well as a higher insurance deductible. So if I were you, I\u2019d definitely quit letting her use your car. \n\nAlso how is she going to be able to buy your car when she works less hours than you? Like way less hours? 10-16 hours (unless she\u2019s making over $15 an hour) there\u2019s no way she has enough money to buy the car off of you. Especially if she\u2019s even having issues with putting gas in the car right now. \n\nFurthermore, her just up and taking your car without letting you know about it is theft (in my opinion) even though you told her she could borrow your car as long as she put gas in it. Also her telling you that she\u2019s taking YOUR car to family stuff and that YOU\u2019D need to ask for a ride from your dad who lives 45 minutes away is absolutely absurd of her to even pull with you. She\u2019s acting entitled like the car is hers. She also acts like it\u2019s a bane of her existence to even let you use your OWN car. Like she is not a friend to you whatsoever and is a leech. Definitely quit letting her using your car and see if you can find another apartment with another roommate. Because like I said, she is not your friend.

End of story.", "Lying about not having the car is just prolonging this woman's distress and enabling the roommate's bad behaviour. Plus, the OP needn't feel guilty about not letting someone else use **her** car. The roommate is in the wrong, self-centered and probably this is not the only thing she does to show her true colours. IT\"S NOT HER CAR!", "Stolen partial comment.  Bad bot!", "Stolen comment.", "I KNOW!!! Who does that?? Most parents won't even add their own kids to their insurance. Very irresponsible of OP.", "I was horrified when I read that. I don\u2019t even want to think about how much that probably added to OP\u2019s premium. So that\u2019s even more money spent to make it possible for the roommate to drive OP\u2019s car, when she won\u2019t even pay for gas, let alone car payments or wear/tear and maintenance costs.", "Does she pay half of the living expenses too? I'm real confused why you live together and you work 40+ hours and she picks 16 hr work weeks...", "Is she paying for insurance? What about tyres, servicing etc.", "OP has difficulty with confrontation as she has stated in other posts.  This way she avoids confrontation as the car is beyond access and allows OP to set a new normal where the car does not exist, is not available to the \"friend\".\n\nIt will make it easier to start anew.  But in all honesty, with friends like that, who needs enemies.", "Boyfriend I assume", "Nothing about this so far is you being an adult. Make your keys and car unavailable to her and when she finally gets around to asking you about it, which she will, say \u201cI\u2019m no longer allowing you to borrow my car.\u201d \n\n\nEnd of fucking discussion. Remember not to JADE!"]}
