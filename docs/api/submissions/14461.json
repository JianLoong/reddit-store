HOWEVER, the whole \"we have no reason to interact anymore, she gets no say at my house\" is absolute bullshit. You are BOTH parents of a child, TOGETHER. A safe trip with another family is not a huge deal but she does have a right to know, what if he had an accident and got injured, and she had no idea why he was around firearms? there are plenty of situations that do still need to be discussed.", "I personally am not into hunting, I target shoot.  But, there are people who enjoy it, and as long as he has a license, it is a legal activity.  I do have to ask if he has taken a firearms safety course and a first aid course.  I assume you send him with, or someone has a satellite phone if in an area with no coverage.  As long as he is prepared, I see no problem, and wonder if she is just trying to annoy you.  In less than 2 years, the kid can make his own decisions.  \n\n\nWhy does she object?  Do they use the meat?  I have no patience for \"sport\" hunting, but using the meat is a different issue.  Does she dislike guns?  This is where a firearms safety course could come in to play.   Some people know only what they hear on the news and think every kid who can shoot will turn into a mass murderer.  Would she object if you went too?    \n\n\nYour girlfriend is right, however.  You do have to have some communication.  What if he were in a car wreck and decisions needed to be made?  Only the parent whose days are custody days makes the decision?  Try to find out her objections, and meet them, but I don't understand her drama.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily wrong for letting him go, but you are wrong for your outlook on parenting your son with her. You guys are absolutely partners who both play a role in raising your son. Treat her with respect, she is important to your son regardless of your feelings about her. Love him enough to be nice and considerate to her. If you let him go knowing it would bother her, that was the wrong decision.", "I\u2018m struggling here: If I had kids, I wouldn\u2019t want someone to take them hunting (or operating a firearm under different circumstances) behind my back.\n\nBut I\u2019m also aware that there is a huge cultural component to this. I am European, giving a minor access to a Gun is also wildly illegal here.\n\nI, one the other hand, would give my 16 year old kid access to beer and wine, which probably outrages half of the (American) comment section.\n\nIt really depends on how \u201enormal\u201c hunting and firearms are. From your attitude towards it, I\u2019m guessing: very normal.\n\nHence, NTA", "YTA \n\nUntil your son is an adult, you AND his mother are co-parents. \n\nHunting isn\u2019t the core issue here. The real issue is that you undercut the other parent. You\u2019re creating an environment where the child can now play the parents against each other. \n\nThe rules and boundaries need to be consistent between the parents, and consistently enforced. Where you disagree on an issue, you should work it out and get on the same page before allowing or restricting something for the kid. \n\nAgain, hunting isn\u2019t the issue. It is your complete disregard for co-parenting effectively. Like it or not, at least until he\u2019s an adult you ARE still connected to his mother.", "NTA.\n\nBased just on what you've told us, there's not good reason to not allow your child to go on a hunting trip.  I'm from a family of hunters that live in a rural area so MOST families around here hunt during one season or another, so I may be biased. But, realistically, as long as you know that he's prepared enough to handle a weapon, will be safe, and trust the people he was with to have good hunting/safety practices then there's absolutely nothing wrong with letting him go. Regardless of your ex's opinion.", "NTA\\*\n\n\\*As long as all laws were obeyed and all necessary precautions were taken, you have done nothing wrong.\n\nIf not, your ex can (and maybe should) use this as evidence against you in a custody hearing.

It happens to be a hobby she doesn't approve of; so the issue lies there with her not liking hunting, while you're fine with it. \n\nYou should let her know when he leaves for Emergency contact purposes. That's different than saying he can/can't go. I would say the same of a band trip or any other extracurricular that spans multiple nights. \n\nUltimately, all decisions come down to; what's best for the child? I assume this was in the child's best interest and something the kid wanted to do.", "NTA.  You need to leave opinions about guns and hunting out of it and understand this is a common and legal activity.  A 16 year old is old enough to agree to it.", "I grew up in a town where it was normal to have guns and go hunting. For most people, gun safety was a part of life. You learned the basics as a small child. You also learned that you couldn\u2019t go hunting with just anyone. There were those that didn\u2019t follow the rules and would even get drunk af while hunting. Then drive home. \n\nBased on my personal experience, this is something you definitely should have cleared with him mom, after vetting the family, learning about their rules around hunting and handling firearms, and explaining what you learned to your wife. And you should have made sure your son knew what he was doing and how to conduct himself on a hunting trip. You don\u2019t mention doing any of that.

I don't think YTA for taking your 16 year old son hunting, however:\n\nAs a co-parent, if your ex-wife had done something that you thought was potentially dangerous for your kid, would you not react similarly as your ex-wife did?\n\nYour ex-wife reacted to news where she understands your shared child might have been in a dangerous situation.  Instead of alleviating her fears and explaining that your son was in a safe situation, you shut down communication with her and told her off.\n\nyour girlfriend is right, you should maintain a better co-parenting relationship with your ex-wife.  You should also consult with your son's mother on any potentially dangerous activity and hunting certainly falls under that category despite all the safety precautions that exist.", "Info: What does your custody agreement say on first right of refusal? Because that changes a lot of the ruling, 16 or not.", "NTA.\n\nYour son *wanted* to go, it was with his friends family, one that is clearly trustworthy enough to bring weapons around your kid without endangering him.", "I find it disheartening how many comments I see attacking OP as if he did this intentionally to spite his ex. The son *wanted* to go on this trip, which should count a lot here. OP just did what he thought was best for his son. I certainly can't speak from personal experience, but it doesn't seem reasonable to expect every decision to be made together. It seems to me in OP's head this trip was a trivial decision and not some big decision, which is why he didn't feel the need to notify his ex. NTA", "Soft YTA. He was in fact NOT in your house/care during the hunting trip (so my house, my rules doesn\u2019t apply).

Even the best hunters can have accidents and it would have been a lot better if she wasn\u2019t caught blind-sided if something had happened.", "Eek this is difficult for me. Mum doesn\u2019t know whether this family have safe conduct around weapons, have shown your son how to be safe around weapons and hasn\u2019t been told that he\u2019s on an excursion where weapons were involved and if there had been an incident, that would have been the first time she had knowledge of it. \n\nMy questions, do you know what training these people have had using weapons and whether they do it safely and have you personally ensured that they/your child have the right knowledge and training in the use of the weapons?", "Nta. He's 16 she can get over it", "NTA. A 16 year is old enough to communicate his plans to his Mother. It's obvious why he didn't want to tell her.", "YTA. I say this as someone raised in a community that does lots of hunting, hunt without a firearm myself, and am married to a waterfowl hunter. I know my future children will go out hunting with my husband and his family and encourage it. I also know that there are possible dangers associated with it, especially with guns. I know that my husband and father in law are extremely cautious with gun safety, and the understanding is that they will be present whenever are children are using firearms because I don\u2019t trust just anyone to enforce proper gun safety. Your ex is valid in being angry about not being consulted about your son going hunting. No matter how careful you are out hunting there is always risk, and she most likely doesn\u2019t even know the people he is out with. In my opinion, having children going out hunting needs to be a two yes situation because of the risks. I understand it would be very disappointing for your son to miss out on these experiences, but your ex is still his mother so she has a say.", "YTA. Yes you DO need to coparent especially when it comes to an underage child who is hanging out with strangers (strangers to your exwife) with guns.

A riskier activity def warrants two yeses", "YTA  \n\n\nWhile he is a minor, you both absolutely have a say and a sincere interest in what goes on in one another's households as it relates to your child. Try to imagine your feelings if your ex let people who were strangers to you take your son on an activity that you felt was too adult or too dangerous.  \n\n\nYou also say that there is no need for you to interact together. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you two will have to interact with one another as long as your son is walking this earth. Interaction will decrease as your son ages, but it will definitely happen, especially in times of celebration and crisis.  \n\n\nCo-parenting is really hard.

It's not like you told him he could go hitchhike across the country or something ridiculous like that. If he was 12, I would say it's a different story, but in a lot of the country, it would be perfectly legal for him to go do that by himself without either parents consent.

It was beyond tragic. Dead deer, starving deer stripping bark to eat, killing trees and dying anyway. Never saw anything like it and hope I never do again.\n\nOverpopulation is insanely cruel. We've already screwed up the natural balance in a dozen different ways. Hunting keeps it inside a limit where they can live and thrive.\n\nAgain. I'm genuinely not being combative or a jerk. There's just a lot more to it than killing for sport", "I've never hunted in my life and most likely never will, but assuming that they eat what they kill and hunt responsibly in the proper season, they are putting animals through less trauma than purchasing meat through the factory farm industry, and may actually be doing a service to cull populations that could otherwise get out of hand and cause negative environmental repercussions (i.e., keeping deer populations low enough that they, as a whole, have adequate food and aren't overgrazing, or culling wild hogs that can cause lots of problems otherwise).", "Not necessarily.

Sure, you may fall more on skateboarding, but that primarily leads to scrapes and bruises, with fractures occurring less so. With a helmet, head injuries should be minimized, which is the greatest danger. The more serious injuries often come from doing more difficult tricks, so most injuries in a normal course of skateboarding aren't life-threatening. \n\nHunting, however, may have fewer injuries, but if there is an accident with a gun, you are much more likely to need serious treatment and a higher chance of injuries that could be life-threatening. Both have risks, but just because there are fewer incidents doesn't speak to the overall risk of danger. There are sports that have more injuries in terms of amount than (American) football, but people will focus more on injuries in football since the injuries they do have will often involve the head or neck, which makes them more serious and dangerous than a twisted ankle, for example.", "And what are the nature and level if injuries?

And we don't know that that was the case here. Where I live, most hunters aren't that far from either a town or at least some farm houses. And you can assume that because a gun is involved then that means automatically the dangers are worse but that's not true across the board.

It\u2019s definitely best to make nice with your ex and at least try to get along, instead of being very rude to her and making the na\u00efve assumption you just don\u2019t have to talk to her anymore. Even after he\u2019s grown, there will be many big life events in the future where he will want both his parents present, and being a jerk now just makes things more uncomfortable and complicated for him. It sounds like you\u2019re hoping he\u2019ll choose you over her as he gets older, but that\u2019s honestly not a gamble you should be wanting to take. As far as making decisions together, that\u2019s a given, and I\u2019m sure you would feel differently if she was letting him do something you absolutely didn\u2019t approve of. It at least would have been reasonable to tell her he was going on that trip instead of letting her find out later.", "Yta - I\u2019m a hunter and in my opinion, the mother is overreacting. However, I can also understand *why* she\u2019s overreacting. Her son was either using or was at least in the presence of a firearm, and that may make a parent feel worried for the safety of their child. She has the right to know where her kid is, and therefore, you should\u2019ve told her. \n\nAlso, your girlfriend is right. You should try to keep peace with your kid\u2019s mother, as constantly fighting with her will negatively impact her life, your life, and most importantly, your son\u2019s life.", "You have to interact until one of you dies honestly.\n\nBirthdays.\n\nChristmas.\n\nEaster.\n\nDeaths.\n\nMarriges.\n\nBirths.\n\nGrandchildren.\n\nYou may not have to talk on a day to day basis, but you still have to have contact every now and then. Maybe you should grow up and look at that.\n\nJust saying. YTA.", "YTA- there are plenty of horror stories about people being shot while on hunting trips, she\u2019s not being dramatic asking for your permission. And your son is BOTH of your responsibility until he turns 18. If you want what is best for your kid (especially in a situation where both parents are active in his life), suck it the fuck up. Things go a lot smother when the parents work together, stop antagonizing her and apologize. It\u2019ll save you on therapy costs down the road.", "100%.  I am perfectly okay with HUNTING guns when used responsibly and and with hunting.  And I still would not allow my spawnlet to go hunting with anyone I had not fully vetted on their gun safety knowledge and been hunting with myself at least 3 or 4 times to know for sure they knew how to properly handle the firearms.\n\nListen to your GF.  She's right.  Whatever your ex's reasons are in this scenario, she absolutely gets a say in what happens to HER child.  Take L here and apologize and open an adult conversation with her.  And not just about this, either.  If you two are this far apart on one issue, we know this is not the only one.", "The problem is, their relationship in general seems to be antagonistic. And unless OP is leaving stuff out, she too is making unilateral decisions and any \"compromise/co-parenting\" boils down to her getitng her way.", "Yeah, bow or gun, I would want to know if my child knows how to handle the weapon safely and will be around people with the same skill. If that's the mother's concern, I'm on her side.\n\nBut if she has a moral issue with hunting, as an ecologist, I'm on OPs side.\n\nBut OP, YTA for your views on co parenting. Hope your season is good and you bag whatever it is you're going after.", "I agree. Canadian as welll living in a high hunting area.\n\nIf my kid had no prior experience with guns or had no certificate etc. there\u2019d be no way I\u2019d let him go off with others, especially other teens, that I didn\u2019t know. \n\nIts like people forget that guns for hunting are made for killing. \n\nIf your kid isn\u2019t experienced and you don\u2019t know the people they are going with?!?!? That\u2019s crazy. \n\nIt would be a different story if my kid was an experienced hunter with all his proper certifications and whatnot, as well as going with a family that I knew and trusted to be likewise responsible gun owners. \n\nPeople that argue about kids and cars also maybe forget that they need to be licensed to drive a vehicle as well. A 16y old isn\u2019t just given free reign with a car with their teen friends with no experience and no license. The argument is ridiculous.", "Hard disagree, yeah OP was kind of a DB in explaining it to his ex, but what he said was true. Especially if 2 people have opposite views on something like going hunting. The kid is 16 and at the appropriate age to make some of his decisions on his own like this. NTA", "Horseshit. The rules are never the same between two different households nor should they be. Allowing your ex to overrule your judgment in your own home, during your time with your child, is absurd.", ">He\u2019s still a minor and you are still coparenting, so you have to work   \ntogether and dismissing her completely and portraying yourself as the   \n\u201ccool\u201d dad that let\u2019s your kid do whatever he wants without his mother\u2019s  \n approval is asshole territory.v\n\nYou're acting like the only reason OP allowed the trip was because the big bad evil husband wanted to spite his poor little ex wife.", "I wouldn\u2019t say the activity was *extremely* dangerous, but it was definitely dangerous. And although I think the mother was overreacting, OP definitely should\u2019ve told her about the trip beforehand. She has the right to know where her son is.", "Its AITA. Anything a husband does here must be either abusive or intentionally trying to spite his wife. /s", "Too be fair. It\u2019s more likely to drown in a pool than die hunting. If the kid is at his moms and wants to go to the pool does she need to ask OPs opinion?", "The kid is 16. By the time anything is changed he\u2019ll be 18 and there won\u2019t be a custody agreement.", "Again that's too much, and I highly doubt a judge would go for it. Also this is made up by you. I'm sure his dad's smart enough to handle making an appropriate decision.", "There's nothing in OP's post to indicate his son has a hunting license or is trained in hunting safety.", "No, she does not. He does not have to inform his ex any time his kid wants to go out with friends. She also has no right to try and say that the kid isn't allowed to go hunting anymore. He is old enough to decide what hobbies he wants to involve himself in", "Being a divorced parent once they get to this age when they are with the other parent unless what they are doing is illegal or terribly dangerous , you really don\u2019t get a say.  I mean you can say something but chances are your being over ruled.", "Maybe if the son and mom talked more she would know about the hunting trip. If I was going on a trip soon that is 100% something that would come up in conversation naturally", "Or they saw that OP was a man and had to paint him as an abusive husband or smth", ">She doesn't want him to go again, she thinks this is a decision that should have been made jointly, etc.\n\nThe issue with this, which many are missing. For her making a decision \"jointly\" appears to be one where she gets to decide and the others get to jointly go along with it.", "> keeping say, the deer population at a certain level they all risk starvation\n\nIf only there was a way for nature to balance things put naturally.\n\nOh wait, there is, starvation one year reduces the population leading to a self correcting amount, until theres another food shortage / food surplus which changes the numbers again.\n\nThe 'but we have to be the ones to balance nature' is hunter bs", "You realize the two things aren't mutually exclusive right? You can hunt as a hobby for the food. And her 'communication ' was trying to say he couldn't go again. It seems to me like in her mind co-parenting is only co-parenting if she has the final say on the matter.", "We don't know what state this is in or if they're following the law. It's probably a reasonable assumption they're following the law but we don't know what state or even country they're in.", "The kid could have also just been simply tagging along for the trip. I\u2019ve probably been on around 30 hunting trips with friends and family, and have not fired a firearm on a single one of them it was more hair camping and hiking for me. I can\u2019t remember the laws in my state but I\u2019ve had my basic hunters safety since I was 10 and I went through the course with my younger sister and cousin at the time.", "What you are talking about is called poaching... not hunting...", "Then they were poachers. Poaching will lose you the right to hunt and own firearms.", "It's just as likely his son has had firearms classes and has gone hunting with dad and his friends family before so dad wasn't worried. Without more info we can't say for sure either way."]}
