HOWEVER, the whole \"we have no reason to interact anymore, she gets no say at my house\" is absolute bullshit. You are BOTH parents of a child, TOGETHER. A safe trip with another family is not a huge deal but she does have a right to know, what if he had an accident and got injured, and she had no idea why he was around firearms? there are plenty of situations that do still need to be discussed.", "I personally am not into hunting, I target shoot.  But, there are people who enjoy it, and as long as he has a license, it is a legal activity.  I do have to ask if he has taken a firearms safety course and a first aid course.  I assume you send him with, or someone has a satellite phone if in an area with no coverage.  As long as he is prepared, I see no problem, and wonder if she is just trying to annoy you.  In less than 2 years, the kid can make his own decisions.  \n\n\nWhy does she object?  Do they use the meat?  I have no patience for \"sport\" hunting, but using the meat is a different issue.  Does she dislike guns?  This is where a firearms safety course could come in to play.   Some people know only what they hear on the news and think every kid who can shoot will turn into a mass murderer.  Would she object if you went too?    \n\n\nYour girlfriend is right, however.  You do have to have some communication.  What if he were in a car wreck and decisions needed to be made?  Only the parent whose days are custody days makes the decision?  Try to find out her objections, and meet them, but I don't understand her drama.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily wrong for letting him go, but you are wrong for your outlook on parenting your son with her. You guys are absolutely partners who both play a role in raising your son. Treat her with respect, she is important to your son regardless of your feelings about her. Love him enough to be nice and considerate to her. If you let him go knowing it would bother her, that was the wrong decision.", "I\u2018m struggling here: If I had kids, I wouldn\u2019t want someone to take them hunting (or operating a firearm under different circumstances) behind my back.\n\nBut I\u2019m also aware that there is a huge cultural component to this. I am European, giving a minor access to a Gun is also wildly illegal here.\n\nI, one the other hand, would give my 16 year old kid access to beer and wine, which probably outrages half of the (American) comment section.\n\nIt really depends on how \u201enormal\u201c hunting and firearms are. From your attitude towards it, I\u2019m guessing: very normal.\n\nHence, NTA", "YTA \n\nUntil your son is an adult, you AND his mother are co-parents. \n\nHunting isn\u2019t the core issue here. The real issue is that you undercut the other parent. You\u2019re creating an environment where the child can now play the parents against each other. \n\nThe rules and boundaries need to be consistent between the parents, and consistently enforced. Where you disagree on an issue, you should work it out and get on the same page before allowing or restricting something for the kid. \n\nAgain, hunting isn\u2019t the issue. It is your complete disregard for co-parenting effectively. Like it or not, at least until he\u2019s an adult you ARE still connected to his mother.", "NTA.\n\nBased just on what you've told us, there's not good reason to not allow your child to go on a hunting trip.  I'm from a family of hunters that live in a rural area so MOST families around here hunt during one season or another, so I may be biased. But, realistically, as long as you know that he's prepared enough to handle a weapon, will be safe, and trust the people he was with to have good hunting/safety practices then there's absolutely nothing wrong with letting him go. Regardless of your ex's opinion.", "NTA\\*\n\n\\*As long as all laws were obeyed and all necessary precautions were taken, you have done nothing wrong.\n\nIf not, your ex can (and maybe should) use this as evidence against you in a custody hearing.

It happens to be a hobby she doesn't approve of; so the issue lies there with her not liking hunting, while you're fine with it. \n\nYou should let her know when he leaves for Emergency contact purposes. That's different than saying he can/can't go. I would say the same of a band trip or any other extracurricular that spans multiple nights. \n\nUltimately, all decisions come down to; what's best for the child? I assume this was in the child's best interest and something the kid wanted to do.", "NTA.  You need to leave opinions about guns and hunting out of it and understand this is a common and legal activity.  A 16 year old is old enough to agree to it.", "I grew up in a town where it was normal to have guns and go hunting. For most people, gun safety was a part of life. You learned the basics as a small child. You also learned that you couldn\u2019t go hunting with just anyone. There were those that didn\u2019t follow the rules and would even get drunk af while hunting. Then drive home. \n\nBased on my personal experience, this is something you definitely should have cleared with him mom, after vetting the family, learning about their rules around hunting and handling firearms, and explaining what you learned to your wife. And you should have made sure your son knew what he was doing and how to conduct himself on a hunting trip. You don\u2019t mention doing any of that.

I don't think YTA for taking your 16 year old son hunting, however:\n\nAs a co-parent, if your ex-wife had done something that you thought was potentially dangerous for your kid, would you not react similarly as your ex-wife did?  \n\nYour wife reacted to news where she understands your shared child might have been in a dangerous situation.  Instead of alleviating her fears and explaining that your son was in a safe situation, you shut down communication with her and told her off.\n\nyour girlfriend is right, you should maintain a better co-parenting relationship with your ex-wife.  You should also consult with your son's mother on any potentially dangerous activity and hunting certainly falls under that category despite all the safety precautions that exist.", "Info: What does your custody agreement say on first right of refusal? Because that changes a lot of the ruling, 16 or not.", "NTA.\n\nYour son *wanted* to go, it was with his friends family, one that is clearly trustworthy enough to bring weapons around your kid without endangering him.", "I find it disheartening how many comments I see attacking OP as if he did this intentionally to spite his ex. The son *wanted* to go on this trip, which should count a lot here. OP just did what he thought was best for his son. I certainly can't speak from personal experience, but it doesn't seem reasonable to expect every decision to be made together. It seems to me in OP's head this trip was a trivial decision and not some big decision, which is why he didn't feel the need to notify his ex. NTA", "Soft YTA. He was in fact NOT in your house/care during the hunting trip (so my house, my rules doesn\u2019t apply).

Even the best hunters can have accidents and it would have been a lot better if she wasn\u2019t caught blind-sided if something had happened.", "Eek this is difficult for me.

He's 16 she can get over it", "NTA. A 16 year is old enough to communicate his plans to his Mother. It's obvious why he didn't want to tell her.", "YTA. I say this as someone raised in a community that does lots of hunting, hunt without a firearm myself, and am married to a waterfowl hunter. I know my future children will go out hunting with my husband and his family and encourage it. I also know that there are possible dangers associated with it, especially with guns. I know that my husband and father in law are extremely cautious with gun safety, and the understanding is that they will be present whenever are children are using firearms because I don\u2019t trust just anyone to enforce proper gun safety. Your ex is valid in being angry about not being consulted about your son going hunting. No matter how careful you are out hunting there is always risk, and she most likely doesn\u2019t even know the people he is out with. In my opinion, having children going out hunting needs to be a two yes situation because of the risks. I understand it would be very disappointing for your son to miss out on these experiences, but your ex is still his mother so she has a say.", "YTA. Yes you DO need to coparent especially when it comes to an underage child who is hanging out with strangers (strangers to your exwife) with guns.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but you two will have to interact with one another as long as your son is walking this earth. Interaction will decrease as your son ages, but it will definitely happen, especially in times of celebration and crisis.  \n\n\nCo-parenting is really hard.

It's not like you told him he could go hitchhike across the country or something ridiculous like that. If he was 12, I would say it's a different story, but in a lot of the country, it would be perfectly legal for him to go do that by himself without either parents consent.

I wouldn't necessarily mind it if their first hunting trip were without me, either. But, if they expressed interest in hunting, you BET I would make ABSOLUTELY SURE they got shooting classes at a range first, and understood what is or isn't risky, and I'd sit down and talk to them about ethics and all those things. Once I knew they were good on stuff like that and wouldn't pick up any crappy habits or something, them going hunting with their friends wouldn't be an issue.
