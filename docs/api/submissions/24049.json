Our relationship was long distance for a year until he proposed 3 months ago and I just made the move to his country. As we were long distance I didn\u2019t get the chance to meet most of his family yet so D had the idea for us all to spend a weekend together at his family\u2019s lake house. The 1st day was great, we had dinner, drank wine, talked and they all seemed to like me and accept me into the family.\n\nLater that night D and I were doing you know what but keeping quiet because we didn\u2019t want to disturb anyone. I remember thinking I heard a noise outside the room and we stopped for a minute and didn\u2019t hear anything else so we continued, finished, took a shower together and then it was lights out.\n\nThe problem came the next morning when my future FIL came up to me. After some small talk he said \u201cWell, tonight when you and D are messing around try and keep it down\u201d. I apologised profusely for disturbing him and then he said \u201cNo don\u2019t apologise, it\u2019s natural. I\u2019d be doing the same if I had woman like you in my bed. I\u2019m just jealous. Not every man has a woman willing to wear his initials so proudly \n\nThat last line let me know he had to have been watching us. D and I had gotten each others initials tattooed one night when we were drunk and mine was on my ass. It clicked for me then that when I had heard a noise the night before, I was on top facing away from the door and my tattoo would have been in full view. I felt sick and went to the bathroom to call my best friend. She said that D might have told her about the tattoos and not to jump to conclusions.\n\nLater that night I asked D if he had told anyone about our tattoos and he said no, why? I burst into tears in front of him. He asked me what was wrong and I told him what his Dad had said to me. He told me to stay in our room and he was gone for about 30 mins. When he came back he told me to pack my bag and that we were leaving. I asked what happened and he wouldn\u2019t answer me\n\nOn the drive home D told me he confronted his father who insisted he didn\u2019t watch us but MIL had cameras. Apparently FIL could be seen walking down the hallway to our room and walking back 7 minutes later with his pants undone. I felt sick. As far as I know FIL has been kicked out of the house. \n\nMy relationship with D is strained, we aren\u2019t really talking. I am worried I have ruined my relationships with my in-laws. My best friend and my sister both said I shouldn\u2019t have said anything and that a 20+ year marriage is ending because of me? I also told them about how my relationship with D now feels strained and they have told me to prepare myself to move back home because they don\u2019t think he\u2019ll go through with the wedding now. I think I did the right thing but I am so worried about what the future is going to look like for us all now.

He was the creep watching his child and future daughter in law have sex. He was the one making inappropriate remarks. Soooo, how exactly are you to blame for this? NTA, of course.", "NTA and there is NO WAY that this is an isolated incident.  MIL was likely looking for a way out.  You\u2019ll see FIL will be gone and the rest will work out.   You feel violated and rightfully so.", "NTA. Hes a freaking pervert.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. That is just so violating, I'm sure you feel sick.

He was so brazen, I'd be surprised if that's his first offense - probably the straw that broke the marriage. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. You are not responsible for his behavior, which is predatory and appalling. I don't know if I could marry into a family with him as part of it! \n\nAnd, F your best friend and sister. Dude ruined his own marriage. And would you want to be married to a guy who did that?! If you found out your partner was like this, would you continue the marriage?! \n\nYou should not be shamed to be quiet and live with your discomfort because other people want to mistakenly blame you for his actions. You did do the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYour fiance is likely in shock and rage. You did nothing wrong. Your sister and best friend are total AHs. Seriously, where is the support? So, you should be ok with your future FIL perving on you? This was likely not the first time. Ask yourself, who has cameras in their home????? This predates you. Hang in there.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s not your fault his dad is a pervert.

I\u2019m not sure what type of world they live in, but you are NTA!  If they think that kind of violation is acceptable\u2026.well, that\u2019s another problem in itself. You can\u2019t get a new sister (or you can if you\u2019re not that close), but you can ditch the \u2018friend\u2019.  What FIL did was just messed up, creepy & gross. How do they even justify what he did?\n\nYou did the right thing by telling your fianc\u00e9. Your relationship my feel strained, but don\u2019t forget that he is now dealing with something he should never ever have to deal with. He basically lost his father when he saw that video.  Just be there for him. \n\nAnd as for MIL, you saved her bacon!  She doesn\u2019t have to live with that creep anymore, because this can\u2019t be a one off occurrence.", "NTA Wow! I am so sorry you are dealing with this. Your fiance did great, and anyone who is calling you an ah needs their head examined. That was straight up sexual predatory behavior! I am so glad your fiance and his mom are in your corner. I am pretty sure this is NOT the first time she has experienced or witnessed deviant sexual or kink sexual behavior from her husband.  I think this incident may have provided proof to her for suspicious behavior he's been doing for years. EVEN if it is the FIRST time for this, it's creepy, stalkerish and horrendously inappropriate behavior to be a voyeuer to your own son and daughter in law. YIKES. \n\nI get why his mom called it quits, nobody wants to be partner to a predator/stalker especially their own offspring. It's genuinely disturbing behavior and should NOT BE EXCUSED, regardless of whether they've been married20 years or 50 years! If they do something with this level of \"ick\", how  can that be defended? It's like \"oh, I found out my hubby mur03red someone in cold blood for fun, but I'm sticking with him because.. married 30 years...\"  That's just...NOPE behavior NO. MATTER. WHAT. \n\nI understand your relationship feels strained right now, because you and your partner were unwilling victims in a creepy voyeuer's jolly session, and that's going to create some tension because it was his father. Please keep communicating about it, also, check in on his mom frequently as well. If you still have trouble processing through it in a month or so, go talk to a counselor/family therapist. This was traumatizing, even though you found out AFTER the incident, it STILL violated your boundaries, and will take some time to get through it. It's not extreme or repeated trauma, but  it being perpetrated by a trusted family member creates a large amount of distrust and \"ick\" that still needs to be worked through.\n\nGood luck and glad to hear your bf and his mom are both in your corner.", "NTA by any means and I\u2019m sorry this happened. You did the right thing by speaking up. He is the only one responsible for ending his 20+ year marriage and being a pervy.

I hope it works out for the two of you.", "*I am worried I have ruined my relationships with my in-laws.*\n\nYour former FIL ruined it by watching you and jerking off while you were having sex with his son\n\n*My best friend and my sister both said I shouldn\u2019t have said anything and that a 20+ year marriage is ending because of me*\n\nYou need better friends. What your former FIL did is a massive invasion of privacy and crossed so many boundaries that I don't even know where to start. \n\n*they have told me to prepare myself to move back home because they don\u2019t think he\u2019ll go through with the wedding now.*\n\nIf your fiance blames you in any way for any of this, dump his ass and GTFO. The 2 of you need to sit down and discuss this so you find out asap. That would be a massive betrayal by him, blaming the victim. \n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA. He's a creep and needed to be outed.  I can guarantee he has engaged in creepy behaviour before.", "NTA Had you not said anything\u2026.Would you want to be  married into this family and seeing future FIL all the time knowing what he said? Do you think it would be the last time? You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You shared with the man you\u2019re planning to spend your life with something important that made you extremely uncomfortable. He learned his dad is a creep. That\u2019s enough to trouble anyone. He\u2019s grieving right now the loss of that relationship. His view of his dad has been shattered. It\u2019s his dads fault. Not yours. His father behaved like  a gross pervert.", "OMG NOO! Op if he breaks up with you because of this please know you dodged a billet. His own father was getting off to watching his son have intercourse! Idk how much grosser you could get! If my husband was like idc if we\u2019ve been married for 50 years I would want to know what a sick pervert man he was so I could stay away. Please know that this isn\u2019t your fault. As for D this is probably really hard for him, that\u2019s his dad. He needs time to process this and he probably needs therapy. This is something that will take time and don\u2019t take it too personally right now that he is distant. I really hope things get better and you guys can work through this.", "NTA- don\u2019t listen to your friend and sister .\n\nI doubt this was the first time your fianc\u00e9\u2019s mother caught her husband being inappropriate.

It's ending because he's a pervert.  \n\nHow dare your sister and friend blame you!  I'm actually angry on your behalf. It's not your fault. YOU did nothing wrong.\n\nThis is completely on the man who watched and jacked off over watching you and his son.\n\nYour bf probably has no idea what to say or do. His father violated you both.
