YTA You can split up and pay 100 % again.", "YTA. If you were not ok with being a parent to step kids, you should never have started dating this man. I have two kids who live with their dad out of state. I travel back and forth to see them. My husband knew from the very beginning that I had kids and if he had not been ok with that, it never would have progressed. You are ignorant for thinking you\u2019d never have to act as a step parent. Congrats on wasting everyone\u2019s time.", "YTA. It\u2019s not reasonable to date someone with kids and expect to exclude them from your lives.  Based on your feelings about kids, it sounds like you two aren\u2019t compatible.", "YTA. You're dating a guy with kids...is it really a suprise that the kids will be around sometimes?", "Just break up. You're going to end up being resentful and angry anytime his kids come around. It's not worth it. Don't waste his time and yours when you don't like kids. This situation will only get worse.", "Do you have to let them over? Absolutely not. But if he\u2019s any kind of man at all, this will end the relationship. The kids come first. Don\u2019t date a man with kids if you don\u2019t want to deal with kids, full stop.", "YTA. Why are you dating him if you don't want kids in your house? He is a package deal, him & the kids. Break up with him so he can find someone who will love him & the kids.", "YTA.. He's right, you have no future with him. I hope he breaks up with you now before his children are aware of what an asshole you are.", "Just so you know, his children will always come first\u2026. Not you. You both live there, it\u2019s his home too\u2026. He has children. If you don\u2019t like that you\u2019re better off ending the relationship. You are sounding like an asshole.", "YTA. You knew he has kids. You want all your own privacy, then have your own place.", "End it. The kids will and should come first. Don't attempt to put yourself between a guy and his kids. End it and send him packing. It will never work out.  \n\nYou're young. You are learning about dating. Let this relationship teach you about dating someone with kids. No matter what the circumstances are, the kids come first. Always!", "Total asshole. You are obviously not committed to the relationship. Just end it.", "YTA, don\u2019t get involved with a man who has children if you\u2019re not interested. No matter if they were in the picture or not to begin with, you were aware he still has children. They don\u2019t just go away hunny.", "Oh my dear. If you don't want to be stepmum, don't date men with kids.", "YTA, why are you dating someone with kids if you don\u2019t want anything to do with kids??? And why have a boyfriend live with you if you\u2019re going to remind him it\u2019s not his house?? \nI hope he moves out & finds someone better, because you ain\u2019t it!!", "YTA-. why are so many people who don't want kids or to be a step parent dating people with kids? Have you thought about what would happen if his ex were to be in an accident or pass away? He might need to start taking them full time and rightly so. If you can't accept them then you shouldn't be with him.", "You can\u2019t have a relationship with someone who has kids ACTIVELY in their lives. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve chosen for yourself. Anybody who has a child and is actively in their life WILL want you to be part of it. Yes, they all say it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d that you don\u2019t want to be a mother but that is literally not possible. What if his children get sick? What if their bio mother dies? You would be part of these children\u2019s lives regardless.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to play \u201cmommy\u201d, dump him and meet a guy who doesn\u2019t have children.", "Definitely YTA. You\u2019re 21 and honestly aren\u2019t ready for a relationship with this type of dynamic. He\u2019s a father first and your boyfriend second. If you can\u2019t handle being number two and having his kids around you need to step out of the situation. It would be best for you and most importantly the children. Please make the right decision and leave before you cause any unnecessary issues between him and his children. They deserve so much better than you\u2019re currently willing to give them.", "You really are the asshole. Absolutely an asshole. The worst kind. Don\u2019t date a man with kids if you\u2019re going to treat the kids like that.", "YTA. Childfree people need to stop dating people with kids istg, it's always the shocked Pikachu face when the parent they're dating wants to actually parent.", "It was originally your home, but as soon as he starting paying half the rent that's his home now. It doesn't matter. YTA because he never asked you to play mommy, he just wanted to bring his own kids into the place that he lives. Perhaps you were compatible before, when the kids weren't in the picture, but guess what - now they are, and if you can't compromise at all about his children - then you are no longer compatible. Walk away.", ">It was originally my home\n\nCorrect. ***Was.*** That was then; this is now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I think I have the right to have a say\n\nAlso correct. You have the right to decide if you can tolerate children and act accordingly whichever decision you make: stay in the relationship or end the relationship.\n\nYTA.", "NTA and I like the way you just confronted the situation. Well done! Seriously though, fuck him off and find someone without kids. If not this situation , something similar was bound to happen because he has children out there!", "Well his baby mama moved the kids out of state before I even met him, so how was I to know they\u2019d be back", "No, he doesn\u2019t. She only let him move him because his children were out of state?", "His kids haven\u2019t been in his life since the youngest was 3 months old \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f that\u2019s wat ppl aren\u2019t understanding, this was not suppose to happen. They have been outta state this whole time it wasn\u2019t about \u201ccompatible\u201d", "I\u2019m as childfree as they come, but it makes me sick how many people date single parents and then get all upset when the parent\u2026 acts like a parent. \n\nI mentioned this in another comment, but when you date a parent, you need to be okay with the possibility of that parent having their kids full time. The ex could die, they could run away, they could check themselves in to a mental hospital - none of us have any idea what tomorrow will bring. And if you are not okay with your partner having their kids full time then you should not be dating a parent", "I don\u2019t want kids. Him and I agreed on that already.  He was as against anymore as I was", "Yeah, YTA not because you don't want children, but also because if you don't want children, don't date and move in with a guy who has children. This is just basic logic. It's a normal expectation that somebody who has children will have those children come and stay with them sometimes, even if they don't have primary custody. \n\nWhile I normally would say this communication of expectations was on both parties, the idea that somebody's children will occasionally spend the night at their house is so basic that I'm putting all the blame on her for not expressing this boundary before he moved in - honestly, she should have put this boundary in place before they ever got serious. This couple is just seriously incompatible, and honestly, OP's a bit of an idiot for thinking this issue would never exist.", ">asked how I expected to have a future with him if his kids couldn\u2019t come to our home. I reminded him it wasn\u2019t his home, it was mine first and that it was my decision. \n\nI love how she completely dodged the question too.", "And just don\u2019t expose the children to her hating.", "But still best that their tender hearts not be exposed to OP.", "I\u2019m so sorry you had that painful experience. It\u2019s so true, and is the reason why I keep saying \u201ckeep the kids away from OP.\u201d", "No, don\u2019t expose the kids to her.", "Being a selfish idiot isn't a mental health issue", "Being childfree is not a mental health issue. \n\nDating someone with kids and moving that person into your house, while still proclaiming that it is only your house is incredibly shortsighted and not the best judgement. I\u2019m also not sure at all how these children have been damaged yet. They have had no interactions with OP and shouldn\u2019t even be aware of this situation. So you\u2019re being a touch dramatic there. Still not sure what mental health issue you\u2019re suggesting here? Childfree does not equal a mental illness.", "Because her opinion is ridiculous, being able to have your kid in your home isn't something you can really compromise on, and it's not like they'll be here full time", "I wouldn\u2019t leave him, I love him I just never thought the kids would be in the picture", "It doesn\u2019t matter if they used to live on another planet!! He is still a father and you should ALWAYS assume a parent is going to want their children to come to their home and spend time with them. Smh. I will never understand how people think they can date parents and not be around kids. Makes no sense.", "No matter where they live, they are his children. Did you think they would just disappear entirely?", "Just break up already. Yta \nEven if they were out of state he still has kids.", "You still KNEW and got involved with a man who has children. What did you think that he was never going to have HIS kids with him at any point in your relationship? While you live with him? \n\n\nETA: YTA", "Woooooow girl! Check yourself \"How was I to know they'd be back\" so you were hoping you and him could play happy families while his kids lived out of state with no dad? Ewww. YTA.", "And now they're in the state, he pays half the rent, so he can bring his children to his home.", "No people are understanding it, so you are happy for him to be a deadbeat dad? please just do the children a favour and break up with him.", "Okay, but his kids aren't going to cease to exist, again, why are you dating someone with kids if you don't like kids?", "They are still his children, always were. And now theyrebin his life, he's legally responsible for them. And he wants to see his children in his home he pays half the rent for.", "It IS about \u201ccompatible\u201d.  You don\u2019t want kids or like kids, and you\u2019re in a relationship with a man who has kids.", "So? They\u2019re his kids. Living in another state doesn\u2019t mean they magically don\u2019t exist.", "Things change, and he wants to be in their lives now - what\u2019s your plan?", "People are understanding the situation. The problem is you clearly arent", "Did you think the kids would never ever visit their dad? That's completely unreasonable. I know you're young, but this is a serious incompatibility - if you can't have his children sleep over ever, you guys cannot live together.", "What if their mom died or something? Once you have kids they're always your kids and you're responsible for them (barring termination of parental rights for various reasons). Shit happens, life plans change, and if you can't handle that don't date someone with children.\n\nHonestly, maybe don't date anyone at all until you grow up a little bit more and learn to look beyond the tip of your nose. The world doesn't revolve around you. You don't seem to have grasped that yet.", "How awful that he now has a chance to be a part of his children\u2019s lives!", "Gross. So you willingly and happily got into a relationship with a dead beat dad and now he wants to stand up and be in his children's lives you're punishing him for it? This is the risk you take by dating someone with kids. Hell even dating someone with younger siblings or friends with kids because you never know what can happen.", "What you aren't understanding, though, is that he is still a father, even if he is a bad one who never sees his kids.\n\nYou guys might not have thought about it before, but the reality is that if something happened to the mother, those kids could be coming to live with him permanently.\n\nThis is not something that is going to go away. Decide what you want to do with that information, but don't expect him to choose you over his kids.", "\u201cThis was not supposed to happen.\u201d Well, welcome to life. Now get out of his life before his kids are exposed to your child-hating ways.", "Just because the mom has primary custody and move them out of state, which made visitations for your boyfriend either considerably difficult or not possible, didn't mean they weren't going to come visit him at some point. It also didn't mean that the mom was keeping the kids from him. It literally means that the distance was just unfeasible, and therefore, visitations were put on hold, there was always a chance they would move back considering that's where the children's mother and therefore the children are from since that's where their dad is also from. You apparently don't know the circumstances in which the mother and the children  moved to begin with, nor do you know the circumstances as to why they moved back. The only circumstances you know is that he was not in their life *because of the distance*, now that distance is no longer an issue he is *reinstating* himself into their lives **since he was in their lives previously before they moved**. That should have definitely been a news flash to you that he was never going to just cut his children out of his life. JF \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f people get it alright, and can obviously read between the lines of he was involved with his kids *before* they moved, and now that they have moved back *he wants to be involved again*. He probably never wanted to not be innolved, but knew because of the distance, it wasn't feasible.", "So you just automatically assumed he wouldn't see his kids, you're delusional", "We understand it. You don\u2019t.", "Yeah, this about compatibility. You aren't compatible, do him a favour and break up with him.", "Thank you for bringing this up. I have read posts where this has happened and it is always a possibility that a noncustodial parent needs to step up and become a full time parent. Don\u2019t date someone with children if you are not prepared for that possibility.", "I really doubt that he was against being a parent to his own children, and if he was then he\u2019s not a worthwhile person. You moved him in knowing he had children, now you\u2019re refusing to let him be a parent? YTA", "This isn't about \"more\" kids, this is about his own children that he already has that you were fully aware of. Those children already existed before you started dating him, and you should have known that he would sometimes have to be a father to them.\n\nBy \"Him and I agreed on that already\" did you say to him that when you guys live together he would never ever be allowed to have his children stay the night at his house? Because if he agreed to that, I guess you're not TA, but he is a bad dad. If he didn't explicitly agree to never having his children stay the night at his house, YTA.", "Ma'am, did you miss the part where **he already had kids prior to your relationship**?? Or are you just being obtuse on purpose? He may not want *more* kids but he literally already had kids before you and is therefore still responsible for those kids if the agreement changes because the kids move back closer to him.\n\nEdit: because I forgot, absolutely YTA. *You* don't want kids **don't date people that already have kids**", "well clearly things change for him. \n\nif you don't want kids in your life, you should date a man without kids who's been snipped. his ship has sailed.", "Yes anymore for he already had some.", "Except he had kids already in existence. Too late. What did you expect? A magical no return shield? He isn't somehow NOT their father due to an agreement with his partner at the moment.", "Yeah are you sure he didn't just mean he didn't want kids WITH you when most people that already have kids say that they mean they don't want ANYMORE kids YTA big time and it definitely adds up that he didn't want kids with your childish self", "Not wanting *any* children is a completely different thing than not wanting *any more* children. Clearly you two were not on the same page. YTA for refusing to let him, a dad, parent his kids in HIS home, yes it is his home too since he lives there.", "He doesn't want ANY MORE. Doesn't mean he doesn't want the ones he has.", "Well they\u2019re going to be in the picture *now* and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, and the kids are still young so there\u2019s years of raising and co-parenting to do. \n\nWhat\u2019s your plan now?", "I mean this in the nicest way possible: why the hell would you think that? He\u2019s a father. And when you date a parent, you need to be prepared for any sort of possibility where the kids could end up full time in his care. We have no idea what\u2019s going to happen in life, his ex could be hit by a car tomorrow and die - guess what, he\u2019s now a full time dad. And if that\u2019s not a reality that you\u2019re comfortable with then you should not be dating him. \n\nDating a parent and hoping/expecting them to not spend time with their children is selfish and cruel.", "Well you were wrong.", "He has 2 children. How could you think kids wouldn\u2019t be in your life? Unless you\u2019re a gigantic AH and were hoping your bf would abandon his kids\u2026", "If he has kids that he\u2019s responsible for, and he\u2019s not a deadbeat, then they\u2019re going to be in the picture in some way. You need to accept that if you want to stay with him.", "She\u2019s dating a guy with kids who pays half the rent. What do you expect? If his kids aren\u2019t allowed there and he has to go spend the night somewhere else with them, why is he paying half the rent?", "Seriously? How did you ever think that?", "You are an absolute moron. They are his kids, of course he's going to see them. You can go on and on about how much you love him, but he's going to break up with you over this.", "Like the two options here are that he's a deadbeat dad, and therefore a pretty shitty person, or he's a dad and sometimes those children will be in her house. Why would she want to be in a relationship for either option?", "I\u2019ve seen a few posts from women who claim they want to be child free but date men with kids who are ACTIVELY in their lives. It\u2019s literally scrapping the barrel. Just DATE a man without ANY kids!", "Nope.   That wasn\u2019t the agreement.", "Agreed, he said he didn\u2019t want any *more* children, which makes a huge difference.", "Idk that\u2019s up to him\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Idk wat he\u2019s tryna do but I been here for him, gave him a place to stay when he had no one, not his baby mama or his kids", "They made a written rental agreement that his children can never cone to the home he pays rent for? Highly doubt it.", "And now he's paying half the rent,so the place is equally his.", "He\u2019s paying equal now, so he owes you nothing. Also, relationships aren\u2019t supposed to be tit for tat. \n\nAgain, what\u2019s your plan now?

End of the day, he pays half the rent, he can bring his kids to his home.", "She said he lives with her, not that they live together. Doubtful that his name is on the lease.\n\nWhen they got together, the kids were not part of the deal. He is suddenly changing the situation. She\u2019s not obligated to accommodate that.", "True, she\u2019s not obligated to accomodate that, but if she decides not to she\u2019s exposed a significant incompatibility that they\u2019re not going to be able to address.
