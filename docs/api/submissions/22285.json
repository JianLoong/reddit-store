The only problem is, my parents have a really strict rule that they're not allowed to hang out without one of them [or myself] present. Given there was recently a pregnancy scare [that my parents don't know about], I think this is a perfectly reasonable rule. Sorry, but I don't feel like being an uncle, I don't think my sister is going to want to be a mother right now, and she's already confided in me that they don't use protection regularly at all [she told me after the scare that they wouldn't be doing anything unprotected for 2 weeks minimum. I called her stupid.].\n\nNow, since my parents have that rule, and they tend to go to sleep around 9:30, I have to be the one to sit up in the living room with them to make sure they don't do anything. They tend to stay up until way after midnight, which isn't the problem, as I have intense insomnia and don't end up sleeping until 6:00 or 6:30 anyway.\n\nThe problem is every night for a week now, I've had to sit here for hours listening to them make out. I hate the sounds of spit and they're not even trying to hide it. I try not to look at them, in case I see hands in places I don't want to.\n\nFrankly, I'm sick of it. I don't want to be their babysitter to make sure they don't end up fucking on the couch. Why is it my responsibility? But if I don't, my sister will come down to our shared room and be all pissy with me, yell at me, and just generally be a bitch to me. It's not like they don't have all day to see each other, they spend All Day in his bedroom [door open, in plain sight] cuddled up and kissing and whatever else. We're only here for a few more days, is a little bit of abstinence until we get back home and she can go over to his place too much to ask?\n\nI may be the asshole because I understand with their work, they don't get to see each other very often [once or twice a week] and this is their chance. I'm also aroace, and so romance and sex and all of that just really isn't my cup of tea, thus probably making me a bit biased. I may be an asshole because I don't understand regular sex drive, and maybe this is something that's necessary? I don't know.\n\nI don't care what they do, I just don't like that they do it in front of me. And, if I decide to just leave and my parents find out, we're all in trouble.\n\nPoint being, should I just stick it out for their sake? Or would I be an asshole not watching them?\n\nEdit: I should mention. They do this in front of me because they deemed me \"Not Snitching Age\" which, hey, I'm no snitch. I just don't wanna see it.", "created_utc": 1689397302, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1502jzk/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_my_sisters_babysitter/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who's bright idea was it to bring a teen's boyfriend along on a family vacation thinking they wouldn't be actively trying to find an opportunity to get pregnant?", "NTA, that's annoying as shit. Making out when you're not alone (barring something like a nightclub) is disrespectful as fuck. if I were you i'd just buy a pack of condoms, throw it at your sister and then leave lmao.", "NTA. And your sister and BF are idiots. She is going to end up pregnant.", "NTA. Dude, I'm old enough to be your dad. Idk what rock your parents live under where they can pull the same oblivious shit that I'd expect out of Boomer aged parents. I'm 37....I remember what I was like then. I know how little things have changed in terms of teenage hormones and doing stupid shit your parents won't find out or know about. How they're this dense is beyond me, especially in today's age, there's zero excuse for it.", "NTA - your parent's rule is unfairly impacting you and your vacation.\n\nCan you tap one of your parents in for a few nights? Explain how late they stay up, and that you'd like to go to bed earlier for a change. (Or you could fake feeling ill and retire to your room early.)", "Listen here big bro,i don't think that bf of hers is gonna take responsibility if she fell pregnant, and i know it's not your problem but you don't want your sister failing in life cuz of him, so i advise you to be annoying (a snitch), like tell them when you're babysitting them, i don't like what your doing so if you don't stop I'll snitch on ya (and actually do it if they continue).\n\nI know you will be annoying,but you have to save your sister.\n\nThe choice is up to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's a committed relationship, this isn't a \"heat of the moment\" thing.", "THANK YOU\n\nI TRIED TELLING HER THAT BUT SHE DON'T GIVE A DAMN", "NTA. You are a child and this is not your responsibility. Your sister is being disgusting by having \"make out sessions\" with her boyfriend while you're in the room. You should tell your parents everything and have them have a talk with her. She clearly isn't mature enough to be dealing with this situation alone. When I was 17, I was on the pill and took Morning After if I was even the *slightest* but concerned about having taken it my regular pill late or anything. She isn't being responsible AT ALL. She clearly needs more sex education and to have it explained to her that *she* will be responsible for her baby, not your parents. Maybe that will make her realise she's being an idiot.", "NTA. Excuse yourself to bed before your parents so you can have some time to yourself", "Ffs, get that girl on some contraception. It\u2019s just a matter of time before she\u2019s pregnant.

Some people are determined to ruin their own lives. She's so crazed with horniness that she's not even grossed out by the very idea of making out with someone in front of her own brother, what makes you think she isn't going to just go get knocked up the second she's out of his sight? He can't be everywhere.", "I mean, while possibly true, they\u2019re also 17.
