My sister (25F) is getting married soon, and the entire family is ecstatic, but I am not. Her fianc\u00e9 (30M) stole a business idea from me a few years back, and I'm seriously considering skipping the wedding because of it.\n\nBackstory: I'd been working on a unique business concept for  a few years, and I told my sister about it. I thought we were close. Fast forward a bit, and lo and behold, her fianc\u00e9 launches the same damn business, basically stealing my idea and profiting off it. This scheme is what is funding most of their wedding, FYI. \n\nI confronted them about it, and they played dumb, acting like it was \"just a coincidence\", and they \"had no idea\". I was furious, hurt, and betrayed, but for the sake of the family, I decided not to press the issue any further.\n\nNow the wedding is approaching, and my parents are pressuring me to attend after I mentioned to them that I want to skip it. They argue that family comes first, and I should set aside my grievances for the sake of my sister's big day. On the other hand, I feel like attending would be a slap in the face, as I feel it would signal that what they did is forgivable and that I'm okay with being walked all over.\n\nSo AITA for wanting to skip my sister's wedding over this? Should I put aside my feelings and be there for her, or is it fair for me to take a stand against what feels like a major betrayal? I'm torn.\n\nEdit for Info: A few of you really wanted to know what the business idea was. I can't go into detail as it is pretty niche and would be easy to look up and find out a bit too much personal info on my BIL. I can tell you though that is was an app idea, it is identical to the idea I was working on. \n\nAlso, some people are defending BIL by saying that I \"wasn't going to go through with it\", I had been taking part-time entrepreneurship classes at a local college and was teaching myself how to build an app at the time. I told my sister about it and showed her what I was working on. He stole the idea before I had the chance to go through with it and sold it to his buds, now he co-owns it. \n\nI think it's also important to note that I dabble in photography, and from conversations with my parents it sounds like my sister wants me to photograph her wedding for her, but I have not heard anything about intended payment for photographing her wedding. So by not going not only would I be causing a bit of drama, I'd also be leaving them without a photographer according to my mom. (I *never* agreed to photograph, this was apparently \"assumed\" by my sister.)", "created_utc": 1702537866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18i30yj/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 465, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you were deeply hurt by this.

Throw in the assumption you'll photograph the wedding without talking to you first or sorting out payment for it, and I can fully understand why you don't want to attend.\n\nIf you don't go, you won't be depriving your sister of a photographer.

Why not ask to be part of the idea?\n\nAlso, if your sister hasn't got a photographer booked this close to the wedding, its clear to me that they are expecting you to do it. That makes you a vendor, not a guest. Vendors require payment, considering that their stolen idea is what's funding the wedding.

The woman who co-created *Tinder* and was kicked out, went on to create *Bumble*. \n\nPeople who steal ideas, steal because they never have an original thought. And they always hit a wall. Think about how Sam Levinson created the TV show *Euphoria*, but S2 wasn't liked. And then multiple people came forward saying he stole their ideas for S1. S2 was all Sam Levinson and it wasn't good.\n\nYou've got this.

When you have a successful business, everyone under the sun comes to you for coaching or funding or advice or partnership with their.  Relatives, friends, old colleagues, old customers, neighbours, random people everywhere. The amount of people who have ideas but never do anything with them is mind boggling.  Very few actually get moving and the few that do, it fails even if the idea was good.   The story is always the same:  \u201cI\u2019m going to incorporate soon\u201d or \u201cyes I just paid my registration fees and I launch when I get the funding\u201d or \u201clook at my under construction website\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s going to be awesome but I\u2019m paying so local college program to learn about online marketing first \u201c kind of thing.", "NTA\n\nBut I want to mention that I once told an old family friend about a niche-y business idea I'd had for a while.\n\nA couple years later he comes by to tell me of this really cool thing he did -- exactly my idea.

Your feelings are valid either way, because they stole your idea.\n\nIt all depends on the specifics, their reaction when confronted, and what they're like in other areas.

(I never agreed to photograph, this was apparently \"assumed\" by my sister.)\n\nThe fact that your sister simply expected you to provide, for free, a service that ordinarily costs thousands of dollars **and did not even ask you about it** tells me that your sister does not really respect you.  Your mother's acquiescence speaks to some pretty poor treatment from your family.

I think you need to decide do you want a relationship with your sister or not. If you do then you might have to let it go. It\u2019s shitty but that\u2019s life sometimes. Side note. A good idea doesn\u2019t always mean a successful business. There\u2019s no guarantee you would have made money.

It was already a work in progress.\n\nI get the feeling of betrayal, you showed your sister what you had so far at that time because you wanted to share your joy for what you achieved on your own with your project, and she took that to her fianc\u00e9, and now they're profiting off of it. \n\nSet aside your emotions for a bit and think what would be best for you long term.

I mean, there will be drama because she expects you to be the photographer, and if you decline, you might not attend it anyway.

It is important to note that just because you have a right to be angry and hurt, and your planned response to that hurt doesn\u2019t warrant a YTA vote from me or the general public, the opinions of strangers on a Reddit thread are not going to matter to your sister or parents. \n\nSkipping a sibling\u2019s wedding usually means at a minimum a strained relationship with that sibling for an extended period of time, and that stain could be forever. It will also likely cause some issues with other members of your family in the short term. If you in general had a toxic relationship with your family i would say who cares, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here. You mentioned no continued issues with either your sister or parents. You even stated that until the crap you FBIL pulled you and sis had a close relationship. \n\nSo what you have to ask yourself is if skipping the wedding to show your displeasure with your future BIL is worth possibly losing out on a relationship with your sister, or any future nieces or nephews.
