Last year she finally got engaged after 10 years of dating\n\nMy sister (30F) and I were invited to go with my cousin to pick out wedding dresses. She said it was important that we were there. It was also the weekend of her bachelorette. My sister and I live in a different state so we booked tickets and had a great time. While talking about the wedding, we asked my cousin for the date as we wanted to get plane tickets early. She gave us the date and said, \"see you soon\u201d\n\nMonths later my aunt (55F) told my dad (61M) (her brother) that my family and I were not invited to the wedding as they had run out of capacity for the venue\n\nI had come to visit my parents that morning as we go on weekend hikes. I heard the whole thing. My dad and mom were pretty upset. They had booked tickets and were told prior that they should be expecting an invite. We were very disappointed but we originally understood that it was going to be a small wedding and maybe it was smaller than we realized.\n\nMy mom, though, had been through wedding drama before she asked. \"how much is capacity?\u201d My aunt said, \u201coh they are having 130 people.\u201d We were in shock.\n\nThat\u2019s when my dad asked, \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t we be in the top 130?\u201d My aunt, ever the honest one, said my cousin \u201cdoesn\u2019t really know us.\u201d\n\nLike we didn't just go pick out wedding dresses and help pay for a bachelorette! My family has gone back and forth from their home since we were kids, which was never reciprocated. We've sent birthday gifts to her, etc\n\nMy dad ended the call with a simple \"congratulations.\" I could see how hurt he was. My dad puts a lot of effort into keeping his family together as he is the oldest child, both parents are gone, and he moved away when he and my mom got married. I could tell that this was a slap in the face. His family doesn\u2019t reciprocate. As a comparison, they were even invited to my older sister's wedding too. They didn't come\n\nFast forward, my parents refuse to answer my aunt\u2019s calls. My aunt calls me instead. She says she has convinced my cousin to allow us at the wedding. I told her, \u201cThanks but no thanks. We won't be coming to the wedding.\"\n\nMy aunt told me I was an ass. She worked hard to get us into the wedding. She tattle-told my parents what I had said. But my parents assured me that they would have declined the invite too as they believe it would be awkward to attend now\n\nDays later, another call, it was my cousin telling me that my aunt was crying. She said I should apologize and be grateful that I was now invited. She had to disinvite others. I snapped saying that it was her fault for not inviting us and putting our families in this situation\n\nMy parents have gone no contact with my aunt for now. I've thought about apologizing but I also want them to feel bad too.

Your cousin wasn't obligated to invite you, although it's weird that she went dress shopping and planned a bachelorette before sending out wedding invitations or even deciding on the guest list. It sounds like she was honest about the capacity issues given that she had to disinvite people to make room for you.\n\nHowever, you're not obligated to accept an invitation.
