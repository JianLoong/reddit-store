Why does your mom think it's malicious to want to keep your stuff safe?", "NTA - There's nothing wrong with not wanting your stuff broken!", "NTA.  It is your room, and your things.  You should not be obligated to allow people with a history of carelessness access to your room/items.  Sounds like anyone calling you selfish is being a manipulative jerk.", "Nta. Your mom is manipulative.", "NTA - unless your mom is going to replace anything they break (or better yet, make the parents do it).", "NTA.  My mother used to do this to me.  I\u2019m really old now, and it still pisses me off just thinking about it, and she can\u2019t believe it still bothers me.  You have the right to protect your space and belongings, OP.  But if your mother is going to be an AH about it - fine.  Spend some time and pack everything you don\u2019t want broken up into boxes (probably your entire room) and store them somewhere safe until the Horde of Children leave.", "NTA get yourself a temporary door lock one that just slip onto the door.  Use it for the party so they cannot get in.", "NTA. Your mom sounds intrusive and maybe a bit controlling, and you\u2019ve been really tolerant of that. But as the mom of a toddler, they wreck stuff and that shouldn\u2019t be your problem.", "I will say NTA, you have a right to privacy and your personal space being off limits, but as someone who grew up with lots of younger cousins, I know how these parties sometimes go if you leave young children unsupervised.  Is it possible you could take everything that you don't want damaged and move it someplace else, maybe a closet or space that locks?", "NTA but I\u2019m a little confused as to why the kids would be in your room in the first place?", "nta", "Nta  your request is very reasonable. There's no reason why babies or anyone needs to be in your room. How would your mom like it if those babies went to play in her room instead. I'm sure she wouldn't like it. Maybe you should lock your room and keep the key in you. Or maybe change venues to where you go out to celebrate at a restaurant instead of your house. At least this way your stuff is safe.", "Box up all your valuable art stuff and store it somewhere safe, preferably at a friend's house.\n\nNTA", "When you say babies, I\u2019m going to infants, still in car seats and am like \u201cY T A\u2026 what are they going to do? Cry?\u201d \n\nBut as you explain it, it sounds more like your talking about toddlers and young kids (heck maybe even older kids), and to this NTA. Younger kids have a tendency to get into things they shouldn\u2019t if not watched, and being a party my guess is they will have free reign to run around, least that\u2019s how family parties where for me growing up. Even if you get your mom to agree, I would clean up your room by putting the delicate and expensive stuff away and out of reach, cause chances are any agreement won\u2019t be enforced and kids will still randomly walk in and do what they want.", "I can think of several reasons your mom is calling you selfish (all of which make your mom an asshole):\n\n1) She had planned on letting the babies and other kids use your supplies as entertainment for them.\n\n2) She thinks you are too old (too old = there exists at least one kid in the family who is younger than you, even if it's by days) for art and dolls and toys. So you shouldn't complain when they're taken away. Sentimentality be damned.\n\n3) She thinks you're spending too much money on art supplies and dolls and toys, so is discouraging you from wanting to own any by taking them away and destroying them.\n\n4) And she likely also thinks you should be using what money you have to get stuff for the rest of the family (or at least for the favorite members of the family) instead of what she sees as useless stuff for yourself.\n\n5) Lending out ->>> Gifting (don't expect it back, ever)\n\n6) She wants the rest of the family and/or others outside the family to see her as very generous and welcoming. It doesn't matter if her immediate family members suffer in maintaining this illusion.\n\n... I think that covers the most likely. NTA and I hope you can find a way to save your belongings.", "NTA. But you can't control parents. Try putting as much as you can in your closet and block it shut if there is no way to lock your room. Not wanting stuff broken has nothing to do with being spoiled.", "NTA. You deserve to have some privacy and for your things not to be broken. If your father is around, ask him to put a locking door knob on your door before the party. If not, move absolutely everything a kid would want to touch out of the room. Your mom is being nice by throwing the party, I guess, but it sounds like it's for her, not you.", "NTA- I hate that people think it's wrong to be angry if a kid ruins your stuff/event. It's bad parenting to allow your kids to run wild and get into things that don't belong to them, or for there not to be consequences if they break things even if that's by being careless rather than malicious. They need to learn to be considerate and you teach them that by telling them when they screwed up. 'You're not allowed in there because you broke her things last time.' is the mildest possible consequence available and fully appropriate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
