I asked my mom for a ring from my father\u2019s side that is a chiseled family crest of a rare stone set in a gold.  She always hated this ring, said it was ugly and chipped. It dates back to the 1600s. I thought she would have no care for it since she hates my dad and it is MY family. She said no. I will not receive anything, with no explanation. My sister and I figure that it\u2019s because our mom doesn\u2019t want to part with any of the collection because she loves fine jewelry.  Mind you, my grandmother  did give it to my mother but she wants nothing to with that family, lives in an unlocked small house in the middle of nowhere with a known history of break ins and kept everything from my fathers side during the divorce.

Spite is the only reason I can think of for her action.", "In this case the items were not hers because of marriage or even gifts from the husband. They were gifts from her mother in law. Even if there were a prenup, they wouldn't be covered by it. The father's family made choices that brought it to this place. Unfortunate for the OP, but I can't blame the mother if she is selling them, because it doesn't sound like she came out of what is described as a toxic marriage with much. OP is YTA for blaming her mother for this, but I'm also guessing more hurt is about feeling rejected/ abandoned than it is about the jewelry.", "How did they come in your family? \n\nStolen and plundered by your ancestors, right? How many people have suffered so your ancestors can get some rings and stones?", "I feel like since she didn't like that particular piece, she probably did sell it and panicked when it was the one you asked for.", "Op doesn\u2019t trust her mom and her mom kind of wants to be less and less part of her daughter\u2019s life while apparently starting to be part of a new family. Op feels left out, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s greedy. I think she wants her mom to acknowledge her. Also it\u2019s not unusual to pass something down in a special occasion, it doesn\u2019t have to happen when someone dies. That\u2019s just dark. The things given to you by a loved one when they live are more important than those you receive when someone you care about dies.", "This sounds pretty bad, on the husband\u2019s part. I\u2019m wondering if she needs to get away from him, in which case the jewelry might be her only source of ready cash.", "Op says she is disgusted by her father but also by her mother because she feels like she puts men in front of her daughters. Which could be a true claim, considering she only visited two times after her daughter\u2019s child was born and is apparently working really hard in creating a relationship with her new stepchildren.", "This. I see a lot of comments completely ignoring the \u201cmy mother has seen me only two times after giving birth five months ago and is focusing on creating a good relationship with her husbands children\u201d part.", "Apparently, she doesn\u2019t talk with him anymore", "Yes.", "Oh. I was going to suggest OP should sneak in and steal them", "Yeah, I was waiting for this comment.", "Do you/your dad have any money?  Just trade her/buy them. She wants assets. She doesn\u2019t care what they are. Get the shit that matters to you. You shouldn\u2019t *have* to, but it\u2019s the only way to ensure it isn\u2019t stolen, sold, \u201clost,\u201d or given to the steps. And the reason she\u2019s being so obstinate right now may be because that particular items is missing, so be prepared for that outcome as well\u2026", "They aren't yours, so you should have no worries.\n\nShe should sell them. Generational wealth is disgusting.", "OP said she doesn\u2019t visit her mom but her mom visited her twice in the last 5 months. I don\u2019t agree it\u2019s dark at all to say OP will get this jewelry when she dies, that\u2019s just the truth. I also don\u2019t agree gifts given when alive are more important but even if that\u2019s true, her mom isn\u2019t obligated to have OP go through her collection and pick and choose pieces for herself.", "I think a part of it is that my sister and mom always felt like our father treated me better. I don\u2019t feel that way at all. In fact, I had to clean up his messes. My sister has no patience and my mom couldn\u2019t deal with it. Also, my mom was not married yet when my sister married and her spending was separate from her now husband. He would never allow her to spend that kind of money on jewelry now that their money is conjoined. So maybe she\u2019s holding in tight to everything?", "OP def NTA. But the baubles were fleeced or deprived from most families long ago\u2014Legacy is a little less material to ppl like us", "He\u2019s not very healthy. It could be security just incase something happens to him . It\u2019s already so messy. He has six adult kids and she has us two.  My mom has put half of everything into this small house which is in his name, when they pass.. it\u2019s going to be a nightmare. I hate even thinking about it but there isn\u2019t any real thought or logic with their actions. He\u2019s a nice man but man.. it\u2019s not good.  She works full time and on weekends, cooks and cleans and goes to the laundry mat to go all the laundry because he doesn\u2019t want to buy a machine. He is retired. It\u2019s part of the reason why I never see her.  The house is a mess, no heat, open wall sockets, no working toilet. I don\u2019t understand her honestly.\n\nI cried a couple days ago. I had my daughters baptism and they came. About 20 people were here and she showed up with garbages of clothes to wash since they were here for the weekend. She defends him and her actions. You can\u2019t give her any thoughts on what you notice.  She gets mean and will deflect", "Dad is also an ahole. Op says she finds him disgusting and doesn\u2019t talk with him anymore.", "When you are talking about cutting contact, you are taking in consideration the moral part, not the legal one. She did not ask \u201dAita for deciding to go to court with my mom over a heirloom\u201d", "The mom is not poor. Her new husband his rich, just doesn\u2019t let her do everything with his money", "Its probably not a true story.", "Yeah for sure, like 90% of the shit on here probably isn't true. I just prefer to suspend disbelief for these drama type subreddits.", "Lol wut?  There's nothing whatsoever in the law stipulating any such thing.  For a start, the family would have to prove that they were previously in possession of the items and for how long?  What length of time or other characteristics would qualify an item as an 'heirloom'?\n\nThe mother was given the items, therefore they're hers to do with what she wishes.", "Could you buy them from her to make sure you get them back ?", "Had the father died and she was a widow, I would agree. Bit she divorced him and his family. That means as heirloom pieces they are no longer her, because she is no longer part of that family", "Op, I suggest you add this to your post. It helps to understand more your background and overall relationship with your mom. Maybe people will actually analyze the situation instead of stopping at you being greedy", "You\u2019re right. I\u2019m horrible at explaining  my situation because there is so much to unpack and at first glance, it seems like I\u2019m an entitled asshole."]}
