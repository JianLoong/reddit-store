When I asked her if I could have some of his military belongings (that he gave me years prior but she was holding onto because we moved) she'd repeatedly shut me down. Turns out she threw it all away. Heartbreaking.", "NAH. They were given to her and she gets to keep them.if she wants. She will be an AH if she does not will them to you and your sister. \n\nAsk if you can borrow a piece or two for the wedding. I wanted my Grandma's wedding band. My mom did not decide to give it to me. I was allowed to borrow it and I tied it to my bouquet the day of to have her with me. I gave it back before we left the reception. \n\nThis was a solution that worked for everyone involved. Both of my sisters have also borrowed pieces from my mom for special occasions.", "She probably doesn't have the pieces anymore", "She sold it and dosen't want to tell you", "These people in the comments clearly don\u2019t understand how family heirloom jewelry works.  There definitely should have been a pre or post nup regarding the jewelry or a judgment in the divorce making sure it would go to the daughters.", "NTA is there a way to take her to court for this?", "~~After reading your post and the replies I'm going with E S H~~\n\nI do not think you're being fully truthful as to having no idea why she would say no.  \n\n\nedited - YTA", "YTA because you want to end a relationship with your mom because she won't give you jewelry you want.  Maybe my perspective is colored by the fact that my father just died, but I think relatioships with family are infintely more valuable that any material object.  I certainly understand that you might feel upset.  Feeling upset sounds reasonable.  But to end your relationship with your mom because she didn't give you a ring you want is petty and sad.", "YTA. Your mom said she intends to pass the jewelry down, she is under no obligation to do so until she passes. They were given as a gift and she is allowed to enjoy them while she\u2019s living, especially considering your dad had an affair and it\u2019s his fault the marriage ended. You are very selfish to insist and request specific pieces from her jewelry collection before she\u2019s ready to give them away. You also are TA for implying you can\u2019t trust her husband or his family seemingly just because they\u2019re poor and humble.", "NTA.  But your dad really should have stipulated that all be returned to him during the divorce.", "NTA.\n\nIs there any way you can get a copy made and swap them out without her noticing?", "NTA, but are you sure she still has the ring?", "Nta", "I wouldn't be surprised if all of the pieces were gone. I don't think there's anything left for op to receive.", "NTA  \n**Actually, you father could have a legal claim to the jewelry because he could say he gave it to her to keep but not to own. It should go back to him after the divorce.**\n\n**You should consult a lawyer, more so if you don't want to talk to her anyway.**\n\n**I**I know of one case of someone who had a heirloom engagement ring and had to give it back in the divorce.", "NTA.  But why don't you offer to pay her for the jewelry?  I know it seems unfair, but, it's better than losing those pieces.", "NTA Go to your moms house, steal the jewelry", "NTA - I am worried she has already sold it.", "Both of you should play nice until your mom kicks the bucket when she does hopefully she doesnt have a will and yall can fight her step kids on the jewelry in court", "OP, instead of going nuclear immediately, ask your mom if there's another piece of the heirloom jewelry she'd be willing to part with instead. Maybe she likes the ring you're asking for, or something has happened to it and she doesn't want to admit it to you.\n\nIf worst comes to worst, maybe plan on borrowing your sister's bracelet for the wedding? It'd combine the something old AND something borrowed AND something blue lol", "NTA\n\nHowever I'd be willing to bet that if they're living as \"Humble\" as you say that the reason you're not getting it is because she no longer has it. My guess is it was sold.", "Your obsession with some jewelry certainly reveals that you are your mother\u2019s daughter. There\u2019s a lot of veiled classism in your rant that I just can\u2019t get over, sounds like your grew up with some pretty nice things and look down on your mothers new family. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your attitude has shown through in real life and that\u2019s part of why your mother does not want to acquiesce.\n\nIt\u2019s very strange how you, a grown ass woman presumably living on your own expects the same amount of attention as your mom\u2019s husband and step children, who she spends every day with. You present it as long term neglect when she remarried a year ago when you were 34. She visited twice in the passed five months, that\u2019s pretty normal.\n\nI\u2019m going with unreliable narrator, YTA. OP sounds like a real peach in these comments, and if that\u2019s a reflection of her IRL then I\u2019m not surprised she is having conflicts.", "NTA \n\nBut I wouldn't be surprised if she has sold the items. Something similar happened in my family. The person had requested them and had children (who have now had children), so it would have looked to everyone like they would pass on these antiques down to the next generation. Everyone in the family is now pretty sure they sold almost everything. Passed down through 4/5 generations before them, and they sold them.", "Yta I'm not a fan of kids demanding their parents stuff.  \n\nIf it wasn't negotiated in either a pre nup or the divorce, its now *her* jewelry.   \n\nAsk your grandma for a piece.", "NTA. She\u2019s probably sold it. But you may want to consider offering to purchase the heirloom collection from your mother just in case she hasn\u2019t yet.", "rob her like set it up fr", "What do you want to bet they've been selling some of the collection?", "I've never understood why  people who marry into families that have heirlooms think they are entitled to keep them in the event of a divorce.\n\nIn any case, the mom wants nothing to do with the dad, so the heirloom jewelry should have either been returned to the family, or given to the children they share without them having to ask. The only reasons the mom would have kept the jewels and doesn't want to pass them on to the rightful heirs/owners is either to pass them down to her new step-children, sold them, or they were stolen.", "Or gave them to her new step-children. I hope that's not the case but some people are just assholes and want to impress/get kudos from \"the new kids\".", "My first thought. She definitely sold them.", "Except it doesn\u2019t say that was an expectation in the post. Her mom is also still alive so has plenty of time to pass them down or OP will get them when her mom passes. OP sounds very greedy and it\u2019s unclear why she doesn\u2019t trust the new husband outside of him being poor.", "I wonder who would she being cutting of, since her mother basically forgot about her daughter. It's sad but OP should let it be. A piece of jewellery might have sentimental value but she can still tell her daughter how amazing the women who owned the jewelry were. It's nice to have something physical but even if the rings vanished, the fact her family had one of the first female graduates from an ivy League school and apparently also one of the first important woman of business (hundreds of years ago) still happened. I think the only valuable thing we have about my great grandmother is a fur coat that one of my aunts kept as a treasure but everyone else still teaches the new generation about her and my grandma. We don't need jewelry to keep their legacy alive.", "She\u2019s a thief for keeping jewelry she was given? She can still pass them down when she dies.", "> Even if it\u2019s a family heirloom, you are not entitled to it. \n\nI am always complaining about how people here are way too entitled. With that being said, I would argue that a family heirloom, especially one from her dad's side of the family, is something that she would be entitled to.", "Technically hers but very clearly given with the intent they would be passed down\n\nThis is a case of legally clear, but morally suspect\n\nI think there's not enough info because if she's willed them to the daughter's, it's morally fine- she's still alive, it's hers. However, if they have been sold or are given to anyone else then we're getting into A H territory\n\nIn full honesty, however, they should have been returned to Dad's family in the divorce, and that's on Dad for not making sure of that", " I truly believe it\u2019s because she loves Jewelry. I don\u2019t see any other reason as to why she would say no.", "No no, there is much more to it. That\u2019s the straw the broke the camel\u2019s back.  And it\u2019s not about the value to me, it is to her. It\u2019s the specialness of those items. I\u2019m", "Idk. It\u2019s more than a ring. It\u2019s  the secrecy. Who knows", "Yeah that's been my thought. It may not be solid yet but it's been appraised and will likely get shipped out.", "Was my exact thought as well.", "I too spend a lot of time on Reddit, I agree with you.", "You might as well just get comfortable with that possibility, or your mother giving them to the step siblings. Sorry, it sucks.", "Assuming because OPs mom has \"moved on\" from having a relationship with her daughters in lieu of her new step kids.  \n\nWho shouldn't be given these heirlooms.", "she doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re right, I think I\u2019m just scared because my mother is so trusting.  I don\u2019t trust these items in her hands right now", "they were intended to be passed down during special occasions while she was alive.", "Morally, maybe so - but not legally, which is the issue when you\u2019re talking about ownership and wills.", ">It\u2019s not hers. She was supposed to pass those items to her daughters. She is a thief.\n\nThe jewelry was given to Mom: it's hers.  \nIt's not hers to sell or to give away EXCEPT to her ex-husband if he claimed it back, or to daughters who are due to inherit it, but Mom isn't a \"thief\" for saying \"this jewelry is mine by gift and I don't have to give it to anyone until I'm dead.\"", "You and your sister get to receive it when your mom dies.  \n\n\nYou do not get to demand it ahead of the day your mom dies and the ancestral jewelry, gifted to her, descends to you and your sister.  \n\n\nLook, advice isn't what this sub is for. *But if it was me*, I'd ask my mom \"Is it because you specifically don't want to see me wearing that ring? if so, can we decide together which one of these items of jewelry you are OK with seeing me wear at my wedding and in my married life?\"", "I don\u2019t understand this type of dynamic between a mother and her children. I\u2019d do anything for my kids and they\u2019re young adults. My husband and I were recently talking about replacing my diamonds with moissanite\u2019s and splitting them between my 3 kids. Why wait until I die. I\u2019m going to get a few strands of pearls restrung for nephews wife to be and my nieces. None of these items I have are overly valuable, they\u2019re just things I want my young family to have and enjoy. Best wishes for you and your new family, I know you\u2019ll make better choices in your future.", "Do you see the irony in coveting this jewelry as an inheritance when you say what you admire about the jewelry is that it was purchased by a line of women who earned and bought it for themselves?  \n\nMy guess is your mom already sold the jewelry, which is why she won't give you an answer as to why she won't give you a piece.  You can ask to borrow the ring for the wedding, and see if that changes anything.  If not, she's probably sold it and no longer has it.\n\nAside from that, create your own heirloom jewelry.  Earn it and buy it for yourself, like your ancestors.  Then you can take pride in yourself, rather than in other people's accomplishments.", "I get it but please, your ancestors were more than just jewelry. You don't need stuffs to teach your baby about their legacy. \nI'm sorry about your mother's attitude towards you, your sister and your baby. Let it go, maybe she'll realize someday that she messed up but if she doesn't, you have a brand new family.", "Reading through your comments I already feel like I know why she said no......  \n\n\nYou do not seem like a good person.", "Your dad cheated and now you are mad at your mom for not giving you a ring.  Did I miss anything?  You seem surprisingly unconcerned that your dad cheated on your mom.", "Secrecy about her jewelry is certainly her prerogative, and so is you going LC as a result.  She might be keeping things to herself if she has already sold or given the jewelry away.", "I think you\u2019re right that she needs to resign herself to not receiving anything.
