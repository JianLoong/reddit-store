Same dad, different moms, no I\u2019m not the result of an affair. \n\nEllen and I are not close, and never have been, we only saw each other at family get togethers. Ellen has a husband \u201cTom\u201d (34).

I didn\u2019t hear this from Ellen, but from my dad, and from my husband, who was told by Tom. Tom then started staying really late at work and then progressed to coming over to our house often for drinks with my husband, and by extension, me. He became a regular visitor to our house, and began unloading his problems. \n\nThis went on for about 8 months until one evening Tom was quite tipsy and admitted he\u2019d developed \u201ca crush\u201d on me. Understandably, this meant he didn\u2019t come back to our house (he has profusely apologised for this and we\u2019re fine now, but obviously I just prefer some distance).\n\nI guess that whole thing was a wake up call for him because he and Ellen started going to counselling. During the counselling, he told her about what had happened, because Ellen called me and screamed at me for the whole situation. She said she and Tom would never be in the same room with me again after \u201cwhat I\u2019d done\u201d. She made excuses for not coming to family gatherings I was at for a while before my dad confronted her and she said she and I had fallen out and weren\u2019t speaking. I went along with this because I didn\u2019t want to tell my dad the truth either. It has been over a year of this. \n\nBut this all came to a head over my dad inviting both of us and our families to NYE and getting mad that Ellen wouldn\u2019t come if I was going. He started ranting at me that we needed to grow up and make peace and if we didn\u2019t want to talk to each other fine but not being able to be in the same room was nuts. I got sick of being berated and said I agree but it wasn\u2019t me who started it. My dad then demanded to know what the fight was about and wouldn\u2019t let up. Eventually I just told him.\n\nHe\u2019s furious. He called Ellen and yelled at her, he called my husband and yelled at him. He is seething that no one told him and that he has been acting like things are fine with Tom this whole time. Ellen is furious with me for telling Dad, saying I did this on purpose and have ruined things with Tom after she\u2019d worked so hard to fix them.\n\nI feel bad for the results, but I also feel like carrying the burden of this rift that I didn\u2019t cause was unfair on me in the first place.

He deserves to know why his kids are fighting.", "NTA. Other people\u2019s messes were getting in the way of your relationship with your dad, and you had the right to defend yourself by sharing the reality with him.", "NTA.  Shit happens, your sister sounds like she sucks.", "NTA\n\nIt had been going on for a long time - your dad asked and you told him the truth. You should not be expected to lie to your dad about it.\n\nIt should also go in your favour that you shut down his advanced as soon as it happened.", "NTA for spilling but YTA for allowing him to come over for eight months while your sister was home with a new born baby. Do you know how difficult it is in those first few months? Couple that with post partum and martial issues. None of that is you\u2019re fault but I think you guys enabled him and are now  focusing on the wrong part of this. It\u2019s not really about the crush but more about the fact that you allowed her husband to \u201cescape\u201d and drink in your home without so much of a heads up. She feels betrayed. It feels a little weird that you could show compassion to her husband but not her.", "NTA. Ellen needs to be mad at her husband, not you. It sounds like he wasn't completely honest with her that he had a \"crush\" on you and that it was NOT reciprocated.", "NTA about this particular thing. But I think you should have done you sister a solid and sent Tom home when he started socializing frequently at your house. Not because of the 'crush' but because presumably she was at home with the baby all the time.", "NTA. Never understood partners taking their frustration on outside parties rather than those who strayed. Tom was the one who had the wondering eye and thoughts, why is Ellen screaming at you? Her issue is with her husband. She needs to lay it at the right door. Especially since you never invited nor encouraged Tom\u2019s unwanted advances. \n\nYes, Ellen needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nIt's awful that you are being blamed by your sister for her husband's emotional infidelity and inappropriate comment. You did nothing wrong. This is just another example of slut shaming where men are never blamed for their reactions because obviously the woman must have tempted him somehow.\n\nBut I am confused why you let this go on for so long without saying anything. Why didn't you immediately tell your sister what Tom had said, instead of keeping it quiet? Why didn't you tell your father the truth a year ago, instead of playing along that you had fallen out?\n\nYou're not an AH, but your silence hasn't helped you in any part of this. The only person you protected was Tom, and to a lesser extent, Ellen. In future, I recommend you speak up immediately about anything like this. There's a difference between creating drama and telling the truth.", "NTA. This mess was created by Tom and then your sister. It was then exacerbated by her lying to your father. Their nightmare of a relationship and poor responses don't mean they get to eff up your relationship with your father, OR that he deserves to be lied to. This is not your mess to clean up.", "NTA; she\u2019s blaming you for her husband\u2019s issues. His eyes wandered, so she blames the person he\u2019s looking at instead of him.", "NTA \n\nbut I'm over here wondering if Tom actually told her this story, or if he told her one in which you had been flirting with him and making moves for months drawing him away. That's a far better look for him than your version of the story here. If that's what she's heard, it makes sense she'd be pissed, in her eyes you tried to steal her husband!", "NTA, hoo boy.\n\nI don't think Tom was truly crushing on you.  You were an ideal- a woman who was giving him the respect and attention he didn't feel like he was getting with his wife\\*.  Sort of a \"grass is always greener\" situation.  Obviously taking your distance is 100% the right thing to do in that scenario, but I'm glad you were able to move past it since it sounds like a temporary thing.\n\nUnfortunately....it sounds like your dad and Ellen don't see it that way.  Ellen, if she truly felt that you and Tom were \"tempted' so to speak, should have been open about it.  And Dad going off on everyone was not great.  But you told the truth, and that's a powerful defense in my book.\n\n\\* Whether or not he was the problem in this scenario is beyond the scope of this inquiry.  But feelings are always real even if they're not justified.", "No you\u2019re not a**hole you\u2019re sister is stuck and blaming you when it wasn\u2019t your fault\u2019; you can\u2019t help if someone is attracted to you,you can\u2019t control that and it wasn\u2019t/isn\u2019t fair you had to carry this burden which weighed heavy on your body/soul.

Anyways, NTA.", "NTA\n\nHow dare you tell other family members the truth!  Based on the maturity level that Ellen has shown in this issue, I have a pretty good idea where the problems in her marriage originate.", "NTA - don't ask if you can't handle the answer.  You Dad responded, not you, you just answered the question in which an answer was demanded.  And not your fault for flirting, that is on Tom.", "INFO: Why did you and your husband enable your sister's husband neglecting his wife and newborn for 8 months? Do you not feel culpable for this at all or consider this part of the reason your sister is mad at you? The crush stuff isn't your fault but your sister has a pretty good reason to be mad at you and your husband.", "Your sister should divorce tom. He's an asshole", "Nope, you should have spilled the very first time she was nasty and tried to hide it.", "NTA. The only thing you did wrong was keep the \"secret\" as long as you did.", "NTA. The fact that she managed to make this your fault tells me she is either an incredibly unreasonable (and possibly insufferable) person, or that Tom didn't actually tell her the full truth and has assigned more blame to you to make himself look better.", "NTA I guess, but still not fully innocent. \n\nIf your sisters husband, so your brother in law, was coming over for quite some time sharing all his marital problems, thats putting you in the middle and crossing a line while also not supporting your sister and taking sides by association. You and your husband should have put an end to it long before he was spending all those days after work at your house hanging out instead of going home to your sister.", "NTA. She wants to blame you for her problems.", "NTA\u2026 your sister is blaming you when she should 100% put the blame on her husband!!!!!", "NTA\n\nYou did the best you could to keep the issue as private as you could.\n\nEllen needs to stop projecting at you & deal with the problems with her husband  & only she can make those decisions.\n\nYour Dad, hard as that may be, needs to take a step back while this works itself through.", "She was mad at YOU for her husband developing a crush, that you never entertained? Wow. Nta", "NTA - None of this would have happened if your sister wouldn\u2019t have acted like a child. That whole thing is ridiculous.", "NTA.", "NTA he should have known all along.  You aren't the cause of this and their marriage isn't Fixed just by not being in the same room.", "Why would your dad call your husband and yell at him?", "Avoiding isn't fixing.  If you can't even be proximate to each other, then perhaps you should join them in a therapy session.", "  NTA, but kind of the TA. I'm slightly questioning why OP's husband was yelled at? Anyway, no one did much stepping over the line except for Ellen, but only slightly. Tom had developed a crush on OP and confessed, then started going to counseling with Ellen to make up for it. I get that she doesn't want to lose her husband since they have a family, but she shouldn't be trying to cut you off because Tom made a small mistake and is trying to make up for it. \n\n   *Edit, I get that it wasn't OP's fault, but if someone can reply why their husband was yelled at, that'd be great", "[deleted]", "You're NTA but your husband is a partial AH here- he should have told his employee to go home long before the drunken slip occurred and not enabled him drinking away his misery at your home every other night for weeks on end. You say in the comments you couldn't make him go home, but you should have banned him from your home and your husband should have been the one to stop him coming over. The fact that your husband didn't even fire Tom after all this etc. makes me think your husband was enjoying social drinking hour with his employee despite Tom's obvious issues which is incredibly irresponsible since he was the only person with the power to tell Tom not to come over and to focus on his wife.", "NTA.

Your sis was already having problems in her relationship and her husband said this not you.  She is blaming you for what he said and her insecurities and dishonesty are on her.

You did absolutely nothing wrong in this situation", "Ellen seems to have a really bad habit of blaming you for her husband\u2019s bs.", "NTA\n\nYour half sister should not make you responsible for her and her husband's problems. You didn't go out of your way to \"seduce\" him. You didn't \"lead him on\" or make him think you reciprocated.

When a relationship is on the rocks, there are people who start looking around and suddenly the people they previously ignored start looking good. It's a sign and symptom of deeper problems. I hope he got it sorted in therapy, but your half sister seems to need more professional help to let go of this jealousy. \n\nIf she deflects the cause of her marital issues to you and to her husband, she has to take less responsibility and bear less of an emotional burden for them. If she's \"the victim\" then she's also \"the good one\" and there's fewer or no things that are really her \"fault\". In fact, the more your fault it is, the more innocent the husband is because he was just led astray, through no fault of his own. \n\nIt's a coping mechanism, but it also prevents her from working on the core of her issues and will ruin her and her husband's relationship between each other and their relationships with others.
