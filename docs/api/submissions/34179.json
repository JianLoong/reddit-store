He became a regular visitor to our house, and began unloading his problems. \n\nThis went on for about 8 months until one evening Tom was quite tipsy and admitted he\u2019d developed \u201ca crush\u201d on me. Understandably, this meant he didn\u2019t come back to our house (he has profusely apologised for this and we\u2019re fine now, but obviously I just prefer some distance).\n\nI guess that whole thing was a wake up call for him because he and Ellen started going to counselling.

He started ranting at me that we needed to grow up and make peace and if we didn\u2019t want to talk to each other fine but not being able to be in the same room was nuts.

He is seething that no one told him and that he has been acting like things are fine with Tom this whole time. Ellen is furious with me for telling Dad, saying I did this on purpose and have ruined things with Tom after she\u2019d worked so hard to fix them.\n\nI feel bad for the results, but I also feel like carrying the burden of this rift that I didn\u2019t cause was unfair on me in the first place.

NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou are not a punching bag for your sister to blame all her life problems on. the only thing you are TA on is not being honest with dad. He deserves to know why his kids are fighting.", "NTA. Other people\u2019s messes were getting in the way of your relationship with your dad, and you had the right to defend yourself by sharing the reality with him.", "NTA.  Shit happens, your sister sounds like she sucks.", "NTA\n\nIt had been going on for a long time - your dad asked and you told him the truth. You should not be expected to lie to your dad about it.\n\nIt should also go in your favour that you shut down his advanced as soon as it happened.", "NTA for spilling but YTA for allowing him to come over for eight months while your sister was home with a new born baby. Do you know how difficult it is in those first few months? Couple that with post partum and martial issues. None of that is you\u2019re fault but I think you guys enabled him and are now  focusing on the wrong part of this. It\u2019s not really about the crush but more about the fact that you allowed her husband to \u201cescape\u201d and drink in your home without so much of a heads up. She feels betrayed. It feels a little weird that you could show compassion to her husband but not her.", "NTA. Ellen needs to be mad at her husband, not you. It sounds like he wasn't completely honest with her that he had a \"crush\" on you and that it was NOT reciprocated.", "NTA about this particular thing. But I think you should have done you sister a solid and sent Tom home when he started socializing frequently at your house. Not because of the 'crush' but because presumably she was at home with the baby all the time.", "NTA. Never understood partners taking their frustration on outside parties rather than those who strayed. Tom was the one who had the wondering eye and thoughts, why is Ellen screaming at you? Her issue is with her husband. She needs to lay it at the right door. Especially since you never invited nor encouraged Tom\u2019s unwanted advances. \n\nYes, Ellen needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nIt's awful that you are being blamed by your sister for her husband's emotional infidelity and inappropriate comment. You did nothing wrong. This is just another example of slut shaming where men are never blamed for their reactions because obviously the woman must have tempted him somehow.\n\nBut I am confused why you let this go on for so long without saying anything. Why didn't you immediately tell your sister what Tom had said, instead of keeping it quiet? Why didn't you tell your father the truth a year ago, instead of playing along that you had fallen out?\n\nYou're not an AH, but your silence hasn't helped you in any part of this. The only person you protected was Tom, and to a lesser extent, Ellen. In future, I recommend you speak up immediately about anything like this. There's a difference between creating drama and telling the truth.", "NTA. This mess was created by Tom and then your sister. It was then exacerbated by her lying to your father. Their nightmare of a relationship and poor responses don't mean they get to eff up your relationship with your father, OR that he deserves to be lied to. This is not your mess to clean up.", "NTA; she\u2019s blaming you for her husband\u2019s issues. His eyes wandered, so she blames the person he\u2019s looking at instead of him.", "NTA \n\nbut I'm over here wondering if Tom actually told her this story, or if he told her one in which you had been flirting with him and making moves for months drawing him away. That's a far better look for him than your version of the story here. If that's what she's heard, it makes sense she'd be pissed, in her eyes you tried to steal her husband!", "NTA, hoo boy.\n\nI don't think Tom was truly crushing on you.  You were an ideal- a woman who was giving him the respect and attention he didn't feel like he was getting with his wife\\*.  Sort of a \"grass is always greener\" situation.  Obviously taking your distance is 100% the right thing to do in that scenario, but I'm glad you were able to move past it since it sounds like a temporary thing.\n\nUnfortunately....it sounds like your dad and Ellen don't see it that way.  Ellen, if she truly felt that you and Tom were \"tempted' so to speak, should have been open about it.  And Dad going off on everyone was not great.  But you told the truth, and that's a powerful defense in my book.\n\n\\* Whether or not he was the problem in this scenario is beyond the scope of this inquiry.  But feelings are always real even if they're not justified.", "No you\u2019re not a**hole you\u2019re sister is stuck and blaming you when it wasn\u2019t your fault\u2019; you can\u2019t help if someone is attracted to you,you can\u2019t control that and it wasn\u2019t/isn\u2019t fair you had to carry this burden which weighed heavy on your body/soul. Your sister should have yelled at him and not you because you\u2019re the innocent bystander caught in the middle of their relationship problems", "This whole story would've been 100% more interesting if Tom developed a crush on your husband instead of you. Anyways, NTA.", "NTA\n\nHow dare you tell other family members the truth!  Based on the maturity level that Ellen has shown in this issue, I have a pretty good idea where the problems in her marriage originate.", "NTA - don't ask if you can't handle the answer.  You Dad responded, not you, you just answered the question in which an answer was demanded.  And not your fault for flirting, that is on Tom.", "INFO: Why did you and your husband enable your sister's husband neglecting his wife and newborn for 8 months? Do you not feel culpable for this at all or consider this part of the reason your sister is mad at you? The crush stuff isn't your fault but your sister has a pretty good reason to be mad at you and your husband.", "Your sister should divorce tom. He's an asshole", "Nope, you should have spilled the very first time she was nasty and tried to hide it.", "NTA. The only thing you did wrong was keep the \"secret\" as long as you did.", "NTA. The fact that she managed to make this your fault tells me she is either an incredibly unreasonable (and possibly insufferable) person, or that Tom didn't actually tell her the full truth and has assigned more blame to you to make himself look better.", "NTA I guess, but still not fully innocent. \n\nIf your sisters husband, so your brother in law, was coming over for quite some time sharing all his marital problems, thats putting you in the middle and crossing a line while also not supporting your sister and taking sides by association. You and your husband should have put an end to it long before he was spending all those days after work at your house hanging out instead of going home to your sister.", "NTA. She wants to blame you for her problems.", "NTA\u2026 your sister is blaming you when she should 100% put the blame on her husband!!!!!", "NTA\n\nYou did the best you could to keep the issue as private as you could.\n\nEllen needs to stop projecting at you & deal with the problems with her husband  & only she can make those decisions.\n\nYour Dad, hard as that may be, needs to take a step back while this works itself through.", "She was mad at YOU for her husband developing a crush, that you never entertained? Wow. Nta", "NTA - None of this would have happened if your sister wouldn\u2019t have acted like a child. That whole thing is ridiculous.", "NTA.", "NTA he should have known all along.  You aren't the cause of this and their marriage isn't Fixed just by not being in the same room.", "Why would your dad call your husband and yell at him?", "Avoiding isn't fixing.  If you can't even be proximate to each other, then perhaps you should join them in a therapy session.", "  NTA, but kind of the TA. I'm slightly questioning why OP's husband was yelled at? Anyway, no one did much stepping over the line except for Ellen, but only slightly. Tom had developed a crush on OP and confessed, then started going to counseling with Ellen to make up for it. I get that she doesn't want to lose her husband since they have a family, but she shouldn't be trying to cut you off because Tom made a small mistake and is trying to make up for it. \n\n   *Edit, I get that it wasn't OP's fault, but if someone can reply why their husband was yelled at, that'd be great", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I gotta agree with your father on this one, as I would most definitely be furious with a SIL disrespecting my daughters.\n\nDoes Tom still work for your husband?", "You're NTA but your husband is a partial AH here- he should have told his employee to go home long before the drunken slip occurred and not enabled him drinking away his misery at your home every other night for weeks on end. You say in the comments you couldn't make him go home, but you should have banned him from your home and your husband should have been the one to stop him coming over. The fact that your husband didn't even fire Tom after all this etc. makes me think your husband was enjoying social drinking hour with his employee despite Tom's obvious issues which is incredibly irresponsible since he was the only person with the power to tell Tom not to come over and to focus on his wife.", "NTA. But you need to email your halfsis EXACTLY what really happened. Because You left out a crucial fact: What did she mean when she said \"\u201cwhat you've done\u201d\"", "Guaranteed the drunk husband didn\u2019t tell her the truth and probably said something like you had a crush on him.

She is always going to be your sister and you must miss her? No? She deserves to hear things from your perspective, even if it's in a letter if you're afraid she won't hear you out. I'd bet her husband blamed *You* for leading him on in some way, possibly even indicating you told him you're attracted to him, or something along those lines. It's time to tell your truth and clear the air. Unless you are not being honest here, your sister is being lied to and that's not fair either.", "You are NTAH.

That he and your SS have been doing counseling and your Dad needs back off.", "Acc to me personally (from what you have told so far atleast)\nNTA\n\nUnless until something is clearly indicated to a person in relationship, this mentality of the other girl MY BF decided to have  a crush on needs to go \n\nAnd if you were being berated over her choice then I can see why someone's patience would leak and you would reveal the truth", "The issue between you and your sister is on her shoulders. Not sure why you kept it from your dad all this time? NTA", "NTA - Ellen and Tom were having issues before he developed feelings, you put a stop to him hanging out even. This is all on Tom and Ellen, Ellen shouldn't have lied to other people either.", "NTA. What a mess. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. You have absolutely no fault in this situation. Your sis was already having problems in her relationship and her husband said this not you.  She is blaming you for what he said and her insecurities and dishonesty are on her. You were the one who had to stick up for yourself when your father started yelling at you. You were the honest one. You were the one who didn't reciprocate Tom's feelings. You did absolutely nothing wrong in this situation", "Ellen seems to have a really bad habit of blaming you for her husband\u2019s bs.", "NTA\n\nYour half sister should not make you responsible for her and her husband's problems. You didn't go out of your way to \"seduce\" him. You didn't \"lead him on\" or make him think you reciprocated. You did nothing wrong. \n\nAnd, with regards to you, he probably didn't do anything wrong either. When a relationship is on the rocks, there are people who start looking around and suddenly the people they previously ignored start looking good. It's a sign and symptom of deeper problems. I hope he got it sorted in therapy, but your half sister seems to need more professional help to let go of this jealousy. \n\nIf she deflects the cause of her marital issues to you and to her husband, she has to take less responsibility and bear less of an emotional burden for them. If she's \"the victim\" then she's also \"the good one\" and there's fewer or no things that are really her \"fault\". In fact, the more your fault it is, the more innocent the husband is because he was just led astray, through no fault of his own. \n\nIt's a coping mechanism, but it also prevents her from working on the core of her issues and will ruin her and her husband's relationship between each other and their relationships with others. She needs help.", "i may be the only one but i am going with esh\n\nyall are all adults, yes?\n\nwhen tom started coming over, you should have shut that down. you/husband are not his therapists. at some point you should have sat the sister down and told her what was happening. for all she knows, you came on to her partner. i doubt he told her the truth\n\nwas she being wrong in who she blamed?  yes, hence the esh", "This is such a benign problem.

It didn't matter that a) he didn't hit on me, he was drunk and fell into me, I helped steady him and it was golden and b) even if he DID hit on me, how the fuck is that my fault?", "She didn\u2019t say anything during the call that made me think she didn\u2019t know the full truth, but I don\u2019t know for sure. \n\nThere have been some stupid issues when were children, and again a few since we\u2019ve both had children (she had body image issues).", "Really good point about Ellen only knowing what Tom told her. For all OP knows, Tom made OP out to be the bad guy.\n\nThat said, it is hardly unknown that the wife of a straying partner, even in possession of the full facts, blames the object of her partner's desire rather than the partner.\n\nOP is nice to be discreet, but once that discretion starts costing her she's entitled to say what's up.\n\nDad's reaction is over the top. He's an asshole here too. He's not owed any info - OP and Ellen are both entitled (but not obligated) to keep that info to themselves.\n\nBut again, given that OP was starting to suffer, she's perfectly within her rights to disclose the facts.", "I agree NTA but letting BIL hang out at their place all the time when they know there is a newborn at home and sis is there all alone isn\u2019t cool at all.", "She may not be mad only because of Tom's feelings, but she may feel betrayed because her husband ranted to her sister about their problems, while she was alone at home with their newborn. I'm sure she thinks they badmouthed her, which honestly they probably did, that's how those convos usually go: \"omg X is such a pain\" \"you're totally right, poor you, she's so annoying\". I'm curious to know what was OP's input during Tom's frequent late night ranting sessions at OP's home. While Ellen is stuck with a newborn. ESH", "NTA, op took no action. It's strange of her to point the finger at you while reconciling with her spouse.", "NTA regarding this specific issue. However, when Tom began hanging out at your house on a regular basis, I believe you ought to have done your sister a favour and sent him home. Not because of the \"crush,\" but rather because she was probably always at home with the infant.", "We pretty much are NC. I only used to see her at big family things, we didn\u2019t speak in between", "Well, OP has no idea what Tom told her sister happened and never bothered to explain the situation to her sister at all. After OP rejected Tom and banned Tom from her home, Tom told OP's sister something(?). \n\nOP's sister then called OP up upset and said \"she and Tom would never be in the same room with me again after 'what I\u2019d done'.' OP didn't ask what sister thought she'd done (clarified in comments) or give sister any information. OP just assumed whatever Tom told her sister must be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, sister is probably crazy. Sister went no contact and OP then covered up what happened further by refusing to explain it to any family and going along with her sister's story that they had a falling out. \n\nBefore we all just blame OP's sister for being mad at OP behavior that was completely on her husband, we should really pay attention to the fact that the only one who has given any version of events to sister is said husband. It  is extremely na\u00efve to just assume Tom told his wife \"I've been avoiding you by drinking after work at your sister's house. She never showed any interest in me but I developed a one sided crush on her. When I finally confessed I was into her she rejected me and banned me from her home. That's why I'm home with you again in the evenings Honey, and why I suddenly want to work on our relationship. Your sister left me no choice.\" \n\nCome on.", "Ikr. The sibling jealousy is really bad. Tom is the one who developed a one sided crush on his SIL. He\u2019s the gross asshole. OP did nothing wrong. And Ellen needs to place her anger where it belongs, on Tom not OP. They clearly need more counseling.", "Eh, they knew the husband was ditching his newborn at home to come over and get drunk for eight months. The crush isn't OP's fault, but they enabled some real shitty parenting", "He thought it was insane that my husband still employs Tom after he admitted how he was feeling.", "Let's be real, if sister allowed herself to get over OP as a non-participant in Tom's crush, that means she would actually have to put the blame on Tom and that's way too scary and could have reprecussions. Her fear at facing truths makes OP the safe target.", "Yeah. OP says Tom told ellen about the incident, but did Tom tell the TRUTH, or a version that didn\u2019t make him look so bad?", "No one else is talking about the baby! OP is NTA but Tom definitely is", "Thank you! I'm so glad someone else noticed that Tom spent *eight months* hanging out at their house drinking most nights while his wife was home with a newborn because \"problems\".

I wouldn\u2019t call any of my husband\u2019s other friends\u2019 wives in that situation, so it felt petty to call Ellen. Also, I knew she would blame me, and She was having issues already, I didn\u2019t want to insert myself further over something that had come to nothing anyway. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell my dad because he reacts explosively to things like this - case in point. I thought Ellen would get over it eventually and just go back to normal and it didn\u2019t need to be the melodrama it has turned into", "Exactly.   OP couldn\u2019t fix this if she wanted to.  And lying isn\u2019t going to help.  \n\nIt sounds like Dad and Ellen are a lot alike-  when something goes wrong- start yelling and blaming people. \n\nMade everyone angry and defensive.", "Nothing she\u2019s ever said has given me the impression that that\u2019s what he said.", "You are totally right about Tom. Everything he said during his \u201cconfession\u201d was basically just saying I was what he imagined being \u201cmarried\u201d looked like (so funny because he saw me for a couple of hours a couple of times a week and thought he knew what my relationship/mothering is like). He just liked the hostess version of me. \n\nMy dad just feels like he\u2019s been duped into being nice to Tom, which he wouldn\u2019t have been if he\u2019d known about his behaviour. He\u2019s also annoyed that Tom still works for my husband but that\u2019s a separate thing", "> I don't think Tom was truly crushing on you.\n\nThat was my first thought when I read the post. Tom wasn't so much crushing on OP, he crushing on the relationship OP and Husband have.

They\u2019re not friends anymore obviously, but he still works there", "They were friends, it seemed fine to have him over.  He never flirted with me or made any overtures before that night where he \u201cconfessed\u201d. We were all just friends having a drink/dinner. \n\nMy husband\u2019s initial reaction was to fire him but I didn\u2019t think he should lose his job over some tipsy stupidity. And ultimately my husband agreed. They just don\u2019t out anymore.", "She doesn\u2019t, or if she does she never said that. I don\u2019t think she thinks I was interested in Tom. We only spoke about it in that one phone call.\n\nIf I\u2019m honest, no I don\u2019t miss her. I only ever saw her at big gatherings and we didn\u2019t talk beyond small talk. We didn\u2019t text or call in between. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t think she\u2019s being lied to, I have no reason to think that. She and Tom have been to therapy and hashed things out, that\u2019s the relationship that needed to be worked on.

It\u2019s not very unclear exactly what you were trying to say. Certain words I feel like shouldn\u2019t be together.", "We weren\u2019t acting as therapists, he and my husband were friends. Yes he shared some issues but no more than you\u2019d share issues with a friend. It would have been a massive overstep for me to tell Ellen what Tom was saying. \n\nI believe Tom told her the truth about what was said to me because she never accused me of initiating anything.", "Exactly! OP + husband both know exactly what was going on.

In what world is that okay?", "We were not in the middle of her marriage. Tom and my husband were friends. He came over and would share things, as my husband\u2019s friend. How does that put us in the middle of anything? \n\nI saw Ellen at family events maybe 6 times a year, and made small talk with her for a few minutes. That\u2019s the extent of our relationship.

If this happened, I'd immediately be asking \"What do you think I did?\" Then explain my side. \n\nYou have no idea what Tom told her and just assuming he told his wife your version of events is extremely na\u00efve.

Has it occurred to you that Tom might have felt that you encouraged his interest in you? Not all men have close female friends and some men are going to see your behavior of hanging out with him in the evenings drinking, listening to his problems/having conversations that involve feelings/being interested in him as intimate/romantic. Yes, your husband was there and I'm not saying you were leading him on. But for some men opening up to each other like that isn't something that happens between genders without it \"meaning something\". Or he may have taken some of your friendly behavior or human compassion as interest/flirting. \n\nMy best is that \"what \\[you\\] did\" is flirt with Tom. Tom may have admitted it was mutual, but I very much doubt he told her it was completely one sided and you have zero interest or attraction to him and kicked him out the second you realized.", "I think NTA, but there is one thing I\u2019m curious about.
