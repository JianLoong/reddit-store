My teacher allows us to pull up chairs and split desks, but we aren\u2019t allowed to pull up desks, which is understandable. On the first day of school, I sat in a desk with 3 other of my friends. My friend came in late and pulled up a chair to share my desk with me, which was fine. My teacher has my name on that desk spot on the seating chart. The next day in class, I find my friend sitting in my desk. I ask if I can share her desk space, to which she says no. I then tried to get her to move out of my spot, but to no avail. She said \u201cI got here first, so this is my desk now.\u201d We\u2019ve been fighting over this spot for literally forever and im sick of it.\n\nFast forward to today. I just ran a mile during my previous gym period, I was exhausted, had 3 bags to carry, super behind in class and needed to work nonstop, etc. You get the picture; I was DONE. I sat at my(?) desk because my friend wasn\u2019t here and I wanted to sit there. She comes in and yells at me to get up. She called me a \u201cwhore\u201d and a \u201cstupid bitch\u201d and claimed she needed it to see the board. Since she is vision impaired, I would have given her my spot. However, even when she has the desk, all she does is play on her phone, eat, never pay attention, etc. She doesn\u2019t even try. She has ADHD, but she weaponizes it so much my math teacher probably thinks she can\u2019t count to 5 by herself. I told her I needed the desk because I had lots of work to do and lots of notes to take. She then asks my friend next to me to get me to move, but my friend tells her that I got here first and she should stop making a scene.\n\nMy friend tries to yank me out of my desk, calls me a whore again, and when I tell her to stop she says \u201cwhy are you taking it so seriously. my day has sucked so far so you should give me the seat.\u201d like I was the problem. I was super fed up with her nagging, and by then all the seats were filled (she could have gotten a whole desk right in front of the board if she didn\u2019t waste her time complaining!) I stood up and screamed \u201cshut your mouth, I don\u2019t give a shit how terrible your day has been cuz you can\u2019t treat me like this. you can either sit your ass down at my desk, stop complaining, and I will share my space with you or you can go find another unlucky victim to annoy.\u201d She moves to another desk right in front of the board where she (shocker!) does\u2019t pay attention the whole class.\n\nAfter school, she blows up all my friends\u2019 phones victimizing herself and claiming I didn\u2019t care about her.
