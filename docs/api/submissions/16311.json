She needs to tell you when her bf is coming over. And you shouldn't have to be uncomfortable in your own home, wearing a blanket in hot weather to avoid showing an adult man your skin. Your sister is being unreasonable. Maybe she should start going to his place instead if she doesn't want to inform her family when she will be having him over.", "NAH - but rolling with the situation with their BFs always around, you should probably lock the door going forwards.", "NAH.\n\nIt's just an accident. It happens. Your sister did nothing wrong, her boyfriend did nothing wrong, and as you didn't know her bf was here, you did nothing wrong (Although if I were you, I'd start locking the door even when it's just you and your family!)", "YTA.\n\nNot for that one particular bathroom situation, accidents happen, but you spent so much time talking about how your sister's boyfriend is always in the house, yet somehow you haven't learned to expect that to be the case.", "Make it a point to lock the bathroom door. People don\u2019t like walking in on someone by accident.\n\nYTA\n\nEdit: if I don\u2019t want to be walked in on by accident I lock the door. To each their own. I guess", "YTA. Your sisters are allowed boyfriends, this is very much a \"you\" problem", "NAH slight YTA. \nIf your parents have no problems, and he hasn\u2019t done anything towards you. Then I hate to say it, but the anxiety thing is more of a YOU problem. Not saying it\u2019s bad. Just neither here nor there. \n\nAnd if everyone is cool with him being there all the time, it\u2019s expected he will have to take a piss every once in a while. Nobody likes being walked in on, nor walking in on someone. \n\nSo NAH, but your only slightly YTA because of expectations.", "NTA on not locking the bathroom door. Though that part was glazed over quickly.  Did he/ your sister even care that that happened? \ud83e\udd14  who even called you an AH for that? \n\nMoreover, Sister should be informing the household before he arrives that he's coming over.  You should not feel uncomfortable in your own home. I'm so sorry.", "NTA. If a bathroom door is closed you knock first.", "NTA as it\u2019s impolite to invite guests without letting the housemates know.", "YTA \n\nLock the door and dress appropriately. Simple solution.", "YTA\n\nHere's your solutions:\n\n1. Dress appropriate when you're in common areas\n2. lock the bathroom door when you use it.", "YTA, there is no reason for you not to lock the door. In addition your anxiety over men is unhealthy.", "<\\_< eww, no, NTA.", "[deleted]", "Soft YTA\n\nYou're in an uncomfortable situation that you know you can't get out of. While I won't shame anyone for their clothing choices, if the boyfriends showing up randomly make you uncomfortable because of what you're wearing, change the things you can control until you feel safe. This goes for locking the door, any door. I lock the bathroom door when I go visit my parents; better safe than having someone walk in by accident.\n\nYou also said your brother was asleep but it was all girls at home. Which was it?", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't related to your problem but I want to point out that using the shortened form \"uncomfy\" instead of uncomfortable for anything that's even remotely serious will lead to people reducing the severity of the problem in their minds. Many people do this because they have an unconscious desire to make sure they aren't upsetting people by using the more serious version of the word, but by using it you're sabotaging yourself. Ill fitting clothes, hard couches, a small bruise, these are uncomfy. A man walking in on you in the bathroom when you didn't even know he was there is uncomfortable.", "NTA, try taking to your parents about how you'd prefer a heads up before the boyfriends come over so you can change from your lounge clothes into regular clothes or retreat to your room.  Maybe try to talk to your sisters as well, that you just want to know when to change clothes, when to lock the bathroom door, that you're just uncomfortable because you never know if they're around or not.  It's not really appropriate for them to bring guests into the family home without telling anyone.  If I had snuck guests in like this I'd have gotten loads of grief from my siblings and mom because they also wear lounge clothing at home and don't want to be seen in states of undress by almost-strangers.  Maybe they don't realize that you consider your lounge clothes to not be actual clothes? Though I don't see how since you'd change before leaving the house.", "You said that you feel uncomfortable in your own home. You shouldn\u2019t have to. Have you discussed this with your parents? Maybe you need to have a sit down with them and talk about this situation. \n\nEveryone in a household should be giving a heads up to the rest if they are having a guest over.\n\nNTA.", "Aside from him walking in on you using the bathroom (could be a simple mistake) has he done anything else to make you feel uncomfortable. Comments, looks, touches etc?\n\nI don't think you should be made to feel like you need to change your clothes in your own home. As long as the important bits are covered (genitals) it really shouldn't matter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut of course NTA for not locking the bathroom door in your own home. I think talk with your sister one more time and ask her to tell you when her bf is coming over so you lock doors/change clothes etc to feel more comfy. If she still refuses involve your parents.", "Nta. Tell your sister to make her guest announce themselves. Miscommunication. I hate coming out my room and seeing extra people too.", "NAH. All of your discomfort seems to be internalized. Walking into the bathroom on people happens. My parents walked in on me a few times not thinking. Beyond that one thing I don't see the bf causing issues. You feel uncomfortable because of the clothes you are wearing in front of him. Does he stare at you? Does he make inappropriate comments?", "NTA but if your sisters are bringing their boyfriends home without your knowledge and you have no privacy start wearing long pants and at least a sports bra . And lock doors when you use the restroom. Better safe than sorry.", "I knock at my own house\u2026 occasionally while home alone. (Which is admittedly too far, but knocking is good sense.)", "OP didn\u2019t specify whether the lights are on.  Normally you knock when there\u2019s a possibility someone is in there, and closed door, especially with the light on, is a clear sign.  Howe paver who turns on the lights at night?  It\u2019s not as obvious when the house is quiet and light off.\n\nSome people keep their bathroom door closed out of habit.  Some people don\u2019t close the door entirely.\n\nThere\u2019s a range of possibilities here such that it could be an understandable mistake", "Well the bf did something wrong.. as far as I can tell he walked through a closed bathroom door without knocking\u2026 she did not say she left the door wide open.. just that it was not locked. i certainly never lock the bathroom door when I am at home.. if the door is closed, you knock, period. Or say heeyyy anyone in there .. you dont just waltz on in", "The first is true. However having to dress with the expectation of guests everyday seems quite annoying.", "Why should OP have to change what she is comfortable in in her own home? Post even says its hot in the house, hence the clothing she chooses to wear for comfort, not attention. \n\nOP, you're NTA. Lots of good advice her of what you could do/change, start with a conversation with your parents/siblings", "I was actually refering to my other older sisters relationship ( jane). its just that me and all the girls in the family were so used to not locking the door besides when we shower or poop. Me and my sister is used to walk around in a bra cause we live in a very hot country.", "I'll disagree on this one.\n\nHad this happened to me, I was sharing a house with several roommates, one of whom had their gf over.  Middle of the night I woke up in a daze, went to the john since my bladder was full, the bathroom door or may not have been closed, to be honest I have no recollection, all I know is I walked through that door and nearly face first into her breasts, no bra,.just in her panties, never found out why she was topless in the bathroom right behind the door, though I needed to go badly I turned right around with a sorry l, closed the door and got some shoes on, and drove down the road to the qt to use the john there.\n\nGranted it was my home and for it to be similar situation shed of had to walk in on him, but I still think it's common courtesy to lock the bathroom when you're using it.\n\nBlaming someone who has to go for walking in on you when you didn't lock the door is a bit silly.\n\nAs for the general situation I agree with op, it sucks... And if she was asking about the general situation, she's definitely not TA.\n\nBut for the bathroom?  Thats sort of on her.", "We don\u2019t keep our bathroom doors open because the dog gets into bathroom stuff. So a closed door doesn\u2019t in any way mean it\u2019s occupied. A locked door means it\u2019s occupied.", "In many households you always close the doors. A closed door isn't a sign someone is in the bathroom", "I literally never knock on a bathroom door if it has a lock on.\nCause it's supposed to be lock if there is someone inside. \n\nYes, it would have been a bit more sensitive of him to knock knowing he is kind of an \"intruder\", but not an asshole just because of this.", "The ultimate answer is how her parents feel about the issue. That\u2019s assuming they live with their parents (OP and sister). If it\u2019s the sister\u2019s house, her rules apply. Parent\u2019s house, their rules apply. \n\nIf they have no problem with sister\u2019s boyfriend being over when he is, then OP needs to deal with that appropriately (ie, wear clothes). \n\nAs for the bathroom, door closed=should knock. For EVERYONE. I lock the door in my own home, because I have a teen stepson and teens/young adults often forget. I don\u2019t see OP locking the door as a hill to die on, it\u2019s not a big deal. Yes, boyfriend should knock, but prevention is simple and worth the negligible effort. \n\nOP isn\u2019t the one with approval/veto power over sister\u2019s boyfriend being there.

No grown man is too dumb to knock on a door. He\u2019s a creeper or coming off as one. He either was raised in a barn with no manners or he\u2019s a perv.", "Definitely nta! You're using the restroom in your own home.

Ever since then I never contacted them and blocked them.\" because if its serious you should def bring it up to your mom.  \n\n\nOther wise NTA, its your house you have a right to know when she invites a guy around", "NTA people should always inform others when there will be a guest unless it's a quick in and out situation", "my mother is fine with him too since hes a good guy, but my sister doesnt really inform my mom too if hes home. I even had to tell my mom once to put a shirt on cause she also didnt know he was home.", "honestly its also dumb that she says \"its too hot to go to his house or its such a long way\" So I always wonder how ralph puts up with her bratty attitude, she also mentioned ralph has his own room, i dont know why they wont even use it.", "i talked to her about it and adressed it nicely, she sounded really rude and I def dont think she considers what I feel 100%.", "although ralph is a very good guy, on the other hand mendez is worse.\n\nhe made racist jokes, made fun of my insecurities, and went through my phone and him and my sister never apologized for it I practically begged for an apology that was 3 months later and never sounded sincere.\n\nhe has also made annoying comments at me before, I clearly told him to stop more than once cause I was out of the mood but he never stopped annoying me.

They deserve a heads up knock too \ud83d\ude24", "If you aren't in your own home,you should err on the side of caution. \n\nIf you ARE in your own home and unaware of any houseguests being around,  as was the case for the OP, you can't be faulted for not locking the door.", "You... pee in the dark?? Got me confused a bit chief ngl", "To be honest your sister seems to be stretching the rules of hospitality a bit.\n\nMoreover your mom should, as a reasonable person, take into consideration their teenage daughter when deciding on semi permanent 20 and up boys in the home. \n\n Seems a NTA in the end", "That sucks :( I'm sorry :(\n\nMaybe counseling to help figure out how to address the situation? And to help yourself not feel as uncomfortable (if that's what is needed, idk)", "You should take this to your parents ASAP", "That's totally possible", "That is unfortunate but that is something you have to work through and deal with. If he is doing nothing to deserve being mistrusted then the only AH is you. You can speak with your sister about it, but at the end of the day a boundary is something that you state you will do if something happens. Example: I am going to stay in my room if he is over. You cannot set rules. Example: your bf can't come over because I feel uncomfortable.", "Mostly agreed.\n\nHowever having strangers in the house is a burden. Even if the parents aren't bothered with it they should take into consideration everyone else who might be bothered. Otherwise they are are simply unreasonable people. \n\nConsidering the clothes. Well if someone is in the house more than half the time are they even guests? Here we have the saying \"they are part of the furniture\".", "Why? It's common courtesy to lock the door when your use the bathroom in my family. Makes a lot more sense than always knocking on a door", "Guess at this point he\u2019s not a stranger. \n\nHowever, my judgment still stands, in my mind. It is not unreasonable to expect a member of the household to be decently dressed, guests or no guests, if outside their room/bathroom. \n\nIf the parents don\u2019t consider it a burden to have him over, and OP doesn\u2019t have to do anything for him (save dressing when outside her bedroom/bathroom), it isn\u2019t a burden on her. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion with kids, but a 15 year old doesn\u2019t make the rules or dictate what happens in the home, at least not in situations like this. If he was doing something to her, that would be different. But it seems she is just annoyed that he\u2019s there so much. He\u2019s not harming her, or really affecting her."]}
