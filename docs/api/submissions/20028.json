Why did you let the water run out?

If the genders were switched there would be way more comments about him not pulling his weight. It gets tiring to be the person who always has to 'keep on top of everything'. It also sounds like you had plenty of chances to go and get the water but you were too lazy too.

I also had an issue where tasks that should be important but relatively non-urgent get pushed back because of my difficulty in remembering to do them or feeling too physically drained to make myself do them. I realized after being diagnosed with ADHD that these were symptoms that improved a lot with treatment and customized organizational skills.\n\nThis does not negate the fact that I still think OP is YTA in this scenario, but I wonder if this is something she feels is affecting her life in general and would help to get assessed by a healthcare professional.  \n\n\nEdit: grammar", "It's hard to say. Do you routinely put off doing the  things you have agreed are your responsibility because you don't pay attention to them and complain you are drained or you want to rest because you forgot?

I'm not sure if it's an issue of \"respect,\" but it may be his way of saying that he feels like you don't care about him.\n\nFrom your post it sounds like there may be a larger power struggle issue between you. Please be adults and work it out.  Both of you should articulate your boundaries to the other and stick to them.", "YTA. If it's your job to get groceries and water, shouldn't you be keeping an eye on when you need these things? Of course, he could remind you so you pick up water on the way home, but isn't the point of having separate chores so you take care of the things on your plate? \n\nWhy cop an attitude? It was your own poor planning that led to running out. At least you could have said, I'm sorry, I'm just so tired. Let me rest for another half hour then I'll go out. \n\nPeople might say he is perfectly capable of getting the water himself (and could have any time over the day he knew it was out), but I think the issue is more that you acknowledge that something is your job but you just don't care to do it even when it inconveniences him. \n\nIf you don't agree with the job divisions, talk about that with him!", "YTA.  You admit that getting water is your responsibility and that you failed to do it, and you think he\u2019s TA for getting frustrated that you won\u2019t do it?

Expected him to do your chores for you because you prioritized going out to have fun? \n\nAnd you made it sound like your husband frequently has to complain about you not meeting your obligations. \n\nI'm also guessing he never expects you to do his chores for him, based on your other comments, which means you are habitually not pulling your weight, OP.\n\nDo better.", "YTA.\n\nSo what you've told us is that you did nothing all day and then started a fight because you were asked to do the thing thats literally your responsibility.

It's healthy if it's give and take, we arent robots after all, we can't always be expected to do everything perfect and on time and it works both ways.\n\nHe should get his ass in the car and pick it up next time and remember it the next time he's tired and you pick up his slack.", "NTA.\nI mean, if it\u2019s been needed all day and he opted to wait to give you an order to do it then it sounds like his confuses respect with you saying, \u201cyes sir, right now sir\u201d and that\u2019s concerning. \nDoesn\u2019t matter who primarily does something - if / when it really matters and you notice it, step up and do it.", "NTA.
