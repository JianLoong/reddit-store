I could share a few that work for me if you're interested, but you can find them online easily.\n\nI'd also recommend you speak to your husband about the fact that you're facing this problem. He perceives your neglect of tasks as disrespect because he does not know what's actually going on, when in fact you are going through a very valid neurotransmitter imbalance.

I mean I get being tired and exhausted from family, some of them can be like that but not buying water when it ran out the previous day is a very irresponsible thing to do. I think I know why your husband feels disrespected. Because he feels like he is doing all of his side of things as well as running a business and he can't rely on you for stuff like having water at home. \n\nThe best way to combat this is to create a reminder system. My husband has it. He puts reminders for everything. Like every Friday he has a reminder for laundry so I don't have to remind him to do it. He has ADHD and often used to have problem with remembering stuff or actively doing them. The reminders on phone, a check list on the fridge and always associating the chore with some song has helped him a lot. Like every week he will decide a song he wants to play while he cooks or does laundry or vacuums and it makes it fun for him. Maybe try something like this. \n\nAlso, maybe get checked for ADHD, my husband got diagnosed 1.5 years ago after I saw signs and told him maybe he should get it checked. \n\nAs for specifically water, look into delivery service.
