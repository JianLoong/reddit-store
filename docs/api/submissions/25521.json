Here lately I've been looking at the new x boxs and have said several times I would like one but cannot fathom the price tag of them. My birthday was last week and today after work the wife took me over to get some parts for my grandpa's old truck I inherited after we went to eat at a little sit down restraunt we like. After she said she wanted to run into the local game store to look at something she took me in and told the guy she wanted to buy a new x box. She then immediately turned to me and said happy birthday. I told her no and that it is to much and proceded to tell her if she has that much money floating on the side maybe we could use it on something for the family. Immediately after she got really hurt and left the store. She has been short with me ever since.\n\nI kind of think IATAH because I rejected something my wife worked hard to get and hurt her feelings. But I also feel like I am not because I would like any free money to go towards her and my son.\n\n\nEdit: sorry it was a xbox 1 originally. Also I ended up accepting it after we went to a second store to get some things for my son and they had the same one but a bit cheaper and thanked her for it. I got it all set up last night and let it start its thing on downloading and updating. I woke her up briefly at 5am to tell her I appreciated it and that I was/am still in shock that she went through all that trouble and expense for my birthday. For those saying about the money we share bank accounts and she has been saving this money on the side without me noticing. Like taking 10 bucks here or there and also she flips rummage finds on the side. Normally we don't buy each other gifts and just give our sons money to buy something or make something for mom or dad.", "created_utc": 1693018641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/161jb8l/aitah_wife_saved_up_for_months_to_buy_me_a/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Would you buy something for yourself on her birthday and tell her that's her gift?  If no, then what makes you think you can tell her to buy something for herself as your gift and expect it to be ok?", "YTA - she saved up for a long time just so she could do something nice for you and you trashed it and basically spat it out.  You made her feel like dirt.  You think you're being \"nice\" because you want to use it on something for her, but did you ever think it might make her feel good to do something nice for you?  You took that away from her.", "What an ass. Lol. That last sentence is all well and good, but she ALSO has that same sentiment to you. I can't even fathom pulling something like that to my SO. Please apologize. YTA.", "Unless you need it for bills YTA. She worked hard to do something nice for you and you were rude. This is something that will be fun for her family and that\u2019s what was important to her.", "Wow YTA! She scraped and saved to buy you what you have been saying you want and you respond with no thanks.", "Slight YTA. Veeeeery slight, because I see where you're coming from. But just like you're willing to sacrifice luxuries for your family, your wife is also willing to sacrifice luxuries for your family. A long and very caring conversation with wife is called for here.", "Im confused this was a gift for the family? It was for you and your son. Your excuse makes no sense whatsoever and really just seems like you\u2019re insecure about her buying it for you. You obviously know you hurt her?? YTA", "Soft YTA - not for the sentiment, which is noble, but for how you expressed it. Put yourself in your wife\u2019s shoes for a moment. How would it feel to have a thoughtful gift, one that you\u2019ve scrimped and saved for, publicly rejected?\n\nJust apologize to her and explain that you would truly get more enjoyment from a family experience than having a luxury item for yourself.", "YTA. \n\nI understand where you're coming from, but I think she WAS trying to do something nice for her family: you and your son. If she saved for it and it won't negatively affect your life, then it should have been something you accepted.\n\nIf this is me, she wasn't sure what to give you, thought of an activity that brings you joy, and decided to make it happen. It's not an insignificant amount of money, but if you've held onto your Xbox 360 this long, it might not be a bad upgrade for you.", "YTA just let her do something nice for you, damn", "Soft YTA. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but in this case your wife worked hard to save up, and if you had graciously accepted it, it would have filled you both with joy. Instead you both feel bad.", "Yes YTA..  she was proud to be able to do that for you and for your son, and you threw it back in her face because it wasn't  \"practical\" in your mind.  Wow.  How shitty is your life that you can't even feign being grateful?", "YTA.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t need to do it at the store.  You could have thanked her first and then after your birthday had the discussion about it being too expensive and needing to return it.\n\nI don\u2019t like expensive gifts, it makes me feel guilty and needing to reciprocate but some people like giving so there needs to be a balance.  I get where you are coming from but I think you could have handled in better", "YTA and it is something for the family? Your son could have the old Xbox and you could sell the ps4? I understand where you're coming from but she wanted to do something nice for you and probably busted her ass to do it.", "YTA even though this rings a bit of The Gift of the Magi. Look, she saved the money for your birthday present. Birthday presents shouldn't always be practical. It sounds like you have wanted a new XBOX for years and never allotted the means to get it. She allotted the means to get it for you. Did you ask her what she sacrificed to get the money? No. You just decided that whatever she went through, or did, to get it wasn't worth it. How would you feel if she treated you like that? That your efforts was worthless? If you say you wouldn't care then I'm calling you out as a liar. Sometimes we do something special for those we love because they won't do it themselves. Don't be an idiot.", "That\u2019s how I know this story is generated. You can\u2019t even play fork knife on an Xbox 360 \ud83e\udd23", "But you literally play the xbox with your son, so this is money invested in the family on something you have also talked about wanting. Dude, be gracious and accept the gift.", "YTA and that would be the last gift I would attempt to give you. A woman with self respect isn\u2019t going to go for a second time to be spit in the face.", "OP, YTA, but lightly. You both have the absolute best of intentions, but your rejection of her present must have cut deeply. Take a deep breath, regroup, and let her give you something that brings you joy, and her by extension. She loves your giving heart, and in some ways, surprising the giver is just as meaningful. She's gotten you this so you and your son can play Fortnite more easily. She wants you guys to share something. That's a beautiful intangible gift she's giving you.\n\nYou know what You could do?  Start anew. A new day. Make her breakfast if you have the ingredients at home. Maybe go for a walk together. Let her know that your rash words weren't meant to diminish anything she did, that you are touched and honored, and would be honored to accept the birthday present.\n\nThen do something special for her, small or large, the thought and gesture are what count. Does she like backrubs? Give her one until she melts. Does she like to soak in the tub? Set up a bubble bath for her. Not sure what to do for dinner? Maybe you and oldest son could make something together. Do you both have a show you like to steam or a movie you've been wanting to see.\n\nLet her know that she is cherished, and make certain she knows that your reaction came from a place of pure love, and you know that upset her.\n\nAnd if the budget allows for it,  start saving little by little and paying close attention to things she might like for Christmas.", "NAH. You obviously love one another and your family. You would rather have something for her and your son. She felt the same and wanted something for you and your son. I would imagine if you talked to one another about it, you could find one together that would make you both happy.", "I mean, bro, isn't an xbox like four hundred bucks or something like that. I mean, I know money gets tight, but if 400 dollars It's going to break the bank, maybe you should be playing a little less video games and maybe getting a second job.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Go say sorry and admit that you were an idiot.  Tell that you are stressed about money and that you forgot to consider it from her point of view.  Ask her if she would reconsider the present and if she would play with you....  Also, tell her what you love language is for future reference - it is obviously not gifts.", "I was looking at it as if she wanted to do something for me to bring me joy. Why not do something to bring them joy and it would make me 10x happier then any x box could ever make me.", "You also did not reject the parts she got you", "Lol. You realize thats the reality for most people in North America right? 400 dollars is literally not being able to afford rent for most people. Most people are one paycheck away from being homeless.", "There is no evidence that bills were not being paid.", "This isn\u2019t about paying bills. He wants to do something nice for her, and the kid, with the money that she purposely saved up to purchase his birthday present of a new Xbox.", "You didn't answer my question.  Would you buy something for yourself on her birthday and call it her gift?", "So you see how you took her joy by refusing the gift", "I don't really ever buy anything for myself. Unless it's tools for work as I a mechanic by trade.", "So your answer is no, you would never do that.  Apologize, accept her gift, and say nothing but thank you.", "I hope OP understands where you went with this.  Such a perfect way to explain it.  I would be hurt, too. The wife knows OP is a giver (hence his wanting to \u201cgive\u201d his gift away).  She wants to give to him and he took that experience away from her.", "Based on their responses, they did not get it.", "YTA\n\nShe was trying to do something nice and you totally shemped on it.  No wonder she\u2019s angry.", "NTA. Comments to the contrary are so wrong. Assuming what you\u2019re saying is true and money is tight, it\u2019s simply smart if you to decline spending on something like that. You\u2019re not going to enjoy it anyway, knowing the cost. This is a tough pill of financial discipline.", "YTA. You stole her joy and what's worse, you explained it in a way that makes it sound like you are being more thoughtful than she was because you are thinking of \"the family\" more than she. What nonsense.  \n\n\nYou probably won't get this but you are being incredibly self-centered. This was for you and your son to enjoy and you threw it back in her face like her sacrifice and care for both of you wasn't good enough. Definitely YTA.", "YTA.  Not only did you reject a very thoughtful gift, that she scrimped and saved for, you did it in front of someone else\u2026embarrassment to injury.  That is a real slap in the face.", "YTA. Your hearts in the right place but she wanted to buy you a gift. Just apologize.", "YTA but I get it. It\u2019s hard to spend money on something just for yourself when you think what else that money could go to (and when money is tight). I will say though that your wife has been saving for months, imagining your face when you get a brand new console of your own, imagining seeing you and your oldest playing something together, so excited to give you that joy. You popped that for her, and embarrassed her in public with your reaction. That\u2019s why she\u2019s upset. \n\nMaybe you guys can compromise- you apologise wholeheartedly, and then see if you can buy a secondhand one (I don\u2019t actually know if they\u2019re around- I\u2019m the wife of a gamer not a gamer myself haha) and use the difference on a family treat like a meal or a day out somewhere? \n\nTell her that she did something immensely thoughtful and you realise you were wrong, and that spending time with her and your family gives you more joy than a brand new console. Then do the work of finding the secondhand one and say that if she\u2019s still willing, you would love to play with (son) and she was right- that\u2019s a great gift. \n\nYour wife obviously loves you very much, and she wants you to have genuine joy for yourself not *only* generous joy shared with the family. You can fix this.", "This exactly. I bought my husband a switch when it took me a long while to save for it (they started out very expensive in Australia!) because he gets SO much joy playing and talking about games with his brother. \n\nIt was expensive, but he\u2019s a simple dude that doesn\u2019t have that many things he wants. I thought about what he really likes doing and the only hobby that had something I could get for him was this. Great gift, that thing travels in his work bag for the commute every single day.", "This is EXACTLY like the gift of the magi, which is a great illustration why it was wise to say no.", "lol the joy was buying that for you and your son! smh", "This comment seals it: YTA.\n\nFor crying out loud, even Jesus allowed the prostitute to pour out expensive perfume all over him. You could learn a lesson from him about how to receive a gift graciously: not because YOU 'need' it, but because the other will benefit from giving it. \n\nIf you think you're more loving than Jesus, I really hope you seek help. (And no, I'm not trying to make this about religion. Just... the pseudo 'loving' nonsense OP is giving about how he rejects his wife's gifts because he's happier watching her receive gifts... something seems self-aggrandizing about that, and that's why I'm making a comparison to someone authentically, while humbly, grand. And that person could receive gifts graciously.) \n\nStarting my comment off this way has also moderated my temptation to use much harsher language. Suffice to say... OP, I sincerely hope you  allow yourself to undergo a paradigm shift. To love is to will the good of the other, and it is good for the other to GIVE, not just to receive. It is always psychologically easier to give than to receive, to be the hero rather than the helped, but you (like the rest of us) need to learn to just smile and thank someone when they do something nice for us. Receive the precious gift they're offering, recognize it for the fragile and valuable treasure it is; don't shatter it on the floor in front of them and make them despondent by your lack of appreciation. If it helps: think of it as a new way for *you* to give a gift: the gift of allowing others to give their gifts. Receiving graciously is an act of generosity to others. I hope you grow in this. (And I hope your wife's heart heals soon from the hurt she felt when you turned what she hoped would be a moment of happiness into instead a public rejection.)", "She wanted to do something nice for you I bet she won't bother again on a side note how much do you spend on expensive parts for said vehicle", "If she saved up for it (not putting it on credit) you should have let her get it for you. \n\nIf not you still should have had a gentle conversation with her about it, at home.", "Soft YTA here. From reading your other comments, my husband is a lot like you. He doesn\u2019t allow himself to get things he wants, or even things he needs, because he feels guilty spending the money even though we can easily afford it. It\u2019s a throwback to his childhood since he grew up on the poverty line. The only reason he has some of the things he has is because I got them for him.\n\nYour wife ultimately wanted the same thing you wanted, to see her SO happy and bring them joy, but you denied her that. Maybe speak to her about another option for the money, but make sure it\u2019s a fun thing your family will use and not a necessity.", "YTA, she wanted to get you something that brings you joy with your son and rejecting it like that was hurtful. Also the 360 is being taken off-line at the end of the year so you will need to upgrade anyway. Just take the console and say thank you to your wife.", "Fortnite isn't on 360", "NAH and I hope you and your wife have a good conversation about this.

I kept that to myself and in the end I was the one who had to break my ass to pay for it all..we went to the gig but the financial fall out hell that went with it all was horrible. It was tainted for me sadly.", "Seriously.  Stfu. Clueless.", "Err, no. In The Gift of the Magi, two people each give up something very important to them so they can afford a thoughtful gift for their SO. Ironically, the gifts are associated with the very thing they each gave up, rendering them useless.\n\nIn OP\u2019s story, his wife worked hard to give him something he\u2019s wanted for a long time, and he just said nope. It\u2019s like The Gift of the Magi, but completely one-sided.", "Damn, you must need money for an Xbox too..", ">Money has been kind of tight lately.\n\nYah that trumps your god b.s. you don't get the family in debt over something they cant afford.", "I'm going to go NAH.\n\nWhat OP did was an absolute reflex response whenever someone who is used to managing on very tight finances is offered a luxury.\n\n\"What else could that be spent on?\" is literally the first thing that runs through your head.\n\nIt leads to hurt feelings and the appearance of ingratitude but in reality it's a small financial panic attack that is very difficult to mitigate in the moment.", "NAH- I see both sides to this. Yes it\u2019s a birthday gift and she was trying to do something nice that you would 100% like. But from your perspective the money could be used for the entire family.

But then you guilt her saying it should be spent on other things. Then you rationalize buying the thing anyway because you get it slightly cheaper at a different store. Then you wait to rank her until 5 am the next day and wake her up?\n\nYTA. How can you even question that? Waking her up at 5am was brought to make you TA, let alone the rest.", "Where is the logic? He wanted to use the money for something everyone could enjoy rather than something just for him. Yes yes it\u2019s his bday, so? His wife\u2019s bday has nothing to do with it, this is what **he** would have rather had. That\u2019s all that should matter. I don\u2019t see how either of them could be wrong.
