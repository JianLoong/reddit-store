Would you buy something for yourself on her birthday and tell her that's her gift?  If no, then what makes you think you can tell her to buy something for herself as your gift and expect it to be ok?", "YTA - she saved up for a long time just so she could do something nice for you and you trashed it and basically spat it out.  You made her feel like dirt.  You think you're being \"nice\" because you want to use it on something for her, but did you ever think it might make her feel good to do something nice for you?  You took that away from her.", "What an ass. Lol. That last sentence is all well and good, but she ALSO has that same sentiment to you. I can't even fathom pulling something like that to my SO. Please apologize. YTA.", "Unless you need it for bills YTA. She worked hard to do something nice for you and you were rude. This is something that will be fun for her family and that\u2019s what was important to her.", "Wow YTA! She scraped and saved to buy you what you have been saying you want and you respond with no thanks.", "Slight YTA. Veeeeery slight, because I see where you're coming from. But just like you're willing to sacrifice luxuries for your family, your wife is also willing to sacrifice luxuries for your family. A long and very caring conversation with wife is called for here.", "Im confused this was a gift for the family? It was for you and your son. Your excuse makes no sense whatsoever and really just seems like you\u2019re insecure about her buying it for you. You obviously know you hurt her?? YTA", "Soft YTA - not for the sentiment, which is noble, but for how you expressed it. Put yourself in your wife\u2019s shoes for a moment. How would it feel to have a thoughtful gift, one that you\u2019ve scrimped and saved for, publicly rejected?\n\nJust apologize to her and explain that you would truly get more enjoyment from a family experience than having a luxury item for yourself.", "YTA. \n\nI understand where you're coming from, but I think she WAS trying to do something nice for her family: you and your son. If she saved for it and it won't negatively affect your life, then it should have been something you accepted.\n\nIf this is me, she wasn't sure what to give you, thought of an activity that brings you joy, and decided to make it happen. It's not an insignificant amount of money, but if you've held onto your Xbox 360 this long, it might not be a bad upgrade for you.", "YTA just let her do something nice for you, damn", "Soft YTA. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but in this case your wife worked hard to save up, and if you had graciously accepted it, it would have filled you both with joy. Instead you both feel bad.", "Yes YTA..  she was proud to be able to do that for you and for your son, and you threw it back in her face because it wasn't  \"practical\" in your mind.  Wow.  How shitty is your life that you can't even feign being grateful?", "YTA.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t need to do it at the store.  You could have thanked her first and then after your birthday had the discussion about it being too expensive and needing to return it.\n\nI don\u2019t like expensive gifts, it makes me feel guilty and needing to reciprocate but some people like giving so there needs to be a balance.  I get where you are coming from but I think you could have handled in better", "YTA and it is something for the family? Your son could have the old Xbox and you could sell the ps4? I understand where you're coming from but she wanted to do something nice for you and probably busted her ass to do it.", "YTA even though this rings a bit of The Gift of the Magi. Look, she saved the money for your birthday present. Birthday presents shouldn't always be practical. It sounds like you have wanted a new XBOX for years and never allotted the means to get it. She allotted the means to get it for you. Did you ask her what she sacrificed to get the money? No. You just decided that whatever she went through, or did, to get it wasn't worth it. How would you feel if she treated you like that? That your efforts was worthless? If you say you wouldn't care then I'm calling you out as a liar. Sometimes we do something special for those we love because they won't do it themselves. Don't be an idiot.", "That\u2019s how I know this story is generated. You can\u2019t even play fork knife on an Xbox 360 \ud83e\udd23", "But you literally play the xbox with your son, so this is money invested in the family on something you have also talked about wanting. Dude, be gracious and accept the gift.", "YTA and that would be the last gift I would attempt to give you. A woman with self respect isn\u2019t going to go for a second time to be spit in the face.", "OP, YTA, but lightly. You both have the absolute best of intentions, but your rejection of her present must have cut deeply. Take a deep breath, regroup, and let her give you something that brings you joy, and her by extension. She loves your giving heart, and in some ways, surprising the giver is just as meaningful. She's gotten you this so you and your son can play Fortnite more easily. She wants you guys to share something. That's a beautiful intangible gift she's giving you.\n\nYou know what You could do?  Start anew. A new day. Make her breakfast if you have the ingredients at home. Maybe go for a walk together. Let her know that your rash words weren't meant to diminish anything she did, that you are touched and honored, and would be honored to accept the birthday present.\n\nThen do something special for her, small or large, the thought and gesture are what count. Does she like backrubs? Give her one until she melts. Does she like to soak in the tub? Set up a bubble bath for her. Not sure what to do for dinner? Maybe you and oldest son could make something together. Do you both have a show you like to steam or a movie you've been wanting to see.\n\nLet her know that she is cherished, and make certain she knows that your reaction came from a place of pure love, and you know that upset her.\n\nAnd if the budget allows for it,  start saving little by little and paying close attention to things she might like for Christmas.", "NAH. You obviously love one another and your family. You would rather have something for her and your son. She felt the same and wanted something for you and your son. I would imagine if you talked to one another about it, you could find one together that would make you both happy.", "I mean, bro, isn't an xbox like four hundred bucks or something like that. I mean, I know money gets tight, but if 400 dollars It's going to break the bank, maybe you should be playing a little less video games and maybe getting a second job.", "Pay bills first, new Xbox second.

Go say sorry and admit that you were an idiot.  Tell that you are stressed about money and that you forgot to consider it from her point of view.  Ask her if she would reconsider the present and if she would play with you....  Also, tell her what you love language is for future reference - it is obviously not gifts.", "I was looking at it as if she wanted to do something for me to bring me joy. Why not do something to bring them joy and it would make me 10x happier then any x box could ever make me.", "You also did not reject the parts she got you", "Lol. You realize thats the reality for most people in North America right? 400 dollars is literally not being able to afford rent for most people. Most people are one paycheck away from being homeless.", "There is no evidence that bills were not being paid.", "This isn\u2019t about paying bills.

Would you buy something for yourself on her birthday and call it her gift?", "So you see how you took her joy by refusing the gift", "I don't really ever buy anything for myself. Unless it's tools for work as I a mechanic by trade.", "So your answer is no, you would never do that.  Apologize, accept her gift, and say nothing but thank you.", "I hope OP understands where you went with this.  Such a perfect way to explain it.  I would be hurt, too.
