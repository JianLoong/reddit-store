He\u2019s been in and out of rehab several times and I\u2019ve stood by him through it. I did everything I could to support him, and neglected myself and my needs to do so \n\nLast month, I got home from a work trip and he was nowhere to be found. He came home a day after and looked terrible. He broke down crying and apologising. I thought he was apologising for relapsing. I held him and allowed him to cry. After a few minutes, he said he had something important to tell me and that he was so sorry. Basically his ex girlfriend from before he met me, who he had introduced him to the drugs, was back in town a few months ago and she wanted to catch up. He said he didn\u2019t feel the pressure to be perfect around her because she has the same issues as him, and that he felt safe. He said he feels like a failure around me because I don\u2019t suffer from addiction, but it\u2019s different with her. Long story short, they slept together a few months ago and she\u2019s pregnant. He relapsed after she told him she was pregnant (1 month ago). He wasn\u2019t under the influence when they slept together, he was still clean at that point. \n\nI was heartbroken, and broke up with him immediately. He has been doing a lot worse since I broke up with him and his family are really worried. I cut off contact with him so he told his mom to tell me that he\u2019ll go to rehab if I give him another chance to make it right with me. I told his mom that there is no way I\u2019m getting back with him and being a step mom to the child he conceived while cheating on me. I\u2019m done and I\u2019m not going back.

Realistically I know it won\u2019t be my fault but it\u2019s starting to get to me now. Should I really sacrifice myself to him again so he can go to rehab?

You know you are not responsible. You also know you can\u2019t \u201csave\u201d him. Bring the family member of an addict is so difficult and traumatizing in many ways. They are unfortunately reacting the way many do, but it\u2019s not right or healthy or helpful. NTA. Do what you need to do to protect yourself and to not be sucked in to the manipulation. You can\u2019t do a single thing for him by getting back together.", "NTA. This internet stranger agrees that his actions are Not Your Fault. He's responsible for him. You're responsible for looking after you, and it sounds as though you're making good decisions about that. \n\nHis family and friends are doubtless thinking with their hearts, not their heads, and they are probably feeling quite desperate - but they are being MASSIVELY unfair and unreasonable putting this on you.", "NTA all of his friends and family need to leave you alone and concentrate on getting him into rehab.  I can\u2019t believe any of them are OK with him cheating on you, and now, manipulating you and trying to make you responsible for his sobriety. You\u2019re done, you\u2019re out.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. No, it will not be your fault. It will be their fault because even now they are still making excuses for him. Those are not your friends.", "Nta. Dude chose this. You didn't. NO is a one word sentence. His sobriety shouldn't be dependent on your willingness to be with him. He's an addict, it's up to him to make better choices. Block anyone who makes you question your self worth and your morals. Fafo", "NTA. He had the choice between enjoying being out of the hole with you or wallowing in the hole with her and he chose the hole. It is not your responsibility to pull him back out of something he chose.", "Fuck that noise. You didn't give him the drugs. You didn't make him knock up his ex. His own actions did that. If he dies, it'll be his own actions. Do your best to forget him and his family.", "NTA\n\nHe's self destructive, fucked around and found out. You aren't responsible for any of this or suffering the consequences.", "NTA. You have been together for 6 years. He has not stayed sober. That should be proof that YOU cannot make him stay sober. For his family and friends to think it would be different this time is ridiculous. They don't want to take care of him. They want you to do it. They all need to talk to an addiction counselor to set them straight.  Let him and his family go.", "No. NTA. You don\u2019t reward that type of behavior or accept any responsibility for it.", "NTA! Proud of you for calling it off! Going back to him would be enabling the same addictive cycles. Look up the classic relationship dynamic between an addict and a codependent. It doesn\u2019t help anyone for you to give yourself up. If he wants to get clean he ultimately has to do that entirely for himself. He\u2019ll never do it longterm for you. \n\nRun! And get into some therapy to work through the need to self destructively harm yourself by being a rescuer to someone who doesn\u2019t want to be saved.", "NTA. People pressuring and blaming you are way out of line.", "NTA and not your burden. He made his bed, he might not get the chance to live in it but that is not on you. Block him and his family and move on.", "NTA NTA NTA. OP please hold it inside you that this is a grown man battling a disease. The symptoms and effects of his disease, ie relapse, overdose, etc will never be your fault. You\u2019ve spent years dedicated to trying to help, but even so if you continue it will not work. Why? Because he isn\u2019t trying to get sober for himself. It\u2019s time for you to heal and do what\u2019s best for you. Al-Anon is a great support group for loved ones of addicts as well.", "Nta\n1. He screwed up and screwed his ex\n2. He blamed you for his cheating (manipulater)\n3. He got his family involved to harass you and break you down to take him back and suffer for the rest of yr time\n4. He lied to you for months and may have exposed you to stds, the only reason you know is because she is pregnant\n\nThis person does not love or respect you, he is using you and his family is enabling his issues\nCut off all contact and live your life, this person and his family of clowns, seems they just want you to deal with him so they don't have to.", "NTA, 100%. I\u2019m so sorry your going through this. Your BF was unable to stay clean while you were together, so there is no reason to assume he would stay clean now. It isn\u2019t your responsibility to help him get sober.\n\nIf you keep getting flack from family and friends, tell them that getting back together with BF would be enabling him. Maybe when he hits rock bottom it will be a wake up call.", "NTA. Addiction is a disease. He needs treatment from professionals.", "NTA\n\nWould they say the same if you had gotten pregnant from your ex? Doubt it. It's the expectation that women are supposed to sacrifice everything for their man -be the rock, not have personal needs- bullshit.", "NTA. You did what you could and you've made the right decision. Cut all ties to his family as well.", "NTA!!!", "NTA\n\nRun now, or be forty -something with a addict ex and *years* of extra regrets.", "NTA\n\nIf he can't bring himself to go to rehab for the sake of his child, he probably wouldn't successfully complete rehab for you either. I am not an expert, but it's my understanding that people have to genuinely want to get help for the help to work. If he says he'll only get help if certain conditions are met, he probably wouldn't succeed in staying clean because he could just mentally move those goal posts again.\n\nI'm not an expert on addiction or mental health counseling. I may be wrong. But emotionally manipulating you into a relationship that you do not want to be in is not a solid foundation for success, in my opinion.\n\nFor yourself, you might want to go to an Al Anon meeting. It's a support group for people who know someone experiencing addiction. They might be able to give you better support as someone who has lived through it themselves.", "NTA. He made the choice to meet up with the person who introduced him to drugs, he knew it was a bad idea and he did it anyway then tried to blame you for it because HE felt he \"had to be perfect\" which you never expected of a partner. You just expected him to try to stay sober. \n\nPretty much most rehab programs advise against hanging out with your old drug buddies in any form as it is more likely to lead to a relapse than not. \n\nYou are not responsible for the choices he has made. You are not responsible for him living or dying. He can choose to get help, he's done it before. You do not need to burn down your life or future to keep him warm. \n\nThe responsibility of his sobriety is on him alone. He has to do it for himself. You cannot make someone sober or keep them from doing drugs. \n\nYou need better friends. You deserve a partner who will respect you. You deserve a partner who will put a future with you above drugs/alcohol. You deserve a partner who will not cheat on you or blame you if they cheat on you.", "He felt \"safe\" around the other chick. How'd that work out for ya, pal? You are definitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\n>  His family and all our mutual friends are calling me heartless and saying if he dies from an overdose, it\u2019ll be my fault.\n\nWelcome to a filtering event.  Anybody who blames you for breaking up with a cheater is somebody you can quite safely and happily cut contact with.\n\n> He wasn\u2019t under the influence when they slept together, he was still clean at that point.\n\nHe made a choice.  That choice was 'not you.'\n\n> I was heartbroken, and broke up with him immediately.\n\nGood.\n\n>  I cut off contact with him so he told his mom to tell me that he\u2019ll go to rehab if I give him another chance to make it right with me. \n\nWe do not negotiate with terrorists.  If he *chooses* to not go to rehab, that's his decision to make.\n\n\n\n\n>  Should I really sacrifice myself to him again so he can go to rehab?\n\nNo.\n\n> I don\u2019t think the responsibility of his sobriety should be on me \n\nCorrect.\n\n> but I\u2019m beginning to think I\u2019m being kind of unreasonable. \n\nNo.", "NTA - Anyone who puts the actions of your ex on you is an AH. Your ex is an AH. \n\nRemember this always: you own your thoughts and actions\u2026and that is it. No one else owns your thoughts and actions. You do not own the thoughts and actions of anyone else.", "NTA - Good for you for trying your best to be a good person in the previous situation. Addiction is the worst. And more good for you for leaving something unhealthy for you. You deserve more. None of this will ever be on you.", "::::screams in addictions nurse:::: YOU CAN'T WANT SOBRIETY ENOUGH FOR HIM. HE HAS TO WANT IT HIMSELF.\nDon't enable him. Don't set yourself on fire to keep him warm.\nNTA.", "This was what I told his mom. He went to rehab all those times for me, he didn\u2019t do it for himself. This would just be another time he goes for me. Her genius plan is for me to stay with him till he gets out of rehab and then to leave once he is sober. I get the feeling she would manipulate me into staying once he gets sober. And if she doesn\u2019t, isn\u2019t it obvious he\u2019d just relapse as soon as I leave? I think she\u2019s just heartbroken and isn\u2019t thinking things through so I\u2019m not sure how angry I can be at her to be honest."]}
