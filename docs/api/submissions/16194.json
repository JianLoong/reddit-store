When I met him, he had been sober for 2 years (alcohol and drugs, not sure if I can say the names of the drugs on here?) but had relapsed a year into our relationship. He\u2019s been in and out of rehab several times and I\u2019ve stood by him through it. I did everything I could to support him, and neglected myself and my needs to do so \n\nLast month, I got home from a work trip and he was nowhere to be found. He came home a day after and looked terrible. He broke down crying and apologising. I thought he was apologising for relapsing. I held him and allowed him to cry. After a few minutes, he said he had something important to tell me and that he was so sorry. Basically his ex girlfriend from before he met me, who he had introduced him to the drugs, was back in town a few months ago and she wanted to catch up. He said he didn\u2019t feel the pressure to be perfect around her because she has the same issues as him, and that he felt safe. He said he feels like a failure around me because I don\u2019t suffer from addiction, but it\u2019s different with her. Long story short, they slept together a few months ago and she\u2019s pregnant. He relapsed after she told him she was pregnant (1 month ago). He wasn\u2019t under the influence when they slept together, he was still clean at that point. \n\nI was heartbroken, and broke up with him immediately. He has been doing a lot worse since I broke up with him and his family are really worried. I cut off contact with him so he told his mom to tell me that he\u2019ll go to rehab if I give him another chance to make it right with me. I told his mom that there is no way I\u2019m getting back with him and being a step mom to the child he conceived while cheating on me. I\u2019m done and I\u2019m not going back. His family and all our mutual friends are calling me heartless and saying if he dies from an overdose, it\u2019ll be my fault. Realistically I know it won\u2019t be my fault but it\u2019s starting to get to me now. Should I really sacrifice myself to him again so he can go to rehab? I don\u2019t think the responsibility of his sobriety should be on me but I\u2019m beginning to think I\u2019m being kind of unreasonable.

His addiction is not your responsibility.

Do not listen to them. If they care so much about him they should get him into rehab.", "No! NTA! Not in the slightest! Anyone who tries to pin his addiction/relapse problems on you is either 1) overly emotional and not thinking straight, or 2) an enabler who is just trying to help him pin the blame on some external factor.  Also, if he's only willing to go to rehab if you'll take him back, he's only using it as a manipulation tactic. He won't actually do well in it since his goal wouldn't be to get clean - it's to get you back.", "Absolutely not! This is emotional manipulation that is being pulled on you. Whether he was on drugs or not at the time isn't the issue here. He cheated and got another woman pregnant.

It would have been understandable if you have left him on his first relapse, as you got into the relationship with the expectation of a drug-free man, yet you stuck with him after that; and at just one year of relationship at that.\n\nDon't feel guilty.
