After going back and forth for a while, we finally set our dates to go in the fall of this year. After we chose our dates, my mom informed me that she had invited two other members of our family along with her best friend and her adult daughter (Kelly and Stacy) to come on the trip with us. \n\nInitially, I was fine with this plan, although I was admittedly a little hurt because I wanted this to be a special time for us but I didn\u2019t say anything. My family\u2019s had a tough time this last year, so if inviting more people makes my mom happy, then fine. \n\nI went ahead and planned my travel and chose corresponding flights (connecting with mine) for my mom and anyone else leaving from her state. I\u2019m a very relaxed traveler, I\u2019m not big on tourist sites or itineraries, and typically like to make travel plans and then go with the flow once I get to the destination. \n\nLast night, we had a call to discuss the trip and I felt like Stacy was being a bit overbearing in the conversation, suggesting that others fly out of an airport closer to her state (makes no sense as most are on the US East Coast and she is more inland) and that we look into working with a travel agent overall. I\u2019m a frequent traveler and more than capable of planning a weekend in a city I\u2019ve visited before, but after this phone call, I just kind of see things a spiraling out of control. What was supposed to be a relaxing long weekend with my mom is quickly turning into an unwieldy group-trip tourism monstrosity with an itinerary that just doesn\u2019t feel very fun for me. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019m the only one who has booked a plane ticket, and I am planning to sit my mom down and tell her I\u2019ve changed my mind and no longer want to go on the trip with all these people. \n\nI\u2019m hoping that since it\u2019s so far away, people will be willing to pivot, perhaps to a trip closer to home at another time. I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings or my mom\u2019s relationship with Kelly, but I just am not willing to spend this amount of time and money planning a trip where I know there is high potential for me to not have a good time. Plus, I\u2019d admittedly just like to have the experience with just my mom and I. \n\nSo Reddit, WIBTA? \n \nTLDR; my mom invited a bunch of people on our dream vacation - I no longer want to go.", "created_utc": 1675670390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10v15sq/wibta_for_canceling_a_motherdaughter_vacation/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's enough already.", "I\u2019d cancel if you can\u2019t unload the other people. NTA. Omg can you imagine the time and stress just to pick a restaurant or outing to go to with all these people? And then Stacy being all pissed because she made reservations months ago at another place? Just no. Also I think your mom is a bit of an asshole for expanding the group unilaterally.", "NTA \n\nCan you imagine \u201cplease drive 1.5 days to an airport closer to me so we can fly together for 2 days in Paris\u201d\n\nLololololololol\n\nYou will be lined up for the Louvre for hours!\n\nSounds like a nightmare", "NTA.  This has just gotten out of control as Stacy has hi-jacked your trip.  This is not what you wanted to do at all, and it wasn't right of your mom to agree to have them along without checking with you first.  \n\nI read a post earlier today about how extra relatives had ruined an OP's trip with mom the last 3 years, and enough was enough!  \n\nYou've dreamed about this a long time, don't let it get ruined.", "Robert Downey's advice 'Smile, agree, then just do whatever the fuck you started out to do' \n\nIf your mom wants a group thing then wish her well. Let her know you're sorry about the mother-daughter trip not happening, and it's perfectly sensible to be honest about not wanting to join in on Stacey's trip.\n\nYour mom created the situation, so it seems fair to give her a chance to back out as well.", "NTA. \n\nJust tell everyone, you've booked these flights for yourself and your mum and you've booked this accommodation. Everyone else is responsible for their own flights and accom. (Obvs your mum will know about this prior, explain to her that you want to keep it stress free and prioritise her enjoyment). \n\nAsk your mum what things she wants to see, make an itinerary for HER. Then give it to everyone else. Be clear you've fulfilled your mum's dream, they are welcome to join or depart where they'd like. If people want to make it about them, go to them individually and explain the original plan for the trip was to fulfil your mum's dream. \n\nLike you said, it's only for a weekend. You will need a plan regardless to maximise your mum's pleasure.", "It seems like you and your mom have very different ideas about what this dream trip would entail- if you are intent on fulfilling your mom's lifelong vision, it seems that would include more people, whereas you want something more intimate. So the question you have to ask yourself is who is the trip really for? NAH yet, but you really need to talk to your mom and sooner rather than later...", "NTA. If your mom has a stable relationship with you she will understand how you feel. I\u2019d propose a counter offer that the two of you go alone and be honest about why you\u2019re feeling the way you are. Originally agreeing to plans and then having your feelings changed by someone who\u2019s showing overbearing and overwhelming tendencies, is not AH worthy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You shouldn't have your dream vacation ruined over someone else. You should speak to your mom about your feelings asap, and she needs to be on board with you standing firm with her friends. Make them understand that arrangements have already been made and if they would like to JOIN YOU, they need to adjust their expectations.", "NTA. Why did your mother invite others along without speaking to you first. Maybe I'm a bit too direct but I would have told her that's not happening.", "NTA. You will be a tour guide, travel assistant, overall helper for everyone and after the trip is finished, you will be the one to blame all the nuisances. Take your mom only with you and enjoy your trip! Paris is an interesting town!", "NTA. It sounds like Stacy is going to be insufferable on the trip and it\u2019s going to become a touristy sort of trip rather than a relaxing getaway. I would definitely drop out too.", "NTA. You need to communicate how you are feeling quite quickly before any plans become bookings. You need to speak with your mother though, a group trip is a totally different thing than a trip for two- is she a pushover whose friends jumped into the trip when she spoke about it or did she just not fancy spending the time with you?", "NTA", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t cancel.  Tell them they\u2019re welcome to come and do whatever they want but you will be spending 1:1 time with your mom.  Establish your boundaries now.  Have you asked your mom what she wants? Maybe she isn\u2019t into going with the flow either.  You need to find a middle-ground.", "NTA - Anyone inviting guests to any previously established 2-person event is TA. Your mom ruined this trip by rudely inviting people without even so much as a 'by your leave'. I would totally be hurt. I would let her know that you are allergic to group travel and you guys can go another time.", "YTA. Your mom\u2019s dream is to go to Paris. This trip is for her. If she wants all these people on the trip, then she should get what she wants. You and Stacey need to have a private chat to set expectations. But your mom shouldn\u2019t have to change her plans because you thought the trip was going to be the 2 of you. It\u2019s her trip.", "Who goes to Europe for a weekend trip from the US?
