Make them understand that arrangements have already been made and if they would like to JOIN YOU, they need to adjust their expectations.", "NTA. Why did your mother invite others along without speaking to you first. Maybe I'm a bit too direct but I would have told her that's not happening.", "NTA. You will be a tour guide, travel assistant, overall helper for everyone and after the trip is finished, you will be the one to blame all the nuisances. Take your mom only with you and enjoy your trip! Paris is an interesting town!", "NTA. It sounds like Stacy is going to be insufferable on the trip and it\u2019s going to become a touristy sort of trip rather than a relaxing getaway. I would definitely drop out too.", "NTA. You need to communicate how you are feeling quite quickly before any plans become bookings. You need to speak with your mother though, a group trip is a totally different thing than a trip for two- is she a pushover whose friends jumped into the trip when she spoke about it or did she just not fancy spending the time with you?", "NTA", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t cancel.  Tell them they\u2019re welcome to come and do whatever they want but you will be spending 1:1 time with your mom.  Establish your boundaries now.  Have you asked your mom what she wants? Maybe she isn\u2019t into going with the flow either.  You need to find a middle-ground.", "NTA - Anyone inviting guests to any previously established 2-person event is TA. Your mom ruined this trip by rudely inviting people without even so much as a 'by your leave'. I would totally be hurt. I would let her know that you are allergic to group travel and you guys can go another time.", "YTA. Your mom\u2019s dream is to go to Paris. This trip is for her. If she wants all these people on the trip, then she should get what she wants. You and Stacey need to have a private chat to set expectations.

Especially with a 72 year old?", "NTA.", "Not OP, if she has any sense.", "UPDATE! Thanks everyone for the advice. I decided to rip the bandaid off and talk to my mom. We talked this morning and she also expressed that the phone call stressed her out and she didn\u2019t anticipate Stacy\u2019s expectations and overbearing/controlling comments. \n\nShe felt terrible and told me that in her excitement she invited her friend out of kindness, thinking that they most likely would not go, and it\u2019s now got out of hand.

She\u2019s also going to tell them they\u2019re on their own for flights, hotel bookings, reservations etc. \n\nTBH, I hope they drop out once they realize I\u2019m not planning the trip for them. \n\nAnyway, y\u2019all are rad. Thanks so much!", "NTA but why don\u2019t you just worry about yours and your mom\u2019s flight, and let the other people worry about their itinerary. You just continue to plan your trip, let them deal with whatever they want to do and opt out if you don\u2019t want to join. \n\nIf your mom has never been to Paris, she may want to do those touristy things and at least she\u2019ll have someone to go with her. Maybe pick a restaurant or a museum you want to go to and ask if the two of you can do it alone.", "NTA. This is not what you signed up for and you have every right not go. However, I think your mum will be disappointed when she gets there anyway if Paris is her dream destination.", "Half of the problems on this sub wouldn\u2019t even be an issue if people just communicated and spoke what\u2019s on their minds.", "NTA.

Check out Amsterdam, the Hague, etc.... Then fly home via Amsterdam", "NTA, \n\ncancel the trip. and plan a surprise trip for you and your mom. just tell her to pack for a few days and just go.

Does she do this sort of thing often?\n\nI would either plan as if no one else is coming but mom or cancel all together. Seems like a big headache in the making.", "NTA. Tell your mom this is not what you were thinking and you will not go anymore. She can enjoy it with the people she invited.", "Agree. NAH.\n\nUse words! Tell her your feelings and concerns about this trip before it\u2019s out of control, OP. And then remember that this trip is for your mom, not you, and maybe you can suck some of it up to be there with her while she fulfills a lifelong dream.", "Then mom is welcome to go with her friends and she and her daughter can take a trip at another time.", "People who invite others on your vacation are extremely rude. NTA.", "NTA. Is it a possibility for your mother to do two different trips, one only with you and the other one with her friends?", "Your first mistake was agree to these new unauthorized terms.

It's now rude of her, to you again, to expect you to put up with this so that she doesn't have to fix her mistake, or 'look like the bad guy.'\n\nShe is spending your emotional capital to avoid having to spend her own, and it's incredibly rude, unfair, and selfish.", "I think that's a great idea! Especially regarding flights and accomodation. However, in my experience, some people will still push what they want to do on others, even if you agree beforehand that everyone can be independent (and still group up for certain things). Sometimes they have good intentions and don't want anyone to be left out. Maybe it's something about being in an unfamiliar place that makes people stick to their guns?", "Totally this.  If your mom's lifelong dream is to see the Mona Lisa, and you're thinking, \"Meh, overrated,\" it might still be worth it for you mom to be able to see it, and experience all of the craziness.\n\nAlso, if this is your mom's dream trip, a long weekend doesn't sound like much -- she'll basically get over any jetlag, see a couple sites, and go back.  That's a pretty quick trip.  As we get older, we also need a bit more down time (alas), giving her less time to soak it all in.  I wonder if perhaps you can join her for the start of the trip, give her the benefit of your experience, and then let her friends join her when you leave, so she gets more time there?", "NTA What is your mother thinking, inviting others on a trip which you had intended to go on together without asking you?", "NTA for cancelling but you are for not communicating. Your mum probably doesn't realise how important this is for you and if you'd told her in the first place, she'd most likely have been mortified that she had spoiled it by inviting others. The woman isn't psychic. Go and talk to her.", "NTA;  Your mother may have misjudged the situation or made an error in expanding invitation to Stacey and others.  Tell her NOW as it is already spiralling.  I have had a trip ruined in my own life that I spent a year savings for by events like this.", "YTA\n\nIt's a weekend.\n\nYou don't need to abide by everyone else but you don't need to bail if you're not in charge fully either.\n\nTell your mom you will take care of the two of you and others are welcome to join but you don't want to be dictated to by their preferences. Everyone should figure out what they care about doing and ppl can join or not according to their own preferences. \n\nBookmark like the Saturday dinner as a group event and then let it be pretty free.", "NTA\n\nCancel and tell your Mom that you'd really value a trip that's just the two of you together.", "NTA.
