They never got married, but they might as well be. I really don't remember my bio mom at all, and only barely remember anytime before my stepmom. My older brother (19M) remembers more and that's causing trouble for us.\n\nHe's never rude to our stepmom or anything, but he doesn't like her. I started calling her mom a year after I met her, he called her \"Ms.Lastname\" until he was like 12 and dad made him stop. He never gets her anything for her birthday or mothers day, and he never lets her tell him what to do. \n\nHe gets angry at me when I call her mom, or if I call her my mom to other people. I literally can't call her my mom when he's around or he'll interrupt me to say \"Stepmother\". He doesn't even call her that, he just calls her his dads girlfriend. He's even started to say weird stuff about how dad moved on so fast, and even called her a gold digger because he's 39 and she's 32.\n\nHe did it in front of his friends he had over the other week, and I told him to shut up. I said she might not be his mom but she's my mom, and he needs to grow up. He said I'm disrespecting our bio mom's memory, and that she'd be ashamed of me for calling another woman mom. He ended up saying he's not my brother anymore, and now he's moving out. He said he won't speak to me ever again unless I agree to stop calling her my mom.", "created_utc": 1685162463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sy4br/aita_for_telling_my_brother_to_stop_correcting_me/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's truly his choice. He has no say in how you feel about your mom. If he wants to move out, because you have different views, well that's also his choice. \n\nYou just keep enjoying the relationship you have with her.", "NTA\n\nAnd don't let him guilt you with that \"He said I'm disrespecting our bio mom's memory, and that she'd be ashamed of me for calling another woman mom.\" If your mom was any kind of good mom she would be so happy that you found another woman who loves you like a mother and took care of you and raised you into a great young man with a good head on your shoulders. Your mom would be PROUD of you for opening your heart to love another mom! She would never want you to be sad and unhappy, only mourning her for the rest of your life! Sounds like your brother needs to get some therapy.", "NTA. He\u2019s hurt but that doesn\u2019t mean you should have to change the respect you have for your mom (stepmom just to be clear). She chose to help take care of two children that weren\u2019t hers and one of them doesn\u2019t even respect her. Its a hard thing to deal with and to ask of someone. It\u2019s a good thing you call her mom and more importantly respect her as one. I\u2019m sure she appreciates it.", "I want to understand how are you the a-hole here?\n\nThis woman took care of you and you\u2019re brother.  Yes, he has the right to not call her his mom or look as her as one but she is to **you**.  Like this is something you\u2019re brother needs to face and you should not be guilt for having those feelings.\n\nNTA", "NAH - OP and their brother both have a different relationship with both of their parents. Sounds like older brother's anger has never been addressed in a healthy manner tho which is on Dad up till now. Now that brother is moving out hopefully they will take the time to heal.", "NTA. Brother is immature and sounds like he has a lot of unresolved feelings that he should talk to someone about.  He will speak to you again, he\u2019s just trying to get you to back down. Stay true to yourself, stay true to your feelings. If you can, try to explain that calling her mom is not a reflection of your nonchalance toward your bio mom, but instead a reflection of your love for your stepmom.", "NTA. You're allowed to call your stepmother whatever you want. Is she good to you and treats you like a mother should? If yes than why shouldn't you call her mom? That means she's doing right by you and I'm sure that's what your biological mother would have wanted - someone to love and care for you in her stead.\n\nIt seems that your brother carries unresolved trauma over your mother's death, especially since he's older and retains memories of her. I think speaking to a professional would help him towards healing. His anger towards you, especially if your stepmom is not the devil he paints her out to be, is totally unjustified. The ultimatum he made was wrong and honestly if he goes through with it, with the amount of bitterness and resentment that he seems to have, that distance with him would probably be better for you both mentally and emotionally.", "NTA, you call her whatever you wish. He doesn't have to call her mom.", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry your going through that but if he\u2019s rejecting you and your family there\u2019s not much you can do. He sounds like an angry teen but even if he\u2019s older than I think he might come around someday. Until then though, don\u2019t change your relationships to accommodate one angry unbending person", "NTA your brother's behaviour is terrible. It is understandable that he is grieving for your loss, but it is not acceptable to be rude or mean to other people. Your brother needs therapy so that this doesn't ruin his life. It is bigger than just his behaviour towards his stepmother and it will come and bite him a hundred times if he doesn't learn to cope.", "You are definitely NTA ! \n\nHowever, your brother should understand the sacrifices she made to be your \"mom\"\n\nStepparents don't get enough credit. I'm sure your dad misses your mom immensely but due to life, she couldn't be here to raise you two. That IS NOT anyone's fault! Your mom would have wanted you to have been loved, taken care of, and healthy\n..and if your dad's GF did that for you two then HE is disrespectful to your mother's memory. \n\nCall her mom if that's how you feel. If your brother has an issue he needs to find out why he feels that way. It's nobody's fault, but he has to realize that Dad/you did not betray Mom in any way since ALL of you deserve love and happiness. Hopefully, Bro comes to his senses. \n\nStepparents take on a hell of a role. They CHOSE to love a child that is not theirs biologically and only a special person can do that. \n\nNTA OP. Definitely NTA. \nThank her for loving you and call her mom all you want. Your bio mom does not disagree. Bio mom wants you to be taken care of\n\nPeriod.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
