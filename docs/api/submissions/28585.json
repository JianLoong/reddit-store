Sur left when Little One, who is now 5, was just a month old but she hadn't really been involved much over the course of that month anyway. Her parents disapproved of her having a child out of wedlock, plus she claimed that she just wasn't cut out to be a parent and that her mental health was majorly suffering from it all. I met my husband when Little One was around 6 months old, we moved in together a few months later, and we got married when he was 4.\n\nMy partner and I had many conversations about her over the years. He had mixed feelings about her for the longest time. She gave him the greatest gift he's ever received, but she willingly chose not to be in his life. On top of that, she made things infinitely harder for my partner \u2014 he had to live with his brother for a while because trying to juggle finishing university, job hunting, and keeping a roof over his head all as a single parent isn't something anyone could ever do without support.\n\nThere have also been plenty of conversations between Husband and our son, especially after his brother was conceived via surrogacy. We explained, in age appropriate terms, that his mom was kind of like our surrogate in that she gave us him when we couldn't have a baby ourselves.\n\nRecently, though, my husband's feelings on Sur have shifted entirely to the negative side of the spectrum. She reached out to him and asked if they could meet up. He agreed, we all went out to lunch, and it didn't go well. We thought she would just want to see photos and maybe hear how our son was doing, but that wasn't the case. She expressed interest in seeing him again in person and we shut that down immediately. \n\nMy husband told her that we would continue conversations on our son's comfort and knowledge level, and that if he ever expressed interest in meeting her one day when he was older then that was up to him. But as of right now, it would just be confusing. This woman is a stranger to him. She replied that he was *her* son before he was ever mine and that she had much more right to him than me. This is the point at which I said she was basically nothing more than an egg donor and that insulting me wasn't going to take away her failures as a mother. She left in tears.\n\nI've told this story to a few friends and they've all been on my side but said I might've been a little harsh.

It doesn't sound like she signed away her rights. And it sounds like your husband has had conflicted, empathetic feelings towards why she couldn't take responsibility for Little One at all. \n\nI'm sorry, but this is not your fight and what you said what cruel and unnecessary. YTA for this remark but NTA for fiercely loving your family. \n\nI get that you want to be protective of your family, but it also appears that Sur is trying to build something going forward, while she feels (rightfully) ashamed. She sounds broken. But she's also still the person Little One will have a relationship their whole life, even if that relationship is in absentia. I dunno. Maybe you and your husband can talk about what would make you both feel safe and/or what Sur might have to do to prove she's worthy of an additional conversation. Or maybe you could talk to a family therapist who focuses on these exact kinds of issues. Or maybe you can reach out to people who were the Little One in families much like yours and try to understand what they did/didn't want from the parents who raised them. My general understanding is the sooner Little One knows there is a real person who is the egg donor and Daddy actually loved her, the more integrated Little One will be as a whole and loved person. I could be wrong.", "ESH\n\nSur sucks most by far, because she walked out of her son's life at 1 month old. That's crazy. BUT: in her defense, I see 2 big reasons that could have contributed to her behavior: did she have post partum depression? and was she sensing that her partner and baby daddy (your now husband) was gay or bi? both of these things do not excuse her from walking out of her kid's life at all, but I feel like you may be leaving out information about that situation.\n\nBut you and your husband also suck. Your son is only 5. If his bio mom wants to have a relationship with him now, who are you to take that away from him? They should be allowed to build a relationship even if it is inconvenient for you. imho it is never a good idea to keep away bio parents from a child, unless they are abusive. I have no information here that she would be abusive. Yes she sucked for walking out of his life. Can you please provide more info on her reasons for wanting to be back in his life now? Were there major life changes for her?", "NTA\nShe gave up the chance to be a mother when she left. She doesn't get to come back and say she's his mom... She's a stranger, not a mother. She hasn't been there for any of his milestones, sickness, or anything...\n\nShe's trying now, but the way she's going about it is wrong. You don't claim you want to jump right back into where you left and insult the person who's been raising the child this entire time while you've been absent.\n\nShe deserves to be reminded that she chose this path of life. If she wants to make it right, she has ways to do that. Did she sign away her rights? If not, she could come at him from a legal perspective where she gets court ordered visitation and things can go south from there.\n\nBut I'd let her try to start having a bit of a relationship with her son, because in the end she did birth him. Make it a slow and steady process, don't just drop him in her lap right away.", "I do understand why you said what you said. But there is a lot we don't know about HER or what her struggles were at the time. \n\nI also need to let you know-as someone who found out later in life that her dad was not her dad-that biology matters way more than most of us care to admit. Y'all need to tread carefully here. Little One may at some point when he or she is older want to reach out. They may be angry. And that anger could go ANY direction, including towards you. \n\nConsult a lawyer, and depending on what they say, consult a therapist for your child either now or in the coming years, hopefully before puberty. Trust me on this.", "YTA.  Mommy was not a surrogate. She had a baby with a man who quickly found his true life 6 months after she left- PPD probably. And now you want to lie about her being  a surrogate.   Liar. Don\u2019t do it because that it\u2019s the the truth. May she find a good attorney and reinforce her maternal rights. Where is your surrogacy contract?", "Nta she was in tears bc she felt bad and guilty. Bc she abandoned her kid.  That's something one *should* feel bad and guilty about.\n\nGranted, your husband doesn't get extra good person points for taking care of his own child. He had sex with her. He impregnated her.  It's not like she did it alone.\n\nIf kiddo decides he wants to meet her when he's older, it's great that you'll support that.  But he's a kid, not a doll she can put on a shelf and ignore for 5 years, then pick up like nothing has changed.", "NTA. She abandoned her child practically at birth and was absent for five years. Morally, yeah, she\u2019s basically the surrogate. But double and triple-check the legal situation, which among other things will depend on your jurisdiction. If she has zero rights , no realistic prospect of getting them and you and your partner are fully in control, then IMO the burden of proof is on her for it being in the best interest of the child for them to have contact now (the child can make his own decisions about it when he\u2019s older) - among other things, will she just waltz back out just as she tried to waltz back in? She\u2019s already abandoned him once, and past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. Also, where was she all these years? And why now, what\u2019s changed? \n\nIf, however she could plausibly be awarded rights by the system, then you need to contact a lawyer asap and establish what\u2019s legally the safest course.", "YTA. 5 is still young enough to have a meaningful mother and son relationship. If I found out my dad wanted to be back in my life at 5 and my mom said no, i would be furious with her. This is about what is best for your child, not you. If she's serious about being ready to be a mother, it is your sons right to know her. If she's serious and goes to court, the court will most likely put a parenting plan in place for her to reenter his life whether you like it or not.", "YTA for the way you spoke to her. You have no real idea what she went through. You didn't have to be that mean. She was more than a surrogate.", "So many of these comments trying to excuse a deadbeat who abandoned her child just because she\u2019s a woman. She doesn\u2019t get to come back into his life because after 5 years she started to feel guilty. NTA", "Soft NTA but imagine your son finding out you took the choice of meeting his biological mother away from him when he was 5.", "NTA if she wanted a relationship with your son she should have stuck around enough to be in his life even if it was just once a week or something, she ABANDONED him and when you abandon someone you have no right to see them without their consent and your son is way too young and his mind is too fragile for him to meet her right now, it will be super confusing when he thinks she was a surrogate and by the sounds of it she will probably plant the wrong seeds in his mind and he might view you as the bad man who took him away from his mom. He deserves better and I love that you\u2019re sticking up for him. If she wants to try to mend her relationship with him then she should consider compromising with you two and maybe start by sending gifts during holidays and letters that you guys can read to him so that he can slowly over time learn who she is and he can meet her in person when he\u2019s comfortable and whenever that may be if def suggest doing strictly supervised visits until he\u2019s much older. Best of luck OP I really hope it all works out for you guys!\n\nEdit cause I accidentally called you a bad mom instead of bad man I think I got confused since I was about to type mom a few words later", "NTA\n\nLet's observe the math, shall we? Your sons bio-mom was present for all of 1 month of that childs life. At five years he is sixty months old, and of those months she existed for **one.** Put differently she can call claim to 1.67% of his total months lived in this life, during which she was barely present anyways so that's really presence = <=1.67%. Meanwhile, you entered in at around 6 months of age and were actively present within his household within a few months of that so give or take a few months your presence is equal to or less than 90%. \n\nYou've been there since his very first year of life and were present for a ludicrous amount of milestones, including theoretically his first words. His bio-mom wasn't. She was elsewhere, tending to herself, or living her best forever 21 experience while providing exactly nothing. \n\nFrom what it sounds like, she didn't even pay child support. She's a deadbeat at best, an egg donor at worst, and she has a mighty bit of gall trying to lean in to her status as \"mother\" and slur your involvement when you were there to teach this boy how to walk, talk, and read. Parenthood is not something you can dip out on and return on a whim, and it's ludicrously entitled to think otherwise.\n\nYou weren't too harsh, you just spoke the honest to god truth. You told her how she looked trying to approach now and waving her title about. She needed to hear that, to know that she wasn't going to get to have it her way every time.", "NTA as you have said that her rights were terminated. Legally, she doesn't have any right to see the child, and seeing the child without psychiatric support could cause damage.", "She gets to tell you that \u201che was my son before yours \u201c yea for 10 months and you left a month after he was out of you !!!

I'm a woman and I'm for having **a mother AND a father** but what she can't expect to disappear then come back as she wishes, she failed as a parent, miserably.\n\nThat being said, that little one will grow up and he might ask about her. In this case, you'll have to **let him be** and not create obstacles for him. if he doesn't ask after her, good for you.", "NTA\n\nSurrogate is pretty accurate. The big difference is that she doesn't feel, herself, like a surrogate. She is going to feel the pain of a loss that shouldn't have happened and that she cannot reverse.\n\nI am trying to imagine being a mom but then having no experience actually mothering your kid. What a mind fck. Weird calling yourself a parent when you haven't been through all of it. There is no way for her to even have perspective on all the hard parenting stuff she didn't have to go through. Maybe the reality check is a step in the right direction", "YTA and so is your husband. No she was not like a surrogate. \n\nIt is her son, and you and your husband should be finding out what has changed that she reached out, for instance severe postpartum depression and cause women to feel nothing for their babies, and abandon them.

Her parents disapproved of her having a child out of wedlock, plus she claimed that she just wasn't cut out to be a parent and that her mental health was majorly suffering from it all.

I don't blame OP for wanting that risk. \n\nAnd even if they did it would require lawyers to hammer out arrangements and hopefully court ordered therapy to try ensure that the kid isn't mentally scarred.", "Which we don't know and that was the point of my post.", "Cool story, still a dead beat.", "This is not true in most states if OP is in the US.", "You insinuate she gave up parental rights BUT don\u2019t say it outright. So what is it?", "You\u2019re dancing around and not being clear. Were her parental rights terminated by a judge? Did you legally adopt the boy, or do you have any kind of legal custody? If you\u2019re just his dad\u2019s wife, you\u2019re not in the strong position you seem to think you occupy. There needs to have been pen put to paper by a judge, magistrate, or other legal official, not a notary public, stripping Sur of parental rights, and then granting you parental rights.", "You want a child you claim to love to grow up thinking that his mom didn't want him?\n\nYou're being extremely selfish.  Its not about what \"rights\" everyone has over the child, its about what is in his best interest.  If his mom is sober, stable, ready, etc...then you are basically trying to keep someone from loving your child.\n\nBeing a step-parent sucks, espevially in your situation.   Its not fair that you deal with the bullshit, while the bio parent gets loved undeservedly.  But that's your role.  If you do it right your son will know who raised him and be better off for it, but right now you are SUPER fucking this all up.\n\nPlease stop making this about yourself, and be glad that someone you love now has another person who will *hopefully* love him just as much.", "Hopefully you will see that YTA. More love for your child is better. Mother matter. And you behaved abominably in all of this. Sounds like you rubbed your hands with glee when she lost her sanity with PPD. Embraced the love of your life, and now post on Reddit to get favour from strangers. Trust me - the world will see you for what you are. And dishonest. Opportunistic and heartless. Oh well, reality is not Reddit.  And lying to children usually results in something you say you don\u2019t deserve. But children hate liars.", "If she wanted to be a mama she would have been. As an adult who was abandoned multiple times by her mother I hope to god this kid never meets her and just believes he was a surrogate baby. It is worth so much more to know your parents loved you than to wonder why they didn\u2019t.", "Dictionary.com\n\nSimile.\n\nFigure it out.", "Hmm. Not falling for his sob story. Nope.", "It\u2019s Reddit.  People make up stuff. Lots of holes here.", "You have no idea what she was going through. If she had severe PPD she may have thought she was a danger to the kid. That's just one option This isn't a question about if she should be allowed back or if she was right to leave because for sure she shouldn't have just ghosted her kid like that. This question is solely about if it's too harsh to call her an egg donor.", "Yeah", "I'm happy you were able to white knuckle through your mental health issues. I would hope one thing you'd learned is you can't compare people's struggles.", "The kid has already been impacted by abandonment and attachment when she left in the first place.  Let\u2019s try potentially prevent the identity issues that he could face not being allowed to have a relationship with his \u2018 mother\u2019.\n\n it\u2019s not straightforward, ultimately the only opinion that matters is the kid\u2019s opinion. Who has potentially been manipulated into thinking his mother is like a surrogate and doesn\u2019t matter , or/and hasn\u2019t been asked about his feelings at all. \n\nOP needs to be open and honest with their kid.", "Honestly yeah.. this dude is AH. They're lying, omitting facts.. very purposefully making the mother to be a bad person. I said NAh to give them the benefit of a doubt and comment in good faith... \n\nThis is will be fake because I bet the OP will come into the comments and conveniently say she gave up her parental rights instead of just saying so in the main story. Either way what he's doing is wrong but a judge will give the mum visitation no matter what unless there was a history of abuse etc..\n\nEDIT called it. OP conveniently said she gave up her parental rights \ud83d\ude44", "Correct in Alabama where my in laws lived they terminated rights of my youngest BILs bio dad and was adopted by FIL.", "Sure, she could have. But op can\u2019t adopt the son without her having already done it or him filing for a step parent adoption, where she would have the opportunity to argue against it. It\u2019s likely that he\u2019d get to adopt anyway given how long she\u2019s been out of the boys life. I\u2019m just saying unless she terminated, she has rights until she doesn\u2019t", "Yeah\u2026 My dad didn\u2019t pay CS or buy us things or even remember to ring on our birthdays\u2026 I guess I\u2019m hoping these kids might have had it better.", "It\u2019s actually true in most states. Some such as California will consider it abandonment and terminate rights after 6 months while others like Oklahoma and Texas the time is two years before abandonment. She disappeared with no contact for 6 years. I guarantee she\u2019s more than passed the time limit for abandonment.", "I\u2019m a man, just to clarify. \n\nI have legally adopted our son, her parental rights were terminated. The comment you\u2019re replying to was me talking about if she tried to get her rights reinstated.", "OP is male. It says so in the first line of the post.", "Oh yes. Her absence will be undone for sure,she just needs to come - and 5 years living without a mother go right into the window. LO won't be confused, won't ask why his mom loves them now, what he did to make her come back, what they need to make her stay, what they need to do to deserve her love. Totally agree,she needs to be introduced immediately. Their future therapist will be overjoyed.", "a mother who never was in the picture isn't more love to the kid. it's the mother making right for her ego not the child. fuck that. OP has been more than a parental unit, blood means nothing when you don't show up.", "The world sees him for what he is, a father protecting his child from someone who has demonstrated they can not be trusted not to hurt his child again.", "He\u2019s leaving lots out. This isn\u2019t the whole story.", "No. I\u2019m on Reddit. This isn\u2019t my thesis", "It's definitely about more than name calling.\n\nAlso, I don't care about what she was or was not going through. She abandoned her child. Other people have raised that child. Those people and their opinions matter more than the slip shod mommy dearest. \n\nI guess a lot of people choose to live their lives revolving around what people are or aren't feeling, I guess that's a way of living, I think it's awful. A fruitless if not meaningless way of getting through life. I judge people on what they DO. Like, abandoning their baby at a month old.", "We are not responsible for our mental health issues but we are responsible for taking care of them. Instead of seeking help, she left. She does not get to just walk back in that child's life like she didn't abandon them.\n\nEta, I didn't white knuckle anything. I asked for help.", "Abandonment typically only applied when enforced. So if bio dad never initiated that process legally, they won't terminate rights now that bio mom is back in the picture. Also, because it's a court process, the courts would have notified bio mom of the case and give her the option to appear.", "Abandonment doesn\u2019t always mean termination of rights.", "Then you are fully protected as she is now legally no longer a parent. \n\nWith that said, I would caution the complete prevention of her interacting with your son. If the bio mom can prove she will stick around, is willing to put in the effort to be another reliable adult, and can follow your family\u2019s rules, I think you should slowly introduce your son to her. You are right that she is a stranger and not a parent, she cannot expect to be treated as anything else. But more family to love him and as he gets older he\u2019ll have questions. Definitely follow a professional\u2019s help, but if you block her completely and your son discovers this when he\u2019s older this could cause resentment or hurt. As the choice was taken away before he even knew their was an option. \n\nHowever, if she can\u2019t show that she will be a dependable figure in your son\u2019s life then she should not have any interactions until he\u2019s older and has more maturity to understand it\u2019s not him but her. Being abandoned twice (or more) is devastating.", "OP you should add the legal situation in your post!\n\nI\u2019d go with NTA, harsh, yes but also true: she gave birth and disappeared for 5 years, im guessing she also relinquished her parental rights or did not fight for it, since you say her rights were terminated. \nIf she was a man she\u2019d be called a sperm donor! \nThe distinction between surrogate and \u201cjust the egg donor\u201d needs to be made though, completely different situations. \nGood luck!", "Meh. Says you.", "Are you referring to OP? OP is a man", "No. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t.  That\u2019s not what he is. That\u2019s his Reddit personae.", "Or it is. Lots of mothers take off. Why are you willing to give her the benefit of the doubt?", "This question was only about op name calling. Her specific question was \"was I too harsh\" \n\nNobody is debating if she should have left. You keep arguing wether she was right or okay for leaving. No is disagreeing with you about that.", "What if she tried to find help and couldn't? What if it's taken her these five years to find the right help?", "If she had no money and no support, how would you expect her to be capable of taking care of her mental health issues?", "Fixed, thanks!", "Because his story is a mess.", "You keep bringing up points you introduced and claiming I'm arguing about them. I think they call that gaslighting now adays. 'I didn't say that but you did' Well, I didn't get hung up on the egg donor or her feelings. I just casually implied I didn't think she had any parental rights. You're welcome to reread the thread, I have. I've also decided to exit thread. \n\nFor what it's worth, I was only interested in your perspective because of how you worded your reply. Wasn't trolling. But this is not a meeting of minds.", "If she tried to find help, she would not have left entirely or at the very least disappeared completely. Mental health issues doesnt me no communication", "What part?"]}
