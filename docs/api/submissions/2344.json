They are meant to protect from cars that mistakenly drive into the area. Especially in low light because skate parks can look similar to a parking lot. The bollards are close to one another to allow for people in the space to be protected, should a vehicle slam into the bollards. I suspect they were exclusively on the side facing the road, as they most often are. If so, this means there are other places you could\u2019ve gotten into the skate park, I\u2019ve actually never seen one that was entirely surrounded by the bollards. \n\nYou were mad because you think bypassing a safety feature mainly used to protect children is a \u201cright?\u201d Well that\u2019s some take. Then you further put, again, mainly kids, at risk by shutting down the whole park, because you know where they will skate. Sideways, streets, actual parking lots, where they will be placed at risk. All of this for a space that you do not use but \u201cthink you\u2019d like to try some time.\u201d You kicked up all this fuss about your \u201crights.\u201d Yeah dude, you\u2019re a massive asshole.

Its likely you also couldn't fit well on a swing, or down a slide on a playground. And yeah, that's meant for kids, but generally it's kids and teens who use the skateparks. So you can't claim that all public equipment should be accessible to people of all sizes when playgrounds, playground equipment, and even park benches aren't made for all body types.

People need to know the truth of their realities. Same way that smokers NEED to know that smoking will shorten their lives and make them more likely to have certain medical issues, people who live with weight issues (not just obesity or overweight, but similarly people who are underweight or have eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia) need to know what the risks are so that they can make sure to check on things like their blood pressure, their sugar levels, maybe get a sleep test done and use a CPAP if needed, etc. You don\u2019t have to lose weight to be healthy, but if you do not take steps to mitigate risk you\u2019re just lying to yourself that you\u2019re a healthy obese person.", "YTA\n\nAlso, YTK", "Do you skateboard?", "Yes, YTA.

It doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s fair. *What matters is what you can make possible for you.* A lot of time, we have to create allowances *for ourselves* and it\u2019s worth it, because of the personal growth we achieve when overcoming obstacles.", "I agree with that, I just don't think there's any single piece of equipment that people of every age and physical ability can use. So a range of equipment that has options for different levels of mobility serves the community best.", "LOL you already admitted you don't even know if there was an entrance to the park you COULD HAVE fit through.\n\nYTA now go learn how to skate.", "YTA That is a you issue change your situation. All you did was ruin the summer and cost tax payers money. I don't with people fat shaming but at the same time you choose to be ignorant. People are pissed and will be for a long while.", "How tall/wide are the bollards? I'm picturing 3 ft pillars? Could they have just removed one of them to make a super wide gap?\nAlso why cant you shimmy your way over them? Or use a different entrance? Not every entrance to a public facility needs to be accessible as long as there is an option available. You fucked up a good time for a lot of people for something you don't even do yet so why would you expect anything short of malice. It'd be different if you had made an effort to get involved in the activity and getting to know the others before ruining possibly the one place these teens/kids have access to skating. Seems like YTA", "So you've never even been in the skate park, yet you threw a fit and had it shut down because you disagree with basic safety features? YTA isn't strong enough, but I don't want to get banned by saying what I really want to say. You suck , walk your dog somewhere else.", "If you\u2019re in the US, this is not true and that would be illegal. Every space, including homes, is required to have at least two exits completely independent of each other. Most parks have far more. Stop. You keep changing your story. \u201cI did it on principle!\u201d \u201cI mean, I want to skateboard!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t see if there were other entrances!\u201d \u201cIt was the closest entrance to my apartment!\u201d \n\nJust stop. It\u2019s one small area of a larger park. It was for a specific activity, not for you to walk your dog. If you walked your dog there with any regularity you would know the entrances around the park, if you were going to skateboard you would already be learning and you would\u2019ve discovered this issue when you attempted to use the park. Bollards are almost exclusively used in areas next to the road and no where else in a given space. Your story is untrue for the most part. You expected everyone to treat you like a hero, in your local area and on reddit, and you\u2019re surprised everyone is mad that you ruined a place for skateboarders with your entitlement. Go advocate for your own spaces and pursue your own hobbies instead of tearing down others because you have a chip on your shoulder.", "Really? You went through all this trouble to complain without looking for **another entrance**? We\u2019re not talking about Grand Canyon National Park here. I\u2019ve never seen a skate park so big that checking the perimeter for entrances would be impossible. As in, usually you can just *see* the other side. \n\nThe other thing that bothers me is that you did this while we\u2019re all still suffering from worker shortages, supply shortages, etc. due to the global panini. It was pretty much guaranteed that the project was going to take a long time and have delays.\n\nAll that said, I do feel bad that you were spoken to that way. But that\u2019s not what you asked to be judged on, so YTA.", "You could've just used the same entrance everyone else uses because entrances don't usually have bollards. Like someone else said in another reply, one of the functions of bollards is to prevent collisions, so it's likely that that's not the (only) entrance. I've been to many parks and have never seen one completely surrounded by bollars.", "She absolutely deserves to be called names.", "\u201cFYI there is no such thing as an unhealthy weight\u201d \ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\ud83e\udd13\n\nI\u2019m serious, if you really want to learn to skateboard don\u2019t start with the ramps.

There are so many health risks and diseases that are exacerbated by *besity it's not even funny. Total knee and hip replacements are virtually all people with an original BMI of 40+. (I say originally because many doctors require you to lose weight before you can get a total joint replacement.)\n\nIf you want to argue that any weight can be beautiful I will definitely give you that.

Fucking. Shit.\n\nThere is absolutely such a thing as an unhealthy weight.\n\nYou have no interest in skateboarding and won't admit it for some reason.\n\nYTA for what you did to the skatepark AND for the horseshit you're pulling here.", "there are unhealthy weights on both ends of the spectrum. Imagine telling someone obviously starving to dealth they're at a healthy weight. this is a bad take on human health.   \nI taught action sports professionally for years. They are inherently dangerous. especially if you push above your ability like by going straight to ramps when you don't know how to skate.  You need to learn how to skate on flat ground, then get used to accelerating on slopes before you get into a skate park. If your body is too wide to pass through the entrance of the park the inevitable crashes that happen when learning to skate will mess you up bad. \n\nYTA. your neighbors hate you because you made an issue over your access to equipment you lack the skills and physical fitness to use. No one is benefiting from the change you pushed on the community.", "Oh, child\u2026 There is no such thing as a \u201ccorrect\u201d weight that applies to everyone, but that does not mean that it is healthy to be overweight (or underweight). People die because of unhealthy weight and the health complications that come with those conditions ALL THE TIME.  It\u2019s OK to be body-positive, but it\u2019s not OK to ignore medical science. No doctor will EVER tell you that there are no health implications for being overweight.", "lol incorrect", "My dear,you\u2019re just lying to yourself at this point", "If you start to resemble a skeleton, I'd say you are at an unhealthy weight.", "The question here isn\u2019t whether the skate park should be more accessible (of course it should) - it is whether OP\u2019s decision to complain about it (and the resulting consequences) was an asshole move. \n\nIf OP doesn\u2019t intend to use the park (and doesn\u2019t in fact use it), then she\u2019s the asshole for making an issue of this - it is an entitled, wasteful request she made \u201cjust because,\u201d and has significant costs for others.", "I mean on here, this sub. A few people have given you some advice. Skateboarding is far more athletic than simply standing on a board and rolling down a ramp. It takes balance and strength and stamina. Take baby steps or you\u2019re going to end up flat on your ass/back. so heed the advice or find yourself a good orthopedist that you can have on speed dial. Your choice.", "I mean, they may be rude 11 year olds, but they do have more experience than you.", "I think one of the sad parts here is that if you DO want to learn to skate, those kids could have been a great help to you. Just this weekend I saw a few kids at the local skate park teaching another kid how to drop in on the small half pipe there. Chances are if you are serious about learning and put in the effort some of them might have helped you and offered advice. \n\nBut not after closing down the park because there wasn\u2019t an entrance on the side you wanted one on.", "Those 11-year olds knew how to use the Ramps, and you can\u2019t even stand up on a skateboard.
