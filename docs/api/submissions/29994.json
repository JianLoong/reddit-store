Last time John stayed over he slept in our guest room but the entire next morning wanted to nap on our couch making me very uncomfortable because he put his feet on my throw pillows and spread the contents of his backpack all over my house. John also insists we drive him to a skytrain station (about 40 minutes away) rather than dropping him off at his parents house when it is time to go home, he has never offered to pay for gas and refuses to get a car even though he has the money.

Does your husband sleep over his friend\u2019s house like he\u2019s a teen? Some people have a hard time with the transition from teen to adult and his friend is definitely proving that theory.   \nTell your husband how you feel, tell him you\u2019ll take all the blame for stopping the overnight visits, they can meet up at a pub for a couple hours next time or he can go there, but what you\u2019re describing is just gross.", "ugh yikes.

I think his friend is too comfortable in our home and I have now told my husband his friend is not allowed to spend the night anymore and he\u2019ll have to drive his friend to his parents house.", "His friend is unfortunately stuck with transitioning to adulthood and thinks staying the night is normal because he does not drive and public transit does not run in our area so he cannot get back to his home without someone driving him or waiting until Monday morning for the train. He does this to other friends too, I\u2019ve recently found out one of our mutual friends will not let him stay over anymore. My husband spent the night once at his friends apartment and told me it was so messy he felt uncomfortable the entire time. My husband agreed the overnight visits need to end when he saw all the cleaning I was doing the next day, he didn\u2019t realize it was more than normal because he usually runs errands and grocery shops while I clean the house", "I have told John if he doesn\u2019t clean up after himself anything left behind will be going in the trash, it\u2019s a rule I have with all friends lol I\u2019m not keeping someone\u2019s dirty socks for the next time they come over.

Yeah he\u2019s just nasty and should be on better behavior as a guest.", "At 29 he is not \u201ctransitioning to adulthood.\u201d He is an adult with rude behavior.", "Thats awesome.", "Ah dang. Yeah that's just him fucking up then."]}
