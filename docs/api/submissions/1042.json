Your daughter certainly had more to lose by this prank, but this is a consequence of her actions.  You were fair (even punished the son a bit harsher since he did it after you said not to).  Hopefully, it'll be a lesson learned for her.", "NTA. Your daughter is learning a valuable lesson that pranks that hurt people aren't funny. Your son got punished the same as she did. She should learn to do unto others as you want done unto you.", "NTA.  You are the parents, your daughter doesn't get to set the punishment. Doing what she wants would set a very bad precedent.", "NTA. Each of them did the same \"crime\" and got punished for it.

Perhaps they feel they are being treated unfairly in other circumstances,  or misinterpret favoritism, or one has been known for bullying the other and it has not been delt with so it is being delt with in your child's own way. \n\nWhat they did to eachother is very extreme.", "nta\n\nShe shouldn't dish it out id she can't take it", "NTA.

Simple as that. \n\n\nIn a court -\nYou dispensed justice.\nHe dispensed revenge.\nShe dispensed assault for a laugh. \nVery different things. Hers is worse. \nIn fact, if she pushes it, I would tell her that if anything, his punishment should be less. \n\n\nHappens all the time in the courts. Someone assaults someone. They get assaulted back. The person who did it first goes to jail. The other person gets a warning. Both pay a fine. You gave them the fine, haircut and car keys. But the sons revenge wouldn't have happened if she hadn't assaulted him first.", "NTA - I can understand your daughters pov but she started this, she is older and should be more mature. Equal punishment could be based on emotional damage but how do you judge something like this. This is a good example of FAFO.", "NTA. Although I don\u2019t condone it, she\u2019ll learn more from having it done to her than losing phone and car privileges. The length of hair is irrelevant. Pranks that harm another person are seriously uncool.", "NTA. Had not done the original prank, this wouldn't have happened. Yes this is simple way to look at it, but it's the truth. Basically, she FAFO.", "Why did they both need buzz cuts? Your daughter couldn\u2019t have done an undercut and saved some of her hair?\n\nI guess it\u2019s fair. But I don\u2019t even understand how this happened. Like who wouldn\u2019t wake if their hair was being trimmed?", "NTA. They both assaulted one another, in the same fashion, and received similar punishments.\n\nHowever, you have deeper problems here. Your children hate one another, or at the very least, have no respect for one another. I hope you can find a way to remedy this.", "It was worse for your daughter, but she started it. What concerns me more is that your son completely ignored you and went ahead and did it anyway. That would have been the biggest punishment for me.", "NTA.\n\nReasonable punishments.  She is the kid and doesn't get to decide the punishments.\n\nMaybe she'll remember this if she has her own kids.", "NTA - I wonder why she thinks his crime is greater? He wouldn't have done what he did at all, if she hadn't started it. Don't start nothing,  won't be nothing.", "NTA, son got a longer punishment for pulling the same prank when told not to.

I\u2019m NOT saying you\u2019re a bad parent, but I think it\u2019s past time to sit with your kids and have a lesson on empathy and what is and is not appropriate in terms of pranks as well as the meaning of consent (as in under you should not touch another person without their consent, which obviously includes cutting someone\u2019s hair)", "Definitely NTA!!!", "Nta this is what happens when they take in what people.aee doing on videos and think they can get away with it.

Your punishment is absolutely fair.", "NTA, same crime same punishment with no special treatment except your son getting a slightly longer punishment because he was told not to retaliate. To use a Reddit favorite both your kids \u201cplayed stupid games and won stupid prizes\u201d. I would love to hear more of your daughter\u2019s reasoning for why her brother doing it to her was worse yet it was \u201chilarious\u201d when she did it to him. She could dish it out but couldn\u2019t take it. Hair will grow back and maybe she\u2019ll think twice before doing it again.\n\nConsidering the \u201cprank\u201d sounds like your daughter got the idea from social media. I\u2019ve read more than one story in this sub about someone pulling this \u201cprank\u201d and I\u2019ve seen it go wrong plenty of times online. If that is where your daughter got the idea then like so many others she failed to realize for a lot of those videos everyone is in on it and everything is scripted. Those \u201cprank\u201d videos are already ridiculous but it\u2019s worse that they inspire others to do it too and they don\u2019t realize it\u2019s not real. \n\nI don\u2019t think any of this one instance is indicative of your kids \u201chating each other\u201d. If this cycle of \u201cpranking\u201d and retaliating continues or if stuff like this had happened multiple times before than yeah you need to intervene. But if this is a one off talk to your kids about thinking a bit more before doing a \u201cprank\u201d and that retaliating isn\u2019t ok.", "Nta she fucked around and found out.  It's not such a funny prank when it happens to her, now is it.", "NTA.  And have a sit-down with the boy.  What did he *think* was gonna happen?", "NTA. This is funny.", "Nta", "NTA. 16 is a good age to learn the classic \"fuck around and find out\" lesson.", "NTA I had a brother and I knew full well he would get me back if I did anything like that to him. I\u2019m betting your daughter knew that too. I\u2019m also betting he thinks it was worth it. She\u2019s learning a lesson about being a sister right now. Equal punishments from you is fair.", "YTA, not for the punishments you gave out, but for how your kids are acting \n\n\nWhat is wrong with you and your partner (if you have one) that your kids are acting out like this? I grew up with two brothers and a sister, and while we did prank each other, nothing was this extreme. You need to sit both of them down and tell them this stuff isn't ok and punishing them is not enough to get that message across. \n\n\nNo offense OP, but based on this post, you seem like a bad parent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were right to come down on him harder because I think he was aware, a anyone would be, that it would be far more consequential for her too get a buzz cut and because he retaliated after you had already handled it, and that was particularly defiant to you, while her actions had nothing to do with you, really.  Might have gone further, but you made a decision and I respect that. If you go back or go further on that decision, neither one of them will respect you for it, even if it\u2019s in one of their favors.

Or rather it should be, but your daughter seem to be behind there if she thinks these sort of actions are funny.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t blame your son for giving her a taste of her own medicine. And it should be noted that she apparently doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good joke any more, imagine that.\n\nAlso hairdressers generally charge much more for female hair than male, so your son probably had to pay more for her hairdo than she did his.", "NTA.

Equal punishment. Hopefully lessons learned for both of them.", "NTA same punishment is fair, your daughter doesn\u2019t get a say on what the punishment is. Your daughters length of hair argument shouldn\u2019t impact punishment, if anything i think it counts against her as her hair was obviously very important to her and she still did this to your son. Your daughter is older should be more mature and was also the instigator in this. As there was a few weeks between incidents, maybe you son has had a hard time at school or from his sister.

Particularly teenagers?", "It is a relatively harmless prank initially. You see it all the time on social media. Kids follow what they see online. I don't think this is enough to state they're \"bad parents\".

You can be an A+ parent or a F parent and kids are still going to do stuff like this. They are kids. Kids do stupid stuff which is how they learn to not make the same mistake down the road.

I think OP handled this correctly and hopefully both kids she learned a lesson.
