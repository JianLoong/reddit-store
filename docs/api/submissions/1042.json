I chewed it enough to get it soft and then put it in my sister\u2019s hair right at the nape of her neck and swirled and swirled until she noticed. They ended up having to cut her hair in a long pixie cut because they couldn\u2019t save it any other way. My mom beat my ass so bad I couldn\u2019t think straight.

Admittedly, I've seen other assholes like her say that, \"women's hair is worth more\" as a reason not to retaliate in kind, but I've always found that to be something of a hypocritical stance at best.\n\nEitherway, I do think you're NTA in this situation. Yes, you should punish your son, and I guess because he was already told no that he deserves the harsher end of it. However, he doesn't deserve \"worse\" just because your daughter dislikes her new hairstyle. She did a shitty thing and paid a shitty price.

If she didn't want to risk it, she should have considered that before starting everything.\n\nGiving your son a slightly harsher punishment because he chose to make his move even after your daughter had already been punished is also fair - he had obviously decided the equivalent punishment was an acceptable price, so the punishment should be increased in response to ensure it has the correct effect.\n\nThey do both need to be told that this ends now though - both made their move, both drew blood and there it ends. Leave the situation alone and I can see your daughter wanting more revenge, which will justify a response from your son and so on...

Kids!", "Braving the downvotes to say I\u2019m stunned at these responses. If it takes years to repair the damage, the penalty should be higher. The son\u2019s hair will be back to normal in a few months. The daughter\u2019s hair will likely take years to reach its old length. (This is also probably why the daughter mistakenly thought her prank wasn\u2019t a big deal; the son, on the other hand, knew exactly what a big deal it was.)

I don't think you punished your son equally at all, and not for the reasons your daughter stated. Hear me out. Your daughter did it she had to pay for the appointment, had her phone taken away and her car keys for a month. That's 3 things to punish her. Your son only had to pay for her appointment and had his phone taken away yes it was for longer but you said that was because he did it when you told him not to, not because that was how long she was missing her phone. You want to have equal pushishment for the same crime...where is his third punishment? Did you take away his video games or computer or ground him?? She had 3 punishments and had her hair shaved off where is his third? You want to call it equal...its not. And for that YTA.", "NTA, but it definitely says something that your son knew the punishment and did it anyway. This clearly wasn't a strong enough deterrent. Also, I think it's worth acknowledging to your daughter that this is a lot harder on her than it is on him. People are rarely cruel to a boy with a buzzcut, but they definitely are to a girl.
