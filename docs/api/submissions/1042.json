Either way both should be punished equally and make sure they understand retaliation is not acceptable.", "I think the punishment isn't equal. The fact that he chose to do it knowing the punishment meant he decided it was worth it, which means the punishment wasn't harsh enough. You also took away the phone for longer but I see no equivalent for the car keys. Both of them did something wrong but he also directly disobeyed you and already knew the punishment. A good option in my opinion would be to up the punishment, and do so again if there's additional retaliation.\n\nAnd she's kind of right: while someone with short hair doesn't necessarily care less about their hair, she will suffer the consequences far longer and more harshly due to the way society treats women and girls. And she's only in high school. Her hair may not be back in time for her senior photos, depending on the length. His will.\n\nI'd also like to know if you forced them both to get buzz cuts? I think that's an infringement of bodily autonomy for either, but worse if he's happy or okay with a buzzcut and she's upset and had other options. The punishment can't just be literally equal but should have a similar impact. I can't see that being the case here: his hair was shorter and he knew the punishment up front. They both did wrong but he came out of it having lost less.\n\nFor example: if two people commit the same crime, but one person is rich and the other poor, is it fair to give them the same amount in bail?

In Ancient Rome women sold their tresses to make rope. Long hair really is \u201cworth\u201d more than short hair. \n\nFurthermore, even though shaving a strip of hair off is the same ACTION (assault), the EFFECT is different because the consequences of having a buzz cut are very different for men and women. The man just has a different style of hair, whereas the woman might be seen as a weirdo or ugly (not saying this is how it SHOULD be, just how it IS for the majority of people).
