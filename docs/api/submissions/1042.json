Can you imagine millennials or Gen x doing something like that. It\u2019s not that they didn\u2019t think of that, but we didn\u2019t see that kind of behavior get rewarded with thumbs ups and supportive comments. Peer pressure is now online strangers. The Jiminy crickets that will say \u201cthat\u2019s not funny\u201d are down voting so much they aren\u2019t heard.", "They're teenagers going through rebel years is all.", "It's a great opportunity to discuss the idea of mutually assured destruction. If they both decide to go down that road, things will not work out in their favor.", "Thats because he can't drive though? If he could I imagine they would take his keys away as well.", "/u/Emergeongoofg is a comment-stealing bot.

Maybe now she'll think twice before she \"pranks\" her brother again.", "When I was 8 and my sister was 10, she got nail polish on the couch because she was painting her nails there instead of the table. My mom saw it, my sister blamed me. I tried to tell my mom my sister has her nails painted that color and I didn\u2019t and every other explanation I could think of. Didn\u2019t matter and my mom beat my ass. Afterwards, my sister came clean about being the one to do it and everyone just moved on. I have to note we are Hispanic. My sister and I both have long, thick, dark brown hair. A few months after the nail polish incident I got my hands on three pieces of bubble gum. I chewed it enough to get it soft and then put it in my sister\u2019s hair right at the nape of her neck and swirled and swirled until she noticed. They ended up having to cut her hair in a long pixie cut because they couldn\u2019t save it any other way. My mom beat my ass so bad I couldn\u2019t think straight. It\u2019s been nearly 30 years since the incident and I still say \u201cWorth it!\u201d \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0f", "My teens never assaulted one another or acted like this.", "Boys might care as much, but unless he had long hair he isn\u2019t going to take as long to grow it out, is he", "MAD only works if neither party is willing to face the consequences. Teenagers are *PRECISELY* the type to cut off their nose to spite their face. If one figures out they can bomb their own social life to shut down the other's, it's going to be much more of a tactic than a deterrent", "You\u2019ve probably never seen TikTok", "I've only recently gotten to a point where I like my curly hair and how it looks after years of not knowing what to do with it. If one of my siblings shaved part of my head, resulting in me having to get a buzz cut I'd be extremely upset. Luckily my siblings aren't as big of jerks as OP's kids"]}
