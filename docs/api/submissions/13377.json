Things have been rocky at times. He was widowed, it will be 4 years in a few months. We met a few days after the 2 year mark of his wife's passing. This was his 2nd wife, she was very good for him. Changed his ways, made him a better person. I am thankful for her, because without her I would not have found him. He says I was sent to him by God and his wife that passed. He had prayed to send him someone. That he was ready. 2 days later he meets me.\n\nI was at my heaviest at that point in my life. I am tall so i carried it pretty well but i had gone thru a divorce, covid quarantine wasn't good to me, many things. I have since lost 54 pounds and have about 30 more to be at my healthy happy weight. I walk regularly now. In a better headspace, working on being better for myself over anyone else.\n\nToday I had left for my walk. I forgot my work phone and was still technically on the clock a few more mins so I went back to grab it. I had been gone about 10 mins maybe. I get back and go in to my office to get my phone and overhear him in the hallway area, house echos, telling a family member that I had gone to my walk because i was trying to lose the weight because you know he just can't put up with fat the rest of his life. The person on the phone was like oh stop. Somwthing along those lines and I walked out without saying anything but it just ate me up so I went home early.\n\nI confronted him about how it hurt my feelings that he would even say such a thing especially to his family but apparently it's not the first time. He contradicts himself so much I don't know if he really does say this to his family regularly or if he just tells me that to make me feel like they feel the same and agree to try to motivate. But it does the opposite to me. \n\nHe does say inappropriate things to me at times about my weight and i remind him that he fell in love with me heavier than this and it doesn't happen overnight. I could go and get a quick fix but in order to fix your body you have to fix your mind and him body shaming me is only going to stall me. \n\nHe said I shouldn't have even told him that I heard it. That I should have iust kept it to myself because if he wanted me to hear it he would have told me himself. Which he has before. So, AITA for bringing it up? Something that hurt my feelings and he didn't even say sorry or apologize or anything. We aren't talking this evening and he's in bed now in the other room so here I am feeling like the asshole for starting a fight that could have been avoided.", "created_utc": 1679972846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/124ao0l/aita_for_overhearing_my_boyfriend_call_me_fat_and/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or was he more sensitive / diplomatic?\n\nWhat was your reaction to him thinking it was ok to tell you that. \n\nMy partner made a comment about my weight in our early months together. I was a bit overweight for my height / for my adult average at that point (but spoiler alert: not as much as I\u2019d get during lockdown / other issues around the same time!). \n\nI told him he didn\u2019t get to say things like that AND continue to see me naked + enjoy me being comfortable doing naked-y things with him. He had to pick one. So he chose not saying rude things. \n\nHe had to work quite hard on himself, because he was pretty judgemental about many things when we first got together. But he got himself in the right headspace eventually that focussing on \u201cI would like a long & healthy life with you, while we do enjoyable activities that need a certain default level of fitness / being able to get off the sofa\u201d was the way to be. \n\nIt did help that for me I had an injury that limited my activity so he has had to accept the slow pace of improvement in both my ability to Do Fun Activities and lose the weight (still not lost - I managed half when my injury improved but now I\u2019ve plateaued & am in denial!). I don\u2019t know how well he would have adapted if it was just \u201cugh she\u2019s lazy & has no excuse for not losing the weight - well, only her poor mental health\u201d.

He absolutely gets to decide if he finds me attractive or not. \n\nBut he also does get to decide if he is willing to accept me as I am - flaws & all - rather than as a conditional \u201cproject\u201d that he\u2019ll maybe fully accept once I improve certain features for him. \n\nAnd I get to choose whether I\u2019m willing to live being told I\u2019m \u201ctoo flawed to approve\u201d by the person who is meant to love & support me. \n\nYou do too.", ">This was his 2nd wife, she was very good for him.

He just told you he will talk bad about you to whomever he wants and you have to be fine with it bc he wasn't talking to you. This is not about your weight. As soon you got the weight off he will find other things he can complain to others about you. \n\nYou can do an experiment: walk in on him and pretend to be on the phone and complain about him talking bad about you with his friends/family and some other stuff and watch his reaction.
