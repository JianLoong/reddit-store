The pandemic must have been rough for that kid.", "I definitely do not think that ytah for calling because it seems like you are truly and genuinely concerned and if he is being abused, then thank God that you did call.  I can tell you that having raised four boys that all went through a phase of entitlement and laziness, and being completely disrespectful that I could understand why the dad took the actions that he did. I have made my kids walk home before and told them they better not get a ride or they would be an even more trouble. I also locked a couple boys out of the house because their  hormonal rages were so out of this planet. The phases varied with each one but it sucked for a while. my boys were always on great behavior with anybody else but the second they looked at me they we\u2019re a totally different person. One of them made me out to be such a horrendous evil abuser at the school called CPS on me and of course I was cleared immediately. I never laid a hand on them but at that age they think that being expected to do their chores and homework all in one day is abuse. I went through all of it with them. Luckily with the help of a therapist and their physicians to make sure that their physical and mental health was not the cause of their psychotic meltdowns, they grew out of it and they talk about how they don\u2019t know how I put up with them. We can laugh today. From the outside looking in it looks terrible and I cussed out a neighbor before from the frustration of the moment. It is really tough to live through that and not actually murder them.  I know that this may seem totally inappropriate but our boys coaches always helped the boys when they needed someone to talk to and they didn\u2019t think that they could talk to us. In my opinion, the coaches were a total lifeline for our family during those phases. I am pretty sure that if you reached out to the coaches and told them that he\u2019s your neighbor and you think he might need a little bit extra moral support that they would atleast listen to you and not be upset for going to them. If the kid isn\u2019t seeing the school psychologist, then they might refer him there and that was always helpful for the boys at school. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, but in my opinion at that age, it takes a lot of love, patience, support that one parent can\u2019t always give because it is overwhelming. Don\u2019t tell the Dad you\u2019re going to the coaches and let the coaches know that they don\u2019t need to inform you of anything you\u2019re just putting it out there. \nYou sound like a really caring and kind person. Thank you for that.", "NTA. You are potentially saving that boy kid from a horribly abusive situation.", "No you\u2019re absolutely NTA. That kid needed help!

CPS does not give a shit about older children, and you would likely make things a lot worse for the child by getting them involved. Confiding in a teacher that I was being severely abused at home was one of the worst mistakes of my life because he called CPS, which led to me getting physically and sexually tortured in foster care. There are SO MANY people who have likewise by victimized by the foster system. When I complained to my caseworker, she set up a meeting in which she made me apologize to my foster parents. Eventually I begged to go back to my original parents and endured daily severe physical abuse because it was still many times preferable to the foster system. The entire CPS system is evil to the core. I am still incredibly traumatized.", "Definitely definitely DEFINITELY NTA! This kid is being abused and we have no idea to what extent. You did the right thing by reporting it and I think it would be right to call CPS and keep reporting it. It is possible you could save this kids life, his dad sounds like he can\u2019t control his anger and even the best of people can snap under pressure and do unspeakable things. You\u2019re wonderful for being a safe person for this kid and for seeing the warning signs. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.

Or maybe dad just needs some kind of help. CPS has a lot of services, and foster care is only one of them.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of CPS (someone called them on my sister maliciously, repeatedly), but they aren't evil.

As an example, I had my arm burned over the stovetop because I came home from a friend's house wearing makeup (I'm female). My father called me a a slut and burned me. \n\nThe teacher called CPS. That led to me going into the foster system where I was physically and sexually tortured. When I told the caseworker, she set up a meeting in which she made me apologize to my foster parents. Eventually I begged to go back to my original parents and endured almost daily abuse from them because it was the better of two evils. Although I'm not sure, I think my foster parents continued to get children sent to them. After all I wasn't their first placement. \n\nI suffer crippling PTSD from my experience. As a result, unless it's a case as bad as Elisabeth Fritzl, I would never ever call CPS on an abused child.", "THANK YOU for saying this. I'm getting downvoted for sharing my experience of getting physically and sexually tortured in foster care. When I complained to my caseworker, she arranged a meeting in which she forced me to apologize to my foster parents. Eventually I begged to go back to my original parents and deal with their severe abuse because it was still so much better than the alternative.\n\nI would NEVER EVER call CPS on an abused child unless it was an Elisabeth Fritzl type situation.", "Or maybe they were physically and sexually tortured in the foster system like I was. As a result, unless it's a case as bad as Elisabeth Fritzl, I would NEVER EVER call CPS.", "The problem with reporting child abuse is that the children often get abused even worse in the foster system.

You aren\u2019t offering any alternative here.", "Also, you aren't \"splitting up a family,\" you are facilitating that authorities to separate a vulnerable child from his abuser.

Definitely call CPS as well. Start keeping a record of when you hear yelling/crying from their apartment, when you see Ryan locked out of the apartment, etc. Ask your local PD or CPS office what the proper procedure is for this data to be admissible in court (i.e. calling the police non-emergency line, or calling a CPS caseworker so that there is a paper trail). There are still ways for you to be a safe adult for Ryan even if his dad won't let him interact with you.", "You could call CPS and say that the child is locked outside of the house, made to walk in the rain, cried, and the father constantly yells at him.

Just saying.", "The problem here though is that the father told OP not to talk to Ryan anymore. Talking to OP is likely getting Ryan abused even more. Im glad you had someone you could talk to but at this point it seems like any attempts at reaching out to OP is getting Ryan abused. I\u2019m going to realistic here, if OP offered a place to stay for Ryan, his dad would likely physically harm OP or report him to the police for kidnapping. Making getting help from the government less likely. I really think CPS is the only option here.", "Yeah but he's being abused already.  So I don't see your point.  \n\nIm sorry that happened to you, the system obviously has problems.  But what do you expect op to do?  Sit and let this kid be abused while she knows its going on?", "As a pediatric nurse & also a victim of a crime, sadly it does fall thru the cracks. The cop involved in my case failed to turn over video evidence to the DAs office but I was able to provide it. So doesn\u2019t hurt to give CPS a call just in case.", "That's a good point. I missed that. In that case, it may be best to either try to find a way to communicate with Ryan without his father knowing, or, sadly, treat it as a lost cause. \n\nAs it stands, I see two outcomes. The first, more likely, is that CPS will not do anything because Ryan is a 15 year old boy, and teenage boys are the lowest priority for them. What will happen is that Ryan's father will be angry at having been reported to CPS and take revenge on him.\n\nThe second outcome is that Ryan enters the system and endures even greater trauma like I did. From what I gather from speaking to other ex-fosters, most of us are traumatized by our time in the system.\n\nI'm just trying to be realistic from someone who actually has experience as an abused child in the system. I see a shitload of people here who are either very naive or have a savior complex.", "Yeah honestly this is just a very sad situation all around. The system is so broken. I hope to foster teenagers at some point in my life. Not to be a second parent- never that. But to provide a safe space to emotionally grow, develop those important life skills that so many kids in the system miss out on. Many families in the system I feel like adopt or foster to fill a hole in their family, when that\u2019s not the point of it at all."]}
