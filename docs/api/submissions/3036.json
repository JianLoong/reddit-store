I can tell you that having raised four boys that all went through a phase of entitlement and laziness, and being completely disrespectful that I could understand why the dad took the actions that he did. I have made my kids walk home before and told them they better not get a ride or they would be an even more trouble. I also locked a couple boys out of the house because their  hormonal rages were so out of this planet. The phases varied with each one but it sucked for a while. my boys were always on great behavior with anybody else but the second they looked at me they we\u2019re a totally different person. One of them made me out to be such a horrendous evil abuser at the school called CPS on me and of course I was cleared immediately. I never laid a hand on them but at that age they think that being expected to do their chores and homework all in one day is abuse. I went through all of it with them. Luckily with the help of a therapist and their physicians to make sure that their physical and mental health was not the cause of their psychotic meltdowns, they grew out of it and they talk about how they don\u2019t know how I put up with them. We can laugh today. From the outside looking in it looks terrible and I cussed out a neighbor before from the frustration of the moment. It is really tough to live through that and not actually murder them.  I know that this may seem totally inappropriate but our boys coaches always helped the boys when they needed someone to talk to and they didn\u2019t think that they could talk to us. In my opinion, the coaches were a total lifeline for our family during those phases. I am pretty sure that if you reached out to the coaches and told them that he\u2019s your neighbor and you think he might need a little bit extra moral support that they would atleast listen to you and not be upset for going to them. If the kid isn\u2019t seeing the school psychologist, then they might refer him there and that was always helpful for the boys at school. I know a lot of people will disagree with me, but in my opinion at that age, it takes a lot of love, patience, support that one parent can\u2019t always give because it is overwhelming. Don\u2019t tell the Dad you\u2019re going to the coaches and let the coaches know that they don\u2019t need to inform you of anything you\u2019re just putting it out there. \nYou sound like a really caring and kind person.

I reconnected her with her old school counselor who was in the right position to help her. She never would have even thought to reach out to that counselor because it's still hard for her to ask for help. But she was so thankful for it. The adults who've known her are so happy to give her support. She amazes us - she has persevered through so much and kept her eye on her academic goals and is a kind and responsible young lady.

I am definitely not a fan of calling CPS over everything because like you said a lot of times the kids do end up in worse situations. It\u2019s insane how people who can\u2019t afford to feed their children (but are still loving parents\u2026 just down on their luck financially) can get their children snatched from them just for the state to pay a foster home to take care of those kids instead of the state giving that money to the actual parents, who besides being poor are otherwise perfectly loving people who would never abuse their children. I do, however find it hard to not do something for an abused child to try to get them out of the situation because in all honesty, there\u2019s no real way of knowing whether or not a situation is as severe as Elisabeth Fritzl, unless someone is called in to investigate. Sometimes the abuse is so much worse than we can imagine behind closed doors. I\u2019m sure the people who knew Elizabeth in real life didn\u2019t think that her life was the way it was when she went home. I definitely don\u2019t think that every little thing grants a CPS call, but I also don\u2019t think that people should just stand idly by due to fear of a child being placed in a worse situation. Because there are plenty of children out here who have been taken into foster care and have had amazing experiences. It really is a double edged sword and an awful situation all around.", "I mean, you\u2019re preaching to the choir here.

I get it. \n\nDoesn\u2019t mean OP shouldn\u2019t try though. Also it\u2019s not guaranteed the kid would go into foster. There could be grandparents, extended family, etc. Documentation could help for custody in family court. \n\nNot to mention just the psychological effect for the kid. Knowing that SOMEONE is trying to help. Again, as someone who has come from a bad sitch, it\u2019s devastating to think you\u2019re absolutely alone and nobody is trying to advocate for you.", "> I'm getting downvoted for sharing my experience of getting physically and sexually tortured in foster care.\n\nYou're being downvoted for acting like it's going to happen for every kid.", "Ideally the police have already called but you calling as the actual witness is even more helpful to them.", "NTA You did the right thing.", "NTA. \n\nJumping on this comment to point out a painful possibility- too often abuse like this goes on unnoticed until it is too late.

For this family, that is good!", "This comment", "> It's possible that your friends are just young and naive, people who come from healthy, well adjusted families can't imagine what it is like to suffer like Ryan.\n\nIn my experience, it is the people who come from healthy, well adjusted families who are the least hesitant to call CPS when they perceive abuse. They have an idealistic version of CPS saving abused children from suffering. \n\nI was severely abused by my parents and even more severely abused in foster care. I am in a support group of foster care survivors, and most of us are EXTREMELY hesitant to call CPS on abused children. We have a more realistic view of what happens when CPS gets involved.", "NTA You have reason to suspect there is child abuse occurring in that house.", "This.

The first, more likely, is that CPS will not do anything because Ryan is a 15 year old boy, and teenage boys are the lowest priority for them. What will happen is that Ryan's father will be angry at having been reported to CPS and take revenge on him.\n\nThe second outcome is that Ryan enters the system and endures even greater trauma like I did. From what I gather from speaking to other ex-fosters, most of us are traumatized by our time in the system.\n\nI'm just trying to be realistic from someone who actually has experience as an abused child in the system.", "In my situation, my extended family turned on me and protected my parents when I was removed. I suppose it might be because my parents protected them when one of them sexually abused me. My situation was SEVERELY abusive, yet it was still paradise compared to foster care.\n\nAfter I returned to my parents (I begged my caseworker to let me go back), I had an extremely supportive teacher. I will forever for letting me cry and vent to her the mornings after yet another night sleeping in a park because I was scared for my life at home and who forgave me when I copped an attitude in class because I had so much anger at being abused for doing the most trivial things.\n\nLooking back, she probably broke the law by not reporting it, but she knew what had happened to me in foster care, so she knew that it would be more dangerous for me to return to the system, so she kept quiet when I asked her to, and I am so thankful. I still talk to her regularly.", "Good one! Document everything. Dates and times included.", "This!", "Maybe not, but I need to bring some realistic balance to a discussion that is very tilted toward calling CPS. I suspect that few if any of the people advocating to call CPS are ex-fosters.

There are certainly wonderful foster parents, so I've heard. But if you enjoy physically or sexually abusing children, or simply enjoy playing the role of a slave master, there are few easier ways than to become a foster parent. You'll even get paid to do it. \n\nIf you are a good person, please considering becoming a foster parent. There are far too many bad ones, and they keep getting placements because there aren't enough good foster parents, so they send kids to whoever is available."]}
