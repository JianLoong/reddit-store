I took him home but we sat in my car for a while until it was the time that he was due to get home. I told my friends and they told me not to get involved but I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head. \n\nI left it for a while until Ryan knocked on my door and asked me to look after some things for him and that he was scared. He wouldn\u2019t tell me why he was scared. His dad came home and saw us talking and got really angry. He told me not to talk to Ryan again and pushed Ryan into their apartment.

Call CPS when they open and if he locks him out again call the cops.", "NTA - former social worker here, and while you never know exactly what's going on behind closed doors I think there's enough evidence here to warrant investigation.\n\nI'd recommend calling CPS over the police because the police aren't as equipped equipped to handle this as child services: however I don't think you were wrong for calling the police if that's the option you knew of. Calling CPS now would be a good idea though.\n\nAs to your friends, ask them this...if you started treating them they way you've described this father acting, would they want to maintain the friendship? Or would they start thinking about \"splitting up\"?", "NTA\nYou have reason to suspect there is child abuse occurring in that house.", "NTA. This child is being abused. You had a moral obligation to call. You have heard shouting and crying and witnessed a teenager walking home in the rain, afraid to take a ride because he\u2019s afraid of his father\u2019s reaction.

Ryan needs help badly and you may be the only one that is looking out for him. That's amazing. As others have said, please contact CPS.", "NTA that child is being abused and you did the right thing. Youre such a sweet person for checking on him and giving him rides home. I hope Ryan is doing okay. Thats just so heartbreaking to hear.", "NTA, a hero instead. You likely saved this kid\u2019s life. Thank you for getting involved and caring about those who cannot protect themselves.", "NTA. Ryan is scared of his dad and is being abused by him.  You did not split up a family - this is all on the dad who is the major AH.  Good on you!!", "NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. You would've been the asshole if you hadn't done anything. What you did is the only responsible thing.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  Something is wrong in that house and the police need to sort it out.   You didn't break up a family, the father is responsible for how he cares for his son.   This is all on him.", "NTA at all. It sounds like there I'd something bad going on and maybe your call will help Ryan.", "NTA NTA NTA. ALL DAY LONG NTA.\nI can't tell you how much I wished my neighbors had intervened. They once called the cops after my ex chased our kid around the neighborhood screaming at her. The cop did nothing, even let him blame her for the altercation. But there were years before that when we were together & I was trying to figure out how to escape when cops should have been called. Once we got to divorce court, all I could do was say he was abusive & describe it. There was no paper trail of evidence. His lawyer even asked why cops weren't called if it was as bad as I claimed. (I was terrified & neighbors didn't want to get involved.)\n\nCall the cops every time you hear screaming. \nCall CPS.\nTell the kid to come to you for a safe place.\nHelp him get emancipated so he can get away without more trouble.\n\nHis father is actively hurting him, & he's trapped.

Lots of people have teenagers, lots of people have to get on their teen\u2019s cases, but those who can be heard shouting into the night or locking them out of the house are very few.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t have sat by and done nothing. That father may have severe anger issues", "NTA, but I\u2019m not gonna lie unless I see bruises, hints at sexual abuse, human trafficking, other weird shit going on.. I mind my business. The reason being because as shitty as their life may be inside the home they are in now, foster care can very often be a lot worse. A lot of children go from the frying pan into the fire. I would feel like crap if I called the police or CPS/DHR on a family and then a few months/years later I hear about that same kid being hurt in a foster home. I\u2019ve worked within foster care for a private company and it\u2019s very difficult to find foster parents they are normal people and aren\u2019t in it for the money. As a private company they has much much HIGHER Standards than the foster parents directly recruited by CPS/DHR\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Several times I showed an empty apartment there was a 15 year old boy sleeping there because his dad kicked him out. But I leased the apartment anyway so it didn\u2019t scare anyone off. I did not call anyone because it was 1987.
