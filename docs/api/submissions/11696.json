{"id": 11696, "submission_id": "11ko130", "title": "WIBTA if I confronted my bf's roommate that I saw him pleasuring himself?", "selftext": "Yep. It's exactly what it is. For context, I'm (19f) a freshman college student, and I'm still living in a dorm because of the law. On the weekends, I like to spend the weekend over at my bf's (19m) dorm, and he shares this small room with his roommate (19m), so privacy is a very difficult thing to achieve. \n\nWell, yesterday morning (Sunday morning) my bf's roommate was up a little earlier than me and my bf, because he has to work in a couple of hours. He's usually not too disruptive, but I woke up to check on the time and see if the roommate is still there. Well, I opened my eyes for a good second and I saw him going at it. I saw everything. He wasn't covering himself or anything like that. I'm surprised I didn't scream. So, I quickly laid back down and had my covers over my head. My bf was still asleep, but I was fully awake now. I wanted to throw up and cry. It wasn't really something I wanted to see at all. \n\nAs I was still awake, he was still going at it, because I could hear the noises he was making. I was very uncomfortable, but I didn't know what to do. So, I just laid there and waited for him to finish. Luckily, he did his business shortly and got ready for work. \n\nAfter he left the room, I quickly got up. My bf woke up, and he could already tell something was up. He asked what was up, but I was very hesitant, because I didn't want to gross him out. Well, he assured me that it will be all ok, so I told him, and he was not happy. He was visibly upset. He asked me if he should talk with the roommate about it, but I said no, because I feared the roommate would be upset at me for invading his privacy. My bf understood, but he said that he will talk to the roommate about it if it happens again. \n\nSo, my issue now is that ever since the incident, I feel very different and uncomfortable whenever I'm around the roommate. He's going to live with us in a couple of months when we all move out of our dorms. So, should I talk with my bf's roommate about it? Will I be the bad guy if I did? I'm happy to hear any advice.\n\nEdit: I come over to my bf's dorm every weekend, because he loves spending time with me, and the roommate is very cool with it. Besides, it gives me a place to sleep, because my roommate likes to bring her bf over the weekends, but I don't know them at all (we don't have anything in common) and we hardly stay in the same room over the weekdays because of school. I completely understand that I'm not entitled to my bf's dorm.\n\nEdit #2: I should really mention that another reason why I spend the weekend at my bf's is because he prefers it that way. It's not just me not liking my dorm. My dorm is a female-only dorm, and my bf is uncomfortable with the idea of staying at my place, and it's simply because he's scared of being accused of something he didn't do. So, (with the permission of his roommate) I stay over at my bf's dorm just about every weekend.", "created_utc": 1678160433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ko130/wibta_if_i_confronted_my_bfs_roommate_that_i_saw/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I told my bf not to worry about talking to the roommate about it, because I don't want to cause any conflicts, especially since we'll all be living together soon. \n2. The roommate is very strict when it comes to his privacy, so I felt like I was invading his privacy.

Perhaps this is actually a situation that is best left to your partner to handle. His words will have far more weight, given that they\u2019re the ones sharing the room right now while you\u2019re just an overnight guest. He can say, \u201cBro, we saw you flogging the sea serpent this Sunday morning and I really don\u2019t appreciate you doing that while we\u2019re literally right next to you.\u201d Hopefully that\u2019ll suppress his urges.

I personally would never do that and I think it was very inappropriate for him to do that with you both so close by. I get it's his room but like if you can't wait maybe use a bathroom? Sexual acts in shared spaces is super weird to me. I would say have your boyfriend talk to him especially if your boyfriend is uncomfortable with that as well and that you mentioned you were a welcomed guest and he knew you were there.", "No you shouldn't. As you mentioned, space is pretty tight in your BFs dorm and his roomie was probably just used to your BFs sleep schedule. You had an awkward encounter but there's absolutely no reason to embarrass the roomie and make things forever awkward between you both for a long time just because you saw him masturbating.", "INFO: Did this roommate have any say about your spending the night in his room, or is your overnight presence routinely forced on him without his permission?", "I mean, you are in his house.  It doesn't seem to me like he thought you were aware of what he was doing, so I have my doubts that he was trying to make you feel some sort of way.  Just be civil to the guy.  He didn't hurt you.  He wasn't creeping on you.  Masturbation happens and young men often do it several times a day.

This is regarding the original post before any edits", "There's a couple issues here that I think need addressing seperatly. \n\nYou would NOT be an asshole to address this issue. It's inappropriate to be doing that with other people in the room unless they are ok with it. Now with that said, since you are staying with your BF, be careful that you and him have not had any fun while the roommate is sleeping. I'm not saying you have, and I'm not saying you would, but just be careful to avoid hypocrisy. \n\nThe other issue I think that needs addressing is you staying there every weekend. Has your BF and his roommate had an honest and open conversation about if he's ok with that? Since you mention limited privacy, it sounds like your BF's roommate is having to give up being comfortable in his dorm/apartment every weekend to accommodate having you stay over. \n\nI am not saying that justifies what he did, but I think that there needs to be a conversation if he's really ok with you being there every weekend.", "YWBTA.

You don't live there, you don't want to see him potentially jerk off? Maybe spend more time at your own place. Can't blame a dude for wanting to cum.\n\nOf course, it IS still kinda weird to jerk off when someone else can easily just walk in and see you. So he's not free from guilt, and of course he has more of a right to jerk off there, but it would be nice to be respectful of others.\n\nI would say if you've ever had sex with your boyfriend while the roommate was supposed to be sleeping, why would you ever consider judging him? Of course, that's just a hypothetical, I don't know about your personal habits.\n\nLike if he's going to have his own room, this won't be a problem. If it is a problem and he's some kind of exhibitionist, maybe deal with that later--but basically right now he's just a horny teenager trying to cum. That's what most teenagers are trying to do in college, but some don't have partners to help.", "YTA, You're in his space and you confirmed in the comments he didn't think he was being seen. I see multiple people throw the word consent around and reacted to it so I will say the same here: he doesn't need your consent to touch his own body, especially if he's not doing it to be seen and harassing you with it. I'm more disgusted by people thinking you can stay in someone's space where they already have little to no privacy and then saying stuff like \"he did it without your consent\". People need to stop using buzzwords they hear online. Consent has nothing to do with this story. You have a room and you choose not to stay there cause you don't like it there and that's fine. but If you're in someone else's space and you catch them doing something by accident you don't make a problem out of it. it's not your house.\n\nI lived with a friend for a while and sometimes he and his gf would make a lot of noise or accidentally not close the door completely and I walk by and see things I didn't wanna see. I don't complain about it cause it was his house where I stayed. Do I want to see it? no. But I'm also an adult that understands people have needs and it's his house and he can do what he wants. if I don't like it I can leave.", "YATA,  Its their room they share and you shouldn\u2019t be there to begin with.   Wtf do you want him to do wake you both up and ask you both to leave!?   If you are uncomfortable around that, you shouldn\u2019t be sharing a room with him.   Its 50% his room and 0% yours.  Itd be different if he did it in the middle of the room expecting you to see it, but he thought you were asleep", "YWBTA. You are actually invading his privacy by being there. That is his room that he paid for. He gets to do his thing. Sure it is weird as all get out but it is his room and the only place he gets some privacy,  kinda. Should he do it with you there? No, it's weird, but he's probably someone who doesn't care and wants to do his business and get on with his day. Doesn't sound like he was staring at you which is what I expected  given this is reddit. Question, how does he feel with you doing couple things right next to him? Think he loves hearing you guys kiss and move? Give you are disgusted by the sight of him in guessing you don't have sex with him in the room.\n\nThis is guy stuff in a guy space. At the end of the day that is not your room.", "NTA, and I am not defending his nasty ass, but keep in mind that you invade his personal space every weekend because it\u2019s convenient for you.

Respectfully.\n\nI say that because the roommate already has limited privacy and now he has to share a room with you too on the weekends. I'm sure he believed you and your bf were sleeping and that's why he did it. \n\nDon't say anything and look at it from his perspective.

It happens more often than you think but your bf can at least casually bring it up like hey my girl caught you mind not doing it when she\u2019s over laugh it off ig", "I don\u2019t think YOU should confront him, but it would be better if your BF did it. \n\nBased on the other answers here, I guess I\u2019ll get downvoted but, masturbating in a shared dorm in the bedroom is wrong when the other person is there. Either do it when you\u2019re alone or go into the bathroom. Masturbating next to someone who hasn\u2019t consented isn\u2019t okay IMO. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s your dorm too, it is still wrong. \n\nAnd if you won\u2019t do it in the bathroom or wait till you\u2019re alone, don\u2019t live in a shared dorm.", "Nta. This is gross and he was so inappropriate", "YWNBTA. \n\nThat he was doing that in shared room without the other occupant's consent was completely inappropriate. \n\nI would suggest letting your boyfriend handle it though, especially since you mentioned that he was also uncomfortable with it. Then it becomes about \"Hey roommate, it's not cool for you to do this in our shared space while I'm there\" rather than you telling him what he can and can't do in his own room, if that makes sense.

So he\u2019s there third wheeling in his home on a weekend when he might like to rest. Your boyfriend loving to spend time with you, as you\u2019ve mentioned multiple times, is not his roommate\u2019s concern. You\u2019re invading his living space that he paid for.

Clinically, you have been sexually assaulted by his forcing you to be exposed to his sexual conduct. Please be aware that voyeurism is a solid red flag of an individual potentially having a dangerous personality disorder. \n\nI understand that you\u2019re the victim and trying to make sense of what has happened. It\u2019s natural for your mind to try and rectify how it\u2019s possible this man you\u2019ve felt comfortable with would exercise such a significant lack of discretion and sense of violation of someone\u2019s boundaries. \n\nWe\u2019re looking at 3 things. 1. Why did he not have the natural sense of privacy and shame in not doing something sexual while in the company of a non-consenting person. 2. When he became aware that you woke up and could be violated by being exposed to this why was he capable of finishing an orgasm? The response that is wnl would be an inability to continue. 3. Your response to just not say anything is because victims don\u2019t want life to change, it\u2019s vulnerable and scary to confront abuse. You\u2019re supposed to work with him now and in the future, what are you going to do if you\u2019re not safe around him? \n\nMy guess is that he has an addiction and is dependent on the dopamine rush from jacking off. He didn\u2019t care how it effected you, because that\u2019s what addicts do. His brain was craving the rush. As others have said, this is not an isolated event. Also, the fact that he was able to finish shows that he sees you as an object of arousal. Maybe he didn\u2019t see you see him, but he knew the risk of it happening was high and it either turned him on or off, clearly the answer is ON. \n\nYour boyfriend seems to know what is going down. Maybe you should call a DV shelter and speak to a victims advocate privately to sort out the experience.

It's exactly what it is. For context, I'm (19f) a freshman college student, and I'm still living in a dorm because of the law. On the weekends, I like to spend the weekend over at my bf's (19m) dorm, and he shares this small room with his roommate (19m), so privacy is a very difficult thing to achieve. \n\nWell, yesterday morning (Sunday morning) my bf's roommate was up a little earlier than me and my bf, because he has to work in a couple of hours. He's usually not too disruptive, but I woke up to check on the time and see if the roommate is still there. Well, I opened my eyes for a good second and I saw him going at it. I saw everything. He wasn't covering himself or anything like that. I'm surprised I didn't scream. So, I quickly laid back down and had my covers over my head. My bf was still asleep, but I was fully awake now. I wanted to throw up and cry. It wasn't really something I wanted to see at all. \n\nAs I was still awake, he was still going at it, because I could hear the noises he was making. I was very uncomfortable, but I didn't know what to do. So, I just laid there and waited for him to finish. Luckily, he did his business shortly and got ready for work. \n\nAfter he left the room, I quickly got up. My bf woke up, and he could already tell something was up. He asked what was up, but I was very hesitant, because I didn't want to gross him out. Well, he assured me that it will be all ok, so I told him, and he was not happy. He was visibly upset. He asked me if he should talk with the roommate about it, but I said no, because I feared the roommate would be upset at me for invading his privacy. My bf understood, but he said that he will talk to the roommate about it if it happens again. \n\nSo, my issue now is that ever since the incident, I feel very different and uncomfortable whenever I'm around the roommate. He's going to live with us in a couple of months when we all move out of our dorms. So, should I talk with my bf's roommate about it? Will I be the bad guy if I did? I'm happy to hear any advice.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I saw you jerking off this morning and it made me uncomfortable. Could you maybe do that when I'm not around? Thanks.\"\n\nHe might not even realize you noticed.

Yeah they are sharing a room but he fully has the option to go to the washroom to do his business.

I was horrified and froze.\nIt felt like ages before they finished. I lay there, frozen and getting more and more desperate for the toilet.  Finally, it was over.\nI lay there for a bit longer, wondering how long I had to wait to \"wake up\" to go for a pee.

Do they completely abstain from any form of intimacy while he is in the room, even if he is sleeping?", "This logic makes no sense. It doesn't matter who's dorm it is, it's fuckin creepy to masturbate in a small room next to two people. Because things happen like THE PEOPLE WAKING UP AND SEEING IT. \n\nIt literally doesn't matter who the dorm is for, you can be respectful and go to the bathroom or shower if you have the urge. \n\nExcusing doing something like that with \"I'm the one that lives here\" is just sad.", "Aggressively gross take.

Unfortunately, my bf and roommate have been friends for over a year, and I don't think my bf can change roommates, since the semester is halfway over.", "Yeah. I want to let it slide this time just to avoid troubles, but because my bf was uncomfortable with it, he wants to talk with the roommate about it the next time it happens.", "I completely get what you're saying.

My bf and I would be more than happy to go find somewhere in the city to do so.", "It\u2019s better than masturbating while two (or even one) other people are in room with you. \n\nThe best situation would be to wait until the BF has a class at a time that he doesn\u2019t and then do it then. That way no one has to have the awkward conversation and no one has to be uncomfortable that someone is jerking off 10\u2019 away from them.", "I understand.

He's more than welcome to ask for privacy. As for my roommate, I'm just not really confrontational. I trust my roommate not to mess with my stuff, because we made an agreement a while back.", "Yes. I'm fully aware of that. If he really needs a lot of private space, he's more than welcome to ask my bf and I to go somewhere else.", "But it\u2019s not just His Space. It\u2019s also his roommates space. And yeah consent comes in to play when you\u2019re in a shared space regardless of if it\u2019s your body or not. If it was his bedroom sure whatever. But it sounds like it\u2019s a bedroom shared by two people with a third sleeping over. And 2 out of 3 were uncomfortable with the other going at it so openly and close to them.", "His house..? It's a college dorm shared by two people and going off ops description it's not sectioned off, just one room where there designed one half.\nAnd regardless, if it's your space or home or whatever that does not mean you can masturbate in front of others.", "Once the roommate allowed her to keep coming over without saying anything or stopping it the roommate has knowingly commented to a female being in the room, it isn't HIS space it's his and his roommates space. And yes you do need consent to jack off in front of people even in your space, ask Harvey weinstein or Louis CK.", "So you have no problem with flashers then?  People that go out in public with the intention of showing their naked body to unsuspecting victims. What about the adult flashers that target teenagers? Without concent this is SA. No one is touching anyone else in these situations. \nAnd I know a naked body is not inherently sexual, but the context of the action changes that. \n\nConsent is needed when involving someone else in acts of a sexual nature, it doesn't matter if someone is being touched by someone else.\n\nBeing a shared space has no relevance in this.

She's just too chicken shit to work things out with her own roommate.", "and that's a lie.

We're all in the same room", "Since he thinks it is ok, there will totally be a next time. It really serves no purpouse to let this slide. The easiest thing to do if you don't want to stir the pot too much would be to let you boyfriend tell him that he noticed him and he is not comfortable with that happening next to him. This way you, the guest, are not the one involved and if the roomate does it again then he is doing it knowing there is a boundary in place and there will be concequences.", "that's different when you live with someone, being confrontational to someone you have to share your home with invited more trouble into your life.

That's absurd.

If he has had to resort to pleasuring himself while you're in the room, he's almost certainly *not* cool with it -- but he doesn't feel like he can come out and say that to you, for any number of reasons.", "I don't know what you want to hear from me, my opinion is that it's just an excuse. Take it or leave it. Again, an opinion.", "Again I said before I myself wouldn't do it and it's inappropriate for me. But this is where he lives and you can't tell him what to do with his own body or not, especially not in his space. you guys are siting here acting like he's just walking around jerking off in front of everyone.

K thanks bye!", "It\u2019s his right to ask his roommate to not do that while you\u2019re around. If roommate has actually been bothered by your presence, or feels as though you should be there less, he can take that opportunity to share that with your boyfriend. That is also roommates\u2019 right, so be prepared for that. \n\nThe conversation needs to be had. Be aware that a compromise could end up being that you\u2019re there less, but It could be something as simple as \u201cI was groggy and horny and did not think, I\u2019m very sorry, it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d", "I'm sorry. This is my 1st post ever on Reddit, so I guess I'm a bit overwhelmed lol. But, I'm sorry if I sounded defensive. I do understand what you're saying", "I meant, of course, that you eat in the kitchen, you crap in the bathroom, and jerk off in your bed. That's the places for that.\n\nAnd every woman I've known administers self pleasure (my favorite term was \"Jilling off\").", "Yeah I see in that case I'm so sorry you had to see that. Honestly maybe your bf should talk to him, just like 'hey we saw you it was weird dont do that'", "I'm aware of that.", "Well, what about my bf? He pays for the room too, and he was very upset at the fact the roommate did his business while in the same room as us. \n\nEdit: Obviously, the roommate didn't ask my bf if he could masturbate in the same room. \n\nAs for the \"advanced notice\", it's not even just for masturbation. It can be for many things, like just being alone or something.", "Well, you are right, I should have expected since it's a bedroom shared by guys \ud83d\ude02. As for me having no choice other than staying in my bf's dorm, my bf prefers me coming over to his place (with permission of the roommate) than coming over to my place because my place is a female-only dorm. My bf is really not comfortable with that, because he's scared of being accused of something he didn't do. \n\nAnd, I've just realized that I should have mentioned that a lot sooner.", "This wasn't in the middle of the night. This happened around 8:00 am. Also, my bf doesn't want the roommate to do his business while my bf is in the room, whether he's asleep or not.", "We can do that.", "He didn't not say anything though, in multiple comments op says the roommate was asked if it was ok she stayed and the roommate said he was happy for her to be there, not only did he agree to her being there he did so happily.", "Oh, I understand. I leave the dorm every Sunday at 8pm, because I have early morning classes. Anyways, I completely understand that making my issue into the roommate's issue is not ok. Again, he's very confrontational. He'll confront anyone for just about anything. He'll talk with me or my bf if he has an issue with me coming over on the weekends. One of the reasons why he doesn't mind me coming over on the weekends is because he works over the weekends (all day Saturday and Sunday).", "Again I disagree. It\u2019s a shared space with her BF. If the BF doesn\u2019t want him masturbating while he\u2019s in the room that\u2019s it. Just because he pays for the room doesn\u2019t mean he gets to do whatever he wants to while his roommate is there. I mean he wasn\u2019t even trying to hide it, OP said she saw everything. He could at least have the decency to do it under the covers. \n\nI\u2019m 100% certain that if it got to the point of taking it to the college administration they would see it my way and not yours.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying that they should take it to administration. I\u2019m also not trying to paint this guy as a pervert, I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t trying to put on a show. I understand we all love to masturbate, that\u2019s fine. What I am saying is that if the BF approaches his roommate and says \u201chey dude, no jerking when I\u2019m in the room\u201d then the roommate 100% has to respect that.", "You absolutely can have expectations of what people do in their spaces when those spaces are shared. He did it in full view, not even under a blanket and was noisy about it. That isn't someone who is respecting other people's space. His body his choice doesn't really work when he's involving other people.", "Is it? That seems less weird to me bc you use it privately. It's not like there isn't \"gross\" stuff going on in bathrooms all the time, but it's not hard to clean up after yourself lol", "Fucking ew \ud83e\udd2e I have no words \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Not a flex", "I'm completely aware of that. I'm not entitled to their room, so I know that there is a chance I'll show up less often.", "\"Jilling off\" \ud83d\ude02. I'll keep that noted. I understand what you're saying now. It's just hard with shared bedrooms, even when I'm not in the room.", "He shouldn\u2019t have to schedule time in his own room for either of you.", "He's your bf used his big boy words and told the roommate this? Or just assumed, like how you assumed his roommate is cool with having zero privacy?", "I wasn't really addressing this situation in particular. Just the hole in your logic.", "You really need to add these tidbits of info to your main post. They\u2019re highly relevant.", "But you're missing the point that the boyfriend either never had a problem with it or noticed it. This situation is her catching him. Everyone who lives with someone knows they do stuff ar some point, stop acting like a child this is reality.", "Thanks. Appreciated", "It seems highly resolvable. The mobile home you mentioned is just for you and your bf, yes?", "Again, it's my bf's room, too. My bf doesn't want the roommate to masturbate while they're both in the same room.", "I've picked up on that \ud83d\ude05. This is my 1st reddit post.", "No. If he never noticed then he\u2019s lucky. That doesn\u2019t make it ok. OP\u2019s boyfriend pays the same amount as his roommate and he is entitled to not have to have someone masturbating 10\u2019 away from him. \n\nI\u2019m not acting like a child, acting like a child is trying to discreetly masturbate while someone else is in a small shared dorm room.\n\nThis college, why can\u2019t the roommate just wait until the BF has a class and he doesn\u2019t? Even in a shared room there is always time where he will have actual privacy.", "Best reply ever!  Touche!", "Well, it's for me, my bf, AND the roommate.", "[deleted]", "You don't get to decide if that's okay or not. It's not okay to you because you can catch him. But he chooses what he does with his body in his home.  You don't have to agree but you don't make those rules", "I thought it was common knowledge to not do any sexual activities in the room with others that didn't give consent. My bf obviously didn't consent to it.", "I don\u2019t get to decide if it\u2019s okay, but OP\u2019s boyfriend does. Just because he lives in the room it doesn\u2019t give him full rights to masturbate and potentially put on a show for his roommate. That\u2019s not how it works. OP\u2019s boyfriend also pays to live in the same space and has the right to not have someone masturbate across the room from him. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying the roommate is a pervert, but that still doesn\u2019t make it acceptable. Like I said before, if they took this matter to administration I\u2019m absolutely certain it would align with what I\u2019m saying and not you. I don\u2019t think they should take it to that extreme without trying to deescalate the situation, I\u2019m just putting it in to perspective of who is \u201cin the right\u201d."]}
