My father decided to marry my stepmother. All is good and well for him. I\u2019m happy for him. There\u2019s a problem for me though. I literally do not know my step siblings. And he decided to get married to the woman to never introduced me to them. I met only 1 of them briefly. My older sister lives with my father so she is able to see them on a regular basis. I live on my own so i don\u2019t see anyone. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if i was invited to the wedding to meet them. However. My dad called me about the wedding to tell me. And never invited me. I didn\u2019t mind because i thought he would bring it up later and i would ask him. He didn\u2019t contact me until after the wedding ( about a month and a half ). I cried to my mother about not being able to see my father on his happiest day. He then decided to contact finally and talk. I casually brought up how was the wedding. He said it was good. I said do you have any pictures. He sent them and said \u201cI missed you being there\u201d And i replied why didn\u2019t you invite me? He said you didn\u2019t want to go. I said you never invited me in the first place i would have gone if you did. He then said \u201cI\u2019ll probably find it in our texts that you said no\u201d I gave him a bit of time to search through our texts and he then found nothing and this started a whole argument for both of us on how i wasn\u2019t invited. I started getting pissed off after trying to end the conversation multiple times. He then said \u201cYou\u2019re trying to make me feel guilty and i don\u2019t think i should\u201d And that\u2019s what got me. I was offended and i lashed out on him saying how was i making him feel guilty. He then started playing these cards of guilt to me and i handed them back to him making him feel even guiltier for bringing them up because they weren\u2019t related to the conversation. He gave up and said he was going to bed and he loves me and how i will always be his daughter. I never replied. Should i even be angry in the first place?", "created_utc": 1699114520, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17np1xg/aita_for_making_my_dad_feel_badnot_on/", "score": 371, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Words without action mean nothing.", "NTA. At some point your Dad should have realized he hadn\u2019t invited you but honestly he\u2019s have to care enough about you to even realize it. The fact is he didn\u2019t even think about you.", "You are NTA. He is. If it was me, I wouldn\u2019t invite him to my wedding should I get married. Kind of leave him out. But that is me.

He didn't invite you and tried to gaslight you about it. If he feels guilty, that's his problem. But you are right not to play games with him or pretend you were invited, when you weren't.

Your dad messed up, but he should have quickly apologized and said he thought he had invited you. Nothing you did seems wrong here. You only mentioned him not inviting you when he implied he wanted you to be there. You only argued back when he made it a thing. He was being manipulative not you. He is trying to blame you for his emotions, which is not cool. \n\nYour dad sounds not great and terrible at communication.

His just trying to justify his reasons for being an absolute shit of a parent. Honestly I would get extremely petty and put a post up about how everyone looked good and how sad you are that apparently you are not part of the family and did not receive an invite but you are glad they had a great time but you can no longer make all the effort in the relationship with him and start blocking people. Can I ask if your sister knows you weren\u2019t invited? What is her reaction in this?", "My sister knows but i have not talked to her in 2 years because we hate eachother and blocked eachother LOL.

If you have a relationship with your father, there is no excuse for him not inviting you. I would be taking a break from contact with him.

I don\u2019t really know but i know he knows we do not contact eachother. It\u2019s possible she could have convinced him that it was bad for me to show up to the wedding because of our poor sister relationship. But she\u2019s 4 years older than me. She should know that i would be on my best behavior. And if she would ruin it just because i was there then it\u2019s childish. But i have a feeling if i did show up, she would sabotage me one way or another"]}
