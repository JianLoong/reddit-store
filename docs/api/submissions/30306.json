My father decided to marry my stepmother. All is good and well for him. I\u2019m happy for him. There\u2019s a problem for me though. I literally do not know my step siblings. And he decided to get married to the woman to never introduced me to them. I met only 1 of them briefly. My older sister lives with my father so she is able to see them on a regular basis. I live on my own so i don\u2019t see anyone. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if i was invited to the wedding to meet them. However. My dad called me about the wedding to tell me. And never invited me. I didn\u2019t mind because i thought he would bring it up later and i would ask him. He didn\u2019t contact me until after the wedding ( about a month and a half ). I cried to my mother about not being able to see my father on his happiest day. He then decided to contact finally and talk. I casually brought up how was the wedding. He said it was good. I said do you have any pictures. He sent them and said \u201cI missed you being there\u201d And i replied why didn\u2019t you invite me? He said you didn\u2019t want to go. I said you never invited me in the first place i would have gone if you did. He then said \u201cI\u2019ll probably find it in our texts that you said no\u201d I gave him a bit of time to search through our texts and he then found nothing and this started a whole argument for both of us on how i wasn\u2019t invited. I started getting pissed off after trying to end the conversation multiple times. He then said \u201cYou\u2019re trying to make me feel guilty and i don\u2019t think i should\u201d And that\u2019s what got me. I was offended and i lashed out on him saying how was i making him feel guilty. He then started playing these cards of guilt to me and i handed them back to him making him feel even guiltier for bringing them up because they weren\u2019t related to the conversation. He gave up and said he was going to bed and he loves me and how i will always be his daughter. I never replied. Should i even be angry in the first place?", "created_utc": 1699114520, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17np1xg/aita_for_making_my_dad_feel_badnot_on/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why i might be the asshole is he thinks i said no but i kept on telling him he never invited me so i never gave a yes or no answer so that might of confused him.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He should feel guilty. He knows what he did was wrong and is going the narcissistic attack of turning it back on you.\n\nI'm so sorry! Truly, his loss. I can only imagine what some of the people at the wedding thought as it is a huge reflection on him with you not being there.", "NTA\n\nYour father may \"love\" you in his own way, but he has no desire to maintain a relationship with you. It's fine to be angry and to grieve the relationship you don't have and likely will never have.", "nta. your dad not inviting you to his wedding may not feel like a big deal to him, but for most people it is a huge deal. it makes perfect sense to me that this hurt you, and imho he deserves to feel bad. he should feel guilty. he can say he loves you and you\u2019ll always be his daughter, but a good dad won\u2019t just say that, he\u2019ll act like it. he messed this up from start to finish. if he won\u2019t say it, i will; i\u2019m sorry he did that. you deserved better from him.", "NTA. Your dad is the one who is obligated to invite you. No one is obligated to invite themselves. Good luck with your relationship with him, it\u2019s indeed messed up and I unfortunately doubt that bothers him. A normal parent would have A) invited you or B) moved heaven and earth to make up for it after not having done so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
