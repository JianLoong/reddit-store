As the baby in the family, she was spoiled by my mother, and as such, my father wasn't allowed to discipline her. She always got away with things, because, for these reasons, they would just ignore it. \nMyself, and two other sisters, have been successful as parents, and we are all professionals in our field. She has three failed marriages, dropped out of college just shy of completion twice, and never kept a job for more than a couple of years. No, money doesn't equal success, and we are all just comfortable middle class types. She's been a financial drain on my parents her whole life; cars, tickets, utilities, taking care of her 2 kids. The list goes on.\nMy widowed mother moved into a retirement home a few years ago, and after the last divorce,  sister has lived in her home for about 2 years. I don't go there just because we don't see eye to eye, but i do look after all of moms affairs, including her properties. I finally looked through the door, and the conditions  are horrible. Just pure trash! I mean, rotten food on the table and floor. Garbage can empty, but take out containers on the floor.\nI later summoned up the courage to go in. Cat feces on the carpet, unusable restrooms, clothes piled up so high, you'd think they just get more, rather than do laundry. Any episode of Hoarders would be comparable. Roaches INSIDE the fridge!  And she has been staying with her boyfriend in a other town, leaving the kids, barely 18, and 12, both still in school, in this house. This has been conditions she left her previous homes before, so not an isolated incident. \nI asked the right people some questions,  and called code enforcement.  He saw, then called an investigator to witness it. He said it was a fire hazard, and a biohazard.\nAll steps along this path have been with the knowledge of my other sisters, and out mother.\nSister says I should have called her first and straightened this all out. I told her that, with her history, there was nothing I could say that would make a difference, and this was too big for me to handle. Code enforcement is required to report if abuse or neglect is suspected, so now child services is involved,  which I expected from the beginning. The children are my primary concern, anyway.\n\nAm I the AH for not calling her first, even though I knew it would do no good?", "created_utc": 1698081779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17epul0/aita_for_calling_child_services_on_my_sister/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
