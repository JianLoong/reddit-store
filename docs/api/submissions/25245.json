After a couple of months, we started dating. \n\nWe took things slow, mainly because her past trauma. When in high school, she had a boyfriend (M29) and during their senior year, she was diagnosed with cancer. Apparently, the guy had cheated on her while she was receiving chemo. When she needed him most, she was left alone. Not only did he cheat on her, but when he was confronted, he blamed my wife for being inattentive, always tired, and unattractive. My wife had blamed herself for her illness for months after that and finally broke things off with him after 2 years because she thought he deserved better. After beating cancer, the guy had the audacity to  get back together with her. They had an on and off relationship \nfor 3-4 years. Naturally, my wife had developed some severe trust issues and insecurities that impacted our relationship initially. \n\nAfter she began to trust me and love herself again, everything was going amazingly.

I wanted to be with her. Be by her side each step of the way to recover once again. And since I loved her and could see myself marrying her in the future, I proposed. I mean, why wait when I could at least assure her I would be there for her no matter what? So we married with a simple ceremony. \n\nUnfortunately, her cancer was progressively getting worse. Her fatigue started to be more severe each day. Chemo was making her forgetful. I tried to fulfil her dreams and wishes until the day she passed away. I was miserable.

You are having a hard time and keeping or sending the letter are both valid choices, as things stand. You might be too close to the situation to make a call anyway.

I would just leave it alone", "NTA. If she wanted him to have it. She would have mailed it out, or asked you to.\n\nWriting letters that are never sent is standard therapy.", "NTA.\n\nThere is a good chance that the letter was a purely therapeutic exercise, and was never meant to be sent.", "NTA\n\nI am so, so sorry for your loss. The letter is just a letter, no one knows if she wanted it to be sent. She had time, I think, or could have asked you, if that was what she wanted. She could have just written it to get things off her chest.", "NTA She didn\u2019t send it to him so you shouldn\u2019t either", "NTA\n\nhe doesn\u2019t care, never cared and there isn\u2019t anything in the letter that will change that.  Why burden yourself caring about someone who hurt your wife so much?", "NTA You are in agony right now. Do not start anymore chaos. If she wanted him to have it, she would have given it to him. Sometimes people write to get things off their minds. No good comes off this. Tell your friend to STFU. You don't need this right now.", "NTA. She had plenty of opportunity to give it to him, and chose not to.", "NTA. You can't automatically assume that she would want him to have it.  Letter writing can be a form of therapy with no intent of ever actually sending the letter.", "NTA- She could have given it to him and she did not.  Potentially she chose not to.\n\nYou know your partner.  Would they have wanted you to stress about this?  I know what my partner would say.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t mail it and she didn\u2019t ask you to give it to him. You have no way to know if she actually wanted him to have it or if she just used it as self-therapy.", "NTA, but please read the letter first. Maybe she was writing him to tell he was an AH, in which case, I'd give him the letter. But if she was forgetful in her last days, maybe the letter is incoherent and weird, and it's better not to show it to anyone and just destroy it.", "My first thought was that this letter was a therapeutic exercise- that she may or may not have meant to send it, but by the end of writing it she got any words she wanted to say to him out and didn't feel the need to send it. So, you're NTA for giving the lettee to her ex. As others have pointed out, it's been long enough that if she had meant to send it, she would have. Lastly, I hope you find the comfort you need in these times. You're not alone in your grief.", "NTA- it's a common therapy exercise to write a letter to someone to get out your feelings but never send it. Because the message isn't really for the person, it's about processing your own emotions.", "It wasn\u2019t delivered. Do what you wish. NTA either way.", "She had ample time to send the letter, but never did, even to her death. So therefore she did not want to send the letter and OP can either keep it or destroy it, up to him. Either would be consistent with her wishes.\n\nVery sorry for your loss, OP.\n\nSounds like you were who she needed and I hope that is some solace.", "Agreed. If it was known or written somewhere that she wanted him to have it then I would say YTA. \n\nShe could have written it just for herself as some form of healing/therapy with no intentions of ever giving it to him. Her intentions could also be in the letter, though I understand why OP wouldn't want to read it.", "Nonsense. She didn't ask him to pass the letter along. She didn't send it, herself, despite having had ample opportunity to do so. Conclusion: while it was important to her to *write* the letter, it was equally important to her that ex-BF *not read* it. If she wanted him to read it, she would have either sent it herself at some point in the last two years, or asked OP to send it after her death.", "NTA\nIf she didn't specifically ask you to give him the letter after she passed away, how do you know she'd want you to?\n\nI don't think you should feel obliged to give it to him at all.", "If she didn\u2019t tell you she wanted it given to him- don\u2019t. \n\nFor all you know it was an exercise for her own closure and wasn\u2019t meant for him.\n\nNAH", "Burn the letter. \n\nIt seems to me that she wrote the letter to get her feeling out more than a desire to tell him something. As others has said she could have sent it herself. Good on you for not reading words meant for someone else. But I have heard many stories where words written at the end of someone's life hurt those around them.\n\nProtect your memory of her. Don't read the letter and burn it.", "NTA \nWhile she was still alive, she decided not to send it. Maybe she never meant to. Who knows. Not up to you or her friends.", "NTA. Some people write letters to others to get their feelings off their chest. They never intend to give it to that person. I wouldn't give it to him since you only know that she wrote it and you don't know if she intended to give it to him. At the very least, you're leaving the letter how she left it.", "NTA, as part of my therapy, I've written plenty of letters to my abusive ex just to get what I need to say out, but I would never open a can of worms by sending them. It won't change anything. No one will ever know if that letter was meant for him to ever actually see, and she didn't say anything to you or leave you instructions. Pitch it, burn it, whatever makes you feel free of it. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. You have no idea what she wanted to do with the letter. I wouldn't feel comfortable giving it to him for that reason. She could have sent it to him or asked you to give it to him. But she didn't. I would absolutely not give it to him.", "NTA She didn't give him the letter, why should you?", "NTA. If she wanted him to have it, she would have sent it to him. Perhaps she wrote that to reconcile her own feelings as a part of a cathartic activity. I\u2019ve done that before. \n\nIt\u2019s not your friends\u2019 business. You were the one who loved her until the end. This other dude deserves nothing.", "You ever get really mad at your boss, write up an email calling them every name in the book, and then delete it?

If she wanted him to read it she would have gotten it to him.", "I would read it first and then decide, it might be an I forgive you, and if so I would burn it, but it could very well be her wanting to finally vent about what a terrible person he was and how much better her life was with him out of it.

It's possible that she wrote it for herself more than him.", "She must have been very emotional when se wrote the letter as she was just diagnosed again.\n\nShe didn't send the letter.\n\nBut she also didn't destroy it.\n\nObviously you don't want to read it.\n\nBut destroying it might not be what your wife intended either.\n\nINFO: Can't you let someone you trust, and who knew your wife well, read the letter and let THAT person decide if it's a good idea to send the letter or not?\n\nNAH", "Very true.

I absolutely would not have wanted others to read it or for them to be sent if something were to happen to me; I would hope anyone who would have stumbled on them to logically deduce by virtue of them not being sent, and with no instructions to do so, that it was a by-product of working through a difficult time, not a letter meant to be sent.\n\nOP is NTA", "YTA for being a spammer, in your post history you're claiming to be a 22-year old woman", "A Soft YTA but completely understandably.

During the last twenty years before she died, she did some terrible things to us and our kids, and some other people.   While we were coping with the chaos and the crises she created during those years, we wrote a lot of 'letters' to her that were actually just therapy for ourselves, things we wanted to say, but knew that they were pointless to say to her, because she didn't care about what her abuse did to others, if she got what she wanted from it.  We knew saying what we wanted to say, would only make her angry and her behavior worse. \n\nFor this reason, I'm saying NTA.  \n\nYour wife didn't mail or ask you to mail it for her.  She wrote it, because she wanted to write it. \n\nIf you don't know for sure yet what to do with this, put it in a box, with other things you might decide to keep, but aren't sure about.  Seal the box, and label it  \"review these in Year.\"   Put it on a top shelf and leave it alone for a few years.  When that year comes around, you will know whether to dump the whole box, pull out a few things, or revisit the entire contents.\n\nBut, if you decide to throw it away, that's okay, too.   You know what this person did to your wife, and how she suffered because of his behaviors.  **You know that you want nothing to do with this person, because of his behavior toward a suffering person.**   Whether her letter is kind and forgiving, or lays out his cruelty clearly, he sounds like my MIL, and that means he's not going to care what she says.  He's going to keep on doing what he wants, disrespecting and disregarding the needs of others.  He might not even bother to read it.  If it's nice, he could take it as proving his cruelty was okay.  If it holds him accountable, he's not going to give it a second thought, because he's that selfish.  Your wife left this with her other stuff, which means this is your decision, no one else's.   \n\nI think this is your decision, and for you and your needs, not seeing this person is probably healthiest for you.  Either choice is okay.  This isn't a will or an envelope full of letters to be sent as part of the will.", "that's it. she could have sent it but didn't. honestly i wouldn't have even thought of this. but you're 100% right. \n\nNTA, op.", "Curious that OP is both a 28yo male and a 22yo female, if you look at their posts....", "So much this. No good can possibly come out of reading it.", "I send you love and peace in your journey on this crappy road.", "I would just burn it and say that if she wanted him to have it, he would have it and just let it go.", "Yes. If it has no stamp she never intended to send it. Throw it away. If it has one on it she changed her mind. Throw it away. If it isn\u2019t addressed to you then don\u2019t read it. Throw it away. It will not do any good to read or send it. She has her closure. Her ex doesn\u2019t deserve anything more of her. And OP has no desire to read it, so that seals the deal. I usually trash my venting, but I have come upon some of it much later and I know it would hurt my SO to read it, even if I wrote it when I was feeling hurt.", "NTA - if she wanted him to have it she would have given it to him. She probably wrote down all her feelings (like therapists tell us to) and didn't send. Let go of the icky past and just focus on the good times for the two of you.", "NTA.  Please don\u2019t send the letter.  If she had wanted him to read it, she would have sent it herself.  Since she didn\u2019t send it, that shows that she didn\u2019t want him to have it.", "NTA.  She didn\u2019t mail the letter.  I would dispose of it and move on and not give it a second thought.", "Nta don\u2019t give it. Read it then burn it and take this secrets to your grave.  He\u2019s only going to read it and make fun of her like he did when she was alive.  Stop telling friends anything.", "NTA. You get to do what you want with that letter. She had it for awhile and never gave it to him. Burn it and release it to the wind. I am so sorry for your loss..OP you were the husband this young lady deserved.", "Info: is it fully addressed?\n\nIf so, and she wrote it after she was diagnosed the second time and feeling that she wasn\u2019t long for this earth, it\u2019s safe to assume that she wanted to get something off her chest. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA because what you\u2019re going through is uncharted waters. \n\nBut I\u2019d send it to him. I\u2019d actually put it in another envelope with a brief explanation and tell him to please not contact me.", "NTA\n\nJust to add to the chorus, unless she left EXPLICIT instructions that she wanted that letter delivered to her ex, you should not give it to him. She had the opportunity to arrange for its delivery and she didn't. You need to respect THAT. The letter was for her. Its not a reflection on you and obviously wasn't something she wanted to share with her ex.", "\u201cWrite a letter to the person who hurt/traumatized you but don\u2019t send it\u201d is a pretty common therapeutic tactic. It allows someone to say all the things they want to say to someone and get all of that off their chest without actually contacting someone they never want to contact again.\n\nPoint is it wouldn\u2019t shock me if that\u2019s what the letter is, in which case you absolutely should not send it.\n\nPersonally I think your best option is to shred it and forget it ever existed. If your wife wanted her ex to see it, she\u2019d have sent it or left you explicit instructions to send it. Shred it and don\u2019t let her ex (who clearly was a destructive force in your wife\u2019s life) affect your life.\n\nKeep in mind, if it\u2019s scathing and pisses him off, he is going to target *you* with his rage and anger. He can\u2019t go after your wife, so all of his anger and bullshit will end up in your lap. You don\u2019t need that when you\u2019re still grieving.\n\nNTA", "NTA. But since this is bothering you, is there anyone you trust to read it and make the call of whether it was intended to be sent or not?", "NTA.  If she had wanted him to read the letter she would have sent it to him or left instructions with someone to give it to him. Finding out her cancer came back probably triggered a lot of emotions for her, and probably really brought back all the emotions she went through from her ex's betrayal.  The letter may have been a cathartic exercise for her more then an actual letter to him.  Or maybe when she originally wrote it she though she would send it but changed her mind.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nYou are NTA if you choose to read it , discard it, show it to the ex. \n\nMight I suggest you show it to a trusty source or neutral party, and they can make a determination as to what you should do with it? Or maybe give yourself more time because maybe you\u2019ll want to read it in a few years- or maybe you\u2019ll be certain you don\u2019t want to read it, or certain you want him to have it/not have it. Maybe time is the answer?", "NTA, and I\u2019m really sorry for your loss. \ud83d\udc94", "Is it just me, or is OP both a 28yo male and a 22yo female if you look at their posts?", "It looks like a throwaway account- I don\u2019t see another post linked?", "There were, earlier. Three of them. All from a 22yo woman's perspective."]}
