The first time I saw her, she was at the bar, having a hard time carrying a few pints. I helped her carry some of the drinks back to her table and we started having small chitchats and exchanged numbers at the end of the night. After a couple of months, we started dating. \n\nWe took things slow, mainly because her past trauma. When in high school, she had a boyfriend (M29) and during their senior year, she was diagnosed with cancer. Apparently, the guy had cheated on her while she was receiving chemo. When she needed him most, she was left alone. Not only did he cheat on her, but when he was confronted, he blamed my wife for being inattentive, always tired, and unattractive. My wife had blamed herself for her illness for months after that and finally broke things off with him after 2 years because she thought he deserved better. After beating cancer, the guy had the audacity to  get back together with her. They had an on and off relationship \nfor 3-4 years. Naturally, my wife had developed some severe trust issues and insecurities that impacted our relationship initially. \n\nAfter she began to trust me and love herself again, everything was going amazingly. Until her cancer had returned. I guess because of her ex, she started to become more anxious each day as if her physical state wasn\u2019t enough to hurt her. There was no way I would leave her. I wanted to be with her. Be by her side each step of the way to recover once again. And since I loved her and could see myself marrying her in the future, I proposed. I mean, why wait when I could at least assure her I would be there for her no matter what? So we married with a simple ceremony. \n\nUnfortunately, her cancer was progressively getting worse. Her fatigue started to be more severe each day. Chemo was making her forgetful. I tried to fulfil her dreams and wishes until the day she passed away. I was miserable.  I couldn\u2019t bare living somewhere that reminded me so much of her. After a while, I had the courage to go through her belongings to cherish and remember the moments we had. Among her stuff, I found a letter addressed to her ex. It was written around the time she was diagnosed for the second time. I can\u2019t get myself to read the letter nor to throw it away. I really don\u2019t want to give it to him, who didn\u2019t even show up to the funeral either. I consulted some of our mutual friends and they told me if she had written it to him, she would have wanted him to have it and I should at least respect that. Honestly, I want to forget that I have ever found this letter yet alone give it to him.

You said it was written, when she was diagnosted a second time. Wich should be two years ago, according to your story. She never mailed the letter.

You are having a hard time and keeping or sending the letter are both valid choices, as things stand. You might be too close to the situation to make a call anyway. Is there a family member or close friend of your wife you can entrust the letter to? Tell them they are allowed to do what they see fit with the letter and you do not want to know about their decision or any communication with or about the ex while mourning.", "NTA - if she wanted to send it to him she would have done it already or left instructions to send it after she was gone. I would just leave it alone", "NTA. If she wanted him to have it. She would have mailed it out, or asked you to.\n\nWriting letters that are never sent is standard therapy.", "NTA.\n\nThere is a good chance that the letter was a purely therapeutic exercise, and was never meant to be sent.", "NTA\n\nI am so, so sorry for your loss. The letter is just a letter, no one knows if she wanted it to be sent. She had time, I think, or could have asked you, if that was what she wanted. She could have just written it to get things off her chest.", "NTA She didn\u2019t send it to him so you shouldn\u2019t either", "NTA\n\nhe doesn\u2019t care, never cared and there isn\u2019t anything in the letter that will change that.  Why burden yourself caring about someone who hurt your wife so much?", "NTA You are in agony right now. Do not start anymore chaos. If she wanted him to have it, she would have given it to him. Sometimes people write to get things off their minds. No good comes off this. Tell your friend to STFU. You don't need this right now.", "NTA. She had plenty of opportunity to give it to him, and chose not to.", "NTA. You can't automatically assume that she would want him to have it.  Letter writing can be a form of therapy with no intent of ever actually sending the letter.", "NTA- She could have given it to him and she did not.  Potentially she chose not to.\n\nYou know your partner.  Would they have wanted you to stress about this?  I know what my partner would say.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t mail it and she didn\u2019t ask you to give it to him. You have no way to know if she actually wanted him to have it or if she just used it as self-therapy.", "NTA, but please read the letter first. Maybe she was writing him to tell he was an AH, in which case, I'd give him the letter. But if she was forgetful in her last days, maybe the letter is incoherent and weird, and it's better not to show it to anyone and just destroy it.", "My first thought was that this letter was a therapeutic exercise- that she may or may not have meant to send it, but by the end of writing it she got any words she wanted to say to him out and didn't feel the need to send it. So, you're NTA for giving the lettee to her ex. As others have pointed out, it's been long enough that if she had meant to send it, she would have. Lastly, I hope you find the comfort you need in these times. You're not alone in your grief.", "NTA- it's a common therapy exercise to write a letter to someone to get out your feelings but never send it. Because the message isn't really for the person, it's about processing your own emotions.", "It wasn\u2019t delivered. Do what you wish. NTA either way.", "She had ample time to send the letter, but never did, even to her death. So therefore she did not want to send the letter and OP can either keep it or destroy it, up to him. Either would be consistent with her wishes.\n\nVery sorry for your loss, OP.\n\nSounds like you were who she needed and I hope that is some solace.", "Agreed. If it was known or written somewhere that she wanted him to have it then I would say YTA. \n\nShe could have written it just for herself as some form of healing/therapy with no intentions of ever giving it to him. Her intentions could also be in the letter, though I understand why OP wouldn't want to read it.", "Nonsense. She didn't ask him to pass the letter along. She didn't send it, herself, despite having had ample opportunity to do so. Conclusion: while it was important to her to *write* the letter, it was equally important to her that ex-BF *not read* it. If she wanted him to read it, she would have either sent it herself at some point in the last two years, or asked OP to send it after her death.", "NTA\nIf she didn't specifically ask you to give him the letter after she passed away, how do you know she'd want you to?\n\nI don't think you should feel obliged to give it to him at all.", "If she didn\u2019t tell you she wanted it given to him- don\u2019t. \n\nFor all you know it was an exercise for her own closure and wasn\u2019t meant for him.\n\nNAH", "Burn the letter. \n\nIt seems to me that she wrote the letter to get her feeling out more than a desire to tell him something. As others has said she could have sent it herself. Good on you for not reading words meant for someone else. But I have heard many stories where words written at the end of someone's life hurt those around them.\n\nProtect your memory of her. Don't read the letter and burn it.", "NTA \nWhile she was still alive, she decided not to send it. Maybe she never meant to. Who knows. Not up to you or her friends.", "NTA. Some people write letters to others to get their feelings off their chest. They never intend to give it to that person. I wouldn't give it to him since you only know that she wrote it and you don't know if she intended to give it to him. At the very least, you're leaving the letter how she left it.", "NTA, as part of my therapy, I've written plenty of letters to my abusive ex just to get what I need to say out, but I would never open a can of worms by sending them. It won't change anything. No one will ever know if that letter was meant for him to ever actually see, and she didn't say anything to you or leave you instructions. Pitch it, burn it, whatever makes you feel free of it. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. You have no idea what she wanted to do with the letter. I wouldn't feel comfortable giving it to him for that reason. She could have sent it to him or asked you to give it to him. But she didn't. I would absolutely not give it to him.", "NTA She didn't give him the letter, why should you?", "NTA. If she wanted him to have it, she would have sent it to him. Perhaps she wrote that to reconcile her own feelings as a part of a cathartic activity. I\u2019ve done that before. \n\nIt\u2019s not your friends\u2019 business. You were the one who loved her until the end. This other dude deserves nothing.", "You ever get really mad at your boss, write up an email calling them every name in the book, and then delete it? That\u2019s what your wife did, IMO. If she had wanted him to have it, she would have sent it, but I bet that the second diagnosis simply dredged up old wounds that she wanted to get out and vent.", "NTA. People often write a \u201cletter \u201c to someone as a therapeutic exercise to get something off their chest, with no intention or desire to ever give the letter to the \u201crecipient \u201c.  I think this is that kind of letter.  Your dear wife had time to give the ex the letter, she didn\u2019t.  Leave it at that.  I\u2019m so very happy for the time and love the 2 of you shared.", "NTA\n\nThe fact it never got to the ex says something. If she never asked you to send out letters she wrote, ***don't.***", "NTA some people write letters they never intend to send as a form of therapy. If she wanted him to read it she would have gotten it to him.", "I would read it first and then decide, it might be an I forgive you, and if so I would burn it, but it could very well be her wanting to finally vent about what a terrible person he was and how much better her life was with him out of it. If it\u2019s that, I would have it professionally framed and gift wrapped before I gave it to him.", "NTA. Burn it and move on.", "NTA. I'm so very sorry for your pain.", "NTA\n\nBurn it", "NTA.. Keep it put it away. One day you may want to read it. Or destroy it. Who knows. Just tuck it away for now.", "NTA. You don't owe him anything.", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. Sorry you found it.", "As a cancer survivor, NTA. She didn't send that letter for a reason, in my opinion that means that she didn't want him to have it. In therapy we're often told to write things out that we don't plan on sending, it can be therapeutic. I would absolutely not send it.", "[removed]", "Please don\u2019t read or send it. Just destroy it. She didn\u2019t send it for a reason and for all you know it was only written as a means to vent. Plenty of people do that, don\u2019t ruin your peace, cherish your memories.", "NTA. If she had wanted him to have it, she would have sent it to him. It's possible that she wrote it for herself more than him.", "She must have been very emotional when se wrote the letter as she was just diagnosed again.\n\nShe didn't send the letter.\n\nBut she also didn't destroy it.\n\nObviously you don't want to read it.\n\nBut destroying it might not be what your wife intended either.\n\nINFO: Can't you let someone you trust, and who knew your wife well, read the letter and let THAT person decide if it's a good idea to send the letter or not?\n\nNAH", "Very true. It\u2019s entirely possible that it was never the intention for the ex to read it. Since it\u2019s not totally clear (and therefore possible that OP isn\u2019t going against his late wife\u2019s wishes), I agree that OP is NTA. Even if the ex reading it was the original intention, the letter was never sent and there are no instructions making it clear that the letter needs to be sent now (I\u2019m assuming if there were instructions, this wouldn\u2019t even be a question because OP would hopefully honor his wife\u2019s wishes), meaning intentions changed.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
