We don't share any classes and we have different lunches, so really the only time we see eachother is when we take the bus. We don't sit together because we each have friends we talk to on the bus, but yesterday we happened to sit near eachother. She was on her phone. I think she takes it in the morning, uses it when she has free time at school, and puts it back when she gets home. I didn't confront her, because she would be able to just put it away and I'd have no proof. My plan is to text our parents that she has it in the morning tomarrow, and they'll see she has it when we get home. My friend group thinks that's a dick move, but she's punished so I don't see what I'm doing wrong. WIBTA if I tell our parents what she's sneaking her phone?\n\nEdit: I talked to my sister real quick. Based on the replies I decided to come clean and tell her I know.

If your parents aren't doing their job, as in keeping tabs on her that's on them and not for you to interfere. \n\nAnd TBH I think a month of no phone for that is kind of harsh.  I get that they don't want her to drink, but talking to her about the consequences of drinking underage and especially drinking and driving would be a better consequence than punishing her by taking away a phone for a month.\n\nI'm not really giving a judgment, because I think this is more moral dilemma rather than an AH move, but it isn't really your job, so if it were me and my siblings, I'd probably stay out of it instead.", "ESH except the younger sister.\n\n1) this is about doing in your sister, not helping her. You're not her parent and this is between your sister and your parents. Don't be a snitch because it gives you satisfaction.\n\n2) this is a dumb punishment. She lost her phone for a month for drinking in the family home? I totally understand why underage drinking is an issue, but flat out punishments are only going to drive her to drink somewhere else, which puts her at risk. Social isolation (taking away a phone definitely affects social relationships in teens) is never an effective punishment. \n\n3) \"thank god no one drove\".

If anything it will push her to it more.\n\nPunishments need to fit the crime(In what they are, not severity) and come with education.", "I\u2019m a parent and OP sounds exhausting. At 18 he\u2019s technically a grown man telling on his 15 year old sister.   He\u2019s acting like he\u2019s 5 telling on her,", "That's only part of it, she's also grounded outside of school.", "Acting like people underage don\u2019t drink all the time. A month long punishment for drinking is absurd. Parents are only making sure sister is more secretive and doesn\u2019t get caught next time", "With the added bonus of her hating her brother.", "And this is why the majority of us are telling her to be quiet.  There\u2019s no danger in what she\u2019s doing other than disobeying.", "That's your fault for doing it.", "Very clever.", "Perfection", "Yeah, I think this is the best response. He's not technically an asshole for telling but I also don't think he'd be an asshole for *not* telling. Overall I think this is a situation where it's better for OP to just stay out of it, telling his parents will just harm his relationship with his sister when for no real reason.\n\nThat being said I'd probably not talk to the sister about it either, otherwise she may throw him under the bus if she gets caught. Sometimes it's better to just be able to claim plausibly claim that you didn't know.", "YTA - While I agree it's important to be moral, it isn't immoral to mind your business in this situation. You aren't her parent.\n\nI come from a society where the drinking age is fairly low, at least compared to the USA, so a lot were drinking at 15.", "I disagree. Morally the right thing is to follow through with a punishment - so that is his sisters\u2019s morally right thing to do, not his. I don\u2019t believe that ethics demand he get involved in a situation that he is not involved in. \n\nNeither his sister or his parents need him practicing parenting for them. It\u2019s just not his role. His role is brother. As a brother he is not morally responsible for implementing punishment. \n\nYou could argue he has a moral obligation to the truth. And if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d say he needs to tell his sister he is aware she is violating punishment and he will not lie for her. But he also has no obligation to bring it up to the parents unless asked.", "Probably not, and I don't want her to know that I know, because then I might get smoke for not telling them sooner.", "Had to laugh at that, but I wouldn\u2019t help her get it back. But SIL older sister used to help her sneak in and out of the house all the time.", "*big bro", "I don't I just don't like her going against our parents.", "I hate to put it in these terms, but some day your parents won't be around.

Do you want to be the supportive older brother who minds his business or someone who only cares about being right?", ">She really doesn't need it for emergencies, she has the school phone, and the bus gets off next to our house.\n\nWhy is this your decision or call on what she needs?", "No way, SMASHED?! As opposed to just drunk? Woah...that changes everything...", " you're going down a path that's gonna lead to lifelong resentment, estrangement, and you'll deserve it", "Bro you\u2019re about to be in college lol", "That may be true but he\u2019s apparently in high school so how much experience does he have being an adult.  Turning 18 does not automatically make a person an adult. If you are in the US the only reason 18 is an adult is because they wanted them for the Viet Nam War draft.", "Exactly", "I figured, that punishment makes sense. To add onto my original comment, not saying I know you and your sisters relationship but you have about the same age difference as me and my older brother, if you tell your parents, that kind of thing could affect y\u2019all\u2019s relationship long term and not for the better. I know that might not matter to you, but if it does, this could be a chance to get closer. Underage drinking is no joke, you should think about talking to her yourself.", "Her fault for getting caught . Underage drinking is still underage drinking. A month is not a long time at all.", "If that's enough to warrant \"hatred\" she needs therapy. Siblings get into worse spats Than this and turn out fine. She's a child she'll get over it", "This isn\u2019t about a dumb mistake I made as a teenager. This is about me telling you that it harmed our relationship as siblings. It is not your job to parent your slightly younger sister. You\u2019re being purposefully obtuse to what people are explaining to you in these comments.", "Yeah, the \"not your job\" is the typical response I get.\n\n\"See something, say something\" is to me a moral imperative.\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks.", "He doesn't have to be her parent. He's her older brother and can set the example.", "\"See something, say something\" is a moral imperative, in my opinion.\n\nIt's the only way to counteract the bystander effect inherent in human psychology. The bystander effect is one of the things I hate most about humans.\n\nI know I go against the grain with this opinion. But it's mine to give.\n\nSo, as I warn, this will burn bridges.

You're not her parent, get a life.\n\nYTA", "Too bad. She probably doesn't like that you're a rat.", "My brother and I always had each others back growing up as kids.

She was in her own home. Parents should be glad she did it responsibly", "Maybe hatred is an exaggeration, but you can't expect your sibling to be grateful and to want to be your friend when you snitched on them.", "I totally agree with see something say something for things that are really important.

I balance it with \"not my circus, not my monkeys\" because I'm nosy and need balance lol", "This isn't setting an example, it's just narking.", "Brother", "Yes. See his sister, tell his sister.", "That's not your job. Thats your parents job. Your job is to make sure she's safe. Want to be a good brother? Talk to her.

She is your peer, not your subordinate, no matter how your parents treat you vs. how they treat her.\n\nLet me tell you how this ends. Your sister learns she can\u2019t trust her parents when she screws up. She learns she can\u2019t trust her brother when she screws up. When she needs guidance, she relies on other people her age - maybe they\u2019re a good influence, maybe not. Either way, when she screws up, she screws up big time because at no point does she feel like she can back out. If somehow she escapes her adolescence unscathed, she\u2019ll continue not trusting the three of you through her adulthood. Whatever influence you\u2019re trying to exert now will be irrelevant because she will never allow you to inject your judgements into her life again.\n\nBut you do you. At 18, I\u2019m sure you think you know what you\u2019re doing. Good luck.", "Why? You are her brother. You are not her parent.

This is on your parents for not securing the phone in a place she couldn\u2019t get her hands on it.  You are not your sister\u2019s keeper.  Some things are best left unsaid.

It doesn't change the past and the fact the she has *already broken* the punishment. All she has to do now is make sure OP also doesn't see, and she can keep breaking the punishment.\n\nBurned bridge, with no real change to the situation at all.\n\nAnd nothing happens about the fact that she already broke the punishment... OP is the one making that choice instead of leaving it up to the parents to make that choice.\n\nBy telling the parents instead, all he's doing is giving them the information for *them* to do *their* job. They may or may not punish her; they may just hide the phone better. She may never even find out he tattled. Thus the punishment is enforced and potentially not even a bridge burned, unless the information that he tattled comes out later, etc.\n\nBy simply passing the information to the parents, it leaves all the choices about what to do with that information in the parents' hands instead of in OP's hands (or even the sister's hands).\n\nThe parents are the authority and authority performs its role best when it has all the necessary and relevant information at its disposal to make choices with. This is relevant information. Pass it to them. And then step back and let them make the choices."]}
