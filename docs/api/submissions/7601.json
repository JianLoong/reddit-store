I didn't confront her, because she would be able to just put it away and I'd have no proof.

If your parents aren't doing their job, as in keeping tabs on her that's on them and not for you to interfere. \n\nAnd TBH I think a month of no phone for that is kind of harsh.  I get that they don't want her to drink, but talking to her about the consequences of drinking underage and especially drinking and driving would be a better consequence than punishing her by taking away a phone for a month.\n\nI'm not really giving a judgment, because I think this is more moral dilemma rather than an AH move, but it isn't really your job, so if it were me and my siblings, I'd probably stay out of it instead.", "ESH except the younger sister.\n\n1) this is about doing in your sister, not helping her. You're not her parent and this is between your sister and your parents. Don't be a snitch because it gives you satisfaction.\n\n2) this is a dumb punishment. She lost her phone for a month for drinking in the family home? I totally understand why underage drinking is an issue, but flat out punishments are only going to drive her to drink somewhere else, which puts her at risk. Social isolation (taking away a phone definitely affects social relationships in teens) is never an effective punishment. \n\n3) \"thank god no one drove\".

But the statistics are very clear that it is a minority of the population that are driving under the influence, and numbers fall even further when you add in effective public transport, easy access to cabs, urbanized living, etc. Why is it a \"thank god\" situation?\nYou know most people who sit down in a basement to have a few with friends don't pile drive into a full school bus 3 hours later. \n\nI don't know what's going on between you as sisters, but if you do this, she will remember.", "Grey area, if that is allowed as a choice, your sister did something wrong and she needs to be punished, that's understandable, however it's not up to you to enforce that punishment, it's your parents. \n\nYes you can tell them, but you'll most likely cause conflict between you and your sister, however, if your parents catch your sister and find out you knew then potential conflict with your parents.\n\nIt's kinda a lose lose situation.\n\nA no win situation could be confronting your sister without involving your parents, explain that you know she's using her phone and she can hide it all she wants but it's your word against hers, plus her phone would have records of conversations etc during the time of her punishment.\n \nAgain, grey area", "Mind your business.", "What kind of sibling snitch shit is this?
