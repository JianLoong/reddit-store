She did not plan well nor take any steps to obtain the software she needs. She assumed your laptop was an option, and is rather rudely demanding it instead of looking for an alternative solution.\n\nIt's been a few decades since I was in school, but I'm just wondering- are computer labs on campus a thing of the past?", "NTA. Her lack of preparation (or a suitable computer) is not your emergency.

It seems she was planning on using your machine all along and is now taking it out on you when you refused. \n\nIt would seem that her plan going forward was to get you to sacrifice so that she would always get what she wanted.

It's not your fault or responsibility, but presumably you love her and want her to succeed, so figuring out a way she can get this last-minute shit done in this instance is the kind thing to do, and also a conversation that you won't let her lack of planning become your emergency in the future. Maybe some brainstorming on how to better coordinate (if you are willing to let her use your computer sometimes) and/or how she can better manage her deadlines. She doesn't need a lecture - she probably already knows she screwed the pooch here, but it would be best if y'all had some sort of plan going forward.", "INFO: can you use hers while she sits the one exam?\n\nFeels like a NAH situation to me. She thinks that you can share stuff in a pinch (which this presumably is, and I hope she\u2019s not usually this disorganised/has a pattern of expecting people to bail her out), and you don\u2019t (hope that that would swing both ways if you made a fuck up though.) \n\nIf you can borrow her laptop/take a short break while she runs the software she needs, I would just do that. Sometimes being in a relationship means you have to mildly inconvenience yourself to support your partner in an emergency; as long as it\u2019s not routine, and that goes both ways, it\u2019s not really a big deal.", "NTA. It's your laptop. If she wants to borrow it, nothing wrong with asking. But she can't assume it's always going to be a yes. And she can't do what she did here - decide she gets it and insist. And it's her responsibility to sort out her exam and software situation, not to assume that you'll be providing the solution on demand", "NTA, your education comes before a relationship. If this was so important to her, then she should go get a new laptop so she shouldn't have to worry about it in the future.", "NTA - I'm assuming that using her laptop isn't, for whatever reason, a viable option.

What's yours isn't mine until the wedding, luv, she should still be *asking* first.\n\nShe fucked up.\n\nThat being said - if this is a one off, if this is **not** a pattern of behaviour, then you're at a crossroads and should think carefully about what you're going to do.\n\nIf you want to continue the relationship, then you need to wiggle things so she can use your laptop for the period that she needs to **(with a real conversation about her respecting your time, possessions, and boundaries)**.\n\nIf you don't want to continue the relationship the relationship... well, no point in making a stand over a laptop, just dump her.\n\nBut seriously, poor planning on her part does not constitute an emergency on yours.\n\nYou will not be in the wrong if you don't let her use your laptop, but you will be single.", "NTAH- HER exams - HER RESPONSIBILITY.

He also says that she only has school once a week and has work twice a week, so there are four other days she could've worked on her exams. This is info he probably should've put in the main post, but it is several of the comments. Her poor planning is not his fault.", "I wouldn't leave work to a day before a deadline. \n\nLetting my gf use my laptop doesn't work for both of us though since it'll impact my revision", "I feel many commentors dont have good partnerships. If I messed up and had a deadline and needed my partners laptop they would support me and talk about how to make a plan so it didn't happen again. Even if it was annoying for them they'd swap laptops for a day. I couldn't imagine not supporting each other and helping each other out. Like this isn't some random friend or aquaintance - its your partner.", "I think this comment's in the wrong thread- judging from your comment section. \n\nAnyway, NTA for OP but it would be nice if he would let the gf use the laptop\n\nEta: just read that she could've used the laptop all week whilst OP was at work. GF is an adult and apparently needs to learn that actions have consequences", "what?", "I've never known a library allow you to download software onto their computers", "As soon as she realized her computer didn't have the software needed for her course she should've looked into renting one from her school. I've studied at a community college and a university, and both had device rental programs. She can also ask family or friends instead of hindering OP's studies with her poor planning.", "My study materials are saved on my laptop so I won't be able to access them on hers. Also I'll be using software that her laptop doesn't have so I wouldn't be able to use it. I work full time so don't have a lot of days where I get the full day to study so it's important for me to take the days when I get them", "Yeah she knew her laptop doesn't support the software. She uses my laptop when I'm t work when she needs it", "He did. She could have used it all week while he was at work (he was okay with this). Now he needs it and she wants it. Sounds like her actions have consequences", "So I'm selfish to want to use my own laptop to do my revision? My gf has known for a while that I was planning to revise all day tomorrow", "Right? Why are you being downvoted for this lol \n\nGf has fucked up, probably didn\u2019t realise she needed this particular software/that it needs to be compatible with her laptop and is now panicking. We\u2019ve all done that, especially with online exams things can sometimes just go wrong. \n\nWhen you\u2019re dating sometimes you have to compromise to support the other person when their need is more urgent than yours, which girlfriend\u2019s is in this case.\n\nWho are these perfect people y\u2019all are dating where they never make a mistake ever that causes you to have to inconvenience yourself slightly?", "A university library would likely have the software needed to complete whatever work the professors assign. Some universities (and even general libraries) also rent out laptops that may already have the software or be allowed to download it. Or, as others have suggested, she could have not waited until the very last minute to ask to borrow OP's laptop.", "So she has been using your laptop for her studies and now, shortly before her exams, you won't let her use it anymore?\n\nYTA"]}
