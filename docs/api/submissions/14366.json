She did not plan well nor take any steps to obtain the software she needs.

It seems she was planning on using your machine all along and is now taking it out on you when you refused. \n\nIt would seem that her plan going forward was to get you to sacrifice so that she would always get what she wanted.

It's not your fault or responsibility, but presumably you love her and want her to succeed, so figuring out a way she can get this last-minute shit done in this instance is the kind thing to do, and also a conversation that you won't let her lack of planning become your emergency in the future. Maybe some brainstorming on how to better coordinate (if you are willing to let her use your computer sometimes) and/or how she can better manage her deadlines. She doesn't need a lecture - she probably already knows she screwed the pooch here, but it would be best if y'all had some sort of plan going forward.", "INFO: can you use hers while she sits the one exam?\n\nFeels like a NAH situation to me. She thinks that you can share stuff in a pinch (which this presumably is, and I hope she\u2019s not usually this disorganised/has a pattern of expecting people to bail her out), and you don\u2019t (hope that that would swing both ways if you made a fuck up though.) \n\nIf you can borrow her laptop/take a short break while she runs the software she needs, I would just do that. Sometimes being in a relationship means you have to mildly inconvenience yourself to support your partner in an emergency; as long as it\u2019s not routine, and that goes both ways, it\u2019s not really a big deal.", "NTA. It's your laptop. If she wants to borrow it, nothing wrong with asking. But she can't assume it's always going to be a yes. And she can't do what she did here - decide she gets it and insist. And it's her responsibility to sort out her exam and software situation, not to assume that you'll be providing the solution on demand", "NTA, your education comes before a relationship. If this was so important to her, then she should go get a new laptop so she shouldn't have to worry about it in the future.", "NTA - I'm assuming that using her laptop isn't, for whatever reason, a viable option. OP is planning ahead for an upcoming deadline, while GF has left it to the last minute... and that, apparently, is somehow OP's problem...?", "NTA. She should have planned this in advance, checked for univeristy loaned devices, or gotten remote access to a device with the correct software.", "INFO: While I agree that you have first dibs on your own laptop when you both have deadlines, does the stuff you\u2019re doing require specialty software? In other words, would you be able to use her laptop?", "Unless she's trying to run cyberpunk on an Intel graphics chip then her laptop most definitely supports the software she just doesn't have it installed.", "NTA. Tell her *she* was inconsiderate to just assume your laptop was available for her use. What's yours isn't mine until the wedding, luv, she should still be *asking* first.\n\nShe fucked up.\n\nThat being said - if this is a one off, if this is **not** a pattern of behaviour, then you're at a crossroads and should think carefully about what you're going to do.\n\nIf you want to continue the relationship, then you need to wiggle things so she can use your laptop for the period that she needs to **(with a real conversation about her respecting your time, possessions, and boundaries)**.\n\nIf you don't want to continue the relationship the relationship... well, no point in making a stand over a laptop, just dump her.\n\nBut seriously, poor planning on her part does not constitute an emergency on yours.\n\nYou will not be in the wrong if you don't let her use your laptop, but you will be single.", "NTAH- HER exams - HER RESPONSIBILITY.
