Today I (23f) and my brother (16m) were going through some old boxes with childhood photos. In all this, we found our parents wedding DVD. \n\nFor a bit of background context, in 2015 when I was 15, and my brothers 8 and 9, our dad passed away suddenly in a car accident. Our mum took this very hard, and being the oldest sibling, and with my mothers already fragile mental health (her suffering from really bad depression approximately 3 years prior to my dads passing) I took on more of an adult role in the house. I can go on a lot about how hard it was, but I'm sure that's pretty self explanatory and will make this post much longer than what it'a about to be. I think it's also important to note that my dad wasn't a huge photo person, so we don't have all that many photos that aren't digital on a hard drive lost somewhere in our house, and absolutely no videos of him.\n\nSo, having been very excited that we found this video, my brother and I ran back to the house and put the dvd on. At this point our mum wasn't home so we thought this was fine. It was also really awesome for my brother to see our late grandma in these videos who was the one who named him before he was born, shorting before she had passed away. Especially because he's only ever seen about two different photos of her. Watching the videos we laughed at some funny bits, and cried a little over the obvious emotions this brought up. And honestly, I've struggled a lot lately with the realisation that there are little things that I'd begun to forget about my dad, like the sound of his laugh and voice, he's small facial expressions, body language, things like that which I guess you forget about when all you have are photos.\n\nThis video defiantly helped me with this a lot, and it's not really something I can bring up with my mum. I've tried talking to her sometimes when I'm going through rough stages, but she tends to put it off or change the subject. I remember once telling her I was really struggling, to which she kinda ignored me and then the next week booked my two younger brothers into therapy. To this day I don't think she's ever even asked me if I'm ok.\nAnyway, at one point my mum comes home, walks through the front door, sees what's on the tv and slams the door going to her room. My brother and I turned the video off and went to our rooms (our mum does not like being spoken to when she's upset, this often turns into her screaming at us or throwing things at us). After staying in my room for a hour or so I walked back out to see if my mum needed a hand with making dinner. Before I could open my mouth she began to yell at me about how it was a stupid idea for me to put the video on. Before I could say anything that I might regret I turned around and went back to my room. I can 100% understand that she may not want to see this video, so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685520319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wfylz/aita_for_playing_my_parents_wedding_video/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep the video safe; she might destroy it.", "NAH. It wasn\u2019t wrong for you to put on the movie, particularly if you weren\u2019t expecting her to be home. But it was obviously difficult for her, and she didn\u2019t react in the best way.

Your mother needs help to manage her grief and her anger and probably her depression.", "Oh dear! NAH backup that video NOW!  She's having flashbacks and needs a lot of therapy and still hasn't come to terms with your dad not being there.  She might destroy this one relic you have left that you and your brothers need.

I'm broke, this brought tears to my eyes thinking about my deceased father. \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA my dad died when I was 12 and we all grieved hard together for a long time. I still remember mum, my sister and I putting on music and wailing for want of a better word. It is the most agonising thing to live through... it shatters your world, but then you find moments to laugh or smile, and once you get over feeling guilty, life goes on. You own those memories, for yourself and your siblings. I'm sorry your mother couldn't own her pain and front up to it. But you do it for yourself and your siblings. Your dad's life deserves the remembering and the tears and the smiles. Protect that space. And let your mother do what she needs to survive her darkness. You are not responsible for it. It's ok to want to connect with memories. That's why we invest so much in preserving history, like in museums and libraries, because we want to preserve the memory of people or how something came about. This is your history and how you guys came about. Protect what is precious to you.", "NTA. This is your way for coping with grief too. For you and sibling to get to watch and see your dad again. It\u2019s unfair for you kids not to have the space to grieve. I understand that your mom is grieving and having a hard time but she is also forgetting that you all are too. I hope she is in therapy as well as you. You watching the video is appropriate. J would try and get a copy of it for yourselves too in case something happens to that dvd", "NTA to watch the video but your mom has not been there for you and is an abusive person it seems if she will yell at or throw things at her kids when she is upset. I think you have a right to see photos and videos of your father.", "NTA, your mother is being cruel and neglectful to you.

It sounds like she never gave you the space to grieve.  It's abusive.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And I *cannot* 100% understand why she does not want to see the video. Sure, it will tear open wounds, but at the same time it brings back fond memories (I hope) and help to get over the pain. You don't throw away all the pictures of someone who died, do you? \n\nUnless the marriage was a disaster, she hated her husband, the wedding day was not a success...\n\nBut then, still, why wouldn't the children not be allowed to see the wedding video of their parents?\n\nYour mother sounds very unhinged and in need of some serious therapy. Is there any chance, considering your age, that you could move out and live on yourself, perhaps taking your brothers with you? A mother getting upset about little things and then throwing stuff does not sound very safe to me.", "Poor OP has been carrying the mental and emotional load for her family since she was 15. She deserves to see a video of her dad alive. She deserves to see a video of her grandmother. She deserves to see a time when her mom was happy. \n\nI empathize with her mom's grief, but these kids effectively lost both of their parents in 2015 and at some point their emotional well-being has to come before hers.", "I had to scroll way too far down to see this.", "Moms the AH here. for little things and big.\n\n1. YOU expressed how you felt and were hurt and she signed your siblings up for therapy, completely neglecting you and your feelings that you JUST told her.\n2. yelling at you is normal if you broke a lamp. ya know. a loud little \"wtf were you kids even doing?\" or something... but all the time? no ma'am\n3. THROWING SHIT AT YALL! NO\n4. Not getting herself into therapy to proved a safe and nurturing home for you and your siblings.\n\nYou're not TA OP. You're the result of parentification through grief.

It would be a terrible shock to walk in and suddenly hear a dead spouse's voice unexpectedly. \n\nYou and your brother's deserve to watch these videos and talk about your Dad whenever you want to.

Ur mother might be upset over it, and I get that, but u youse as the kids are the 1s that are also suffering and should be able to watch the DVD whenever u want. \n\n Also, just FYI, u will NEVER forget the little things about ur dad!

I lost my nanna over 10 yrs ago now and i can still remember hear her laugh and voice when i want to, i can still see her rolling her eyes at me and i can still tell how our conversations would go if she was still alive today.

This isn't about her not wanting to see the video, you were watching when she was not there and you didn't insist on keeping it on when she arrived.  This is about her not wanting you to see the video even though it obviously means a lot to you.  That's the AH behavior.", "NTA. Your mother is completely irresponsible and not a mother to you.

Take care of yourself. That means make sure you get support, therapy, or whatnot. Get someone who will be on your team.", "Ya it's oddly only put in brackets in the middle of the story.
