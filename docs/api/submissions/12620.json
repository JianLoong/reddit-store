You would be an asshole, but it would make sense.\n\nIf you do actually care about her and want her to be happy, then you are an inexplicable asshole.

We don't know what she said when OP asked about bowling for her birthday. It could have been \"Yes, sounds awesome\", \"No, let's do something else\", \"Hmm, maybe, I'll have to think about it\", \"I dunno... I don't really want to think about this right now, I've got too much shit going on with my brother\", whatever. Any response that's not a very clear, concise \"Yes, and you need to promptly book the bowling appointment, or \"No\" can be very confusing or misleading for people like us. I can tell you I wouldn't know what exactly my girlfriend would be hoping for/expecting, if she was depressed around her birthday, so clear communication between both individuals is extremely important.\n\nI need people to be clear and to the point, in a gentle way. That's how I thrive. I have trouble telling when people are lying, or when they're saying something that is suggesting something else that I'm supposed to pick up on. Inferring shit is fucking hard. It's entirely possible that the girlfriend had an answer that she felt was clear, but wasn't clear for the OP. And it's hard knowing what your partner wants when they're in a bad state of mind, like the girlfriend apparently was. And it can definitely be harder talking to your partner to try and find out what exactly it is they want and need, when they're severely depressed and agitated. Stuff gets lost in translation. Again, I'm saying this from my perspective as someone with Autism with a partner who's depressed all the time. \n\nI also struggle with not completely quickly taking in new information, and needing a lot of repitition before stuff starts to truly sink in. It sucks, and I wish it wasn't this way, but it tends to come with the Autism package. Could be the same case for the OP. \n\n\nI'm sure some neurotypical people will read this post and be like, \"Autism is no excuse. It is OBVIOUS that you should plan a special event for your girlfriend's birthday, even if she doesn't prompt you to do so. This is weaponized incompetence!\"\n\nAnd my response is something like, trust me, I WISH shit like this was easier to pick up on and was obvious. I'm sorry you can't understand, but you have a big social advantage over me, and I've been fighting through this my whole life, trying to improve, while gradually making progress. Also, a lot of stuff becomes obvious in RETROSPECT, but you just don't pick up on until it's too late.\n\nAnd there might also be Autistic people reading this post saying, \"I'm Autistic and this is still no excuse. It still should have been obvious to the OP to book a bowling appointment\". \n\nAnd my response to that would be something like, well you've apparently got your shit together better than the OP and I do, and that's awesome. I hope that in time, I can get to where you're at. \n\nIn summary, I made this post in defense of the OP, under the assumption they're Autistic. OP isn't entirely without fault, but it's a situation I could potentially see myself in, especially a few years ago, earlier in my relationship.\n\nAnd of course, once again, it's also possible none of this shit applies, and the OP is just an asshole. Who knows.
