She's very difficult to cheer up and just wants to keep talking about this argument with her brother.\n\nAnyway, she's now bringing it up that she always organises and books something for my birthday. She has always booked something and makes the days fun. She is also telling me she always bakes me a cake, and had organised me a surprise party with all my friends a few years ago. She's throwing these things in my face and she's angry that i have never given her a birthday cake.\n\nSShe seems to be forgetting that i never ask for these things and i'm not very good at organising things.

YTA", "this is giving me the \u201ci dont know why she left me, it completely blind sided me. i did everything right\u201d   vibes\n\ndoesn\u2019t plan anything for his girlfriends birthday and wonders why she\u2019s upset. your weaponized incompetence and lack of empathy for your girlfriend is wild to me.\n\nthe fight with her brother has made her upset for weeks which is a perfect indication to plan something for her bday to cheer her up because she\u2019s your girlfriend and you love her (this post makes me think other wise tbh) and genuinely even if there wasn\u2019t a fight with her brother before hand, her birthday should be a special day about her and what she wants to do. your \u201clack of organizing\u201d is a cop out. do better or i truly hope she finds someone better", "Hope your girlfriend breaks up with you.\nYTA", "This problem is going to fix itself  very soon. SHE is going  to dump YOU. And then you can post about how you have no idea what went  wrong, she never said anything....", "YTA, clearly. Your girlfriend deserves someone who will support her through this tough time and will reciprocate the love/effort she shows you. From this post, you have done neither.", "YTA \n\nI understand being hesitant to plan something because she was in mood and you\u2019re not sure she\u2019ll be up for it, but worse case scenario you have to cancel a reservation. \n\nIt\u2019s very clear that you have two different love languages, but you don\u2019t get a pass for pleading ignorance considering how long you\u2019ve been together.", "YTA. \n\nSo she\u2019s going through a hard time. This is when you make sure to celebrate her. \n\nYou\u2019re not good at organizing things? Well I guess you\u2019re too incompetent to have a partner then. \n\nYou were heartless and lazy and selfish. \n\nShe\u2019s been difficult to cheer up? Maybe because you don\u2019t bother showing her she\u2019s worth your time", "yta do you even like her lol", "YTA. Just because your gf is having a hard time at the moment doesn't mean you get to ignore her birthday. In fact in a loving relationship it should (usually) mean the opposite! When I'm having a rough time, my partner goes out of their way to arrange nice things for us to do/ways to spend time together. If a rough period coincided with my birthday, they'd pay *more* attention to the day than usual. I'm not saying you should go for a grand gesture expensive party or anything like that, just spend some time listening to your gf and actually thinking about what she's telling you, and then find a way to make her feel cared for.", "YTA \n\nYou can't even buy a cake or make a reservation ? Are you not an adult? You had the bowling idea, just follow through", "YTA.  Doesn't matter that *you* don't want anything special for your birthday.  *She* clearly wants you to do something special for hers.  You told her about bowling, then didn't schedule it, but neglected to tell her.  No cake, no gift, nothing.  Yeah, YTA.", "You're not good at organizing things - do you know how to make a dinner reservation?  Do you know how to go to the bakery and buy a cake?  Do you know how to purchase flowers?  You can purchase tickets for a play or any number of things.", "YTA.\n\nEven if you weren't sure if she would have wanted to go out (which, you could have asked her), why not order her a cake and make a spa day at home and treat her like a queen? It would have been fun, cheap, and easy to do. There's simply no excuse for this OP.", "YTA, you dont love her, that isn\u2019t love.", "Slight YTA, its not hard to get a reservation. You could have also taken here out to eat and had the restaurant bring her a piece of cake.", "NTA. I think some people put way too high of expectations on birthdays. There may need to be a bit more communication on her side of what she needs or wants from you. Ex. \u201cHey babe, I\u2019d love it if you\u2019d take me out for dinner (or give me an excuse to wear a dress, or night out with us and friends\u2026) for my birthday\u201d. When a person sets up a huge fantasy in their mind of exactly what they want to happen without communicating anything and the other person guesses wrong- they\u2019ll always be disappointed. \n\nThat said, a good read is, \u201cThe 5 Love Languages\u201d. It describes most people showing and receiving love in 1 of 5 ways (sometimes a couple or few). It makes a good point explaining for some it\u2019s showing affection, others receiving gifts, quality time together, acts of service\u2026and it\u2019s insightful to consider that what you consider showing/receiving love is different than what hers is.", "YTA she didn't need to be wined and dined but dang man a little thought may had been nice.", "Yta", "YTA\n\nIf you cared enough, you'd try. You don't ask for the special things she does to make you feel loved, and she still does them!! She asks and still can't get 1/2 of what she gives!! She is hurt you don't WANT to make her feel special.", "Ugh. She needs to just leave your inconsiderate, incompetent ass. YTA", "YTA you\u2019re a grown man, I assume you\u2019ve managed to organise yourself a job, probably projects, a rental or a property, a car, holidays. All of which are harder than booking a meal and an activity and some flowers and cake.", "YTA. Stop being bad at organising things and give her a birthday thrill like she does for you.", "Also he says he never asked for those things but seemingly enjoyed the benefit of them and didn\u2019t ask her to stop", "She's hard to cheer up...\n\nWhich is code for- I don't like having to deal with her when she isn't happy and making my life easier. And since I'm not good at organizing things, when she haz the sadz, she doesn't do anything for meeeee, so why should I bother with her birthday????", "I agree, my thought was, \"Look up Weaponized Incompetence!\"", "This. I think there's a way to salvage this, but OP's probably not willing to put in the work. A grand gesture, a do-over birthday where he goes over the top, cake, gifts, flowers, a nice dinner, maybe dancing if GF is into it. It MAY work. And, of course, actually put in the work in the future.", "Heck, you can even ask reddit for ideas. Just like you just asked reddit if you were TA. Just saying.", "I may be bad at organizing, but at least I'm not bad at taking criticism like a champ.", "This !", "Less than 5 min!", "I am very interested in getting the breakdown here as well. \n\nGoogle a bakery.\n\nCall bakery.\n\nOrder cake in a flavor she likes. \n\nPick up cake. \n\nOh, I forgot!--gather 1 knife, 2 forks and 2 plates. \n\nSoooo hard.", "Well, he\u2019s very patiently waiting for her to cheer up enough to start doing kind and thoughtful things for him again \ud83d\ude44", "i\u2019m weak \ud83d\udc80", "my boyfriend doesn\u2019t even celebrate birthdays and holidays yet he manages to buy me treats and book reservations for my birthday because he cares. op doesn\u2019t care about his gf which is evident about how he spoke about her crying. \n\ni hope she leaves and finds someone supportive bc it sounds like she\u2019s going through it", "This does sound like someone who could be depressed\u2026 or have an adhd brain\u2026 *Not an excuse, just looking for more context.", "You\u2019re right. He could\u2019ve literally played her favorite song in the car to be sweet.", "Good for you! That's awesome you were able to recognize those patterns and walk away.", "Lmao. I'm sure OP could do it for something he found important. Fucking weaponized incompetence strikes again. \"Oh I couldn't do the bare minimum for your birthday because I'm baaaaad at it.\" You're not bad at it, you just don't care and couldn't be bothered. \n\nYTA, OP.", "don\u2019t understand how it can possibly NAH when he is clearly using the excuse of not needing to return her thoughtfulness on his birthdays by saying \u201cshe seems to be forgetting that i never asked\u201d", "you\u2019re gross", "be fr", "you think it\u2019s bad of her to hold those over his head, but it\u2019s alright for him to do nothing for his girlfriend who has clearly been upset for a while now and then, to make the lamest excuses about it? alright", "Yep. And if she stops he'll feel put upon and abused because she's just punishing him for not being good at birthdays", "He won\u2019t look it up, too much work\u2026", "He would but he\u2019s not good at googling things", "That won't work. She will think he's only doing it because she got upset at him. \n\n\nIt comes down to - she doesn't think he cares. If actions speak louder than words, he's spoken loud and clear.", "Was gonna say! Don't know how this guy even has a job if he can't do what is essentially basic admin.", "It\u2019s even easier than that. Most grocery stores have ready made cakes. The bar is really that low. \n\nBut you know, hE\u2019S nOt GoOD aT OrgAnISing\n\nYTA OP. And you\u2019re not earning brownie points with weaponized incompetence.", "Bakery isn't even necessary! Most grocery stores in America sell decent cakes! No thought or planning requirements. Incredible!!! Besides the forks and knife I suppose", "What are the odds he knows what flavor cake she likes.", "I do want to mention, some people have mad phone call anxiety. Even then, there are many ways to order a dessert item(s) online, without ever picking up the phone. Just wanted to validate some of my homies that haaaate talking on the phone.", "Exactly. Making someone feel special is very easy. It is never out of budget. But it does take TIME! OP, you could\u2019ve gotten her a card from the dollar store and made that special. If you have phone call anxiety, making a reservation on \u201cOpen Table\u201d is super easy. You need to do some groveling.", "You're a nicer person than I am. I was thinking more along the lines of a narcissist", "fr", "He\u2019ll just ask his mom about it.", "Can't she do it for him she's so much better at google.", "Best comment!", "I keep checking to see if Reddit has reinstated the free awards for comments like these.", "Well, yeah, because that's exactly what it is. But he needs to do damage control. Doing this, and making sure he makes more of an effort in the future will show her he does care. Like I said, he probably won't. But it's up to him to prove to her that he has learned his lesson, and this would be a step in the right direction.", "Or he could've bought cupcakes and then noooo utensils!", "But like you said, many many bakeries have online ordering capabilities, and many grocery stores have pre-made cakes you can go in and grab for like\u2026.$5 or $10", "He would have done, but his mum was busy, and he didn\u2019t know if she would be able to chat anyway, so he didn\u2019t bother."]}
