My brothers and I wanted to go to college, but didn't have the money to buy our books. So, dad and I co-signed for a credit card. \nI worked full time and went to school part-time. Dad told me he was using my paychecks to pay off the card. I still lived at home because it was cheaper than rooms on campus and we only lived 5 miles away.\nI got married at 25, asked my dad how much I still owe him for the card. He said it was paid off, so I told him to cancel it.\nHe didn't, he had even some how gotten my card and had both in his possession. \nSkip up to a few years ago, both my parents die in a car accident  and said credit card company comes knocking on my door.\nDemanding that I pay the balance,  which if I don't , they will take everything I have. \nI asked for proof of use and was given a statement of purchases. My wife and I sat at the table and tried not to pick up the phone and scream at my siblings. \nThey had used it for my older brother's  honeymoon, vacations, medicine, gas, groceries..you name it! \nI called my older brother and asked him wth? He said, and I quote,\" I'm still paying for the funeral which was 15k.\"\nHow does 15k compare to the 65k plus that is owed on a card that I have not used since I was 22!\nI can't talk to them, our friends say that they are acting like they are the victim.  \nAITA for refusing to allow them into my life?\nUpdate: 1\nThe credit card with my name on it was used for everything. \nMy father's card was hardly ever used,  because they could try to \" copy\" my handwriting.  Which, upon seeing their signature and mine proves that I did not have the card because of how far off the signatures were.\nAlso, I saw how my parents used credit cards and my aunts and uncles. I vowed to pay cash for anything I want or wait until I can afford it.  Only recently did we buy a house.\nUpdate: 2\nMy siblings are telling everyone that I am the problem and that they are the victim.  Also, that I used the card. I moved away, almost an hour, how could I possibly use it?\nUpdate: 3 My spouse had to sign for the house,  because of my credit.\nUpdate: 4 when I asked my dad about the balance and he said that it was paid off.  He said that he would cancel it.

You should talk to a lawyer about how to proceed, but it's not as simple as \"they will take everything you have\".\n\nThere will be questions to answer, such as, were you not getting statements on the credit card? Did you really not know what your parents were charging to the account?", "NTA\n\nIANAL but if it is legal, I'd sue them for the amount of debt they put you in, minus the amount for the funeral, plus the amount of interest owed.

Call the credit card company and report the charges as fraud.  That card with it being a joint account should have been closed once your father passed away due to probate.   You will need to turn your sibling\u2019s in for fraud though.  I would suggest getting legal representation as they are technically representing a deceased person.  My question to you is since it was a joint account was the card they were using in your name or your dads specifically.   Reason I ask is credit cards can track as the name has to match the card.  The purchases like the trips can be linked back to the name on the tickets (when I had my identity stolen we could see the name they used in the airline ticket)   Good luck and hope you get this resolved.", "NTA, but you should look for legal representation.", "NTA, clearly.

You're really lucky this hasn't ruined your credit. That's a gigantic amount of debt to be carrying.\n\nIf your brother wanted you pay half for the funeral, he should've asked. I agree with everyone that you should look into your legal rights. I've never had a co-signed credit card, so I don't know what to say but better look into it in case there is a way to get out of it.", "NTA. But you need to lock down your credit and file for fraud.

You can check your credit score for free a hundred different ways-and you never noticed this card with 65k on it????? You\u2019ve learned a hard lesson about not doing follow up on a credit card that you took out with someone else. If you didn\u2019t know your parents were using/abusing your credit, why would your siblings know?  Maybe you all need to calm down and have a rational conversation about all the debt-funeral and credit card, before you starting assigning who the asshole is, bc it sounds like that person is no longer living.
