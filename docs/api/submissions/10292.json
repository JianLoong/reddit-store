My brothers and I wanted to go to college, but didn't have the money to buy our books. So, dad and I co-signed for a credit card. \nI worked full time and went to school part-time. Dad told me he was using my paychecks to pay off the card. I still lived at home because it was cheaper than rooms on campus and we only lived 5 miles away.\nI got married at 25, asked my dad how much I still owe him for the card. He said it was paid off, so I told him to cancel it.\nHe didn't, he had even some how gotten my card and had both in his possession. \nSkip up to a few years ago, both my parents die in a car accident  and said credit card company comes knocking on my door.\nDemanding that I pay the balance,  which if I don't , they will take everything I have. \nI asked for proof of use and was given a statement of purchases. My wife and I sat at the table and tried not to pick up the phone and scream at my siblings. \nThey had used it for my older brother's  honeymoon, vacations, medicine, gas, groceries..you name it! \nI called my older brother and asked him wth? He said, and I quote,\" I'm still paying for the funeral which was 15k.\"\nHow does 15k compare to the 65k plus that is owed on a card that I have not used since I was 22!\nI can't talk to them, our friends say that they are acting like they are the victim.  \nAITA for refusing to allow them into my life?\nUpdate: 1\nThe credit card with my name on it was used for everything. \nMy father's card was hardly ever used,  because they could try to \" copy\" my handwriting.  Which, upon seeing their signature and mine proves that I did not have the card because of how far off the signatures were.\nAlso, I saw how my parents used credit cards and my aunts and uncles. I vowed to pay cash for anything I want or wait until I can afford it.  Only recently did we buy a house.\nUpdate: 2\nMy siblings are telling everyone that I am the problem and that they are the victim.  Also, that I used the card. I moved away, almost an hour, how could I possibly use it?\nUpdate: 3 My spouse had to sign for the house,  because of my credit.\nUpdate: 4 when I asked my dad about the balance and he said that it was paid off.  He said that he would cancel it.  I believed my dad, but I guess I should have done it,  I trusted my dad.", "created_utc": 1676740749, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115k85v/aita_i_dont_want_to_pay_for_my_siblings_honeymoon/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should talk to a lawyer about how to proceed, but it's not as simple as \"they will take everything you have\".\n\nThere will be questions to answer, such as, were you not getting statements on the credit card? Did you really not know what your parents were charging to the account?", "NTA\n\nIANAL but if it is legal, I'd sue them for the amount of debt they put you in, minus the amount for the funeral, plus the amount of interest owed.  So that's about, what, 50K, plus interest.  Given an average credit card APR is around 30%, that could easily amount to more than the principal.\n\nYou never agreed to any of that, nor did they ask your permission even to use the card.  You didn't even **know** they had the card.\n\nAnd I would **never** allow them into your life, except in court.\n\nOf course they'll whine about being the \"victims.\"  What else would they do?  Own what they did, like mature adults, and work out a reasonable payment plan for the debt?\n\nThat would require them to not be giant AH's.", "NTA.   Call the credit card company and report the charges as fraud.  That card with it being a joint account should have been closed once your father passed away due to probate.   You will need to turn your sibling\u2019s in for fraud though.  I would suggest getting legal representation as they are technically representing a deceased person.  My question to you is since it was a joint account was the card they were using in your name or your dads specifically.   Reason I ask is credit cards can track as the name has to match the card.  The purchases like the trips can be linked back to the name on the tickets (when I had my identity stolen we could see the name they used in the airline ticket)   Good luck and hope you get this resolved.", "NTA, but you should look for legal representation.", "NTA, clearly. You need to contact the credit card company and report fraudulent use. And yes, that will cause legal trouble for them, and no, you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about that.", "NTA. You're really lucky this hasn't ruined your credit. That's a gigantic amount of debt to be carrying.\n\nIf your brother wanted you pay half for the funeral, he should've asked. I agree with everyone that you should look into your legal rights. I've never had a co-signed credit card, so I don't know what to say but better look into it in case there is a way to get out of it.", "NTA. But you need to lock down your credit and file for fraud. Contact a lawyer to see how you can fight this.", "NTA. File a police report because this is clearly fraud.", "From your other posts it looks like this happened years ago. If so, the credit card company probably discharged the debt after 7 years and sold it to a collections agency. \n\nDO NOT PAY THEM ANYTHING.

This is fraud.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'd be on my way to court for them fraudulently using the card. Their names were not on it.", "Who's  name is is the credit card if you and dad were co- signers ?\n\nIf it was in dad's name, and it was used after, then you should  dispute the charges.", "NTA but contact the credit card company and let them know that these purchases were unauthorized. They might be able to help out.", "NTA lawyer up and fight this. Your dad committed fraud. Legal fees are expensive but 65k will wreck you", "A lot of people suck here. You can check your credit score for free a hundred different ways-and you never noticed this card with 65k on it????? You\u2019ve learned a hard lesson about not doing follow up on a credit card that you took out with someone else. If you didn\u2019t know your parents were using/abusing your credit, why would your siblings know?  Maybe you all need to calm down and have a rational conversation about all the debt-funeral and credit card, before you starting assigning who the asshole is, bc it sounds like that person is no longer living.
