We are very fortunate to have friends and family happy to give us their old clothes and items when their children outgrow them, and so despite me being on a very low income he doesn't go without.\n\nLast Christmas I noticed that he was starting to just tip out all his toys and then trip over, get upset, or just want to sit down. I looked things up and realised he was probably overwhelmed and not able to play because there was just too much stuff to the point it just became mess and clutter. So I tried to say no thankyou to presents and redirect relatives to buy size up clothing, books or experiences for him but almost everyone still bought toys and items which just added to the stuff. I got very frustrated with Easter just passed, when multiple people have him gifts (Easter isn't a gift giving holiday!!!) Knowing that I was already struggling with the stuff from Christmas. And so, I have requested no gifts for his upcoming birthday. Despite it being awkward I have told people that he has a savings account which will go towards his one day tertiary study, car or house.\n\nLast night I was at his grandma's house (father's mother) and she mentioned \"I know you said no gifts but I got him something, hope you don't mind\" with a grin. In the politest way possible I said thankyou but I'm really running out of space. Then his aunt said a similar thing. Then his step mum again \"you said no gifts but...\" And I was like seriously? You all know we live in a tiny place and it's really overwhelming. \n\nShe said I was being ungrateful, I am cruel to expect a 2 year old to get nothing for his birthday, taking that experience and excitement from him, and I should just clear out his old toys when he's not looking. I honestly think they're being assholes by disrespecting my boundary, and expecting me to deal with his tantrums from having too much stuff, work out how to clean or store it all, and make him give away his things to make room!

Say it nicely but firmly. \n\n2) Tell them that all the toys they give will need to stay at their house. It'll be great because every time you take him over there, he'll have new toys to play with!\n\n3) If you have a partner, they need to back you up on this. You must present a united front.", "NTA.\n\nLook as a relative its soo nice to see a little one get a new toy from you and be so very, happy, excited and appreciative. But that's not the reality of your situation. I'm sure they dont want to be the one responsible for forcing a little one to pick between a bunch if toys that he loves.\n\nAs your family doesn't seem to want to gift practical items because your son won't be excited in the same way, maybe you could try experiences instead? Son doesn't want any new toys because he has enough, but he really wants to go to the zoo/disneyland/holiday/magic show. Could you help us to fund that?", "NTA, not at all.  I had a similar issue and also tried to have no-gift-birthdays.  You are NOT being cruel or mean, do not let them bs you - you are being practical.  I think older relatives have the hardest time with the idea of no gifts.  It worked better with our younger relatives - they were happy to give books and experiences (art classes, a train ride, zoo pass, etc.) One option for you - think of donating some of the gifts.  Childrens ward at the hospital, or a local day care would love your extra things.", "nta. cruel to a 2 yr to get nothing for a bday? A 2 year old doesn't care, they're like cats, they'll play more with the box that the toy came in than  the actual toy. I'd say either stand up to them and tell them you won't be accepting any gifts or take them and donate them to a children's charity.", "My daughter just turned 2 twelve days ago and she got exactly 0 gifts from me... granted we're in a situation of not having a place to live right now, but still. Even if we did, for me it was buying her an experience. We got pizza and went to an arcade, and had cake and she had a BLAST. Very often she gets overwhelmed or doesn't care about her toys. So others can send them and I focus on the experiences and core memories. She does not hate me for this. \n\nNTA, don't let others make it seem like you're being selfish. I do think the donation to the account is a bit much; but you still gave other options too. If anything you could make a wishlist on somewhere like Amazon or elsewhere of things he does need or whatnot, that helps usually. Or give ideas on things to do (tickets to the zoo, to the aquarium, to a learning museum, etc). If they're still disrespecting it, then honey they are most definitely the AH.", "Its weird how \"No toys\" turns into \"No gifts at all\" when you provided alternate suggestions of gifts such as books and contributions for your sons college fund. \n\nBut INFO also what happens if a bunch of folks end up sending books?

Have they been made aware the sheer amount is overwhelming to your son and is not just a \"I don't want to have to deal with organization?\"  Either way, they're still kinda being disrespectful since you asked for no gifts, but it sounds like from their perspective, it may look like a two year old is being deprived of toys because mom is tired of cleaning. Definitely not saying that's the case, but how much have they been told?", "NTA I\u2019m sorry nobody in the family is listening to you. Have you explained that he gets overstimulated when presented with too many options? \n\nI have a similar situation and my little one never grew out if it. She\u2019s 6 now and still gets overstimulated by clutter and too many options. I am lucky that I do have ONE relative that just gives cash to put into her college fund. And an aunt that always gives books, which she LOVES. She\u2019s excited to get presents, sure, but then they never even get touched. She got a cool present for Christmas and has played with it one time and that was only because a playmate came over and wanted to play with it with her.", "NTA. \n\nYou'll get pushback.\n\nI argued with my mom about this for a few years when my kids were small.

You told them no toys and you told them why, I agree with some of the comments I\u2019ve seen a bout donating them and I like the idea you mentioned in your post about financial gifts going to his college fund/savings. That said, it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re being malicious by getting him toys it\u2019s just not getting through to them that it\u2019s just clutter that they\u2019re gifting, which must be really frustrating. Maybe you could try more firmly outlining why they really shouldn\u2019t give him toys?

It will stop him getting overwhelmed with to many toys and the excitement of new toys every couple of months is worth it even though they are just his other toys it feel like something new to him. Nta presents at that age are over rated maybe asked for toy gift cards so you can get some toys as he grows and put them into circulation.", "NTA\\INFO. no toys <> no gifts. which one is it. Excess toys can be left and gradmas house for all the times you'll be coming over to play.", "Don\u2019t ask people to contribute to his college fund.

As a person who firmly believes in less toys or only developmental toys and a little bit of here and there, I believe you have the right to actually tell them no. Maybe for next time just make a card for holidays. All possible holiday's and say no gifts . And to your near and dear ones ask them to contribute to college fund. \n\nI mean this is so amazing. Your idea. Instead of filling dumps with garbage that your child will outgrow in a few months, the money even if 10 15 dollars will go a long way. It might mean a hot meal on a difficult day. \n\nI have a young niece and the amount of plastic I see with in her toy closet makes my blood boil. But she ain't my child and her mother is fulfilling some childhood fantasy as she didn't have much toys. How difficult it is for grown ass people to understand that this is not the future for your child.\n\nEvery plastic toy you buy , the child might outgrow it soon esp in young ages and it's going to a fill. Sorry for being a sour puss. But a 2 yr old doesn't know much and hence we should be the ones (the parents) to actually take care of it and teach them not to be potential hoarders lol.", "No space I understand. But not all gifts take up space. Going to a water park or carnival or something like that costs money, is fun and takes up no space afterwards.", "mild YTA because you have discovered you can't stop the madness. You can be the mom though - and for every new toy that is given, one goes away to charity. Even if they are age appropriate and still in good condition.\n\nOther than that, you could try to come up with some vertical storage solutions.", "YTA you don't want to deal with his tantrums. He's 2 years old. Terrible twos ever heard of it. You are taking away his experience. What kind of mother wants her kid to sit there on his birthday and not get presents. Cycle out his older toys its what every parent does. Easter is a gift giving holiday its usually small gifts in a basket along with chocolate. You should be so grateful your child has loving and gift giving people in his life. Some kids don't have that.", "Mild ESH.  Your relatives are definitely being shitty to you and violating the very clear boundary you set.  Right now it's cluttered toys, but they are also demonstrating that if they think something is part of a \"normal childhood\", they're just going to do it whether you want them to or not.\n\nHowever, they are also right.  Getting so frustrated over clutter that you declare no gifts for your kids birthday is a non sustainable solution, and yes it will definitely impact your kid.\n\nTo everyone saying \"he's only two he won't remember this\".  You're right, he won't remember it, which is why it will be confusing and frightening to him that birthdays and clutter give him anxiety as an adult.  The shit that happens to us as infants and toddlers MATTERS.  Things like what the OP described aren't isolated incidents that don't connect to anything else in life.  If OP is that frustrated with the situation, it is guaranteed to change their behavior in countless ways they won't even notice, but their kid definitely will.\n\nYou haven't done anything egregious or awful, but you're going to need to figure out a better solution before he turns 3, and to have a serious and explicit talk with your relatives about boundaries and your kid.  I'd also encourage you to think about your own relationship with the idea of \"clutter\".", "YTA, nobody HAS to get your son anything. You can make suggestions of what would be more helpful, but at the end of the day, it's their money and you're sounding very entitled.\n\nAlso, speaking as someone who once was a kid, it's really disappointing to get a cash donation or an educational book for your birthday. I get that the clutter is stressing you out, but seriously just take an hour before the holiday and throw a bunch of crap in a donation bag.\n\nHow is a book less clutter?", "ESH - Why don\u2019t you just donate all his toys away? That way your house doesn\u2019t get cluttered up and your son doesn\u2019t get overwhelmed with new amounts of toys. Or at very least have a yard sale or something similar and sell them. \n\nAsking people to contribute financially to your son\u2019s account seems a bit awkward. I understand the clothes part though.", "YTA Also, IDK what country you're in but yeah, Easter is a gift holiday where I live (although at that age it's mostly candy). Look, you can always donate the gifts if your son doesn't like them or play with them. Just take it and say thank you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's why I plan to have a kid's basketball hoop at my house for my nephew to play with when he comes over, since my yard is much more spacious than the one at nephew's home. \n\nIf grandma really wanted to get something for the kid, clothing is a thing.

I will give some ideas if you want to give them new ideas of present ideas BUT first of all, it\u2019s totally unnecessary if you want to continue saying no to it all. This is just some alternatives. \n\nPeople love giving fun gifts to kids though. Since you\u2019re getting pushback I\u2019d try a few things. One, suggest if they get a big toy, they keep it at theirs. My parents have done this and while sometimes my kids are sad it doesn\u2019t come home with us, they really enjoy knowing grandma has a cool truck or whatever waiting for them. Plus you can talk it up when you\u2019re going there for a visit and your kid doesn\u2019t want to go. \n\nSecond, maybe they could give your son experiences. A zoo or museum pass is the BEST gift ever. No stuff, super fun, saves you money. Take your son to the park with a special picnic, go on a train ride, etc etc. \n\nFinally. If they really want to give you things and won\u2019t listen (and you want to find a compromise which you don\u2019t have to do). Consumable gifts. Like art supplies for example. Chalk, paints, markers, paper. We have 1-2 art bins in our home and we use that stuff up frequently. It can be super fun to get new supplies and they can feel like toys but their purpose is to be used. My kids also love things like sticker books or maze books or just drawing notebooks to use. Pretty journals. Etc.", "JFC... NTA.  Thank them and then gift them to someone else.  If they ask where the toys are later, tell them you didn't have room for them.

Telling people not to buy toys is a making a rule about what kind of gifts others can give your son. You can make a rule about that but don\u2019t expect people to like it and don\u2019t be surprised if they think you\u2019re an AH for insisting.

Clean up all the junk and get it out (how do kids manage to get pieces of paper stuffed behind their beds?), have him help dust down surfaces, even if you have to hold him up to have him \u201chelp.\u201d At this time, have him go through his toys and identify ones he doesn\u2019t want any more and tell him up front he will be giving them away to a child who doesn\u2019t have as much as he has.  At his age, you hold up a toy and ask if he still plays with it.  If he seems even remotely attached, he keeps it.  When he\u2019s 2, it may only be one toy he\u2019s ready to give away, but as he gets older, he\u2019ll get into the spirit of things and will voluntarily pull out the toys he doesn\u2019t want.  After you have a pile, you discretely check to make sure they are in decent condition to give away and throw out anything that\u2019s not.  It\u2019s a win-win situation; you start to teach your son how to give and you keep his toy collection manageable.\n\n(Some people also have their children give away one toy for every new one they get.  I had my kids do the Clean Up method because sometimes the toys they wanted to give away were the new ones.  You\u2019ll note it was their choice, not mine.  I wanted them to learn how to make decisions for themselves.)", "We essentially do number 2 because we can't fit the majority of toys other people purchase for him, at our home. I like to buy my son toys myself so I prioritize room for them since I'm with him to know what he wants versus the random crap from xyz that he might enjoy for ten minutes. This has helped cut down on the random toy clutter, and has forced people to be more thoughtful and conscious about what kind of toys they give. My kid has 50 million construction vehicles, at grammys house because I don't need more to trip over. He also his own four wheeler there now too, the fancy kitchen set, all the random flash cards, 15 different bottles of bubbles....", "4) suggest giving experience gifts instead, a season pass to the zoo, aquarium, pool, gymnastics or swimming lessons (bonus if they are able to take the kid themselves)", "When my kids where little I convinced both sides of the family to do big gift contributions. I suggested they donate what ever they where spending on the kids. It didn\u2019t have to be a set amount and we where able to buy outdoor playhouses, swing sets, one year everyone donated stuff and we took them to a zoo. It was such a big hit with the family becuase I sent pic of the kids enjoying thier stuff that this continues as they got older. As they got older they got trampolines, swimming pools, ball goals, and more trips. The kids loved it. The grand parents loved it. And I didn\u2019t have a dozen toys lowing everywhere.\n\nThe only problem was they wanted to still get something small for them when they where under the age of 6. So I started suggesting books. I would read to them.

She's currently upset because I won't \"let\" her buy a toddler-sized chair-and-table set - there is, very literally, nowhere for that to go.\n\nAll of this is to say - my two-year old's birthday was \"no gifts please!,\" people mostly listened, and it was amazing (and he truly did not know the difference).", "Oh my god you are living my dream.

You need to figure out shipping and she prob wouldn't make much money off them after commission and packing materials. Our parents happily give checks for the college fund.

I've asked for stuff like that and gotten it. \n\nCynical me say they're buying cheap, yet large gifts that have visual impact so they can feel like they're sooo generous. So if they gave the cash equivalent, you'd see how cheap they were being. LOL. \n\nI have a niece who has waaaaay too much crap.
