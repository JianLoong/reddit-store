We are very fortunate to have friends and family happy to give us their old clothes and items when their children outgrow them, and so despite me being on a very low income he doesn't go without.\n\nLast Christmas I noticed that he was starting to just tip out all his toys and then trip over, get upset, or just want to sit down. I looked things up and realised he was probably overwhelmed and not able to play because there was just too much stuff to the point it just became mess and clutter. So I tried to say no thankyou to presents and redirect relatives to buy size up clothing, books or experiences for him but almost everyone still bought toys and items which just added to the stuff. I got very frustrated with Easter just passed, when multiple people have him gifts (Easter isn't a gift giving holiday!!!) Knowing that I was already struggling with the stuff from Christmas. And so, I have requested no gifts for his upcoming birthday. Despite it being awkward I have told people that he has a savings account which will go towards his one day tertiary study, car or house.\n\nLast night I was at his grandma's house (father's mother) and she mentioned \"I know you said no gifts but I got him something, hope you don't mind\" with a grin. In the politest way possible I said thankyou but I'm really running out of space. Then his aunt said a similar thing. Then his step mum again \"you said no gifts but...\" And I was like seriously? You all know we live in a tiny place and it's really overwhelming. \n\nShe said I was being ungrateful, I am cruel to expect a 2 year old to get nothing for his birthday, taking that experience and excitement from him, and I should just clear out his old toys when he's not looking. I honestly think they're being assholes by disrespecting my boundary, and expecting me to deal with his tantrums from having too much stuff, work out how to clean or store it all, and make him give away his things to make room!

Say it nicely but firmly. \n\n2) Tell them that all the toys they give will need to stay at their house. It'll be great because every time you take him over there, he'll have new toys to play with!\n\n3) If you have a partner, they need to back you up on this. You must present a united front.", "NTA.\n\nLook as a relative its soo nice to see a little one get a new toy from you and be so very, happy, excited and appreciative. But that's not the reality of your situation. I'm sure they dont want to be the one responsible for forcing a little one to pick between a bunch if toys that he loves.\n\nAs your family doesn't seem to want to gift practical items because your son won't be excited in the same way, maybe you could try experiences instead? Son doesn't want any new toys because he has enough, but he really wants to go to the zoo/disneyland/holiday/magic show. Could you help us to fund that?", "NTA, not at all.  I had a similar issue and also tried to have no-gift-birthdays.  You are NOT being cruel or mean, do not let them bs you - you are being practical.  I think older relatives have the hardest time with the idea of no gifts.  It worked better with our younger relatives - they were happy to give books and experiences (art classes, a train ride, zoo pass, etc.) One option for you - think of donating some of the gifts.  Childrens ward at the hospital, or a local day care would love your extra things.", "nta. cruel to a 2 yr to get nothing for a bday? A 2 year old doesn't care, they're like cats, they'll play more with the box that the toy came in than  the actual toy. I'd say either stand up to them and tell them you won't be accepting any gifts or take them and donate them to a children's charity.", "My daughter just turned 2 twelve days ago and she got exactly 0 gifts from me... granted we're in a situation of not having a place to live right now, but still. Even if we did, for me it was buying her an experience. We got pizza and went to an arcade, and had cake and she had a BLAST. Very often she gets overwhelmed or doesn't care about her toys. So others can send them and I focus on the experiences and core memories. She does not hate me for this. \n\nNTA, don't let others make it seem like you're being selfish. I do think the donation to the account is a bit much; but you still gave other options too. If anything you could make a wishlist on somewhere like Amazon or elsewhere of things he does need or whatnot, that helps usually. Or give ideas on things to do (tickets to the zoo, to the aquarium, to a learning museum, etc). If they're still disrespecting it, then honey they are most definitely the AH.", "Its weird how \"No toys\" turns into \"No gifts at all\" when you provided alternate suggestions of gifts such as books and contributions for your sons college fund. \n\nBut INFO also what happens if a bunch of folks end up sending books?

Have they been made aware the sheer amount is overwhelming to your son and is not just a \"I don't want to have to deal with organization?\"  Either way, they're still kinda being disrespectful since you asked for no gifts, but it sounds like from their perspective, it may look like a two year old is being deprived of toys because mom is tired of cleaning. Definitely not saying that's the case, but how much have they been told?", "NTA I\u2019m sorry nobody in the family is listening to you. Have you explained that he gets overstimulated when presented with too many options? \n\nI have a similar situation and my little one never grew out if it. She\u2019s 6 now and still gets overstimulated by clutter and too many options. I am lucky that I do have ONE relative that just gives cash to put into her college fund. And an aunt that always gives books, which she LOVES. She\u2019s excited to get presents, sure, but then they never even get touched. She got a cool present for Christmas and has played with it one time and that was only because a playmate came over and wanted to play with it with her.", "NTA. \n\nYou'll get pushback.\n\nI argued with my mom about this for a few years when my kids were small.

You told them no toys and you told them why, I agree with some of the comments I\u2019ve seen a bout donating them and I like the idea you mentioned in your post about financial gifts going to his college fund/savings. That said, it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re being malicious by getting him toys it\u2019s just not getting through to them that it\u2019s just clutter that they\u2019re gifting, which must be really frustrating. Maybe you could try more firmly outlining why they really shouldn\u2019t give him toys?

It will stop him getting overwhelmed with to many toys and the excitement of new toys every couple of months is worth it even though they are just his other toys it feel like something new to him. Nta presents at that age are over rated maybe asked for toy gift cards so you can get some toys as he grows and put them into circulation.", "NTA\\INFO. no toys <> no gifts. which one is it. Excess toys can be left and gradmas house for all the times you'll be coming over to play.", "Don\u2019t ask people to contribute to his college fund.

As a person who firmly believes in less toys or only developmental toys and a little bit of here and there, I believe you have the right to actually tell them no. Maybe for next time just make a card for holidays. All possible holiday's and say no gifts . And to your near and dear ones ask them to contribute to college fund. \n\nI mean this is so amazing. Your idea. Instead of filling dumps with garbage that your child will outgrow in a few months, the money even if 10 15 dollars will go a long way. It might mean a hot meal on a difficult day. \n\nI have a young niece and the amount of plastic I see with in her toy closet makes my blood boil. But she ain't my child and her mother is fulfilling some childhood fantasy as she didn't have much toys. How difficult it is for grown ass people to understand that this is not the future for your child.\n\nEvery plastic toy you buy , the child might outgrow it soon esp in young ages and it's going to a fill. Sorry for being a sour puss. But a 2 yr old doesn't know much and hence we should be the ones (the parents) to actually take care of it and teach them not to be potential hoarders lol.", "No space I understand. But not all gifts take up space. Going to a water park or carnival or something like that costs money, is fun and takes up no space afterwards.", "mild YTA because you have discovered you can't stop the madness. You can be the mom though - and for every new toy that is given, one goes away to charity. Even if they are age appropriate and still in good condition.\n\nOther than that, you could try to come up with some vertical storage solutions.", "YTA you don't want to deal with his tantrums. He's 2 years old. Terrible twos ever heard of it. You are taking away his experience. What kind of mother wants her kid to sit there on his birthday and not get presents. Cycle out his older toys its what every parent does. Easter is a gift giving holiday its usually small gifts in a basket along with chocolate. You should be so grateful your child has loving and gift giving people in his life. Some kids don't have that.", "Mild ESH.  Your relatives are definitely being shitty to you and violating the very clear boundary you set.  Right now it's cluttered toys, but they are also demonstrating that if they think something is part of a \"normal childhood\", they're just going to do it whether you want them to or not.\n\nHowever, they are also right.  Getting so frustrated over clutter that you declare no gifts for your kids birthday is a non sustainable solution, and yes it will definitely impact your kid.\n\nTo everyone saying \"he's only two he won't remember this\".  You're right, he won't remember it, which is why it will be confusing and frightening to him that birthdays and clutter give him anxiety as an adult.  The shit that happens to us as infants and toddlers MATTERS.  Things like what the OP described aren't isolated incidents that don't connect to anything else in life.  If OP is that frustrated with the situation, it is guaranteed to change their behavior in countless ways they won't even notice, but their kid definitely will.\n\nYou haven't done anything egregious or awful, but you're going to need to figure out a better solution before he turns 3, and to have a serious and explicit talk with your relatives about boundaries and your kid.  I'd also encourage you to think about your own relationship with the idea of \"clutter\".", "YTA, nobody HAS to get your son anything. You can make suggestions of what would be more helpful, but at the end of the day, it's their money and you're sounding very entitled.\n\nAlso, speaking as someone who once was a kid, it's really disappointing to get a cash donation or an educational book for your birthday. I get that the clutter is stressing you out, but seriously just take an hour before the holiday and throw a bunch of crap in a donation bag.\n\nHow is a book less clutter?", "ESH - Why don\u2019t you just donate all his toys away? That way your house doesn\u2019t get cluttered up and your son doesn\u2019t get overwhelmed with new amounts of toys. Or at very least have a yard sale or something similar and sell them. \n\nAsking people to contribute financially to your son\u2019s account seems a bit awkward. I understand the clothes part though.", "YTA Also, IDK what country you're in but yeah, Easter is a gift holiday where I live (although at that age it's mostly candy). Look, you can always donate the gifts if your son doesn't like them or play with them. Just take it and say thank you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's why I plan to have a kid's basketball hoop at my house for my nephew to play with when he comes over, since my yard is much more spacious than the one at nephew's home. \n\nIf grandma really wanted to get something for the kid, clothing is a thing.

My sister and brother in law have a lovely apartment and her mother who's loving and caring keeps buying enormous things they just have zero space for (they tried tonsell and move before he was even born but no one bought it so they were stuck) she's done what the top comment suggested and makes mom keep it at her place, which is great because she babysits once a week or so anyway.", "I mean I\u2019m I\u2019m with you on this but like, babies and toddlers need books long before they can read so that\u2019s a weird comment. My kids all have loved books before they could read because I read to them or they looked at picture.", "I used to buy from library sale when it was buck a bag.   I had to rehome hundreds if books.  \n\n Everyone writes series now, so I might have book three and nine of a series.\n\nTrying to get rest meant libraries, used book stores and more time & money(&space) than I could afford.", "So you don't have kids or know any then. Most two year olds prefer the wrapping paper or the box the item came in", "My mom and I started accounts for the nibblings, and it was sad when I started to have to give them actual gifts instead of money for their accounts. I can't afford to do both, and they are big enough to notice if I don't give them presents to open now. It sucks having five family birthdays in the month surrounding Christmas. I always end up too broke.", "Could you resell some of the toys and deposit the money into his account?", "NTA. That really sounds like too many toys.", "Oh I'm so sorry they're being like that. Buying you a ticket would be his gift like you said. That's just, what a reasoning they have \ud83e\udd37\n\nIf people are that stubborn and care more about themselves than about your son, I'd be more than fair to tell them this. Apparently their joy is more important than the joy of a 2yo and they should be ashamed.\n\nHonestly I think it's fine if you sell some of the gifts so you can buy yourself a zoo ticket. And like other people said, donate the rest. This way everyone gets what they want, albeit in a complicated way. And you can make other people happy.", "What do the other parents tell their children when they get the toys and give them to you? You say he is tripping over them and he is overwhelmed, does he sleep in that room? Why not sort them out when he is resting and remove those he no longer plays with? I have 3 sons and a 2 year old rarely remembers toys especially when he has many as you claim.", "Bro\u2026as you said. He has so much toys he can\u2019t play with all them and trips over them? Why would you do it in front of him anyway? Dumb asl", "This obviously isn\u2019t only going to apply when he\u2019s 2, get real.", "Donating them is wasteful? You\u2019re so far into your own controlling whatever you have going on you\u2019re not even reading the replies.", "See if your area has a Buy Nothing group where you can take the toys, or a women's shelter. Women's shelters often love to receive things like toys because women running from domestic violence with their kids often don't have anything but the clothes on their backs. Those organizations will take a lot of stuff you wouldn't immediately think of being donateable.", "Also like, your reasoning doesn\u2019t make sense because how does he understand sustainability but not that he won\u2019t get toys? Lol", "Just don\u2019t accept it.\n\n\u201cNo really, when we said we didn\u2019t want it we were being serious. Thank you so much. I know it\u2019s coming from a place of love. But no thank you\u201d\n\n\nAnd then just let them be salty about it. That\u2019s a \u201cthem problem\u201d", "Yeah it makes no sense, I'd much rather give money for my grandkids future than some toys they won't play with for more than ten minutes. My youngest grandson turned 1 a couple of weeks ago and I didn't get him anything but gave my daughter money to get him some clothes as he's needing some spring and summer outfits. He has a tonne of hand me down toys etc so it would be silly to waste that money on more toys. People are weird lol", "Tell them you need the gift receipts. Because if they can\u2019t follow directions like grown ups, then maybe you can exchange those toys for things he DOES need.", "If nothing else, can you sell the toys and put that money in his account?", "i ALWAYS contributed cash whenever a someone had an account set up for their kid because i knew there were always going to be a  gazillion family members who bought toys and/or clothes. i started doing this as a teenager once i saw that the adorable outfits i was buying my nieces & nephews were only able to be worn for a stupidly short amount of time bc of how quickly they outgrew everything. so as much as i loved finding/buying things like little bomber jackets or dr suess pajamas, i realized it wasn't anything they really 'needed' .... so if a 16 year old can come to terms with that then i think adults should be able to follow suit.\n\nmeanwhile i'm now wondering when someone is gonna buy ME some dr suess pajamas. i have 'grinch' pjs that i always wore all december long but i'm way too traditional to wear them after the new year. it's my version of 'no white after labor day' LOL", "Reiterating what I first posted, yes. Throw them out on those people's floors.", "Correct. My eldest is nearly 4 so can't really read yet but has memorised a few of the books that we used to read to her - some of them from when she was younger than OPs son. It has definitely helped with her development", "Yeah, please OP, kids need books before they can read. Age appropriate ones. Tou need to read it with them and stop at pictures etc. My 4 year old nice brings a story with her when she goes to the bathroom and starts telling herself the story out loud. She has loved books since she was very little.", "It's August for me! Bloody August, guess November is boring where I'm from. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI just package the money like a present, in a special card with a bow and all.  I honestly can't bring myself to buy them more plastic crap - my niece has two boys and her house looks like a plastic waste recycling centre after Christmas.  I'm not stupid enough to think that a lot of it isn't just being thrown or given away.", "Last year one of my friends gave us a box of diapers and wrapped it. That was a great gift !", "He is 2. And is obviously dependant on his mom. Even if he was 40 and married, if his partner says stop buying so many (whatever things he likes to collect) because there's literally no space for them anywhere, it should be ignored because it's not for them? \n\n\nThe 2 year old isn't the one running the household and cleaning up and making sure there's space for the toys", "It doesn\u2019t have to be a charity. Put them outside the dollar general with a sign that says free. Take them to a church. Give them to a neighbor\u2026we pretty much all have kids here, the age your son is he is rapidly going through age appropriate toys, they don\u2019t last that long anyways as he will need non baby toys to keep him occupied", "She said throwing them OUT is wasteful, not donating them. She's struggling to find a place to donate the toys and doesn't want to send them all to the landfill.", " I want to be part of the present giving experience.", "Again, when you become a parent you become responsible for a life THAT IS NOT YOURS", "It is relevant actually. I know a lot of writers who give books as gifts, they have never given a single book. Always a few. \n\nBut regardless, an open book that\u2019s fallen on the floor takes up as much room as a toy. The only time it doesn\u2019t is when it\u2019s been put away, which, come on. A 2-3 year old is not keeping everything perfectly tidy.", "So you seriously think this woman is going to suddenly say \u201coh yes, toys are fine!\u201d When the kid is 5? Hysterical.", "There are so many solutions besides dictating that a person can\u2019t get toys on their birthday. Churches, Facebook, neighbors, a sign on the side of the road that says \u201cFree\u201d bringing a trash bag of old toys to the birthday and saying here, \u201che\u2019s grown out of these ones please take them back\u201d etc etc.\n\nThe OP is a fully capable adult that can apparently raise a child and can\u2019t figure out what to do with extra stuff? I don\u2019t think so.", "A 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 year old isn\u2019t going to have a hobby the same way an 11 year old does."]}
